      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Onboard processing and communication:</strong> Miniaturised processors and antennas enable satellites to perform data collection, processing and transmission autonomously, reducing dependence on ground stations.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>AAC Clyde Space develops onboard communication subsystems, including high-performance radios and transceivers, designed for reliable data downlink in smallsat constellations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Archangel Lightworks is an innovative UK company focusing on free-space optical communications, enabling high-speed data transfer between satellites and ground stations using laser-based systems.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="applications-of-small-satellites-in-national-security">Applications of Small Satellites in National Security</h3>

<p>Small satellites are pivotal in national security due to their flexibility and deployability. The UK could use them for:</p>

<ul>

<h3 id="space-launch-systems">Space Launch Systems</h3>

<p>It may seem obvious, but a satellite that remains tethered to terra has little purpose. Satellites need to be in space; thus, the success of small satellites depends on reliable and adaptable launch systems. The UK’s renewed focus on launch capability – highlighted by the development of spaceports such as Spaceport Cornwall and SaxaVord Spaceport – signals its commitment to ensuring sovereign access to space.</p>

<p><em>Innovations in Launch Technology</em></p>

<p>Launch vehicles designed for small satellites are smaller, lighter and more efficient than traditional rockets. Notable features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dedicated launches:</strong> Unlike shared launches, dedicated systems transport small payloads to specific orbits, offering greater control and responsiveness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reusable components:</strong> As demonstrated by SpaceX and adopted by UK-based start-ups, innovations such as reusable rocket stages significantly reduce costs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eco-friendly propulsion:</strong> Orbex, for example, a UK-based orbital launch services company, is developing rockets using bio-propane, a low-carbon alternative to traditional rocket fuels.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Applications in National Security</em></p>

<p>Launch systems enable rapid deployment of small satellites, which is crucial during crises or conflicts. For instance, if adversaries disrupt satellite constellations, quick-response launch capabilities can replace or augment assets, maintaining critical services such as communication and ISR.</p>

<p><em>Sustainable Space Practices</em></p>

<p>With 40,500 pieces of debris (greater than 10 cm) and 130 million pieces of debris (between 1 mm and 1 cm) in orbit, sustainable space practices are no longer optional – they are imperative. The UK has already taken a global leadership role in promoting responsible space stewardship through policy, innovation and international diplomacy, and it should be noted that the UK led the work for UN General Assembly Resolution 75/36, “Reducing Space Threats Through Norms, Rules and Principles of Responsible Behaviours”.</p>

<p><em>Technical Approaches to Sustainability</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Space debris mitigation:</strong> Companies such as 3S Northumbria are designing sustainable space solutions, including space surveillance systems and supporting software, grounded in the principles of a circular economy for space, with space situational awareness at the heart of the work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Design for disposal:</strong> New satellites are engineered for planned decommissioning. Lightweight materials and controlled de-orbiting mechanisms ensure minimal long-term impact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Propellant-free manoeuvring:</strong> Emerging technologies use solar sails or other innovative means for orbit adjustments without traditional propulsion.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>National Security Implications</em></p>

<p>Sustainability of space is not only about ethics; it should be a national security priority. Space debris directly threatens active satellites, including those essential to defence and intelligence. The UK’s emphasis on sustainability ensures its assets are protected while setting a global standard for responsible space exploration.</p>

<h4 id="intersections-with-other-technologies">Intersections with Other Technologies</h4>

<p>The technologies driving UK space power – small satellites, launch systems and sustainable practices – intersect with transformative fields such as AI, quantum technologies, advanced telecommunications and additive manufacturing. These intersections amplify the capabilities of these technologies, enabling innovative applications across civil and national security domains.</p>

<p><em>AI</em></p>

<p>AI enhances the functionality of small satellites by enabling autonomous decision-making, real-time data analysis and efficient constellation management. For example, AI-driven algorithms can optimise satellite orbits to avoid collisions or adjust sensor focus for targeted intelligence collection. This reduces the need for constant ground control and increases operational resilience.</p>

<p><em>Quantum Technologies</em></p>

<p>Quantum computing and quantum communication, as led by UK company Arqit, are reshaping satellite security. Quantum key distribution (QKD), a breakthrough in encryption, ensures unbreakable communication links. Integrating QKD into small satellites offers secure communications for defence applications, safeguarding critical infrastructure against cyber threats.</p>

<p><em>Advanced Telecommunications</em></p>

<p>Small satellites underpin the development of global communication networks, particularly in underserved areas. They intersect with 5G and future 6G networks to deliver high-speed, resilient connectivity. This capability supports not only commercial markets but also secure military communications and remote operations.</p>

<p>Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, accelerates the production of satellite components and launch vehicles. This technology enables rapid prototyping, lightweight designs and cost-efficient manufacturing, allowing UK start-ups to innovate and compete globally.</p>

<h3 id="relevance-of-technologies-for-national-security">Relevance of Technologies for National Security</h3>

<p>The suite of technologies encompassing small satellite design, launch systems and sustainable space practices plays a critical role in enhancing the UK’s national security. These technologies contribute to strategic resilience, geopolitical influence and the safeguarding of critical infrastructure in an increasingly contested and competitive space domain.</p>

<p><em>Strategic and Geopolitical Implications</em></p>

<p>Space is recognised as critically important to national security. Small satellites and launch capabilities provide the UK with a sovereign ability to monitor, communicate and respond to threats, ensuring strategic independence from international providers. Geopolitically, the UK’s leadership in sustainable space initiatives, such as promoting norms of responsible behaviour at the UN (for example, Resolution 75/36), positions it as a global leader in ethical space governance.</p>

<p><em>Dependencies and Supply Chains</em></p>

<p>National security is intricately tied to the resilience of supply chains for satellite components and launch systems. The UK relies on small domestic companies, such as SSTL and In-Space Missions, to build satellites. However, certain materials and technologies, such as high-performance processors and radiation-hardened components, still depend on imports. Mitigating these dependencies requires investment in domestic production capabilities and securing international partnerships.</p>

<p><em>Public Perception and Policy Questions</em></p>

<p>Public discussions around space often centre on its benefits – connectivity, climate monitoring and disaster response – but awareness of its security implications is growing. Questions about the growing militarisation of space, space debris and competition with countries such as China and Russia are shaping policy debates. A transparent and balanced approach to national security, aligned with ethical and sustainable space practices, reduces the risk of security dilemma while strengthening public trust and political legitimacy.</p>

<p><em>Collaborations and International Engagements</em></p>

<p>The UK actively collaborates on international initiatives that bolster its space capabilities. Partnerships with organisations such as the European Space Agency, the Five Eyes intelligence alliance and NATO support the development of cutting-edge technologies and strategic interoperability.
