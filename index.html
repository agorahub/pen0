  <p>11月8号在将军澳尚德发生了一系列事件，我目击了其中一小部分，以下是目击报告。（上一篇“荃湾开花事件”发生在这件事之后两天，下一篇我将记录11月17号的佐敦事件）</p>

<p><strong>10:36 新闻</strong></p>

<p>读到周梓乐去世的消息，估计今天尚德一定会发生很多事情。</p>

<p>从坑口经过文曲里，再穿过将军澳运动场，就可以看到商德停车场了。停车场是尚德邨两栋大厦的底座，一共三层，第三层由天桥和尚德广场、富康花园商场以及将军澳运动场相连，是附近居民区的交通要道。四天前的冲突中，周梓乐就是从第三层跌落到第二层而受伤以致死亡的。我没有立刻上去，在富康花园商场逛了一下，这里有菜市场和干货铺，但没有卖花的店铺。</p>

  <p>到了十一月份，事情发展到了顶峰，他们发起了三罢行动，希望瘫痪城市以迫使政府回应诉求。理工大学（Polytechnic University）外的红磡隧道是城市的要道，被成功封锁，但他们同时也被警方包围在了理大校园里面。</p>

<p>11月17号，经过一天的战斗，包围圈渐渐缩小直至关闭，学校内有一千多人被困。夜晚，“救Poly”的呼声在网络上蔓延。</p>

<p><strong>弥敦道</strong></p>

<p>晚上10点半，巴士在美孚被堵，有黑衣人在路上设路障，我只能下车步行。过了几条街又上了另一架巴士，因为旺角地区的活动，车最终也只到深水埗。下车时离理大还有4.7公里，步行应该不到一个小时。</p>

<p>弥敦道上已无车辆，马路上很多人，有些路口地下有砖块。另一些路口已有路障，还有被烧过的垃圾，消防员救熄之后正在离去。</p>

  <p>2019年11月10号晚，荃湾内街发生了“开花”事件，我和Betty目击了19:30到22:50的事件片段，本文是目击记录。</p>

<p><strong>19:30 前奏</strong></p>

<p>我和Betty决定去看看荃湾开花的现场。下了楼穿过荃湾公园，过了杨屋道，沿着禾笛街走到沙咀道。</p>

  <h5 style="margin:.5em 0 1em 0; font-weight:200; font-style:italic; text-align:right">Thomas Payne | 1776.02.15</h5>
  <p>Some writers have so confounded society with government, as to leave little or no distinction between them; whereas they are not only different, but have different origins. Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedness; the former promotes our happiness positively by uniting our affections, the latter negatively by restraining our vices. The one encourages intercourse, the other creates distinctions.</p>

<p>The first a patron, the last a punisher. <q>Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil</q></p>

<p>Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer.</p>

<p>Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expence and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others.</p>

<p>There are some who say – There are some who say that communism is the wave of the future. And there are some who say, in Europe and elsewhere, we can work with the Communists. And there are even a few who say that it is true that communism is an evil system, but it permits us to make economic progress.</p>

  <p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p>

<p>But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.</p>

<p>In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the “unalienable Rights” of “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.”</p>

  <h5 style="margin:.5em 0 1em 0; font-weight:200; font-style:italic; text-align:right"> | 2005.06.13</h5>
  <p>I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.</p>

<p>The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: “We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?” They said: “Of course.”</p>

<p>My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college. And 17 years later I did go to college.</p>

  <p>不好意思重发一次，之前在路上无法在文章里放视频。</p>

<p>这段MV是今年春天三月到六月时，我们经过法国和瑞士时拍的，主要记录我们每天扎营做饭以及路上见到的各种人物、动物、风景。</p>

<p>前后9分钟，没有说什么话，但配着Mew的Comforting Sounds，观看时最好带上耳机。</p>

<p>现在看来，那段旅程好像发生在另一个世纪，天真而遥远，每天就是最基本最简单的生活。虽然再过三个月我们又要回到路上，不知道是否还能进入那种无忧无虑的状态。</p>

<p>最后一段是从法国翻越一个山坳到达瑞士，看到云中的城市时，我兴奋地大叫。那天是六月九号。</p>

<p>2019年可能是我人生中最重要的一年。之前每个10年，我都以为自己变化足够大了，可能人到中年，会平稳下来，不再改变观念，不再接受不再愤怒不再恐惧不再茫然。这一年是一个响亮的反证。</p>

<p>新年快乐。</p>
