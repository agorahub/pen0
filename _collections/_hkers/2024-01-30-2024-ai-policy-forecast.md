### 2023 TOP TAKEAWAYS

_The Wadhwani Center's Key Takeaways from Developments in AI Last Year_

> #### `U.S. senate majority leader Chuck Schumer`
> #### `June 21, 2023`
> _`Now, friends, we come together at a moment of revolution, not one of weapons or of political power, but a revolution in science and understanding that will change humanity. It’s been said that what the locomotive and electricity did for human muscle a century and a half ago, artificial intelligence is doing for human knowledge today as we speak. But the effect of AI is far more profound and will certainly occur over a much shorter period of time.`_

#### Existential risk became a mainstream concern for AI governance.

Though the risk of AI leading to catastrophe or human extinction had been a focus for Elon Musk and many AI researchers in prior years, 2023 saw the issue become a genuine priority among global leaders and government policymakers. The shift was led by calls from high-profile figures in the private sector such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, Tesla and xAI CEO Elon Musk, and AI “godfather” Geoffrey Hinton. In May, a coalition of over 350 leading AI experts and executives signed a one-sentence statement that “mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” This statement immediately led to a rhetorical shift among global policymakers.

Concern about AI’s malign impact on civilization trickled down to the wider U.S. public. A survey of more than 20,000 Americans by YouGov in April 2023 reported that 46 percent were concerned about AI’s potential to cause human extinction and 69 percent supported a proposed six-month pause on AI development.

Similar anxieties about the potential catastrophic risk of AI echoed around Washington last year. At a congressional hearing in May, Sam Altman warned that AI could “cause significant harm to the world” and urgently called for greater regulation of the technology. IBM vice president and chief privacy and trust officer Christina Montgomery concurred, “with AI the stakes are simply too high,” and “what we need at this pivotal moment is clear, reasonable policy and sound guardrails.”

At the UK AI Safety Summit, 29 countries attending agreed to the Bletchley Declaration, which stated that “there is potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional, stemming from the most significant capabilities of these AI models.”

#### The United States, the Netherlands, and Japan coordinated export controls to target China’s AI and semiconductor technology development . . .

In late January 2023, reports emerged that the United States had reached an agreement with the Netherlands and Japan for the two countries to impose new export controls restricting China’s access to chipmaking tools. Earlier, on October 7, 2022, the United States had imposed strict controls on exports of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) technology to China; however, as Japanese and Dutch companies produced important SME technology, such unilateral action had a limited effect. Details on what was included in these new restrictions were scarce until March 2023, when the two countries formally announced they would be moving forward with export controls on a wide range of semiconductor equipment and technology. Neither country explicitly mentioned China as the target.

Japan and the Netherlands capture 99 percent of the world’s market share of lithography steppers and scanners — crucial for state-of-the-art AI chips. Therefore, this was a major step forward in the U.S. mission to bar China from gaining the lead in the chip race. Still, other countries like Germany and South Korea are also significant producers in the semiconductor value chain, and the United States will need to persuade them both to get on board with controls if they want to continue to slow China’s technological advancements.

#### . . . However, their success in slowing China’s technological progress remains mixed.

Despite international efforts to prevent China from making significant technological advancements, the announcement of Huawei’s new Mate60 smartphone raised concerns throughout the national security community about the efficacy of the export controls. On October 17, 2023, the United States’ Bureau of Industry and Security announced updates to the October 7 controls. These updates included additional parameters for chips’ performance density, the restriction of dozens more items of semiconductor equipment, the expansion of licensing requirements to an additional 22 countries that the United States has an arms embargo with, and the addition of 13 companies to the entity list.

#### AI chatbots reached billions of users worldwide and continued growing rapidly in scale.

OpenAI’s ChatGPT reached over one million users in its first week of launch in November 2022. By November 2023, that number had skyrocketed to more than 100 million monthly active users. OpenAI’s success speaks to a wider public entrancement with AI chatbots around the world. Leading AI development companies launched several new large language models (LLMs) last year, including OpenAI’s updated ChatGPT-4, Meta’s LlaMa 2, and Google’s Gemini. The global demand for this technology has prompted many companies to develop chatbots trained on other languages, such as the Arabic model Jais and the Chinese model Ernie Bot, though the United States still leads in the worldwide development of LLMs.

Language models are getting bigger, both in terms of the data they are trained on and their parameters (GPT-4, for example, is rumored to have up to one trillion parameters, compared to GPT-3’s 175 billion). In fact, models have grown so large that there are legitimate concerns that companies are reaching the limits of the existing available text training data. However, their growing size comes with growing costs. While training costs are rarely disclosed by companies developing LLMs, OpenAI stated that developing and training GPT-4 cost more than $100 million, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei suggested that future training costs could exceed $1 billion. Growing CO2 emissions and water usage from training and operating chatbots are also attracting increased attention in terms of their effect on the environment. What these upward trends mean for AI chatbots’ profitability and scalability remains to be seen this year.

#### Major economies around the world took substantial steps to regulate AI . . .

_The United States_

In response to the transformative potential of AI, the U.S. government began to regulate it through administrative law, acknowledging the imperative to navigate the complexities of AI risks and begin establishing domestic standards. On January 26, 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) unveiled the Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0). Developed in close collaboration with both private and public sectors, the AI RMF serves as a comprehensive tool for organizations engaging with AI technologies and is designed to adapt to the evolving AI landscape. Though the RMF is not intended to be applied as part of formal regulation, many have held the framework up as substantial progress in maturing AI governance.

Announced in June 2023 at CSIS, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s SAFE Innovation Framework marked a strategic effort to confront the profound changes brought about by AI through “comprehensive legislation.” Since September 2023, Capitol Hill has seen over 150 AI experts gather as part of Senator Schumer’s AI Insight Forums. These forums have covered an array of crucial topics, from AI innovation and workforce considerations to national security and guarding against doomsday scenarios. Notably, the ninth forum, held on December 6, 2023, featured a testimony from the Wadhwani Center’s director, Gregory Allen. This forum focused on maximizing AI development to bolster the United States’ military capabilities, aligning with Senator Schumer’s vision for an “all-hands-on-deck” effort.

Ahead of the UK AI Safety Summit, the Biden administration announced its Executive Order on Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in late October 2023. The order broadly focused on the development of standards and testing mechanisms for AI safety, infrastructure, and social consequences (such as discrimination and effects on labor). Since the announcement, executive agencies like the Department of Defense (DOD) and State Department have released their policies on AI and detailed how the executive order’s directives will be applied in their respective agencies.

> #### `U.S. president Joe Biden`
> #### `October 30, 2023`
> _`We face a genuine inflection point in history, one of those moments where the decisions we made in the very near term are going to set the course for the next decades. And with the position we lead the world, the toughest challenges are the greatest opportunities. Look, there’s no greater change that I can think of in my life than AI presents as a potential: exploring the universe, fighting climate change, ending cancer as we know it, and so much more.`_

_The European Union_

On December 8, the European Union passed its Artificial Intelligence Act, the world’s most substantial set of regulations on AI so far. After two and a half years in the making, the act was finally agreed upon following a lengthy 37-hour negotiation between EU states and the European Parliament. EU commissioner Thierry Breton confirmed the event on X, stating that “the EU becomes the very first continent to set clear rules for the use of AI” in passing the AI Act and calling it a “launch pad for EU start-ups and researchers to lead the global AI race.” Not all EU leaders agree, however; French president Emmanuel Macron condemned the act on December 11, saying “we can decide to regulate much faster and much stronger than our major competitors. But we will regulate things that we will no longer produce or invent. This is never a good idea.”

The AI Act regulates all AI sold, used, or deployed within the European Union apart from AI used for military purposes, research, and open-source models, though most provisions only apply to the “high-risk” AI systems. It advances a risk-based approach to managing AI systems by sorting levels of risk into four categories: unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal to none. Unacceptable risks banned under the act include the use of AI for manipulating human behavior, social scoring, and creating biometric databases based on sensitive social categories such as race or religion. The consequences for failing to comply with these rules are steep: under the new rules, companies could be fined €35 million or 7 percent of global revenue.

Full implementation of the new AI law is not expected to begin until 2025 at the earliest, allowing time for the European Commission to establish a regulatory oversight “AI office” in Brussels and companies to adapt to the new rules.

_China_

In August 2023, China’s generative AI measures went into effect. At the time, these measures were some of the most comprehensive regulations on AI and focused on a regulatory framework for generative AI services to the Chinese public. Earlier in the year, China released a draft that placed significant responsibility onto service providers on topics like ensuring the legality of the data used for training and optimization. Service providers would be met with a fine upwards of 100,000 yuan if they failed to meet these standards. However, the finalized version only requires the service providers to create measures that prioritize desired values within data training and optimization. Shifting from the strict first draft to a more diluted final draft is likely a reflection of industry input as well as sensitivity to the current economic challenges that China is facing.

The measures apply to any AI generative technology that provides services that “generate any text, image, audio, video, or other such content to the public.” Services that are not offered to the public are explicitly excluded from the legislation. Additionally, prior to providing services to the public, service providers must apply for a security assessment. In implementation, these have not been difficult to get approved. Chinese military, intelligence, and police services remain broadly exempt from all Chinese AI regulations.

In October, the Chinese government announced its Global AI Governance Initiative at the third Belt and Road forum. Xi Jinping unveiled the initiative personally, underscoring China’s AI governance ambitions, which include enhancing information exchange and technological cooperation with other countries; developing open, fair, and efficient governing mechanisms; and establishing an international institution within the UN framework to govern AI. The initiative calls for representation and equal rights when developing AI, regardless of a country’s “size, strength, or social system.” The announcement came just weeks after the creation of a BRICS AI study group which aimed to foster closer AI governance ties among the participating nations.

#### . . . and to strengthen international cooperation on AI governance.

Global efforts to govern AI increased dramatically in 2023. The United Kingdom hosted the first global AI Safety Summit on November 1–2, convening political and technology leaders for discussions focusing on foundation model safety. Attendees included summit host Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, Vice President Kamala Harris, prominent tech CEOs, and, to the surprise of many, China’s vice minister of science and technology, Wu Zhaohui. The most significant achievement of the summit was the Bletchley Declaration, which Sunak called a “landmark achievement that sees the world’s greatest AI powers agree on the urgency behind understanding the risks of AI.” The declaration broadly aims to promote transparency and accountability within companies developing frontier AI models and to develop AI safety evaluation metrics, tools, and research capabilities.

AI also featured prominently in G7 meetings in 2023, including the Digital and Technology Ministers’ Meeting in April and the G7 summit in May. The group released the G7 leaders’ statement, the Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems, and the Hiroshima Process International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems. The code of conduct was the most consequential of the documents, laying out a set of voluntary guidelines for developing advanced AI systems, such as foundation models and generative AI. It is worth noting that these documents set out voluntary guidelines as opposed to binding international regulations. The G7 countries will also publish the Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework.

Several other international assemblies gathered in 2023 to discuss AI for the first time. In February, the Responsible AI in the Military Domain Summit (REAIM) in The Hague, Netherlands, convened ministers to discuss the responsible use of AI for military applications. In July, the United Nations Security Council met to discuss AI risk, at which Secretary-General António Guterres called for the creation of a UN body “to support collective efforts to govern this extraordinary technology.” The urgent need for international cooperation on balancing potential risks and benefits from AI was a common theme across all these governance efforts.

What remains to be seen is how international pledges will translate into real-world impact in 2024. Last year brought many voluntary commitments and high-level declarations. This is a start. But perhaps the greater challenge will be seeing how the grittier details of legislation, funding, and international standards unfold within a window of interest that may not last forever.

#### The private sector emphasized its own role in responsible AI governance.

As the U.S. government made significant steps to begin regulating AI in 2023, the private companies behind AI development have become more, not less, important in pursuing this goal. The government was proactive last year in collaborating with industry leaders to responsibly manage AI. This action has come, in part, from a recognition by Congress that it is playing catch-up to a technology and industry that far predates the government’s regulatory efforts in 2023. The majority of AI research and development exists in the private sector, as it takes extremely large datasets, technical expertise, and financial investment to develop the kinds of frontier AI models Congress is seeking to regulate. It would make sense, therefore, that Congress should seek AI companies’ input on AI legislation as it does with other industry leaders in other sectors. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer opened the first AI Insight Forum on September 13, which gathered senators, CEOs, and civil society leaders to discuss AI regulation, noting that “Congress cannot do it alone.” He added, “We need help of course from developers and experts who build AI systems.” The forums accompanied other congressional hearings that heard from AI CEOs like OpenAI’s Sam Altman and IBM’s Christina Montgomery last year.

In addition to congressional hearings, AI companies were given a greater responsibility to regulate their technologies in 2023 by Biden’s Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. The order requires AI developers conduct red teaming on their products and report their findings to the government before they are released, placing the onus on companies to do the heavy lifting when it comes to due diligence.

However, the private sector’s growing influence in AI governance is accompanied by growing concerns that there are fundamental conflicts of interest at play. AI companies’ dual role of helping to regulate their innovations as they continue to develop them raises serious questions about whether they can truly place safety over profit. As Marietje Shaake, international policy director at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center, wrote in the Financial Times, “Imagine the chief executive of JPMorgan explaining to Congress that because financial products are too complex for lawmakers to understand, banks should decide for themselves how to prevent money laundering, enable fraud detection and set liquidity to loan ratios. He would be laughed out of the room.” Just as lawmakers are not experts in other industries for which they craft legislation, she and others argue, they must be careful to not be captured by AI CEOs who use technical complexity to advance their own regulatory interests.

#### The number of AI-related lawsuits rose sharply.

New AI tools began to test existing legal frameworks in 2023, cutting across domains such as data privacy, copyright, and patent law. So far, the leading cause for lawsuits related to AI is related to data privacy, perhaps unsurprising considering the billions of data points that generative AI models are trained on from across the internet. AI companies have been resistant to revealing their training data thus far, despite long-running calls for greater transparency and concerns about user privacy from academics and civil society groups. A reported hack of ChatGPT in early December highlighted some basis for these concerns: when asked to repeat certain words like “poem” ad infinitum, ChatGPT eventually began to spit out sensitive training data, including phone numbers, names, and addresses. OpenAI has since closed this loophole by restricting ChatGPT from repeating words forever. It also announced in August that website owners can now block the company’s data-scraping web crawler, GPTBot, from accessing their pages and data for training purposes.

OpenAI has been one of many AI companies to face several lawsuits in 2023 due to alleged privacy and intellectual property violations. One class action lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft made headlines in June 2023 when it claimed that ChatGPT stole millions of sensitive data from hundreds of millions of internet users during training, including from social media accounts, medical records, and personal accounts. Though the complaint was dismissed in court, it was not the only one of its kind; a second lawsuit was filed against the same two companies in September and another, nearly identical, lawsuit was filed against Google parent company Alphabet in July. As of the time of writing, both cases are ongoing, though all three companies have moved to dismiss them in court.

The implications of AI for copyright law have also come under greater scrutiny in the last year. In 2023, Getty Images filed lawsuits in the United States and the United Kingdom against generative AI company Stability AI for training its model, Stable Diffusion, on copyrighted data and metadata. OpenAI, Alphabet, and Microsoft faced multiple class action cases from authors whose work, they claim, has been similarly used for training purposes without proper licensing or compensation. Text-to-image AI generators like Midjourney, DreamStudio, and DreamUp were the subject of a similar lawsuit filed in January by visual artists whose work has been used and replicated without permission.

Several companies, such as Meta, Microsoft, and Google, argued they should not have to pay to train AI models on copyrighted work, citing arguments such as AI training “is like the act of reading a book” and curbing access to copyrighted access would chill AI development. These kinds of arguments ask fundamental questions about AI regulation, like whether the unique characteristics of the technology should exempt it from certain laws.

Finally, the U.S. Federal Court Circuit upheld a precedent in patent law when it ruled in August that AI systems are not eligible to own patents for their “inventions” as they are not human beings. The verdict confirmed earlier rulings made by the U.S. Patent Office and the U.S. Copyright Office following years of legal disputes by U.S. computer scientist Stephen Thaler, who first tried to copyright an image produced by his AI system in 2019. Federal Circuit Judge Leonard Stark announced the decision in August saying “there is no ambiguity: the Patent Act requires that inventors must be natural persons; that is, human beings.” The ruling reflects similar decisions made in the United Kingdom and the European Union.

#### The Department of Defense took steps to safely adopt and deploy AI in its weapons systems . . .

The United States was the first country to codify a policy on autonomy in weapon systems when it first adopted DOD Directive 3000.09 in 2012. The policy did not ban the development or use of autonomous weapons — indeed many types of autonomous weapons, such as some missile defense and cyber weapons, had already been in use for decades. What 3000.09 did was place new policy and process requirements for the development and use of autonomous weapons in offensive and kinetic constructs. However, the policy was widely misunderstood as requiring “a human in the loop” and thus banning fully autonomous systems, which it did not do. In January 2023, the DOD published an updated 3000.09 that sought to address the confusion and to account for the rise in machine learning AI systems. Among other things, it formalized that adherence to the Department of Defense (DOD)’s AI Ethical Principles was a requirement at all stages of development and fielding. Reaffirmed by Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, the directive mandates rigorous testing, reviews, and senior-level scrutiny for autonomous systems, aligning with the DOD’s Ethical Principles and the Responsible AI (RAI) Strategy.

On the international front, the U.S. Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence, and Stability unveiled a ground-breaking “Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy.” This declaration is fully consistent with the ideas underpinning DOD 3000.09 and seeks to make them international, particularly among U.S. allies. Introduced at the Responsible AI in the Military Domain Summit, this initiative has since garnered signatures of support from 49 countries, promoting non-legally-binding guidelines for secure AI deployment in defense contexts.

#### . . . and to massively accelerate the DOD’s adoption of AI-enabled autonomous systems.

On August 28, 2023, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks announced the Replicator initiative. Replicator aims to “field attritable autonomous systems at scale of multiple thousands, in multiple domains, within the next 18-to-24 months.” The DOD intends for the initiative to counter China’s perceived advantage in military “mass” by rapidly acquiring and fielding large quantities of small, attritable, and relatively cheap drones. Reports suggest that this initiative was informed by analysis of the war in Ukraine.

Replicator will not solely focus on acquiring such systems; it will also build the processes that allow for “replicating the rapid adoption and delivery of technology.” This line of effort will try and build a pipeline that will enable similar efforts in the future. The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) will play a central role in Replicator, both working with Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) end users to establish what capabilities the warfighter needs and exploring which industry partners can provide those capabilities within the relevant time frame. At least for now, the DOD is not requesting any additional funding for Replicator; instead, the initiative will take advantage of “existing funding, existing programming lines, and existing authorities.” DOD officials claim the first Replicator systems will be delivered sometime between February and August 2025.

#### Corporate interest in AI surged, but the “Magnificent Seven” AI tech giants continued to capture stock markets and global attention.

AI was the magic word of 2023 for firms worldwide. Business intelligence company CB Insights reported that private investment in generative AI reached an all-time high last year with an almost 450 percent increase from $3.2 billion in 2022 to $17.4 billion by Q3 2023. As of March 2023, mentions of AI in executives’ earnings calls — where CEOs discuss corporate performance and strategies with investors and leading analysts — had grown by 77 percent compared to 2022. By September, that figure accelerated to a further 366 percent.

EY’s October CEO Outlook Pulse Survey, which interviews 1,200 CEOs globally every quarter, revealed that nearly all CEOs (99 percent) are conscious of AI’s potential to disrupt current business models and are planning investments into generative AI, either by redirecting capital from other projects (69 percent) or by raising new capital (23 percent). However, the rapid change of the AI ecosystem is a significant barrier to companies’ adoption of the technology: 26 percent stated that the breakneck speed in which AI is developing makes investments risky, while another 66 percent stated that the surrounding hype makes it difficult to ascertain whether other companies have legitimate AI capabilities for partnerships and mergers and acquisitions. To what extent companies effectively adopt AI tools into their business models once the hype settles remains to be seen in 2024.

In contrast, leading technology companies saw enormous returns in 2023. The “Magnificent Seven” (a term given to Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, and Nvidia) continued to dominate the stock market last year, breaking the record for holding the largest proportion of the S&P 500’s market cap at 29 percent. Goldman Sachs reported that the seven companies’ stocks accounted for 71 percent of total returns in 2023 while all other 493 other stocks made up just 6 percent. While comparably smaller AI companies have still attracted a surge in investment — including 15 new AI unicorns in 2023 as of Q3 — the lion’s share of attention in AI was focused on tech giants in 2023.

#### Rapid technological progress showed no signs of slowing down.

2023 was a groundbreaking year for AI, in terms of both raw model capability and the technology’s capacity to deliver remarkable breakthroughs in an increasing number of scientific fields. The end of the year saw a leap in generative AI capabilities as Google released its new multimodal system, Gemini, in December, possibly foreshadowing a new era for LLMs. “Multi-modal” describes models that can process data from a variety of inputs, such as text, video, image, or audio, and can produce outputs in a similar array of forms. Unlike other LLMs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4, Gemini is natively multimodal, meaning it was trained on diverse inputs.

Last year also brought significant breakthroughs in AI chip capabilities. Nvidia reached a technological milestone in May 2023 when it unveiled the world’s first 100-terabyte GPU memory system in its new semiconductor model DGX GH200. The new chip is a significant advancement compared to the company’s earlier models, particularly the DGX A100, and it provides over 500 times more memory to the GPU shared memory programming model compared to a single DGX A100 320 GB system. These advanced chips open the potential for faster, more efficient AI models and computing systems — advances to look forward to in 2024.

Finally, AI continued to revolutionize an increasingly diverse number of scientific fields. In 2023, AI models from Google DeepMind made significant breakthroughs in both material science, predicting “ingredients and properties of another 2.2 million materials,” and meteorology, with its GraphCast model. Earlier in the year, Huawei published a similar model called Pangu-Weather. These breakthroughs could reveal new materials and methods to construct novel batteries, superconductors, and catalysts.

### 2024 THE YEAR AHEAD

_Ten Developments to Monitor in 2024_

#### 01
#### How effectively can high-level global AI governance talks translate into tangible impact?

Global AI governance talks resulted in significant high-level commitments in 2023, from the Bletchley Declaration signed at the United Kingdom’s AI Safety Summit to the Hiroshima AI Process set in motion under the Japanese G7 presidency last year. How will such commitments translate into actionable policies and enforceable regulations in 2024?

#### 02
#### How will third-party red teaming work in practice?

Biden’s AI executive order requires that AI developers evaluate their frontier models through a practice called red teaming, in which adversarial attacks are simulated to assess the vulnerabilities and robustness of a model. Developers will be required to report their findings to the government before the model is released to the public. How will third-party red teaming work in practice, and will the government be able to use the findings to keep up with the growing size and capabilities of LLMs?

#### 03
#### Can Congress pass comprehensive AI legislation?

President Biden’s AI executive order was a step toward U.S. AI regulation, but its efficacy depends upon Congress passing legislation and budget allowances. Will AI regulation remain a largely bipartisan issue, and how quickly can it pass through Congress given the expected tough timing with 2024 elections?

#### 04
#### How will the Italian G7 presidency meaningfully build upon the Hiroshima AI Process this year?

In 2023, the Japanese presidency put AI on the G7 agenda and committed to coordinating AI governance efforts under the Hiroshima AI Process. Interoperability between governance frameworks is a daunting yet essential task for avoiding a fragmented global AI landscape, and one that Italy has signaled it will pursue this year. What steps will the Italian presidency take to move the Hiroshima AI Process forward and to deliver the G7’s commitment to harmonized AI regulation?

#### 05
#### Will scaling up AI continue to deliver new capability breakthroughs?

The substantial scaling up of LLMs produced dramatic performance improvements in 2023. Will improvements continue to grow exponentially this year, or will developers hit diminishing returns without making fundamental architectural improvements?

#### 06
#### Will the DOD’s Replicator initiative get the funding it needs?

The DOD’s Replicator initiative is a comprehensive effort by the United States to accelerate the delivery of AI-enabled autonomous systems to warfighters at speed and scale. The program aims to address strategic competition with China, a subject of critical importance. What will happen if the DOD receives only token funding?

#### 07
#### How will U.S. and allied export controls affect China’s progress in AI and semiconductors?

Huawei’s late August release of the Mate60 Pro raised serious questions about the enforceability of U.S. and allied export controls and their impact on China’s technological trajectory. Can the United States and its allies effectively enforce export restrictions, and how might this influence China’s technological trajectory in 2024?

#### 08
#### How will AI impact major elections this year?

2024 is the biggest election year in history, with over half of the world’s population heading to the polls. It will be the first year that political parties must define their stance regarding AI, and some voters may see AI regulation featured as a question on their ballots. Both would have been almost unthinkable only a year ago. It will also be the first election cycle in which AI will likely play a significant role in election campaigning, interference, and spreading disinformation. How might the world’s busiest election year fare with AI in the mix?

#### 09
#### Will open-source AI models continue to be available at leading-edge performance?

The open- versus closed-source debate largely revolves around whether AI development should prioritize transparency, collaboration, and accessibility (open source) or proprietary control, safety, competitive advantage, and intellectual property protection (closed source). Who will emerge victorious in this debate and what implications could this have for AI’s future development, regulation, and democratization?

#### 10
#### Will tech giants continue to dominate AI development?

The AI landscape is currently dominated by a handful of key players like Google, OpenAI, and Meta. Will tech giants continue to dominate AI development and market returns in 2024, or will we see a more diversified landscape with winners emerging in niche industries?
