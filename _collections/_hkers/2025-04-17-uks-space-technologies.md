These technologies are interconnected and mutually reinforcing, forming a cohesive framework for the UK’s ambitions in space power and national security.

_Basics of Space Technology: Small Satellite Design and Manufacture, Core Components and Functions_

The UK rightly maintains a focus on small satellites and their launch capabilities because they offer a cost-effective, agile platform for enhancing telecommunications, Earth observation and national security capabilities, driving technological innovation and economic growth in the burgeoning space sector.

Small satellites have evolved and are designed to perform specific functions within constrained sizes, ranging from femtosatellites (0.001–0.01 kg) to minisatellites (100–180 kg). They are equipped with miniaturised sensors, processors and communication systems to fulfil specialised roles such as Earth observation or communication. A critical enabler of their functionality is the integration of advanced materials, miniaturisation technologies and efficient power systems.

Small satellites in particular rely on advanced miniaturisation technologies to pack essential components into their compact frames. These are:

- __Payload:__ This is the functional heart of the satellite, including sensors, cameras and communication systems. For example, optical sensors are used for Earth observation, while radio frequency receivers can support signals intelligence.

  - Earth observation payloads: The UK excels in the development of advanced hyperspectral imaging sensors and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, enabling satellites to capture high-resolution, multi-spectrum data for applications in agriculture, climate monitoring and disaster response. Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) is renowned for developing hyperspectral imaging sensors and compact payloads for Earth observation, used in missions such as the Disaster Monitoring Constellation.

  - Communications payloads: UK firms such as Inmarsat and OneWeb are leading in designing next-generation communication payloads, incorporating phased array antennas and software-defined radio technologies to deliver flexible, high-bandwidth connectivity across the globe.

- __Power systems:__ Most small satellites are equipped with solar panels to generate power and rechargeable batteries for energy storage. Advances in efficient solar cell technologies allow even small satellites to operate robustly in space.

  - While many small satellites operate passively, some include propulsion systems for orbit adjustments. Many UK-designed small satellites use electric propulsion technologies such as ion thrusters and Hall-effect thrusters, which offer high efficiency and precise manoeuvrability for tasks such as orbital adjustments and station-keeping while consuming minimal fuel.

  - UK companies such as Nammo UK are developing innovative green monopropellant propulsion systems that use environmentally friendly fuels, such as LMP-103S, to provide reliable thrust for small satellites while reducing toxic by-products and storage hazards associated with traditional propellants.

- __Onboard processing and communication:__ Miniaturised processors and antennas enable satellites to perform data collection, processing and transmission autonomously, reducing dependence on ground stations.

  - AAC Clyde Space develops onboard communication subsystems, including high-performance radios and transceivers, designed for reliable data downlink in smallsat constellations.

  - Archangel Lightworks is an innovative UK company focusing on free-space optical communications, enabling high-speed data transfer between satellites and ground stations using laser-based systems.


### Applications of Small Satellites in National Security

### Space Launch Systems

It may seem obvious, but a satellite that remains tethered to terra has little purpose. Satellites need to be in space; thus, the success of small satellites depends on reliable and adaptable launch systems. The UK’s renewed focus on launch capability – highlighted by the development of spaceports such as Spaceport Cornwall and SaxaVord Spaceport – signals its commitment to ensuring sovereign access to space.

_Innovations in Launch Technology_

Launch vehicles designed for small satellites are smaller, lighter and more efficient than traditional rockets. Notable features include:

- __Dedicated launches:__ Unlike shared launches, dedicated systems transport small payloads to specific orbits, offering greater control and responsiveness.

- __Reusable components:__ As demonstrated by SpaceX and adopted by UK-based start-ups, innovations such as reusable rocket stages significantly reduce costs.

- __Eco-friendly propulsion:__ Orbex, for example, a UK-based orbital launch services company, is developing rockets using bio-propane, a low-carbon alternative to traditional rocket fuels.

_Applications in National Security_

Launch systems enable rapid deployment of small satellites, which is crucial during crises or conflicts. For instance, if adversaries disrupt satellite constellations, quick-response launch capabilities can replace or augment assets, maintaining critical services such as communication and ISR.

_Sustainable Space Practices_

With 40,500 pieces of debris (greater than 10 cm) and 130 million pieces of debris (between 1 mm and 1 cm) in orbit, sustainable space practices are no longer optional – they are imperative. The UK has already taken a global leadership role in promoting responsible space stewardship through policy, innovation and international diplomacy, and it should be noted that the UK led the work for UN General Assembly Resolution 75/36, “Reducing Space Threats Through Norms, Rules and Principles of Responsible Behaviours”.

_Technical Approaches to Sustainability_

- __Space debris mitigation:__ Companies such as 3S Northumbria are designing sustainable space solutions, including space surveillance systems and supporting software, grounded in the principles of a circular economy for space, with space situational awareness at the heart of the work.

- __Design for disposal:__ New satellites are engineered for planned decommissioning. Lightweight materials and controlled de-orbiting mechanisms ensure minimal long-term impact.

- __Propellant-free manoeuvring:__ Emerging technologies use solar sails or other innovative means for orbit adjustments without traditional propulsion.

_National Security Implications_

Sustainability of space is not only about ethics; it should be a national security priority. Space debris directly threatens active satellites, including those essential to defence and intelligence. The UK’s emphasis on sustainability ensures its assets are protected while setting a global standard for responsible space exploration.
