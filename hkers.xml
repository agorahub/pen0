The war has not diminished Russia’s core economic and security interests in the region, but it has had some impact on its military readiness there in the short term, especially in terms of ground capabilities, if not at sea or in the air. In addition, there are some preliminary indications that sanctions and export controls may diminish Russia’s ability to deploy precision munitions to the Arctic to a degree. At the same time, Russia’s use of hybrid tactics in the region seems to be increasing in both frequency and severity. The United States and NATO will need to take stock of these developments in a region they have not historically prioritized as they begin to implement their new, respective strategies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 disrupted the European security architecture and altered the risk calculus underpinning the foreign and security policies of its neighbors. This shift was also stark in the Arctic, which had for a long time been hailed by many as a highly cooperative and unusually peaceful part of international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Arctic Council ceased to function when its seven members other than Russia suspended participation in official meetings. This left the region without its main intergovernmental venue for cooperation. Next, in search of security, Finland and Sweden requested to join NATO. Furthermore, Russian “hybrid tactics” — to now possibly also include the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, as well as that of undersea cables in the Arctic and near-Arctic, among other activities — have raised the level of alarm in NATO members like Norway and nearby states. Finally, the increased security concerns are also seen in newly released policy documents, such as the U.S. Arctic Strategy. The first U.S. government-wide Arctic strategy since 2013, it states that Russia’s war in Ukraine has “raised geopolitical tensions in the Arctic” and created “new risks of unintended conflict,” a point that is also emphasized in the U.S. National Security Strategy (NSS). However, the Arctic has not been a top security priority for the United States or NATO in recent years, and there are weighty arguments that this might be a problem that needs addressing as tensions rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s military interests in the Arctic are ostensibly defensive: to defend its second-strike, sea-based nuclear deterrent capability operating out of the Kola Peninsula; to defend the homeland; and to protect its regional economic endeavors, especially oil and gas megaprojects like the Yamal LNG and Vostok Oil ventures, and the Northern Sea Route (NSR), which Russia views ambitiously as a future global trade thoroughfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also has offensive goals. First, it seeks to use the Arctic as a staging ground for power projection, especially into the North Atlantic Ocean via the Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) Gap. Second, it may consider hybrid activities to intimidate or coerce European Arctic countries. Finally, in an unlikely — but not unthinkable — wider NATO-Russia conflict, having escalated to a war, one can imagine Moscow risking a limited incursion into Norway or Finland in a bid to protect its critical nuclear assets in the Kola Peninsula by creating greater defensive depth through, for example, the establishment of more western anti-access/area denial system systems at relatively easily defended sites west of its border. This scenario resembles Cold War-era fears. A perhaps more likely modern conflict scenario could involve long-range precision strikes of high-value assets like the Norwegian or future Finnish F-35s and the infrastructure needed to keep them flying. In addition, in accordance with basic military-strategic theory, one can also assume that command and control sites, radars, and important bases supporting key naval capabilities or anti-submarine warfare planes such as P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft would be attractive targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has not materially changed these Russian core interests. The need to protect the nuclear second-strike capability based out of the Kola Peninsula will be undiminished, and even heightened, in the likely event that Finland joins NATO. If and when this scenario plays out, critical military installations such as the Northern Fleet’s strategic submarine base at Gadzhiyevo will be less than 200 kilometers away from the border of a new NATO country. As a response, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu, after meeting with President Putin, stated in December that new military bases would be established: “Given NATO’s desire to build up military potential near the Russian borders, as well as to expand the North Atlantic Alliance at the expense of Finland and Sweden, retaliatory measures are required to create an appropriate grouping of troops in Northwest Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, despite the diminishing European market for Russian Arctic fossil fuels — and the evaporation of foreign investment in such projects from sanctioning countries — there is little evidence Putin intends to reduce his economic ambitions in the region: an NSR development plan including roughly 1.8 trillion rubles in funding was approved in August 2022, and work continues on oil megaprojects. It is reasonable to assume Russia will maintain its regional military posture commensurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper first reviews Russia’s prewar Arctic military assets before investigating which of these assets have been used and potentially lost in the invasion of Ukraine. Taking stock of these potential war damages, as well as the impact of sanctions on Russia’s defense industry, the third section assesses the relative attractiveness of hybrid tactics for Russia to assert itself in the Arctic. The fourth section analyzes some implications of these findings for NATO and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;command-and-unit-structures&quot;&gt;Command and Unit Structures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command is Russia’s Arctic military command and the core of its regional presence. The fleet’s area of responsibility includes the western and central Arctic. The Eastern Military District commander is responsible for the eastern Arctic, all the way to the Bering Strait. The fleet’s primary responsibilities are to defend and ensure beneficial operational conditions for Russia’s second-strike nuclear capability, as well as the homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Fleet has five operational formations, each with several tactical units. Most are housed on the Kola Peninsula. These include three naval formations, the 45th Air and Air-Defense Forces Army (AADA), and the 14th Army Corps. The naval formations include the Northern Fleet’s Submarine Command and fleet, as well as the Kola Flotilla, which contains most naval assets intended for Arctic-specific use, including some main surface combatants. There is also the 61st Naval Infantry Brigade, which includes some reconnaissance forces among other assets, as well as special forces units in Polyarny. The 45th ADAA was formed in December 2015. Its precise tactical makeup is not publicly available, but reports indicate that it bears responsibility for anti-missile systems and distributed units on bases in the central Russian Arctic. The two main units of the 14th Army Corps are the 200th Motorized Rifle Brigade and the 80th Arctic Motor Rifle Brigade, in addition to other smaller subordinated units working on tasks like command and control, among other roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Russian Arctic Military Installations.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Fleet also oversees the restoration of dozens of Soviet-era military installations that now dot the Russian Arctic, east of the Kola Peninsula. These installations vary in size and the degree to which they host troops and kinetic capabilities. Roughly, there are 3 major bases, around 13 airfields, 10 radar stations, 20 border outposts, and 10 emergency rescue stations. Finally, there are military assets that are not based in the Arctic but should be considered in the analysis. For example, two Russian airborne assault units are assigned to help protect the Kola Peninsula: the 76th Guards Air Assault Division and the 98th Guards Airborne Division. These divisions, as well as the 106th Guards Airborne Division, have trained for Arctic-specific missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-capabilities&quot;&gt;Specific Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submarines.&lt;/strong&gt; The Northern Fleet hosts eight of Russia’s ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) of the Delta IV and Borei classes. Their purpose is strategic: to maintain Russia’s retaliatory nuclear strike capability. The Delta IV submarines are each capable of carrying 16 SS-N-23 Sineva submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), as well as, reportedly, the SS-N-15 Starfish anti-submarine missile. The Borei submarines can carry 16 SS-N-32 Bulava SLBMs. The Northern Fleet is believed to have approximately 16 other active combat submarines, including six nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) of the Akula, Victor III, and Sierra II classes, five nuclear-powered guided missile submarines (SSGNs) of the Severodvinsk and Oscar I/II classes, and five Kilo-class diesel submarines (SSKs). The upgraded Akula-class submarine will reportedly be armed with some variant of the Kalibr missile. The Sevorodvinsk submarines carry two variants of the Kalibr — both the land attack missile (SS-N-30) and the anti-ship variant (SS-N-27). The formidable submarine is also armed with the SS-N-26 Strobile anti-ship cruise missile, i.e. the P-800 Oniks. The Oscar II-class is armed with SS-N-19 Shipwreck and SS-N-16 Stallion anti-ship missiles. Victor III and Sierra II submarines are armed with the SS-N-21 Sampson cruise missile. One could also argue that the Northern Fleet has access to auxiliary submarines for noncombat functions, ostensibly including undersea research, but most likely also including covert tasks, even though these officially report to the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research. Not all submarines are made equal, of course — some are outdated and noisy, and some have limited combat potential. Overall, anti-submarine warfare experts consider Russia’s subsurface fleet to be formidable. The deployments of the Kalibr are especially notable: it is a long-range precision missile at the high end of Russian capabilities. It gives the Russian Navy the ability to hit distant targets — between 1,500 and 2,500 kilometers — from platforms that can be difficult to detect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surface Combatants.&lt;/strong&gt; As of 2019, the Northern Fleet officially had 37 surface vessels, including 10 operational large vessels and the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier (the only one in The Russian Navy), although the latter was damaged in a pair of accidents a few years earlier and will likely not re-enter service before 2024. The Admiral Kuznetsov is armed with the SS-N-19 Shipwreck anti-ship missile and the SA-N-9 Gauntlet surface-to-air missile, among other systems. The fleet’s flagship vessel is the Kirov-class nuclear-powered missile cruiser Pyotr Velikiy. Kirov-class cruisers also use the Shipwreck and Gauntlet systems, as well as other surface-to-air missiles. A second Kirov-class cruiser has been under reconstruction since 1999; although The Russian Navy claims it will be back in service in 2023, work on this vessel has repeatedly been extended. There is a Slava-class guided missile destroyer (the Marshal Ustinov), which uses the SS-N-12 Sandbox anti-ship missile, as well as having surface-to-air missile systems. There are also two Gorshkov-class frigates, which are armed with both the land-attack and anti-ship variants of the Kalibr, as well as Oniks missiles, two Udaloy I/II-class anti-submarine warfare ships, and one Sovremenny-class destroyer that uses the SS-N-22 Sunburn anti-ship missile. The fleet has an estimated eight landing ships (Ropucha- and Ivan Gren-class). It also has two ice-class ships of its own and can call on 46 “civilian” icebreakers. It also has a small fleet of minesweepers. Finally, there are ice-reinforced auxiliary vessels, such as a logistics ship, a tanker, and two research vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground Capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia’s major ground capabilities are limited in the Arctic. According to a prewar study from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), the three brigades had between them approximately 50 tanks, 450 armored personnel carriers, and an indeterminate number of “cross-country vehicles and multipurpose articulated tracker carriers,” as well as various artillery systems and some attack aviation capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air Combat Capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; According to RUSI, Russia has four major air units in the Arctic. At Severomorsk, there are two: the 279th Shipborne Fighter Regiment with approximately 24 Su-33 fighter jets and the 100th Shipborne Fighter Regiment with 24 MiG-29K fighters. At Monchegorsk, the 98th Mixed Air Regiment has an estimated 12 MIG-31BMs, 12 Su-24Ms, and an indeterminate number of Su-24MR reconnaissance crafts. Finally, there is an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) regiment at Severomorsk, as well as maritime patrol aircraft like the Il-38N and Tu-42. Before the war in Ukraine, there were also an estimated 30 bombers under the command of the Northern Fleet, many of which were housed at Olenya under the control of the 40th Mixed Aviation Regiment. In addition, there are occasionally Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers forward deployed across the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missile Capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; The distinction between defensive and offensive missile capabilities is not sharp in practice, and the below capabilities can be used for multiple ends. The Northern Fleet operates a “hardened, Arctic-capable, multilayered air defence and sea denial system,” which is part of the Bastion defense concept. In addition to the key air defense capabilities on the Kola Peninsula, including the S-400 system, there are three Arctic bases most critical to this concept: Nagurskoye, on Alexandra Land Island, Franz Josef Land; Temp base on the main New Siberian Island in the east; and Rogachevo base on Novaya Zemlya. Each has some combination of long-range S-300 and S-400 anti-air systems, medium-range P-800 Oniks anti-ship missiles, short-range Pantsir and Tor M2DT surface-to-air systems, and coastal defense K-300P Bastion-P and 4K51 Rubezh systems. In addition, the S-400 is deployed at Severodvinsk, and the S-300 system is deployed at Olengorsk on the Kola Peninsula and to the Tiksi air base in the eastern Russian Arctic. The latter system, it should be noted, has been reported as being used in a surface-to-surface offensive role in Ukraine. As the S-400 is a similar system, it may be similarly versatile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xK6z2qQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Northern Fleet reportedly “holds 20 percent of Russia’s precision strike capability in peacetime, and possesses the launch platforms of all its air-launched Kinzhal [hypersonic] ballistic missiles.” Kinzhal missiles have reportedly been fielded on bombers and MiG-31s. In addition, the Admiral Gorshkov frigate and Sevorodvinsk submarines have tested the hypersonic Tsirkon anti-ship missile in the Arctic at least eight times since fall 2020. Both the Sevorodvinsk- and Oscar II-class submarines are able to launch both the Tsirkon and the supersonic P-800 Oniks cruise missiles, making them “increasingly lethal at long ranges.” The fleet’s largest ammunition storage for submarine-launched ballistic missiles is at Okolnaya Bay on the Kola Peninsula. The result of all this is a dense missile defense network with offensive potential in the western Russian Arctic that becomes more open as one moves eastward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain Awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia claims to have deployed its Rezonans-N radar system to bases on Novaya Zemlya, the Kanin Nos Peninsula, and at Indiga. These systems may be notable in that, according to some Russian sources, they can detect hypersonic missiles and stealth planes and possess supposedly advanced over-the-horizon capabilities. It is not clear, however, if the indication and warning they can provide against stealth aircraft can come early enough to ensure interception. There is reportedly also a “dual-use air-surveillance radar station” on Graham Bell Island. Sopka-2 radar systems are deployed at the Temp, Nagurskoye, and Rogachevo air bases. Finally, Russia has some space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities pertaining to the Arctic, including Meridian-M communications satellites and an Arktika-M weather satellite for navigation support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Warfare.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia reportedly maintains electronic, or electromagnetic, warfare centers at Severomorsk, Kamchatka, and Primorsky Krai. Analysts note that the systems likely deployed to centers such as these could facilitate anti-submarine warfare and interfere with maritime communications. Russia’s doctrine emphasizes electronic warfare. It may be used to jam Western communications, radars, and datalinks for one of several purposes: to confuse an adversary, to blind them, and/or to lengthen or interrupt adversary decisionmaking processes and kill chains. If used well, this can provide a battlefield advantage. This capability can also be used maliciously in peacetime, as Section Two describes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-two-impact-of-the-war-on-russias-conventional-capacity&quot;&gt;Section Two: Impact of the War on Russia’s Conventional Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;direct-impact-of-the-war&quot;&gt;Direct Impact of the War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing credible unclassified reports of destroyed Russian assets or decimated units is challenging, but a few assertions can be made. First, relatively early in the war, some Northern Fleet naval assets were sent to the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, or Ukraine itself, including the Marshal Ustinov — which is now one of only two remaining Slava-class cruisers after the sinking of the Moskva in April — and three large landing ships. Second, the three large landing ships carry an estimated 30 tanks and 1,000 troops between them but, even though they took off from a Northern Fleet port originally, they made a port call in Kaliningrad before sailing south to the Black Sea. It is therefore highly likely that some assets the ships were transporting were not from the Northern Fleet. Third, no Northern Fleet warships or submarines have been reported destroyed in the conflict. The Marshal Ustinov left the region during the summer, and at least one of the landing ships has been seen in the Arctic as recently as September. Fourth, there are no credible reports that any of the Northern Fleet air combat capabilities identified above have been destroyed in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, and most notably, there are reports that several Russian Arctic units have been deteriorated, especially ground forces. The 200th Motorized Rifle Brigade and 61st Independent Naval Brigade have been involved in the fighting in Ukraine, as has the 80th Arctic Motor Rifle Brigade and the 76th Guards Air Assault Division. What is more, there is reason to believe one battalion tactical group of the 200th has been not only involved in the fighting but effectively wiped out: an adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky asserted in March that 645 of the group’s 648 soldiers had been killed. Eighteen of the tanks confirmed to be destroyed in Ukraine are T-80BVMs, a type that the 200th had at its disposal. Finally, a Northern Fleet unit of marines that reportedly “trained for reconnaissance and sabotage operations behind enemy lines,” the Special Underwater Forces unit 69068, may have been effectively eliminated. However, as the war goes on, credible independent verification of the war losses is difficult to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;impact-of-sanctions&quot;&gt;Impact of Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to direct attrition due to the war, it may be useful to consider the impact of sanctions and export controls on the Russian economy and defense industry, both with respect to forthcoming capabilities destined for the Northern Fleet and to advanced systems in the Arctic that depend on foreign technology and may be in demand for Russia’s war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the first question, there is a sizeable list of assets that the Northern Fleet is supposed to receive in the coming years. Another Borei-class SSBN is due to join the fleet, as are the following submarines: three Akula SSNs undergoing refits to, it is believed, give them the ability to launch Kalibr cruise missiles; three more Severodvinsk SSGNs; and an indeterminate number of next-generation Lada-class SSKs. The ambitious Lider-class destroyer project had intended to build eight of these advanced vessels, which would have been split between the Northern and Pacific Fleets. Even before the recent round of sanctions, the project was beset by difficulties and a reported lack of funding. Its current status is not clear based on public information. As noted earlier, the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is currently undergoing repairs. A second diesel-electric icebreaker may be forthcoming for the navy, as well as one new Arctic patrol icebreaker. Two more Rezonans-N complexes are expected to be constructed by the end of the year. Russia also intends to launch three more Arktika-M satellites by 2025 and has claimed that two early-warning Voronezh systems will be operational by the end of 2022. Finally, it has been speculated that Russia’s long-rumored, nuclear-enabled, autonomous torpedo drone, the Poseidon, could be based on the Kola Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall state of the Russian economy and the impact of sanctions may affect its ability to field these and other capabilities on schedule. Sanctions have already significantly impacted the Russian economy. Some analysts predict it will not return to prewar levels until the end of the decade, and the threat of secondary sanctions will only increase over time. Some sectors have been significantly affected and, as of June 2022, imports from sanctioning countries had “collapsed by 50 percent or more in comparison” to the same period in 2021. Russia has already fallen into a recession. At the same time, there are signs of resilience. Russia has shown some ability to source goods from some non-sanctioning countries, and India and China have increased oil purchases, compensating so far for the loss of the EU market. Furthermore, the Russian defense sector is relatively less dependent on imports than those of other countries. Moscow is willing to prop up the sector and divert funding to it at the expense of others, such as healthcare or education. Experts have estimated that defense spending in the first seven months of 2022 exceeded the same period in 2021 by about $20 billion, and the defense procurement budget may have increased by roughly 45 percent over the past year. Overall, there is some consensus among experts that the Russian defense industry will still be able to produce less sophisticated weapons systems, but that high-tech capabilities will be an issue, both because of export controls and because of brain drain. Despite attempts to increase its self-sufficiency in the last eight years, Russia has relied on foreign technology in its defense, especially when it comes to high-end computer chips. For example, as of June, Russia’s main armored vehicle manufacturer had ceased tank production for lack of foreign parts; tank variants like the T-90 rely on Western electronics. Even parts of Russia’s military tactical communications system reportedly depend on Western components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few specific findings are relevant to the Arctic theater. First, Ukrainian forces found five U.S.-made chips in a captured defense Pantsir air defense system, which has been deployed to the major bases on Alexandra Land Island, the New Siberian Islands, and Novaya Zemlya, as well as on the Kola Peninsula; it was intended for use to support the 80th Arctic Motor Rifle Brigade. Second, some precision-guided munitions also depend on Western components, including the Kalibr, Iskander-M, Kh-101, and 9M727 cruise missiles, as well as the 9M549 guided artillery rocket. The Kalibr is used — or intended for use — by the Northern Fleet’s Gorshkov frigates, Severodvinsk SSGNs, and Akula-class SSBNs, and was intended to be used by the Lider-class destroyers as well, if that project ever comes to fruition. As of September, Ukrainian intelligence estimated Russia had used 55 percent of its stockpile of guided missiles, though these are dated numbers associated with very high uncertainty. The Ukrainians similarly assessed that Russia was down to only four dozen hypersonic missiles. Russia has in recent years often tested such missiles in the Arctic theater. It also had plans to deploy some, such as the Kinzhal missile, to the region. Without advanced and imported chips, Russia may not be able to fully build these stocks back up — though recent reporting from the New York Times indicates that the country may have some resilience in this regard. Nonetheless, given the likely shortfall at present, there may be a competition between missile needs in the Arctic and in other theaters like Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, Russia’s conventional land forces in the Kola Peninsula, including naval infantry and possibly special forces, are today depleted and substantially weakened. Russia’s ability to successfully conduct a rapid conventional ground incursion toward its western neighbors in the Arctic is in the short term even more minimal than before the war. Its ability to do so in the medium and long term will depend on its ability to recruit new conscripts and train them for Arctic operations. There is also reason to think that the same issues relating to “low morale, poor execution of combined arms, subpar training, deficient logistics, [and] corruption” may bedevil Russian forces in the Arctic, as they have in Ukraine — though one should not underestimate Russia’s potential to learn from its failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the toll from the Ukraine war is not necessarily reflected in the other service branches in the Russian Arctic. The naval components of Russia’s Northern Fleet, particularly its strategic submarine fleet, continue to give Moscow a credible second-strike capability. One can also assume the same situation to be the case for Russia’s strategic air force, as well as intelligence collection capabilities, special purpose ships and submarines, and other parts of the Kremlin’s nonconventional power-projecting apparatus. As such, Russia’s ability to threaten the West in the Arctic with naval and air assets in the short term has been affected less. Its ability to do so in the medium to long term will depend on how sanctions impact its defense industry: given the assets the Northern Fleet was due to receive that are in varying stages of development or construction, it may be supposed that the fleet will be somewhat less formidable in 5–10 years than it might otherwise have been if sanctions had never been imposed. One potential weakness is that precision munitions will be harder to come by for the entire Russian armed forces, to include some Arctic capabilities. This may make certain offensive measures against Arctic NATO allies less attractive, such as the scenario discussed in section one, wherein Russia may consider, in the early stages of a wider NATO-Russia conflict, using such munitions to strike at key targets inside of Norway, Finland, or Sweden. Russia’s Arctic air defense capacity is hardly affected at all, except to the extent that the Pantsir system will become more difficult to replace. While Russia has other advanced air defense systems in the region, such as the S-300 and S-400, those are intended for long-range protection; the Pantsir is used for short-range base defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-three-hybrid-threats-in-the-arctic&quot;&gt;Section Three: Hybrid Threats in the Arctic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the conventional thus accounted for, it must be further noted that other capacities, such as Russia’s propaganda machine and “hybrid” tools of influence, also continue to work at full steam. Observations from NATO’s northern flank suggest that campaigns where hybrid instruments play a role might be on the rise in Russia’s northern neighborhood. However, as the term “hybrid” often lacks a clear definition, this conceptual aspect needs to be addressed before laying out some empirical observations of Russia’s increasing use of a hybrid playbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hybrid warfare” is a problematic term to define in a scientifically satisfactory way. It is often used interchangeably with “hybrid threats” or “hybrid influence,” essentially being expressions for composite hostile activities in what has been described as the “gray” or “blurred zone” between peace and war. While it is hard to settle on a precise, commonly accepted definition, the connotation is nonetheless frequently used by policymakers, military experts, or in media when describing “gray zone events,” or threats, that do not fit the traditional dichotomy of peace and war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the Multinational Capability Development Campaign’s “Countering Hybrid warfare” project, in this publication we apply the term hybrid warfare to mean “the synchronized use of multiple instruments of power tailored to specific vulnerabilities across the full spectrum of societal functions to achieve synergistic effects.” These instruments of power are also designed to be under the threshold of what is viewed as an act of war, hence not triggering an Article 5 response from NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When scrutinizing recent events in the northern parts of NATO’s area of responsibility, Norway stands out as a country where multiple hybrid threats seem to have been observed recently. During fall 2022, numerous unidentified drones have flown over or around important parts of Norwegian communication infrastructure, airports, or military facilities. In addition to these installations, large drones have also overflown oil and gas facilities, such as Kårstø, a crucial facility for processing and transporting gas out of Norway. The flying of drones also included illegal photographing on Svalbard, the remote Norwegian archipelago between the North Pole and the northernmost tip of mainland Norway. Suspicious activity also led to the arrest of no less than seven Russian citizens in a short amount of time in fall 2022 for illegal photographing across the country. At about the same time, the Norwegian Police Security Service arrested and charged an illegal Russian spy who was working under a fake identity as a researcher at University of Tromsø, Northern Norway. Of other earlier suspicious activities that have been reported by media, the Russian Orthodox Church’s friendship visit from the Russian border city of Severomorsk to Kirkenes deserves to be mentioned. As the priests arrived on the visit, they displayed an unusual interest in studying the Kirkenes’ water supply. However, the desired on-site study trip was canceled by the mayor of Kirkenes after discreet advice from the Chief of Police in Finnmark. Similarly, substantial parts of eastern Finnmark in northern Norway have for several years been affected by the jamming of GPS signals. This electronic interference originates from Russia and is affecting various nonmilitary activities in Finnmark, such as civilian aviation. As of today, Norwegian Aviation Authorities report that “the jamming from Russia is more frequent than ever before.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7CKVhg9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Pipelines on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: “Oil Pipelines on the Norwegian Continental Shelf,” Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, September 9, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in the Baltic sea, Norway’s gas pipelines to Europe have been recognized as a “prime target for sabotage.” This realization comes after years of reporting on consistent suspicious Russian activities in the Norwegian littorals, where key ports and subsurface cables and pipelines have drawn a lot of interest from Russian “research” or fishing vessels. Worrying reports, such as the cutting of a subsurface fiber-optic cable stretching from mainland Norway to Svalbard, as well as the damage of fiber-optic submarine cables near the Faroe and Shetland Islands, point to a pattern fitting the traits of hybrid warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Russia’s conventionally weakened capacity in the Arctic, and the high tensions between Russia and the West, it is reasonable that such hybrid campaigns might turn out to be the preferred Russian tool to target communities in its Arctic neighborhood in the future, at least for the short and medium term. While it is debated what the true intention of the abovementioned campaigns might be, the actual mapping of potential targets is one hypothesis, while other likely intentions might simply be the desire to create uncertainty and fear in the population or to signal Russian dissatisfaction with Western policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-four-implications-for-nato-and-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Section Four: Implications for NATO and the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Russia’s capacity to project power into the North Atlantic Ocean from the Arctic seems unchanged. This was the only threat pertaining to the Arctic, or High North, that NATO allies agreed to put in the new 2022 Strategic Concept, and so it is especially notable. It was not specifically discussed in the U.S. Arctic strategy, but it is the United States, along with Canada, whose naval assets would need to cross the North Atlantic Ocean to reinforce European allies in an Article 5 contingent. Allied plans to invest in surveillance capabilities, especially radars in the area of the GIUK gap, will help mitigate this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia’s relative incapacity to threaten a conventional military land incursion into European Arctic allies will be welcome news to the Biden administration, whose recent strategic documents do not indicate a high prioritization of the region in terms of defense. Most notably, the NSS lists the Arctic last in its overview of regional policies. The strategy is cautious about promising U.S. presence in the Arctic, saying it will only be exercised “as required, while reducing risk and preventing unnecessary escalation.” The U.S. National Defense Strategy mentions the Arctic fleetingly and is also cautious: “U.S. activities and posture in the Arctic should be calibrated, as the Department preserves its focus on the Indo-Pacific region.” Its emphasis is on stability, homeland defense, and maritime domain awareness, and there is no language in the Arctic section about deterring threats to Arctic allies and partners. This language does appear in the U.S. Arctic strategy, which states, “We will deter threats to the U.S. homeland and our allies by enhancing the capabilities required to defend our interests in the Arctic.” The document promises needed investments in domain awareness capabilities and icebreakers. Still, it also emphasizes avoiding escalation and notably states that it “may be possible to resume cooperation under certain conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the three documents seem to indicate an administration that will take regional threats in the Arctic seriously and will likely continue to show occasional presence and participate in exercises, but that will prefer cautious actions so as not to threaten the relative stability of the region. Doing so allows the administration to focus on other geopolitical priorities, like China, and not excessively complicate other regional priorities like climate change research and economic development. One finding from this paper that may therefore be of interest is that there are indirect, light-touch ways to enhance Arctic security: effective imposition of the sanctions regime concerning dual-use computer chips seems to be one way to diminish the conventional Russian threat in the Arctic that does not involve deploying U.S. military assets or personnel to the region. If the administration is seeking to balance the need to protect allies and partners with a desire to not overly militarize the region, this could be notable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, given the state of Russia’s conventional armed forces, Russian aggression toward Arctic European states may continue to lean heavily on hybrid tools. There have been encouraging signs of a Western response to this, such as Norway’s deployment of the Home Guard to protect critical infrastructure, and NATO allies’ assistance to help them do so via increased allied ship patrols in the North Sea. Norway also recently adopted its annual Flotex naval exercise to include a component focused on protecting oil and gas installations. Even the U.S. Arctic strategy recognizes the challenge, promising to focus on “building the resilience of critical infrastructure,” including against cyberattacks. This is a welcome recognition from the Biden administration of Russia’s penchant for using hybrid tactics in the High North — however, the administration may not yet have fully recognized that this tool is likely becoming more attractive to Russia in the Arctic, relative to conventional force. NATO allies like Norway, and future members like Sweden and Finland, may need to further impress this probability on the United States and other allies at the NATO level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is probably too early to give an accurate and comprehensive estimate of the future Russian warfighting capability in the Arctic, given the impact of the Ukraine war. It would be prudent, however, given what is known and what is coming to light, to revisit assumptions that guided prewar analysis, campaign modeling, and wargaming concerning the region. Indeed, U.S. military doctrine is explicit that assumptions should be constantly reconsidered in light of new information, and NATO doctrine echoes this. As NATO’s new Supreme Allied Commander Europe starts crafting the alliance’s new regional defense plans, there is an opportunity to consider some of these preliminary findings in High North scenarios. In the meantime, the old saying, sometimes attributed to Winston Churchill, that “Russia is never as strong as she looks; Russia is never as weak as she looks,” might be a prudent approach for the West with respect to its security and defense planning in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

As demonstrated by the case of Argentina, these close ties can benefit Chinese party-state actors going overseas by providing material state support — but can also become a liability by engendering skepticism among host countries and potential business partners over Chinese firms’ motivations. To explore these elements of the CCP Inc. ecosystem, this report examines two recent projects in China-Argentina space collaboration: first, the construction of China’s first international deep space ground station, and second, the dynamics of Chinese business collaboration with Argentine satellite technology start-up Satellogic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does China’s expanding space sector reveal about the country’s state capitalist economic system? This case study examines the CCP Inc. ecosystem of Chinese regulators, state-owned and private financiers, technology companies, and military entities key to becoming what Chinese leader Xi Jinping has termed a “great space power” (航天强国). China’s ambitions include developing world-leading space technology and systems, pursuing deep space exploration, and shaping the norms of global space governance. Toward these goals, China continues to enhance bilateral and multilateral cooperation with a growing number of countries. This case study examines how the complex ecosystem of Chinese party-state actors serves — and sometimes limits — Beijing’s space ambitions by investigating Chinese commercial and state-backed investments in Argentina’s space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s broader state capitalist system has evolved since Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) extended its control over both China’s private sector and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), while SOEs merged and consolidated into bigger entities with more expansive networks of subsidiaries, as part of an initiative to improve efficiency. State investment has taken on increased importance as a method for steering Chinese companies toward the pursuit of strategic objectives. These developments have created a complex ecosystem in which state-owned and private-owned Chinese companies are subject to state and party influence via an array of financial, ownership, and personnel conduits — but are still able and encouraged to pursue commercial aims within the bounds of the CCP’s strategic interests. This new paradigm of Chinese state capitalism is known as the “CCP Inc.” system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, CCP Inc. benefits Chinese companies; rather than go it alone, Chinese companies enter new markets and projects as part of an ecosystem of government and commercial entities in pursuit of common economic goals. Yet CCP Inc. can also be a liability for Chinese firms, engendering skepticism overseas about their motivations; close connections with CCP and state actors make it difficult for individual Chinese firms to distance themselves fully from broader party-state aims when approaching potential partners abroad. The effectiveness of CCP Inc. varies substantially by country and industry, depending on China’s diplomatic relationships with the target state and the degree of CCP control over the sector in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study explores how CCP Inc. has enabled China’s space sector to grow its international footprint through key projects in Argentina. From the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System to successful explorations on the far side of the moon and a mission to Mars, China’s national space capabilities have improved dramatically in the past three decades. Along with eye-catching interplanetary missions, China’s space sector recently underwent a less publicized structural transformation. In 2014, China opened the sector to private investment, expanding the role of commercial actors in the country’s space program. However, as this case study shows, the core of the sector remains closely linked to state agencies, SOEs, and military organizations — even more so than other industries examined in this series of CCP Inc. case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s space cooperation with Argentina illustrates how state, military, and commercial entities have broadened the overseas footprint of China’s space sector. Space cooperation between China and Argentina began through diplomatic channels. In the early 2010s, amid deepening bilateral relations, Argentina agreed to host China’s first international deep space ground station: the Estación de Espacio Lejano (Spanish for “deep space station,” referred to in this report as the “Espacio Lejano Station”), which was constructed by Chinese SOEs that had track records of working on People’s Liberation Army (PLA) contracts and is now managed by a Chinese military-linked state entity. As commercialization of the Chinese space sector has grown, commercial deals by private Chinese companies have also become an increasingly important part of China-Argentina space cooperation, particularly through deals focused on satellite technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study proceeds in three parts. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to China’s space sector and China-Argentina space cooperation. Chaper 2 examines the development of the Espacio Lejano Station, which remains a source of controversy within Argentina and internationally due to its links to the PLA. Finally, Chapter 3 explores the role of Chinese commercial space engagement in Argentina through examination of deals between Chinese companies and Argentine satellite imagery start-up Satellogic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-space-program-and-china-argentina-space-cooperation&quot;&gt;China’s Space Program and China-Argentina Space Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the more established industrial sectors examined in previous CCP Inc. case studies on mining, financial services, energy, and telecommunications, China’s space industry is relatively new and quickly evolving. It is also tightly interwoven with government and military bodies to a degree unparalleled by market economies, even those with substantial state involvement in the space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this deep integration, one need only look at the composition of China’s space sector today, which consists of three primary groups of actors (see Figure 1): the state-owned “national team” of government agencies and major SOEs; entities linked to the PLA; and — since 2014, when deregulation opened the door for private investments — a burgeoning set of commercial actors who are interlinked with the other two groups. As a window into CCP Inc., the evolution of China’s space industry over the past decade demonstrates how China’s state capitalism can simultaneously open more opportunities for commercial development while maintaining tight state control over private sector involvement in a strategic industry. The important role of the PLA in this sector also impacts how international companies and governments engage with China’s space industry, as demonstrated by the projects in Argentina detailed in the second and third sections of this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sAe29Bk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Three Overlapping Actors in China’s Space Sector: State, Commercial, and Military.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources cited throughout this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “national team” of China’s space industry is the well-established core of the national space program, compared to the country’s relatively new commercial space sector. It consists of government agencies, central SOEs, and hundreds of SOE subsidiaries. Two state agencies, the State Administration for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND) and the China National Space Administration (CNSA), oversee China’s space industry as civilian administrators, while the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) plays a key role in aerospace research and technology development. Marc Julienne, head of China research at the French Institute of International Relations, has described SASTIND as the “nerve center” for the country’s space program; as the name suggests, the organization is focused on defense. According to China’s State Council, it was established to serve “the needs of national defense, military forces, national economy, and military-related organizations,” in addition to the “coordination of communications and cooperation on the use of nuclear power and space activities with countries and international organizations.” Under the purview of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Council (SASAC), two SOEs — China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), each with hundreds of subsidiaries — form the core of the government’s aerospace research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and defense sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Chinese regulators lifted numerous restrictions on private investment in the space sector, resulting in a growing number of start-ups and new, mixed-ownership SOE subsidiaries with private investors, which together comprise China’s commercial space sector. At the time, the State Council released a statement commonly referred to as “Document 60,” which encouraged “private capital to participate in the construction of national civil space infrastructure” such as satellite launch and operations, as well as ground systems. Later, the State Council’s 2016 white paper on space highlighted efforts “to increase the level of commercialization of the space industry” by encouraging the participation of “nongovernmental capital and other social sectors” in space-related activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with this government backing for commercialization, new players joined a preexisting ecosystem of government and military-linked entities. According to the white paper, “commercialization” does not require that funding come solely from nongovernment actors — rather, “commercial” entities can be funded by both government and nongovernment actors. Some analysts estimate that the number of commercial space sector companies is over 200 but note that this figure would vary based on how broadly “commercial” is defined. Commercial companies often share close institutional and personnel connections with the “national team.” For example, a 2019 study by the Institute for Defense Analyses found that many founders and executives of Chinese start-ups in the field were previously affiliated with CAS or with the major SOEs in the aerospace sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military plays a direct role in China’s space program through the PLA Strategic Support Force (PLASSF), which assumed responsibility for space activities after its creation in 2015. A product of China’s military reorganization that year, the PLASSF was tasked with integrating the space domain more closely into China’s military operations. According to analysts of China’s space industry, the PLA — via the Strategic Support Force — works closely with SASTIND to coordinate R&amp;amp;D and manufacturing to support China’s space activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-growing-space-presence-goals-and-strategy&quot;&gt;China’s Growing Space Presence: Goals and Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leadership has specified national space goals in authoritative documents: quinquennial State Council white papers on space; publications by top state agencies such as SASTIND and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC); and the national Five-Year Plan, a development agenda passed every five years by China’s legislative body, the National People’s Congress. The State Council’s most recent space strategy white paper, published in January 2022, emphasizes China’s continued goal to “strengthen its space presence in an all-round manner” in order to boost self-reliance in science and technology, secure its role in space governance, and enhance its national security (among other objectives). Internationally, the space sector features in China’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) through the Spatial Information Corridor, an initiative designed to provide comprehensive spatial information services (such as BeiDou satellite navigation) for countries along the BRI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, China’s defense white paper officially elevated space to a military domain. The paper argued that “outer space has become a commanding height in international strategic competition” now that the “first signs of weaponization of outer space have appeared.” These publications affirm that Chinese leaders view space as a pivotal playing field in geopolitical competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leadership encourages the array of state-owned, military-linked, and commercial actors in China’s space industry to support the state’s space goals. For example, Document 60 (which allowed for private capital in China’s space sector) promotes investment in specific space technologies such as satellites, remote-sensing data, and ground stations, specifying key areas that commercial actors are expected to support. While many countries have military aims in space, as the U.S. Space Force demonstrates, defense analysts characterize China’s military as more actively involved in the national space sector compared even to that of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the state actively encourages cooperation between the military and civilian pillars of China’s space industry. A prominent aspect of China’s ational defense and military strategy is its pursuit of military-civil fusion (MCF), which involves “infrastructure and resource sharing” and “joint innovation of military and civilian science and technology,” as Xi stated in a 2018 meeting of the Military-Civil Fusion Development Committee. China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, published in 2021, emphasizes the need to deepen military-civil cooperation in space in the context of national aerospace technology development. In 2018, SASTIND outlined the requirements to apply for projects with the organization, specifying that applications should “strengthen civilian-military coordination on relevant scientific research plans [民口、军队有关科研计划的协调], [and] make proper links with defense industry scientific research projects already implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government’s broader efforts to promote and enhance dual-use technologies aim to encourage innovation and investment that supports both China’s economic goals and military development. While companies are not legally required to support these MCF goals for space, MCF still plays a key role in China’s space strategy and commercial space development because the state incentivizes companies to develop new technologies that support China’s military abilities in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s space white papers also make clear that its leaders see the sector as a source of innovation in the country’s technology economy and view China’s growing space presence as a way to “promote high-quality economic and social development.” For example, these white papers have repeatedly stated that China aims to promote the application of its satellites and space technology in order to “serve national security and national economic and social development.” These goals contributed to decisions to allow commercial space ventures, boosting the sector’s rapid growth in recent years. Since 2014, new satellite and rocket companies have emerged with greater frequency, generating high-value jobs and enabling China to make inroads into overseas markets for Chinese space technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By allowing private investment in China’s space sector, Chinese authorities have claimed a bigger stake in the fast-growing global commercial space economy. According to measurements by the Space Foundation, the global space economy had grown to a value of $469 billion by mid-2022, primarily due to increasing revenue in the commercial space sector. This marked a 54 percent growth in industry value over the past decade. While the United States is still by far the largest government spender on its space industry, China is now beginning to lead in other metrics, such as number of orbital launches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To extend the reach of its space technology and tap into the growing global space economy, China has pursued global partnerships while building up its domestic space industry — which, in turn, informs understanding of China’s international space engagement. The remainder of this case study dives into China’s space engagement with Argentina, where close diplomatic ties and opportune financial circumstances facilitated frequent collaboration on both commercial and state-linked projects. The mix of state, military, and commercial entities characteristic of China’s domestic space industry is reflected in Argentina, where official diplomatic engagement and PLA actors played central roles in creating space industry ties, followed by commercial deals to deepen space cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two-decades-of-steadily-deepening-china-argentina-relations&quot;&gt;Two Decades of Steadily Deepening China-Argentina Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina’s diplomatic and economic relationship with China has deepened significantly over the past two decades. China has become one of Argentina’s major creditors, offering a source of investment during Argentina’s perennial financing challenges. According to the Inter-American Dialogue lending database, China’s policy banks have lent $17 billion for infrastructure development projects in the country since 2007 — more than China has lent to any other Latin American nation — and commercial banks have entered into 36 agreements in the country. Though China’s overseas spending and lending dropped off during the Covid-19 pandemic, in 2022 China pledged support for Argentina to join the BRICS bloc of emerging market powers (made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), indicating both a continued appreciation for Argentina’s economic importance and a geopolitical interest in expanding the bloc’s footprint in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A steady trend of friendly relations across different Argentine and Chinese administrations deepened government-to-government ties throughout the past two decades. Current and former presidents Alberto Fernández (2019–present), Mauricio Macri (2015–19), and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007–15) desired varying degrees of closeness to China, but ultimately each advanced the bilateral relationship during their terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dfamsgH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;President Xi has enjoyed friendly relations with the past three Argentine governments, led by Alberto Fernández (left), Mauricio Macri (center), and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (right).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strong diplomatic relationship created a foundation for Chinese investment in and cooperation with Argentina across a variety of industries, including mining, agriculture, telecommunications, and energy. In addition to these more traditional areas for Chinese investment, space has become an important component of bilateral ties. Over the past two decades, the two countries signed multiple space cooperation frameworks, China offered technical and financial support for Argentine satellites, and — most critically — Argentina granted China land to construct its first deep space ground station on foreign soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china-argentina-space-cooperation&quot;&gt;China-Argentina Space Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s efforts to strengthen international space cooperation with Argentina can be traced back to the early 2000s. In 2004, Chinese president Hu Jintao and Argentine president Néstor Kirchner (the husband of later president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner) signed a joint agreement on the “Cooperation of Peaceful Utilization of Outer Space Technology” during Hu’s visit to Argentina. During this trip, Hu also visited a space satellite manufacturing company, Investigación Aplicada S.E (INVAP), which was responsible for creating and launching satellites for Argentina’s newly formed national telecommunications company, Empresa Argentina de Soluciones Satelitales Sociedad Anónima AR-SAT (ARSAT). In 2005, China offered to sell Argentina a full satellite-launching system at a great discount in exchange for ARSAT stock — a deal that, if it had gone through, would have created a Chinese ownership stake in the state telecommunications company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HkrWPuH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Argentine president Néstor Kirchner and Chinese president Hu Jintao during Hu’s 2004 visit to Argentina.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While INVAP ultimately chose a different contractor and ARSAT remained Argentine-owned, China’s engagement in Argentina’s space sector broadened and deepened in the years after Hu’s visit. Both state- and privately owned Chinese firms have supported Argentine satellite development through financing and technology provision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since those initial steps toward space cooperation, China and Argentina have worked together on multiple space projects led by a combination of state, military, and commercial actors. Notable ongoing projects include the China-Argentina Radio Telescope (CART) in Argentina’s San Juan Province and the recently announced partnership between Argentine satellite manufacturer Ascentio Technologies S.A. (Ascentio) and Chinese commercial space firm Emposat (航天驭星, previously known as Satelliteherd) to develop a ground station. The CART is an example of international engagement led by the national team of China’s space sector; the project was officially approved by China’s Ministry of Science and Technology as one of the country’s major international collaborative science projects in 2010, with the Argentine provincial government of San Juan administering its construction. The Ascentio-Emposat deal, on the other hand, demonstrates how the commercial wing of China’s space industry drives growth in international engagement while still working closely with the national team. Emposat, a private company founded in 2016, frequently partners with Chinese government- and PLA-affiliated organizations such as CAS and SOEs such as CASC to pursue projects abroad. In addition to a new partnership with Argentina’s Ascentio, Emposat has contributed to the construction of ground stations across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the proliferation of China-Argentina space industry business deals and infrastructure projects, the current state of space ties is outlined in official agreements between the two nations. Under the current administration of President Fernández, China and Argentina frequently include deepening space cooperation as an important part of the overall bilateral relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable achievement of China-Argentina space engagement is the construction of a PLA-run deep space ground station in Argentina’s Neuquén Province. Both the unique position of the Espacio Lejano Station in China’s space strategy and the group of CCP Inc. actors responsible for its construction merit a closer look. The following chapter examines in detail the circumstances behind the space station agreement and how different Chinese actors worked together to construct and run the secretive site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-first-international-deep-space-ground-station&quot;&gt;China’s First International Deep Space Ground Station&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ambition to become a “great space power” involves expanding its “deep space network” (深空网路), a series of large radio dishes that provide a better understanding of deep space; more frequent telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&amp;amp;C) capabilities; reliable communication with launched satellites; and more precise navigation. Deep space ground stations are thus critical to realizing Beijing’s goals of furthering lunar and planetary exploration and increasing TT&amp;amp;C coverage. Operation of ground stations and satellite TT&amp;amp;C functions fall under the purview of the PLASSF Space Systems Department, the military organization responsible for the bulk of the PLA’s space operations, including control over the four satellite launching sites and three TT&amp;amp;C sites that provide the infrastructure for China’s growing ambitions in space. In 2020, China launched more satellites into space than any other country, and it completed more than 60 orbital launches in 2022 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;background-on-ttc-deep-space-ground-stations-and-cltc&quot;&gt;Background on TT&amp;amp;C, Deep Space Ground Stations, and CLTC&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TT&amp;amp;C systems facilitate communication between satellites and ground stations by downlinking transport data from a satellite — such as its location and overall performance — and allowing ground stations to give commands to satellites. The frequency of communication with satellites depends on the number and placement of ground stations, since connections can only be established when the satellite or space object is within range (or view) of the ground station. As a deep space ground station, the Espacio Lejano Station also allows China to have more frequent communication with and access to deep space objects, which have longer orbital periods and come into view less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Established in 1986, China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General (CLTC, 中国卫星发射测控系统部) is the main organization in charge of China’s TT&amp;amp;C and space launch sectors. Verifying the chain of command above CLTC is not simple; examining public corporate registration documents, external analytical accounts, and CLTC’s subsidiary structure produces an uncertain picture. Online company registry databases show CLTC registered as a company wholly owned by the Commission for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND, 国防科工委), a civilian ministry of the State Council that was discontinued in 2008 and succeeded by SASTIND. That ownership structure would make CLTC a civilian body, but other indicators suggest that it is in fact a subordinate body of the PLASSF’s Space Systems Department. China’s satellite launch centers fall under the jurisdiction of the PLASSF’s Space Systems Department and are also subordinate to CLTC. Additionally, CLTC’s current and past leadership has included members of the PLASSF, with the same individual serving simultaneously as the chief of staff of the PLA General Armaments Department and the chairman of CLTC. Overseas space companies have, at times, stopped working with CLTC in preference for commercial TT&amp;amp;C companies due to CLTC’s ties to the PLA. As this evidence suggests, CLTC is intimately involved with both China’s civilian space program and the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China currently has three deep space ground stations: two within China (in Kashgar and Jiamusi) and one abroad (in Neuquén Province, Argentina). The Espacio Lejano Station thus fills a temporal gap in China’s global coverage. Adding a ground station on the other side of the globe allows China to improve the frequency of communication with its satellites. Since ground stations most easily communicate with satellites when they pass overhead, the additional deep space ground station in Neuquén gives China more continued access to them. Notably, ground stations can also gather information from other satellites that pass overhead, not just Chinese ones. Thus, more deep space ground stations allow for faster and more frequent gathering of data, which can help China understand the behavior of other countries’ satellites. The station’s official purpose is to expand deep space capabilities, with Chinese statements about it emphasizing its role in lunar exploration. For example, the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA) says the Espacio Lejano Station played an important role in the 2019 Chang’e 4 mission to the far side of the moon. China’s space presence in Latin America extends beyond Argentina: CLTC constructed facilities for the Santiago Satellite Station, a ground station with three TT&amp;amp;C antennas in Chile’s Andes mountains. The station is operated by Swedish Space Corporation, which leased operation of two of the antennas to CLTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement for the construction of the Espacio Lejano Station was reached in 2012, during a period of particularly strong diplomatic and economic ties between the Chinese government and the administration of Argentina’s president Christina Fernández de Kirchner. The agreement codified that the Espacio Lejano Station would be managed by CLTC and constructed with the aid of Chinese SOE contractors, subsidiaries of China Communications Construction Company. Operational since 2018, the station quickly became a flashpoint within Argentina and internationally — particularly within the United States. As discussed later in this chapter, the opacity around the station’s construction, political controversy around the terms of the deal, and CLTC’s links to the PLA have fueled suspicion about China’s intentions for the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Espacio Lejano Station reveals two observations about the PLA’s position in the CCP Inc. ecosystem. The station agreement and its construction were facilitated by Chinese officials, state-owned construction firms, and a PLA-linked organization (CLTC) that now runs the station. Through one lens, this could be seen as a case study of how the PLA rallied other parts of the CCP Inc. ecosystem to advance China’s military interests abroad. At the same time, throughout the process, these military ties featured as key reasons for pushback against the Espacio Lejano Station and setbacks to Chinese investments in Argentina’s space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-espacio-lejano-station-agreement&quot;&gt;The Espacio Lejano Station Agreement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework agreement for the Espacio Lejano Station was signed in 2012 by Argentina’s civil space agency, Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE), CLTC, and the province of Neuquén, where the station is located. These parties then signed a further follow-on agreement in 2014. The deal granted China 50 years of full sovereignty and tax exemption over a 200-hectare (500-acre) plot of land to build the deep space ground station. China received the right to construct, establish, and operate ground tracking and data collection without needing to specify what the technology and data would be used for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contract guaranteed CONAE the use of 10 percent of the deep space ground station’s operating time per year. However, the agreement does little to limit China’s operations there. Rather, it specifies that Argentina cannot “interfere [with] or interrupt the normal activities carried out under the Cooperation Agreement” and that if Argentina were to take any decisions that might interfere with China’s activities, it must inform China in advance and explore alternative options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total cost of the station to China remains unclear. According to records captured by the AidData database, CLTC spent $50 million (USD) in state funding for the project in 2012, while Chinese media reports in 2015 say that CLTC was expected to invest $300 million. The framework agreement also includes language about the Chinese government paying Chinese workers according to their own labor laws, suggesting that the $50 million could refer to the amount the Chinese government — via CLTC — paid its own contractors and workers for the station. Though the framework agreement was first reached in 2012, the deal did not pass Argentina’s Congress until 2015. The station has been operational since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial Espacio Lejano Station agreement was reached during the administration of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007–2015), a period marked by both financial troubles for Argentina and a deepening of the Sino-Argentine partnership. In 2014, China and Argentina upgraded their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership and dramatically deepened their economic ties. China and Argentina signed dozens of commercial deals, China offered an $11.4 billion (RMB 70 billion) currency swap between the two countries’ central banks, and Argentina benefited from Chinese loans to upgrade its infrastructure. The bilateral relationship has since remained relatively strong, grounded in these expanding economic ties. In 2015, a new center-right government led by President Mauricio Macri initially raised concerns about transparency in dealings with China. He pledged to review — and potentially cancel — major bilateral deals with China as he attempted to deepen relations with the United States and Europe. However, Macri ultimately maintained the arc of continued alignment with China, meeting with Xi five times and accepting further financing and business deals during his tenure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Espacio Lejano Station spotlights the linkages that often exist between high-level state goals (China’s aim of becoming a leading international space power) and individual projects overseas. Examining how the station was constructed and how it is now run underlines the benefit of being able to draw on party-state support for strategic projects. As the following section shows, CLTC relied on Chinese construction companies with a track record of working with the PLA to build the Espacio Lejano Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;construction-and-management-in-neuquén&quot;&gt;Construction and Management in Neuquén&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per the diplomatic agreement between the Chinese and Argentine governments, Chinese state-owned construction companies built the station. According to Chinese government press releases and media reports about the station, two subsidiaries of China Communications Construction Company (CCCC, 中国交通建设公司) — China Harbor Engineering Company (中国港湾工程有限责任公司) and China Communications Fourth Highway Engineering Bureau (中交第四公路工程局有限公司) — led this process, alongside an Argentine construction firm, Electroingeniería S.A. CCCC is a majority state-owned and publicly traded company that has played a significant role in China’s island-building in the South China Sea and the military stations upon them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tSLCYwy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Actors Involved in Constructing and Managing the Espacio Lejano Station.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources cited throughout this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few details regarding the selection process for contractors at the Espacio Lejano Station are publicly available, but the involvement of these firms follows a precedent set in the South China Sea and elsewhere, in which the PLA uses select construction companies to work on sensitive projects. With construction now finished, the Espacio Lejano Station is managed by CLTC and one of its sub-entities, Xi’an Satellite Control Center (XSCC), both of which are subordinate to the PLASSF Space Systems Department. After China’s military reforms in December 2015, the Space Systems Department acquired authority over China’s space-related test bases, which include XSCC and satellite-launch bases. XSCC, which is China’s largest satellite control center and the main center for China’s TT&amp;amp;C operations, was designated by CLTC as the entity responsible for “construction and operating matters” at the Espacio Lejano Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cooperation between CLTC and the two construction SOEs — China Harbour Engineering Company and China Communications Fourth Highway Engineering Bureau — shows how connectivity with Chinese firms enables the PLA to execute international projects. Just as CCCC constructed islands in the South China Sea that proved crucial to PLA expansion there, PLA-affiliated CLTC relied on military-industrial support companies to construct the Espacio Lejano Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLTC’s role has been central to accusations that the station is essentially run by the military, drawing criticism from the local community and analysts abroad. The PLA’s involvement and the secrecy that Espacio Lejano Station is able to maintain — in no small part due to the fact that China relied on its own contractors — has attracted suspicion from local residents, Argentine legislators, and international analysts alike. This suspicion reveals the drawbacks of military involvement in the CCP Inc. ecosystem and foreshadows hurdles for China’s space industry — and its bid for a greater international presence — going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;suspicions-surrounding-ccp-inc-at-the-espacio-lejano-station&quot;&gt;Suspicions Surrounding CCP Inc. at the Espacio Lejano Station&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emanating from both local and international observers, concerns about the potential uses of the Espacio Lejano Station stem from a combination of factors: secrecy around the space station’s operations, the dual-use nature of the space technology involved, the PLA’s presence, and the impression that Argentine interests are not being served in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the local level, residents living nearby have expressed concerns that the station is a military base disguised as a research facility. Horacio Quiroga, former mayor of Neuquén (the capital city of Neuquén Province), told media that, in his view, the installation is “practically Chinese territory.” On the national level, legislators have rallied for further oversight, including through a 2019 effort by Argentina’s Senate majority leader to create an independent monitor for the station. Internationally, analysts highlight that the technology used at ground stations like Espacio Lejano is inherently dual-use and could serve military or civilian purposes. U.S. military officials have also voiced concerns about the potential military use of the Espacio Lejano Station to target the space activities of the United States or its partners and spy on U.S. satellites. Any internet search in either English or Spanish turns up pages of results revealing concerns among these various actors about the Chinese military’s involvement in Neuquén.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While none of these concerns prevented the Espacio Lejano Station from being built, they did affect its reputation. Still, the Argentine government stood by its agreement and sought to reassure the public. In 2016, Argentine minister of foreign affairs Susana Malcorra and her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, signed an additional protocol affirming that the station would be used only for peaceful purposes. Argentina’s current ambassador to Beijing, Sabino Vaca Narvaja, maintained that “China shares all information about its space program with Argentina” after the commander of the U.S. Southern Command questioned the potential military uses of the station. In a 2021 meeting with China’s vice minister of industry and information technology, Zhang Kejian, who oversees the CNSA, Vaca Narvaja underlined Argentina’s interest in deepening space cooperation and highlighted the Espacio Lejano Station’s aid to China’s Chang’e 5 lunar probe as a positive example of bilateral cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nl3cFeP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Satellite imagery of the Espacio Lejano Station shows an unusually large number of administrative and housing facilities on site given the size of the ground station itself. The vast amount of leased land around it — far more than the deep space station currently uses — could also indicate intentions to expand the installation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, reassurances from Argentine and Chinese officials have not changed the facts that the station remains operated by a PLA-linked administrator, official oversight by Argentina is limited, and the installation continues to house dual-use technology. Because CLTC drew on Chinese SOEs to construct the station, Argentine companies’ involvement has been limited. The degree of concern that has emerged about the Espacio Lejano Station clearly demonstrates a critical liability of the CCP Inc. ecosystem: suspicions regarding the intentions of the Chinese state and, in this case, the Chinese military are extended to each of the country’s international projects, particularly those that involve strategic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Espacio Lejano Station shows that close ties to the military can be a reputational liability for China’s overseas space efforts, but also that the close connections between the civilian and military sides of China’s space industry benefit the PLA by enabling it to conduct international space projects. As previous CCP Inc. case studies in this series underline, engagements with one Chinese firm or institution are not carried out in a vacuum. CCP Inc. involves a web of relationships between parent and subsidiary companies, financiers, and Chinese officials, as well as personnel ties to the CCP. Within the space industry, the PLA is part of that list of relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the following section shows, the close integration of the PLA into the space sector is often a factor in whether overseas investors and firms choose to engage with China’s commercial space projects. In the space industry, profit-seeking Chinese companies frequently work with the PLA or toward MCF aims. In Argentina, business dealings between Argentine satellite start-up Satellogic and multiple Chinese space companies reveal that the latter may act in pursuit of commercial aims but are never too far removed from the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;satellogic-and-chinas-commercial-space-sector&quot;&gt;Satellogic and China’s Commercial Space Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentine start-up Satellogic’s engagement with Chinese companies illustrates how China’s burgeoning commercial space sector is increasingly involved in international investments. Founded in 2010, Satellogic has grown into a pioneering satellite technology company valued at over $200 million on the Nasdaq, as of writing. Satellogic describes itself as operating in the commercial “NewSpace” sector, where it focuses on building more cost-effective satellites. The company’s vertically integrated structure — in which it manufactures the various parts of its satellites rather than relying on vendors — enables it to roll out new technology quickly. The company has major ambitions: it plans to launch enough satellites into orbit to provide global, high-resolution imagery, refreshed every day — a mission Satellogic says will “completely reshape the business model” for imagery data. Satellogic’s latest launch, in January 2023, brought its total fleet up to 30 operational satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellogic has collaborated with state-owned Chinese firms for technology support, received major investments from a private Chinese company, and entered the Chinese market through a contract with a Chinese data science company to provide imaging services. Though Satellogic’s partnerships were commercial, they still brought the Argentine start-up into the fold of the state-linked Chinese space sector. After the company set its sights on going public in the United States and gained new U.S. investors, it appears to have pivoted away from its Chinese partners, naming SpaceX as its preferred launch partner and divesting itself of any ownership stake by Chinese investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellogics-history-of-partnership-with-chinese-firms&quot;&gt;Satellogic’s History of Partnership with Chinese Firms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellogic partnered with China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC, 中国长城工业集团) to launch its early satellites. CGWIC is a fully owned subsidiary of the SOE CASC, but it describes itself as a “commercial” organization because it is authorized by the Chinese government to provide commercial launch services. It also partners with military-affiliated organizations in China’s space industry, including CLTC. In 2015, 2016, and 2017, CGWIC signed initial agreements that helped Satellogic launch satellites into low-earth orbit and, in 2019, signed a multiple launch agreement (MLA) for 90 Satellogic spacecraft. In November 2020, CGWIC sent 10 Satellogic satellites into orbit in the company’s largest launch to date, bringing the total number of CGWIC-launched satellites to 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LEzXCE6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;A Chinese rocket carrying China’s remote sensing satellites is launched from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Gansu Province. China has ramped up its rocket launches in recent years and completed more than 60 orbital launches in 2022 alone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese investors also played a critical role in providing seed money and follow-on investments that facilitated Satellogic’s development. Privately owned Chinese technology and media conglomerate Tencent participated in three rounds of investment in Satellogic prior to the company’s listing on the Nasdaq. Subsequently, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Satellogic (referred to in the filings as “Nettar Group Inc.”) raised a total of $40 million from Tencent, via its subsidiary Columbia River Investment Limited, over six rounds of funding between January 2015 and September 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ahead of Tencent’s 2019 investment, Satellogic signed a $38 million agreement with Chinese data science company Zhong Ke Guang Qi Space Information Technology Company (known in English as ABDAS, 中科光启空间信息技术有限公司) — a private company that was set up with the support of CAS — to provide ABDAS with imaging services of China’s Henan Province. This agreement granted ABDAS exclusive access to a fleet of satellites and decisionmaking authority over which specific regions to observe when passing over Henan, giving it the observational data needed to support crop yield and evaluate compliance with environmental regulations. This was Satellogic’s first deal for a “dedicated satellite constellation,” wherein customers can lease ownership over satellites when they pass over a specified geographic region. While none of the companies involved ever confirmed a link between Satellogic’s agreement with ABDAS and Tencent’s investment, industry analysts have speculated that Satellogic’s relationship with Tencent may have helped it navigate its partnership with ABDAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellogic’s cooperation with ABDAS also extended to a project of close interest to the CCP. At the end of 2019, ABDAS and People’s Data Company (人民数据管理有限公司) jointly launched the People’s Nebula (人民星云) project, which combines satellite services with big data to “build a comprehensive aerospace data product sharing service platform” that will, in turn, facilitate China’s access to satellite imagery and data. The People’s Data Company was established under the CCP’s top newspaper, the People’s Daily, which expanded its services to include data management and cloud computing. Satellogic provided Henan Province complete control over its dedicated satellite constellation, but (if successfully completed) the People’s Nebula project will allow China to access satellite-provided data on a far larger scale, without needing to utilize a third party such as Satellogic. This project requires building and launching a series of satellites, the first of which (Renmin-1) was developed by Satellogic and launched by CGWIC. While few details are publicly available about this deal, Satellogic’s existing relationship with Tencent and CGWIC likely contributed to Satellogic developing the first satellite for People’s Nebula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese collaboration with Satellogic demonstrates the various forms of international engagement China’s space industry takes. CGWIC, a company plugged into the state-owned and military-linked facets of this sector, played a key role in helping Satellogic get its first satellites off the ground and renewed its partnership with a multiple launch agreement in 2019. Tencent offered a source of private financing and, in addition to investing in Satellogic, has invested in other foreign space companies, including the U.S. firms Planetary Resources and Moon Express. Satellogic’s agreement with ABDAS was mutually beneficial, providing utility to Henan Province and enabling Argentina to access the Chinese market — and likely led to Satellogic’s involvement in the People’s Nebula project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellogics-shift-away-from-ccp-inc&quot;&gt;Satellogic’s Shift Away from CCP Inc.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this track record of collaboration, Satellogic began shifting toward new U.S. partners in the past few years. In July 2021, Satellogic announced its plans to go public in the United States via a merger with CF Acquisition Corp. V (CFV), a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald, a U.S. financial services firm. Cantor Fitzgerald also provided $58 million to a $100 million private investment fund, to which Liberty Strategic Capital (a private equity firm founded by former secretary of the treasury Steve Mnuchin) invested an additional $150 million in January 2022. Shortly after Satellogic received this influx of U.S. capital, it announced a MLA with SpaceX for its next 68 satellites, with CEO Emiliano Kargieman describing SpaceX as the company’s “preferred partner for rideshare missions” in “2023 and beyond,” signaling a move away from CGWIC in future launches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the 2019 CGWIC MLA promised to launch 90 spacecraft, Satellogic may still be working with the Chinese SOE — but any such collaboration is no longer highlighted on either Satellogic’s or CGWIC’s websites. Additionally, Satellogic dropped Tencent as an investor after its final investment in September 2019. Documents filed with the SEC in March 2021 ahead of the company’s public listing show that Satellogic repurchased shares and promissory notes from Tencent subsidiary Columbia River Investment Limited (CRIL) in exchange for owing CRIL a $40 million loan — removing any ownership stake for Tencent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3oakyhr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Timeline of Satellogic’s Partnerships.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources cited throughout this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift away from Chinese partners is further explained in Satellogic’s F-1 SEC filing (a form required from foreign companies before listing in the United States). The document notes that a significant part of Satellogic’s growth plan relies on demand from international defense and intelligence customers and that “continued concerns regarding prior ownership of a minority interest in the Company’s shares by a Chinese entity and its minor operations in China could impact the Company’s ability to win bids from or enter into customer contracts with certain government agencies or commercial customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the key role of Chinese partners in — quite literally — getting Satellogic’s early operations off the ground, the company seems to have decided that the business risks of continued collaboration with Chinese companies outweigh the opportunities. This decision underlines the particularly sensitive nature of the space industry. Though Satellogic is a commercial company, it is still cognizant that defense and intelligence uses of space technology remain central. Even Tencent, a private company, was impacted by Satellogic’s (or new U.S. investors’) concerns about links to the Chinese state. Satellogic repurchased Tencent’s shares to eliminate the Chinese company’s ownership stake despite its significant involvement in early funding rounds. The complex relationships and unclear boundaries in China’s space industry may dissuade international cooperation as it becomes more difficult for Chinese companies to separate themselves from the PLA and international perceptions of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-constrained-commercial-space&quot;&gt;China’s Constrained Commercial Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business agreements and investments between Satellogic and various Chinese companies show a very different side of China’s space industry compared to the state-led construction of the Espacio Lejano Station. Satellogic is a commercial actor working with Chinese space companies via business partnerships rather than bilateral agreements. It provides insight into how commercial deals factor into China’s pursuit of space industry goals and how private actors such as Tencent are investing in the sector. From looking at Satellogic and China’s domestic space sector more broadly, it is clear that private investors and Chinese businesses are able to pursue commercial ends only within a closely state-aligned environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Tencent, for example. Tencent’s investment in Satellogic could be seen as a purely private sector agreement. But at home, it has been working on its own launch of a space program in collaboration with the Chinese National Astronomical Observatories. Since China opened its space sector to private investment, the sector has seen an influx of startups and commercial space companies, but almost all of these still have a degree of state involvement and are typically only 30–50 percent privately funded. Many of the most successful “commercial” enterprises are subsidiaries of CASC or CASIC — or receive a combination of funding from large government organizations such as SASTIND or provincial governments in addition to private investment. Companies often tailor their innovation targets to support national security goals or government priorities to guarantee more funding. Meanwhile, the CCP supports these companies because they can innovate faster and work on projects that government organizations would not necessarily pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s model for the commercial space industry emphasizes the importance of centering private space ventures around national defense and security goals. In this context, the definition of “commercial” is limited, since most Chinese commercial space companies have elements of state ownership, connections to the PLA, or both. For example, it is common for prominent commercial space companies — such as ExPace, a commercial launch-vehicle maker and subsidiary of CASIC that provides services to foreign customers — to have leadership and personnel overlap with that of state-owned entities. ExPace’s chairman is simultaneously the deputy director of CASIC; in his dual roles, he has tasked the company with advancing successful commercial launch constellations and spaceplanes, which ultimately helps advance China’s broader space goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening China’s space sector to private investment has brought increased sources of funding while retaining the level of state alignment needed to ensure that this private financing continues to serve China’s strategic interests. Meanwhile, government funding in the sector allows the CCP to steer the growing array of commercial and state-owned companies. This creates a business ecosystem that is very tightly controlled — even more so than other industries in China. While financing, personnel ties, ownership structures, and political initiatives create conduits of party-state influence that are recognizable across the CCP Inc. state capitalist system, the strategic nature of the space industry and its close links to the military differentiate it from more traditional economic sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the CCP Inc. ecosystem of China’s space sector, teasing out the motivations of individual actors is extremely difficult. Tracing the connective tissue between the parts and the whole — such as links between certain companies, state administrators, and the PLA — is feasible. But discerning to what degree Chinese space companies are motivated by profits and growth opportunities, versus dedication to state policy, is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of China-Argentina space cooperation mirrors themes evident in China’s other international engagements. Through CCP Inc., Chinese firms benefit when their commercial objectives align with state and military goals, enabling access to preferential state financing, diplomatic support, and other advantages. Additionally, by integrating state and business aims, the CCP Inc. system enhances party- state influence over commercial decisionmaking while maintaining ambiguity regarding whether certain corporate decisions are ultimately motivated by business or by state strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this complex ecosystem comes with risks for Chinese firms and, in turn, party-state goals overseas. Concern in host countries about Huawei compromising fifth-generation (5G) network security — or State Grid using its role in national electric grids to gain political leverage — centers on the strong connections between the Chinese party-state and China’s global commercial reach. The Espacio Lejano Station has been plagued by international and domestic political debates criticizing its opacity and military management. In the past few years, Argentine firm Satellogic has eschewed Chinese partnerships in favor of new investments and business deals in the United States, almost certainly due to Satellogic’s assessment that links to China could undermine its ability to compete for international defense and intelligence contracts. CCP Inc. can be a liability for Chinese actors seeking to engage commercially overseas. As the global space industry grows and China aims to build its position within it through further international partnerships, Chinese actors will face a delicate balancing act between navigating the risks of the CCP Inc. system and seeking to realize its advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

Although the West has a post-victory strategy for Ukraine, namely a framework for reconstruction and a path toward EU and NATO membership, it lacks a vision for Russia in the aftermath of a Ukrainian victory. This issue brief argues that the West should offer an alternative path for Russia and outline a vision for a more liberal future. Doing so could have a powerful effect on Russia and add pressure on the Kremlin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is sapping the strength and resilience of Vladimir Putin’s regime. Russia’s continued military failures there, combined with high casualties and worsening economic deprivation, could put his regime at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion has been more than a military debacle. The war has pulled back the curtain on the Kremlin and revealed an incompetent, corrupt, and poorly run state. It threatens to undermine Putin’s very legitimacy. The Kremlin prioritized modernizing its military for more than two decades, and despite substantial investment and presidential attention, the Russian military’s performance has been shambolic. Russia is perhaps now more isolated and less respected than at any other time during Putin’s 23-year reign. He is now asking more of the public than ever before. Desperate to salvage the situation in Ukraine, he has mobilized hundreds of thousand Russian men to replace the estimated 100,000 soldiers already killed or wounded in the war. There is now talk in Moscow of the war being existential. Keeping hold of territory in Ukraine is not existential for Russia — but it may be increasingly existential to the survival of the Putin regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine continues to reverse Russia’s post-February 2022 territorial gains, it may make Putin’s position untenable in Moscow. The West, led by the United States, is supporting Ukraine with modern advanced Western weaponry, massive financial aid, a global diplomatic campaign to isolate Russia, and an unprecedented sanctions effort designed to strangle the Russian economy. The Western objectives in Ukraine, despite claims otherwise, are relatively straightforward: to weaken Russia, preserve Ukrainian democracy, and enable Ukraine to reclaim its territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Keeping hold of territory in Ukraine is not existential for Russia — but it may be increasingly existential to the survival of the Putin regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West does not have a strategy of regime change in Russia. However, if its overall efforts prove successful and Ukraine can end the conflict on its own terms, Putin’s regime could fall. A failed war, combined with economic deprivation and loss of prestige, makes regime collapse a possible outcome. While it is hard to see how Putin departs, it is also hard to see how his regime survives such a situation. But although the West has a post-victory strategy for Ukraine, namely a framework for reconstruction and a path toward EU and NATO membership, it lacks a vision for Russia in the aftermath of a Ukrainian victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue brief assesses the potential for the war to prompt a transition of power in Russia, as well as the possible ramifications of this. It concludes, contrary to much of the prevailing view, that if Putin leaves power, it will likely be due to a reaction against the war and Putin’s hardline approach. The potential for Ukrainian military success to cause regime instability in Moscow has generated understandable nervousness among many Western governments about what could follow Putin. In fact, there is a growing assumption that what follows his reign could very well be worse. Such a pessimistic outlook might seem sober — but, as this issue brief argues, it could very well be wrong. This is because regime supporters and war hawks will, most likely, vigorously seek to keep Putin in power, prop up the regime, and stay the course. Thus, for a transition to occur there will need to be a strong demand for change. This will likely be driven by two interlocking factors: the Putin regime’s loss of legitimacy (with the public, the security services, elites, and the state) and the existence of a clear alternative to Russia’s current path. Ukraine and the West have created the conditions for the first, Putin’s loss of legitimacy. However, the West has not yet offered an alternative vision for Russia’s post-Putin future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a clear and more rational path for Moscow: end the war, reconcile with the West, and reverse Russia’s economic, diplomatic, and cultural isolation. However, while Russia can end the war on its own, reconciling with the West and reversing Russia’s isolation is ultimately up to the West. Thus, as this issue brief argues, building momentum for change inside Russia also requires signaling from the West that it is both open to future reengagement with a post-Putin Russia and that it believes such an alternative future is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and European leaders could make clear to Russia — both the public and especially elites — that the West ultimately sees Russia as part of Europe. There is therefore a path out of Russia’s isolation after Putin departs. Europe could pledge to “welcome back” a post-Putin Russia that ends the war, respects its neighbors, releases dissidents, restores political freedoms, and seeks to positively reengage with the West. The goal would be to make it known that an alternative European future is possible for Russia should Russians seek it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether this is possible or likely is a separate discussion. The West’s objective in offering a positive vision for Russia’s future is to put additional pressure on the regime by undermining the Kremlin narrative that the two are inevitable adversaries and by creating clear incentives for Russia to pursue a different course. This does not mean adopting a policy of “regime change,” something the West has rightly disavowed and has no means to implement in practice. Instead, it simply means leveraging the power the West does possess: its appeal. People, especially Europeans, want to be part of it; countries want to join it. There is no clearer example of this than Ukraine, where the government’s 2013 rejection of a closer relationship with the European Union spurred the Maidan Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling on Western leaders to talk about reintegrating Russia into Europe may seem utterly tone-deaf. Missiles continue to descend on Ukrainian cities, targeting playgrounds, pedestrian bridges, and civilian infrastructure. In the wake of Russia’s initial missile barrage on civilian infrastructure, Former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb assessed that “Russia is in the process of isolating itself from Europe for decades. . . . It did not have to be this way, but Putin decided otherwise.” The war in Ukraine has unleashed immense and justifiable anger not just toward the Kremlin but also toward the Russian public, with some prominent voices arguing that Russians are complicit through their support for Putin. There has been no mass protest or robust anti-war movement. Instead, the voices of dissent and criticism come from the far right, pushing Putin to increase the brutality. Because of this assumption that Russians are complicit, it is not surprising that when three civil society groups in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the Ukrainian government criticized the Nobel Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as much as righteous indignation toward Russia — and therefore the Russian public — is understandable and warranted, applying collective guilt is ultimately a self-defeating strategy. Doing so will likely strengthen Putin and Russian hardliners inside the country who claim that the West is nurturing hatred toward the entire Russian nation. If there is no way back for Russians, no alternative to isolation, why not just persist with a hardline anti-Western path? Moreover, since Russia is not going to be occupied by a conquering power, the reality is that there will be no accountability or justice for war crimes or reparations unless Russia itself is a willing participant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, the West has not provided any clear incentive for the Russian people or elite to mobilize against the regime. Currently, the message the West is sending is that Russia will be treated like Germany was after World War I and will face crushing reparations. Such calls may be morally and legally justified, but they also bolster Putin by demobilizing those with anti-regime sentiment. The Russian public or members of the elite are unlikely to mobilize against the regime if it means inheriting continued economic ruin (never-ending sanctions plus reparations), continued diplomatic isolation, and (potentially) more territorial concessions. Instead, Russians are more likely to act if there is a clearly better path available and if they have confidence there will be clear benefits for Russia should they succeed. Moreover, knowing that the regime, not the West, is preventing a better future can lead to growing frustration, which in time can grow and boil over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West shifting its rhetorical approach toward Russia and offering a positive vision for a post-Putin future might have little to no impact. However, it could add an additional source of pressure on an increasingly brittle regime and potentially open the door to rebuilding relations. Such a shift has little cost but significant potential upside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue brief first assesses the stability of the Putin regime, analyzing its strengths and weaknesses. It then sketches out potential trajectories of how Putin might depart. Finally, it outlines possible Western policy options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;auditing-regime-stability&quot;&gt;Auditing Regime Stability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion over the fate of the Putin regime is highly speculative and may seem little more than an esoteric policy discussion — but it does have tangible policy implications. A pessimistic view about what comes after Putin or a presumption that his regime is stable could prompt Western leaders to advocate seeking a swift end to the war, pressuring Ukraine to negotiate prematurely, and seeking to return to a more “stable and predictable” relationship with the Kremlin. However, a view that Putin’s regime could be unstable and that a post-Putin Russia might seek to reconcile with the West results in a different policy course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While still unlikely, the potential for Putin’s departure from office can no longer be discounted. The adage that autocratic regimes look stable until they aren’t holds true. Indeed, if Putin were to leave power, historians would likely treat it as inevitable and engage in fierce debates over which of the multiple causes was most important. What is clear is that the regime is on increasingly shaky ground and is getting squeezed on four interrelated fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, Russia is suffering significant setbacks on the battlefield.&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine now has a military advantage, benefiting from advanced Western weaponry and heightened morale. Kyiv has made remarkable gains around Kharkiv and retaken Kherson. If Ukraine continues to make significant battlefield advances and reclaim most or all the territory Russia has seized since February 2022, the war would become an unmitigated failure for Russia, amounting to a humiliating military defeat. This is especially the case for Putin, who has justified his tenure by pledging to restore Russian greatness and military strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military defeat on the battlefield can easily upend a country’s social and political order and lead to a crisis of legitimacy for the government. Argentina’s military junta, for instance, stepped down just three days after it surrendered to the United Kingdom following its invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982. Putin would need to shed blame and responsibility for military defeat to the military and other officials, but doing so could prompt a counterreaction from military and security officials who blame Putin and other political leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian reliance on amassing forces and its tolerance for high casualties might also slowly undermine support for the war and the regime. If many Russian soldiers are killed or wounded over the winter and early spring, with newly mobilized soldiers rushed to the frontlines bearing the brunt of the losses, it could lead to significant blowback on the home front. This could create a situation in which Russia’s military, which tends to accept high casualties, could run directly counter to the interests of the regime. Moreover, mobilized forces are older. They are men often with prior service who are now in their late 20s and older and are more likely to have families and dependents than 18–27-year-old conscripts. These losses will be deeply felt socially and economically in their communities, especially among Russia’s ethnic minorities. If Russia loses ground on the battlefield while suffering high casualties among mobilized soldiers, the reaction could be explosive. Thus, a long attritional war might favor Russia on paper — but also sap support for the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, mobilization could endanger public support.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin has built up a significant reservoir of public trust when it comes to use of the Russian military. The Russian public has seen the relatively successful deployment of force in Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria. Moreover, little to no sacrifice was required of the public for these past military operations. Russians expected the “special military operation” in Ukraine to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the war has been brought home to the average Russian through the “partial mobilization.” As Leonid Volkov — Alexei Navalny’s chief of staff and chairman of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which has been conducting polling inside of Russia since the war began — assessed, “Mobilization made them [the Russian public] aware of what’s actually going on. It reached out to almost every family in the country. It shocked those who believed in Putin’s ‘stability’ for decades.” Hundreds of thousands of Russian men have now been arbitrarily incorporated into the military to fight in a war that may have already resulted in more than 100,000 casualties. Additionally, partial mobilization has sent around 400,000 Russians, primarily men, fleeing their homeland. A September 2022 poll by the Levada Analytical Center showed that the majority of Russians experienced “anxiety, fear, and horror” or “anger” following the news on partial mobilization, while a growing number of citizens now consider the special military operation to be “rather” or “very” unsuccessful (31 percent in September 2022 versus 15 percent in May 2022).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little sense among Russians of what the war is about. General support for the war may remain high, but there is also strong support for a peaceful negotiated settlement, reflecting an overarching desire to end the fighting. Kremlin messaging about the war has also shifted continuously throughout the conflict, adding to the confusion. Though the war was initially about “denazification,” now its messaging tends to focus on conflict with NATO. Indeed, the public was prohibited from even calling the special military operation a “war.” Overall support for Putin and the invasion may look stable, but public support can shift rapidly against wars of choice when sacrifices mount. For instance, when fighting erupted in Iraq in spring 2004, a year after the U.S. invasion, public opinion in the United States abruptly swung against the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, the Russian economy is gradually being strangled by sanctions and export controls.&lt;/strong&gt; The announcement of massive sanctions by the United States, European Union, and others after the outbreak of the war led the value of the ruble to collapse, prompting a massive increase in interest rates. Yet the Russian economy has seemingly stabilized. The value of the ruble recovered, interest rates have been lowered, and the Russian economy is estimated to have contracted by only 3 percent in 2022. However, as Konstantin Sonin argues in Foreign Affairs, this is due to a drop in imports, which decreases the need for dollars or euros. Sanctions may not have affected the regime’s behavior, but there is substantial evidence that sanctions are effective at gradually strangling an economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, factories are closing and layoffs are mounting — and the effects will likely grow. Russia is transitioning to a fully fledged war economy, impacting the country’s ability to fulfill basic consumer needs. The mobilization of Russian men will also disrupt the labor market, as will the need to invest limited and shrinking resources to support the war effort. The downward economic spiral will only put more strain on the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, Putin’s credibility as a leader is gravely damaged.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin made a catastrophic error in invading Ukraine. As Mark Galleotti argues, “Putin-the-man may still cling to power for years, but Putin-the-legend is dead.” Never in the past had Putin appeared strategically weak or incompetent. His gross military miscalculation in Ukraine, which has taken the lives of tens of thousands of Russian soldiers and subjected the country’s citizens to long-term economic uncertainty, has damaged the president’s carefully crafted image as a formidable global player. Instead of restoring Russian greatness, Putin will have left Russia weak, isolated, and humiliated on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regime-stabilizing-factors&quot;&gt;Regime-Stabilizing Factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Putin’s downfall is by no means inevitable. There are also several factors that contribute to continued support for the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, the war has prompted greater repression.&lt;/strong&gt; Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin has significantly increased its repression and effectively closed down independent political forums. Dissidents have been jailed, with many facing years-long imprisonment. Journalists, academics, and policy analysts have fled Russia to avoid arrest. Anti-war protesters have been given long jail sentences. Thus, there is almost no political space to mobilize against the regime, which makes fomenting popular unrest exceptionally difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, mobilization might succeed in achieving Russia’s more limited war aims: to hold the territory it currently occupies in Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin’s mobilization may blunt Ukraine’s military gains, as Russia will likely seek simply to defend the territory it controls, while Ukraine would need to go on the offensive to retake territory. The war might stagnate over the winter — and, come spring, Russia’s new wave of freshly trained mobilized forces could prevent Ukraine from advancing. A stalemate, a new frozen conflict, would work just fine for Putin by de facto eliminating Ukraine’s path to EU and NATO membership. The war would then shift out of public consciousness, and Putin would gain breathing space to better address the immediate needs of the Russian public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, Russian propaganda has mobilized the country for war.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin failed to prepare the Russian public for a long, bloody campaign that requires sacrifice, even going so far as to prohibit calling the “special military operation” a “war.” However, in September, in preparation for partial mobilization, the Kremlin sought to build public support for more prolonged conflict. The Russian annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson created an opportunity to mobilize the Russian public, with Putin holding an elaborate ceremony and rally near the Kremlin to mark the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is also now justifying the conflict by claiming it is fighting NATO. According to a special report by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), an overarching narrative that the Kremlin employs domestically asserts NATO is using “Ukrainian Nazis” to “break” Russia. This is not a war against Ukraine but against a collective West that seeks to see the great Russian civilization stripped of its values, traditions, culture, and morale. As researchers at RUSI argue, “The decision to ideologically mobilize the Russian public for war with the use of increasingly radicalizing language was not a nationalistic response to events but was instead directed centrally . . . to put Russia on a war footing.” This message could resonate with some Russians, stabilize support for the war, and mitigate the Kremlin’s loss of legitimacy and prestige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, Kremlin elites are dependent on Putin.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin has created a regime that centers around him, making it highly risky for insiders to seek his ouster. Thus, as the next section shows, supporters of the regime will likely push back strongly against efforts to remove him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-a-transition&quot;&gt;Assessing a Transition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to predict how Russia would transition to someone else or something new if the situation becomes untenable for Putin — yet the emerging consensus that Putin would likely be replaced by someone worse may be unfounded. An effort to replace Putin will probably emerge out of a movement to end the war, not to further it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most analyses of what could come next tend to look at Putin’s court and examine who among his inner circle might be a potential successor. This has led to fears that Putin could be replaced by even more of a hardliner, such as Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev. Such analysis can lead to the conclusion that the West should favor stability in Russia and a face-saving end to the war for Putin because a humiliating defeat could give rise to a truly unhinged president (i.e., it is better to deal with the devil you know — Putin — than the devil you don’t).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is difficult to see a dynamic forming in which Putin is replaced by a marginally more hawkish figure from within his inner circle. This is because Putin is already hawkish. This is, after all, his war, on which he is already doubling down. Under Putin’s “partial mobilization,” the military is bombing civilian targets, committing war crimes, pulverizing cities, and showing a willingness to take enormous battlefield losses. The Russian strategy being pursued is the hardline strategy. Moreover, Putin has also shown that he listens to hardliners. Those advocating taking the war to Ukrainian civilians and mobilizing the population have gotten what they wanted. Yet, for hardliners there is always more that can be done. A more depraved hawk could marginally dial up the atrocities or could move to use a nuclear weapon — but this is a road to ruin. In fact, the effort to move in a more hardline direction could prompt the elite and public to step in to stop such a leader from ascending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The replacement of Putin with a more hardline figure is not impossible, but neither does it help fellow hawks preserve the regime. Putin has a two-decade relationship with the Russian public and has built up an immense reservoir of trust. Although that reservoir is being depleted, any new hardline successor would likely come from within the regime’s inner circle and would have similar baggage. Why orchestrate a risky soft coup to just stick with the same hawkish approach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if power transitions to a member of Putin’s court, the new administration will likely be short-lived due to infighting. In Egypt in 2011, Hosni Mubarak tried to end his 30-year reign by transferring power to his former intelligence chief, Omar Suleiman, whom he abruptly made vice president. However, this was not sustainable, and the armed forces almost immediately assumed power until elections could be held. Any time a long-standing autocrat departs, it destabilizes the entire governing network they have built up over the course of their rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has created a regime that centers around him, a power-vertical, in which he is not just the key decisionmaker but also keeps all the nodes of power in balance. If he is removed, the system would likely be in danger of toppling. Putin himself has not figured out the conundrum of succession, either how to leave or who should succeed him. Instead, he has kept all options open while preventing the rise of any undisputed successor. The 2020 constitutional reforms, instead of bringing clarity on a transition, allowed him to stay in power for life. This is in part because of Putin’s ego; many politicians are reluctant to leave the stage. However, it is also because he cannot figure out how to leave without the system collapsing — and his legacy with it. If Putin surrendered his position at the top of the patronage network he has spent over two decades constructing, he would no longer be able to guarantee his personal safety, nor the security of his wealth. The same goes for Putin’s closest lieutenants, who rely on his legitimacy to defend their own positions within the country’s vertical power structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore hard to see how the existing regime survives without Putin. Far from pushing Putin out, hardliners and regime stalwarts are probably incredibly reluctant to move against him. In fact, they will likely do everything they can to keep him in power. This is perhaps the most important factor protecting the regime from collapse. Thus, if Putin is replaced or loses power, it will likely be because the war in Ukraine goes very badly. It will be because there is a desperate need for change, not just for a new leader but for a new approach to the war that does not double down on but rather ends it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenarios-for-a-power-transition&quot;&gt;Scenarios for a Power Transition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways in which a change in power could occur in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, the regime might become unable to govern and simply collapse.&lt;/strong&gt; Daniel Treisman’s article in Foreign Affairs outlines how “a comprehensive meltdown of the regime” could come about, “as multiple challenges overwhelm its [the Kremlin’s] capacity to react and dysfunction drains confidence in Putin’s leadership.” He explains, “An overcentralized system can work tolerably in quiet times. The clear lines of command even help in minor crises. But the need for Putin to weigh in personally becomes a serious flaw when problems are complex and fast developing. The center is quickly overwhelmed, which can lead to cascading mistakes. . . . As the burden grows, so does the danger of loss of control.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bureaucrats and functionaries in this scenario might quietly rebel by hesitating, delaying, and obfuscating. In doing so, they gradually stop propping up the regime. This is, after all, Putin’s experience in Dresden: When his KGB outpost was surrounded, he called for military reinforcements, but “Moscow was silent.” Instead of trying to curry favor with Moscow, regional governors might hedge and begin pushing back, as they are uncertain about which way the political winds are blowing and do not want to be caught on the wrong side. Perhaps governors in certain provinces might refuse to repress anti-war protests or deflect blame away from the Kremlin. As Treisman concludes, “Most of the regime’s enforcers are motivated by corruption rather than conviction, but they act out of faith that the system will survive. When that faith fades, the result is not a coup but foot-dragging, inaction, and ultimately desertion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, elites or insiders might initiate a coup.&lt;/strong&gt; The need to blame someone if the war goes badly could prompt the security services and the military, as well as oligarchs, to mobilize. However, Putin has worked hard to coup-proof his regime, and there are few informal connections between leaders of the security services’ various power centers. Treisman explains that “the obstacles to such a coup are formidable. Putin has rigged the system with numerous tripwires to prevent one. Multiple agencies watch over each other. . . . Those with armed men at their command lack the mutual trust to organize a conspiracy, and any attempt to do so would be hard to hide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But working in an intense crisis environment can also quickly build connections, relationships, and trust among officials. Moreover, if a person’s job and life are on the line, they may be more willing to take risks to plot or scheme. As one former Putin confidant in Moscow described “the atmosphere in the halls of power” to the New York Times, “We’re giving each other looks, but to say something is impossible.” However, as pressure builds, the risk calculation can shift as well, and discontented oligarchs with large reserves of cash could bribe or incentivize officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History is also replete with coups led by resentful mid- and junior-level officers mobilizing against their inept senior officers and political leaders. Russian officers’ utter mismanagement of the war in Ukraine and the disregard for the well-being of their soldiers could trigger a backlash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, regime stalwarts might move to replace Putin, not to end the regime but to save it.&lt;/strong&gt; A new leader could be appointed simply to try to relieve pressure on the regime. This might be someone from inside who could end the war and negotiate with the West, perhaps a technocrat — for example, from the Central Bank or the Ministry of Finance — or a Western-friendly oligarch. As Vladimir Milov, a former deputy minister of energy and an economic adviser to Alexei Navalny, has remarked, “This may look as something resemblant of the environment which existed in the Soviet Union before 1985 and the arrival of Gorbachev: he started his ‘perestroika’ not out of the blue, but rather as a response to diminished public credibility of the Soviet system and visible bottom-up popular demand for change.” Alternatively, power could be transferred to a regime insider in a desperate effort to maintain continuity, as occurred in Egypt with Mubarak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, mass protests or movements might emerge.&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, there appears to be little prospect of Russians mobilizing against the regime. Putin’s approval ratings remain high, dissidents have been jailed or exiled, and repression has been dialed up. However, outrage or discontent can emerge from unlikely places under an autocratic regime. In Argentina, it was the mothers of the disappeared who stood up to the military junta. What sparks a protest against an autocratic regime can sometimes come from seemingly nowhere, such the self-immolation of a fruit seller in Tunisia or the murder of a young woman arrested for allegedly not wearing a headscarf in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four scenarios for regime transition are not mutually exclusive. They can — and likely will — interact with and reinforce each other if a transition occurs. Protests can prompt elites to act and bureaucrats to stop working. A clear defeat in the war could lead to growing pressure on the regime from all quarters: elites, the public, and the security services. These pressures could become self-reinforcing, forming a vicious cycle for the Kremlin in which defections or protests in one part of society facilitate them in others, prompting individuals in power to take actions that would have been deemed unimaginable weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-us-policy&quot;&gt;Implications for U.S. Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developments inside Russia will be decided by Russians. However, the West does have the ability to influence perceptions among elites and the public about what a post-Putin Russia might look like, which could both add to pressure on the regime and help shape the perceptions and ambitions of those who comes after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for this to occur, Russia would have to end the war in Ukraine, open up political space, and reengage the West and Ukraine productively. U.S. president Joe Biden could make clear that a post-Putin Russia that takes such steps would see sanctions and travel restrictions melt away. Russia would be welcomed back to global sporting competitions, from the World Cup to the Olympics. It might also regain its global status, rejoin the Group of Seven, and restart the U.S.-Russian security dialogue aimed at building trust and putting limits on conventional and nuclear forces. Biden and European leaders could even float a longer-term possibility of Russia joining the European Union and NATO — which has an open-door policy in which any country can join if all allies agree, meaning membership is potentially open to Russia, too. While this may sound fanciful and utterly implausible, there is little reason not to leave open the possibility. The strength of the West’s message comes from the fact that this is obviously a better course than doubling down on a hopeless, endless war for imperial aggrandizement that has resulted in huge human losses, economic strangulation, and international pariah status for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Kremlin has found the notion that Russia is inevitably at odds with the West useful in justifying its isolation from Europe. Putin has even attempted to construct a “Eurasian” identity for Russia, with which he has sought to contrast the increasing liberalism of the West with Russia’s traditional conservatism, such as on LGBTQ+ issues. The Kremlin’s rhetoric and propaganda has shifted perceptions; as a 2021 Levada poll found, fewer Russians think of Russia as a European country than did in 2019 or 2008. Yet Russia is a European country in that it has historically been oriented westward and been a pivotal player in European affairs. The pre-Soviet tsars were heavily orientated toward Europe, and even during the Soviet and Putin eras, Russia’s major geopolitical, economic, and culture focus has been toward Europe. In other words, Putin’s efforts to construct a Eurasian identity naturally at odds with Europe rest on shaky ground — though his narrative has been bolstered by current tensions with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could prove powerful to reject the premise that the West and Russia are inevitably at odds and highlight that Putin is the one isolating Russia, preventing it from having a European — and thus more prosperous — future. While getting such a message to penetrate Russian society and override state propaganda is difficult, it is not impossible. Messages and narratives can and do find a way to reach Russian elites and the highly connected public. Since the partial mobilization in September, the broader Russian public is also now seeking more credible information about the war in Ukraine. Biden and European leaders could give high-profile addresses and interviews on notable outlets run by Russian expatriates, such as Meduza, TV Rain, the Moscow Times, and iStories. The Biden administration could engage the growing Russian expatriate community and empower its efforts to broadcast accurate information about the war to the Russian public. Latvia’s recent suspension of TV Rain was in this sense self-defeating. Instead of stifling these outlets, the West should be supporting and encouraging them, as they are the most effective vehicle for reaching the Russian public. The West should also be engaging Russians online, including on platforms such as Telegram and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It could prove powerful to reject the premise that the West and Russia are inevitably at odds and highlight that Putin is the one isolating Russia, preventing it from having a European — and thus more prosperous — future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describing possible futures for a post-Putin Russia could create another avenue of pressure on the Kremlin. Although such a messaging effort may have little to no impact, the cost of promoting a new narrative is virtually nothing. Meanwhile, it could have several beneficial effects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, it could increase public frustration with the Putin regime.&lt;/strong&gt; The West could try to make clear that Putin is the one preventing Russia from having a European future. This — combined with military defeat, economic deprivation, and geopolitical isolation — might contribute to some Russians believing change is possible and help trigger popular unrest. To be clear, a new message from the West or speech from a U.S. president is not going to trigger popular unrest in Russia. But the belief that another path is possible for Russia, combined with military defeat, economic deprivation, and geopolitical isolation, might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, it could undermine Putin’s war narrative.&lt;/strong&gt; Making clear to Russians that the West’s issue is with Putin and not with the average Russian also helps undercut Putin’s desperate effort to mobilize public support for the war. Putin needs to make up for lost time since he had deliberately sought to demobilize the Russian public at first by describing the war in Ukraine as a “special military operation.” In doing so, he was signaling that this was a limited, technical mission the public did not need to worry about. He even initially cracked down on anyone who dared call it a “war.” The Kremlin has not prepared the public for sacrifice or a prolonged conflict. With the war going badly, the enemy now has to be cast as more than just Ukraine — because “mighty” Russia cannot be getting ground down by “puny” Ukraine. The narrative has thus shifted to it being a fight against the West, which is out to destroy Russia. However, a message of possible Western-Russian reconciliation post-Putin would directly undercut the regime’s broader narrative of eternal struggle with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, it could mobilize those upset with the direction Putin has taken.&lt;/strong&gt; It might help shift the calculation of elites, especially as pressure builds on the regime. Instead of sitting on their hands, elites might begin to take risks and seek out like-minded figures. Additionally, if regime collapse causes a sudden power vacuum and there is competition for power, a new leader or faction could gain support by arguing they can get sanctions removed by ending the war and improving relations with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, it could help nudge the aftermath of regime collapse in a positive direction.&lt;/strong&gt; Laying out a Western or European vision for Russia’s future now could mitigate paranoia about the West’s intentions within Russia if the regime collapses. The West could highlight that it does not seek the country’s breakup or the destruction of the state — especially given its tremendous concerns about the security of Russia’s nuclear arsenal, the potential for renewed ethno-national violence, and the threat of successionist movements as a result of a geopolitical vacuum. Acknowledging that the West would be eager to reengage post-Putin Russia happens to both be entirely accurate and may reassure future Russian leaders, political operators, and influencers that they do not have to fear renewed engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path toward any potential partnership or reincorporation will entail a careful confidence-building dance in which each side, deeply skeptical of the other, gradually grows to trust the other’s intentions. This process broke down in the post–Cold War period, especially during Putin’s rise to and consolidation of power. Many nations, especially Russia’s neighbors, will be deeply skeptical of its potential rehabilitation and favor an uncompromising policy that weakens Russia or furthers its disintegration. While this skepticism may be warranted, the main U.S. objective in a post-Putin Russia would be to transform it from an anti-Western, revisionist actor into one that — even if not entirely Western-aligned — at least does not threaten its neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, engaging in the rhetoric of reconciliation does not mean softening sanctions, slowing military assistance to Ukraine, or delaying pursuit of war criminals. On the contrary, the regime, the elite, and the Russian public should know that the present path is a road to economic ruin, global pariah status, and military collapse — though such rhetoric should avoid stereotyping or characterizing Russians as irredeemable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics might describe the discussion of a post Putin-Russia as the United States shifting to a policy of “regime change.” However, there is no point to pursuing regime change because the United States does not have the means to execute such a policy short of direct military intervention, which is unthinkable in the Russian context. Contrary to Putin’s vehement claims, the United States cannot cause “color revolutions.” All it and Europe can do is offer potential inclusion in the West should a country go down a democratic path. But that may be the biggest incentive of all; Ukraine’s 2014 Maidan Revolution, for instance, happened when people took to the streets to demand a European future. Since the Biden administration’s goal is to put pressure on the Putin regime, it is a logical extension to put ideological pressure on the Kremlin as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others might claim that talk of reincorporating Russia could let it off the hook for its crimes, arguing that Russia needs accountability for its actions. The problem with this argument is that bringing war criminals to trial and collecting potential reparations requires Russia’s willing participation, which will likely depend on Russia seeing a path or trajectory for cooperation with and inclusion in the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-a-liberal-democratic-russia-possible&quot;&gt;Is a Liberal Democratic Russia Possible?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is good reason to doubt the potential for a liberal democratic Russia that is not hostile to the West. Putin is in many ways a reflection of the Russian public. He is popular in no small measure because hardline nationalism is popular within Russia, while democracy remains badly stained by the political chaos and economic collapse of the 1990s, which led to the development of crony capitalism instead of a strong and vibrant market economy. Much of the Russian public has also been fed anti-Western propaganda for most of the past century. Thus, any new leader or regime might revert to a hardline nationalist posture in order to maintain public support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Russia might not be able to survive as a state without autocratic rule, as its multiethnic polity built through imperial conquest could fall apart without Moscow wielding uncompromising authority. Even if Russian leaders seek a democratic future, the country could still unravel. Russia could descend back into the lawless chaos of the 1990s, when mafia groups, armed oligarchs, and separatist movements took advantage of the weakened state. This is undoubtedly a concern, but Russia today is very different. In the early 1990s, it faced a difficult transition from a command economy to a free-market one, and the resulting economic collapse severely weakened Russian state capacity. By contrast, a move away from Putin could bring tremendous economic benefits. A new, more liberal regime in Moscow would not face the same struggles as in the 1990s. Moreover, though there is a real potential for a new wave of secessionist movements, it is counterbalanced by broader Russian patriotism, identity, and attachment to the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The odds are slim that Russia will choose a liberal, democratic, pro-Western path — even if the public were free to do so — but neither is it impossible. Although creating a multiethnic representative democracy in Russia, a country with a near-continuous autocratic history, seems far-fetched, similar things were said about Germany after World War II. Europe, a continent almost always at war throughout its history, came together in a federal union. While Russian NATO or EU membership currently seems implausible, the West should at least be open to the potential possibility, however slim or distant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has exposed the folly of the West’s excessive optimism about the “end of history” after the fall of the Soviet Union, particularly the vision that economic engagement would inevitably lead to democratic change. But that vision, while simplistic, was not contrived out of thin air. It was borne out of lessons of the post–World War II and the post–Cold War European experience. The West may be in danger of going too far in unlearning the lessons of its past and assuming its adversaries are intrinsically wicked and immune to the appeal of democracy. Part of the West’s strength is the belief that, on balance, systems in which people are free to select their leaders will do a better job overall than other forms of government. The West should not forget the inherent appeal of its free democratic system, which so worries autocrats because it inspires revolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The West may be in danger of going too far in unlearning the lessons of its past and assuming its adversaries are intrinsically wicked and immune to the appeal of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the skeptics are right, which they may be, that Russia would never be incorporated into the West and is doomed to have an autocratic future, Western leaders should still convey an integrationist message to add pressure on the Putin regime and undermine its narrative about the war in Ukraine. Demonstrating that an alternative future is possible will likely do more to undermine Putin than any performative condemnations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the future of Russia will be determined by Russians, not by the West. However, it costs nothing to let Russians know that, if they pursue democracy, the West will embrace them. Such action might affect how Russians think about the Putin regime and their future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as rhetoric of retribution may feel justified, just as it did toward Germany after World Wars I and II, the smarter path focused on rehabilitation and integration. The West did not offer this out of generosity but because of geopolitical competition with the Soviet Union. Similarly, encouraging and incentivizing a post-Putin Russia to drop its anti-Western outlook and its malign revisionist approach to the international order would have profound geopolitical implications for the United States vis-à-vis China, European security, and the liberal world order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significantly, the Soviet Union collapsed not when Reagan or the West had an iron fist but when they had an outstretched arm. The Green Movement in Iran erupted not when the United States was threatening to bomb the country but after a newly inaugurated President Obama addressed the Iranian people in a Nowruz message, offering a “new beginning” that became impossible when, three months later, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was reelected president under dubious circumstances. Correlation does not equal causation, but there is never one factor that causes revolution. Offering a segment of society hope for a better, more liberal future can have a powerful effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The war in Ukraine has had multiple impacts on the Korean peninsula. It has reminded South Korea of the strategic importance of the U.S.-ROK alliance as a buffer against hostility from outside powers, while also intensifying concerns about South Korea’s vulnerability as a nuclear-weapons-free power facing a nuclear-armed North Korea. For North Korea, the war in Ukraine seems to have amplified the importance of nuclear weapons for its security while prompting Pyongyang to consider a new “first-use” nuclear doctrine as well as the operational deployment of tactical nuclear weapons — imitating Putin’s tactics in Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The war in Ukraine has also produced a favorable external environment for North Korea’s continued development of its nuclear and missile programs. North Korea’s increasing weapons capabilities, its threats to use nuclear weapons for offensive purposes, and the vulnerability of U.S. national missile defense interceptors to North Korean multiple independent reentry vehicle technologies have led the South Koreans to question the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collectively, these shifts in the strategic landscape call for the United States and its allies to reexamine traditional approaches to the North Korea nuclear issue and devise ways to increase the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence. The recent election of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol, whose positions on North Korea and regional issues align closely with those of the Biden administration, presents opportunities for the alliance to pursue new initiatives that will enhance the stability, security, and prosperity of the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This report presents actionable recommendations for navigating North Korea policy and strengthening U.S. extended deterrence during these uncertain times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-north-korea&quot;&gt;ON NORTH KOREA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea is unlikely to return to diplomacy until it achieves its weapons development goals explicated in recent speeches. Nonetheless, the allies should map out policies that prepare for whatever actions Pyongyang may take in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for an eventual return to negotiations, with low expectations for short-term breakthroughs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devise roadmaps toward complete and verifiable denuclearization that include interim steps to reduce threat levels and build confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signal openness to diplomacy and continued readiness to talk without preconditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance defense, deterrence, and sanctions enforcement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To strengthen deterrence and defense:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Resume &lt;strong&gt;joint military exercises&lt;/strong&gt; that had been suspended or downgraded in previous negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support South Korea’s military improvements&lt;/strong&gt;, including the Kill Chain, early deployment of Iron Dome, directed energy possibilities, upgraded ship-based defenses, and an additional Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery — moving South Korea to the top of the list for its purchase, given the urgency of the North Korean missile threat.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Expand &lt;strong&gt;U.S.-ROK space cooperation&lt;/strong&gt; to strengthen reconnaissance capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Do not, under current circumstances, deploy U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula nor condone the acquisition of nuclear weapons by South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop a &lt;strong&gt;broad counter-missile strategy&lt;/strong&gt; that focuses on detecting and defending against North Korean missiles and launchers, disrupting its capability networks, and destroying its launchers and missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Investigate new concepts of missile defense, such as boost-phase systems that would help overcome the limitations of current systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase &lt;strong&gt;trilateral defense coordination&lt;/strong&gt; among the United States, South Korea, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reinstate the Trilateral Consultation and Oversight Group as a regular channel of communication and policy coordination on North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consider additional forms of military cooperation to deter North Korea, including information sharing, anti-submarine warfare, missile defense, contingency planning, and regular trilateral exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bolster sanctions enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lead efforts, together with Japan, to &lt;strong&gt;enforce existing North Korea sanctions&lt;/strong&gt;, including deterring illegal ship-to-ship transfers and pressuring countries to return North Korean laborers working overseas in violation of international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Be ready to offer &lt;strong&gt;sanctions lifting but only for substantive and difficult-to-reverse steps&lt;/strong&gt; on denuclearization by North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Expand secondary sanctions against China and Russia if they do not comply with UN Security Council Resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate positions on humanitarian assistance and human rights as separate from denuclearization diplomacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider immediate humanitarian assistance to North Korea through the international aid community to improve conditions for North Korean citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Appoint a U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-us-extended-deterrence&quot;&gt;ON U.S. EXTENDED DETERRENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. extended deterrence commitment to South Korea involves two central purposes: to deter North Korean aggression, and to prevent nuclear proliferation. The commitment has physical and psychological aspects that both affect its credibility. As such, &lt;strong&gt;extended deterrence requires consistent U.S. demonstrations and assurances of both capabilities and will.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid policies that put the two purposes of extended deterrence into conflict&lt;/strong&gt;, for instance, by advancing deterrence but setting back nonproliferation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide reassurance and clarification on existing and new U.S. capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emphasize that the U.S.-ROK “community of fate” — referring to the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea that tie the country together with the United States strategically — forms the core of extended deterrence, regardless of additional U.S. capabilities that may be introduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve joint planning and execution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;strong&gt;framework for joint nuclear planning&lt;/strong&gt;, similar to a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) planning group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sustain practices such as sending a senior South Korean liaison officer to U.S. Strategic Command.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reactivate the high-level Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group (EDSCG).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Streamline protocols for direct Space-Based Infrared System access to South Korea in addition to the geographic commanders, as the United States does for Israel and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supplement U.S. extended deterrence dialogues with South Korea and Japan with a &lt;strong&gt;track 1.5 trilateral strategic exchange&lt;/strong&gt; in order to stay informed about developments in each country and identify opportunities for coordination&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursue U.S. military adjustments and improvements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change the regional strategic and nuclear posture to allow for more robust and constant demonstrations of U.S. capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This could entail the continuous presence in the region of either U.S. submarines equipped with nuclear cruise missiles or strategic bombers or investing in infrastructure in South Korea to receive U.S. dual-capable aircraft.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve U.S. national missile defense capabilities vis-à-vis North Korea, including through accelerating plans to deploy interceptors equipped with Next Generation Interceptor technology and investing in boost-phase missile defense technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restore funds for and continue pursuing the U.S. nuclear sea-launched cruise missile program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lay pre-decisional groundwork for possible redeployment of U.S. low-yield nuclear weapons at some point in the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider allied tabletop planning exercises that would be explicitly pre-decisional and leave the timeline and scope of weapons deliberately ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calibrate decisionmaking to shifts in the security environment and the North Korean threat level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reorienting-the-alliance-in-a-shifting-global-landscape&quot;&gt;Reorienting the Alliance in a Shifting Global Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is experiencing a number of tectonic shifts that present new challenges for the U.S.-ROK (Republic of Korea) alliance and reinforce its importance as a basis for peace and stability in Northeast Asia. The aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic have roiled international commercial markets and raised new questions about supply chain resilience, prompting major industries to consider fundamental changes to future plans. Chinese president Xi Jinping’s increasingly active management of China’s economy is creating new geopolitical risks for international businesses. And tightening relations between China and Russia — solidified with Xi and Vladimir Putin’s declaration at the Beijing Olympics of a partnership with “no limits” — point to a global geopolitical realignment that will be reinforced by economic trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine, following Russia’s unprovoked invasion on February 24, has monumentally impacted world politics and Asia. The war has made Russia weaker militarily and economically (due to the impact of unprecedented sanctions) but also more dangerous, as a declining power willing to take on more risks. China’s support for Russia has diminished its soft power as a defender of sovereignty and territorial integrity while increasing its vulnerability to secondary sanctions it cannot afford due to its own mounting economic problems. And the United States is now focused on Europe and needs to recalibrate its global strategy even as China remains its pacing threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world becomes more bifurcated between authoritarian and democratic powers, the war in Ukraine has several implications for the United States and its allies: a shifting balance of power due to Russia’s decline; complication of Xi’s designs on Taiwan given Moscow’s multiple failures and heavy sanctions; greater U.S. and Japanese attention to reinforcing deterrence in the Taiwan Strait; greater cohesion among democratic countries; heightened unity of purpose and appreciation for the liberal international order as a foundation for global peace and stability; and the undermining of the Xi-Putin narrative that the future lies with China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This degree of change presents a perilous and uncharted landscape but also new opportunities for coalition building for Washington and Seoul to navigate in the coming months. Since this group last met in early 2021, the U.S.-ROK alliance has made significant progress in tackling some of the headwinds that have previously held the relationship back from its full potential. During the early months of the Biden administration, contentious issues such as negotiations over the Special Measures Agreement were resolved, paving the way for a successful summit between Presidents Joe Biden and Moon Jae-in in May 2021 and the release of a comprehensive U.S.-ROK Leaders’ Joint Statement that advocated for deeper cooperation across several dimensions of the relationship. The recent election of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol, whose positions on Japan, North Korea, China, and Indo-Pacific strategy align closely with Washington, will enhance the alliance’s effectiveness in dealing with the region’s most pressing challenges. The successful first summit of the two leaders in May 2022 laid out an ambitious agenda for Washington and Seoul as President Yoon seeks to build South Korea’s role as a global player and supporter of the rules-based international order. Channeling these shared perspectives into concrete initiatives that will enhance the stability, security, and prosperity of the region during a period of compounding uncertainties will be the central challenge for the alliance in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This degree of change presents a perilous and uncharted landscape but also new opportunities for coalition building for Washington and Seoul to navigate in the coming months.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-the-war-in-ukraine-for-the-korean-peninsula&quot;&gt;Implications of the War in Ukraine for the Korean Peninsula&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its broader global and regional implications, the war in Ukraine has had multiple impacts on the Korean peninsula, with varied takeaways for the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For South Korea, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked a strong response at the societal level — with individuals and civic groups rallying to support Ukraine and condemn Russia’s actions — as well as a strengthened appreciation for the importance of liberal values in a country’s foreign policy to promote stability and security. The war has also reminded South Koreans of the strategic importance of the U.S.-ROK alliance, grounded in shared values as well as security guarantees that decrease the chances that South Korea will find itself in Ukraine’s situation. For alliance managers in Seoul and Washington, the war in Ukraine has validated the importance of focusing on military readiness before a threat is realized, rather than after. All of these effects should help to fortify the U.S.-ROK alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the war in Ukraine has intensified concerns among South Koreans about their vulnerability as a nuclear-weapons-free power facing a nuclear-armed North Korea, particularly given the possibility that new leadership in the United States in the coming years might, again, consider U.S. troop withdrawals as the Trump administration did. While the Yoon government will manage this concern through strengthening extended deterrence with the United States and trilateral coordination with the United States and Japan, policy discussions within South Korea are likely to continue to feature a range of suggestions to reduce South Korea’s vulnerability, such as the rotation of dual-use strategic assets, redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons, and introduction of a nuclear sharing plan on the peninsula in the style of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine seems to have underscored for North Korea the importance of nuclear weapons for its security. Whether this is the correct conclusion or not, the regime reiterated its nuclear ambitions in April 2022, thereby decreasing prospects for denuclearization. North Korea drew a similar lesson from the Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan cases. Again, whether correct or not, North Korean officials stated with conviction during the Six Party Talks in 2006 that the United States would not have attacked a nuclear-armed Iraq or Afghanistan (implying the same for a nuclear-armed North Korea).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has also noted Putin’s threat to use nuclear weapons to deter NATO’s intervention in Ukraine. At a military parade on April 25, Kim Jong-un noted that “our nukes can never be confined to the single mission of war deterrent” and suggested that he would consider the pre-emptive use of these weapons to deter threats from outside forces or to gain superiority in a conventional conflict. These statements seemed to reveal a new “first-use” nuclear doctrine for Pyongyang in which the threat of nuclear weapons could be used to deter the United States from intervening in any armed conflict on the Korean peninsula, mirroring Putin’s moves in Ukraine. The possibility of North Korea’s development and operational deployment of tactical nuclear weapons, in particular, has heightened concerns among South Koreans regarding the reliability of U.S. extended deterrence and amplified calls for the redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons on the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final implication of the war in Ukraine for Korea is the favorable external environment it has produced for North Korea’s continued development of its nuclear and missile programs. Previously, Beijing and Moscow were willing to join forces with the United States and its allies to punish North Korea following its provocations, even as they helped North Korea evade sanctions. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, however, Beijing and Moscow have refused to enforce existing sanctions and vetoed any further actions against North Korea in the UN Security Council. Given this situation, additional nuclear tests by North Korea would be unlikely to prompt a serious reaction from China and Russia. This marks a critical juncture in regional dynamics — with Beijing and Moscow now viewing Pyongyang’s provocations more as a means to gain advantages over Washington than a concerning threat to regional stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these shifts in the strategic landscape call for the United States and its allies to (1) reexamine traditional approaches to the nuclear issue in the diplomatic and military realms and (2) devise ways to enhance the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence in order to reduce South Korea’s (and Japan’s) sense of vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;north-koreas-actions-and-objectives&quot;&gt;North Korea’s Actions and Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pyongyang was relatively quiet during the first year of the Biden administration. This could be a result of severe internal difficulties due to its strict Covid-19 lockdown and ongoing economic challenges or because it wanted to find out if the Biden administration might consider lifting the sanctions that Pyongyang had aimed to negotiate an end to during the failed 2019 Hanoi summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of 2022, however, North Korea has embarked on an extensive missile testing campaign, conducting missile launches on 22 separate occasions, ranging from short-range hypersonic missiles to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). These tests have helped North Korea make significant advances toward its aim of achieving a reliable capability to penetrate U.S. missile defenses and strike the U.S. homeland. Pyongyang could then use this capability to deter a U.S. attack on North Korea while generating doubts among U.S. allies in the region that Washington would put one of its own cities at risk by responding to a North Korean attack on an ally. North Korea also likely aspires to employ tactical nuclear weapons as an asymmetric capability to fundamentally change the balance of power on the Korean peninsula in its favor, enabling Pyongyang to dictate the terms of interaction with South Korea in the economic, security, and political spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Jong-un laid out his weapons development objectives in unusual detail in his January 2021 remarks at the Eighth Party Congress of the Workers Party of Korea (see Box 1). At the April 25 military parade, Kim reiterated his determination to improve the country’s nuclear capabilities “in terms of both quality and scale.” His ultimate goal is to achieve credible, albeit rudimentary capabilities to build three legs of a potential nuclear triad, as well as a tactical nuclear weapons capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1: Excerpts from Summary of Kim Jong-un’s Remarks on Weapons Development during the January 2021 Eighth Party Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recalling that the Party Central Committee decided to develop a global strike rocket with more powerful warheads and an improved warhead control system and carried out this historic task by relying on the patriotism and loyalty of national defence scientists, the report affirmed that the new-type gigantic rocket on an 11-axis self-propelled launcher displayed during the military parade in celebration of the 75th founding anniversary of the Party fully demonstrated the ultra-modernity and great striking capability of our nuclear force.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The national defence science sector developed the super-large MLRS, a super-power attack weapon the world’s weaponry field had never known, and proceeded to develop ultra-modern tactical nuclear weapons including new-type tactical rockets and intermediate-range cruise missiles whose conventional warheads are the most powerful in the world.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The report also noted that in the period under review the sector of national defence scientific research was conducting research into perfecting the guidance technology for [a] multi-warhead rocket at the final stage, finished research into developing warheads of different combat missions including the hypersonic gliding flight warheads for new-type ballistic rockets and was making preparations for their test manufacture.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The report made public with pride that the standard of the goal in the modernization of medium-sized submarine was set correctly and it was remodeled experimentally to open up a bright prospect for remarkably enhancing the existing subsurface operational capabilities of our navy, that the design of new nuclear-powered submarine was researched and was in the stage of final examination and the designing of various electronic weapons, unmanned striking equipment, means of reconnaissance and detection and military reconnaissance satellite were completed, and that other achievements were made in national defence research of gigantic significance in developing the People’s Army into a powerful one with the strongest military muscle in the world.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is necessary to develop the nuclear technology to a higher level and make nuclear weapons smaller and lighter for more tactical uses. This will make it possible to develop tactical nuclear weapons to be used as various means according to the purposes of operational duty and targets of strike in modern warfare, and continuously push ahead with the production of super-sized nuclear warheads.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The report also set a goal of attaining an advanced capability for making a preemptive and retaliatory nuclear strike by further raising the rate of precision good enough to strike and annihilate any strategic targets within a range of 15,000 kilometres with pinpoint accuracy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;And the tasks were brought up to develop and introduce hypersonic gliding flight warheads in a short period, push ahead with the development of solid-fuel engine-propelled inter- continental underwater and ground ballistic rockets as scheduled, and possess a nuclear- powered submarine and an underwater-launch nuclear strategic weapon which will be of great importance in raising the long-range nuclear striking capability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The report also referred to the need to secure the ability of reconnaissance and information gathering based on operation of a military reconnaissance satellite in the near future, and conduct in real earnest the most important research to develop reconnaissance drones and other means of reconnaissance capable of precisely reconnoitering up to 500 km deep into the front.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Making the military equipment intelligent, precise, unmanned, high-performance and light should be set as the priority target of the munitions industry, and research and development be oriented to this end.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean behavior and rhetoric suggest that missile and nuclear tests will continue in the coming weeks and months. Externally, as noted above, North Korea faces a favorable environment for weapons development, with the United States focused on the war in Ukraine and China and Russia more closely aligned and unwilling to impose sanctions on North Korea following provocations. China and Russia are also as amenable as ever to facilitating North Korea’s evasion of sanctions so that Pyongyang can acquire necessary components for its weapons programs. The intensification of U.S.-China competition also benefits North Korea, as China is more willing to support North Korea, regardless of its behavior, in order to secure Pyongyang’s allegiance against the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, North Korea is dealing with a deepening economic crisis and poor health conditions, made more severe by the outbreak of Covid-19. These hardships also incentivize continued testing because displays of military prowess can help the regime boost loyalty and morale among the population during difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea faces a favorable environment for weapons development, with the United States focused on the war in Ukraine and China and Russia more closely aligned and unwilling to impose sanctions on North Korea following provocations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, North Korea’s continued military provocations serve to increase the possibility of drawing the newly elected Yoon administration and the alliance into a crisis that could lead to sanctions relief or other concessions desired by North Korea. Even absent a crisis, continued testing will increase North Korea’s potential bargaining leverage for an eventual return to diplomacy. Most experts agree that Pyongyang is not likely to return to diplomacy anytime soon. However, after North Korea is satisfied with its capability advancements, it may attempt to negotiate a testing moratorium in exchange for sanctions relief. Ending sanctions likely remains the top aim for Pyongyang. Among other things, it would relieve pressure on the regime following its ill-fated efforts to rebuild the economy through a path of “self-reliance,” which remains unlikely to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific capabilities to watch for in upcoming tests include continued nuclear testing (perhaps of a smaller, lighter weapon that could fit on top of a missile); multiple independent reentry vehicles (key to frustrating the missile defense systems of opponents); additional tests of submarine-launched ballistic missiles; and development of air-launched cruise missiles (an additional leg of a potential North Korean triad).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-core-strategic-principles-to-guide-north-korea-policy&quot;&gt;Building Core Strategic Principles to Guide North Korea Policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike President Biden’s China strategy, as elucidated by Secretary of State Antony Blinken on May 26, 2022, the administration has not provided a full public explication of its North Korea strategy. The classified policy review by the government completed in spring 2021 has not yet been presented in a speech or document. Nevertheless, some of the core tenets of the policy can be gleaned from statements by administration officials. First, the United States seeks complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Second, the basis of any policy is a position of strength based on enhanced military readiness and improved defense and deterrence capabilities. Third, the United States is not opposed to diplomacy; on the contrary, it is willing to engage “any time, any place, anywhere” with North Korea, without preconditions. The focus of diplomacy is not an “everything for everything” deal of the type sought by former president Donald Trump, though the United States is willing to pick up the themes laid out in the first Trump-Kim summit and the Singapore Declaration of 2018 (i.e., denuclearization, peace regime, normalization of political relations, and return of prisoners of war/missing in action [POW/MIA] remains). The administration is not continuing the “strategic patience” policies of non-dialogue during the Obama years. Instead, officials describe their policy as a pragmatic, calibrated approach based on substantive negotiations aimed at denuclearization. The current state of non-dialogue in the negotiations, resembling the Obama years, is not for lack of U.S. efforts but stems from the absence of interest from North Korea (reportedly, nearly 20 attempts have been made by the Biden administration). Fourth, Biden has not ruled out a meeting with the North Korean leader provided that it would cap a serious and substantive negotiation and deliverable. Fifth, the United States is open to humanitarian assistance that would help North Koreans, and this assistance would not be tied to progress on denuclearization. Sixth, the United States supports Japan’s desire for a satisfactory resolution of the abduction issue and a return to the Pyongyang Declaration of September 17, 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having assumed office only in May 2022, the newly elected Yoon administration outlined its “audacious” plan (담대한 구상/damdaehan gusang) for denuclearization in August 2022. First, the goal is the complete and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea. Second, South Korea seeks stronger military readiness with the United States and a bolstering of extended deterrence capabilities. Third, in achieving denuclearization, the government will undertake a “principled” approach that involves employing pressure for denuclearization and nonproliferation, as well as sanctions for human rights abuses in North Korea, but also offering North Korea economic benefits and political normalization. Related to the latter point, the fourth tenet is that South Korea supports a peace regime, but only as the exit point to diplomacy, not the entry point. Fifth, South Korea supports humanitarian engagement and a “green” détente in inter-Korean environment and ecology issues, separate from denuclearization negotiations. This includes the provision of food and medicine in return for minerals purchases, as well as support for transportation and energy infrastructure development in North Korea, with a firm commitment from Pyongyang to denuclearization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though offered in different frames, the Biden and Yoon approaches to North Korea share many similarities — more than between Biden and the previous South Korean government — in terms of the core goals of denuclearization, sanctions pressure, and bolstered defense and deterrence capabilities. At the May 2022 summit meeting, the two leaders demonstrated the overlap in their policies. As President Yoon noted in his opening remarks at the joint press conference following the summit meeting, “We, as the leaders of the two countries, reiterated our common goal of the complete denuclearization of the DPRK. There is no compromise for security. Under this shared belief, we concurred that strong deterrence against North Korea is paramount.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s disinterest in engagement should not discourage allied action. Whether diplomacy returns tomorrow or one year from now, the allies should internalize key strategic principles and map out policies going forward. With the election of the Yoon government, there is a moment of policy unity between Washington and Seoul that should be used to prepare for whatever actions Pyongyang may take in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;With the election of the Yoon government, there is a moment of policy unity between Washington and Seoul that should be used to prepare for whatever actions Pyongyang may take in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-on-north-korea&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations on North Korea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-principles&quot;&gt;Strategic Principles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following strategic principles should guide allied policies with respect to North Korea. Agreement on and internalization of these principles will ensure that, amid the coming unexpected twists and turns of diplomacy, crises, and even conflict, the two allies will remain focused on key common goals and preservation of a strong, united alliance. Straying from these principles for short-term gains is not in the mutual interests of Seoul and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ultimate policy objective is to achieve complete and irreversible denuclearization.&lt;/strong&gt; While there may be interim steps along the way, the two allies should work toward this final goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There should be no surprises between the allies.&lt;/strong&gt; The temptation to engage in and attain marginal benefits from secret bilateral negotiations with North Korea (part of Pyongyang’s tactics to split the U.S.-ROK alliance) should be weighed against the damage done to trust in the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The core of any negotiation strategy with North Korea is a strong alliance, measured in terms of readiness and defense and deterrence capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Neither ally should be willing to trade away alliance equities (e.g., cessation of military exercises) for short-term steps by North Korea. Strong U.S.-Korea-Japan trilateral policy coordination is an integral part of defense and deterrence capabilities. The allies should devise a range of actions to maintain the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence under shifting conditions (detailed further in the following section).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States and South Korea will support inter-Korean engagement that is accomplished in conjunction with steps on denuclearization.&lt;/strong&gt; While South Korea should have some leeway to pursue engagement with North Korea, both allies must internalize that there will be no true peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula without the removal of the nuclear threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States and South Korea will support humanitarian assistance and improved human rights in North Korea separate from denuclearization.&lt;/strong&gt; Such assistance, monitored by the international community, helps improve the human condition and conveys compassion and non-hostile intent on the part of the United States to the North Korean people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The core of any negotiation strategy with North Korea is a strong alliance, measured in terms of readiness and defense and deterrence capabilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The North Korean nuclear threat is a regional and global security problem.&lt;/strong&gt; While the United States and South Korea are key interlocutors, the nuclear threat engages the interests of all actors in the region, as well as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the United Nations. The allies should seek to engage new partners in the region and beyond who have the means and will to increase pressure on North Korea to denuclearize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China is a critical player on denuclearization, but the United States and South Korea should not depend on Beijing’s cooperation or cave to Chinese pressure tactics.&lt;/strong&gt; Given that China’s interests with respect to North Korea have increasingly diverged from those of the United States and South Korea, Chinese pushback should be anticipated and Beijing should not be expected to act with regard to anything but short-term self-interest and transactional politics. Allied actions to strengthen deterrence vis-à-vis North Korea will complicate China’s regional ambitions, potentially prompting Beijing to reconsider its permissive attitude toward Pyongyang’s provocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-north-korea-policies-pursuant-to-the-principles&quot;&gt;SPECIFIC NORTH KOREA POLICIES (PURSUANT TO THE PRINCIPLES)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because North Korea is unlikely to return to diplomacy until it achieves its weapons development goals, the United States and South Korea should pursue policies along three tracks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prepare for an eventual return to negotiations, with low expectations for short-term breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhance defense and deterrence capabilities and sanctions enforcement to both protect against North Korea’s growing threats and negotiate from a position of strength, if and when Pyongyang returns to dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicate positions on humanitarian assistance and human rights as separate from denuclearization diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prepare for an eventual return to negotiations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devise roadmaps toward complete and verifiable denuclearization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In pursuit of the goal of denuclearization, parties should consider interim steps that reduce the threat and build confidence among distrustful counterparts in the negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These interim steps could start with a missile (including long- and short-range options) and nuclear weapons test ban in return for partial sanctions lifting (with snapback clauses) and interim energy provision.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;While reaching an agreement on a test ban will not be easy, this interim goal is more achievable than other possible measures, such as a freeze on fissile material production that would require North Korean cooperation for verification.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a testing freeze is achieved, a separate but parallel political dialogue channel should be opened to address issues outside of the denuclearization negotiation, including mutual threat reduction, political normalization, the return of POW/MIA remains, and a peace regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The denuclearization channel should focus on next steps after the freeze, including the phased, verified shutdown and eventual disablement and dismantlement of key fissile material and nuclear weapons production facilities. This would be followed by declaration of fissile material and warheads in preparation for disablement, dismantlement, and removal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A separate negotiation should be instituted that focuses on missile technology control and inspection of undeclared North Korean missile bases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should consider a Nunn-Lugar-type program for scientific talent in North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should require China to carry its fair share of the costs associated with any energy assistance incorporated in a shutdown of North Korea’s programs and facilities, ensuring that China’s financial and reputational well-being are at stake with any North Korean noncompliance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signal openness to diplomacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should appoint a full-time special representative for North Korea. Even in the absence of negotiations, the envoy could work to coordinate potential roadmaps for North Korea’s denuclearization among key stakeholders in Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should continue to express a willingness to engage with North Korea. This could involve sending joint communications from senior envoys indicating a readiness to talk without preconditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhance defense, deterrence, and sanctions enforcement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen defense and deterrence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should resume joint military exercises to enhance military readiness. These have been suspended or downgraded as part of previous negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The allies should consider expansion of the scope and nature of exercises, particularly those elements that improve the extended deterrence commitment for dealing with a nuclear North Korea. These improvements need not be publicized.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The allies should not trade a cessation of military exercises for a reversible test ban by North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should support South Korea’s military improvements, including the “Kill Chain,” early deployment of Iron Dome, an additional Korean Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery, directed energy possibilities, and upgraded ship-based defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States should include South Korea in its efforts to develop an “all-in-one” sensor that would integrate listening, communicating, jamming, and injecting functions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States should move South Korea to the top of the list for purchase of a THAAD battery, given the urgency of the North Korean missile threat.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States should also consider potentially allowing South Korea to station some of its assets on U.S. bases, such as allowing South Korea to acquire and deploy dual-capable fighters in Guam, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should update their wartime operation plans, establishing new military directives to incorporate broader conflict scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S.-ROK space cooperation should be expanded in order to enhance reconnaissance capabilities to detect and deter North Korean threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should not under current circumstances redeploy U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula nor condone the acquisition of nuclear weapons by South Korea (the latter comports with the policy of the allied government).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Support for these policy options within South Korea is driven, in part, by doubts regarding the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence. This can be addressed through alternative policy initiatives that avoid the downsides of these options (detailed in the following section).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance counter-missile strategy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should develop a broad counter-missile strategy that focuses on detecting and defending against North Korean missiles and launchers, disrupting its capability networks, and destroying its launchers and missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an element of this strategy, the allies should strengthen missile defense coordination. This is essential given North Korea’s advances in its missile defense evasion capabilities and the legacy technologies that the United States currently relies on to counter the North Korean ICBM threat to the homeland.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should work to harden potential targets of North Korean missile strikes in South Korea, including critical infrastructure and other facilities in the greater Seoul metropolitan area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should also investigate new concepts of missile defense, such as boost-phase systems, in their nascent phases, which would help to overcome the limitations of current U.S. missile defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase trilateral defense cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States, South Korea, and Japan should reinstate the Trilateral Consultation and Oversight Group as a regular channel of communication and policy coordination on North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The three allies should consider additional forms of military cooperation to deter a nuclear North Korea, including information sharing, anti-submarine warfare, missile defense, contingency planning, and regular trilateral exercises to develop and demonstrate combined capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The three countries’ recent agreement to resume joint missile early warning exercises, which could include the interception of a dummy North Korean missile, is a step in the right direction.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To improve transparency, South Korea and Japan should engage in trilateral briefings about their respective defense improvement plans as well as developments related to extended deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bolster sanctions enforcement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea, together with Japan, should lead efforts to enforce existing sanctions on North Korea, including deterring illegal ship-to-ship transfers by North Korea and pressuring countries to return North Korean laborers working overseas in violation of international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should be ready to offer sanctions lifting but only for substantive and difficult-to-reverse steps on denuclearization by North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea must step up pressures on China and Russia to enforce UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) sanctions against North Korea, including trigger clauses in those resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should China and Russia not comply with UNSCRs, the United States should expand secondary sanctions against China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Increase support for humanitarian assistance and human rights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should consider immediate humanitarian assistance to North Korea through the international aid community to help improve the conditions for North Korean citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Covid-19 vaccines, cold-chain storage, personal protective equipment, and test kits are necessary to mitigate the current spread of Covid-19 inside of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The border lockdown, which has been in place for 33 months, has generated the need for additional assistance in food and medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should support the South Korean government’s proposal for a “green détente” dialogue with North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States must appoint a special envoy for North Korean human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should jointly advocate for North Korean human rights by co-sponsoring North Korean human rights resolutions in the United Nations and taking every available opportunity to speak up on this issue there and at other fora.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The two governments should also support NGO initiatives to increase the North Korean population’s access to outside information and enforce the implementation of existing human rights-related sanctions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-on-us-extended-deterrence&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations on U.S. Extended Deterrence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-present-and-future-of-extended-deterrence&quot;&gt;The Present and Future of Extended Deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. extended deterrence commitment to South Korea refers to Washington’s pledge to devote the full range of its military capabilities, including nuclear weapons, to deter and, if necessary, defeat an external attack on South Korea. It involves two central purposes: to deter North Korean aggression in all of its forms, and to prevent nuclear proliferation by providing South Korea with an alternative to developing its own nuclear weapons to meet its security needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This commitment has physical and psychological aspects that both affect its credibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Acquiring and demonstrating the military capabilities the United States needs to protect South Korea from North Korean threats is critical but insufficient. For extended deterrence to be effective, North and South Korea must also believe that the United States is willing to use these capabilities to defend its allies — even if it means risking Washington, D.C., or New York to save Seoul or Tokyo. As such, &lt;strong&gt;extended deterrence requires consistent U.S. demonstrations and assurances of both capabilities and will.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North Korea’s increasing weapons capabilities, its threats to use nuclear weapons for offensive purposes, and the vulnerability of U.S. national missile defense interceptors to North Korean multiple independent re-entry vehicle technologies have led the South Koreans to question the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence in recent years.&lt;/strong&gt; In general, doubts regarding the credibility of extended deterrence can be expected to grow whenever North Korea’s capability or will to attack South Korea or the U.S. homeland exceeds the United States’ (actual or perceived) capability or will to defend South Korea from an external attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future developments could further heighten doubts regarding the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, if a &lt;strong&gt;new U.S. administration&lt;/strong&gt; comes to power &lt;strong&gt;that does not place alliances at the center of its regional strategy&lt;/strong&gt; (similar to the Trump administration’s approach in questioning the need for U.S. troops in South Korea) &lt;strong&gt;or returns to a policy of strategic patience&lt;/strong&gt;, questions about the will of the United States to uphold its extended deterrence commitments will proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s growing military capabilities also loom in the background of this picture.&lt;/strong&gt; China’s military modernization efforts in recent decades have been a focus of U.S. regional policy writ large but not a target for U.S.-ROK deterrence policies on the Korean peninsula. This is because the perceived risk of China using its military to either invade South Korea directly or support a second North Korean invasion has been deemed to be low since the end of the Korean War. After all, an outbreak of militarized hostilities on the peninsula would significantly increase the chances of two destabilizing developments that Beijing seeks to avoid: U.S. troops mobilizing near the North Korea–China border and a severe humanitarian crisis on its doorstep. Even considering China’s increasingly unhelpful behavior with respect to North Korea since the start of the war in Ukraine, these general assumptions regarding China’s aversion to militarized hostilities on the Korean peninsula remain sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this could change if China perceived that renewed conflict on the peninsula had a good chance of severing, rather than unifying, the alliance. This would decrease the likelihood of U.S. troops on its border and open new possibilities for China to increase its influence on the peninsula. These types of hypothetical scenarios are on the minds of South Koreans as they consider the possibility that future U.S. administrations could downgrade the importance of alliances, thereby increasing the chance that South Korea will be left to fend for itself against North Korea and China. The relevance of Chinese military capabilities for South Korea’s security has also increased in recent years in light of Beijing’s increasing tendency to view Seoul’s defensive postures vis-à-vis North Korea as directed at China, showcased in its actions to punish South Korea for the THAAD battery deployment in 2017. There is a strong possibility that Beijing will use similar logic to argue that any future U.S. moves to improve U.S. national missile defenses against North Korea are actually efforts to deter China, thereby injecting broader concerns about strategic stability into the picture. These scenarios — both hypothetical and real — point to the need to factor the evolving significance of China’s military capabilities for the Korean peninsula into discussions about the future of extended deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-principles-1&quot;&gt;STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efforts to strengthen U.S. extended deterrence should be guided by an acknowledgement of its dual purpose (deterrence and nonproliferation) and nature (physical and psychological), as well as a firm understanding of the conditions that have caused, or are likely to cause, South Koreans or others to question its credibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The psychological question of how to build trust and belief in U.S. extended deterrence is a good place to start in devising new initiatives. After all, the issue that has perhaps the highest potential to divide the allies in the coming months — whether to redeploy U.S. tactical nuclear weapons on the peninsula — is driven more by psychological than by physical factors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Avoid policies that put the two purposes of extended deterrence into conflict, for instance, by advancing deterrence but setting back nonproliferation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure that policies designed to enhance credibility respond directly to the specific factors undermining credibility at that time and do not create new military dilemmas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The psychological question of how to build trust and belief in U.S. extended deterrence is a good place to start in devising new initiatives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New extended deterrence policies should not lose sight of the fact that the U.S.-ROK “community of fate” is and will remain at the heart of U.S. security commitments to South Korea.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “community of fate” refers to the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea that tie the country together with the United States strategically, ensuring that North Korea cannot use nuclear weapons or attack South Korea conventionally without killing Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This community of fate links events on the ground to the U.S. nuclear umbrella and makes it credible, thereby forming the core of extended deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anything the allies do to enhance extended deterrence should aim to build on the community of fate, not displace it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-extended-deterrence-policies-pursuant-to-the-principles&quot;&gt;SPECIFIC EXTENDED DETERRENCE POLICIES (PURSUANT TO THE PRINCIPLES)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies to strengthen U.S. extended deterrence should be pursued along six general tracks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public communications;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joint planning and execution;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trilateral discussions and operations;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. military adjustments and improvements;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pre-decisional groundwork to prepare for the possible future deployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coordinating positions on China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these efforts will help to bolster the psychological or physical aspects of extended deterrence, often simultaneously, by showcasing U.S. capabilities and will to uphold its commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide reassurance and clarification on existing and new U.S. capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should continue to broadcast at the highest levels its commitment to provide extended deterrence to South Korea using “the full range of U.S. defense capabilities, including nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities,” as President Biden did in the May 2022 U.S.-ROK Leaders’ Joint Statement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When referencing the “full range of U.S. defense capabilities,” the United States should emphasize that the U.S.-ROK “community of fate” — anchored in the presence of 28,500 U.S. troops on the peninsula — forms the core of extended deterrence, regardless of additional U.S. capabilities that may be introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public communications should acknowledge quiet alliance conversations about the potential redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons and possible preliminary measures (see point 5 below) while stressing that the allies would not commit to deployment without careful consideration of the downsides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improve joint planning and execution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should take a number of steps to improve joint planning and the execution of various aspects of extended deterrence, including:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Create a framework for joint nuclear planning. This would be similar to a NATO planning group for nuclear weapons use, with planning conducted bilaterally and trilaterally (with Japan) and control remaining in the hands of the United States. Experts see this as one of the most critical steps to developing stronger bonds of trust between the allies in the current environment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sustain practices such as sending a senior South Korean liaison officer to U.S. Strategic Command. This practice began a few years ago and gives South Korea a presence inside the key headquarters that plans for and executes any use of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reactivate the high-level Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group (EDSCG) as soon as possible. This will help in generating combined assessments of the risk of strategic deterrence failure and in setting policies that mobilize specific responses to these assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Streamline the protocols for direct Space-Based Infrared System access to South Korea in addition to the geographic commanders, as the United States does for Israel and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Revive track 1.5 unclassified dialogues in parallel with EDSCG meetings to incorporate a broader range of perspectives and potentially involve participants from Japan and other strategic partners, such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and France.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Potentially explore the prospects for multilateral nuclear umbrella guarantees by engaging other like-minded partners, such as the United Kingdom and France.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expand trilateral operations and discussions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should welcome new opportunities to bring together U.S.-Japan and U.S.-South Korea discussions and exercises related to extended deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Even though the state of the debate in Japan on options for strengthening extended deterrence is in a different place than in South Korea, the two countries should take advantage of the fact that they share concerns about the credibility of extended deterrence.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supplement the two extended deterrence dialogues with South Korea and Japan with a track 1.5 trilateral strategic exchange in order to stay informed about developments in each country and identify opportunities for coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States, South Korea, and Japan should look for ways to trilateralize operational activity that involves strategic assets, such as along the lines of Blue Lightning missions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should consider undertaking a nuclear planning exercise trilaterally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pursue U.S. military adjustments and improvements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should consider changing its regional strategic and nuclear posture to allow for more robust and constant demonstrations of its capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Specifically, this could entail the continuous presence in the region of either U.S. submarines equipped with nuclear cruise missiles or strategic bombers or investing in infrastructure in South Korea to receive U.S. dual-capable aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Regarding the relative value of different strategic assets, relying primarily on sea-based systems makes the most sense from an operational standpoint, while rotational deployments of dual-capable aircraft would have more political reassurance value than operational military significance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should improve its national missile defense capabilities vis-à-vis North Korea, including through accelerating its plans to deploy 20 additional interceptors equipped with Next Generation Interceptor technology, currently slated for 2028, and investing in boost-phase missile defense technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Both of these initiatives would enhance the United States’ capacity to deflect a North Korean attack on the U.S. homeland with nuclear-tipped missiles (deterrence by denial) while avoiding an unviable “numbers game” — involving a scramble to produce enough U.S. interceptors to match increasing numbers of North Korean launchers — that would ensue from continued reliance on old technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should continue its nuclear modernization efforts, including the Long Range Stand Off Weapon and B-21, and should not include the “no first use” or “sole purpose” clause in the upcoming Nuclear Posture Review.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States should also restore funds for and continue pursuing its nuclear sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM-N) program.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These efforts would help to reassure South Koreans — and convince North Koreans — of U.S. capabilities to fight and win a war against North Korea, thereby upholding deterrence by punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lay pre-decisional groundwork for possible redeployment of U.S. low-yield nuclear weapons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should consider tabletop planning exercises for the possible redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons to South Korea. This planning should be explicitly pre-decisional. The timeline and scope of weapons, such as low-yield nuclear SLCMs or gravity bombs, should be left deliberately ambiguous. Decisionmaking would be calibrated to shifts in the security environment and the North Korean threat level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such planning exercises could entail cumulative phases, including:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Studies of the environmental impacts of redeployment;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mapping of possible locations for facilities for storage;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Joint training on nuclear safety and security, including storage security, incident response, and recovery operations;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Certifying Korea-based U.S. F-16 units or F-35 replacements for combined exercises and nuclear missions; and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;More committal physical steps toward redeployment, such as building storage facilities — a process that could take a few years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The committal, physical steps would only be pursued if North Korean threat levels continued to escalate after other options to strengthen extended deterrence were exhausted (e.g., if North Korea intensifies its provocations even after the United States deploys nuclear SLCMs to the region, creates a joint nuclear planning framework, and ramps up its nuclear modernization efforts).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons could heighten tensions on the peninsula despite its intended deterrent effect. This type of pre-decisional preparatory framework would signal commitment to the allies and resolve to North Korea while not yet crossing the proliferation threshold. It would also create new pressure on North Korea to stop ratcheting up threat levels if it does not want to see U.S. tactical nuclear weapons return to the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coordinate positions on China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should establish a bilateral consultative mechanism to share assessments of the implications of China’s military capabilities for the Korean peninsula and coordinate potential responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should develop plans to jointly respond to Chinese pressure tactics aiming to derail allied deterrence initiatives directed toward North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should respond to any Chinese complaints about Washington’s efforts to strengthen its missile defenses against North Korea by highlighting the degree to which the U.S. homeland missile defense system is neither intended to nor capable of defending against ICBM capabilities as large and sophisticated as China’s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If China returns to a more helpful posture on North Korea issues, the United States and South Korea should consider incorporating Beijing into multilateral talks to secure China’s responsibility as a major stakeholder in North Korea’s denuclearization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea policy is famously known as the “land of lousy options.” Currently, North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs look unstoppable. Decades of failed denuclearization diplomacy, however, cannot deter the allies from seeking new avenues of engagement with the modest goal of slowing down the program’s growth. Failing that objective, the United States must be cognizant that contingency planning, enhanced military readiness, and strengthened extended deterrence measures with South Korea and Japan serve to make U.S. alliances in Asia stronger, which in turn impose costs on North Korea for its proliferation behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

CSIS developed a wargame for a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan and ran it 24 times.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;In most scenarios, the United States/Taiwan/Japan defeated a conventional amphibious invasion by China and maintained an autonomous Taiwan. However, this defense came at high cost. The United States and its allies lost dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and tens of thousands of servicemembers. Taiwan saw its economy devastated. Further, the high losses damaged the U.S. global position for many years. China also lost heavily, and failure to occupy Taiwan might destabilize Chinese Communist Party rule. Victory is therefore not enough. The United States needs to strengthen deterrence immediately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenge&quot;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s leaders have become increasingly strident about unifying Taiwan with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Senior U.S. officials and civilian experts alike have expressed concern about Chinese intentions and the possibility of conflict. Although Chinese plans are unclear, a military invasion is not out of the question and would constitute China’s most dangerous solution to its “Taiwan problem”; it has therefore justly become a focus of U.S. national security discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because “a Taiwan contingency is the pacing scenario” for the U.S. military, it is critical to have a shared, rigorous, and transparent understanding of the operational dynamics of such an invasion. Just as such an understanding was developed concerning the Cold War’s Fulda Gap, so too must analysts consider the Taiwan invasion scenario. This understanding is important because U.S. policy would be radically different if the defense were hopeless than if successful defense were achievable. If Taiwan can defend itself from China without U.S. assistance, then there is no reason to tailor U.S. strategy to such a contingency. At the other extreme, if no amount of U.S. assistance can save Taiwan from a Chinese invasion, then the United States should not mount a quixotic effort to defend the island. However, if U.S. intervention can thwart an invasion under certain conditions and by relying on certain key capabilities, then U.S. policy should be shaped accordingly. In this way, China would also be more likely to be deterred from an invasion in the first place. However, such shaping of U.S. strategy requires policymakers to have a shared understanding of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, there is no rigorous, open-source analysis of the operational dynamics and outcomes of an invasion despite its critical nature. Previous unclassified analyses either focus on one aspect of an invasion, are not rigorously structured, or do not focus on military operations. Classified wargames are not transparent to the public. Without a suitable analysis, public debate will remain unanchored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this CSIS project designed a wargame using historical data and operations research to model a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan in 2026. Some rules were designed using analogies with past military operations; for example, the Chinese amphibious lift was based on analysis of Normandy, Okinawa, and the Falklands. Other rules were based on theoretical weapons performance data, such as determining the number of ballistic missiles required to cover an airport. Most rules combined these two methods. In this way, the results of combat in the wargame were determined by analytically based rules instead of by personal judgment. The same set of rules applied to the first iteration and to the last iteration, ensuring consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on interviews and a literature review, the project posited a “base scenario” that incorporated the most likely values for key assumptions. The project team ran that base scenario three times. A variety of excursion cases then explored the effects of varying assumptions. The impact of these varying assumptions on the likely outcome is depicted in a Taiwan Invasion Scorecard (see Figure 8). In all, 24 iterations of the game mapped the contours of the conflict and produced a coherent and rigorously derived picture of a major threat facing the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-results&quot;&gt;The Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invasion always starts the same way: an opening bombardment destroys most of Taiwan’s navy and air force in the first hours of hostilities. Augmented by a powerful rocket force, the Chinese navy encircles Taiwan and interdicts any attempts to get ships and aircraft to the besieged island. Tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers cross the strait in a mix of military amphibious craft and civilian roll-on, roll-off ships, while air assault and airborne troops land behind the beachheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the most likely “base scenario,” the Chinese invasion quickly founders. Despite massive Chinese bombardment, Taiwanese ground forces stream to the beachhead, where the invaders struggle to build up supplies and move inland. Meanwhile U.S. submarines, bombers, and fighter/attack aircraft, often reinforced by Japan Self-Defense Forces, rapidly cripple the Chinese amphibious fleet. China’s strikes on Japanese bases and U.S. surface ships cannot change the result: Taiwan remains autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one major assumption here: Taiwan must resist and not capitulate. If Taiwan surrenders before U.S. forces can be brought to bear, the rest is futile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This defense comes at a high cost. The United States and Japan lose dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and thousands of servicemembers. Such losses would damage the U.S. global position for many years. While Taiwan’s military is unbroken, it is severely degraded and left to defend a damaged economy on an island without electricity and basic services. China also suffers heavily. Its navy is in shambles, the core of its amphibious forces is broken, and tens of thousands of soldiers are prisoners of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conditions-for-success&quot;&gt;Conditions for Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the 24 game iterations showed four necessary conditions to defeat a Chinese invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-taiwanese-forces-must-hold-the-line&quot;&gt;1. Taiwanese forces must hold the line.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Strengthen Taiwanese ground forces.&lt;/strong&gt; Because some Chinese forces will always land on the island, Taiwanese ground forces must be able to contain any beachhead and then counterattack forcefully as Chinese logistics weaken. However, the Taiwanese ground forces have severe weaknesses. Therefore, Taiwan must fill its ranks and conduct rigorous, combined arms training. Ground forces must become the center of Taiwan’s defense effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-there-is-no-ukraine-model-for-taiwan&quot;&gt;2. There is no “Ukraine model” for Taiwan.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: In peacetime, the United States and Taiwan must work together to provide Taiwan with the weapons it needs; in wartime, if the United States decides to defend Taiwan, U.S. forces must quickly engage in direct combat.&lt;/strong&gt; In the Ukraine war, the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have not sent troops directly into combat but have sent massive amounts of equipment and supplies to Ukraine. Russia has been unable to interdict this overland flow. However, the “Ukraine model” cannot be replicated in Taiwan because China can isolate the island for weeks or even months. Taiwan must start the war with everything it needs. Further, delays and half measures by the United States would make the defense harder, increase U.S. casualties, allow China to create a stronger lodgment, and raise the risk of escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-the-united-states-must-be-able-to-use-its-bases-in-japan-for-combat-operations&quot;&gt;3. The United States must be able to use its bases in Japan for combat operations.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Deepen diplomatic and military ties with Japan.&lt;/strong&gt; While other allies (e.g., Australia and South Korea) are important in the broader competition with China and may play some role in the defense of Taiwan, Japan is the linchpin. Without the use of U.S. bases in Japan, U.S. fighter/attack aircraft cannot effectively participate in the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-the-united-states-must-be-able-to-strike-the-chinese-fleet-rapidly-and-en-masse-from-outside-the-chinese-defensive-zone&quot;&gt;4. The United States must be able to strike the Chinese fleet rapidly and en masse from outside the Chinese defensive zone.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Increase the arsenal of long-range anti-ship cruise missiles.&lt;/strong&gt; Bombers capable of launching standoff, anti-ship ordnance offer the fastest way to defeat the invasion with the least amount of U.S. losses. Procuring such missiles and upgrading existing missiles with this anti-ship capability needs to be the top procurement priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;avoiding-a-pyrrhic-victory&quot;&gt;Avoiding a Pyrrhic Victory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victory is not everything. The United States might win a pyrrhic victory, suffering more in the long run than the “defeated” Chinese. Furthermore, the perception of high costs might undermine deterrence: if China believes that the United States would be unwilling to bear the high costs of defending Taiwan, then China might risk an invasion. The United States should therefore institute policies and programs to make winning less costly in the event of conflict. Such measures would include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;politics-and-strategy&quot;&gt;POLITICS AND STRATEGY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarify war plan assumptions. There is a seeming gap between war plans, which assume prewar deployments to Taiwan and neutral countries, and political realities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not plan on striking the mainland. The National Command Authority might withhold permission because of the grave risks of escalation with a nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognize the need to continue operations in the face of heavy casualties. In three weeks, the United States will suffer about half as many casualties as it did in 20 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Move Taiwanese air and naval forces toward asymmetry. Despite rhetoric about adopting a “porcupine strategy,” Taiwan still spends most of its defense budget on expensive ships and aircraft that China will quickly destroy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;doctrine-and-posture&quot;&gt;DOCTRINE AND POSTURE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortify and expand air bases in Japan and Guam. Dispersion and hardening dilute the effects of missile attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revise U.S. Air Force doctrine and restructure procurement to increase aircraft survivability on the ground. Ninety percent of aircraft losses occurred on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not plan on overflying the Chinese mainland. Chinese air defense is too strong, the targets take a long time to produce operational results, and the air missions around Taiwan take priority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognize the limitations of Marine Littoral Regiments and Army Multi-Domain Task Forces and cap their numbers. These units are designed to counter China and do provide some value, but political and operational difficulties put limits on their utility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Avoid crisis deployments that create vulnerabilities. Military doctrine calls for forward deployments to enhance deterrence during a crisis, but these forces make tempting targets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;weapons-and-platforms&quot;&gt;WEAPONS AND PLATFORMS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shift to smaller, more survivable ships and develop rescue mechanisms to deal with crippled ships and multiple sinkings. Surface ships are extremely vulnerable, with the United States typically losing two carriers and 10 to 20 large surface combatants in game iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prioritize submarines and other undersea platforms. Submarines were able to enter the Chinese defensive zone and wreak havoc with the Chinese fleet, but numbers were inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue development and fielding of hypersonic weapons but recognize that they are niche weapons. Their high cost limits inventories, so they lack the volume needed to counter the immense numbers of Chinese air and naval platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prioritize sustainment of the bomber fleet over fighters. The range, missile standoff distance, and high carrying capacity of bombers presented the People’s Liberation Army with daunting challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Produce more, cheaper fighters and balance the acquisition of stealth aircraft with production of non-stealth aircraft. With so many aircraft lost early in the conflict, the Air Force risks running out of fighter/attack aircraft and becoming a secondary player in the conflict unless it has a large enough force to sustain the losses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the project and its recommendations need some caveats. Modeling an invasion does not imply that it is inevitable or even probable. The Chinese leadership might adopt a strategy of diplomatic isolation, gray zone pressure, or economic coercion against Taiwan; even if China opts for military force, this might take the form of a blockade rather than an outright invasion. However, the risk of invasion is real enough and potentially so destructive that analysis is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project does not take a position on whether the benefits of defending Taiwan outweigh the prospective costs, or how to weigh those costs and benefits. Instead, the purpose is to enhance the public debate and thus allow the nation to make better-informed decisions on this critical national security challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-this-project&quot;&gt;Why This Project?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Need for Transparent Analysis of a Taiwan Contingency&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was once unthinkable — direct conflict between the United States and China — has now become a commonplace discussion in the national security community. The rise of China as an economic and military power, Beijing’s coercive policies directed against Taiwan and other U.S. regional partners in Asia, and growing U.S. bipartisan support for balancing Chinese economic and military power have created an intensifying competition. A direct clash would constitute the first between nuclear powers and also the first in which both sides possessed the full spectrum of modern military capabilities, such as stealth aircraft, long-range precision munitions, and space surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the high stakes involved, there is little publicly available material on how such a conflict might play out. Much is classified and unavailable to the public. Unclassified material is either incomplete or too narrow for policymaking. By investigating many scenarios with a wargame based on analysis and running the wargame 24 times, this project fills a critical gap and furthers the public discussion of three key questions: Would a Chinese invasion of Taiwan succeed in 2026? What variables most affect that outcome? What would be the cost to both sides?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-economic-and-military-rise&quot;&gt;China’s Economic and Military Rise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International relations scholars have long highlighted the dangerous dynamics between a rising power and an existing hegemon. In 1958, Abramo Organski first developed the notion that war becomes more likely as the capabilities of weaker, dissatisfied states approach those of the established, advantaged states. This theory provides the basis for a natural cycle of the rise and fall of hegemonic powers as unsatisfied and rising challengers defeat them. Graham Allison’s 2018 book about the “Thucydides trap” popularized this notion. The concern is that this theory applies to today, where a rising China challenges the hegemonic status that the United States has enjoyed since the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perception that China and the United States are strategic competitors, once debated, has gained widespread currency in both Washington and Beijing. In the United States, the sentiment has become bipartisan as hope has faded that China will become “a responsible member of the international community.” China’s attitude is hardening also. The two highest-grossing movies in Chinese history both featured the Chinese military taking on and defeating Americans (Wolf Warrior II and The Battle of Lake Changjin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view has been building over time. Andrew Marshall, the legendary head of the Office of Net Assessment, began warning about China in the late 1980s. Under President Barack Obama, the Pentagon launched the Third Offset Strategy to counter China’s growing capabilities, and in 2016, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter observed a “return to great power competition” in Asia. The Trump administration’s National Defense Strategy continued this view: “China is a strategic competitor using predatory economics to intimidate its neighbors while militarizing features in the South China Sea.” Most recently, the Biden administration’s National Security Strategy identifies China as the primary global competitor to the United States: “The PRC is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. Beijing has ambitions to create an enhanced sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and to become the world’s leading power.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has embarked on a concerted, long-term military modernization program. From its inception until the late 1990s, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was mainly land-focused, filled with masses of poorly trained conscripts, and unable to exert influence at a distance from its borders. Its poor performance in the 1979 border war with Vietnam underscored its weakness, as did the 1996 transit of the Taiwan Strait by U.S. naval forces. This has changed. As an annual assessment by the Department of Defense (DOD) notes: “The PRC has marshaled the resources, technology, and political will over the past two decades to strengthen and modernize the PLA in nearly every respect.” These capabilities have focused on air, naval, and missile systems that can target China’s periphery in a so-called anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s A2/AD capabilities are now formidable. China’s sizable and sophisticated force of ballistic and cruise missiles challenges the U.S. ability to operate from its few air bases in the Western Pacific, and China’s development of anti-ship ballistic missiles threatens to destroy U.S. surface ships. China began launching series production of fourth-generation fighter aircraft in the 2000s and now has more than 1,000 such aircraft in service. Series production of large modern warships (e.g., destroyers and frigates) did not begin until the mid-2010s, but progress since then has been even more striking. Between 2014 and mid-2020, China launched 25 Luyang III (Type 052Ds) destroyers and 8 Renhai cruisers. It is currently building its third aircraft carrier, which, at 80,000 tons, will be much larger than its first two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s A2/AD capabilities are now formidable. China’s sizable and sophisticated force of ballistic and cruise missiles challenges the U.S. ability to operate from its few air bases in the Western Pacific, and China’s development of anti-ship ballistic missiles threatens to destroy U.S. surface ships.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s 2021 annual report to Congress found that decades of improvements by China’s armed forces “have fundamentally transformed the strategic environment,” weakening military deterrence across the Taiwan Strait and diminishing the position of the United States. The commission concluded, “Today, the [PLA] either has or is close to achieving an initial capability to invade Taiwan — one that remains under development but that China’s leaders may employ at high risk — while deterring, delaying, or defeating U.S. military intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite impressive gains, China’s air and naval capabilities still lag behind aggregate U.S. capabilities in quality and breadth of capability. The fifth-generation aircraft of the PLA Air Force (PLAAF) suffer from the lack of a suitable domestically produced engine and have, therefore, only been produced in limited numbers. The PLA Navy (PLAN) lacks an adequate fighter for its carriers, and its submarine quieting technology remains immature. Despite recent growth, the sustainability and support capabilities of air-to-air refueling aircraft and amphibious warfare ships are limited. Perhaps most importantly, the PLA’s “software” (e.g., training, joint operations, and other human elements) is only beginning to adapt to the requirements of modern high-intensity warfare. PLA leaders are aware of and addressing all the organization’s weaknesses, and China watchers expect improvement in virtually all areas over time. Indeed, President Xi Jinping called for improving military readiness in his speech to the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, wars are not decided solely by aggregate or abstract capabilities. Geography generally favors China in the relevant scenarios. Taiwan’s coast is about 160 km (100 miles) from the Chinese mainland but more than 8,000 km from Honolulu and 11,000 km from San Diego. Flowing forces into the immediate theater would take far longer for the United States than for China. China also enjoys continental scale and strategic depth across which it can deploy or protect aircraft as battlefield needs dictate. The United States would be limited to a handful of air bases in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the United States benefits from maritime strategic depth, with the ability to operate from the more open spaces of the Western Pacific. Chinese naval forces would be more susceptible to detection in the confined seas adjacent to its territory. Perhaps most important, conducting an opposed amphibious assault is a hazardous and unforgiving undertaking under even the best of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwan-is-the-most-dangerous-us-china-flashpoint&quot;&gt;Taiwan Is the Most Dangerous U.S.-China Flashpoint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is widely regarded as the most dangerous potential flashpoint for conflict between the United States and China. In 1949, the nationalist government of China (under the Kuomintang party, or KMT) established an autonomous government on the island after being pushed off the mainland. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) thus regards Taiwan as a breakaway province with no legitimate claim to autonomy or independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China and severing diplomatic relations with Taipei is a precondition for any country to establish diplomatic relations with China. As leaders and officials in Beijing are fond of repeating, China has never foresworn the use of force against Taiwan. To make the point, China’s 2005 Anti-Secession Law outlines the circumstances under which China might employ force. A recent white paper by the Chinese Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council laid out the policy: “We are one China, and Taiwan is part of China. . . . We will work with the greatest sincerity and exert our utmost efforts to achieve peaceful reunification. But we will not renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all necessary measures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping’s report to the 20th Party Congress reiterated this policy: “Taiwan is China’s Taiwan. Resolving the Taiwan question is a matter that must be resolved by the Chinese. We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort, but we will never promise to renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlining this increasingly assertive attitude has been a practice of provocative military exercises. China increasingly flies masses of aircraft into the Taiwanese air defense identification zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese leaders have said they will not allow reunification to be postponed indefinitely, it is unclear what that means in practice. Much clearer is China’s commitment to demonstrating resolve when unwelcome events appear to move Taiwan further from unification — as China did with missile tests off Taiwan after President Lee Teng-hui visited the United States in June 1995 and recently with the military demonstrations during House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in the summer of 2022. The linkage of both events to the United States indicates the degree of U.S. involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Taiwan is China’s Taiwan. Resolving the Taiwan question is a matter that must be resolved by the Chinese. . . . we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary. — Xi Jingping&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has maintained a policy of strategic ambiguity to discourage China from attacking Taiwan while also discouraging Taipei from taking actions that might incentivize such an attack. This is also called dual deterrence, as it aims to deter China from invading Taiwan and deter Taiwan from declaring independence. In accordance with the Three Communiqués with China, in 1972, 1979, and 1982, and the U.S. “One China” policy, the United States maintains formal diplomatic relations with Beijing, not Taipei. Nevertheless, it nurtures historically deep cultural and economic ties with Taipei. Under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the United States provides weapons that Taiwan needs to defend itself, although the United States has no formal obligation to defend Taiwan directly. A variety of additional agreements, laws, and documents link the countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The historical relationship with Taiwan (now formally limited to economic and cultural engagement) creates a perception of obligation among many, a perception enhanced by Taiwan’s transition to vibrant democracy during the 1990s. Recently, President Joe Biden has sent clear deterrence signals to China without formally changing policy. When asked whether the United States was “willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that,” President Biden replied, “Yes, that’s the commitment we made.” President Biden has made such statements repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some members of Congress, wanting to strengthen U.S. support of Taiwan, have proposed the Taiwan Policy Act, which would provide direct military aid and enhance Taiwan’s diplomatic status. Although the act did not pass, it did show strong congressional support for Taiwan. As evidence of a closer military relationship, reports have emerged that the United States has military planning cells on Taiwan. Although these appear to be limited, they constitute a direct military relationship that has not existed since 1973.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing these leanings are official statements that U.S. policy has not changed. Indeed, the National Security Strategy reiterated the “One China” policy, as did a State Department statement. Further, there is a range of opinions within the United States on the wisdom of defending Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project does not take a position about whether the United States would or should become involved militarily in a conflict over Taiwan. It is enough to believe that, under certain conditions, the United States might intervene. An assessment of the outcomes of such an intervention is therefore valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;increasing-worries-about-an-imminent-chinese-attack&quot;&gt;Increasing Worries about an Imminent Chinese Attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior military officials have expressed concerns that China’s military might be preparing a military solution to the “breakaway province” problem — or preparing that capability in case called upon to act. Admiral Philip S. Davidson, commander of Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) until April 2021, testified that the Chinese threat to invade Taiwan “is manifest . . . in the next six years.” Current INDOPACOM commander Admiral John C. Aquilino, when asked for his opinion, stated that “this problem is much closer to us than most think.” Other military and civilian officials — for example, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Admiral Michael M. Gilday, chief of naval operations, and Admiral Charles Richard, head of Strategic Command — have expressed similar concerns. This is a broad narrative in the national security community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Senior military officials have expressed concerns that China’s military might be preparing a military solution to the “breakaway province” problem. . . . Others are more cautious . . . The project does not take a position on the likelihood of conflict but recognizes the possibility of conflict.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civilian writers echo these concerns. Recent articles in the New York Times, Foreign Affairs, and the defense trade press have highlighted Chinese assertiveness about Taiwan and the risks of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oriana Skylar Mastro, a Chinese specialist at Stanford University, observed, “In recent months there have been disturbing signs that Beijing is reconsidering its peaceful approach [to Taiwan] and contemplating armed unification. . . . Whereas Chinese leaders used to view a military campaign to take the island as a fantasy, now they consider it a real possibility.” Lonnie Henley, a retired defense intelligence officer for East Asia at the Defense Intelligence Agency, stated before Congress that, “if the political leadership turned to the [PLA] today and said, can you invade right now, it’s my assessment that the answer would be a firm yes.” Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow go further: “China is now in a prewar tempo of political and military preparations. We do not mean that we know that China is about to embark on a war. We simply observe that the Chinese government is taking actions that a country would do if it were moving into a prewar mode.” Taiwan itself has entered the debate, with its defense minister saying that China would be able to launch a “full-scale invasion” by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others are more cautious and stress that it is difficult to impute intentions from improving capabilities. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, addressed the statements made by other military leaders: “What Davidson and Aquilino and others have said is that Chinese capability to invade and seize the island of Taiwan is being accelerated to 2027, six years from now. I don’t dismiss that at all. . . but I don’t see it happening right out of the blue.” Christopher Johnson, a China scholar at CSIS, was more emphatic, saying that at the 2022 party congress Xi “held fast to the judgment that stability and economic growth continued to be dominant global trends” and that portrayals of Xi as “itching for war” were “overhyped.” Lonnie Henley qualified his own congressional testimony, writing separately:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I do not think they [the Chinese] will attack Taiwan as long as they believe unification without war remains a viable course of action. They will attack, however, despite the enormous cost and despite any doubts about their own military capabilities, if they judge that peaceful unification is no longer possible, that military force is the only remaining option. That in turn is driven by their assessment of political developments in Taipei and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy Heath similarly argues that “There is no evidence that the [Chinese] government is seriously contemplating abandoning its peaceful unification strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project does not take a position on the likelihood of conflict but recognizes the possibility of conflict. A CSIS study on surprise in war concluded that “wars happen” despite the dangers, uncertainty, and potential economic ruin. Nations miscalculate the military balance, get swept along in a crisis, feel that the balance of power is moving against them, or make national security choices based on domestic politics. As Colin Kahl, DOD undersecretary for policy, said: “I don’t think in the next couple of years that they’re likely to invade Taiwan, but you never know.” Although there is an ongoing debate about both Chinese capabilities and intentions, China’s determination to develop military options for use against Taiwan is widely accepted. A war over Taiwan is not certain, but it is not unimaginable either; for that reason, wargaming such a conflict is important for developing U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;parallels-and-differences-with-the-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Parallels and Differences with the War in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sparked a renewed interest in international conflict. The focus for the last generation has been on gray zone conflict and insurgency. The possibility of one country invading another to acquire territory seemed antiquated. Russia’s attack on Ukraine has reminded the world that cross-border invasions are possible. Speculation about a Chinese invasion of Taiwan was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A war over Taiwan is not certain, but it is not unimaginable either; for that reason, wargaming such a conflict is important for developing U.S. policy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are clear parallels between the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a possible Chinese attack on Taiwan. Russia and China believe that the target is not a sovereign state but a part of their country and should be reunited. Both are authoritarian (though of very different forms), and the target is democratic. In both cases, the United States and many global partners would support the potential victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also significant differences, including two that pertain directly to military deterrence. First, the United States has a longer and deeper history with Taiwan. It seems more committed to Taiwan’s defense than to that of Ukraine and, as discussed earlier, more likely to intervene directly. Second, the challenge to the Chinese military is much greater. It is harder to cross 160 km of water than to cross a land border, as Russia has done. Moreover, once a landing has begun, there is no going back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Views about how China sees the war in Ukraine have been highly speculative since China’s decisionmaking process is so opaque. Early on, the concern was that Russia’s success in Ukraine would embolden China. More recently, Russia’s military failure and the strong diplomatic reaction may discourage China. Regardless, the invasion has reminded everyone that irredentist policies are dangerous, that U.S. deterrence might fail, and that countries might do what they say they reserve the right to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations-of-currently-available-models-assessments-and-wargames&quot;&gt;Limitations of Currently Available Models, Assessments, and Wargames&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is a building sense of crisis about the Taiwan Strait, the ability of Chinese forces to achieve operational objectives has not been adequately studied in the public domain. Previous analyses largely include unclassified models focusing on one aspect of an invasion, seminar-type games that educate players but do not provide an adequate analytic foundation for policy recommendations, political-military games that primarily investigate diplomatic and political issues, or classified wargames whose assumptions and even results are not transparent to the public. All of these analytical efforts have value, but none can answer the central question of this project: can China conquer Taiwan in a military invasion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Views about how China sees the war in Ukraine have been highly speculative since China’s decisionmaking process is so opaque. . . . Regardless, the invasion has reminded everyone that irredentist policies are dangerous, that U.S. deterrence might fail, and that countries might do what they say they reserve the right to do.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;existing-unclassified-analyses-and-assessments&quot;&gt;Existing Unclassified Analyses and Assessments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars of military affairs and China have conducted several analyses and assessments that have contributed to understanding the military balance. These efforts have been invaluable resources for developing the project’s wargame. However, they do not purport to convert the data or insights into a wargame that would provide operational insights in a dynamic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution and a long-time military analyst produced an assessment of China’s prospects for invasion in 2000. The assessment was detailed and analytical, concluding that an invasion was not possible at that time. However, as detailed above, much has changed in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ian Easton’s 2019 book on the subject, The Chinese Invasion Threat, contains detailed information about geography and orders of battle but does not convert those into a model or wargame.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michael A. Glosny (2004), Bradley Martin et al. (2022), and O’Hanlon (2022) looked at a Chinese blockade of Taiwan rather than an amphibious invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stephen Biddle and Ivan Oelrich (2016) argue that surface ships will not be able to survive within 400 to 600 km of hostile coasts due to advances in A2/AD, but they do not go on to model an invasion of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S.-China Military Scorecard (2015), published by RAND, assessed many elements of a potential invasion over time and in depth, though without aggregating them into a unified analysis. One of its conclusions was the need for a wargame: “Perhaps the most direct follow-on to this study would be the creation of a unified model to assess the interrelationships between the different scorecards.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;wargames&quot;&gt;WARGAMES&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several organizations have conducted wargames that examine a possible U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan. However, their focus has been on escalation dynamics and politics rather than analysis of military operational outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2022, the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) worked with NBC’s Meet the Press to broadcast a wargame on a notational 2027 Chinese invasion of Taiwan and, in June, published a corresponding report, Dangerous Straits. These provided compelling and insightful examinations of the political and military issues related to such a conflict, especially prewar deterrence, alliance management, nuclear signaling, political messaging, and escalation management. However, these games were not focused on operational outcomes. Furthermore, the structure of the CNAS game restricted the exercise to a single iteration with a single set of assumptions and a single set of players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNAS conducted another game, described in a report, entitled The Poison Frog Strategy, developed from an earlier game exploring a Chinese seizure of Pratas Island/Dongsha Atoll and its international fallout. A game sponsored by Germany’s Körber Foundation, in cooperation with the United Kingdom’s Chatham House, examined the potential European response to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The two games — CNAS and Körber — were similar in that they were single-instance seminar games that focused heavily on political issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters published an investigative report that was termed a wargame. The report presented several policy and governmental scenarios to describe possible escalatory paths for China and Taiwan. While this report was not a game in the customary sense, it did present several plausible scenarios based on expert opinions and illustrated its findings with excellent graphics. The report was also a good example of how broadly the term “wargame” is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these games provided useful policy insights. However, wargames specifically about military operational outcomes are needed as a complement. Unfortunately, all such wargames hitherto have been in the classified realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lack-of-transparency-from-classified-wargames&quot;&gt;Lack of Transparency from Classified Wargames&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD has done much internal wargaming on a U.S.-China conflict, but the results are classified, with only a few details leaking out. These details hint at heavy casualties and unfavorable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in a widely cited commentary, David Ochmanek, a senior RAND analyst, noted, “In our games, when we fight Russia and China, [the United States] gets its ass handed to it.” Michele Flournoy, former undersecretary of defense for policy, similarly stated, “The Pentagon’s own war games reportedly show that current force plans would leave the military unable to deter and defeat Chinese aggression in the future.” Another report noted that a “secret wargame” showed that the United States could prevail in the conflict with China, but at the risk of causing nuclear escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding another wargame, General John E. Hyten, then-vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, “[The U.S. warfighting concept] failed miserably. An aggressive China team that had been studying the United States for the last 20 years just ran rings around us.” This happened, at least in part, because “the blue team lost access to its networks almost immediately.” Unclear was what sort of cyberattack caused this loss of capability or what the China team did to “run circles” around the U.S. team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2021, Lieutenant General S. Clinton Hinote, the deputy chief of staff, strategy, integration, and requirements, headquarters, said that for over a decade, U.S. Air Force wargames had indicated that the Chinese were investing in military capabilities that would make the Air Force’s preferred model of expeditionary warfare “increasingly difficult.” “The trend in our wargames was not just that we were losing, but we were losing faster,” he said. He told reporters, “The definitive answer if the U.S. military doesn’t change course is that we’re going to lose fast. In that case, an American president would likely be presented with almost a fait accompli.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these examples indicate, these hints from the classified world do not specify the parameters of the games, including basic information such as when the war occurs, or the conditions and assumptions incorporated into the game. Many DOD wargames are set far in the future — not infrequently 20 years in the future — to grapple with future acquisition questions that often play out over decades. References to losses or challenges may not refer to operational outcomes, such as which side achieved its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not surprising since those wargames are classified, and the restrictions are intended to keep sensitive data from potential adversaries. However, restrictions on describing game parameters make it impossible for outsiders to judge why the outcomes occurred, whether the game assumptions were reasonable, and whether alternative assumptions might produce different outcomes. Further, many of the reported results appear self-serving, as they support programs favored by the wargaming agency. Classified wargames also often focus on challenging cases, even if those cases are not particularly likely, to test the limits of the U.S. military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without transparency and independent assessment of the assumptions, it is impossible to judge a game’s credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-for-a-wargame-examining-operational-outcomes&quot;&gt;The Need for a Wargame Examining Operational Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project fills a void in the literature by providing an unclassified analysis of operational outcomes if China attempted to invade Taiwan. This is important for three reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is disagreement about whether a defense of Taiwan could be successful. Any policy discussion must begin with baseline assumptions and resulting outcomes against which to measure change. The nature of the policy discussion depends heavily on the baseline. If China can take Taiwan in a day, that produces a different discussion than if Taiwan can hold out for weeks while the United States and its partners deploy forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, by examining a wide variety of scenarios, the project can provide insights into the most important conditions for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the project provides the necessary descriptions and data for the broader national security community to discuss these critical issues of war and peace, deterrence, and national commitment. The Pentagon’s classified wargames do not help this broader discussion. Decisions relating to the defense of Taiwan are not just technical but involve judgments about values, priorities, and trade-offs. This project facilitates that discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This project fills a void in the literature by providing an unclassified analysis of operational outcomes if China attempted to invade Taiwan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-the-project-does-not-do&quot;&gt;What the Project Does Not Do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the project assesses the prospects of a Chinese military invasion of Taiwan, it does not investigate other strategies that might be attractive. For example, China might blockade Taiwan and try to achieve its goals without an amphibious assault and all the attendant risks. Similarly, the United States might avoid a direct military confrontation but instead blockade China, intending the long-term pain to force the Chinese government to relinquish its gains. In some instances, the players might want to use nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China might bombard Taiwan for an extended period before launching an attack. This would allow China to isolate Taiwan, grind down Taiwan’s air and naval forces, and assemble a fleet of merchant ships to act as decoys and “missile sponges” in an attack. The historical analogy would be German air attacks on Great Britain in the summer of 1940. Even though the ocean barrier was narrow, Germany recognized that risks were great if opposing air and naval assets still operated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each alternative approach has strengths and weaknesses. All entail less military risk and might be more attractive to a cautious Chinese leadership. The project does not take a position on what action is most likely. Indeed, there is no certainty that China will undertake any military action at all. However, invasion is the most dangerous threat to Taiwan and is thus the first course of action that needs to be analyzed, hence the relevance and importance of the current project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teams play as military command authorities rather than civilian commanders in chief. Thus, there is no political and nuclear decisionmaking within each game iteration by the teams. However, varying the structure of scenarios allows analysis of some alternative approaches in these areas. (The variables are discussed in detail in Chapter 5). For example, in some scenarios, concerns about nuclear escalation led to rules of engagement prohibiting the United States from attacking the Chinese mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the project does not make recommendations about U.S. Taiwan policy. This project assessed the potential costs of maintaining Taiwan’s autonomy but does not examine the benefits. Many commentators note the moral value of preserving a democracy of 23 million people and that a China-controlled Taiwan would complicate the defense of regional allies, including Japan and South Korea. An evaluation of U.S. policy requires an assessment of benefits and costs that is beyond the scope of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphic below shows how the current analysis fits into a broader assessment of U.S.-Chinese relations. It is an important element but only one aspect of such an assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The project does not make recommendations about U.S. Taiwan policy. . . . [Such an] evaluation of U.S. policy requires an assessment of benefits and costs that is beyond the scope of this project.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wargaming-as-a-method&quot;&gt;Wargaming as a Method&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project sought to produce a wargame that was transparent and analytically sound, such that decisionmakers and the public could use it to make decisions about policy. This chapter discusses the design decisions intended to produce such a game. A list of relevant terms and their definitions is in Appendix B, which details relevant wargaming lexicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When analyzing military affairs, there has been a historical tension between quantitative modeling and qualitative judgments. Wargaming offers one tool to combine these two approaches. For a wargame aimed at analysis (instead of participant education or other purposes), quantitative models provide the best tools to base adjudications on because of their transparency and rigor. The decisionmaking of players adds human judgment to the interaction of these quantitative models, allowing for plausible sequences of events to be explored. To aggregate models and human decisionmaking in a structured way that addresses uncertain assumptions, analytic wargames should be varied and iterated. The results of a series of wargames thus constructed offer insights into the distribution of outcomes for a future conflict and how key variables impact this distribution. While it is not predictive, it provides data on plausible outcomes and facilitates informed analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quantitative-models-vs-qualitative-judgments&quot;&gt;Quantitative Models vs. Qualitative Judgments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first decision in beginning an assessment of a hypothetical future conflict is whether to use quantitative models, qualitative judgments, or some combination of the two. To assess the complex set of operations that would constitute an invasion of Taiwan, wargaming offers a good mix of rigor and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to analyze the future relies on judgments about uncertainty. This is especially true for warfare, which is chaotic and contingent on chance. For example, although there have been amphibious landings before, they are too few to generate quantitative models allowing for statistical confidence. Even issues of weapon performance, which should be the most amenable to analysis based on testing and modeling, require some judgment because such testing is conducted under peacetime conditions; there is, for example, no real-world data on the performance of a Chinese YJ-12 anti-ship cruise missile against an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. This uncertainty is only magnified when trying to appraise key factors such as the relative morale and training of forces. Every analysis of future war must therefore approach the problem with humility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty aside, there are more basic analytic faults or pitfalls to be avoided. First are physically impossible faults: a prediction about a U.S.-China war that has 30 Ford-class carriers in the 2026 U.S. order of battle (OOB) is not factual. Second are faults that are physically possible but that overlook operational history, such as by having all 11 Ford-class carriers show up in a U.S.-China war without factoring some of them being in deep maintenance. While it is physically possible for the United States to have all 11 Ford-class carriers ready, such an analysis is less plausible than an analysis that accounts for historical factors, such as maintenance cycles and operational readiness. Most reasonable analytic disagreements occur in this space. Third is inflexibility about variation in assumptions: for example, ignoring the amount of warning available to the United States would miss important variation in how many carriers show up, where, and when. Any analysis based on one model or wargame would have difficulty addressing this problem. Fourth, analysis might restrict variables to quantifiable factors without exploring human decisionmaking: a model that has all carriers charge into the fight without concern for losses or changing tactics would ignore the human decisionmaking critical in warfare. Finally, analysis that is not transparent is impossible to dissect and debate. When considering methods of analysis and comparing them, all these factors must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most basic ways in which future conflicts are analyzed involves unstructured or loosely structured judgments. Unstructured judgments usually refer to sources about the relative strength of the concerned militaries and postulate a course of events, possibly based on analogy to an episode from military history. Loosely structured judgments may follow from simple quantitative comparisons (e.g., the total size of the contending militaries or the number of combat aircraft) that lack a structured assessment of how forces might interact dynamically over relevant time and space. While such judgments are easy to make, they allow little basis for discussion and lack replicability. When one person’s judgment conflicts with another’s, there is little ground for resolution. This leads to the requirement for methods of structured judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods of structured judgment, such as net assessment or the mission planning process, are helpful because they ensure that critical variables are not overlooked, and they allow for debate and scrutiny. For mission planning, junior officers in the U.S. Army and Marine Corps are taught the METT-TC mnemonic (Mission, Enemy, Terrain, Troops, Time, Civilians) to avoid forgetting critical factors. There are many similar and more complicated planning processes across the services that all aim to structure judgment about a military situation. Net assessment, although usually used for strategic and longer-term evaluations, represents another methodology that is less rigid than military mission planning but still structured. For example, Eliot Cohen describes net assessment as “the appraisal of military balances” that operates through examining five critical questions. Cohen contrasts net assessment with quantitatively oriented methods of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military forces can also be analyzed with quantitative models. A model is “a mathematical or otherwise logically rigorous representation of a system or a system’s behavior.” While even loosely structured judgments may use numbers to support their argument, modeling adds rigor and transparency to these numbers and their interactions. Former secretary of defense Robert McNamara formalized the use of systems analysis in the DOD, principally to better inform the acquisitions process. During the Cold War, unified models (e.g., TACWAR and CEM) were developed to assess entire theater campaigns. These employed representations of ground attrition and movement, supplemented by simple calculations about the support provided by airpower. Some current campaign models (for example, JICM and STORM) incorporate sophisticated interactions and can employ imposing wills. However, all their results are classified and only run once, thus rendering them unsuitable for public discussion and sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While modeling of future conflicts can be done under the umbrella of systems analysis, in the scholarly community it is usually conducted in the framework of campaign analysis. Campaign analysis is “a method that involves the use of a model and techniques for managing uncertainty to answer questions about military operations.” While campaign analysis has been practiced by many scholars over the last several decades, it has recently been formalized by Rachel Tecott and Andrew Halterman. The essence of campaign analysis is specifying a scenario, building a model based on historical data, running that model, and analyzing the model for sensitivity to variation. Campaign analysis is particularly suited to studying questions of sufficiency, such as the adequacy of certain force postures to succeed in a particular military operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, this difficulty contributed to debate between Cohen, who supported a broader framework of net assessment to address these and other uncertainties, and John Mearsheimer and Barry Posen, who supported using campaign analysis to evaluate specific operations analysis. Ideally, conflict analysis would combine the rigor and transparency of campaign analysis with human decisionmaking. One way to do this is with wargaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;different-wargames-for-different-purposes&quot;&gt;Different Wargames for Different Purposes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While wargaming has a long history, its relationship to analysis and military decisionmaking is still unsettled. Wargames are increasingly used as pedagogic and research tools at universities, think tanks, and government agencies to examine security questions from crisis stability to regional conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite calls to increase the use of wargaming in policy analysis, it is often unclear what such usage should look like and how it best aids the national security debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current debate on the utility of wargames centers around their purpose. Experimental wargames aim to better understand human decisionmaking in a specific context. Educational wargames aim to foster decisionmaking simulations for military and political elites. Finally, analytic wargaming aims to analyze a military problem to better inform policy. Each of these represents a path that this project might have followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimental wargaming aims to aid political scientists in the study of decisionmaking processes, particularly in international relations. Political science’s emphasis on experimentation and the desire to understand the micro-level processes of international wargames have led to the exploration of experimental wargaming. For example, Erik Lin-Greenberg conducted a series of wargames while varying whether a drone or a manned aircraft were shot down and, if a manned aircraft were shot down, what happened to the pilot. By manipulating a key variable and recording the discussions that ensued, the experimental wargame shed light on the ways that losses of drones might affect escalation risk differently than the losses of manned aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educational wargaming aims to prepare leaders for decisionmaking in war. In the words of Peter Perla, “The choice of the best weapons and the men who will skillfully employ them is a major concern for the military and the nation. Wargames and wargaming are important tools for helping to sort through such choices.” In another formulation, Perla and McGrady write that wargaming’s strength is “its ability to enable individual participants to transform themselves by making them more open to internalizing their experiences in a game.” Francis J. McHugh argued for a subdivision between wargames that provide military commanders with decisionmaking experience and those that provide decisionmaking information. For example, playing a game about Napoleonic warfare might give contemporary military commanders decisionmaking experience, without giving them decisionmaking information about the war that they might have to fight in the future. Educational wargaming might therefore be subdivided into “experiential,” focusing on providing decisionmaking experience, and “current operations-oriented” games that focus on decisionmaking information. Regardless, educational wargames broadly favor the development of players over the use of wargames as analytic tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, analytic wargames exist to provide data about a specific problem that can be analyzed. Jon Compton has been the main proponent of this approach, calling for wargamers to take analytical ownership of national security problems. To do this, he argues for an analytic architecture that builds models based on evidence, which then feed into a wargame design that is vetted by subject matter experts; this game is then played iteratively by a small group of people to facilitate analysis. The use of quantitative models (in the sense of those used in campaign analysis) in wargames has not been a feature of many DOD wargames, causing some debate within the DOD wargaming community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crux of contemporary debate on wargaming centers on whether educational wargames are more helpful than analytic wargames for the national security enterprise. While both sides decry wargames that are a “bunch of guys sitting around a table,” they disagree on how to move forward. Perla advanced the idea of a “cycle of research” that integrates wargaming, analysis, and military exercises to illuminate the decisions, data, and actions relevant to contemporary warfighting. That is, wargames raise questions which are then to be explored through military exercises and mathematical analysis. Perla and co-authors reiterated the belief that wargaming could not take analytical ownership of a problem but that it should be mutually constitutive with exercises and analysis in informing policymakers, who would themselves own the problem. In line with Perla, McGrady argues that wargames function best as a storytelling device and not as a method of analysis. In riposte, Compton has written a fictional juxtaposition of his method with seminar-style educational wargaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the view of this report’s authors, different wargame purposes are not better or worse than others; the problem arises when a wargame is designed for one purpose but employed for another. When a wargame is designed to educate participants but is used as a basis of analysis, it results in wasted effort and faulty conclusions. The debate is not entirely a matter of misperception; some wargamers believe that wargames cannot serve certain purposes. Despite these disagreements, all agree that aligning the structure of a wargame to the purpose of a project is a key step in any wargaming effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;principles-of-analytic-wargaming&quot;&gt;Principles of Analytic Wargaming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this project — to analyze the dynamics of a conventional invasion of Taiwan by China — led CSIS’s efforts to follow Compton’s analytical wargaming approach. The project does not purport to predict the future with certainty. However, the large number of game iterations, the variation of scenarios, and the adjudication based on evidence-based rules mean that policymakers and the public can reasonably use the range of outputs for making judgments about warfighting dynamics and policy choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating methods of campaign analysis with Compton’s suggestions for analytic wargaming, this wargame:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Used a variety of methods to create evidence-based models that determined adjudication;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrated several models across domains to examine a campaign;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conducted many iterations with varied strategies by both sides;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Varied key assumptions to examine their impacts on the outcome;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Used players to account for human decisionmaking, explore many plausible pathways, and to inject variation into scenario outcomes; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nested the wargame in broader analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-the-method-of-history-and-the-method-of-pks-to-create-evidence-based-rules&quot;&gt;Using the Method of History and the Method of Pks to Create Evidence-based Rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important factor in making an analytic wargame generate plausible outcomes is for the rules to be based on empirical data. The rules of educational wargames do not have to conform to reality in order to teach students about strategy. However, rules are how analytic wargames model reality. As mentioned above, it is impossible for the rules to be entirely certain because of the paucity of real-life cases of twenty-first century warfare. However, wargames based on rigorous modeling that recognizes physical constraints and operational realities will generate analytically valid insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two broad approaches to creating models: the method of history and the method of Pks. This project used both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method of history models the results of future military operations by making analogies with past military operations at the appropriate level of analysis. For example, this may include using the sorties per day of aircraft from Desert Storm to project the sortie rate per day of aircraft in a future conflict or allowing players to move land forces based on historical advance rates. This approach is popular both in campaign analysis and in commercial wargaming. Dunnigan, in a foreword to Perla, argues: “Basically, you obtain good games by paying attention to past experience (history) and letting the chips fall where they may.” However, history is not self-explanatory, and analogies can be misleading. A key question is one posed by Barry Posen: “What is this a case of?” For example, modeling the rate of advance for an infantry unit in urban terrain during heavy combat on a historical breakthrough operation by a mechanized force across plains would be inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pks method models the results of future military operations by assigning probabilities and values to the weapons systems and aggregating these capabilities up to the appropriate level. “Pks” means the probability of kill, a common measure of theoretical weapon efficacy. Every military operation is the result of an infinite number of micro-level interactions, such as the detection of enemies, the employment of weapons, and the result of a hit. While every interaction cannot be modeled, the method of Pks tries to model the likely effects of major weapons and their effects. This is more suited for air, naval, and missile combat than for ground combat. Data about the probabilities of detection, weapon hits, and weapons effects can be taken from historical data or weapons testing data. In the absence of better evidence, values can be taken from subject matter experts. These probabilities can be calculated separately or aggregated into a cumulative “probability of kill,” or Pk. With these values in hand, researchers model individual interactions, then aggregate the results of these interactions to the appropriate level for the analysis (e.g., individual dogfights, meetings between two aircraft flights, or even squadron-on-squadron engagements). Games conducted during the interwar period at the Naval War College addressed this problem by modeling “hit probabilities,” derived from real-world tests with bomber aircraft and warship guns, and then embedding those models into the larger operational wargames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method of history and the method of Pks both have strengths and weaknesses. The method of history does a good job of ensuring that models account for operational realities: allowing a tank battalion to advance according to the maximum speed of a tank, for example, ignores the operational reality that it is much harder to organize and direct an armored force. The method of history deals with problems of aggregation and unknown factors by getting plausible values at the appropriate level of analysis. In contrast, the method of Pks struggles to deal with these operational factors and cannot account for unquantifiable factors such as morale and friction. However, the method of history is not as good at accounting for changes in weaponry and technology or situations that lack good analogies; in contrast, the method of Pks excels here. For example, there is no historical precedent for mass precision-guided tactical ballistic missile attacks against defended targets that would allow the method of history to work. The method of Pks can be used to extrapolate upward from historical cases of single ballistic missile launches and from testing data on interceptors. The mixed virtues and vices of these methods means that researchers must be aware of and use each as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;anti-ship-missile-interception&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Anti-ship Missile Interception&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How frequently do anti-ship cruise missiles hit their targets? This project combines the methods of history and Pks to generate rules that are rigorous and evidence based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First, based on missile attacks in Desert Storm, the project team estimates that 15 percent of missiles either fail to launch or otherwise malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The project team assumes that defenders will have sufficient warning to launch interceptors. The curvature of the earth restricts a radar on a 15-meter mast from seeing a missile skimming 5 meters above the sea until the missile is 20 kilometers from the ship. Depending on the tactical situation, the defending ships might also have airborne early warning (AEW) or organic helicopters to aid in initial detection. This project judges that this initial detection is sufficient to alert the crew, but that the defenders only have one engagement opportunity against a supersonic cruise missile traveling at approximately 2,400 km/hr. They would launch two interceptors in a salvo against each incoming missile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The project team further estimates that each interceptor launched by the defender has a 70 percent chance of hitting an incoming anti-ship cruise missile. While this number is supported in a variety of sources, it does strike the authors as optimistic. One excursion case explores what would happen if missile interception were not as effective. With two interceptors launched at each supersonic anti-ship cruise missile, there is therefore a 91 percent chance that at least one interceptor will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Next, the project estimates that 10 percent of anti-ship missiles will experience terminal guidance failures. This 10 percent miss rate is taken from the historical record showing that 8.7 percent of anti-ship cruise missiles have missed undefended civilian targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, terminal interception and electronic warfare will have a combined 70 percent effectiveness, based on historic attacks against military ships without interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The project aggregates these probabilities into a table for game play. This combines the 15 percent failure to launch, 91 percent chance of success with interceptors, 70 percent effectiveness of terminal defense and electronic warfare, and 10 percent miss rate. The team further adds on two “fat-tails”: a 5 percent chance that the attacker has made a catastrophic error (e.g., gross target location error) and a 5 percent chance that the defender has made a catastrophic error (e.g., no AEW is overhead, or the crew does not react in time). This generates the table below. For each salvo of 25 incoming supersonic cruise missiles, a 20-sided dice is rolled against the table to determine the number of “leakers,” or missiles that hit ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IIvm8gk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Interception of Supersonic Anti-ship Cruise Missiles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a simple demonstration, 24 Chinese H-6 bombers launch a total of 96 YJ-12 supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles (grouped into four missile “salvoes” of 25 missiles each) at a U.S. surface action group of two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and a Ticonderoga-class cruiser. Rolling four 20-sided dice (one for each salvo) shows: 13, 3, 15, and 2. Referencing the table, three missiles leak through and hit U.S. ships. The project team assigns the hits randomly, this time getting that one missile hits each ship. This U.S. surface action group is now combat ineffective with all its ships either sunk or not mission capable. This serves as a good illustration how, even using optimistic assumptions, it is very hard to defend surface ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the method of Pks or history is used, these models can provide a grounding for plausible rules about combat. For example, a model of the result of two squadrons of aircraft can be used to generate a table of possible outcomes for such a combat in the game. A table of probable outcomes is preferable to a deterministic result because of the fat-tailed nature of combat results throughout history. Throughout this paper are examples of models and how they determined rules in the wargame. Most models for campaign analysis need only be aggregated (or disaggregated) to a level appropriate for a wargame. In that form, the wargame can serve to interact these models in an appropriate way for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;model-interactions&quot;&gt;MODEL INTERACTIONS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transparency of modeling enables observers to review and vet models but requires a certain degree of simplification. This is easier to achieve when modeling a single domain (e.g., a ground campaign or air campaign) or when the variety of engagement types is limited (e.g., a submarine campaign involving passage through an acoustic barrier followed by ship hunting). As the variety of engagement types increases, the complexity of models may increase geometrically, and the difficulty of clear exposition and vetting will grow proportionately. This is true even when strategy, or the allocation of assets to particular tasks, is held constant throughout the model “run.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does the number of sub-routines increase when modeling a menu of operations within a single campaign, but decision rules also increase. When modeling a single type of interaction, there may be no need for the model to reallocate resources to new tasks. When modeling an air superiority campaign, for example, combat aircraft will remain allocated to the air superiority task (e.g., through offensive counter-air) for the duration of the model “run.” In cases where two tasks might be possible, a model can apply simple algorithms. So, in the preceding example, a model might assume that when a greater than 2:1 superiority is achieved in the number of aircraft “on station” in the air superiority fight, any additional aircraft will be dedicated to another task, such as ground support. However, such algorithms can quickly add complexity when they become numerous, which may ultimately undermine transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these issues, most campaign analyses have addressed the critical portions of larger campaigns. While it is possible to model operations down to the size of boots worn by each soldier, such a level of complication would be unlikely to shed light on the course of the wider campaign. However, precision is not the same as accuracy. The modeler relies on their judgment and the literature to identify which areas demand precision, and which can be treated abstractly. With these areas identified, they can be modeled in turn. RAND’s U.S.-China Military Scorecard, for example, contains chapters that address 10 critical aspects of the larger U.S. China competition, but it does not attempt to knit them together into an overarching whole. In the academic domain, too, there have been several attempts to model individual aspects of conflict in Asia but no attempts to model an entire conflict, despite the fact that China is the so-called “pacing threat” for the United States. Wargaming can help with this holistic modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, wargames do not inherently require different models. A basic wargame might have players control only one type of force, such as aircraft. All aircraft need not be similar, but they need to operate within the framework of the same model, which would specify an attrition rate that occurs when different types of aircraft meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, such a basic wargame is appropriate only if the chosen pieces are the only significant parts of a conflict. Surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) are a critical element of contemporary air combat; a wargame or model of air combat that failed to account for SAMs would be incomplete. The same is true of major surface combatants, which largely function as floating SAMs. But if surface combatants are included, then the major ways in which they can be attrited must also be included: other surface ships, submarines, and anti-ship missiles. This produces a complex system wherein dozens of models must interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytic wargaming allows models to interact in an intelligent way. The models-based rules create grounds for adjudicating the results of various interactions, from what happens when an aircraft squadron flies into an SAM to the likelihood that a submarine sinks a surface ship. The specific events that generate scenarios for adjudication come from intelligent decisionmaking from human players. An attempt to simulate an entire war as an ensemble of models would likely see extreme results from actions that humans would recognize as blunders. For example, one could model aircraft attacking ships with the longest-range munition they have, while ships defend themselves with their longest-range munition. At some point, the aircraft run out of their longest-range missiles, while a significant inventory of the ship’s longest-range missiles remains. The merciless logic of the model drives the aircraft into the ships to be completely annihilated; an intelligent player on a wargame would redirect the aircraft to a different target. A wargame allows for some check on these interactions. Furthermore, analytic wargaming allows for flexibility with an inherently modular approach to modeling conflict. Depending on the operations research that shapes the game rules, more models can be created for elements that the literature finds to be important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of these interactions between models provide data for analysts to form qualitative judgments. For example, the air-to-air fight impacts anti-submarine warfare (ASW) by determining what level of risk maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) face in various geographic areas. If the air-to-air fight is going poorly for one side, their ASW efforts might suffer accordingly because of less MPA coverage. The quantitative results provide the basis for qualitative judgments about the effects of one domain on another. By providing a way for rigorous and transparent models to interact in an intelligent way, wargames provide a valuable aid to analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iteration-to-examine-a-variety-of-strategies&quot;&gt;Iteration to Examine a Variety of Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite often being overlooked in modeling, no discussion of combat outcomes can ignore the strategies of the respective commanders. For example, in 1939–40, the French outnumbered the Germans in troops and equipment, including tanks. However, the best Anglo-French formations moved north as Germany struck through the Ardennes to the south. The result was an encirclement of the French army and ultimately French defeat. Generalship matters. Months after the fall of France, Germany’s own plans fell short during the Battle of Britain. Although the Luftwaffe outnumbered the Royal Air Force, Luftwaffe leaders failed to appreciate the significance of British radar stations and aerial command and control. As a result, they were unable to translate their superiority in matériel into air superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor are recent examples lacking. In the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, Russia enjoyed many initial advantages, including larger and more modernized forces. Nevertheless, Russia’s initial plan for the invasion, to include the occupation of Kiev, greatly exceeded the capacity of its forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While developing a comprehensive set of possible results is impossible, focusing on the most likely and plausible interactions can produce an analytically sound and useful set of outcomes. With so many models interacting, there is no way to exhaustively explore all the possible decision points short of a massive computing effort. Even chess has a lower bound of 10120 possible games, despite only having 32 pieces and 64 legal positions. The ability to exhaustively analyze a series of models by exploring all possible decisions to see the distribution of possible outcomes likely lies in the distant future. Similarly, there are promising efforts to train computers to play games through millions of iterations, such as AlphaStar. While more plausible in the near term, these efforts still require large teams of expert programmers. Short of a focused government effort, this is not feasible for research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, iteration allows some of the most plausible lines of play to be explored. The project generated these plausible lines of play by having many different players participate in game iterations. To continue with the example of chess, there may be 10120 possible games, but most of those follow nonsensical decisions, such as allowing a queen to be taken by a pawn. Moreover, while there are many possible openings, almost all competitive openings follow the movement of the d- or e-pawn and efforts to control the center. The goal of iterative wargaming should not be seen as an effort to exhaustively explore all possible outcomes but rather as a way to assess the major lines of play that result from intelligent decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varying strategies over multiple iterations of a wargame generates data on the likely interactions between plausible strategies. One wargame may not be illustrative of the overall contours of the problem due to an a priori reasonable strategy being chosen that turns out to be suboptimal. For example, in one iteration of this project’s wargame, the Chinese invasion fleet was destroyed in one turn after the Chinese player chose a strategy of defending their coastline while simultaneously invading Taiwan. If that was the first and only wargame that was played, a highly erroneous conclusion would be reached. Repeated play of the scenario using different Chinese strategies showed that the Chinese invasion fleet being destroyed on the first turn is an outlier. Many other strategies that China could choose would lead to outcomes much more favorable to China. This case illustrated the importance of iteration to try multiple strategies, lest the insights from a single scenario are misguidedly based on a particular strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of having outside players participate is that they will try novel strategies that did not occur to the principal investigators. It is easy for the wargame creators to try a few strategies and then settle into a local optimum that they believe represents best play of the scenario. Outside players inject mutation into the play of the game with their own ideas about how to play. Like genetic mutation, most of these new ideas are maladaptive. However, some are successful and represent advances on best play. Some required additional research and the design of new scenarios to test (in a way suggested by J. Peter Scoblic and Philip E. Tetlock). This process of mutation, iteration, and refinement helps to explore the seams of the possible and plausible outcomes of the wargame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variation-of-key-assumptions-to-explore-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Variation of Key Assumptions to Explore Uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses of the future must explore how sensitive results are to variations in assumptions. For example, wars begin in different ways. While most wars are preceded by a state of crisis, if a defender is surprised and has not mobilized their forces, this will have a dramatic effect on the subsequent campaign. Political factors are often unclear before the clash of forces and could lead in multiple directions, such as whether the British would intervene when the Germans invaded Belgium in World War I. Weapon systems might perform far differently in combat than expected, such as the Mark 14 torpedo in World War II. An analysis that does not explore key uncertainties risks building a detailed argument on a foundation of sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iterating wargames in different scenarios with different assumptions for key variables allows for sensitivity analysis. A variable is a condition likely to have an impact on the analysis about which the analysis must make an informed assumption. In the same way that campaign analysis begins by specifying a scenario, this study refers to each bundle of assumptions for each variable as a scenario. For example, an invasion of Taiwan where China achieves operational surprise is one scenario; an invasion wherein operational surprise is not achieved is another. A new scenario is created when any assumption about a variable is changed: operational surprise with missile defense working is a different scenario than operational surprise without missile defense working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The selection of variables should reflect the purpose of the game. For example, in the services’ “Futures Wargame,” designed to test alternative force structures against one another, two iterations of the same scenario, one incorporating force structure from the so-called DOD program of record and one reflecting an alternative set of forces, were selected by experts and officers over a period of months. Thus, in the “Futures Wargame,” all elements of the game that are not related to order of battle should, to the extent possible, be kept equal. However, analytic wargames exploring other research questions require varying other assumptions between scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By running several iterations of the wargame with one scenario, then changing the scenario, it is possible to draw inferences about the importance and impacts of each variable change. The project team does not claim that this leads to a causally identified finding, which is the goal of experimental wargamers. However, it is possible to observe the impact of changing the assumptions about certain variables: for example, if Japan allows U.S. basing, then the outcome is likely to be more favorable for the United States than if basing is denied. More importantly, it allows for researchers to develop better judgments about the relative importance of these uncertainties: is Japanese basing more or less impactful on the outcome than Philippine basing? (Yes, as discussed in Chapter 8.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;By running several iterations of the wargame with one scenario, then changing the scenario, it is possible to draw inferences about the importance and impacts of each variable change.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to model all potential values of all variations. With 25 variables eventually identified by the project team that could take on binary values, that leads to 225 possible combinations, or approximately 33.5 million scenarios. Obviously, this is beyond the capability of human analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The selection of variables can be informed by previous literature or from insights generated during play. The question of which variables to include is the same problem that confronts efforts to make historical analogies. While no historical case is ever 100 percent analogous to another, it is possible to make inferences as long as they are similar enough in the most relevant variables.107 The variables of study must therefore both be uncertain and likely to have a high impact on the outcome. For example, in this project it became clear that the effectiveness of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) against moving ships was a critical factor in the outcome of the game after playing several iterations. A close review of the literature showed that this effectiveness was unclear. The project team therefore decided that the effectiveness of the JASSM was an important variable to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional variables came from players who participated in game iterations. They surfaced some of former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld’s “unknown unknowns,” factors that the game designers had not anticipated. Wargaming can help explore these “unknown unknowns” by facilitating brainstorming about key variables among players who then help to shape future scenarios by including important variables that the researchers did not think of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;human-participants-make-intelligent-decisions-generate-mutation-and-shape-assumptions&quot;&gt;Human Participants Make Intelligent Decisions, Generate Mutation, and Shape Assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary benefit of having human participants is to focus on the most plausible lines of play. As discussed above, the number of models, variables, and decisions in play make it impossible even for the most powerful computers to examine all possible lines of play for a game. Players of a game must choose the most promising courses of action. They can choose these lines based on knowledge of the actual countries’ doctrines, historically similar campaigns, and their own strategic intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach is to have a core group of players who have been involved in the game design. First, they are most familiar with the weapons systems and capabilities that go into the wargame, helping them to avoid blunders. The actual participants in a real-life conflict would be similarly familiar with their capabilities, so this allows for more plausible play. Second, the core group of players will know what broad courses of action have been used before and how they interact. This allows iterations to focus on lines of play that have been found to be more promising, rather than redoing earlier attempts at lines that have been found lacking. Finally, a core group of players can cycle through iterations much quicker than outside players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, outside participants are helpful in two ways. First, as discussed above, new players can inject mutation into strategies used by the core team. After several iterations, it is common for the core team to settle into a local optimum of strategies that they believe is best for both sides. New players can try new strategies that the core team finds unintuitive, shaking the game from its local optimum toward a global optimum. To integrate their intent with the game mechanics, the project provided each team with an “operations officer” from the staff. Second, outside participants can bring their knowledge into the game to refine the models underlying the rules. This is particularly the case when the number of outside participants in each game iteration is low (two to four). That allows each player to give in- depth feedback on any subject in which they have expertise. Several participants with experience in Pacific operations pointed out that current policy is to keep a continuous submarine presence in the Philippine Sea. The project, therefore, adjusted its order of battle to reflect this insight. This feedback means that there are slight changes that occur to the rules throughout the life of the project; however, this is compensated for by the increased fidelity of the project’s models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nesting-wargame-results-into-analysis&quot;&gt;Nesting Wargame Results into Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers of missiles fired and aircraft destroyed in any iteration are descriptive data, not analytic outcomes. The results of any of these runs are contingent on a multitude of factors beyond the underlying models, including the makeup of players and previous decisions in that game. For example, take two iterations whose scenarios were the same except for the assumption about Taiwanese ground force competence. The players in one iteration decided to use their missile inventory as quickly as possible, but the players in the other iteration decided to conserve their inventory. This difference had nothing to do with the changing assumption about the variable of Taiwanese ground force competence: the difference was produced solely by differences in the participants, or it could even have been the same participants wanting to try something different. It would be a mistake to conclude that the variable of Taiwanese ground force competence has a significant effect on the rate of missile expenditures. Thus, the quantitative data out of each iteration should not be seen as statistically significant projections about the future but as illustrative of the corpus of wargames that a project creates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytic wargames produce qualitative insights among the investigators, which must then be situated in an analytic framework. This framework should focus on not only the ebb and flow of events generally but also a description of how differing assumptions about variables impact the likely outcome of a conflict. Two factors make variables relatively more or less important: their impact on the outcome and the degree of confidence in their values. The analysis thus comments on the general impact of variables rather than the specific outcomes of games. To paraphrase President Dwight D. Eisenhower, “Wargames are worthless, but wargaming is indispensable” — the specific outcome of each iteration is not predictive of the future, but the process of wargaming is indispensable to analyzing the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, analytic wargames must be careful not to make assertions outside of their scopes or to confuse the insights of the wargame with the insights of their modelling. A wargame about the outcome of an invasion of Taiwan cannot claim to grant insights about the operational impacts that Chinese control over Taiwan would have on the defense of Japan; such speculation is outside of the scope of analysis. Separately, an insight such as that China likely has enough ballistic missiles to cover the tarmac of all the military airfields in Japan does not come from the wargame: it comes from the modeling and the assumptions that went into the modelling. While the analytic insights of wargames are valuable, they must be appropriately scoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-the-taiwan-operational-wargame&quot;&gt;Building the Taiwan Operational Wargame&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the methodological principles developed in Chapter 2 in mind, the project set out to develop a wargame to answer the questions: Would a Chinese invasion of Taiwan succeed in 2026? What variables most affect that outcome? What would be the cost to both sides?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first decision was whether to adapt an existing system for this project. As mentioned earlier, CNAS and the Körber Foundation have run similar wargames. Both games featured adversarial play between two teams of experts in conflicts with China. However, their focus on escalation dynamics and political decisionmaking made them unsuited for adaptation to this project’s methodology, which deals with political decisionmaking by varying scenarios across iterations. The different purposes of the projects meant that this study could not adapt their systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several commercial wargames are more operationally focused and have either a Taiwan invasion at the center of the game (Next War: Taiwan) or a Taiwan scenario as part of a larger conflict (Breaking the Chains). Although designed primarily for entertainment, these games are often the product of deep research and thoughtful mechanics. As a result, they have been used in professional military education (PME).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, several elements inherent to commercial games rendered them unsuitable for this project. First, commercial games, as a rule, balance playability and analytic rigor. This means that an important part of commercial wargame design is ensuring that both sides of the game have a path to victory, even if the balance of forces means that one side realistically does not have a way to win if both players are equally skilled (and lucky). The purpose of this project was to test outcomes of a notational invasion of Taiwan by China using the project team’s best estimate of forces available, national policies, equipment capabilities, and combat results. That may or may not produce a balanced result (in fact, it did not). For players, it can be deeply unsatisfactory to participate in a game if the prospects for victory are remote. However, that might be the correct analytic outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, commercial wargames do not reveal the assumptions and calculations for their force lay down and combat interactions. Although these are often sophisticated, the lack of transparency makes relying on them problematic. Is a particular outcome the result of analysis or a desire to balance play? Are calculations based on historical data, test data, or the developer’s judgment? At the same time, the project team’s review of the available commercial games suggested that important elements, especially air combat and attacks on air bases, were not represented rigorously. Next War: Taiwan focuses primarily on the ground campaign on the island, and Breaking the Chains focuses primarily on naval combat, generally between relatively small forces. Because of these issues, the project team needed a game where it understood and could stand behind every one of the game elements and assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar difficulties exist with adapting semi-official wargames, such as Assassin’s Mace, an operational-level wargame designed to simulate future war in the Western Pacific between 2025 and 2050. It uses the sophisticated Operational Wargame System developed by Tim Barrick and Mark Gelston. An invasion of Taiwan is one of the several scenarios available. The game integrates multiple warfare domains, including those outside of traditional military operations such as cyber and satellite intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). Assassin’s Mace is intended to provide PME to field-grade officers and, to this end, requires a significant amount of professional knowledge in participants. Given the audience and purpose, this game is granular in design. It is very well designed for its purpose, and it has entered wide use in U.S. War Colleges as a tool for teaching joint operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, like commercial board games, Assassin’s Mace was unsuited to this project’s purposes because of discrepancies between its rules and the project team’s modelling. For example, within the Assassin’s Mace game rules, the F-35 and J-20 both attack at 12 and defend at 7, meaning that both aircraft roll a 12-sided die to attack and must score a 7 or greater to destroy the other. This means that there is a 50 percent chance that an attack will destroy the other, or a 50 percent attrition rate. Given that the historical attrition rate per sortie in most conflicts is less than 1 percent, and only 2 percent for the particularly intense Battle of Britain, the project team would use a lower attrition rate. This is not to disparage the Operational Wargame System but to demonstrate how its rules produce different operational outcomes than the project team’s research would suggest. However, given the official nature of the Operational Wargame System, it might be reasonable to wonder if it (or any government wargame) is inherently superior to civilian wargames due to the possession of non-public information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-question-of-classified-data&quot;&gt;The Question of Classified Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project used only unclassified data so that its results can inform public debate. Some observers, particularly within the government, might argue that accurate modeling is impossible without access to classified data. However, classified data is not necessary for the construction of a credible wargame. Although classified data might help tweak certain parameters (e.g., missile ranges, intercept probabilities, and submarine detection capabilities), they would not change the fundamental structure of the game or the outcomes. The reasons are threefold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, much information that was previously classified is now available from open sources. For example, The Military Balance by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) provides detailed equipment numbers, while Jane’s databases provide detailed information about equipment capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Earth provides information about facilities that required U-2 flights during the Cold War. The team used Google Earth to determine the number and location of Chinese underground airfields, the size of parking ramps, and other parameters of air bases. Although classified imagery might refine this information, unclassified information is more detailed and accurate than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, classified data is not necessarily correct data. It is vulnerable to a lack of probing and testing because of restricted access. Indeed, bureaucratic and political forces may require government actors to accept weapons testing data that does not account for the friction that can greatly diminish weapons effectiveness in the real world. For example, classified Air Force testing projected a 92 percent hit rate for the AIM-9J missile before its fielding in Vietnam; analysis after the war found that its actual hit rate was 13 percent. A similar result was obtained in the infamous U.S. torpedo scandal of World War II. These mistakes were possible because projections of future conflicts require making assumptions about events that have never happened and classification prevented the usual vetting of these projections. No squadron of F-35s has ever engaged a squadron of J-20s; predicting the result of such an engagement relies on assumptions, regardless of classification level. Most of the parameters in the project’s wargame are based on historical data; classified information might help refine these assumptions but would not replace the importance of historical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the appropriate use of historical data can sometimes be more accurate in modeling future conflicts than classified information about specific weapons systems. Before Desert Storm, classified models using accurate weapons performance data predicted 20,000 to 30,000 casualties. However, private commentators predicted fewer casualties, based on data from Israel’s Six-Day War. Although the classified models had more accurate weapons capability data, they modeled the Iraqis as fighting as competently as the Soviets. The open-source models accounted for the poorer operational competence of Arab militaries, which more than made up for their deficiencies in classified weapons performance data. Thus, open-source models have value beyond their intrinsic transparency and public accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;philosophy-of-the-base-model&quot;&gt;Philosophy of the Base Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section lays out the key design choices that the project made and explains the reasons for the choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use rules rather than judgment.&lt;/strong&gt; As discussed in Chapter 2, models for analytic wargaming must be built in a rigorous manner on the best available open-source information. These models can be based either on the method of history or the method of Pks (see previous chapter). However, they must create a comprehensive set of rules that minimizes the influence of judgment. Of course, sometimes players will create situations that are plausible but unanticipated. In these cases, some judgment by the umpires is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate only demonstrated capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; The game is based on capabilities that the countries involved have demonstrated or have concrete plans to field. Players often had imaginative initiatives for cyber, special operations, and new systems, but the game did not include these unless the relevant country had demonstrated those capabilities. The relatively near time horizon of the game (2026) limits how many new capabilities might be fielded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are classified programs that might produce relevant capabilities. Some details about these programs have leaked out and have been incorporated into the game. Most elements would be fielded and operationally significant numbers after 2026, if fielded it all. However, this uncertainty is present in all discussions of national security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assume China has decided to invade.&lt;/strong&gt; Because the purpose of the game is to assess the outcome of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the game assumes that the CCP has made the decision to launch such an attack. The Chinese government could reach such a decision for a variety of reasons related to domestic politics, faulty intelligence, inaccurate military assessments, and international pressure that would not align with an outsider’s military or political assessment. External factors might also drive the decision. For example, Taiwan could move toward a declaration of independence, or the United States might begin permanently stationing troops on the island. The premise that China decides to invade is not a prediction but rather a tool that sets up the research question about whether such an invasion might succeed. However, the scenario is plausible given the concerns about such a Chinese course of action, as described in Chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use base and excursion scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt; The project developed a base scenario wherein all variables took their most likely values. Excursion scenarios explored key parameters about which there were plausible alternative assumptions. For example, the base case for Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) employability was that it could target ships at sea. An excursion scenario restricted JASSM-ER employability to stationary land targets. This approach allowed the project to explore the sensitivity of wargame results to changes in assumptions. (The next chapter discusses the base scenario and excursion cases in detail.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore diplomatic and political conditions with excursion scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt; Because the game play was primarily concerned with operational factors that affect military outcomes, the project accounted for political inputs as variables that were manipulated by control between iterations. It is possible to either model the political behavior of states through expert discussions during game play or to employ stochastic models (e.g., rolling a die to determine if a neutral country joins the conflict). However, such modeling is problematic. More important from the perspective of the project was the need to maintain a degree of control over game inputs so that a range of conditions could be examined. Rather than integrating these factors into the rules, this project explores them with excursion scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each of these political factors, the project identifies the most plausible outcomes, binned into a few meaningful categories. For example, consider the Japanese decision to enter the war. Discussions with experts led the project team to believe that the base case was that Japan would most likely enter the war only if Japanese bases or U.S. bases in Japan were attacked. This base case assumption was therefore used for most games. Certain excursion scenarios explored what would happen if Japan joined the United States from the first day of China’s invasion or if Japan never joined the war. Although there are in reality an infinite number of permutations on this critical factor, creating a few meaningfully different categories for assumptions and playing iterations with different assumptions allows the project to explore the effects of these highly uncertain yet important factors. Additionally, there are some plausible political decisions — such as the decision to surrender — that are possible but that cannot be usefully wargamed; those lie outside the scope of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt; The game focuses on combat around Taiwan and in the Western Pacific region that could affect such combat on the island. It abstracted operations in the South China Sea to maintain focus on Taiwan. These battles would unfold as the East Coast units of the U.S. Navy arrived in the region, having traveled via the Suez Canal. Chinese forces would attempt to block these U.S. forces from approaching Taiwan. Some Chinese forces are not available for the invasion of Taiwan, being stationed in the south to guard against such actions. As U.S. forces arrive, China must withdraw forces from other regions, including those attacking Taiwan, to maintain defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-taiwan-operational-wargame&quot;&gt;The Taiwan Operational Wargame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section explains specific design parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;time-scale&quot;&gt;TIME SCALE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn in the game is 3.5 days — the time increment needed to simulate enough real-world time to produce an estimate of the result of the battle and be playable in a single day. Multi-day games would take too long to run 24 iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that the invasion of Okinawa, a much smaller island than Taiwan, took two months and three weeks, the time scale had to allow exploration of several weeks of combat. This also gave insights into how depleting munition stockpiles affected the conflict: both sides had enough high-end missiles to launch continuously for several days, but what happens when those are gone? The 3.5-day turns allowed the project to get further into the battle than games with smaller time increments, which was critical for the study’s purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time scale required trade-offs to get through weeks of combat in a timely manner. First, it required some amount of aggregation: instead of modeling every aircraft, the game modeled aircraft squadrons. Second, it does not allow for as granular decisionmaking: players have to give general instructions for half of a week and cannot adjust their orders for day two based on the results of day one. Third, it required a specific sequencing in resolution for accuracy: for example, a surface ship traveling 30 knots could cover the entire game board in 3.5 days, but an enemy would almost certainly detect and react to such a charge within that time period. Sequencing combat resolution in a specific way allowed such interactions. However, weighed against the analytic benefits of the longer time scale, these disadvantages were judged to be acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-map&quot;&gt;OPERATIONAL MAP&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Taiwan Operational Wargame ― Operational Map.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air and naval combat in the Taiwan Operational Wargame (TOW) unfolds on an operational map of the Western Pacific. Hexes on the map are approximately 600 km (roughly 370 miles) from side to side. Each hex is colored according to its distance from Taiwan and numbered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each map hex lists the following information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of aircraft squadrons that can park on military and dual-use airport tarmac;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of aircraft squadrons that can be housed in underground hangars and hardened aircraft shelters (HASs); and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of SAM battalions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placed on the map are counters representing the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aircraft squadrons (representing 24 tactical aircraft and 12 large aircraft);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ground forces that have been moved between hexes;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surface ship task forces; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Squadrons of four submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ground-launched-missiles&quot;&gt;Ground-Launched Missiles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) is a formidable force. Thus, each game turn begins with ground-based missile attacks. These missiles primarily target U.S. and Japanese surface ships and air bases. To speed up play, China’s war-opening joint fires strike on Taiwan was modeled and pre-adjudicated in every iteration. This strike employs much of China’s short-range ballistic missile inventory and would largely destroy Taiwan’s navy and cripple its air force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s ground-launched anti-ship missiles are also a key element in the fight. Besides indigenous Hsiung Feng II and III missiles, Taiwan is procuring 100 Harpoon launchers and 400 Harpoons. These have the potential to inflict significant attrition on China’s amphibious force. Rather than having players specify an attack for these, the project models their likely use and effects on China’s fleet in each turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-amphibious-lift&quot;&gt;Chinese Amphibious Lift&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key output of the operational fight is the number of units that China can place on Taiwan in a 3.5-day turn. Rather than modeling specific waves of landings, the project models lift as the thousands of tons that China can transport across the strait over 3.5 days. Each battalion requires a certain number of tons, depending on whether it is leg infantry, mechanized infantry, armor, artillery, or engineer. Once China moves troops onto Taiwan, it must also keep them supplied, which progressively reduces the number of new formations that can be transported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four ways China moves troops onto Taiwan: amphibious landing, air assault, airborne, and via captured facilities. Amphibious landing over suitable beaches constitutes the primary way that China moves forces in an initial assault. The amount of amphibious lift decreases as major ships are sunk. Air assault with helicopters is limited to the extreme west of Taiwan due to range considerations, while airborne landings with paratroopers can occur anywhere on the island. Both methods are slowly attrited by anti-air artillery and man-portable SAMs, but attrition increases greatly if China’s air superiority is degraded. Ports and airfields enable the use of more varied ships and aircraft to accelerate the transport of troops ashore. The United States may attack these facilities to deny their use after Chinese capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;air-and-naval-combat&quot;&gt;Air and Naval Combat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players issue orders for their air and naval forces. These orders unfold over the course of the 3.5-day turn. These orders therefore must allow aircraft and ships to execute missions not only once but as frequently as they can over the course of the turn. For example, orders to fly combat air patrol (CAP) result in coverage as frequently as aircraft can sortie, ASW sweeps reflect the coverage of a hex that can be achieved through constant searching over 3.5 days, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;air-forces&quot;&gt;AIR FORCES&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aircraft are represented by counters. For fighter/attack aircraft, there are three categories: fourth generation (non-stealthy, no Active Electronically Scanned Array [AESA] radar), 4.5 generation (non-stealthy, AESA radar), and fifth generation (stealthy, AESA radar). Fighter/attack counters represent standardized squadrons of 24 aircraft. Most of Taiwan’s aircraft would be destroyed in the initial bombardment by China, but some would survive in their underground hangars on the eastern side of the island. Bombers are grouped into legacy and stealth bombers, and counters represent a standardized 12-aircraft squadron. Tankers and airlift are also tracked in squadrons of 12. Testing showed that categorizing aircraft by generation greatly facilitated game play at only slight cost in terms of fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighter/attack aircraft and bombers perform four missions in the game. First, they can try to establish air superiority with CAP, patrolling over the battlefield 24/7. Proximity to the battlefield is critical to establishing continuous CAP, as an hour spent flying to and from the battle area is an hour when an aircraft is not on station conducting the mission. Therefore, the distance between a squadron’s base and its target hex (usually Taiwan) and the amount of tanking available are key determinants in the time on station for fighter/attack squadrons performing CAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, aircraft can perform strike missions by attacking air bases, surface ships, ground units, and critical infrastructure. If there is adversary CAP over the target, then escorts are needed to defend the attackers. The choice of munitions for aircraft conducting these missions is critical. In the early stages of the war, sophisticated and long-distance cruise missiles are available, but as these inventories are depleted, aircraft must use shorter-range munitions and accept more risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, aircraft can perform ground support. This is divided between close air support near the front line of troops and interdiction at a distance from the front line to slow enemy movement. Both missions require flying over enemy ground troops and therefore involve risk from SAMs. They also require longer loiter times over the ground than strike missions, meaning that they can only be conducted when there is friendly air superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, aircraft can rebase to different hexes. All reinforcements arriving in theater must initially rebase. Units in theater can also rebase. Based on peacetime exercise reports, the game assumed that it takes approximately a game turn to set up operations and maintenance facilities at new bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;naval-surface-forces&quot;&gt;NAVAL SURFACE FORCES&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naval surface forces are represented in surface action groups (SAGs), carrier strike groups (CSGs), lightning carrier groups (LCGs), and amphibious groups. The size and composition of these forces vary by nation, as the United States, China, and Japan all have different fleet compositions (as mentioned above, the Taiwanese surface fleet would be largely destroyed in the initial phases of a conflict).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAGs can launch anti-ship missiles at enemy surface ships, launch cruise missiles at ground targets, or conduct ASW; however, their primary value is in intercepting enemy missiles and aircraft. (China’s large surface fleet has several potent SAMs, which pose a threat to U.S. and Japanese aircraft. U.S. and Japanese SAGs can similarly threaten Chinese aircraft while also potentially intercepting some of China’s tactical ballistic missiles, or TBMs.) However, after their missiles are depleted, ships must return to port and rearm, during which time they are vulnerable. All SAGs can also conduct ASW, which is a particular specialty of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Forces (JMSDF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;submarines&quot;&gt;SUBMARINES&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submarines are grouped into squadrons of four submarines. Diesel submarines, due to their shorter endurance compared with nuclear submarines, generally 30 to 45 days, must constantly rotate back to port for refueling and resupplying. Both Chinese and Japanese diesel submarine squadrons on the board therefore represent four submarines actively hunting and four submarines transiting back and forth from the hunting ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submarines can hunt other submarines. The United States and Japan begin with some submarines forming a barrier on the first island chain, intercepting Chinese submarines and inflicting attrition on them. They are aided by U.S. and Japanese MPA. Conversely, China can assign some submarines to intercept U.S. nuclear-powered submarines (SSNs) approaching the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submarines are potent threats to surface ships and can engage them with torpedoes and anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs). The speed of SSNs makes them much more effective at searching the open ocean. U.S. SSNs can hunt Chinese amphibious shipping in the Taiwan Strait (JMSDF submarines would not be able to concurrently hunt in the strait due to battlespace management issues). Their effectiveness there is diminished by Chinese corvettes and MPA actively conducting ASW, as well as a barrier at the entrance/exits to the strait comprised of Chinese submarines and minefields that China plants over the course of the opening weeks. Chinese submarines would not enter the strait itself in order to make it a free fire zone for these ASW forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber&quot;&gt;CYBER&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game included cyber at the operational level. Both sides have cyber exploits they can use against the other. These exploits are modeled as system penetrations that passively grant intelligence while they are undetected. However, teams can activate these exploits to conduct cyberattacks, thereby generating one-time effects. Once these active effects are used, the exploit is assumed to be identified and patched. The previously discussed restriction of the game to proven capabilities means that these effects, while potent, are not magic wands. For example, power can be shut down at some ports to degrade Chinese amphibious lift, but there is no ability to destroy all of China’s electrical grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game did not include strategic cyber affects that might affect the U.S. homeland or military command and control systems. These effects might have operational impact in the Western Pacific but lie beyond the scope of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ground-combat-map&quot;&gt;Ground Combat Map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground combat occurs on a different scale than the air and missile combat that dominates the operational map. While missiles fly at the speed of sound over thousands of kilometers, ground combat unfolds at the speed of a tired infantryman crawling forward under enemy fire. Thus, the ground map of Taiwan uses hexes measuring 30 kilometers (19 miles) across and uses the same 3.5-day turns. Within each hex, there is movement of the forward edge of the battle area. Ground forces include leg infantry, mechanized infantry, armor, artillery, engineers, and attack helicopters, each of which have different movement speeds and combat values. These combat values can be enhanced by combat air support provided by friendly aircraft. A key element of ground combat is the interdiction provided by Chinese aircraft, which slows Taiwanese movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While missiles fly at the speed of sound over thousands of kilometers, ground combat unfolds at the speed of a tired infantryman crawling forward under enemy fire.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players alternated between the operational map and the ground map, moving forces and initiating combat on each map during a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sensitivity-analysis&quot;&gt;Sensitivity Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each iteration (run of the game) was set in a specific scenario with plausible assumptions about each variable. A scenario refers to the specific combination of assumptions used for one iteration. The scenario where all variables are set to their most plausible values is called the base scenario. As discussed earlier, varying the assumptions from iteration to iteration allowed the investigators to develop judgments about the effects of those variables on the likely outcome. The next chapter explains these most likely base case assumptions and the excursion cases that the project tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assumptions--base-cases-and-excursion-cases&quot;&gt;Assumptions — Base Cases and Excursion Cases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every wargame requires assumptions about dozens of variables, from the grand strategic and political context, through the strategic military situation, down to minute details about operations and weapons. This chapter describes the assumptions underpinning the wargame’s base scenario and the alternative assumptions (called “excursion cases”) that the project explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “base case” in the project’s terminology is the most likely value of a given variable. “Most likely” does not mean certain but simply more likely than other possibilities. The base scenario is a game iteration wherein all the variables are set to their base case (so that no variables take on a less likely value). The project ran three iterations of this base scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An “excursion case” is a less likely but plausible value of a given variable. Given the limitations of time and resources, the project selected excursion cases based on two criteria: (1) those variables that might have the greatest impact on the outcome of a scenario, and (2) those base case elements that were most uncertain. The project ran a total of 24 game iterations: three base scenarios and 21 scenarios with alternative assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By playing iterations of the game with excursion cases, the project team was able to assess the sensitivity of the findings to alternative assumptions. An “excursion scenario” is a game iteration that used one or more excursion cases. Some excursion scenarios varied a single assumption. Most varied several assumptions; as noted above, varying assumptions one by one would have required playing over 33.5 million games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table below summarizes the major assumptions, their base case, and the excursion cases explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grand-strategic-assumptions-political-context-and-decision&quot;&gt;Grand Strategic Assumptions: Political Context and Decision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the base case assumptions about the grand strategic context of the conflict, particularly the conditions under which each state decides to join the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-principal-combatants-china-taiwan-the-united-states-and-japan&quot;&gt;THE PRINCIPAL COMBATANTS: CHINA, TAIWAN, THE UNITED STATES, AND JAPAN&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China:&lt;/strong&gt; As discussed earlier, the project assumes that China has decided to launch an invasion. They have the advantage of deciding when the war starts and use that flexibility to attack preemptively taking advantage of tactical surprise. They will have created uncertainty about the timing of the attack by gradually expanding military exercises in the preceding years, making it difficult for other countries to know that this time is the real attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; The project assumes that Taiwan resists vigorously. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Taiwan’s military spending as a percentage of GDP is 4.4 percent, China’s is 1.7 percent, and U.S. spending is 2.3 percent. Taiwan’s relatively high level of peacetime spending represents serious social commitment. Further, Taiwanese officials have repeatedly stated their intention to defend the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, morale is hard to predict. While many countries have fought fiercely despite long odds (e.g., Finland in the Winter War and contemporary Ukraine), others have surrendered soon after invasions (e.g., Thailand and Denmark in World War II). When faced with a Chinese assault, Taiwan might capitulate rather than fight. There have been worrying reports about CCP penetration of the Taiwanese military. The base case assumes that Taiwan resists to the maximum extent of its capabilities. However, the project recognizes that this is an assumption. As immediate Taiwanese capitulation would mean that there is no war, it is impossible to analytically wargame. Taiwanese morale is therefore outside the scope conditions of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Entry into the War:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes immediate U.S. intervention. For reasons discussed at the outset of this report, such intervention seems more likely than not despite the lack of a formal treaty. The United States has deep historical ties to Taiwan, and U.S. policy opposes unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. The United States defended Kuwait’s autonomy in 1991 and defended Ukraine in 2022, albeit with weapons only in Ukraine’s case. The United States has never foresworn the possibility of using force to defend Taiwan, and the Taiwan Relations Act stipulates that the United States will “consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means . . . a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.” This language has been regularly echoed by administrations from both parties, including the present one, for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Taiwan stands alone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although the base case assumes immediate U.S. intervention, there may be circumstances under which the United States does not engage. Each time President Biden states that the United States would respond to Chinese attack, other administration stipulate that U.S. policy has not changed. Moreover, Biden may not be president in 2026. Actual decisions would depend heavily on the personality of the president and on the domestic and international circumstances of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Important international circumstances would include whether actions by Taiwan were seen as contributing to crisis (e.g., passing a referendum on formal independence); the reaction of other important actors (not least Japan); and the existence (or absence) of concurrent crises or events. Domestic circumstances in the United States (e.g., war weariness or economic downturn) might also act against U.S. involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The “Taiwan stands alone” excursion case assumes no direct U.S. intervention. The United States commits no U.S. combat units of any kind to the conflict. Furthermore, without the direct involvement of the United States, Tokyo and other regional governments would view their own intervention as excessively risky and would therefore remain neutral. The United States and possibly other partners might allow weapons and ammunition resupply. However, unlike the situation in Ukraine, the Chinese defensive zone makes this essentially impossible (described below in Chapter 6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The United States delays authorization for combat operations one or two days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This excursion case assumes the possibility of a minor delay of one or two days before the commencement of U.S. combat operations. Even when attacked, nations sometimes hesitate to respond militarily as they seek to understand what has happened. Sometimes this produces devastating results (for example, Clark Airfield in the Philippines at the beginning of World War II). Given that the initial Chinese landing force unloads over several days, such a delay would affect the conflict by precluding U.S. bomber strikes (originating from Alaska and Hawaii) on the first turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The United States delays combat operations for 14 days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There might be a more substantial, two-week delay. In this excursion case, the U.S. national command authority attempts to preserve Taiwanese autonomy without paying the price of direct conflict by engaging Beijing through diplomacy to halt the invasion. This effort lasts for a week while the invasion unfolds. When diplomacy fails, the United States declares a no-fly zone over Taiwan, which China vigorously opposes. The United States gets drawn into direct conflict when this “low-cost” approach fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Troops on Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case has no substantial U.S. presence on Taiwan when the conflict begins. The United States has not stationed significant forces on Taiwan since the 1970s. A recent increase in 2021 raised the U.S. troop level on the island from 20 to 39; however, this force could do little beyond liaise. Although stationing more U.S. troops would be military advantageous, it would provide a clear cassus belli for China. If the United States deployed troops to Taiwan in response to every Chinese exercise that could be serving as cover for an invasion, then the United States would quickly shut down many roads to peaceful resolution. Even if the United States knew when the invasion was coming and deployed troops to Taiwan only then, China could still seize on that deployment to justify their already planned invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: U.S. forces deploy to Taiwan before conflict begins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although unlikely, it is theoretically possible that the United States would station forces on Taiwan before conflict begins. This could happen in two ways. First, concerns about Taiwanese security might drive the United States to position some forces there in peacetime despite vehement Chinese opposition. Second, Chinese mobilization might generate enough U.S. concern that it is willing to risk provocation by putting U.S. forces on Taiwan. In this excursion case, a Marine Littoral Regiment (MLR) deploys from Okinawa to Taiwan with its load of missiles and one reload, augmenting the shore-based fires of Taiwanese ASCMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan can influence the conflict in two major ways: (1) by allowing the United States to operate its forces from bases in Japan, and (2) with the direct intervention of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF). Japan hosts more U.S. bases and servicemembers than any other state in the world. The United States operates these bases despite their being on sovereign Japanese territory. The proximity of these bases to Taiwan and the lack of nearby alternatives means that a major part of the U.S. response to a Chinese invasion operates out of Japanese bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Japan and China are not on friendly diplomatic terms and the United States and Japan are allied, Japanese intervention against China is not assured. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States binds the two countries in a limited defensive alliance. Article V states that, “Each Party recognizes that an armed attack against either Party in the territories under the administration of Japan would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional provisions and processes.” As Japan analyst Jeffrey Hornung observes, none of the critical decisions about Japanese assistance to U.S. operations are “legally automatic. . . . All these decisions are political, resting with the prime minister at any given moment.” Despite these caveats, recent activities point to mutually coordinated action in the event of a war with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are recent suggestions that Japan would participate to some degree in the defense of Taiwan. Japan has built a formidable military. Japanese military spending is significantly greater than that of any other Asian state other than China or South Korea. The JSDF began deploying overseas for disaster relief and humanitarian relief early in the Heisei era. Japan’s new Defense White Paper warns that China’s growing military muscle, overflights, and naval incursions “have become a matter of grave concern to the region including Japan and the international community.” A commission from Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party proposed increasing Japan’s “counterattack capability.” The 2015 update to the “Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation” outlined an expanded set of roles for Japan in the event of “an armed attack against a country other than Japan” that “threatens Japan’s survival.” However, it would be a mistake to read these movements as definitive proof of whole-hearted and immediate Japanese participation in the defense of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the U.S.-Japanese treaty and these recent (admittedly non-definitive) political developments in Japan, the base case assumes that Tokyo: (1) allows the United States access to U.S. bases in Japan freely from the outset; (2) directs the JSDF to engage Chinese forces only in response to a Chinese attack on Japanese territory (to include U.S. military bases in Japan); and (3) allows the JSDF, after entering the war, to conduct offensive operations away from Japanese territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also Japan’s path of least resistance because it avoids a difficult internal decision and a potential confrontation with the United States. Furthermore, refusing the United States use of the bases would risk undoing the long-standing U.S.-Japanese alliance, which has underpinned Japanese security policy for 70 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Japan participates from the beginning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One excursion case assumes that Japanese forces participated actively from the beginning of the conflict. The events leading up to war could involve explicit threats to Japan or some other form of sharply exacerbated tensions between Beijing and Tokyo. Japanese officials have stipulated that preemptive attacks on adversary systems are constitutionally permissible if it appears that preparations are under way for attacks against Japan. A brewing Taiwan war might provide the circumstances that would justify preemptive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While obtaining the approval to enter the war could be cumbersome, the specific nature of the evidence of a triggering attack is not stipulated by law. It is plausible that a government might, under emergency conditions and with the advantage of a majority in the Diet, obtain such a declaration and begin to operate against Chinese forces. Having obtained a Diet declaration, the JSDF or civilian defense officials would likely be empowered to determine what adversary assets constituted a threat to Japan. This might result in Japan joining the war at the outset alongside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Japan is completely neutral.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Japan might seek to prevent all U.S. military activities from its soil. Although mutual defense treaties give the United States the right to use its bases, the Japanese might balk. There is often a disconnect between peacetime expectations of military access and what is given in a crisis. In a study of historical patterns in the granting or withholding of access during U.S. military operations, Stacie Pettyjohn and Jennifer Kavanagh write, “peacetime and contingency access decisions are driven by fundamentally different dynamics.” And despite strong public support for the U.S.-Japan alliance, public discussions of concrete issues, such as a Taiwan conflict, often lack clear or realistic appraisals of potential consequences — topics that would become acute when facing large-scale violence by China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The JSDF is limited to defensive operations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, the JSDF might be limited to defensive operations over Japanese territory even after entering the war. In this scenario, legal or political constraints prevent the JSDF from conducting operations away from Japanese territory. The only extraterritorial operation this excursion case allows Japan to conduct is ASW on its eastern approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-allies-partners-and-adversaries&quot;&gt;Other Allies, Partners, and Adversaries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S.-China conflict would not happen in a vacuum. The stakes involved would be so great and the economic disruption so widespread that every country on the planet would react. This section lays out the base case and excursion cases for other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional Allies and Partners:&lt;/strong&gt; A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would put all countries in the region in a dilemma. On the one hand, they are more likely to fear the close power of Beijing than the distant power of Washington. All have reasons to be wary of the strengthening of China’s position that might result from a conquest of Taiwan; furthermore, all have reasons to be friendly to the United States, which would be clamoring for access, basing, and overflight rights. On the other hand are the dangers that would result from participation, either active (e.g., directing forces against China) or passive (e.g., granting the United States basing rights). The safest course of action for most countries would be to remain neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asian scholars are relatively unified in assessing that most countries would remain neutral. In congressional testimony, Bonny Lin, an Asia scholar at CSIS, argued that “India, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam . . . may try to stay neutral or provide limited, less conspicuous forms of assistance.” John Culver was more forthright:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think you’d get a chilling set of answers if you approached authoritative people in our treaty allies — Australia, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, South Korea and our partners like Singapore and important other countries in the region like Vietnam — and ask them in the event that China attacks Taiwan, will you back our military alliance? Will you assist in preventing Chinese conquest? With maybe one or two exceptions, I think the answer we would get is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more optimistic assessment by Zack Cooper and Sheena Chestnut Greitens posits some basing access granted by the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand, although this would only happen under “certain circumstances” and “would likely come with severe limitations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these analyses, the project decided on the following as the base case for particular countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam:&lt;/strong&gt; All would be concerned about Chinese encroachment but also fear Chinese power. They would be sympathetic to the United States and Taiwan but reluctant to expose themselves to Chinese attack. Thus, they would take a passive approach, allowing U.S. overflight and transit but not participating themselves or allowing operations from their territory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea:&lt;/strong&gt; South Korea would not only fear Chinese power but would also worry about hostile actions by North Korea, whether driven by the North Korean leadership or incentivized by China to distract the United States and Japan. Indeed, South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol has said that in the event of a conflict over Taiwan, North Korea would likely stage a provocation that would draw South Korea’s focus. The project assumed that because of the pressing nature of the conflict with China the United States would release two of its four squadrons in South Korea. However, because of the continuing threat from North Korea, the other two squadrons would remain in South Korea for deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia:&lt;/strong&gt; Because of its close relationship with the United States and the stationing of U.S. forces there in peacetime, Australia would give access, basing, and overflight. Australian forces would participate in the South China Sea fight but be unavailable as a result for operations around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Philippines:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes that the Philippines remains neutral. This assumption was driven first by the relative weakness of the Philippine military compared with the Chinese military. For example, whereas China has a large and modern navy, the Philippines has a small coastal navy with only four ships over 1,000 tons. Its air force focuses on counterinsurgency, with only a small number of modern jet aircraft. This imbalance in relative strength was illustrated by the Philippines reaction when a Chinese vessel rammed and sank a Filipino fishing vessel in the vicinity of Recto Bank in the West Philippine Sea. President Rodrigo Duterte refused to take a strong stand against the Chinese incursion, later stating in public “I am powerless there.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumption of Philippine neutrality was also based on Duterte’s general diplomatic shift away from being a close partner of the United States and attempting to balance between U.S. and Chinese interests in the region. This move was driven by both personal animus toward the United States and the promise of Chinese investment into the Philippines. As part of this shift, there was a move away from security cooperation with the United States, with the notice of cancellation of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which allows the United States to temporarily station forces on Philippine bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The Philippines allows U.S. basing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An excursion case allows the United States to base aircraft out of Philippine military airports. What seemed like a sharp rupture with the United States during the Duterte era is now less clear. Between the failure of Chinese investment to materialize and Chinese actions in the South China Sea, the Philippines have had a partial reproachment with the United States. The Philippines withdrawal from the VFA was postponed, then replaced by a recommitment to the VFA and other defense pacts. Further, there is no clear assessment of what Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s position is, despite the overall favorability of the United States in the Philippines. Since being elected, Marcos Jr. has made statements strongly affirming Philippine rights in disputed areas of the South China Sea while simultaneously insisting that Philippine-China relations are “set to shift into higher gear,” indicating a continued desire for closer ties with China. With these mixed signals, it is possible that the Philippines would allow U.S. basing and overflight during a war against China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Europe:&lt;/strong&gt; Europe has been wary about becoming involved in the U.S.-China competition. China’s immense economic power and the Europeans’ lack of territory in the Pacific drives Europe to maintain good relations with China. None of these countries are so closely involved in Pacific affairs that they regard China as a direct threat that would warrant automatic participation in what could be World War III with potential nuclear consequences. However, Europe is also wary of Chinese authoritarianism and desires to maintain the liberal international order. The United States has engaged NATO and the European Union in its efforts to contain China and has had some success. Despite these engagements, it is likely that most European countries would limit themselves to economic sanctions on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom and France might be exceptions since they have sent military forces to the Pacific in the past and possess expeditionary forces. However, those forces are not permanently stationed in the Pacific and would take a long time to arrive. The governments would likely take longer than the United States to decide about intervention, and the forces would not have used the warning time to increase readiness for deployment. When they do get there, the arrival of one or two small aircraft carriers and nuclear attack submarines would be useful but not decisive. The ability of other European countries to provide military aid to the United States in the Pacific is extremely limited even if these countries wanted to help. Therefore, the project assumed that Europe would not be a factor in the initial stages of the conflict that the wargame simulates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunistic Aggressors:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia, North Korea, Iran, or others might take advantage of U.S. distraction to launch aggressive action in their own spheres and attempt to settle long-standing territorial claims. Opportunistic aggression would still be risky for the aggressor if its local opponents are powerful. For example, if North Korea stages a provocation, that might bring other combatants into the conflict against China, such as South Korea, NATO, or the Gulf states, if it looked like the military operations were connected. To have an effect during the short timelines of the game, opportunist aggression would require close coordination between China and the other state before the conflict breaks out so that the opportunistic aggression takes place simultaneously or nearly simultaneously with the Chinese attack. These preparations would likely be detected ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, there is historical experience. During the 2000s, when the United States was deeply involved in conflicts in the Middle East, other nations did not take advantage of U.S. distraction, nor was there opportunistic aggression during the period of the Korean or Vietnam Wars. Thus, the base case assumes that other adversaries would not launch their own military operations and that the United States could focus on the conflict in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: There are simultaneous crises.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, China itself might launch the invasion in response to U.S. distraction by a crisis elsewhere or might itself instigate others, particularly North Korea, to take advantage of the situation despite the risks. Therefore, an excursion case considers what might happen if the United States faced simultaneous crises. This excursion case reduces the U.S. order of battle and delays the reinforcement schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-assumptions-orders-of-battle-mobilization-and-rules-of-engagement&quot;&gt;Strategic Assumptions: Orders of Battle, Mobilization, and Rules of Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next set of assumptions covers the strategic context, namely the force structure, mobilization, and doctrine of combatants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;order-of-battle&quot;&gt;ORDER OF BATTLE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orders of battle (OOBs) are “the identification, strength, command structure, and disposition of the personnel, units, and equipment of any military force.” OOBs are critical for designing wargames because they specify what units participate, their location, and their strength. However, OOBs are often not published in detail for security reasons, and the project therefore had to deduce them from publicly available documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China:&lt;/strong&gt; The Chinese OOB is derived from best estimates in open-source intelligence, principally from IISS, Jane’s weapons descriptions, and the annual report by DOD to Congress about the Chinese military. The lack of documents corresponding to the U.S. Future Years Defense Program and reports on Programs of Record means that some educated guesswork about Chinese aircraft and ship production is required. However, there is less uncertainty in projecting a 2026 scenario than one in the 2030s or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese missile inventory is particularly important. In the base case, all Chinese conventional ballistic missiles are available within the timescale of the game (generally three to four weeks) and have warheads that are appropriately matched to whatever land-attack mission they are tasked to perform. For example, warheads used against aircraft parked on U.S. and Japanese air bases are optimized for such attacks by using 3-pound bomblet submunitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Chinese missile inventories, their warhead types, and their availability are highly uncertain because of the lack of Chinese published material. Because missiles account for so many of the U.S. air and naval losses across all scenarios, the project explored two Chinese missile-related excursion cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: China has increased TBM inventory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This excursion case explores the effect of additional TBMs (beyond the base case) in China’s inventory by 2026. China has stopped adding short-range ballistic missiles to its ballistic missile inventory (and may be reducing such inventories) in favor of other forms of firepower for short-range missions (particularly strike aircraft and long-range Multiple Launch Rocket Systems) and longer-range missile systems, particularly the DF-26. China could shift additional force structure toward longer-range TBMs, particularly those with boost-glide hypersonic missiles. In this excursion case, the Chinese inventory of intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) and boost-glide missiles is 50 percent larger than that stipulated in the base case, both for land-attack and anti-ship missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: China has reduced TBM inventory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conversely, China’s TBM inventory might be reduced if more TBMs are withheld for nuclear missions or as a hedge against other conflicts. Despite the PLA’s new emphasis on joint operations and jointness, PLARF assets have only partially been integrated into the Theater Command (TC) structures, which are designed to facilitate joint operations. Unlike the other services, there is, for example, no PLARF deputy commander within the TC staffs. The PLA or its political overseers might opt to withhold some DF-26 launchers, with their interchangeable nuclear and conventional warheads, for an enhanced nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, China’s TBMs may not have an optimal warhead to target match. The base case assumes that China has analyzed and built the ratio of unitary to submunition warheads that maximizes their impact in each iteration played. However, it is possible that China’s targeting plans are either wrong or that they are forced to change them in the war. This would force China to use less-efficient unitary warheads against aircraft in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Given possible missile holdouts and a less than ideal mix of warhead types, an excursion case reduces the number of Chinese medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) and IRBMs by 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; As mentioned above, the sheer volume of Chinese missiles makes Taiwan’s air and naval forces almost irrelevant; besides a few squadrons that are isolated in Taiwan’s underground shelter until they are dug out, these forces are destroyed in the first few days of an invasion. However, the same is not true of Taiwan’s ground forces, which become critical to the outcome of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OOB for active units of the Taiwanese military comes from Ian Easton and the IISS 2022 Military Balance. For the ground forces, two tweaks were required. First, Easton provides very specific brigade and battalion numbers for the whole force, and the ostensible force structure has remained relatively stable since his book was published. However, the botched transition to an all-volunteer force has caused personnel numbers to drop significantly and units to be undermanned. To an extent, this could be offset by having reservists backfill into active units, but Easton’s numbers are still inflated. The base scenario therefore reduced the number of maneuver battalions in each brigade by one. These resulting notional battalions are still small by U.S. standards but comparable to their Chinese counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the division between heavy and light mechanized infantry in the table is somewhat arbitrary. On the one hand, Taiwan’s M-60 tanks (and M-1 tanks, if they arrive by 2026) are much heavier than the light armored vehicles associated with Chinese marine and airborne units. On the other hand, Taiwan’s mechanized infantry is mounted in old M-113s with 20-mm guns, and Taiwan still has many M-41 and M-48 tanks, which date from the 1950s and early 1960s. Furthermore, China’s ZTL-05 amphibious assault gun is a derivative of the British 105-mm L7 gun that is likely able to penetrate Taiwan’s M-60s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major sources for the Taiwanese reserves were Easton et al., IISS’s 2021 Military Balance, and GlobalSecurity.org. Information on Taiwan’s reserve brigades is thin, but a few things are known. They are large but not well prepared. There is, however, some variation in quality and readiness. There are several levels. A-level brigades are the best prepared and reportedly include one battalion of active cadre per brigade as well as an artillery battalion. Other levels are less well defined. Some sources suggest a second level includes military personnel affiliated with military educational institutions and that the brigades include artillery. Beyond 21 or 24 “first-line” reserve brigades, there are coastal defense units and a very large but even less well-equipped force of local reserves or militia. The project models the “first-line” reserve battalion as having half the lethality of an active-duty battalion. For artillery, IISS lists 2,093 artillery pieces in the inventory. Most are probably old, and many may not be serviceable but could be used to field 60 artillery battalions in the active and reserve forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Taiwan has not received ground-launched Harpoons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because the PLA must come to Taiwan and land on one of a few suitable beaches, the invasion is vulnerable to short-range ASCMs. Indeed, the original article prescribing a “porcupine strategy” for Taiwan described mobile coastal-defense cruise missiles as “at the top of this list” of systems for Taiwan to acquire. There is currently a deal for the United States to sell 100 ground-based Harpoon launchers and 400 missiles to Taiwan. If that sale goes through, those missiles would have a large impact on a Chinese invasion. However, there have been reports of a possible delay. Furthermore, the United States sent some Harpoons to Ukraine, which may delay the Harpoon delivery to Taiwan. Therefore, an excursion case assumes that these Harpoons are not on Taiwan at the start of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States:&lt;/strong&gt; Many budget documents and official statements fed into the U.S. OOB, with some extrapolations to 2026 required. These included the Department of Defense’s FY 2023 budget overview, the service budget highlight books, the Navy’s 30-year shipbuilding plan, and, for the Army and Air Force, force structure projections contained in their operations and maintenance budget justification books. Location of individual units, where needed, came from the websites of individual military bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reinforcement schedule assumes global sourcing: U.S. forces from around the world would be sent to the Pacific. Some U.S. forces head to Taiwan from the north and east. These appear on the game’s operational map. Other forces would head there via the Indian Ocean. As noted in Chapter 3, these latter forces engage the Chinese in abstracted battles around the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been seen during the conflict in Ukraine, modern militaries expend munitions at a high rate. The game, therefore, tracks the most important munitions, especially those with limited inventories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. munitions inventories were estimated from budget documents and allowed for production lead times, generally two years. Some munitions, such as the Army’s Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and the Navy’s JASSM, are not expected to be available in large numbers in 2026 and were therefore not included. Other munitions not specifically tracked, such as air-to-air, were assumed to be available in sufficient numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This inventory is distributed globally. Although large elements are in the Pacific already and in the United States, available for shipment overseas, other elements are in Europe and the Middle East. The base case assumes that all these munitions would be available for the conflict against China. The OOB has a decrement to strategic airlift to redistribute these munitions and other supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach accepts risk in other theaters, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. However, this would likely be the U.S. approach, given the immediacy of the conflict against China. Other regions would still have access to alternative munitions such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) or the Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) I and II, which are available in large numbers. Using these short-range munitions would increase risk to U.S. forces if conflict occurred, but given the lower capability of regional air defenses, this risk would likely be judged acceptable. Further, allies and partners could provide some standoff capabilities in these other theaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Submarines are withheld for other missions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although they would likely be effective hunters of a Chinese amphibious force, U.S. SSNs have several other missions with which they are tasked. Most notably, they trail adversary ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) to hold at risk the nuclear capability of hostile countries. The base case assumed that all available SSNs are reassigned to either defeating the invasion of Taiwan or clearing the South China Sea since a conflict with China is an immediate and grave demand. However, some SSNs might be withheld for these other missions and therefore not be available for operations near Taiwan. Therefore, an excursion case assumes that two fewer submarine squadrons (eight SSNs total) are available to the U.S. player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; As in the U.S. case, Japanese defense holdings and deployments are relatively transparent, allowing the game OOB to be built from a variety of documents. The baseline for 2022 was established using IISS’s Military Balance and cross-checked with information in Japan’s annual Defense of Japan white paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Medium-Term Defense Program outlines broad future plans every five years. For production and acquisition rates and other specifics, the OOB used data from annual military budgets, published in English in abbreviated detail and in full detail in Japanese. Japanese defense spending has been trending upward since 2013, increasing 26 percent through 2021, with the declared intention of increasing spending further in the future. Within Japan’s proposed 2023 budget, the acquisition of additional standoff strike capability is listed as the number one priority for strengthening defense capability, and this project assumes that it will have acquired a small inventory of Joint Strike Missiles (JSMs), among others, by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;warning-and-mobilization&quot;&gt;WARNING AND MOBILIZATION&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although in all scenarios conflict was assumed to occur after a period of crisis, China’s attack was still able to achieve tactical surprise. (See next section for discussion of mobilization.) The reason is the precedent of Ukraine, where adversary forces freely relocated without triggering conflict, though the other side made precautionary moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the base case, China takes measures to minimize warning time by, for example, using a large exercise to mask its preparation and delaying measures that would provide unambiguous warning, such as requisitioning large numbers of civilian lift ships, until late in the process. The project team postulates that these unambiguous signals would begin at D minus 30. Although the United States and Taiwan would see these preparations, there would likely be considerable uncertainty about Chinese motivation and intentions. Thus, the base case assumes that Taiwan and the United States would have unambiguous warning at D minus 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this warning, the United States alerts its forces and moves some forward in an effort to deter China. The United States frequently moves forces forward to signal its resolve during periods of crisis in accordance with doctrine about “Phase 0.” If deterrence fails, then under this concept forward-based forces would strengthen the US military response. In the base case, these deployments consist of a CSG sent to the Ryukyus (in addition to the CSG in Japan) and two bomber squadrons sent to Guam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: There is no U.S. “show of force.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although forward deployed forces might strengthen deterrence, they become highly vulnerable when inside the Chinese defensive bubble. Thus, if the United States were reasonably certain that China could not be deterred, it would be prudent to keep forces far from the Chinese mainland before D-Day. In this excursion case, the CSG stays outside of the second island chain, while the bomber squadrons stay in the contiguous United States until D-day. The effect is that China cannot destroy them in a surprise attack with TBMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, even after unambiguous strategic warning from the intelligence community, there would be some hesitation. Residual uncertainty about Chinese intentions, fears of escalating the crisis, and concerns about alarming the public would mitigate against aggressive action. Thus, the base case assumes that the United States surges some but not all its forces. However, the alert allows forces to move more quickly once the conflict begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Culver, a former national intelligence officer for East Asia and now an Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argues that Chinese preparations to invade Taiwan would be seen months or even years ahead of time. It is certainly true that China would need to prepare, and many of these actions would be visible. However, it is not clear how quickly these preparations would be interpreted as signaling an invasion and how quickly military action would be taken in response. Leaders in target or allied states may also fear that defensive preparations would prompt or provoke attacks that might not otherwise occur or, alternatively, might cause self-inflicted harm from damage to economic markets or panic buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The United States mobilizes late.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a Taiwan crisis, U.S. leaders might misinterpret Chinese preparations, wish to avoid exacerbating tensions, or be ambivalent about accepting the risks of direct conflict with a nuclear-armed power. The “late U.S. reaction” excursion case eliminates the two-week reaction period prior to hostilities and delays the arrival of U.S. forces by two weeks relative to the base case. Thus, no U.S. air elements reinforce peacetime presence in Japan or Guam, and U.S. naval forces arrive later than in the base case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumes that Taiwan responds quickly to invasion. This means that there is no hesitation or delay caused by political indecision or Chinese actions such as propaganda, sabotage, or special forces attacks. Furthermore, Taiwanese command and control has dispersed or taken cover, so they are not vulnerable to a decapitating Chinese first strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Taiwan has a delayed reaction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An excursion case examines what might happen if the Taiwanese response were delayed because of Chinese action or Taiwanese political hesitation. In this excursion case, military forces in the threatened zone an operate, but other forces are frozen for one turn (one half week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;rules-of-engagement&quot;&gt;RULES OF ENGAGEMENT&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules of engagement are “directives issued by competent military authority that delineate the circumstances and limitations under which United States forces will initiate and/or continue combat engagement with other forces encountered.” They are important for wargames because they govern the actions that players can take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Strikes against the United States:&lt;/strong&gt; Because the United States will be striking the Chinese homeland, the base case assumes that the U.S. homeland is not a sanctuary. However, the ability of the Chinese to conduct strikes against the U.S. homeland and thereby affect operations in the Western Pacific is extremely limited. A few special forces might infiltrate and attack a small number of high-value targets but not enough to materially affect military operations in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, the Chinese might send a submarine to the U.S. West Coast to attack cities and maritime facilities. In the play of the game, the Chinese submarine fleet was fully occupied fending off U.S. and Japanese warships in the Western Pacific. Even if the Chinese decided to divert a few submarines to such attacks, their effect on military operations would be small. Their psychological effect on the U.S. population might be large, but this would take time to affect military operations. Some game participants hypothesized that the Chinese would mine U.S. ports, thereby preventing the exit of Navy ships. Such an attack might, in theory, be done stealthily. However, prewar surveillance during a time of heightened crisis would identify any Chinese military forces operating near the West Coast, and the Chinese have not demonstrated an ability to do such operations from merchant ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese might launch economic, information, and diplomatic initiatives to isolate the United States and undermine popular support for the conflict. However, the effects of such efforts would not be manifest in the short time duration of this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Strikes against Mainland China:&lt;/strong&gt; There is ongoing debate about whether the United States would strike targets on mainland China during a conflict. On the one hand, striking a nuclear power’s territory threatens nuclear escalation. State adversaries have been extremely careful about attacking the homeland of a nuclear power. In providing HIMARS to Ukraine, for example, the United States reportedly attached the condition that no attacks on undisputed Russian territory be conducted with them. Similarly, the United States has refused to supply Ukraine with ATACMS because it could strike deep into Russian territory. In the case of the Korean War, which occurred before China had acquired nuclear weapons but after the Soviet Union had, the United States refrained from striking bases in both China and the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, military advantage would come from attacks on the Chinese mainland. U.S. airpower could attack Chinese aircraft on the ground when they are most vulnerable and sink Chinese amphibious ships in port. The United States has built a large inventory of JASSM-ERs for this purpose. Additionally, there will be a desire for revenge against China: China will have killed thousands of Americans and, if it strikes Guam, attacked U.S. territory. In World War II, the United States struck the Japanese homeland through the Doolittle raid as soon as it was able, not for military advantage but to achieve propaganda value for striking back at an aggressor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts have speculated about the United States striking the first blow and attacking the Chinese fleet in port when unambiguous warning has been received. This would inhibit or even prevent the Chinese from establishing a beachhead in the first place. However, it would initiate a war with the United States as the aggressor, provoking all the adverse political consequences related to such an action. Further, arguments for striking on unambiguous warning would run into the memories of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction in 2003, when unambiguous strategic warning turned out to be erroneous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumes limited, non-preemptive attacks on the Chinese mainland. The United States can attack Chinese air bases and ports that are directly involved in Chinese strikes on Taiwanese and U.S. forces. It rules out a broader air campaign aimed at destroying Chinese infrastructure, industry, leadership, and command and control as being too provocative. This appears to be a middle course between a preemptive strike or broad attack on Chinese society and a prohibition against any homeland strikes at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: U.S. National Command Authority rules out strikes on mainland China.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regardless of what U.S. military planners may assume during peacetime about the most efficient application of U.S. military force in a Taiwan scenario, major rules of engagement and especially questions related to mainland strikes will ultimately be decided by the president, who will weigh a wide variety of military, political, and diplomatic considerations. The president may judge that the risk of escalation is too high given the potential benefits. The president might also believe that the United States could prevail without strikes against the mainland. Thus, this excursion case assumes a presidential prohibition against any mainland strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operational-and-tactical-assumptions-competence-weapons-and-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Operational and Tactical Assumptions: Competence, Weapons, and Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumes that U.S., Chinese, and Taiwanese forces have equivalent levels of operational competence. Unless there was strong evidence to the contrary, the project assumed that they would maintain operational competence. For capabilities where some doubt existed, excursion scenarios investigated what would happen if forces were not able to match their announced capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of conflicts between the United States and potential opponents (including China), this assumption tends to bias against the United States since its training standards are higher than most. Taking all sides’ capabilities at face value may give a modest boost to China since it has more unproven capabilities than the United States — from the ability to execute an anti-ship ballistic missile strike to simply moving troops from ship to shore in an amphibious landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to assess capabilities at face value also recognizes the great uncertainty in such judgments, given the dynamic condition of China’s military capabilities. Chris Dougherty, a wargaming expert at CNAS, made this argument in cautioning against downgrading estimates about the PLA because of overestimates about the Russian military. He noted that “Chinese military reforms over the last 20 years, combined with President Xi Jinping’s counter-corruption policies, had created a more professional and accountable force” and “built advanced weaponry at a scale far exceeding that of Russia.” Equivalency also incorporates continued Chinese advances in operational competence over the next four years, particularly as they conduct exercises of increasing size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-competence&quot;&gt;OPERATIONAL COMPETENCE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted by the recent Russo-Ukrainian war, different militaries conduct operations with varying degrees of competence. These variations are often unclear a priori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA Amphibious Competence:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes a high level of Chinese amphibious competence. This requires that the Chinese military increases the scale, intensity, and realism of landing exercises between now and 2026, that they are astute in evaluating and codifying lessons learned and in formulating and diffusing doctrine, and that they can execute doctrine in combat. In calculating the ability of a Chinese amphibious fleet to get troops and materials ashore, the base case employs offload rates similar to those associated with late-World War II U.S. operations, including Operation Neptune (for the D-Day landings) and Operation Iceberg (the invasion of Okinawa). These rates reflect hard won wartime experience that the Chinese do not have. On the other hand, modern technologies like helicopters and widely available amphibious infantry fighting vehicles facilitate more rapid offload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: China has reduced amphibious offload rates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While high competence is possible and useful to assume as the base case, it is entirely plausible that China’s actual performance may be less skillful. Even if China continues to expand its amphibious training and exercises, it will lack the practical combat experience of the United States in World War II. The U.S. Marine Corps focused on amphibious attack prior to the war, conducting annual landing exercises of increasing scale between 1932 and 1941 and systematically developing procedures. Many of the operations conducted earlier in the war, such as Operation Watchtower (Guadalcanal) and the Torch landings in North Africa, were less smooth but provided valuable experience. Only after addressing those issues were the high offload rates (from D-Day and Okinawa) achieved. Although China may benefit from and build upon the documented lessons learned by the historical experiences of others, only large-scale experimentation and the codification of lessons learned from exercises can create practical capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the Falklands War of 1982, for example, the lack of recent experience with amphibious operations and the impact of Argentine air and missile attack produced lower British offload rates than those achieved by Allied forces almost four decades earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This excursion case reduces Chinese amphibious lift by 30 percent to match the offload rate of the British in the Falklands instead of the Americans in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwanese Army Training:&lt;/strong&gt; The project assumed the Taiwanese units were as effective as similarly sized and equipped Chinese units. The project team recognizes that there is a vigorous debate about the quality of the Taiwanese armed forces. Some argue that its training is stylized and unimaginative, the readiness of units is poor, and conscripts acquire few useful military skills. On the other hand, the Taiwanese would be defending their homeland and might show the tenacity and ingenuity that the Ukrainians have shown in their struggle against Russia. Nevertheless, even with high morale, the lack of training and top-tier equipment means that Taiwanese reserve forces operate at half strength in the base case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Taiwanese ground units are understrength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s ground forces may not be as ready and competent, unit-for-unit and type-for-type, as China’s. Taiwan’s military, and especially its army, was identified with the authoritarian politics of KMT rule, and the transition to democracy during the late 1980s and early 1990s brought suspicion of the institution. The attempted transition to an all-volunteer force, which originally aimed to phase out all conscription by 2013, has failed to produce the intended results. Recruiting shortfalls have required the continued use of conscription but with terms of service reduced from one year to four months. Moreover, even with continued conscription, the army has been unable to fill its ranks, with just 81 percent of its positions filled in 2020 (and personnel levels of between 60 and 80 percent in many combat arms units). Potentially disruptive reductions in force structure have also been undertaken, and the combination of those reductions and the failure to fully staff units has reduced the army’s size from 200,000 in 2011 to 94,000 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reserve personnel may fill vacancies in active-duty units during wartime, and Taiwan is exploring a variety of ways to increase numbers and improve the realism of its training. Nevertheless, 2026 is just a few years away, so Taiwan is running out of time to overcome these shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This excursion case sets the combat power of Taiwan’s active-duty army units at 75 percent that of similar Chinese units (i.e., the combat power of a Taiwanese light mechanized battalion is set at 75 percent that of a Chinese light mechanized unit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s reserve forces, already set at 50 percent of the combat power of corresponding active-duty units, are reduced to 75 percent of that strength, giving them combat power equal to 38 percent (0.5 x 0.75 = 0.38) of a corresponding Chinese active-duty unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLAAF Parity:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes that each “generation” of aircraft has equal capability, regardless of nationality. While the U.S. Air Force has hitherto undoubtedly been superior to the PLAAF, Air Force leaders and defense scholars warn that this superiority is eroding. The Air Force’s greater experience with large air campaigns and stealth aircraft is counterbalanced by Chinese superiority in air-to-air missiles and their geographic advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S. air planners have run large air campaigns in recent decades, their Chinese counterparts lack such experience. The last wartime employment of large formations of Chinese aircraft was during the Korean War, and the last time that a Chinese combat aircraft shot down a manned aircraft of any type was in 1967, when a U.S. Navy F-4 was downed in southern China. During China’s incursion into Vietnam in 1979, Central Military Commission directives prevented PLAAF combat missions beyond the border, and air units operating within Chinese airspace achieved sortie rates averaging only one flight every five days. Doctrinally, Chinese air practice has historically placed heavy emphasis on centralized control in both planning and execution and a heavy degree of ground control over flying units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been working to address this shortfall in aerial planning and execution. In recent years, as new airframes have been brought into service, the PLAAF and People’s Liberation Army Naval Air Force (PLANAF) have sought to adopt more flexible Western methods, such as giving authority to flight leaders, conducting unscripted and competitive exercises, and holding “golden helmet” competitions in air-to-air combat. However, given the magnitude of the cultural adjustments required, doctrinal change is very much a work in progress. Moreover, flight training continues to have stovepiped career progression with little movement of pilots between training and combat billets. Perhaps most importantly, there is no Chinese equivalent of the U.S. Air Force Air Weapons School (“Red Flag”) or U.S. Navy’s Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program (“Top Gun”), schools designed to train selected pilots who then return to line units to become training planners and instructors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing the United States’ superiority in doctrine and training are the advantages brought by China’s long-range air-to-air missiles and geographic advantage. The Chinese PL-15 air-to-air missile outranges most Air Force Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) variants, meaning that the Chinese will often get the first shot in combat beyond visual range. Furthermore, the proximity of Taiwan to Chinese bases on the mainland will give China several advantages. First, Chinese pilots will be fresher during air combat than U.S. pilots, who will often have had to fly long distances from bases in Japan. Second, although Chinese SAMs could not effectively target U.S. fighter/attack aircraft over Taiwan, these SAMs give Chinese pilots a sanctuary from U.S. pursuit while ensuring that U.S. pilots must keep one eye on the ground during air combat. U.S. pilots will also need to watch for Chinese surface ships that push east of Taiwan. Third, Chinese AEW platforms will be more survivable because they can quickly retreat under the SAM umbrella of the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The U.S. Air Force is more competent than the PLAAF.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is possible that the United States’ superiority in training and planning outweighs the technology and basing advantages that China has. As Baron von Richthofen, the World War I ace, observed, “the quality of the box matters little. Success depends upon the man who sits in it.” Therefore, an excursion case explores the impact of U.S. air-to-air lethality that is 30 percent greater than that of the Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the general strengths and weaknesses of the PLAAF and Air Force is the specific question about the relative quality of both sides’ fifth-generation fighters. As a result of the U.S. aviation industry’s more established and competitive position, the United States has operated stealth aircraft for longer and has more mature fifth-generation designs. U.S. combat experience with stealth dates back to 1989 when two stealthy F-117As delivered ordinance against an airfield in Panama. Desert Storm in 1991 saw widespread stealth use. After thorough vetting, the F-22 achieved initial operational capability as the world’s first fifth-generation aircraft in December 2005. It remains the only aircraft to have supercruise capability (i.e., the ability to maintain flight at supersonic speeds without the use of afterburners). The Air Force declared the F-35A combat capable in 2016 after prolonged development problems. It was designed without supercruise but has an extremely low radar cross-section and unparalleled sensor fusion, providing pilots with excellent situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far less is known about the Chinese J-20 than U.S. stealth aircraft. However, although the J-20 first flew in 2011, China’s defense industry has not yet been able to produce the WS-15 engines that were intended to provide the J-20 with supercruise. It is equipped with canards and, with the latest WS-10C engines, thrust vectoring, which will give it high maneuverability, perhaps similar to the F-22. However, most analysts believe that it will also have a higher radar cross-section (i.e., less stealth) than either the F-22 or F-35. Little is known of the J-20’s electronics. While the sensors will certainly have range and electronic warfare capability, the system is unlikely to incorporate the same degree of sensor fusion as the F-35.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: U.S. fifth-generation aircraft are superior to Chinese counterparts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An excursion case explores the possibility that U.S. fifth-generation aircraft are more capable than Chinese fifth-generation aircraft. Although the J-20 will likely evolve into a fully capable fifth-generation fighter, it may not reach that stage within the 2026 timeframe of the game and thus may not be equal to the F-22 or F-35 in direct combat. This excursion case reduces the lethality of the J-20 to 4.5-generation standards while maintaining benefits that accrue to stealthy aircraft (e.g., reduced vulnerability to naval or ground-based SAMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;weapons-effectiveness&quot;&gt;WEAPONS EFFECTIVENESS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, the project generally accepted weapons effectiveness at face value. However, two particularly consequential cases vary this assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JASSM-ER vs. Ships:&lt;/strong&gt; The JASSM, a conventional, stealthy, air-launched ground-attack cruise missile, is a special case. Its long-range precision guidance and stealthy characteristics make it an important munition for the United States. The basic version is designed for ground attack. A critical judgment is whether the extended-range version, the JASSM-ER can strike naval targets. Although there is an anti-ship variant, the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), relatively few of the latter will be available in 2026 (roughly 450 LRASMs vs. 3,650 JASSM-ERs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publicly available information about the capabilities of the JASSM-ER is unclear. There are hints that it could have some anti-ship capability. In its FY 2022 budget request, the Navy introduced the AGM-158B JASSM-ER to “enhance long range strike and existing OASuW [offensive anti-surface warfare] capability.” The document suggests that it will be possible to “convert JASSM-ER software to a C++ software baseline, similar to LRASM, and focus on combining JASSM-ER strike capability and LRASM OASuW capability into a merged Navy JASSM baseline. Future efforts will expand both Navy strike and OASuW capabilities within Navy JASSM.” The Air Force also continues to upgrade variants of the JASSM-ER. Depending on the adjustments required to make the missile capable of anti-ship operations, it is possible that the capability could be retrofitted onto existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the JASSM-ER’s infrared target recognition seeker has even modest capability against moving ships at sea, the impact would be enormous. By mixing JASSM-ERs with salvos of LRASMs, Chinese ships would have to expend interceptors engaging incoming salvos of JASSM-ERs, allowing more LRASMs to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumes that the JASSM-ER has some limited capability to strike ships at sea. High numbers of these munitions allows a much greater volume of fire against the Chinese fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: No Maritime Strike JASSM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a high degree of uncertainty about whether the JASSM-ER will have anti-ship capability by 2026. Because the United States will have many JASSM-ERs, and the ability of the Chinese amphibious ships to survive is central to the success of an invasion, this assumption would make a large difference in the game outcome. Hence, this excursion case assumes that the JASSM-ER does not have anti-ship capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship Defenses:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes that the missile defenses of both sides work as described in publicly available documents. This produces a single-shot probability of intercept of 0.70 and, with a shot doctrine of two interceptors per incoming missile, a combined intercept probability of 0.91.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few publicly available Pk figures for interceptors against missiles, but the 0.70 figure is roughly consistent with modeling work in the public domain. A 2017 thesis for the Naval War College, for example, cites a Pk of between 0.60 and 0.80 for the Standard Missile-2. The author of that study stipulates that the values given are not “actual figures” but “are within reasonable magnitude of the actual to produce valid and applicable results.” In the context of national missile defense, longtime analyst Dean Wilkening writes that “BMD designers apparently expect interceptor SSPKs around 0.80 to 0.85,” though he suggests that such probabilities “may be difficult to achieve in the presence of countermeasures.” The Missile Defense Advisory Alliance reports that 79 of 97 hit-to-kill intercept attempts have been successful across all programs since 2001, a rate of 0.81. Similar figures recur throughout the literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Chinese and U.S. ship defenses do not work as well as expected.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The history of modern warfare is replete with examples of systems, particularly missile systems, that underperform in combat. Missile tests are frequently conducted under ideal conditions that begin with checks to ensure that all systems are in working order. There are many points where the fog and friction of combat could dramatically degrade a weapon’s effectiveness. Even after combat, the effectiveness of systems is unclear. There was a lengthy (and still unresolved) debate about the effectiveness of missile defense against Scud missiles in Desert Storm. This difference between peacetime testing and wartime employment could mean that ship-based cruise missile defense is much less effective than assumed in the project’s base case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By how much could ship-based cruise missile defense be degraded? A 2020 study of all cruise missile attacks on warships since 1967 concluded that 60 of the 162 missiles launched (or 37 percent) struck the target. Of the 63 percent that did not, some fell victim to missile failures or soft kill, which are handled separately within this project’s model. Against ships that were on high alert and defended against the attack, 124 missiles scored 34 hits (or 27 percent). This contrasts with the base case, wherein multiple independently adjudicated intercept attempts result in an average of only 5.6 percent of subsonic and 7.4 percent of supersonic cruise missiles hitting their target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excursion case increases the effectiveness of anti-ship missiles by postulating that 25 percent of missiles fired hit their target. Although this higher Pk is applied against both sides’ ships, this change affects the Chinese more because they have far more ships exposed to missile attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber and ASAT:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the lack of historical evidence on the effectiveness of cyber and ASAT tools in operational warfare, the project credited each with being moderately effective. As discussed in Chapter 3, each side possesses cyber exploits that give passive benefits and could be used for one-time active effects. These effects are significant but not magical. For example, the United States can shut down power to some Chinese ports and reduce their lift by 20 percent that turn but cannot shut down all power in eastern China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ASAT warfare, the project assumes (1) that both sides possess moderately effective dazzling and electronic warfare capabilities, (2) that they use these immediately and consistently to degrade each other’s ISR, (3) that co-orbital interference will take longer than the length of a game iteration (i.e., a month), (4) that both China and the United States possess some direct-ascent capabilities, and (5) that the United States is politically constrained from being the first to use direct-ascent weapons, but also (6) that if China uses its direct-ascent ASAT weapons, the United States can respond in kind, and (7) that ASAT use would greatly degrade adversary ISR capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;infrastructure&quot;&gt;INFRASTRUCTURE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardened Aircraft Shelters:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes that neither the United States nor Japan builds additional HASs prior to war. During the 1980s, the United States and its allies constructed roughly 1,000 HASs in Europe, South Korea, and northern Japan. Against Chinese ballistic missiles, HASs would reduce aircraft losses by forcing China to target individual shelters with unitary warheads and deny it the ability to destroy multiple aircraft with a single missile equipped with submunitions (cluster munitions). Analysts have, therefore, long encouraged the construction of additional shelters in areas under Chinese missile threat today, though little has happened since the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Japan has more HASs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are signs that both the United States and Japan are recommitting to hardening as part of an effort to improve operational resilience. This excursion case assumes that the United States and Japan build 400 additional shelters, for an estimated cost of $2.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to Civilian Airfields:&lt;/strong&gt; Attacks against aircraft parked in the open is effectively a density problem, with the probability of kill for each aircraft in target areas being determined by total missile coverage (the numerator) divided by the total potential parking area (the denominator). The base case assumes minimal dispersion to civilian airfields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Japan grants increased access to civilian airports.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dispersing Air Force aircraft to civilian airports could greatly expand the parking area that China must attack and thereby reduce US and Japanese losses. There is likely a decrease in operational efficiency that comes from stretching maintenance and support personnel across multiple sites. However, with the alternative being operating from damaged military fields, this efficiency loss is probably acceptable. Each Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) base seems to be paired with a regional civilian airfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An excursion case therefore expands access to civilian airports. If the United States and Japan can space aircraft on the ground farther apart than the submunitions of a Chinese missile can cover, then China would have to expend one missile per aircraft. This would quickly deplete China’s inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter describes the results of the iterations. They are grouped in five categories of scenarios: base, pessimistic, optimistic, “Taiwan stands alone,” and “Ragnarok” (highly pessimistic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall finding is that China is unlikely to succeed in an invasion of Taiwan in 2026 if four conditions hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan must vigorously resist. If it does not, the rest is futile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States must join hostilities within days and with the full range of its capabilities. Delays and half measures make the defense harder, increase U.S. casualties, and raise the risk of the Chinese creating an irreducible lodgment on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States must have use of its bases in Japan. Without them, the United States cannot use its numerous fighter/attack aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States must possess enough air-launched, long-range ASCMs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even a successful defense of Taiwan comes at great cost. The United States and its allies lose dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and thousands of personnel. The high losses would damage the United States’ global position for many years. While Taiwan’s military is unbroken, it is severely degraded and left to defend a badly damaged economy on an island without electricity and basic services. China’s navy is in shambles, the core of its amphibious forces is broken, and thousands of soldiers are taken as prisoners or war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-outcome-taiwanese-autonomy&quot;&gt;Key Outcome: Taiwanese Autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key condition for judging outcomes was the continued autonomy of Taiwan as a political entity. This condition excludes consideration of damage to the Taiwanese economy or the extent of U.S. losses. While these factors remain relevant and the concluding chapter of this report considers them in the context of the military outcome, the stated U.S. and Taiwanese policy goal is autonomy, without a discussion of cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most iterations lasted around six turns, representing three weeks of combat, though some iterations went longer. If results were uncertain when game play ended for outside players, the project staff would sometimes play a few more turns to clarify the outcome. The project staff made a judgment at the end about how to score the outcome. It is important to note that the full campaign, taken to its conclusion, would generally take months. The game investigates the first three or four weeks, which are the most intense for air and maritime operations. The most intense ground operations would happen later, as ground forces sought a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese amphibious, airborne, and air assault capabilities gradually deteriorate under U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese attack, so China cannot rely on them indefinitely. If China can secure ports and airfields and keep them operational, they will ultimately win. If they cannot, Chinese forces will eventually crumble. In optimistic scenarios, Chinese amphibious capabilities would be destroyed in a week. In pessimistic scenarios, the Chinese amphibious fleet might survive to the end of a month. The status of Chinese-held ports and airfields on Taiwan was therefore the critical factor in determining the outcome of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of each iteration was scored as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Victory:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese ground forces outnumber Taiwanese forces on the island. Once that happens, and the Chinese control enough airports and ports to bring the bulk of their ground forces over, they will eventually prevail, though the complete conquest of an island the size of Taiwan would take many months, barring a capitulation. Two iterations continued until total conquest; most iterations were ended when Chinese victory appeared inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stalemate:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese forces have a significant lodgment ashore, and neither side can make rapid gains. Chinese forces have captured a handful of ports and airports. The United States is striking those facilities to make or keep them fully unusable, while China is attempting to repair them and make them fully functional. This outcome typically occurred when China was able to secure the southern part of the island and the facilities there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Stalemate, trending toward China:&lt;/strong&gt; China has a solid beachhead that is not in danger of being eliminated. They have more than three ports or airports on Taiwan, although these may be damaged. To defeat the invasion, the United States and its allies would have to keep these ports and airports suppressed, resupply Taiwan, and, possibly, commit ground forces to rescue the Taiwanese position. China would have to clear ports or airports with the engineers landed, possibly while under attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;Stalemate, indeterminate:&lt;/strong&gt; An ambiguous situation, often involving the loss of the entire Chinese amphibious fleet, but with Chinese forces securely ashore and having occupied several damaged port or airport facilities. Resolution depends on whether China can restore the captured facilities to supply and expand its forces before Taiwanese forces counterattack in strength. The campaign would take an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. &lt;strong&gt;Stalemate, trending against China:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the Chinese have a significant beachhead, they do not possess a favorable enough force ratio to make quick gains against opposing Taiwanese ground forces. The Chinese amphibious fleet has suffered high attrition, and they have no working ports and airports on Taiwan. China is trying to substitute small civilian craft for the large amphibious carriers that it has lost, but as the British found at Gallipoli, this results in a dramatically lower supply throughput. An important question on the Taiwan side would include the state of its ammunition stocks and the ability to resupply. Whatever the eventual outcome, it is not where the Chinese would want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Defeat:&lt;/strong&gt; The Chinese amphibious fleet is mostly destroyed, and the Chinese have not taken sufficient ports or airports such that major landing operations can continue. Relatively small Chinese forces are confined to a small landing area, and they are only receiving small amounts of supplies from airdrops and small civilian boats. At this point, it would be a matter of time for the Taiwanese forces to mop up Chinese survivors. The main challenge for the United States would not be in eliminating the remaining invaders but finding an acceptable off-ramp for hostilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams played five types of scenarios: base scenarios, pessimistic scenarios, optimistic scenarios, the “Taiwan stands alone” scenario, and “Ragnarok” scenarios. The latter four examined the impact of adjusting critical assumptions from their most likely base case to less likely excursion cases (discussed above in Chapter 4). This section summarizes the design of the scenarios run, the operational outcomes, the losses incurred, and which variables appeared to be critical. The discussion provides specific numbers and detailed descriptions. However, these are not intended to imply that these are precise predictions but rather to share the raw data on which the authors formed their judgments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;base-scenario&quot;&gt;BASE SCENARIO&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; The project team conducted three iterations of the base scenario (using only base case assumptions without any of the excursion cases described in Chapter 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; Two out of three of these iterations were decided quickly, with the Chinese forces ashore unable to capture major cities and out of supplies within 10 days. In one iteration, PLA forces landed in the south and captured the port at Tainan. However, U.S. air strikes prevented its use, and the Chinese position was untenable by D plus 21. This was the only iteration of the base scenario that was not judged to be a decisive Chinese defeat, instead scoring as “Stalemate, trending against China.” In all cases, at least 90 percent of the Chinese amphibious fleet was destroyed, leaving the forces ashore supported only by air drops and heliborne supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5c286Cg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Operational Results: Base Case Scenario, Range, and Average.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese teams attempted different strategies that affected outcomes in all scenarios, including the base scenario. However, even with a sound Chinese strategy, the combination of challenges facing PLA invasion forces was too great to overcome. Despite the base cases assumption about a large but plausible number of civilian ships incorporated into the Chinese amphibious fleet, the buildup of PLA forces ashore is slow. Throughout the duration of the buildup and until ports and airports are captured and repaired, amphibious ships will be anchored off the invasion beaches, with ships shuttling between Taiwan and the Chinese ports as they empty. This is particularly true after the initial supply of amphibious assault vehicles is expended. In every iteration of the base scenario, U.S., allied, and partner forces were able to destroy shipping before the forces ashore were large enough to conduct sustained offensive action against defending forces flowing toward the beachhead. Anti-ship missiles delivered by Taiwanese shore batteries, U.S. aircraft, and U.S. and Japanese submarines all took a heavy and rapid toll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound Chinese strategy could mitigate, but not stop, this attrition of the amphibious fleet. China has a substantial fleet of modern warships, and most Chinese teams placed SAGs, comprised of cruisers, destroyers, and frigates, to the east of Taiwan to serve as air and missile defense pickets. They also dispatched submarines further into the Western Pacific to keep U.S. surface forces at bay. These slowed attrition to the amphibious fleet while making the surface combatants themselves more vulnerable to attack. At the same time, Chinese missile forces were capable of suppressing Taiwanese air power and severely limiting (and attriting) the buildup of U.S. land-based tactical air capabilities in Japan. During the initial stage of the conflict, China’s air forces enjoyed substantial air superiority over Taiwan and were able to employ ground-attack aircraft and bombers to obstruct the movement of Taiwanese reinforcements to the battle area. These strengths, however, were unable to offset the challenges of getting Chinese ground forces ashore in Taiwan and keeping them supplied once there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the base case iterations, China was able to land a total of 37 battalions. With losses deducted, China’s strength at the end of the iteration averaged 30 battalions, or 30,000 personnel (including non-combat elements). On average, the size of the Chinese beachhead ashore measured roughly 2,600 km2 (or 7 percent) of the total Taiwanese territory of roughly 36,000 km2 by the end of game play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3: PLA Situation Ashore at End of Iteration, Base Case Average.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Balanced against Chinese failure to achieve operational objectives in the base scenario were the large losses suffered by all the combatants. Considering the short period of time, U.S. air losses were greater than any witnessed since the Vietnam War. Naval losses were greater than anything experienced since World War II. Japan also suffered heavily: two out of the three base iterations saw strikes against airfields across the length of the archipelago. Taiwanese losses in personnel and infrastructural damage were great. China’s losses were also staggering and included large numbers of aircraft, virtually its entire fleet, and thousands of personnel. Although losses were high for both sides, the speed with which the base scenario ends (often decided by the sinking of China’s amphibious fleet after 10 days) limits losses in the ground campaign for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RP8lkmA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 4: U.S., Japanese, and Chinese Air and Naval Losses, Base Scenario.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative strength of U.S. and Chinese air-to-air capability was unimportant because most aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The lack of U.S. and allied air bases within practical range of Taiwan led to crowding at the few bases available. Furthermore, most of those bases lack any HASs to mitigate damage. Thus, Chinese missiles destroyed many aircraft — about 90 percent of total U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese losses — on the ground, despite the large number of U.S. and Japanese air and missile defenses on Okinawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States lost between 168 and 372 aircraft in the three base scenario iterations. Subtracting the 96 Navy fighter/attack aircraft lost on U.S. aircraft carriers in all base scenario iterations, the Air Force suffered losses between 70 and 274 aircraft, mostly on the ground. In one of the base scenario iterations, the Chinese team did not attack bases in Japan, but China did strike Andersen Air Force Base in Guam in every iteration, producing losses there. Japanese air losses were also high in two out of three iterations, averaging 122 aircraft, and were also largely incurred on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all iterations of the base scenario, U.S. Navy losses included two U.S. aircraft carriers as well as between 7 and 20 other major surface warships (e.g., destroyers and cruisers). These losses were partly an artifact of U.S. forward deployment aimed at deterring China, as the scenario begins with two carriers and an additional SAG positioned in vulnerable positions off Okinawa. It also reflects the vulnerability of surface ships to large salvos of modern anti-ship missiles. These salvos exhausted the ships’ magazines of interceptors; even with the base case assumption that shipborne missile defense works very well, there are simply too many attacking missiles to intercept. The JMSDF suffered even more heavily, as all its assets fall within the range of Chinese anti-ship missile systems, which include anti-ship ballistic missiles and long-range ASCMs as well as submarines and shorter-range munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In all iterations of the base scenario, U.S. Navy losses included two U.S. aircraft carriers as well as between 7 and 20 other major surface warships (e.g., destroyers and cruisers).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s air losses included roughly half of its operational air force, the majority lost on the ground to missile strikes. Even within the scope of the these relatively short iterations, the 26 ships of Taiwan’s navy (22 frigates and 4 destroyers) were destroyed by a combination of China’s joint fire strikes and aggressive hunting by China’s second-tier naval ships. The land battles were fierce but limited in scale, with Taiwanese army casualties averaging about 3,500, with about a third of those killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s losses in the base scenario were also high. In all iterations, PLAN ships around Taiwan were the primary focus of attack, and China’s naval losses averaged 138 major ships in the three iterations of the base scenario. On average, these included 86 amphibious ships (90 percent of the total) and 52 other major surface warships. Chinese aircraft losses, averaging 161 fixed-wing combat aircraft per iteration, were smaller than those for the United States. But in the base iterations, the United States never attacked Chinese bases (though they were permitted to do so according to the scenario assumptions), so all of China’s air losses were suffered in the air. Therefore, China would have lost many aircrews but had no losses to ground crews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s overall personnel losses were high. In ground combat, China suffered an average of 7 battalion-equivalents destroyed, equal to Taiwan’s ground losses. This would translate to about 7,000 casualties, roughly a third of whom are assumed killed. Another roughly 15,000 soldiers were lost at sea, with half assumed killed. Finally, many (and probably an overwhelming majority) of the 30,000-plus Chinese survivors on Taiwan would likely become prisoners at the end of combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Variables:&lt;/strong&gt; The LRASM was particularly useful because of its ability to strike Chinese naval forces and directly reduce Chinese invasion capabilities. In every iteration, the United States expended its entire global inventory of LRASMs (about 450 missiles) within the first week of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because LRASM inventories were so limited, the base case assumption about the effectiveness of the JASSM-ER against ships played a critical role in the speed and effectiveness of that attrition campaign. In the base scenario, the inventory of several hundred LRASMs, with a range of 600 km, combined with thousands of JASSM-ERs, with even greater range and modest anti-ship capability, allowing U.S. bombers and tactical aircraft to rapidly attrite the Chinese fleet from beyond the range of its anti-aircraft defenses. Thus, the large inventory of JASSM-ERs provided the numbers necessary to conduct the anti-ship campaign quickly and at standoff distances (the implications of this are discussed in Chapter 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the large JASSM-ER inventory and the uncertainty of its ability to strike ships, varying that assumption became a critical part of the research agenda. Long-range missiles were critical because Chinese air defenses were initially so formidable that no aircraft could get close enough to drop short-range munitions. Even stealth aircraft were at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pessimistic-scenarios&quot;&gt;Pessimistic Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nineteen iterations were run with pessimistic scenarios that incorporated excursion cases more favorable to China. The extreme “Taiwan stands alone” or “Ragnarok” scenarios are discussed separately. The large number of pessimistic iterations was driven by the operational results of the base scenario and the desire to examine how robust the base scenario outcomes would be in the face of plausible changes to assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; All 19 pessimistic iterations included the assumption that the JASSM-ER missile possesses no capability against ships at sea. As noted in the discussion of the base scenario, the JASSM had a decisive impact on outcomes, but its actual anti-ship capabilities are not well established. The first four pessimistic iterations used only the “No maritime strike JASSM” excursion case. The remaining 15 iterations included at least three additional pessimistic excursion case assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twelve of the iterations included delayed U.S. mobilization, late engagement, or larger U.S. holdouts for other ongoing contingencies. Twelve of the iterations included pessimistic assumptions about Taiwanese operational competence or ability to react to the invasion quickly. Three included U.S. rules of engagement that prohibited strikes on mainland China. One iteration included an increased number of Chinese IRBMs, and one included Japanese prohibition of JSDF offensive action outside of Japanese water or airspace, even after attacks on Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; The results of the pessimistic scenarios were significantly better for China than the base scenarios. Nevertheless, none resulted in a clear Chinese success (i.e., a Chinese occupation of Taipei or even more than a quarter of the island). Three of the 18 iterations resulted in a clear and decisive Chinese defeat, and the remainder had not produced decisive results at end of play, some 14 to 35 days into the campaign. Of those 13 cases of stalemate, 3 were judged to end “stalemate, trending toward China,” 7 were judged to end “stalemate, trending against China,” and 2 were “stalemate, indeterminate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jd77msD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Operational Results: Average and Range by Scenario Type.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stalemates judged to be trending toward China, the PLA controlled (or were soon to complete occupation of) Kaoshiung, Tainan, and much of the southern third of the island. In those cases, areas under Chinese control included several ports and airports; the United States had to devote many airstrikes against these facilities, while the Chinese raced to repair them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had the stalemated iterations been continued, the result would have been decided by the relative ability of the two sides to supply themselves from existing stocks or from new shipments to the island. For Taiwan, the United States, and its partners, this would have required running convoys to the island under air and missile attack. In China’s case, it would have required repairing logistical infrastructure while under air and missile attack. The United States was attempting to flow whatever tactical aircraft remained into the theater, while the PLA had used all of its ground-launched conventional ballistic missiles and had only a third of the long-range cruise missile inventory remaining to counter these final U.S. squadrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more pessimistic assumptions used in a scenario, the worse the outcome for the United States The three iterations run with only one pessimistic assumption (the “no maritime strike JASSM” excursion case) produced one decisive Chinese defeat and two that were trending against China. Those scenarios with additional pessimistic assumptions produced a wider range of results — with an average result significantly worse for the United States and its partners than the three more moderately pessimistic scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all the pessimistic iterations, the PLA was able to land an average of 60 battalions. The final strength of PLA forces ashore, after losses, averaged 43 battalions, or 43,000 combat soldiers and accompanying support personnel. At the end of game play, the PLA controlled an average of 6,240 km2 (or 17 percent) of Taiwan’s 36,000 km2, though, as noted, there was considerable variation between games. Finally, it should be noted that the games lasted an average of six turns (or 21 days of campaign time). Although the result was often clear at that point, getting to final resolution would require many additional weeks of combat. In the case of stalemate, the war might have continued for many months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5: PLA Situation Ashore at End of Game Play, Pessimistic Case Average.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Losses in the pessimistic scenarios (i.e., those more favorable to China) were again heavy, with average air and ground force losses higher for the United States, Japan, and China than in the base scenario and ship losses that were roughly comparable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6A4MQfC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 6: U.S., Japanese, and Chinese Air and Naval Losses, Pessimistic Case Scenario.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States lost an average of 484 aircraft, roughly 70 percent higher than in the base iterations, with the Air Force losing almost twice as many as it did in the base iterations. Greater U.S. air losses were primarily a function of campaigns that were generally longer than the relatively quick Chinese defeats experienced in the base scenario iterations. The longer time horizons allowed the United States to bring more aircraft into theater — and to lose a significant portion of them on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, with the “no maritime strike JASSM” assumption in effect, the United States relied relatively more on tactical aircraft to launch shorter-range munitions (JSMs and Joint Standoff Weapons, or JSOWs) against the Chinese fleet. This resulted in additional losses in the air as well as higher incentives for the Chinese to seek their destruction on the ground — often entirely exhausting the Chinese inventory of air- and ground-launched standoff missiles in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. air losses varied greatly from game to game, from a low of 90 to a high of 774 in these iterations. Variation was primarily a function of U.S. strategy, with some particularly aggressive teams bringing in reinforcements as quickly as possible, basing them close to Taiwan, and losing them in enormous numbers; other teams took a more cautious approach. Japanese losses averaged a third higher than in the base scenario iterations and were relatively consistent across iterations. China struck bases in Japan in every one of the pessimistic iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China lost an average of 327 aircraft per iteration, ranging from a low of 48 to a high of 826. These air losses were roughly twice as high as in the base scenario. In half of the iterations, the U.S. team attacked Chinese air bases with JASSM-ERs. These attacks destroyed between 66 and 748 aircraft, depending on the extent, scale, and target of attacks. Losses in the air were fewer than ground losses but similarly varied according to whether the U.S. team challenged the Chinese CAP over Taiwan and how aggressively the Chinese team sought to extend air operations beyond Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ship losses for the United States and Japan were similar to the base scenario. The pessimistic scenarios often provided fewer naval reinforcements during the first several weeks of the conflict. The greater surviving Chinese capabilities tended to make the U.S./Japanese player more cautious with the use of surface forces. Any surface ship that approached Taiwan was destroyed in both scenarios, and the remainder were often not a high priority for China since they posed only a limited threat to the Chinese operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese naval losses (120 ships) were 14 percent lower than in the base scenario, despite iterations that often lasted more than twice as long. Several of the assumptions in these scenarios, particularly the lack of open-ocean maritime capability for the JASSM-ER and slower or reduced U.S. reinforcements, pushed the U.S. teams to concepts of operation that required more time to bring to fruition. Nevertheless, Chinese ship losses were severe. In most of those cases where the amphibious fleet had not been destroyed outright by the end of the iteration, picket ships east of Taiwan were sufficiently attrited that the final destruction of the amphibious fleet would have occurred within days or a week thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losses from ground combat — an average of 17,000 PLA casualties and 22,000 Taiwanese — were significantly higher in pessimistic scenarios than in the base scenario because more Chinese units got onto Taiwan and could fight more intensively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical Variables: Some variables had greater impacts than others. As mentioned above, the “no maritime strike JASSM” excursion case was especially difficult for the United States. In all scenarios, the clearest, fastest, and most direct way to defeat the invasion is to attack the amphibious fleet off Taiwan using standoff munitions. Without JASSM-ER’s anti-ship capability, the ability of the United States to pursue this strategy is limited by a shortage of appropriate missiles. However, even without the ability to attack ships at sea, the JASSM-ER can contribute to defeating invasion. In the pessimistic scenarios, U.S. teams used the JASSM-ER to attack Chinese air bases and ports. The former can attrite Chinese combat aircraft and disrupt Chinese air support for operations on Taiwan, while the latter can disrupt the loading of amphibious ships or destroy them at the pier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when the U.S. rules of engagement prohibit strikes on China’s mainland, perhaps because of concerns over escalation, the assumption about the JASSM’s lack of open-ocean anti-ship capability becomes more consequential. The missile still has a role, but a much-circumscribed role. The JASSM can be used to attack captured ports and air bases on Taiwan to prevent their use by the PLA. It can also be used for strikes against Chinese ground forces on Taiwan, though it is not well suited for that role because of its unitary warhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another impactful excursion case was delayed U.S. mobilization until D-Day. In scenarios wherein the United States only begins mobilization after the start of the war and does not engage in combat operations until after the first week, China’s amphibious fleet suffered less early attrition and was, therefore, able to get far more forces ashore, putting China in a better position to make rapid gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second condition with a large impact was diminished Taiwanese ground force effectiveness and, especially, diminished reaction speed. Under conditions in which Taiwan was delayed in transferring forces from one army area to another, China was better able to make gains on the ground and consolidate its position. That was especially significant when China made its primary landing in the southern Taiwan, where the defending forces are relatively sparse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, two conditions produced a larger impact when incorporated into the scenario together than they did separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimistic-scenarios&quot;&gt;Optimistic Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumptions could just as plausibly prove incorrect in ways that might advantage the United States and its coalition. Running iterations with optimistic assumptions illustrated under what circumstances U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese losses might be lower than the base scenario. Two such iterations were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the iterations run with optimistic assumptions incorporated four optimistic assumptions, including expanded U.S. access to dual-use facilities in Japan, Chinese missile holdbacks, reduced ship defense effectiveness, and a resilient force posture on Turn 1 (i.e., no bombers on Guam or aircraft carriers forward of Guam). The second iteration incorporated seven optimistic assumptions, including: additional HASs, expanded access to Japanese dual-use facilities, Japanese authorization to use force from Turn 1, lower Chinese amphibious operational competence, superior U.S. fifth-generation aircraft, superior U.S. pilot training, and less effective ship defenses for all combatants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; Both optimistic iterations produced decisive Chinese defeats (or U.S., Taiwanese, and Japanese victories). The Chinese fleet was heavily damaged in the first three days and was unable to land more than three amphibious brigades ashore during the critical first three days, supplemented by one to two brigades of airborne and air assault forces. Follow-on waves consisted of individual battalions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Operational Results: Average and Range by Scenario Type.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, the PLA was able to land a total of 25 battalions, with a final strength of 22 battalions after losses. The force was unable to gain more than a small foothold ashore, amounting to less than a single game hex (780 km2). With the amphibious fleet effectively destroyed after the first two turns, the game was declared finished, though some combat might have sputtered along for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although escalation decisions were not part of the game, participants in the optimistic scenarios suggested that escalation might have been least likely in these scenarios since defeat was quick and there were relatively few forces ashore to rescue or support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qGecbMA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 7: PLA Situation Ashore at End of Game Play, Optimistic Case Average.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the brevity of combat operations, the optimistic scenarios produced lower losses for all combatants than other scenarios. Nevertheless, losses to the Chinese fleet were crippling, and China was still able to inflict significant losses on coalition air and naval forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QKViIt9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 8: U.S., Japanese, and Chinese Air and Naval Losses, Optimistic Case Scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Chinese amphibious ships at sea and most of the picket force were sunk. Missiles from shore batteries on Taiwan, U.S. submarines, bombers, and tactical aircraft all contributed to these sinkings. The excursion case of reduced ship-based defenses greatly accelerated the rate at which Chinese ships were sunk. With Chinese forces ashore not posing a pressing threat to Taiwanese cities or ports, the United States did not feel pressured to attack Chinese aircraft on the mainland: the relatively light Chinese aircraft losses were therefore mostly due to ground fire over Taiwan itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The China team, confronted with the prospect of extremely high and rapid losses to its amphibious fleet, sought to mitigate those losses by attacking air bases in Japan and Guam from the first days of the conflict. Despite the brevity of the campaign, China exhausted all of its long-range missile inventories against those targets, destroying many of the aircraft in Japan. However, because the United States did not have the time to flow as many aircraft into theater as in other scenarios, there were fewer aircraft for China to destroy. US air losses were only 74 percent of what they were in the base scenario and 54 percent what they were in the pessimistic scenarios. Japanese air losses were 80 percent and 70 percent of the base and pessimistic cases, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With limited ground combat, casualties to ground forces on Taiwan were similarly light. On the Chinese side, these amounted to 3 battalions rendered combat ineffective, with perhaps 3,000 Chinese casualties (including 1,000 fatalities). Casualties on the Taiwanese side were roughly twice as high, many of which were caused by Chinese aircraft conducting ground support operations. Barring a ceasefire to allow the evacuation of stranded Chinese soldiers, roughly 24,000 Chinese soldiers associated with units ashore would have been taken prisoner, in addition to the survivors from sunken ships who might have been taken prisoner after swimming to shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Variables:&lt;/strong&gt; To the extent that Chinese losses were lighter in this set of scenarios than in others, the outcome was a function of the shorter scenario combined with U.S. and partner priorities that were affected by the conditions of the scenario, as described above. If no off-ramp to peace were found, Chinese naval and air losses would continue to climb (in the former case limited by the size of the fleet and in the latter probably more dramatically as the United States turned its attention to attacking aircraft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three factors significantly reduced U.S. losses in both iterations: dispersion across more locations (including civilian airports), reduced missile coverage on the part of China (due to missile holdouts and less-well-optimized warheads), and early attacks on Japanese air bases. The latter was motivated by the increased danger to the Chinese fleet posed by tactical aircraft and resulted in fewer aircraft being at the bases when attacked since fewer reinforcements had flowed in from other U.S. bases around the world. Additionally, the building of new HASs reduced aircraft losses in one of the iterations, while not placing bombers in Guam or aircraft carriers forward deployed reduced aircraft losses in the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two optimistic assumptions had little impact: superior U.S. pilot training and superior fifth-generation aircraft. There was little air-to-air combat in the optimistic scenarios, largely because of the employment of long-range standoff munitions. Had a mix of pessimistic and optimistic assumptions been in play, it is possible that superiority of U.S. air-to-air combat capability might have been more significant. However, it probably would not have factored among the most important variables due to most U.S. air losses occurring on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwan-stands-alone&quot;&gt;Taiwan Stands Alone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; The “Taiwan stands alone” scenario was designed to examine how Taiwan might fare with no direct material assistance from the United States. This provides a baseline against which to measure the U.S. and partner contribution to the defense of Taiwan. The project team conducted one iteration of this scenario. Because the United States remained on the sidelines, the assumption was that no other country would intervene because the risks would be too high for any second-tier power. None of the excursion cases run in the other scenarios were incorporated into this scenario, but this scenario did have two unique assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Taiwan’s operations would be weakened by a long-term shortage in ammunition. The scenario assumed that after two months of operations, ammunition shortages would force Taiwan to fire half as frequently, with a corresponding reduction in effectiveness. After three months, ammunition exhaustion forces artillery crews to be reformed into infantry units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China would need to withhold some aircraft to deter U.S. and Japanese intervention, even if that intervention was ultimately not forthcoming. This had the effect of limiting the number of aircraft supporting Chinese ground forces on Taiwan. After withholding squadrons for deterrence, China was left with 14 squadrons for ground support, with 6 additional squadrons to replace losses as they occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Xi3bdw0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 7: Operational Results: Average and Range by Scenario Type.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; The “Taiwan stands alone” scenario resulted in a PLA victory. The outcome was never in doubt, with the PLA making slow but steady progress throughout the operation. PLA commanders landed forces in the south, took Tainan and Gaoshiung after three weeks, and occupied Taichung (halfway up the coast) by the end of the sixth week. Frustrated with slow progress up the west side of the island and with ground forces to spare, PLA commanders then opened a second front at Hualian. PLA armor occupied the president’s palace in Taipei after 10 weeks. In the actual event of a Chinese invasion without third-party intervention, the Taiwanese government might capitulate before the bitter end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the iteration, Taiwan’s commander flowed forces to meet the attack and defended successive river lines. To dislodge those positions, China brought up heavy armor, engineering support, and artillery. However, transporting these units to the island required substantial time. To dislodge particularly stubborn positions, the PLA also dispatched light infantry forces to work around the flanks in the foothills of Taiwan’s steep mountains. Once defenses were broken or flanks were turned, Taiwanese forces retreated to the next river line and continued the fight. A close parallel to the scenario is the Allied campaign in Italy in World War II, where the Germans withdrew slowly, defending each river and mountain ridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the two-and-a-half-month campaign, the PLA landed a total of 230 battalions on Taiwan. Despite Taiwanese shore-based ASCMs, the amphibious fleet remained viable throughout the campaign. PLA commanders were able to transport the engineers necessary to repair damage to ports and airports as they were captured. When Taipei fell, 165 Chinese battalions were on the island (another 65 battalions having been rendered combat ineffective). This force was more than four times the number present at the end of the base scenario iterations involving U.S. intervention. Including personnel not associated with combat battalions, this force might number 300,000, a number comparable to the invasion force considered for Operation Causeway, the planned U.S. 1945 invasion of Taiwan that was never launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MDPEkTV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 9: PLA Situation Ashore at End of Game Play, “Taiwan Stands Alone”.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the results are sobering, the campaign was also enlightening in other ways. If Taiwanese forces are willing to fight, Chinese forces would require a prolonged period of combat before occupying Taiwan’s major cities. This buys time for a delayed U.S. intervention or international diplomacy. Regardless, the results show how much damage resilient Taiwanese armed forces can inflict. Increasing their lethality and survivability would also likely enhance deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Casualties were high in this campaign because of the protracted and intensive nature of ground combat. However, the composition of losses was very different from other scenarios. PLA ground forces suffered roughly 70,000 casualties in ground combat, including 23,100 killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the first 10 days of combat, Taiwanese anti-ship shore batteries sank 17 amphibious ships and the same number of escort ships (roughly 16 percent of PLA totals in both categories) before being destroyed or running out of missiles. With Taiwan’s navy having been defeated by missile, air, submarine, and surface attack, and the surviving elements of Taiwan’s air force struggling to survive, no additional losses were inflicted on China’s fleet. However, the PLAAF suffered attrition from ground fire and SAMs throughout the campaign, losing a total of 240 aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with every scenario, Taiwan lost its entire navy. The Taiwanese air force squadrons that survived China’s joint fires strike were eventually destroyed in air-to-air combat. Its army suffered 85,000 casualties, with perhaps 28,000 killed. Casualties amounted to roughly half of its total mobilized army strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ragnarok&quot;&gt;Ragnarok&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; The “Ragnarok” scenario was designed to ascertain what conditions would be necessary for China to be victorious in the face of Taiwanese resistance and U.S. intervention. The need for a special scenario became clear after China failed to secure a total victory in a range of pessimistic scenarios. This scenario should therefore not be taken as a likely future but rather as a tool to illustrate what would be necessary to invalidate the project’s main result (that China is unlikely to succeed if Taiwan resists and the United States intervenes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be victorious, China must negate U.S. airpower, both fighter attack and bombers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. fighter/attack aircraft could not effectively participate in operations if Tokyo remained strictly neutral and did not allow the United States to operate from its bases in Japan. While it is possible to use tankers with aircraft based on Guam, this would (1) be vulnerable on the ground to Chinese ballistic missiles, (2) be vulnerable in the air if tankers were intercepted, and (3) be unable to generate enough sorties over Taiwan to significantly affect the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China would need to negate U.S. bombers. This is hard to do because bombers can be based beyond the range of most Chinese ground-attack missiles, approach the theater from several angles, and launch standoff missiles beyond the range of defending SAMs. If China attempted to interdict U.S. bombers with its surface ships, then the United States could attrite these ships down until it had created a path to the amphibious fleet (not unlike most other scenarios, wherein the United States must attrite the pickets east of Taiwan). An extreme-range SAM would be limited by the curvature of the Earth and therefore be unable to intercept U.S. bombers before they fired their missiles. However, without U.S. fighters based in Japan for escorts, U.S. bombers would be vulnerable to Chinese fighters armed with extreme-range air-to-air missiles. Alternatively, if China either did not have these missiles or could not complete a kill chain with them, the United States could negate its own bombers by failing to procure sufficient long-range, air-launched ASCMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; As expected, Ragnarok ended in a PLA victory. Without having to worry about U.S. forces in Japan, the PLA was able to focus its land-attack missiles on Guam, negating it as a base. Despite the absence of U.S. bombers, the Chinese amphibious fleet still took a large number of casualties from ASCMs on Taiwan and U.S. SSNs infiltrating into the straits. By the time these attackers were out of ammunition or attrited, they had reduced the amphibious fleet to one-third of its beginning strength. However, the absence of U.S. fighter/attack aircraft allowed the Chinese to focus their aircraft on supporting the ground invasion. This allowed the PLA to make steady progress ashore and eventually compensate for destroyed amphibious ships with captured ports and airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last serious challenge to the invasion came from an unsuccessful attack by the massed U.S. fleet. After three weeks of conflict, a U.S. fleet of 29 cruisers and destroyers, two carriers, and 10 SSNs approached Taiwan. Under withering fire from Chinese submarines, air-launched ASCMs, and surface ships, the US fleet was largely destroyed without relieving Taiwan. At this point, the game was called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Casualties in this scenario were very different from other scenarios. The only U.S. aircraft that were destroyed were either on Guam initially or flew from carriers. The reliance on SSNs meant that 10 SSNs were lost even before the climactic naval showdown. In total, the United States lost four carriers, 43 cruisers and destroyers, and 15 SSNs. If Taiwan continued to fight to the end, their casualties would be similar to those in the “Taiwan stands alone” scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Variables:&lt;/strong&gt; This scenario demonstrated the centrality of two variables: basing in Japan and the ability of the United States to deliver ASCMs en masse. Without the ability of U.S. aircraft to operate out of Japan, the PLAAF can concentrate against targets in Taiwan while the PLA delivers more troops ashore. While U.S. bombers could hypothetically still deliver a decisive amount of ordnance, the outcome would rest on their effectiveness. This could be neutralized either by PLA advances in anti-air missiles or by insufficient stockpiles of standoff anti-ship missiles. Without U.S. airpower, Taiwanese ground-launched ASCMs and U.S. SSNs are insufficient to defeat a Chinese invasion; furthermore, the vulnerability of surface ships prevents the U.S. surface fleet from being effective. While it must be emphasized that this was an unlikely scenario, it is analytically helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the excursion assumptions noted in Chapter 4 (“Assumptions and Excursions”) were included in some subset of the scenarios. Based on outcomes and analysis of game play, it is apparent that some of these had a larger impact than others (see Figure 8 below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those that worked to China’s advantage, two had a particularly pronounced impact. First was “Taiwan stands alone,” in which Taiwan had no support from the United States or other allies and fell to China’s inexorable advance. Second was “Japan neutral,” in which Japan does not permit U.S. basing, limiting U.S. operations to those that could be sustained from Guam, Hawaii, Alaska, or at-sea naval forces. Three others had significant and notable effects. The “U.S. combat starts D plus 14” excursion case saw late intervention by the United States and allowed China to establish more forces ashore before suffering major attrition to its amphibious fleet. The “no maritime strike JASSM” excursion case slowed attrition of the Chinese fleet. The “Taiwanese forces paralyzed to D plus 4” excursion case prevented Taiwan from rapidly reinforcing the beachhead and enabled Chinese forces ashore to expand the beachhead during the first days after landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those excursion assumptions that favored the United States and its partners, two were particularly important in affecting operational outcomes. First, the “ship defenses poor” excursion case resulted in the rapid sinking of amphibious ships and their escorts and further diminished China’s prospects. Second, the “reduced PLA amphibious competence” excursion case similarly diminished the already limited number of troops that China can land on beaches during a given period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two excursion cases diminished U.S. losses during the campaign while maintaining Taiwanese autonomy. The “U.S., Japan can use large Japanese airports” excursion case permits the dispersion of U.S. and Japanese aircraft over more facilities and reduces the impact of Chinese missile attacks against allied airpower. The “no U.S. show of force” excursion case allows the U.S. team to start its carriers, bombers, and tankers outside of China’s primary threat rings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 8 summarizes in graphic form the impact of changing assumptions. The direction of arrows indicates whether the change benefits the Chinese invasion (to the left) or the Taiwanese defense (to the right). The significance of the assumption is denoted by the length of the arrow and its color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base scenario produced relatively rapid and clear Chinese defeat, a result produced largely by the ability of U.S., Taiwanese, and Japanese anti-ship missiles to destroy the Chinese amphibius fleet before the PLA forces ashore can capture ports and airports to increase the force flow across the strait. Optimistic scenarios (favoring the United States and its partners) produced the same results but more quickly and with lower casualties. Pessimistic scenarios (favoring China) produced more protracted fighting and a wider range of operational outcomes, ranging from decisive Chinese defeat to stalemates in which China controlled damaged ports and airports. The “Taiwan stands alone” scenario produced inexorable Chinese advance, concluding with the Chinese occupation of the entire island — an unambiguous PLA victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losses in all iterations were high and sobering for both sides. In all but the “Taiwan stands alone” scenario, China lost the large preponderance of its surface fleet, including amphibious ships, surface combatants, and carriers as well as a portion of its submarine fleet. In most iterations, the U.S. Navy lost two carriers and more than a dozen surface ships as well as four submarines. It was only able to avoid that outcome in optimistic scenarios because the United States did not push its fleet forward as a deterrent signal prior to the start of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air losses varied greatly for both sides. On the U.S. side, they numbered in the hundreds under all scenarios and averaged 283 in the base scenario, 484 in pessimistic scenarios, and 200 in optimistic scenarios. Across all iterations, U.S. aircraft losses ranged from a low of 90 to a high of 774. Japan also lost more than 100 aircraft in most iterations, and Taiwan lost its entire air force. Chinese aircraft losses varied greatly, as the United States only attacked Chinese air bases in iterations run under pessimistic assumptions — and in only half of those. Chinese air losses averaged 161 under the base scenario, 327 under pessimistic assumptions, and 290 under optimistic scenarios. Chinese air losses varied from a low of dozens to a high of 748.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground losses varied primarily according to the duration of the campaign and the number of forces landed on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-are-these-results-different-from-classified-dod-games&quot;&gt;Why Are These Results Different from Classified DOD Games?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this project find that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be difficult and fail under most conditions when the purported results of classified wargames indicate much higher chances of Chinese success, as do the intuitive views of many commentators who see the large disparity of forces in the Western Pacific between China and Taiwan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in Chapter 2, publicly available information on the results of classified wargames indicates high U.S. casualties and unfavorable outcomes. The amount of information is limited, however, because of the restrictions regarding classified information. Nevertheless, examination of public descriptions of classified wargames and what is known about the conduct of wargames in general allows the project to make informed guesses about why results differ between the classified games and this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invasions Are Difficult to Model with the Method of Pks:&lt;/strong&gt; Classified models tend to prioritize the method of Pks over the method of history because of the richness of data on individual systems that is available at the classified level. However, this might lead classified wargames to overestimate the quickness at which amphibious invasions would proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task of loading and transporting troops, landing on a hostile shore, building up forces, and then moving inland is inherently difficult. In 1944, the United States considered an invasion of Taiwan as the next step in the Pacific campaign. The move was rejected because of the difficulty. As Ben Jensen, a CSIS expert on wargaming, noted: “Crossing a contested sea only to fight on complex, canalized terrain against a deliberate defense-in-depth makes amphibious assault in Taiwan a more complex operation than even the famed 1944 Operation Overlord — the D-Day landings. Taiwan is a particularly difficult target because it has only about a dozen suitable landing beaches and the terrain inland is highly defensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another insight comes from the naval author and historian C.S. Forrester in his thought piece “If Hitler Had Invaded England.” In it, he considered how a German invasion of Britain in the summer of 1940 might have played out. Germany faced a problem like that of China — a powerful army facing a contested air and naval environment that made crossing even a narrow strip of water difficult. There was an invasion plan, called Operation Sealion, which the Germans prepared for but ultimately did not execute because it lacked the air and naval supremacy needed. In his counterfactual history, Forrester gives the Germans every advantage. The Germans can land successfully with paratroopers and amphibious forces, but the British response in the air and on the sea throttled sustainment and reinforcement. British army counterattacks defeated the now isolated German troops on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The many successful Allied amphibious operations of World War II made opposed landings look easy. They are not. The allies were successful because of many years spent refining doctrine and building specialized capabilities. Learning steps such as the catastrophic raid on Dieppe in 1943 were part of that learning process. The Chinese will not have those opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different Purposes:&lt;/strong&gt; As noted in Chapter 2, wargames have different purposes, not all of which are intended to simulate the most likely course of events. For example, some games test concepts and are not intended to represent likely futures. Such a game might assume that Chinese forces land in the Philippines to see whether U.S. forces could use mobility, anti-air capabilities, and anti-ship missiles to contest the invasion. Other games might hypothesize U.S. forces being on islands in the South China Sea or the Philippines and attempting to prevent the breakout of Chinese naval forces from the first island chain. (These are actual scenarios for the game, Littoral Commander: The Indo-Pacific.) These games are useful to test concepts about weapons capabilities and force structure. Because the scenarios are improbable, however, they are not particularly helpful in trying to ascertain the course of future events. To use the Philippines example, it is hard to imagine a set of circumstances where Chinese amphibious forces would land on the main islands of the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many U.S.-China wargames have short time increments, which allows detailed assessment of forces and weapons but means that game play covers only the first few days of a conflict. This is the time of greatest U.S. and partner weakness, after initial Chinese attacks but before substantial reinforcements begin to flow. Thus, results can give a skewed sense of what the whole campaign might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to the notion of testing concepts is the notion that wargames can be designed to “stress test” for potential weaknesses in new operational concepts. David Ochmanek, a senior analyst at RAND and experienced wargamer, noted this purpose: “Even the games that the United States loses are not necessarily reflective of how a war would unfold in real life; the main purpose is to evaluate American vulnerabilities. We learn a lot from these.” This is a reasonable approach when evaluating risk or exploring policy boundaries. However, the results of particularly pessimistic scenarios do not constitute the most likely results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many games are intended primarily to educate the players. Game designers often want to challenge the players and counteract complacency. This is a reasonable approach for educating an officer corps about what future conflict might entail, especially since the officer corps has been accustomed to having military superiority for generations. However, the outcomes of these games do not necessarily represent a full spectrum of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjudication by Judgment vs. Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Another difference might be the adjudication mechanism. Many classified wargames are conducted as seminars, where two sides discuss a scenario and a “white team” adjudicates the results of moves by the two teams. Results, therefore, are heavily dependent on the personal perspectives of the white team members. To combat this source of possible bias, the project developed explicit adjudication mechanisms based on historical experience. (This is described in detail in Chapter 2.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asymmetric Assumptions about Capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Another possibility is attributing a high level of capabilities and abilities to the Chinese while decrementing U.S. capabilities because of known limitations. This might be done as a hedging mechanism to avoid underestimating a potential adversary. Some analyses, reflected in the fictional speculation of 2034 and Ghost Fleet, hypothesize powerful and previously unknown Chinese capabilities, such as cyber in one case and space weapons in the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attribution of high capabilities to adversaries has a long history. A classic example occurred before the Persian Gulf War of 1991. There was an intensive period of wargaming prior to the war, with the gaming of scenarios related to an attack on Kuwait occurring more than a year before the actual attack and the first planning scenarios for the counterattack commencing the same day as the Iraqi invasion. Gaming was also used to develop several aspects of the final operations plan. However, results depended heavily on whether Iraq’s military was viewed as “war hardened” or “war weary” as a result of its recently concluded eight-year war with Iran. A war-hardened military would fight fiercely and skillfully. Comparison was often made to the North Vietnamese. A war-weary military might collapse quickly. Modeling took Iraqi forces at face value. This was a reasonable hedge, but models produced predictions for U.S. casualties several orders of magnitude higher than the actual casualty figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 provides a more recent example. At the beginning of the conflict, many commentators suggested that the campaign would result in a decisive Russian victory. This analysis was founded on the perceived increase in military effectiveness following what was purported to be an extensive modernization of the Russian military. However, this modernization did not translate to battlefield effectiveness, with warfighting shortcomings becoming apparent following the invasion, new systems not performing as assessed, and forces not fighting as expected. There was an expectation of technical and tactical competency built into assessments that have not been in evidence following the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deception:&lt;/strong&gt; During the Soviet period, the United States routinely overestimated Soviet strategic nuclear capabilities. This occurred in part because the Soviets were actively trying to deceive Western intelligence agencies and in part because of Western concerns about avoiding complacency and surprise. Thus, the United States hypothesized a “bomber gap” when the Soviets flew the same bombers repeatedly over reviewing stands during a May Day celebration, thus giving the impression of having more long-range strike aircraft than they in fact had. Looking back on this incident, John Pardos concluded in his study of U.S. intelligence estimates of the Soviet strategic forces, “where organizational interests impinge or turn upon certain conclusions, objective analysis of intelligence is likely to suffer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-the-war-play-out&quot;&gt;How Does the War Play Out?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter lays out the broad features of the conflict, as it played out over the 24 game iterations. It also discusses some of the strategies pursued before moving, in Chapter 7, to the conclusions and recommendations derived from the course of these games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-situation-on-taiwan&quot;&gt;The Situation on Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the conflict starts, Chinese air and naval units surrounded the island. The resulting Chinese defensive zone was so dense that no cargo ships could get through, and the danger to airlift aircraft was extreme. In one iteration, an attempt to insert a U.S. Army brigade onto Taiwan by air resulted in two of the three battalions (roughly 2,000 soldiers) being destroyed in the air. The U.S. Maritime Prepositioning Ships (MPS) squadron, which is designed to rapidly deploy large ground formations, could not get through. Taiwan as isolated. The United States could not move any significant forces onto Taiwan within the month that the game covers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese were always able to get troops onto Taiwan. The Taiwan Strait is so narrow, the Chinese forces so numerous, and Taiwanese defenses so limited that defeating the invasion at sea was not possible. The Chinese challenge is sustaining the forces landed on the island while bringing in new forces before the Taiwanese can contain the beachhead and counterattack in strength. The steady attrition inflicted by U.S. attacks on China’s amphibious shipping imposes a time constraint on the Chinese invasion. However, once China captures an operational port or airfield, it can use civilian merchant ships and cargo planes to supply its invasion, easing demands on the amphibious fleet. The central question is whether Chinese forces can capture airfields and ports — and keep them operating — before U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese attacks sink their amphibious ships. In the base scenario and most others, this was not achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese supplemented the beach assault with airborne forces. When these attempted to seize airfields, they generally failed because of the weak combat power that airborne forces possess. This record is consistent with the mixed results of German attempts to employ airborne troops in seizing airfields during the invasion of Crete and Russians in Hostomel. When airborne forces attempted to isolate the battle area, they were more successful and assisted Chinese amphibious forces in establishing a significant beachhead ashore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With limited ability to land substantial firepower during the early days of conflict, China’s ability to advance off the beaches and establish a larger lodgment depended heavily on airpower. One role was to provide close air support to attacking forces. More important was the interdiction role, destroying bridges and overpasses that might be used by Taiwanese reinforcements moving to reinforce defenses around the beachhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The central question is whether Chinese forces can capture airfields and ports — and keep them operating — before U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese attacks sink their amphibious ships. In the base scenario and most others, this was not achieved.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. airpower, for its part, had a limited ability to influence ground combat directly. China’s naval and air forces restricted U.S. strikes to standoff weapons, such as the JASSM-ER. Their unitary warheads were effective against ports and airfields but not against troops in the field because of their dispersion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese players considered attacking the northern part of the island where Taipei, the capital, is located. In this, they sought to replay Germany’s amphibious and airborne assault on Norway’s capital of Oslo in 1940 or Russia’s attack on Kyiv in 2022. However, the Chinese players were generally dissuaded by the strength of defending Taiwanese forces deployed in the north around Taipei. About 46 percent of Taiwan’s total battalions are in the northern third of the island, including half of Taiwan’s mechanized forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in 21 of 24 iterations, the Chinese invasion force landed in the south, where Taiwanese defenses were lighter. This made it easier to get ashore and establish a beachhead or airhead but meant that the Chinese forces had to fight their way up the entire island to capture the capital and achieve a decisive result. The nature of the terrain is not, however, propitious for such an advance. The central parts of Taiwan are mountainous and difficult to traverse. The coastal plains are narrow, with rivers and cities that provide good defensive positions. Even capturing the large southern city of Kaohsiung was often a difficult and time-consuming task. Nevertheless, the southern landings met with greater success than did the few attempts at direct attack on the north. Interestingly, when U.S. planners considered invading Taiwan in 1944, they also planned to land in the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 21 of 24 iterations, the Chinese invasion force landed in the south, where Taiwanese defenses were lighter.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, this campaign would not be a close parallel to that confronting German commanders at Normandy on the so-called “longest day.” Then, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel believed that the coming Allied invasion of France had to be defeated on the beaches during the first 24 hours. If the invasion became established ashore, Allied air and naval power could sustain it. In 1944, that proved correct, but it does not apply to the challenge facing Taiwan today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be different because the Chinese invasion fleet, though numerous, is not nearly as large as the fleet that supported the D-Day invasion. For that operation, the Allies had 229 amphibious ships (LSTs) and 345 troop ships and cargo ships for a total of 547 ships, serviced by more than 3,000 smaller landing craft (LCIs, LCMs, LCTs, and LCVs). The anticipated Chinese amphibious fleet of 2026 includes 28 LSTs, 18 LHD/LPDs, 20 LSMs, and 30 large civilian RO-ROs, for a total of 96 ships, serviced by 305 landing craft. At Normandy, the Allies put 90,000 troops ashore on the first day, whereas the Chinese can put about 8,000 ashore on D-day/Taiwan (or 16,000 in 3.5 days). Thus, Chinese capabilities are much less than Allied capabilities on D-Day, and a successful initial lodgment does not guarantee eventual success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, Allied forces had a virtual air and naval monopoly in 1944. The Luftwaffe had been diverted to operations over the homeland and in the east. The U-boat fleet, the only significant remaining German naval force, could not penetrate Allied screens. The Allies could build up forces ashore without serious opposition. If Taiwan faced China alone, the Chinese would have the same air and naval dominance. U.S. participation means that the airspace and seas around Taiwan would be vigorously contested, and the proliferation of long-range precision strike assets means that U.S. airpower could inflict steady losses on the Chinese fleet from long distances. Thus, establishing a beachhead is not enough to ensure a Chinese victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In World War II, the Japanese faced this same choice: defend on the beach or inland. Initially, they tried to defeat amphibious assaults on the beaches but found that impossible. They then shifted to a defense in depth, forcing the invader to take heavy casualties by attacking prepared fortifications inland. Thus, the capture of Iwo Jima and Okinawa involved prolonged and bloody campaigns ashore. For Taiwan, a prolonged campaign would allow time for U.S. intervention or a diplomatic solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In three iterations, the Chinese captured the island of Penghu off the west coast of Taiwan, planning to use the island as a staging base for an attack on the main island. Although they defeated Taiwanese forces there, their dwindling amphibious capabilities prevented a successful invasion of the main island. Thus, occupying Penghu during a campaign to invade Taiwan proper was an operational dead end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project did not examine whether capturing Penghu would succeed as a limited attack for intimidation and bargaining or as part of a longer-term strategy in which Penghu was used as a base of operations to stage forces for an attack on mainland Taiwan several years later. Penghu is politically important because, unlike the other offshore islands closer to the Chinese coast, it was explicitly included in the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and Republic of China (Taiwan). The islands were also included in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. Thus, the fallout from a limited Chinese operation to seize Penghu bears separate investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Taiwanese success in frustrating the Chinese invasion is tempered by the extensive damage done to the Taiwanese infrastructure and economy. Almost all Chinese players launched massive interdiction strikes against transportation infrastructure to prevent Taiwanese forces from moving to the beachhead invasion sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3hV1PgV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 9: Penghu Province.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another element was the major battles in port cities and around airfields as the Chinese sought to capture a facility to increase the flow of forces and supplies. The Taiwanese player sometimes sabotaged civilian airfields and ports to prevent them from falling into Chinese hands. Indeed, a few players employed a “scorched earth” strategy that preemptively destroyed the most vulnerable ports and airfields. In these cases, the Taiwanese player judged that the existential threat to Taiwan justified such destruction. As a military tactic, it was highly successful. However, because a port or airfield that is unusable for military purposes is also unusable for civilian purposes, this strategy did immense damage to the transportation hubs on which the Taiwanese economy depends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The U.S. and Taiwanese success in frustrating the Chinese invasion is tempered by the extensive damage done to the Taiwanese infrastructure and economy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battles for cities near invasion beaches would inevitably cause heavy damage and loss of life in residential or commercial areas. Several players also argued that destroying Taiwanese industry and infrastructure would disrupt global supply chains and have effects far beyond the region. Taiwanese manufacturers account for 61 percent of global revenue in semiconductor manufacturing for 16-nm or smaller chips, and it is even more dominant in the manufacturing of the most advanced semiconductors. As a result, every nation on the planet would feel the effects of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-bloody-air-and-maritime-battle&quot;&gt;THE BLOODY AIR AND MARITIME BATTLE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the wargame’s larger operational map, air and sea missions are plotted over hundreds and often thousands of kilometers. Despite the distances involved, proximity matters, especially when persistence around the battle area is required. For example, U.S. bases on Okinawa are the closest U.S. bases to Taiwan, and air units flying air superiority missions from Okinawa can remain “on station” around Taiwan for longer periods of time than aircraft flying from more distant bases. However, proximity puts assets deep inside adversary threat rings and increases vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce exposure, players often exploited the full range of their systems. They launched air strikes, which require less persistence than air superiority missions, from extreme ranges. U.S. aircraft sortied from bases in northern Japan or even Guam and, with the assistance of tankers, struck targets in the Taiwan Strait or on mainland China. China, for its part, husbanded bombers in its inland bases and launched strikes from those deep bastions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the geographic scope of the “outer” air and naval battle, these operations nevertheless had a strategic center, revolving around the centrality of tasks on or near Taiwan. The focus of most teams remained squarely on the primary tasks at hand. For U.S. teams, this was the destruction of China’s amphibious fleet, without which China cannot achieve victory. For China, this involved protecting the amphibious fleet, landing as many troops ashore as possible and supporting them, to the maximum extent possible, with airpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opposing Strategies to Attack and Defend the Invasion Fleet:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s success or failure hinges largely on its ability to defend the amphibious fleet long enough to achieve its objectives ashore. Much of the maritime and air battle therefore revolves around the U.S. effort to sink that fleet, and China’s effort to defend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and partner forces have many potent assets they can bring to bear in this fight. Taiwan’s ground-based anti-ship missiles can engage from the outset and impose modest attrition on the fleet until those that are not destroyed by Chinese air and missile strikes are expended, which generally occurs in the second week of the conflict. Submarines are inherently stealthy and can also reliably inflict attrition on the Chinese fleet. However, submarines carry a limited number of munitions, so while they can impose steady attrition, submarines must periodically return to port to rearm, and their effect therefore plays out over an extended period of time. Given the high carrying capacity and rapid rearm times of aircraft, bombers and fighters equipped with long-range anti-ship missiles provide the most potent threat to Chinese shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, Chinese players adopted a two-pronged strategy to blunt these attacks. Defensively, the Chinese teams established a layered presence between the amphibious fleet and threats to it. They deployed some SAGs around the immediate perimeter of the amphibious fleet. Most sent SAGs to serve as air- and missile-defense pickets east of Taiwan and, beyond that, dispatched submarines into the Philippine Sea and Western Pacific to intercept and attack U.S. surface fleets. At the same time, Chinese teams employed offensive operations to strike U.S. (and often Japanese) naval forces whenever they could be located, and most teams attacked U.S. air bases throughout Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s more strictly defensive activities followed a predictable path. The Chinese picket forces, when deployed, successfully blunted U.S. attacks on the amphibious fleet for a while. However, in most iterations, the United States eventually overwhelmed the picket force with massive air and missile strikes of their own because the Chinese did not have enough combat aircraft and tankers both to provide CAP for these ships and conduct other high-priority operations (strikes and ground support over Taiwan). The use of the PLAN as a kind of “ablative” armor for the amphibious ships, while effective, resulted in heavy Chinese casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the approach outlined above represents a sound Chinese approach, the results were mixed. Chinese submarines inflicted some attrition on U.S. naval forces, though the large expanse to be patrolled, the prevalence of diesel boats in the Chinese fleet, and anti-submarine operations by the United States and Japan generally limited damage. More potent were Chinese long-range missile strikes and massed missiles strikes, which almost always succeeded in overcoming U.S. naval defenses. Typically, the United States lost both forward-deployed carriers within the first turn or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China’s high-end anti-ship missiles were often exhausted relatively early. If the games had continued for additional weeks, it is likely that subsequent attacks (if they had taken place) would have been less lethal. By then, however, the battle on Taiwan might have been largely decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China Devastates U.S. Air Bases:&lt;/strong&gt; As noted in previous chapters, the base case assumes that Japan remains neutral but allows U.S. forces to conduct combat operations from U.S. bases in Japan, including from Kadena, Iwakuni, Yokota, and Misawa. These bases are of tremendous value for the United States. Aircraft based in Japan can strike Chinese ships around Taiwan and escort bombers coming from Alaska or Hawaii. Aircraft flying from Kadena or southern Japan can also spend more time over Taiwan conducting air superiority operations and do not need as much aerial refueling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the PLARF has many TBMs and ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs) that can range Japan. These highly accurate missiles, many of whose warheads are equipped with submunitions, could blanket all of the military air bases in Japan. The PLAAF’s air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) supplement these ground-launched systems. Thus, China can conduct devastating attacks on air bases in Japan, sometimes including the element of surprise, despite the risk that such an attack would draw the JSDF into the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether to attack Japan was a critical decision for the Chinese player. As the chart below shows, the Chinese player usually did so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tjv0hlF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 10: Chinese Attacks against Japan.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently, the Chinese player did not attack immediately, being cautious about bringing Japan into the conflict and wanting to conserve the large but still finite inventory of missiles until they might have maximum effect. However, as the United States built up forces on Japanese bases and used these as sanctuaries to attack Chinese air and naval forces, the Chinese player then decided to attack. This delayed attack was highly effective, destroying hundreds of massed U.S. and Japanese aircraft on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Chinese players attacked U.S. forces in Japan, they attacked Japanese forces also, destroying many Japanese aircraft and surface ships. Surviving JSDF fought back, despite the initial losses caused by Chinese TBMs. Most valuable were the Japanese submarines, which could strike Chinese amphibious ships and the Chinese picket line around Taiwan. Also valuable were surviving Japanese aircraft and the country’s significant ASW capabilities. JASDF aircraft added to the CAP over Taiwan and strikes on the Chinese amphibious fleet. Japan’s extensive fleet of MPA and its network of undersea sensors played an important role in attriting China’s fleet of submarines. Like the U.S. surface fleet, the Japanese surface fleet had to maintain a cautious distance from Taiwan until the Chinese missile threat eased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those situations where Japan entered the war, its submarines stayed east or north of Taiwan to avoid fratricide with U.S. submarines. East of Taiwan, JMSDF submarines attacked the Chinese picket line to allow U.S. and Japanese airpower to strike more easily at the amphibious ships; north of Taiwan, they attacked Chinese amphibious ships departing ports outside of the Taiwan Strait. One caution in assessing these results is that these Japanese actions reflect the preferences of U.S. players. They may not reflect the actions of the Japanese government, which might hold substantial forces back for defense of the homeland or put other restrictions on the use of forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy of attacking Japan worked for China in an operational sense. The benefit of eliminating air bases near Taiwan exceeded the negative effects of having the JSDF join the United States. The results of those games in which China did not attack were poorer for China than those in which it did. This judgment, however, does not consider long-term political and diplomatic costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategies-for-resource-constraints-priorities-and-risk&quot;&gt;Strategies for Resource Constraints, Priorities, and Risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final observation about the course of conflict was that both sides often had to make trade-offs and balance risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major area of trade-offs was that both sides wanted to undertake more activities than they had the forces to execute. For example, many China teams discussed placing air patrols east of Taiwan to protect the fleet or even over the Ryukyu Islands to disrupt U.S. and Japanese air strikes. However, the distances involved and the lack of Chinese tankers would have made the missions unwise in view of the other heavy demands on airpower. Most China teams therefore focused the air effort on maintaining air superiority over Taiwan itself and providing air support to ground forces ashore on Taiwan. Chinese players who tried to pursue multiple goals, such as protecting the homeland while invading Taiwan, quickly failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and Japanese teams were confronted with similar dilemmas. While most saw value in contesting China’s air presence over Taiwan with fighter sweeps and CAP, the top priority was conducting strikes against the amphibious fleet. Periodic Chinese missile against U.S. and Japanese air bases often left the U.S.-Japan alliance with insufficient aircraft to conduct both air superiority operations and strikes simultaneously. In cases where Chinese ground forces took ports and airports, the need to strike and damage those facilities lest they be used to facilitate additional lift heightened the U.S. dilemma. Similar choices confronted players on those infrequent occasions when U.S. players sought to escort transport aircraft into Taiwan, as forming escort groups would reduce commitments to other forms of missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to dilemmas driven by having more tasks than resources, the teams confronted choices about how to balance the risk of suffering unsustainable casualties against the risk of applying insufficient force to achieve objectives. This was especially true of the U.S. team, which begins the conflict on its back foot and in possession of a brittle force posture. Initial Chinese missile strikes destroy much of the U.S. forward-deployed aircraft and naval strength. Although the United States receives a steady stream of air and naval reinforcements, it takes time to build up powerful capabilities in theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States takes a defensive stance until these reinforcements arrive, China can seize ports and airports and establish a secure position on the island. Delay cedes the opportunity to attack Chinese forces before they can build forces ashore on Taiwan. On the other hand, massing forward too aggressively to maximize striking power leads to crippling losses from Chinese missile attacks. The game records suggest that extreme answers to this dilemma are punished. The two iterations in which airpower was thrust forward most aggressively (#12 and #13) resulted in very high U.S. air losses (774 and 750 aircraft, respectively) and stalemated outcomes, while the most cautious strategy (#18) produced lower aircraft losses (392 aircraft) but also failed to produce a favorable operational outcome. Iterations in which players adopted more mixed strategies (#4 and #16) appeared to fare relatively better. This dilemma was most severe in pessimistic scenarios, and all the examples mentioned here are drawn from those cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The teams confronted choices about how to balance the risk of suffering unsustainable casualties against the risk of applying insufficient force to achieve objectives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Domains Are Important but not Decisive:&lt;/strong&gt; No players used direct-ascent weapons against adversary satellite constellations because of concerns about losing their own capabilities. It was a classic case of mutual deterrence. In counterspace operations, both sides contented themselves with electronic warfare and dazzling. They also launched co-orbital attacks that would only unfold beyond the time scale of a Taiwan operation. While space is a critical warfighting domain, it was relatively static in these scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides employed offensive cyber actions, but again without decisive effect. One excursion case explored a delayed Taiwanese reaction to invasion, partially based on posited cyber disruptions. This delay had a serious impact on Taiwan’s ability to contain Chinese forces on their initial beachhead. However, while cyber operations were useful for gaining temporary advantage, they were not by themselves war-winning tools. This is consistent with recent experience in the Ukraine war but not with the more imaginative effects proposed by some advocates and futurists. An important caution is that the game did not explore either of these domains with classified information. These are two domains where classified information might have an impact. A broader and more nuanced set of capabilities in both domains might produce different results, at least at the strategic or national level if not at the operational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter lays out recommendations arising from analysis of the results and the picture of the war developed above. The purpose is to help policymakers as they consider how the United States should respond to China’s increasing ability to invade Taiwan. Whether the decision is made to defend Taiwan or not, following these recommendations would provide flexibility to decisionmakers. Although these recommendations do not address every aspect of U.S.-China competition (which involves many other factors), these recommendations are worth pursuing because invasion is the most dangerous scenario. Further, many of the recommendations would apply to other scenarios, for example, a blockade of Taiwan or a conflict in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These recommendations are organized in three categories: (1) politics and strategy, (2) doctrine and posture, and (3) weapons and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;politics-and-strategy-1&quot;&gt;Politics and Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the game revolves around military operations, several political and strategic insights emerged with clear policy implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Prioritize deepening diplomatic and military ties with Japan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to operate from U.S. bases in Japan is so critical to U.S. success that it should be considered a sine qua non for intervention. Without Japanese basing, U.S. fighter/attack aircraft had to come from Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, which was then generally crippled by Chinese missile strikes. This enables China to mass its airpower forward and concentrate on support of ground forces on Taiwan. Furthermore, the non-participation of the JSDF improves the balance of forces in China’s favor. The United States in Japan has had close security ties for 70 years. These linkages need to be maintained and enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several game participants who had experience with the Japanese military recommended closer operational coordination between the U.S. and Japanese military establishments. Although the two militaries conduct many peacetime exercises together, the current interpretation of Japan’s constitution prohibits the establishment of a combined (or joint) command with the United States. Moreover, the lack of a standing joint command within the JSDF and the existence of inconsistent geographic command boundaries among the different Japanese services inhibit effective alliance coordination at the operational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In researching U.S.-Japanese wartime coordination, it became apparent that there may be a disconnect in the interpretation of bilateral treaties. The Status of Forces Agreement between the United States and Japan refers to a requirement for “consultation” between Japan and the United States, but both it and the original defensive alliance are vague about what this requires. Many Japanese officials interpret this as requiring the United States to obtain permission before flying combat missions from Japanese soil for any purpose other than the defense of Japan. However, U.S. officials tended to view “consultation” as notifying Japan of U.S. intentions. This disconnect must be remedied immediately, lest it leads to delays or disruption of war plans during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Clarify war plan assumptions.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military planning appears to assume that U.S. forces will be able to deploy onto the sovereign territory of other countries during a crisis. In particular, the Army and Marine Corps seem to assume that the MLRs and Army MDTFs will be pre-positioned in the Philippines, Taiwan, or on forward Japanese islands before conflict begins. This is militarily desirable because it allows the units to get close enough to Chinese naval forces to engage with anti-ship missiles. China’s ability to interdict U.S. force movement after D-Day makes prewar deployments critical to the functioning of many U.S. capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor would a simple one-time crisis deployment be sufficient. Any U.S. forces on the island would need to have all their logistical sustainment in place before conflict begins because it is so hard to get shipments through once China establishes its defensive zone over the island. This sustainment would need to include hundreds of missiles. A single strike by a squadron of 12 bombers launches over 200 missiles. To be a significant factor in a conflict, forward-deployed ground forces would need to provide comparable levels of missile strikes repeatedly over the course of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, such permissions for forward deployments en masse do not seem likely. As noted in the chapter on assumptions, most countries in the region (with the exceptions of Australia and Japan) are cool to the idea of becoming involved in a U.S.-China war due to the immense destruction it would cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Taiwan would welcome forward deployments, they would be politically fraught. The base case of this project did not allow such deployments because of current U.S. Taiwan policy, which follows from agreements made with China under the Three Communiqués and has historically prohibited the presence of uniformed U.S. military personnel on Taiwan. As noted in Chapter 4, stationing forces on Taiwan either in peacetime or during a crisis would elicit a strong, possibly even violent reaction from China. Many experts argue that such moves would trigger the conflict it was intended to deter. In 2020, Taiwanese authorities revealed the presence of elements of a rotational training detachment from the Marine Raider Regiment on Taiwan, but the stationing of combat elements would constitute a significant change to established U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is therefore the potential for a fundamental disconnect between U.S. war plans and political realities. The Army and Marine Corps could assume they can move forward in a crisis to threaten the Chinese fleet, while the State Department might oppose the moves as provocative, and the White House prohibits deployment. The U.S. government needs to reach a clear internal consensus before a crisis occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore imperative to clarify assumptions about war plans during peacetime and not as the crisis unfolds. The National Security Council would be the natural place to work the issue out because it can integrate perspectives from across the government. Senior civilian decisionmakers do not want to be in the position of Bethmann Hollweg, German chancellor who had to justify Germany violating Belgian neutrality in 1914 because that is what the war plans (over which he had no control) called for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is therefore the potential for a fundamental disconnect between U.S. war plans and political realities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if stationing ground forces on Taiwan is not politically practical, it is important to improve inter-military coordination. This might include creating liaison groups to develop joint procedures, practicing procedures in joint tabletop exercises, expanding Taiwanese participation in U.S. military PME programs, and forming cross-national planning groups to develop concepts for joint defensive operations. All these peacetime activities would smooth wartime operations. Such activities are particularly urgent in the case of Taiwan if the United States believes that conflict is possible in the near or medium term. The United States might also consider pre-positioning equipment and munitions on Taiwan without stationing troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United States cannot take too long deciding what to do in a crisis. The longer the United States delays entering the war, the more difficult the fight. Although the United States has enough advantages that it can still prevail in most scenarios, delay means more Chinese forces ashore on Taiwan, higher casualties, and more infrastructure destruction for all parties. Hence, it not only makes the U.S. task more difficult, it may also make off-ramps more difficult to find at the end of conflict. War plans for a Taiwan contingency will have to envision a quick U.S. response; civilian leaders must recognize this need for speed when the time for decision comes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Furthermore, the United States cannot take too long deciding what to do in a crisis. The longer the United States delays entering the war, the more difficult the fight.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recognize the need to continue operations in the face of heavy casualties.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civilian decisionmakers must recognize that the decision to defend Taiwan during an invasion would result in heavy casualties. If civilian leaders decided to begin the defense, then change their mind after initial casualties, it would incur the worst consequences of intervention and non-intervention: the United States would effectively be at war with China without the benefit of having maintained Taiwan’s autonomy. Again, this project does not argue whether these costs are worth the benefits, but that such an evaluation must be made with open eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conflict with China would be fundamentally unlike the regional conflicts and counterinsurgencies that the United States has experienced since World War II, with casualties exceeding anything in recent memory. Further, the casualty calculations shown in this report, as high as they are, do not encompass the full scope of the war. They cover only the first three or four weeks of the conflict and exclude casualties arising from the battles in the South China Sea, which the wargame abstracted. Thus, numbers presented here represent a floor, not a ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the game mechanics did not track personnel losses directly, these could be estimated from equipment losses (e.g., ships and aircraft). The level of personnel losses is fortunately relatively low relative to the losses in equipment. Nevertheless, personnel casualties averaged 6,960, of which about 3,200 would be killed in action, in the base case even without adding losses from combat in the South China Sea, which the project did not model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/52Vnd4r.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 11: Total U.S. Personnel Casualties, Killed, and Total (killed, wounded, or missing).&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Calculations of losses excluded two iterations (#5 and #6) because they were so short. Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States sustained about three killed per day. At the height of the Vietnam War, in 1968, the United States lost 30 killed per day. The loss rate here, about 140 per day in the base case, approaches that of World War II, 300 killed per day. Deaths (vs. casualties, which includes wounded) in three weeks of combat around Taiwan (about 3,200) are about half the total from 20 years of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan (5,474).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to shocking the U.S. public, the scale of casualties and equipment loss would stagger a U.S. military that has dominated battlefields for a generation. These losses would be particularly difficult for the Air Force and Navy, which have essentially operated in sanctuary since the end of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give an Air Force illustration, late-deploying units to Kadena Air Force Base on Okinawa will land at a base that has entire squadrons of wrecked U.S. and Japanese aircraft bulldozed to the side of the runway, hundreds of wounded in the base hospital, and temporary cemeteries to handle the many dead. Missile attacks and air combat will have wiped out squadrons that arrived only a few days earlier. Newly arriving personnel will be required to immediately conduct operations against the powerful Chinese forces that have caused so many casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Air Force understands this at an abstract level. The Air Force chief of staff, General Charles Brown, noted this challenge explicitly in his initial guidance: “Tomorrow’s Airmen are more likely to fight in highly contested environments and must be prepared to fight through combat attrition rates and risks to the Nation that are more akin to the World War II era than the uncontested environment to which we have since become accustomed.” However, the challenge will be incorporating this into training and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YQ5xTl2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image21&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 12: Depiction of Japanese Attack on Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, 1942.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: “Fogerty’s Fate” by LtCol A. Michael Leahy, USMCR available at the National Museum of the Marine Corps, Triangle, Virginia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Navy and Air Force will need to reject the notion that the next war will be long distance and “push-button,” not requiring personnel to face personal danger or operate under conditions of extreme hardship. Although such notions have been attractive since the end of World War II, they do not describe a twenty-first century conflict between great powers. The Air Force’s recent “multi-capable airmen” concept is a pragmatic acknowledgment of this grim reality. Under this concept, airmen will learn to do basic tasks outside their usual specialty, thus allowing easier adjustments to combat conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A broader question about leadership arises from the discussion about casualties and operational results: commanders will need to continue operations and move forward despite a high level of casualties not seen in living memory. It is easy to tell modern officers to emulate the tenacity in the face of adversity shown by their predecessors, such as Vice Admiral William Frederick “Bull” Halsey during the naval battles of the Solomon Islands, Major General Alexander Vandegrift on Guadalcanal, Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle raiding Tokyo, or General George Patton at Kasserine Pass. However, the current generation of military officers has been trained on “force protection,” whereby the minimization of casualties is of paramount importance. That makes sense in a counterinsurgency operation where maintaining long-term political support is vital. It is counterproductive in a conventional conflict with clear geographic and political goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Commanders will need to continue operations and move forward despite a high level of casualties not seen in living memory.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All military services should incorporate the recognition of casualties into their training programs and emphasize that there will be no safe rear areas in a great power conflict. The combat forces already do this, but such expectations need to be expanded. For example, many Army support units such as air defense have not suffered significant casualties since 1945, but now they will be a prime target for Chinese missiles. Similarly, aviation organizations should be restructured to cope with wartime losses to aircraft, maintenance facilities, and support personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Do not plan on striking the mainland.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strikes on the Chinese mainland create grave risks of escalation. These risks are discussed in depth above in the justification for the “U.S. National Command Authority rules out strikes on Chinese mainland” excursion case. Even if the war plan developed in peacetime calls for mainland strikes, the National Command Authority might withhold permission in the actual event of war. It would therefore be wise to hedge planning on the question of striking the Chinese mainland. If permissions are granted, then military leaders should be ready with plans for strikes on high-value targets such as over-the-horizon radar, satellite uplink stations, and high-value aircraft that affect the fight on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Strengthen Taiwanese ground forces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will not be able to insert ground forces onto Taiwan in a timely manner. In some iterations, the U.S. player attrited the PLAN sufficiently that some U.S. ground forces might get through after four or more weeks of conflict, though with some risk from remaining Chinese air and naval power. By that time, however, the battle for Taiwan will likely be decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once conflict begins, Taiwan’s isolation means that there can be no “Ukraine model.” In the Ukraine war, the United States and NATO have sent massive amounts of equipment and supplies directly to Ukraine during the conflict. Although Russia has made some efforts to interdict this flow by striking railroads with missiles, shutting down or even seriously impeding the flow has been beyond Russia’s military capability. However, China does have that capability. Therefore, all the equipment and munitions must arrive before China begins combat operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Once conflict begins, Taiwan’s isolation means that there can be no “Ukraine model.” . . . Therefore, all the equipment and munitions must arrive before China begins combat operations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should therefore encourage Taiwan to acquire sufficient munitions and weapons to fight the local battle against invading forces without any direct assistance for a prolonged period. For many munitions, Taiwan may be capable of producing its own stockpiles. For U.S.-supplied systems, foreign military sales provide a mechanism to get weapons to Taiwan before conflict begins. Taiwan has ordered billions of dollars of weapons, but deliveries have been slow. The United States should speed up the Foreign Military Sales process on its side and urge the Taiwanese to speed up on their side. There needs to be a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Taiwanese ground forces must immediately shift toward becoming more effective and survivable. Because defeating Chinese forces before they land is likely impossible, effective resistance ashore is critical. This requires an army that is ready, well-trained, well-led, and highly motivated. Without such a ground force, the rest will be in vain. Yet, it is not clear that the Taiwanese army has the necessary qualities. Taiwan needs to give its army a higher priority than it has received in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The island of Taiwan contains many geographic features such as mountains and rivers that the Taiwanese forces should use to their advantage. This includes cities and urban sprawl. Although the defense of cities would result in severe damage, failing to defend them makes Chinese operations on the island much easier. The longer Taiwan can lengthen the war, the greater the attrition of the Chinese fleet and the possibility of external aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Move Taiwanese air and naval forces toward asymmetry.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Taiwan has built a military with broad capabilities, paralleling those of major powers such as the United States. Thus, it has sought large surface ships and advanced aircraft in addition to submarines and ground forces. Currently, it has an air force with 534 combat aircraft (474 fighter/attack, 60 support) and a navy with 38 major vessels (4 submarines, 26 surface combatants, and 8 amphibious ships). Such a structure made sense when Chinese air and naval forces were relatively weak. Taiwan’s ability to contest China in the air and at sea meant it could defeat an invasion before ground forces landed in strength. That minimized damage to Taiwanese infrastructure and its economy. Further, such a structure provided visible reminders of Taiwan’s power and status in peacetime and could counter peacetime Chinese efforts to test Taiwanese sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a broad set of symmetrical capabilities today is inappropriate given the increasing strength of Chinese rocket, air, and naval forces. The Taiwanese surface navy would be quickly destroyed without inflicting significant damage on the Chinese fleet. Submarines are more survivable than surface ships but still vulnerable if China achieves surprise. Having a continuous at-sea submarine presence would mitigate this problem; however, such a presence is currently infeasible due to lack of numbers. The Taiwanese air force is similarly vulnerable. Chinese short-range ballistic missiles can cover all of Taiwan’s military tarmac and HASs, destroying all Taiwanese aircraft not in underground shelters. The surviving aircraft would contribute only marginally to the air battle over the island before being destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of the “porcupine strategy” was demonstrated by the project’s modeling and wargames. Because Taiwan cannot match China ship-for-ship or aircraft-for-aircraft, the “porcupine strategy” proposes that Taiwan invest more heavily in “agile and concealable weapons such as the portable Javelin and Stinger missiles” rather than expensive and vulnerable conventional weapons. The project’s findings are consistent with many other studies of Taiwan and reflect the current debate within Taiwan. These asymmetric capabilities (e.g., coastal defense cruise missiles, mobile SAMs, and mines) could also play a role in counter-blockade strategies if China pursued such a strategy with strikes on Taiwan itself. The Taiwanese navy’s budget would better contribute with coastal defense cruise missiles, missile boats, and mining rather than large surface combatants. Taiwanese ground-based ASCMs can survive a Chinese air and missile strike because of their mobility and were highly effective against Chinese surface ships. Mobile SAMs were more effective for air defense than fighters because of their greater survivability. They are also less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Because Taiwan cannot match China ship-for-ship or aircraft-for-aircraft, the “porcupine strategy” proposes that Taiwan invest more heavily in “agile and concealable weapons such as the portable Javelin and Stinger missiles” rather than expensive and vulnerable conventional weapons.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly important is the fulfillment of a current deal to supply Taiwan with ground-launched Harpoon missiles. In the game, the 400 missiles already programmed (but not yet delivered) had a large effect on weakening the initial Chinese invasion. Two hundred additional missiles would have as much impact on the naval battle as an MLR or MDTF but without the political risks of basing and the operational challenges of transportation and resupply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese progress toward such an asymmetric strategy has been halting. The United States has consistently urged the government of Taiwan to move away from boutique, vulnerable systems. Progress toward a “porcupine strategy” seemed to be made with a 2017 strategy by the then-chief of the Taiwanese military forces, Lee Hsi-Min. However, subsequent military chiefs have vacillated. Determining the correct combination of carrots and sticks to change Taiwanese attitudes is imperative for building an effective deterrent on today’s threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;doctrine-and-posture-1&quot;&gt;Doctrine and Posture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next are recommendations for how the U.S. military plans to operate (doctrine) and how it positions its forces in the theater (posture).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Fortify and expand air base capacity in Japan and Guam.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Japan lose hundreds of aircraft in every iteration, from an average of 290 in optimistic cases to 646 in pessimistic cases. For the U.S. Air Force, this represents 12 to 32 percent of its operational fighter/attack strength after three to four weeks of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture below shows U.S., Taiwanese, and Japanese losses (over 900) from one game iteration (#13), a pessimistic and intense encounter that ended in stalemate. The losses represent about 40 percent of the Air Force’s fighter/attack operational inventory. This would degrade U.S. power for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CEtysLe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image22&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 13: U.S., Taiwanese, and Japanese Losses from Game Iteration #13.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dilemma for aircraft is that they are vulnerable if based close to Taiwan but less useful if based farther away. The United States must aggressively attack the Chinese amphibious ships to prevent the Chinese from establishing a foothold in Taiwan. However, this means moving many aircraft forward before the Chinese missile threat diminishes. As bases closer to Taiwan can be struck by more Chinese missiles, moving U.S. aircraft closer to Taiwan increases aircrafts’ vulnerability to being destroyed on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andersen Air Force Base on Guam cannot substitute for bases in Japan. The distance from Guam to Taiwan (roughly 2,800 km) makes it impossi-ble to generate many sorties from Andersen Air Force Base. Despite the high casualties suffered by air-craft based in Japan, most U.S. players preferred Japanese basing to Guam. However, in those iterations where Japan was strictly neutral, Andersen Air Force Base became the principal U.S. base. This gave the Chinese powerful reasons to attack it repeatedly. Aircraft on Andersen Air Force Base are particularly vulnerable because, as of 2022, the base has no HASs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there is no viable substitute for using air bases in Japan, the United States needs to work with Tokyo to harden Japanese bases with shelters and expand their tarmacs for dispersing aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concrete (hardening) lacks influential constituencies within military bureaucracies, but the large benefit justifies a strong effort. Although HASs do not provide complete protection, they require China to expend more missiles to destroy each aircraft. If every aircraft were in a shelter, China would be unable to use missiles with submunitions that destroy several aircraft each. In conjunction with deception and active defenses, the United States could shift the cost-exchange ratio of Chinese attacks on U.S. aircraft in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PS2JoOL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 14: U.S. Bases in the Western Pacific.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While active defenses are helpful, they cannot be thought of as the primary means of mitigating Chinese missile attacks. On the one hand, local commanders want active defenses because they offer a tangible counter against adversary aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. Investing in passive defenses such as hardening and dispersion that simply mitigate the effects of enemy attacks represents a tacit acceptance of losses. On the other hand, China’s inventory of missiles means that even if active defenses are highly effective (as assumed in the project’s modeling), then the sheer volume of fire will overwhelm U.S. active defenses. Active defense therefore must be used with a robust system of passive defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides hardening, the United States and Japan should also work to secure access to civilian international airports. The base case assumed that the Air Force used one civilian regional airfield per military airfield. This could be augmented with access to a broader set of civilian airfields, particularly large international ones. As Chinese missile attacks constitute an area attack problem, increasing the area those missiles must cover is an effective countermeasure. Although local political opposition may obstruct peacetime and possibly wartime access to Japanese civilian airports, the significant payoff justifies a strong effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Restructure U.S. Air Force doctrine and procurement to address vulnerability on the ground.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with large losses on the ground, U.S. players often dispersed aircraft to regional civilian airfields in Japan. By spreading aircraft out and thus diluting the effect of any single Chinese missile attack, dispersion effectively reduced losses. Dispersion is a major element in contemporary discussions about operational concepts in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, unprepared civilian airfields have drawbacks; there will always be a need for well-equipped military airfields. First, there is a logistical cost for dispersing and time lost in making the move top civilian airfields. Second, the United States needs basing for hundreds of aircraft, which is far beyond what regional airfields can handle. Third, as activities on a dispersion airfield expand, the airfield becomes functionally like a main operating base but without the hardened infrastructure, specialized logistics, and air defenses. Large, well-equipped — and fully hardened — bases remain indispensable for sortie generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Force doctrine is beginning to address this trade-off between preparation and dispersion through the agile combat employment (ACE) concept. ACE allows operations from a network of smaller, dispersed locations through a hub-and-spokes model that can complicate adversary planning while maintaining high sortie generation. These dispersed locations would be “defensible, sustainable, and relocatable.” This doctrinal adjustment will reduce the drawbacks of using civilian airfields. The Air Force is practicing the skills needed for ACE in a variety of exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these efforts do not go far enough. Rather than attempting to tack dispersion onto a predetermined force structure and doctrine, the Air Force needs to engineer survivability into its structure from the ground up. Sweden’s Flygbassystem 60/90 provides an example of hardening and dispersion to protect forces on the ground. Having observed the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground during World War II and the increasing power of nuclear weapons, the Swedish air force adopted Flygbassystem 60, a system of concrete command bunkers, mobile maintenance teams, and multiple dispersed runways designed to improve aircraft survivability in a potential war against the Soviet Union. This system was updated to Flygbassystem 90 after witnessing the effectiveness of air base attacks and runway cratering munitions in the Arab-Israeli wars. ACE is a sound first step, but it must be expanded into a more holistic doctrine such as with the Flygbassystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Do not plan on overflying the Chinese mainland.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every iteration, the Air Force was never able to begin operations within Chinese airspace by the end of game play (typically after three to four weeks of conflict). Instead, U.S. Air Force had to focus on the ground, air, and sea battles on and immediately around Taiwan and had little leeway to employ airpower over the mainland. Attrition was high enough without contending with China’s integrated air defense system (IADS) on the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strikes against military and civilian infrastructure on the mainland were counterproductive distractions. They require a massive and sustained air campaign that takes a long time to have operational effects and diverted attention from immediate battlefield needs. Bombers equipped with standoff munitions were effective against the mainland but employed solely against ports and airfields because these targets directly affected the situation on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players were reluctant to risk B-2 bombers, the only long-range assets possibly capable of penetrating Chinese airspace, because of their limited numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor will this problem become better in the 2030s. When the B-21 bomber becomes widely available and the B-2 is retired in the 2030s, China’s IADS will have also progressed. Nevertheless, the B-21 program remains important, as it might be the only bomber capable of launching medium-range munitions (e.g., the JSOW) and surviving in the expanding Chinese air defense bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Air Force must therefore avoid force structure and doctrinal decisions that are geared toward overflying China’s robust IADS on the mainland. This does not mean that stealth is unimportant: it is still necessary to destroy targets away from the coast that are protected by long-range air defenses. However, any program that envisions overflight of the Chinese mainland is unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The U.S. Air Force must therefore avoid force structure and doctrinal decisions that are geared toward overflying China’s robust IADS on the mainland.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recognize the limitations of Marine Littoral Regiments and Army Multi-Domain Task Forces and cap their numbers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Marine Corps is building Marine Littoral Regiments (MLRs) to operate inside the Chinese defensive zone (which the Marine Corps calls the “weapons engagement zone”) and contest Chinese air and naval assets. The Army envisions its Multi-Domain Task Forces (MDTFs) as having a similar function. Although these units could contribute to the fight, neither played heavily in most scenarios. The problems of operating inside the Chinese defensive zone were insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game assumed that by 2026, the Marine Corps had an MLR on Okinawa and another on Hawaii. The MLR on Okinawa was able to exert local influence, destroying two Chinese ships in one iteration (#19). However, its Naval Strike Missiles (NSMs) have a range of only 100 nautical miles, and Chinese fleets rarely came that close Okinawa, being focused on the waters around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Although these units [MLRs and MDTFs] could contribute to the fight, neither played heavily in most scenarios. The problems of operating inside the Chinese defensive zone were insurmountable.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In several games, the U.S. player tried to move an MLR onto Taiwan by air or sea, but in all cases the unit and transportation assets were destroyed while trying to transit the extensive Chinese defensive zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most scenarios, political assumptions prevented any U.S. forces from being pre-positioned on Taiwanese or Philippine territory before the conflict begins. (See Chapter 4 for a description of the base case assumptions and above for a recommendation on verifying war plan assumptions.) However, one scenario assumed that that the United States was willing to risk provocation by putting U.S. forces onto Taiwan, whether because Chinese mobilization generated sufficient concern, or the U.S.-China relationship had changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, before hostilities began, an MLR deployed from Okinawa with its load of missiles and one reload, augmenting the shore-based fires of Taiwanese Harpoons. The NSM’s 100-nautical-mile range could easily enable attacks on Chinese amphibious ships from Taiwan. Assuming that the MLR deployed with a load of 72 NSMs on 18 launchers, modeling showed that the MLRs would sink an average of five major Chinese amphibious ships. Because of the MLR’s ability to conduct distributed operations, it was assumed to be survivable in the face of Chinese counteraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, resupply proved impossible. A resupply mission of C-17s escorted by fighters attempted to break through the Chinese CAP but was shot down. After that, no further attempts were made at resupply. The MLR became a ground infantry battalion, augmenting the 114 combat battalions of the Taiwanese ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground units will not provide a significant volume of fire. A squadron of bombers armed with long-range cruise missiles has a greater volume of fire than an entire MLR but without the challenges of transportation and logistics. Ground-based anti-ship units must either deploy with a large number of missiles before the conflict begins or act as forward sensors for long-range air and naval power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar stories emerged from MLR deployments to the western Ryukyus and Philippines. In one scenario, the MLR was prepositioned in the western Ryukyus. In that location, it could attack Chinese naval forces that moved north of Taiwan, but resupply was deemed too risky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another scenario, an MLR moved onto the Philippine islands north of Luzon. There, it could attack Chinese forces that moved south of Taiwan, but again resupply was impossible, limiting its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All game iterations had an MLR and Army MDTF on Hawaii available for deployment by airlift, but no U.S. player called them forward. Instead, the U.S. player gave priority to Patriot battalions, which could add to the air defense of threatened airfields. These were needed because of repeated Chinese air and missile attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the project team recommends continuing to develop land-based forces to counter Chinese air and naval capabilities but also the need to recognize their employment challenges. While these new formations were more useful than traditional ground forces, multiplying these specialized units has limited value because only the first few can be deployed successfully. Others will sit unused. The maximum number is probably two or three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of long-range ground-launched missiles might overcome this limitation. If ground-launched Tomahawks have a similar range to their Vertical Launch System (VLS) counterparts, they could be employed from peacetime bases on Okinawa without moving in the Chinese defensive zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Avoid crisis deployments that create vulnerabilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. warfighting doctrine includes a pre-hostility phase designed to strengthen deterrence and enhance U.S. warfighting capabilities should conflict occur. As a result, the United States routinely makes forward deployments in crises. Therefore, in a major confrontation with China, the United States might load up Japan and Guam with aircraft and move CSGs into the region to signal U.S. resolve. Unfortunately, as Thomas Schelling, the great strategist, observed, “A fine deterrent can make a superb target.” In early 1941, the United States transferred the home base of the Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to deter Japanese aggression and station the fleet closer to the potential fight. However, this move put the fleet within range of Japanese striking forces, with results as tragic as they are well known. Similarly, U.S. deployments during a confrontation with China might tempt China to attack preemptively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Thomas Schelling, the great strategist, observed, “A fine deterrent can make a superb target.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, the United States might be able to keep air and naval forces forward for deterrence but pull them back or disperse them to less vulnerable sites when deterrence was on the verge of failing. However, this cannot be relied on in practice. First, partners and allies will push hard to keep forces forward as long as possible. They would regard withdrawal as a sign of abandonment, not prudence. Further, it requires precise knowledge about when China intends to strike; however, China decides D-Day. The United States had such knowledge before the war in Ukraine, but warning may not always be as clear. Furthermore, China could plan on one D-Day, then reset it if the U.S. withdraws forward-deployed forces. Finally, it would take several days for all the vulnerable forces to get out of range, so withdrawal must begin with enough lead time before hostilities start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs to develop mechanisms to enhance deterrence that do not also create a tempting target. As commentators have noted, the withdrawal of U.S. squadrons from Kadena probably enhances deterrence by reducing the temptation to strike a vulnerable target. Deploying defensive systems within the Chinese defensive zone would increase capabilities without increasing vulnerability. Deploying offensive systems to locations outside Chinese missile ranges, such as sending bombers to Hawaii or Australia, would indicate resolve without increasing vulnerability. Assuming enough warning to withdraw vulnerable assets prior to conflict breaking out is highly risky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;weapons-and-platforms-1&quot;&gt;Weapons and Platforms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, analysis of the game results generated recommendations about the procurement of specific weapons and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shift to smaller, more survivable ships.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with aircraft, the United States lost many surface ships in almost every iteration because of forward deployment within the Chinese defensive zone. U.S. losses of large surface ships typically totaled two carriers and 15 to 25 cruisers/destroyers. Although this represented only about 15 to 25 percent of total U.S. Navy surface combatants, losses typically included nearly all large surface ships in the Western Pacific. In the most intense iterations, the U.S. Navy was losing a major ship every day of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the Chinese ground-launched missile inventory was exhausted, it was too dangerous for U.S. or Japanese surface ships to approach Taiwan. Amphibious ships were particularly vulnerable because of their lack of defensive systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some iterations, surface ships could approach Taiwan in week three or four when the Chinese anti-ship missile inventory had declined. Even then, the ALCMs of the PLAAF and PLANAF, the torpedoes and cruise missiles of PLAN submarines, and the ship-based anti-ship missiles of the PLAN meant that the survivability of U.S. surface ships was low. U.S. ships were rarely able to get within Harpoon or SM-6 range of Chinese ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Until the Chinese ground-launched missile inventory was exhausted, it was too dangerous for U.S. or Japanese surface ships to approach Taiwan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after Chinese ASBMs (Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles) had been expended, the utility of U.S. surface ships had limits. Although the range of the Maritime Strike Tomahawk (MST) allowed U.S. surface ships to attack Chinese ships from a distance, every MST in a ship’s inventory meant one fewer interceptor or anti-submarine missile that the ship had for defense. A ship with enough MSTs to destroy multiple Chinese warships was a glass cannon, very vulnerable in turn to Chinese attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as there will be too many incoming missiles for active defense to adequately protect airfields, there will be too many anti-ship missiles for active defense to adequately protect surface ships. Therefore, active defense with interceptors must be paired with soft kill measures (e.g., reduced radar cross-section and electronic warfare) that complicate enemy targeting. To this end, the budget of the Surface Warfare Division of the Operational Test and Evaluation Force, which tests ship defenses, should be increased. Even with improved electronic warfare, many ships will be lost in a conflict with China because electronic warfare advantages are transitory. Procurement decisions must therefore consider the vulnerability of surface ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all points to benefits in shifting toward a fleet of smaller, stealthier ships integrated with unmanned decoys. Such ships would be better disposed to the soft kill of incoming missiles. In addition, it will not be as devastating to lose smaller, cheaper, less-capable ships. The Navy should also have expendable or unmanned ships accompany CSGs to act as decoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Develop rescue mechanisms to deal with crippled ships and multiple sinkings.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because a ship is sunk does not mean that its problems are over. Hundreds or even thousands of U.S. sailors would be thrown into the water each time a ship sinks. Currently, the U.S. Navy has no way of rescuing these sailors except by diverting a warship, with all the associated risks and opportunity costs. Game participants with a naval background recalled the experience of the USS Juneau in World War II. The ship was torpedoed and sunk on November 13, 1942, leaving 100 sailors in the water. However, the local commander judged it too risky to stop and look for survivors. Only 10 survivors were left when finally picked up eight days later. World War II convoys routinely included a rescue ship to pick up survivors so that warships did not have to be diverted. In addition to their humanitarian function, rescuing 4,200 shipwrecked crew during the war, rescue ships boosted morale by reassuring sailors about their chances of survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9yVUCZ8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 15: Japanese Shin-Maywa US-2.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, many mission kills would not result in the ship being sunk but rather incapacitated. Without appropriate assets to tow disabled ships to port, they would have to be scuttled, depriving the Navy of an irreplaceable asset. For example, in World War II, all five U.S. fleet carriers lost in action were scuttled to keep them from falling into enemy hands after receiving severe damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Navy needs to develop rescue ships that can accompany CSGs and SAGs. Such ships could both rescue shipwrecked sailors and tow disabled ships. Some version of the existing oceangoing tugs (Navy classification: “ATS”) might be suitable. Although this is a lower-priority requirement in peacetime, the wartime need is clear. The nation would be unforgiving if the Navy left sailors to drown because it was too risky to save them. Unlike in 1943, ubiquitous social media would prevent suppression of information about the event. Further, the tugs might save some damaged ships that would otherwise be lost. The Navy will need every ship it has because of the long time required for new construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-navy-needs-to-develop-rescue-ships-that-can-accompany-csgs-and-sags-such-ships-could-both-rescue-shipwrecked-sailors-and-tow-disabled-ships&quot;&gt;The U.S. Navy needs to develop rescue ships that can accompany CSGs and SAGs. Such ships could both rescue shipwrecked sailors and tow disabled ships.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Navy might also consider acquiring an amphibious patrol aircraft that could help rescue sailors from sunken ships and aircrew from downed aircraft. In a situation where the United States and Japan lose dozens of aircrew a week, each of whom requires millions of dollars and many years to train, such rescues make military sense aside from the humanitarian imperative. The picture shows the Japanese Shin-Maywa US-2, an amphibious aircraft designed for maritime rescue missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Prioritize submarines and other undersea platforms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every iteration, the U.S. player moved submarines into the Taiwan Strait, where they could attack Chinese amphibious ships directly. Indeed, in the base case, one U.S. submarine squadron begins in the strait because that likely constitutes current deployment practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the straits, U.S. submarines wreaked havoc on Chinese shipping. Based on the agent-based modeling found in RAND’s U.S.-China Military Scorecard and historical evidence from World War II, each submarine would sink two large amphibious vessels (and an equal number of decoys and escorts) over the course of a 3.5-day turn. Every submarine squadron (four submarines) in the strait sank eight Chinese amphibious ships and eight escorts or decoys, but at a price of roughly 20 percent attrition per 3.5 days. U.S. submarines operated on a “conveyor belt,” whereby they hunted, moved back to port (Guam, Yokosuka, or Wake Island), reloaded, then moved forward again and hunted. Doing this cycle as quickly as possible was important because the number of submarine squadrons was limited during the early phases of the conflict and their contribution was so significant. Submarines were also needed to screen against Chinese submarines exiting the first island chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;U.S. submarines wreaked havoc on Chinese shipping.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the value of submarines, acquiring more is an obvious recommendation. Most analyses of future naval force structure agree that the United States should build more attack submarines than are currently programmed. However, it is unlikely that the United States could build more than the current rate of two a year during the 2020s and early 2030s when it is also building the Columbia-class SSBN. Indeed, even achieving two per year may be a stretch. However, the U.S. Navy should commit to funding those two per year even if shipbuilding funds get tight. The Navy should also consider keeping submarines in service longer, as it has proposed by extending the service life of some 688-class boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Navy should also ensure that it has reloading facilities in Yokosuka, Guam, and Wake Island. Forcing submarines to go back to Pearl Harbor to reload wastes valuable hunting time. Because China will likely target fixed facilities, mobile reloading from civilian ports should be practiced. The Navy also needs to ensure that it has enough torpedoes. Although the game did not model this munition, there is reason for concern. The historical record is that many torpedoes will miss or malfunction, some will be lost when the submarine carrying them is sunk, and others will be destroyed when shore facilities are attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, investment in unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) should be prioritized. There is guaranteed to be some submarine attrition in a fight against China, particularly in the constrained waters of the Taiwan Strait. Each loss would be a painful blow. A Virginia-class submarine has a crew of 135 and costs roughly $3 billion. While UUVs are not as capable as attack submarines, they could be programmed to fulfill some relatively straightforward missions (e.g., minelaying).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Procure sufficient stockpiles of standoff anti-ship weapons.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Munitions usage was high. In the three to four weeks of conflict, U.S. forces usually expended about 5,000 long-range precision missiles, primarily JASSMs and LRASMs. The United States expended its global LRASM inventory within the first few days in all scenarios. JASSM inventories were large enough that they did not run low until the third or fourth week of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In games where the JASSM-ER has maritime strike capabilities, the abundance of U.S. munitions made U.S. strategy an almost uncomplicated exercise. With each squadron of 12 bombers carrying around 200 stealthy, standoff ASCMs, the United States could rapidly cripple the Chinese fleet and leave the invasion force stranded. For this reason, many studies that look at this problem recommend expanding the arsenal of anti-ship weapons. However, as discussed in the assumptions chapter, the JASSM-ER might not have this capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States expended its global LRASM inventory within the first few days in all scenarios.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JASSM-ERs were still somewhat useful in excursion scenarios where they could not strike ships at sea. In this case, JASSM-ERs could strike Chinese ports and airfields. However, these attacks against the homeland of a nuclear power raised questions about escalation. Attacks against ships at sea do not raise that concern to the same degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, without a deep magazine of standoff anti-ship weapons, the Air Force had to use shorter-range JSMs and JSOWs to attack Chinese ships once the LRASMs were gone. The limited range of JSMs and JSOWs meant that aircraft had to get within range of Chinese SAMs and CAP for strikes, which resulted in higher attrition and aborted missions. With a deeper magazine of LRASMs instead of JASSM-ERs, this problem would not have arisen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missile inventories reflect service priorities. The Air Force prefers to strike land targets as part of an air superiority campaign, while naval targets have lower priority. Thus, in 2026, the available Air Force inventory of JASSM (all variants) will number about 6,500, while its LRASM inventory will be only about 100. Although the Navy has more LRASMs, it does not have the ability to launch them en masse in the way that only Air Force bombers can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Air Force needs to embrace and implement the anti-ship mission. The need to attack Chinese amphibious forces makes this mission critical. Maritime strike has a long history with the Air Force, dating from its earliest days, with the sinking of the Ostfreisland in 1921 and the interception of the Rex in 1938. General George C. Kenney’s World War II operations in the Southwest Pacific also constitute a pertinent precedent, as his 5th Air Force supported ground and naval operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to implement such an effort would be to shift JASSM production to the LRASM. The missiles are built on the same production line and are 70 percent common. The LRASM can strike the greatest threat, the Chinese amphibious fleet, with less risk of escalation. Yet the JASSM inventory is far larger than that of LRASMs, and production plans in FY 2023 continue that imbalance, consisting of 581 JASSMs and 88 LRASMs. This is backward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powered naval mines are another option that might be highly effective. Mines have the advantage of obviating the requirement for precise targeting of the Chinese fleet; once the Chinese select an invasion beach, any mine dropped there will eventually hit a ship. While current extended-range mines require aircraft to get within 40 km of the target, a powered version of these mines could reach farther and reduce attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accelerating CLEAVER, a program to put palletized missiles into the cargo bay of a C-17 or C-130 cargo aircraft, would expand the number of launch platforms. This may sound unnecessary, as the United States has bombers that are specifically designed to deliver such payloads. However, there are not enough bombers to sustain attrition and launch all the strikes that are needed. Being able to include some of the 225 C-17s in these long-range strikes would add flexibility to mission planning and hedge against unexpectedly high losses to the bomber force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the project tracked a few key munitions and assumed that the United States had sufficient stockpiles of the rest. This may not be true. The DOD should review the inventories of all relevant munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Continue development and fielding of hypersonic weapons but recognize that they are a niche capability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypersonic weapons, defined as missiles able to travel more than five times the speed of sound, have received considerable attention in recent years. Their high speed makes defense difficult and allows them to strike fleeting targets. The base case includes Chinese DF-17s with hypersonic maneuverable re-entry vehicles. It is logical for China to pursue hypersonic technologies to defeat the well-developed U.S. missile defense system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2026, the United States will have few equivalent hypersonic systems. The game included 50 U.S. hypersonic weapons (the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW), although this was speculative. In 2022, no U.S. hypersonic weapons are yet programs of record although several systems are emerging from development. Most U.S. hypersonic programs would likely be in testing or initial fielding in 2026 and thus not available in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypersonic weapons would be useful for attacking highly defended and deep targets such as China’s over-the-horizon-backscatter radars or satellite uplink stations. Modeling indicated that Chinese defenses could typical shoot down about 25 percent of U.S. land-attack cruise missiles targeting the mainland. This blunted the effect of U.S. attacks. Hypersonic weapons would not suffer this attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, hypersonic weapons are expensive and no substitute for large numbers of long-range cruise missiles. Picking off a few high-value targets does not solve the central problem of countering a massed invasion. That requires sinking enough amphibious ships such that Chinese forces cannot sustain a lodgment on Taiwan. The strategist Hal Brands made this point in an assessment of contemporary arms races, “The United States doesn’t need to emulate every Chinese breakthrough in hypersonic weapons. These weapons can’t provide, at a reasonable cost, the volume of fire power Washington would need in the Western Pacific.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Prioritize sustainment of the bomber fleet over fighters.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both bombers and fighter/attack aircraft played important roles. However, the range and high ordnance throughput of bombers presented the Chinese with a particularly daunting challenge. The range of bombers meant that they could be based beyond the range of Chinese ballistic missiles, while their ordnance throughput meant that they could rapidly attrite Chinese forces. When paired with standoff munitions, even unstealthy “bomb trucks” are extremely useful against targets at the edge of the Chinese air defense zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The range and high ordnance throughput of bombers presented the Chinese with a particularly daunting challenge. The range of bombers meant that they could be based beyond the range of Chinese ballistic missiles, while their ordnance throughput meant that they could rapidly attrite Chinese forces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This combination of platforms with long-range precision munitions is viable because this air campaign focuses on a few hundred aiming points comprising ships, air bases, and ports and airfields. It is not a strategic bombing campaign involving tens of thousands of aim points on the Chinese mainland and designed to paralyze the economy, military command structure, and political operations. Long-range precision missiles are too expensive to be procured in the numbers necessary to prosecute such a campaign, as the Russians are finding out in Ukraine. Further, as noted earlier, such a campaign raises questions about escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of bombers leads to several recommendations for Air Force acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stop retiring bombers. The Air Force has been retiring legacy bombers in expectation of fielding the B-21 and as part of its “divest to invest” strategy. This creates a gap in capability because the B-21s will not be available in large numbers until the 2030s. If the United States believes there is a significant chance of conflict with China in the 2020s, then the size of the bomber force should be maintained. Thus, the Air Force might retain its B-1 and B-52 fleets even as the B-21 enters the inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Re-engine the B-52 fleet. The program, called the Commercial Engine Replacement Program, is already in Air Force plans. The Air Force will need as many bombers as it can get even when the B-21 has been fielded.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure that all bombers can carry the full range of munitions. For example, the LRASM is currently certified only for the B-1 bomber and the F/A-18E/F. Given the LRASM’s centrality in destroying Chinese surface forces, it needs to be employable from all aircraft for maximum flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the implications for aircraft type and mix if most are lost on the ground. Fifth-generation aircraft were just as vulnerable on the ground as 4.5-generation aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think ahead to the next stage of bomber vulnerability. China likely also appreciates the significance of the threat that the U.S. bomber force poses. China might develop longer-range SAMs or deploy long-range air-to-air missiles on fighters that would fly deep into the Philippine Sea. The United States must develop countermeasures in the same way it thinks about disrupting the anti-ship-missile kill chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harden bomber bases in Australia, Hawaii, and Alaska. In this game (set in 2026), China had few options for striking these critical bases. Chinese submarines might theoretically operate that far from port but were generally fully engaged in the Western Pacific. However, future Chinese missiles might have the range to destroy aircraft based there. The DOD should examine the defenses of Alaska and Hawaii since they will increasingly be within the scope of Chinese strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Procure more, cheaper fighters.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many aircraft lost early in the conflict, the Air Force risks running out of aircraft and becoming irrelevant to the conflict unless it has a large enough force to sustain the losses. Therefore, the Air Force should be cautious about taking its “divest to invest” strategy too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers matter. Throughout the campaign, even fourth-generation fighter/attack aircraft had value. For many missions (such as launching standoff weapons), the stealth of fifth-generation aircraft is not needed. This was particularly true later in the conflict when Chinese air defenses weakened. At the same time, losing all fifth-generation aircraft early was a problem. After the long-range LRASMs were gone, fifth-generation aircraft were particularly valuable because they could press in to deliver shorter-range JSMs or JSOWs. There is therefore a strong argument for keeping a balanced mix throughout by withholding fifth-generation aircraft until the Chinese missile inventory is depleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ninety percent of aircraft losses occurred on the ground.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability of aircraft on the ground raises questions about U.S. plans to procure relatively small numbers of extremely capable but expensive aircraft. If most are lost on the ground before they can bring their advanced capabilities to bear, then cheaper airframes might be worthwhile. Plans to procure the Next Generation Air Dominance fighter, with a cost per airframe of “‘multiple’ hundreds of millions” of dollars, do not make sense if 90 percent of U.S. and Japanese aircraft losses occurred on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion--victory-is-not-everything&quot;&gt;Conclusion — Victory Is Not Everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game results showed that the United States and Taiwan could successfully defend the island even under relatively pessimistic assumptions. This is different from many observers’ impressions and constitutes an important insight. The analysis also indicates that there is no need for the United States to consider highly risky strategies such as preemptive attacks on Chinese amphibious shipping or the early use of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China would take enormous risks in launching such an operation. Chapter 5 describes the heavy losses to Chinese air and naval forces that even a successful invasion would entail. These losses would take many years to replace. Invasion forces on Taiwan would risk destruction if, as happened in many iterations, the Chinese were unable to sustain these forces in the face of heavy maritime losses. This failure would produce tens of thousands of prisoners of war, a highly visible and emotional symbol of defeat. Although the project did not explore what effects these losses might have on the Chinese political system, the CCP would be risking its hold on power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is no cause for complacency by the United States or Taiwan. First, China could choose other coercive paths, whether it be the seizure of offshore Taiwanese islands, a bombardment without ensuing invasion, or a blockade. These contingencies also warrant consideration. Second, the morale of Taiwan’s military and leadership must be strong enough to resist a Chinese attack in the face of high losses. Without the will to resist, the rest is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the human, economic, military, and political costs loom over even a successful defense. These would be enormous. The discussion below lays out a few of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan’s Economy Debilitated:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese forces, even if defeated, would inflict massive damage on Taiwanese infrastructure and cripple its economy for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Damage:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the game included cyber affects at the operational level, it did not examine economic and social impacts. Both Taiwan and the United States might suffer damage to civilian and economic infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost Military Capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States would suffer tremendous damage to its military forces. Rebuilding these capabilities would take many years and would occur at a slower rate than China’s rebuild, given the rapid pace of Chinese military modernization. With only two U.S. shipyards currently building large surface combatants, it would take decades to replace the dozen or more such ships lost while continuing the Navy’s build program. Lost carriers could not be replaced because the current shipyard capacity is sufficient only to maintain the current carrier force. Aircraft would be a bit easier to replace. For example, the United States lost an average of 200 to 500 aircraft across the scenarios. At current procurement rates of about 120 such aircraft per year, it would take two to four years to replace those aircraft, assuming no further attrition and no retirement of aging aircraft in the force. Ships and aircraft would take longer to replace if the war went beyond the three or four weeks of game play or if losses from engagements in the South China Sea were calculated and included.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of Global Position:&lt;/strong&gt; The world would not be standing still during and after a U.S.-China conflict. Other countries — for example, Russia, North Korea, or Iran — might take advantage of U.S. distraction to pursue their agendas. After the war, a weakened U.S. military might not be able to sustain the balance of power in Europe or the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk of Escalation:&lt;/strong&gt; Although this project focused on conventional conflict, many analyses of an invasion have nuclear play. The recent novel 2034 concludes with nuclear strikes. The CNAS wargame, Dangerous Straits, similarly ends with the use of nuclear weapons. No one knows what those escalation dynamics would be. They depend on an unprecedented event, conventional war between nuclear powers, as well as the opaque decisionmaking process of the CCP. The recommendations above to focus on anti-ship attacks instead of mainland strikes could reduce the risk of escalation, but that risk will never go away.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protracted or Episodic Conflict:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, the war might not end after this initial phase but drag on for months or even years. Conflict might be episodic, with periodic ceasefires. This project is called The First Battle of the Next War for a reason. Opening battles, even if seemingly decisive, generally do not end a conflict. Cathal Nolan makes this argument in his monumental study, The Allure of Battle. After looking at the long history of wars, he concludes, “How to win decisively in war is the aspiration of all professional military, and a main subject of concern to those who study war. Yet it is the single hardest thing to do, to translate combat into achievement of an important strategic and political goal that the other side is forced to recognize and accept when the war is over.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These losses might cause strategic disillusionment. The United States would sustain as many personnel casualties in a month of such conflict as in 20 years of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The scale and suddenness of such losses would shock a U.S. population unaccustomed to significant military losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect might be like the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, where the combination of surprise, betrayal, and loss solidified public opinion and created a determination to press the conflict to its conclusion. On the other hand, the effect might be like the 1983 bombing of the U.S. barracks in Beirut, where the U.S. population and political establishment decided that the cost was not worth the foreign policy benefit. The result was withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the United States prosecuted the war to a successful conclusion, a narrative of disillusionment might emerge. U.S. policymakers and Americans might question whether the sacrifice had been worth preserving Taiwanese independence and democracy. That kind of disillusionment occurred after World War I. Even though the United States was successful, with relatively low casualties (at least compared to the other combatants), there was profound disillusionment after the war. Many argued that “merchants of death” had manipulated the United States into the war. This produced a turn toward isolationism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Even if the United States prosecuted the war to a successful conclusion, a narrative of disillusionment might emerge.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project does not take a position on whether the United States should defend Taiwan. That requires a political and foreign policy assessment of benefits, costs, and values that goes beyond the scope of the current effort. The project does rigorously document the likely outcomes of defending Taiwan in a variety of scenarios and how different assumptions about conditions and capabilities affect those outcomes. The intention is that this analysis will help the public and policy discussion about how the United States should move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the project recognizes that a succession of Democratic and Republican administrations, a bipartisan consensus in Congress, and a near uniformity of views among strategists identify China as the “pacing” U.S. competitor. U.S. policy needs to be broadly aimed at succeeding in this competition. In the military sphere, it is imperative to deter China from starting any conflict. To be deterred, China must doubt their ability to prevail through force of arms. This requires U.S. military capability to be manifestly sufficient for the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing that capability will have additional costs but does not require across-the-board increases in U.S. defense spending. The recommendations in the previous chapter target specific capabilities that would be most useful for conflict in the Western Pacific. To offset these investments, less effective capabilities might be cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To be deterred, China must doubt their ability to prevail through force of arms. This requires U.S. military capability to be manifestly sufficient for the task.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line from the analysis is that a successful defense is possible, and deterrence is achievable, but it will require planning, some resources, and political will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark F. Cancian&lt;/strong&gt; (Colonel, USMCR, ret.) is a senior adviser with the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C. He joined CSIS in April 2015 from the Office of Management and Budget, where he spent more than seven years as chief of the Force Structure and Investment Division, working on issues such as Department of Defense budget strategy, war funding, and procurement programs, as well as nuclear weapons development and nonproliferation activities in the Department of Energy. Previously, he worked on force structure and acquisition issues in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and ran research and executive programs at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. In the military, Colonel Cancian spent over three decades in the U.S. Marine Corps, active and reserve, serving as an infantry, artillery, and civil affairs officer and on overseas tours in Vietnam, Desert Storm, and Iraq (twice). Since 2000, he has been an adjunct faculty member at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, where he teaches a course on the connection between policy and analysis. A prolific author, he has published over 40 articles on military operations, acquisition, budgets, and strategy and received numerous writing awards. He graduated with high honors (magna cum laude) from Harvard College and with highest honors (Baker scholar) from Harvard Business School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew Cancian&lt;/strong&gt; currently conducts classified wargaming at the U.S. Naval War College as a senior researcher for Saalex Solutions. He holds a PhD in political science from MIT, where he concentrated in security studies and comparative politics. His thesis was about the motivations of combatants and the effects of training, based on a survey of 2,301 Kurdish fighters (Peshmerga) during their war against the Islamic State. Before attending MIT, he earned an MA in law and diplomacy from the Fletcher School and a BA in history from the University of Virginia. Between those educational experiences, he served as a captain in the U.S. Marine Corps, deploying to Sangin, Afghanistan, as a forward observer in 2011 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric Heginbotham&lt;/strong&gt; is a principal research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for International Studies and a specialist in Asian security issues. Before joining MIT, he was a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, where he was the lead author of the RAND US-China Military Scorecard and a RAND study on China’s Evolving Nuclear Deterrent. He is the co-author (with George Gilboy) of Chinese and Indian Strategic Behavior: Growing Power and Alarm, published by Cambridge University Press in 2012, and is an editor of China Steps Out: Beijing’s Major Power Engagement with the Developing World (Routledge, 2018). Prior to that, he was a senior fellow of Asian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. After graduating from Swarthmore College, Heginbotham earned his PhD in political science from MIT. He is fluent in Chinese and Japanese and was a captain in the U.S. Army Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark F.

Officially established by Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2020, the Space Force garnered bipartisan support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organized within the Department of the Air Force, the USSF functions at an equal level as the U.S. Air Force, similar to how the Marine Corps is structured within the Department of the Navy. Under Title 10, Section 9081, of the U.S. Code, the Space Force has the responsibility to organize, train, and equip space-focused military forces. Specifically, the Space Force is responsible for space launch, satellite operations, surveillance of the space environment, satellite defense, and some missile defense functions. Previously, space forces and missions were scattered throughout the DoD. With the establishment of the Space Force, the DoD envisions consolidating all or many of these missions, forces, and authorities within the purview of the Space Force. The Space Force will then provide space support to other branches of the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fast-facts&quot;&gt;Fast Facts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission&lt;/strong&gt;: “[T]he USSF is responsible for organizing, training, and equipping Guardians to conduct global space operations that enhance the way our joint and coalition forces fight, while also offering decision-makers military options to achieve national objectives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;: Chief of Space Operations, four-star general (General B. Chance Saltzman); Vice Chief of Space Operations, four-star general (General David D. Thompson): and Chief Master Sergeant (CMSSF Roger A. Towberman).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motto&lt;/strong&gt;: Sempra Supra, or Always Above&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headquarters&lt;/strong&gt;: The Pentagon, Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: The Space Force is the smallest U.S. armed service, consisting of 8,600 military personnel (4,286 enlisted and 4,314 officers), 4,927 civilian personnel, and operating over 100 satellites. Its projected size is 16,000 personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FY 2023 Budget&lt;/strong&gt;: $26.3 billion. The Space Force budget for FY 2023 includes $4 billion for operations and maintenance (O&amp;amp;M); $16.6 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;amp;E); $4.4 billion for procurement; and $1.1 billion for military personnel costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Base Locations&lt;/strong&gt;: Buckley Space Force Base in Aurora, Colorado; Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo, California; Patrick Space Force Base near Satellite Beach, Florida; Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado; Schriever Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Vandenberg Space Force Base near Lompoc, California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although U.S. military space capabilities have advanced remarkably since the 1950s, they were divided amongst the different services, with the Air Force, Army, and Navy all maintaining programs focused on space. Responding to a deepening dependence on space, concerns about this disparate structure began to emerge, inspiring discussions since the 1960s over the creation of a separate space-focused service in the military. Having gained the attention of Congress, the Rumsfeld (1999-2001) and the Allard commissions (2006-2008) were created to address the organizational structure of national security space. However, despite concerning advances made by competitors in developing counterspace technology — culminating in the 2007 Chinese anti-satellite test — neither report brought about any significant reorganization. While the House-passed FY 2018 NDAA introduced the creation of a Space Corps, which was not carried forward in the final bill, it was President Trump’s 2019 directive to establish a separate military service for space that broke nearly twenty years of inaction. That proposal, which directed the standup of a Space Force within the Department of the Air Force, enjoyed bipartisan support and led to Congress passing the proposal as part of the FY 2020 NDAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-does-the-space-force-do&quot;&gt;What does the Space Force do?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Force was designed to create one organization responsible for the training, development, and acquisition of equipment to support the U.S. military’s space capabilities and operations. Fielding over 100 satellites, USSF Guardians operate and maintain command and control of satellites that provide positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT), strategic and tactical communications, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and weather. Guardians conduct space launches and operate the Nation’s space launch ranges, while also maintaining an extensive network of satellites, ground-based telescopes and radars that provide early warning of missile launches and track spacecraft and orbital debris. They are called upon to provide space superiority, employing broad offensive and defensive capabilities to support U.S. military missions. The responsibilities of the Space Force include the cultivation of space professionals, the maturation of military doctrine, and the organization of combat-ready forces for use by Combatant Commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;internal-organization&quot;&gt;Internal Organization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of the Air Force serves as the civilian leader of the Space Force and oversees both the Air Force and Space Force. For the military, the FY 2020 NDAA specified that a four-star general will serve as Chief of Space Operations (CSO) to lead the Space Force and be a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Chief Master Sergeant is the most senior enlisted advisor of the Space Force. This position “serves as the personal adviser to the Chief of Space Operations and the Secretary of the Air Force on all issues regarding the welfare, readiness, morale, proper utilization and development of the U.S. Space Force.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Force was intentionally designed to be a slim, agile, and mission-focused organization, and thus, its Guardian and staff numbers are significantly smaller than other military services in order to remove the traditional layers of bureaucracy. The Space Force relies on the Department of the Air Force to provide everyday support functions such as logistics, base operations and security, civilian personnel HR and hiring, IT support, audits and financial support, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Force is supported by three field commands, Space Operations Command (SpOC), Space Systems Command (SSC), and Space Training and Readiness Command (STARCOM), that are further separated into 16 mission Deltas (USSF organizational units) and three Base Deltas that provide mission support functions. Two acquisition organizations, the Space Development Agency (SDA) and the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), also support the Space Force and report directly to the Chief of Space Operations and the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisitions and Integration for acquisition matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A headquarters function, the Office of the Chief of Space Operations, supporting the CSO and SecAF comprises a mix of general officers and senior executive civilians in roles of deputy chiefs of space operations, including human capital; intelligence; operations, cyber, and nuclear; and strategy, plans, programs, and requirements; and technology and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the three field commands, the SpOC and SSC are led by three-star generals, and STARCOM is led by a two-star general. Each field command is supported by Deltas of around 400 personnel, each focusing on a specific mission area and containing supporting squadrons. Deltas are led by Colonels, while squadrons are led by Lieutenant Colonels.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;space-operations-command-spoc&quot;&gt;Space Operations Command (SpOC)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SpOC is responsible for operating space capabilities and presenting them to commanders for employment. SpOC is the primary force provider of space forces and capabilities for combatant commanders, coalition partners, the joint force, and the nation. Uniquely operating at the nexus of the USSF and U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM), SpOC functions as both a field command for the USSF and a service command for USSPACECOM. Guiding SpOC are three priorities: preparing (a combat-ready, ISR-led, cyber-secure force), partnering (across the U.S. government, allies, and commercial partners), and projecting (combat power in, from, and to space). Furthermore, SpOC is supported by Space Base Deltas (SBDs) 1 and 2, which provide mission support functions on military installations, such as IT and medical support. SpOC is comprised of the following nine Deltas and two Base Deltas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;space-training-and-readiness-command-starcom&quot;&gt;Space Training and Readiness Command (STARCOM)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STARCOM trains and educates space professionals and develops combat-ready space forces to address warfighting challenges in the space domain. As part of this mandate, STARCOM is also responsible for developing space warfighting doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures; as well as the testing and evaluation of USSF capabilities. STARCOM is comprised of the following Deltas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Delta 1 – Training&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;additional-organizations&quot;&gt;Additional Organizations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Development Agency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transferred to USSF from the oversight of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering in October 2022, the Space Development Agency (SDA) is responsible for the rapid delivery of space-based capabilities to the joint warfighter to support terrestrial missions. It is building a proliferated low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation, initially focused on missile tracking and SATCOM connectivity to quickly relay data to a range of warfighter platforms. Of note, SDA does not fall under the command of Space Systems Command. Instead, the SDA reports to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisitions and Integration for acquisition matters and to the Chief of Space Operations for all other matters. It retains the authority to set its own policies and decide how to develop and buy its own systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Rapid Capabilities Office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Established in the FY 18 NDAA, with further authorities granted under the FY 19 NDAA, the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (Space RCO) is a direct report to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisitions and Integration for acquisition matters and to the Chief of Space Operations for all other matters, similar to SDA. Forming another component of the USSF’s acquisition capabilities, the Space RCO is tasked with delivering “operationally dominant space capabilities at the speed of warfighting relevance.” Organized in a streamlined manner with agile decision-making authorities, a short chain-of-command, and integrated support functions like contracting, the Space RCO fills a niche within the USSF where it can take “measured risks” in developing and quickly delivering prototypes to the SSC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service Component Commands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USSF has activated three service components assigned to combatant commands to provide “service-specific administration and support functions,” as outlined in Title 10, U.S. Code. Service Component commands are personnel, units, organizations, or other support forces that belong to a distinct military service but are assigned to support a Combatant Commander. SpOC performs the service component function for U.S. Space Command (SPACECOM). As of December 2022, the USSF also supports two regional combatant commands and a sub-unified command, with component commands at U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM), U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), and U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM). These service components will “integrate at the component level and provide combatant commanders a subordinate space commander, organic space planning and employment expertise, and space command and control that is focused on the joint force’s operational warfighting priorities and requirements.” In the future, additional space component commands will likely emerge at many, if not all, of the other combatant commands.&lt;/p&gt;

Then came the Great Frost of 1708–9. Birds were said to have frozen in midflight and dropped dead to the ground. Charles’s army of more than 40,000 men soon lost half its strength from exposure and starvation. In an attempt to escape the cold, the Swedish king led the remnants of his army south into Ukraine to join the Cossack leader, Hetman Ivan Mazepa, and his forces. But the damage was done. The following summer, Peter’s Russian army routed Charles’s weakened forces at the Battle of Poltava, bringing an end to Sweden’s empire and its designs on Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Swedes were neither the first nor the last European army to suffer the ravages of “General Winter” on Russia’s frontiers. Exacerbated by the vast expanse of the Eurasian landmass, winter fighting there has often proved to be the downfall of great armies. For centuries, this phenomenon has often worked to Russia’s advantage, as a succession of powerful militaries have succumbed to inadequate equipment, deficient supply lines, and poor preparation. But as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine enters the harshest months of the year, there are many indications that this time it may be Russia, rather than its adversary, that suffers the worst consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;his-empire-for-a-horse&quot;&gt;His Empire for a Horse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s best-known winter defeat in Russia came in 1812 — just over a century after the Battle of Poltava — when Napoleon’s Grande Armée retreated from Moscow. Russia’s scorched-earth tactics, which left the French with no food or shelter along the line of withdrawal, made the effect even more deadly. Yet the greatest casualties had occurred earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Grande Armée had been almost half a million strong when it crossed the River Neman, the frontier between Prussia and Russia, in June 1812. But it soon lost a third of its strength from summer heat, disease, hunger, and exhaustion as the emperor forced his men on toward Moscow. Although the retreat into Russia’s expanse was unintended at first, Tsar Alexander I’s commanders soon realized the advantage. They kept withdrawing east and did not make a stand until General Mikhail Kutuzov was ordered to halt Napoleon at Borodino, 75 miles west of Moscow. The battle proved a costly victory for the French, even though it enabled them to enter Moscow unopposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was the approaching winter that proved fatal for the invaders. Napoleon wasted five weeks in Moscow expecting the tsar to come to terms. When the Grande Armée finally started to withdraw to central Europe on October 19, the soldiers were still wearing their summer uniforms. They had also lost their baggage trains and could expect little food along the way. Their greatest deficiency was in cavalry to hold off marauding Cossacks. The shaggy Cossack ponies were accustomed to the winter blizzards, which began a month later, while the last of the chargers and draft horses from western Europe collapsed from the cold and lack of forage. Starving soldiers hacked off their meat even before they were dead. Desertion or surrender was far from a guarantee of survival. Avenging Cossacks waited to skewer enemy soldiers on their long lances; Russian peasants simply slaughtered them with scythes. By early December, Napoleon feared a coup d’état during his absence, and, abandoning his army, headed for Paris before his frozen men could reach safety. By this point, his forces had suffered nearly 400,000 casualties, and he had lost his reputation for invincibility on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less well known, although perhaps equally significant, was the way Russia won. Despite having lost 200,000 of its own men, Russia’s military leadership was far less concerned about casualties than was Napoleon. Russian officers still treated their peasant soldiers as little better than serfs (and serfdom would not be abolished in Russia for another 50 years). This lack of interest in soldiers’ well-being — and the casual attitude to massive losses through so-called meat-grinder tactics — are apparent in Putin’s army in Ukraine today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;red-terror-white-frost&quot;&gt;Red Terror, White Frost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another half century later, in World War I, the attitude of Russia’s military authorities had barely changed. Their men were expendable. Trench life for the rank and file along the eastern front that ran through Belorussia, Galicia, and Romania from 1915 to 1917 was an inhuman experience. And many resented that officers retired each night to the warmth and relative comfort of peasant log huts behind the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Having dug themselves into the ground,” the Russian writer and anti-tsarist Maxim Gorky observed of the enlisted men, “they live in rain and snow, in filth, in cramped conditions; they are being worn out by disease and eaten by vermin; they live like beasts.” Many lacked boots and had to resort to bast shoes made from birch bark. Stations for treating the wounded at the front were almost as primitive as they had been in the Crimean War. This reality was in cruel contrast to the photographs of the tsarina and her grand duchess daughters immaculately dressed as nurses before the February 1917 revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter conditions in the Russian Civil War (1917–­21) were even worse. The most pitiful victims were the civilian refugees fleeing the Bolshevik onslaught, or what became known as the Red Terror. During the winter of 1919, the collapse of Admiral Kolchak’s White Russian armies in Siberia produced terrible scenes along the jammed Trans-Siberian Railroad. Aristocrats, middle-class families, and anti-Bolsheviks of all backgrounds were trying to escape to Vladivostok in the Russian Far East to avoid capture by the Communist Red Army, which was advancing from the Urals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In World War I, many Russians lacked boots and had to resort to shoes made of birch bark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By mid-December of that year, the Reds caught up with the tail of the line and took the southern Siberian city and industrial hub of Novo-Nikolaevsk (present-day Novosibirsk), along with numerous trains still blocked there. The city itself was in the grip of a typhus epidemic. All horses, carts, and sledges available had already been taken, so the desperate set out on foot, not knowing that farther ahead in Krasnoyarsk cases had reached more than 30,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A mass retreat is one of the saddest and most despairing sights in the world,” Captain Brian Horrocks, a British officer in the Allied intervention in Russia, wrote. “The sick just fell down and died in the snow.” He was horrified by the squalid conditions faced even by those refugees who had managed to find a place in packed cattle wagons. Most wagons lacked any heating as temperatures dropped to as low as minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit. “The thing which impressed me most was the fortitude with which the women, many of them reared in luxury, were facing their hopeless future,” he wrote. “The menfolk were much more given to self-pity.” Kolchak’s staff officers were by then drinking themselves into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As White Russian, Czech, and Polish commanders argued bitterly over priority for their troop trains, starving and frozen refugees were dying at an alarming rate. One officer wrote that trains at some Siberian stations were unloading hundreds of bodies of people who had died from cold and disease. “These bodies were stacked up at the stations like so much cordwood,” another officer wrote. “Those who remained alive never talked, never thought of anything save how they might escape death and get farther and farther away from the Bolsheviks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the northern Caucasus, known for its blazing summer heat, winter could sometimes produce drops in temperature of more than 22 degrees Fahrenheit in less than an hour. In February 1920, General Dmitry Pavlov’s cavalry divisions were caught in the open by a sudden blizzard. Pavlov “lost half of his horses which froze in the steppe,” the Red Army high command noted. But the human losses were far worse. “We left behind in the steppe thousands of men frozen to death, and the blizzard buried them,” a Cossack officer recounted. Those who survived did so by huddling against their horses. Pavlov, who had ignored warnings of the possible change in the weather, suffered severe frostbite himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stalins-ice-breakers&quot;&gt;Stalin’s Ice Breakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the twentieth century, winter conditions on the Eurasian landmass posed a growing threat not just to humans and horses but also to military weaponry. Sometimes this worked to Russia’s detriment. Despite its disproportionate strength and its massive expenditure of ammunition, the Soviet army failed to break Finnish resistance in the Winter War of 1939–40, following Stalin’s invasion of Finland. The Finns, proving themselves even better practitioners of winter tactics than their invaders, terrorized Red Army soldiers by day and night as their white-camouflaged ski troops launched surprise attacks from forests, then disappeared like ghosts. Their bravery and skill persuaded Stalin to accept Finland’s independence. But it also served as a lesson for the war to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the rapid military mechanization between the two world wars, the Soviet Union had created the largest tank force in the world. The Red Army at least learned that guns and engines needed special lubricants in extreme conditions. Such measures proved key in Stalin’s ability to block Hitler’s armies in front of Moscow in December 1941. Both the German army and the Luftwaffe were unprepared. They had to light fires under their vehicles and aircraft engines to defrost them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German soldiers referred bitterly to winter conditions as “weather for Russians.” They envied the Red Army’s winter uniforms, with white camouflage suits and padded cotton jackets, which were far more effective than German greatcoats. Russian military historians have attributed the comparatively low rate of frostbite and trench foot among Soviet forces to their old military practice of using layered linen foot bandages instead of socks. German soldiers also suffered more rapidly because their jackboots had steel studs that drained any warmth. In February 1943, when the remnants of Field Marshal Paulus’s Sixth Army finally surrendered at Stalingrad — the psychological turning point of World War II — more than 90,000 German prisoners limped out of the city on frost-ravaged feet. Yet their suffering had been caused less by cold than by Hitler’s orders to hold on there and the inability of German panzers with their narrow tracks to counterattack in the snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Winter also played a major role in the Red Army’s final victory in 1945. The great Soviet breakthrough in January, a charge from the River Vistula to the River Oder, depended on the weather. Russian forecasters had predicted “a strange winter,” with “heavy rain and wet snow” after the hard frosts of January. An order went out to repair boots. Stalin and the Red Army’s supreme command set January 12 as the start date for the offensive, so that the Soviets’ tank armies could take advantage of the deep-frozen ground before any thaw set in. Characteristically, Stalin falsely claimed that he had advanced the date from January 20 to take pressure off the Americans in the Ardennes. (U.S. forces had already halted the German offensive there just after Christmas.) In fact, there was another motive: Stalin wanted to control the bulk of Polish territory before he met U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill at Yalta in the first week of February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More than 90,000 German prisoners limped out of Stalingrad on frost-ravaged feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stalin’s commanders did not let him down. “Our tanks move faster than the trains to Berlin,” boasted the ebullient Colonel Iosif Gusakovsky. He had not bothered to wait for bridging equipment to reach the frontlines before attempting to cross the River Pilica. He simply ordered his leading tanks to smash the ice with gunfire, then to drive straight across the riverbed. The tanks, acting like icebreakers, pushed the ice aside “with a terrible thundering noise,” a terrifying experience for the poor drivers. The German eastern front in Poland collapsed under the armored onslaught, once again because the Soviet T-34’s broad tracks could cope with the ice and snow far better than any German panzer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 1945, the Red Army’s achievements in winter warfare gave it a fearsome reputation in the West. It was not until the Soviet Union’s ill-planned invasion of Czechoslovakia in the summer of 1968 — the Warsaw Pact forces lacked maps, food supplies, and fuel — that Western analysts first began to suspect that they might have overestimated the Soviets’ warfighting abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the 1980s, the collapse of the Soviet empire was marked by its doomed struggle to control Afghanistan, a terrain that made winter warfare impossible for conventional armies. Then, during the economic collapse in the 1990s, Russian President Boris Yeltsin’s government often proved unable to pay officers and soldiers alike and corruption became institutionalized. Conscripts were frequently on the edge of starvation because their rations were sold off; theft, bullying, and ill discipline became rampant. Spare parts from vehicles, as well as anything from fuel to light bulbs, boots, and especially any cold weather kit, disappeared onto the black market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption became even worse following Russia’s chaotic invasion of Georgia in 2008. Putin began throwing money at the armed forces. The waste on prestige projects encouraged contractors and generals alike to pad their bank accounts. Little appears to have been done in reassessing military doctrine. The Russian idea of urban warfare had still not evolved from World War II, with their artillery, the “god of war,” smashing everything to rubble. This approach would continue during Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war from 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Putin’s greatest triumph in Russian eyes was the covert seizure of Crimea the year before by infiltrating it with un-uniformed “little green men” from special forces. This was part of Putin’s angry reaction to the Maidan revolution in Kyiv, which forced his ally President Viktor Yanukovych to flee and led to the start of fighting in the Donbas region of Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;putin-in-denial&quot;&gt;Putin in Denial&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, eight years later, Putin launched his “special military operation” in Ukraine. At the time, the vanguard was told to bring their parade uniforms ready to celebrate victory — one of the greatest examples of military hubris in history. Yet seven disastrous months later, when the Kremlin was finally forced to order a “partial mobilization” of the Russian population, it had to warn those called up that uniforms and equipment were in short supply. They would have to provide their own body armor and even ask their mothers and girlfriends for sanitary pads to use instead of field dressings. The lack of bandages is astonishing, especially now as winter intensifies, since they are vital to keep frost from entering open wounds. Adding to the dangers are mortar rounds hitting frozen ground: unlike soft mud, which absorbs most of the blast, frozen ground causes fragments to ricochet, in sometimes lethal ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s new commander in chief in the south, General Sergei Surovikin, is determined to clamp down on attempts by some conscripts to avoid combat. Many have been resorting to the sabotage of fuel, weapons, and vehicles, to say nothing of self-inflicted wounds and desertion. Yet the Russian army’s long-standing structural problem — its shortage of experienced noncommissioned officers — has also led to a terrible record of maintaining weapons, equipment, and vehicles. These problems will become especially costly in winter with sensitive technology such as drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As both sides enter a far more challenging season of fighting, the outcome will largely depend on morale and determination. While Russian troops curse their shortages and lack of hot food, Ukrainian troops are now benefiting from supplies of insulated camouflage suits, tents with stoves, and sleeping bags provided by Canada and the Nordic nations. Putin seems to be in denial about the state of his army and the way that General Winter will favor his opponents. He may also have made another mistake by concentrating his missiles against Ukraine’s energy network and its vulnerable civilian population. They will endure the greatest suffering, but there is little chance that they will break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing wariness of governments in Australia, the US and the UK over potential foreign state interference by countries like Russia and China in their domestic affairs has sparked a greater examination of the tactics and objectives of malign state actors. However, the debate over this challenge is unclear in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malign interference can be characterised as activity that takes place through covert means that obfuscate the role of the state directing the activity, not in conformity to national law, is conducted through coercive means, or seeks to create confusion amongst a population through disinformation efforts. The paper also briefly discusses the concept of ‘sharp power’, which best captures the unique nature of the threat of political interference – namely, co-optation of key decision-makers, influencers and thought leaders for the purpose of internalising, advocating for or advancing the interests of foreign authoritarian powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across Southeast Asia, a region of strategic interest to authoritarian and democratic countries alike for its economic dynamism and strategic location, public debate and academic engagement on the question of foreign state interference is limited. This is likely due to political sensitivities over whether governments are seen to be sufficiently addressing the challenge and, where it concerns China, whether they could be seen as taking sides in the wider geopolitical tension between China and the US. Discussion around domestic actor malign interference, for example through disinformation on social media platforms, is somewhat easier, as seen in the case study chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the sensitivity of the subject of state interference, this paper primarily relies on open source material, supplemented by interviews with key policymakers and experts in Southeast Asia under rules of non-attribution. The paper analyses the main vectors of malign foreign influence across key Southeast Asian states, as well as the region’s geopolitical relevance to authoritarian foreign states potentially interested in conducting interference for political objectives. The combination of these three factors affects their vulnerability to malign foreign influence. While this paper cannot address the challenge of foreign state interference in its entirety or map each country’s specific experience in depth, it seeks to offer a starting point for further research and discussions. The paper provides brief policy recommendations as a basis for this. It goes without saying that any long-term solution should be anchored in a systematic recognition of the agency of Southeast Asian states in light of their decades-long struggle for autonomy and national development. However, given the international challenge of foreign state interference, this paper highlights a few ways in which partner countries who are seeking to mitigate their own domestic experiences of the challenge can work with Southeast Asian countries to share lessons learned and exchange issues on risk mitigation. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue support for local media and civil society.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offer alternatives where investment is needed in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase information exchange on malign interference.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Help develop risk mitigation strategies in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intensification of strategic competition among states is increasingly taking place in the ‘grey zone’ between acceptable state activity and interference, with the aim of pursuing national strategic interests without resorting to war. States by nature seek to influence one another to protect their interests; this is entirely legitimate when the state-led activity takes place transparently and within legal means, but it becomes malign interference when the activity takes place through covert means which obfuscate the role of the state directing the activity, is not in conformity with national law, is conducted through coercive means, or seeks to create confusion for a population through disinformation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberal democracies are increasingly becoming aware of this grey zone threat. The UK and allies such as the US and Australia have increasingly revealed malign interference activity within their borders and have attributed it to Iran, Russia and China, to varying extents. Authoritarian regimes engaged in strategic competition below the threshold of outright war, such as Iran, Russia and China, seek to weaken democratic systems through economic interference, information operations and political influence. While investigative journalism, academic research and institutional checks and balances have exposed a range of activities in these countries and have driven further enquiry, it is not clear to what extent malign interference activity is taking place outside of Europe and specific countries, such as Australia and the US, where the issue of malign interference has been politically and publicly explored as a serious challenge to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close allies and partners such as the UK, US and Australia are seeking to engage more strategically in the Indo-Pacific and specifically Southeast Asia, as laid out in their various national strategies, policy documents and official statements. While there are many reasons for this, including economic opportunity, one common security concern is potential growing Chinese influence and interference, through both legitimate and illegitimate means, and the challenge that this presents to their interests. These countries’ engagement in the region includes upholding shared principles such as economic sustainability, free trade based on equal access, and democratic principles of transparency and good governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is not able to encompass the entirety of types of interference, nor does it purport to comprehensively cover all potential political, economic and informational interference activities. For the purposes of this study, the paper will examine a few case studies in Southeast Asia in terms of the following potential avenues for interference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Informational: including attempts to use social media or other platforms to advance pro-hostile-state messaging or narratives, as well as hostile states seeking to influence local media communities in order to advance their narratives. It includes, for example, activities of foreign diplomatic missions and their proxies, as well as overseas associations, aimed at manipulating national media outlets and social media platforms through the deliberate propagation of falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Political: influential communities, subversive actors. This includes efforts to become involved in local politics or influential communities, or with local communities of any ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic: purchase of or investment in sensitive critical national infrastructure (CNI), defined as infrastructure that is either critical to national GDP or is in a sensitive area such as telecommunications or national defence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the focus of Western liberal states on Southeast Asia as part of their Indo-Pacific strategies, this paper seeks to understand whether malign interference activity by authoritarian states across the 10 ASEAN member states (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) is seen as a destabilising threat to national security. It seeks to better understand the current level of debate in Southeast Asia on influence versus interference as a foreign policy tool, and will examine to what extent malign interference activity by authoritarian states is taking place in the region and what the responses have been to any existing or potential malign interference. It will focus primarily on China as the largest actor in Southeast Asia, but will also discuss Iran, Russia and North Korea as authoritarian regimes whose activities are of concern to liberal democracies like the UK, US and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper offers examples of activity of concern, highlights potential vulnerabilities and strengths, and aims to underscore regional responses to and perspectives on this global challenge. One main finding is that the political sensitivity around malign interference activities in this region means that the debate on this topic in Southeast Asia is less prominent publicly than, for example, it is in Australia, the US or Europe. This is a particularly sensitive topic due to the debate over national security and whether governments are responding sufficiently to threats, as well as the fact that debates around China are by their very nature difficult in the region, as countries actively seek not to take sides in what is seen as a geopolitical competition between the US and Southeast Asia’s top trading partner. This limits the willingness of individuals, irrespective of sector, to discuss such topics openly, while academic debate seems likewise limited. Discussion around domestic actor malign interference, particularly with regard to disinformation, remains a serious challenge in the region, as discussed in the case study chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology employed in the research for this paper has chiefly consisted of desk-based open source research, as well as semi-structured interviews for the purpose of supplementing research findings and engaging with specific experts on influence and interference activities in the region. For the purposes of the regional overview chapter, 15 interviews on the three types of potential interference activities that this paper examines were conducted with experts from and based in the region. Interviews were conducted under the Chatham House Rule, and as such any information used is non-attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I presents a regional overview of all 10 focus countries. The subsequent three chapters, one on each area vulnerable to malign interference activity, were authored by experts based in Southeast Asia and selected for their expertise in the areas they explore. In Chapter II, Benjamin Ang defines what constitutes information operations and hostile actions and explores the countermeasures put in place by the governments of Malaysia and Singapore. In Chapter III, Richard Javad Heydarian assesses the potential vulnerability to ‘sharp power’ as a form of political interference in the region. In Chapter IV, Ryan Clarke explores the debate around potential economic interference in Southeast Asia by China, focusing specifically on the example of Chinese investment in high-speed rail in Malaysia, Laos and Thailand as part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the region. Clarke examines, in particular, the potentially political nature of infrastructure investment. The paper concludes with a summary of the key findings of the regional overview and subsequent thematic chapters, and presents policy recommendations for the UK and partners inside and outside Southeast Asia seeking to support countries in the region to mitigate the challenge of malign interference activities by states. While this study ultimately focuses on China in particular, it is not able to delve into whether other countries are engaged in similar interference activities; there is therefore a need for further research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;regional-overview&quot;&gt;Regional Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current scholarly and think tank literature on the question of malign interference by state actors in the 10 ASEAN member states is limited, particularly when pertaining to specific analyses of economic interference, political interference and information operations. The limited public engagement on these topics is equally reflected in the number of experts in Southeast Asia specialising in malign interference by states. In some countries, such as Laos, it would appear that there is no in-country expertise on the subject, while in others requests for expert interviews were met with a muted response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of academic engagement and public debate seems to negatively impact the baseline understanding of the subject, as seen in a confusion as to what constitutes influence and interference, and what differentiates one from the other. Without a firm understanding of the theoretical concepts involved, explorations of the subject within a national context risk drawing incorrect conclusions. This chapter first defines the concepts of influence versus interference before exploring the extent of academic and expert debate on malign interference by states in each of the 10 focus countries in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interference-or-influence&quot;&gt;Interference or Influence?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Influence’ can be understood as legitimate action that involves public, ‘above board’ activities. ‘Interference’ is illegitimate or illicit action, encompassing, for example, activities that are covert, coercive or corrupt, including cyber attacks and disinformation operations. These are malign when they seek to harm or go against the interests of the state they are targeting. Former CIA director John Brennan, rebutting claims by former president Donald Trump that China had attempted to interfere with the 2018 US midterm elections, made such a distinction. In 2017, then-prime minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull, in a speech introducing new legislative amendments on espionage and foreign interference, specified that activities in support of foreign governments are not illegal unless they are ‘covert, coercive or corrupt’, making the distinction between ‘legitimate influence and unacceptable interference’. However, previously legal means of exerting influence, such as political funding, are now only considered legitimate if they are transparent, as the Australian Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Public Register and associated legislation seeks to ensure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In literature and policy on the topic, the distinction is generally less sharp. Indeed, Adam Henschke, Matthew Sussex and Courteney O’Connor suggest that creating a distinction between foreign influence and foreign interference is ‘unhelpful outside a strict regulatory context’ because both can be used to undermine democratic processes. They note that hostile actors can exploit ‘grey spaces between legal influence and illegal interference’ and adapt in ways that provide them with plausible deniability. For instance, these authors do not categorise disinformation in election campaigns or longer-term propaganda and lobbying efforts as interference, as they are not illegal; instead, they point to activities such as corruption or tampering with election results as examples of interference. Both, however, are damaging. Making a similar point, Alex Joske highlights the risks of disaggregating activity under China’s United Front system, noting the importance of considering the impact of the consolidated effort rather than assessing activities in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This serves to emphasise the lack of common definitions of foreign influence and foreign interference, as well as the challenge of finding a widely accepted distinction between the two terms. Kristine Berzina and Etienne Soula note that such ambiguity ‘can delay or complicate lawmakers’ initiatives and muddy civil society’s efforts to build awareness and rally opposition against incursions into democratic processes’. While acknowledging the risks of creating a definition that is too broad and may thus curb freedom of expression, too narrow so as to exclude certain activities, or too focused on tactics and consequently not flexible enough to adapt to evolving technologies, they propose that the core criteria in determining whether an activity constitutes interference should be intent and transparency. Michael N Schmitt characterises ‘intervention’ as activities that impact matters otherwise left to the sole discretion of the state, such as the ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’, and distinguishes it from influence by pointing to the involvement of coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Australian context, Katherine Mansted argues that given the emerging grey zone between acceptable state-based activity and interference, it may be useful ‘to move policy frameworks and public discourse beyond a binary divide between “influence” and “interference” and instead to think of foreign influence along a continuum of risk’. The measures she proposes include updating legislation to capture influence activities that may be ‘precursors’ to foreign interference, such as data collection, surveillance and media ownership. Writing about Chinese influence and interference in the UK, Charles Parton proposes a spectrum from ‘acceptable influence activities, through unwanted but tolerable interference, to unacceptable interference against which action is required’. Andrew Chubb has written extensively on China’s overseas political activities in the UK and Australia, and explores this in greater detail. Using case studies from both the UK and Australia, Chubb stresses the need to recognise the differences between issues of national security, human rights and academic freedom, and offers recommendations for what targeted responses might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government clearly outlines the distinction between foreign influence and interference, describing the former as activities ‘conducted in an open and transparent manner’ that ‘contribute positively to public debate’ and the latter as activities that are ‘coercive, corrupting, deceptive, [and] clandestine’ and that are ‘contrary to Australia’s sovereignty, values and national interests’. The Canadian government appears to use the terms interchangeably. The US does not articulate a distinction between foreign influence and foreign interference, but clearly defines the latter in the context of elections in an executive order entitled ‘Imposing Certain Sanctions in the Event of Foreign Interference in a United States Election’, signed by then-president Donald Trump in 2018 and extended by President Joe Biden in September 2021. The order defines foreign interference as ‘covert, fraudulent, deceptive, or unlawful actions … undertaken with the purpose or effect of influencing, undermining confidence in, or altering the result or reported result of, the election, or undermining public confidence in election processes or institutions’. However, the FBI refers to activities that seem to fall under foreign interference according to the above definition as ‘foreign influence’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This regional overview focuses specifically on instances of interference by authoritarian state actors. Interviewees and other sources did not always clearly differentiate between influence and interference, and over the course of this review, conflation between the two terms in Southeast Asia was prevalent. Overwhelmingly, China arose most frequently when discussing sources of potential state-led or state-directed interference. Mention of Russia was only made on three occasions, and in two of these instances (from Myanmar and Vietnam) the relationship should be interpreted as benign. Iran is also viewed as a benign actor in at least two countries. As seen in the following country-specific overviews, there is clearly a distinct paucity of research and publications about malign interference activities by states across Southeast Asia, and the only significant work on this subject, with the exception of Singapore, has been undertaken extra-regionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Brunei, there are no publicly avowed examples of disinformation campaigns and no discourse about interference among public intellectuals. There are, however, concerns harboured within the Bruneian establishment over hidden debt, compromise of public health data, and elite capture. Proprietary interviews with regional security specialists reveal growing concerns that China is increasingly aggressively pursuing its elite capture strategy in order to secure exclusive rights to Brunei’s enormous onshore and offshore oil and natural gas reserves. One prominent method consists of offering free shares and other economic interests in Chinese companies that would be involved. These incentives span the entire spectrum of a project, from shares in the drilling equipment company to shares in the company that is involved in retail distribution in China. As these are Chinese corporate entities, their shareholding structures and other relevant data are deemed to be state secrets under China’s relevant law, thereby shielding any Bruneian officials from scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia and Laos, as states close to China and in line with the authoritarian nature of their regimes, are so penetrated by Chinese geopolitical interests that there is no obvious domestic discourse on malign interference activity by the authoritarian states under examination in this paper. Approaches made to public intellectuals were met with a limited response. There are, however, a handful of dissidents and opponents to the regime who have written on the subject of foreign political interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Cambodia, China has increasingly sought to position itself as a ‘no questions asked’ provider of dual-use infrastructure investment, especially in port/maritime facilities such as the recent Ream Naval Base. Sources in the financial services industry note that China appears to view Cambodia in a similar light as Laos and therefore as readily available for elite capture. China is also actively incentivising key government officials to execute Mekong-origin water-sharing agreements that are not in Cambodia’s long-term interests by (similar to the methods used in Brunei) offering shares and other considerations in Chinese companies that are involved in Mekong water management projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Laos, Chinese law enforcement has significantly increased its presence, extending extra-territorial control, particularly in casino zones on the border with China. Similar to Cambodia, financial industry sources note that China has been able to negotiate Mekong-origin water-sharing terms that disproportionately favour China by actively exerting influence on parties representing the Laotian side. In particular, the construction of new dams in Laos with heavy investment by China has prompted concern over Laos’ debt burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, there appears to be awareness of, and research on, Chinese and Russian cyber operations aimed at interfering in the 2019 Indonesian election. The Chinese digital footprint is so large and pervasive in Indonesia that Jakarta’s exposure to interference in the digital domain is significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews with experts and some reporting on the subject reveal an attempt by Chinese state-backed cyber units or Chinese companies to control and/or manipulate telecommunications providers, as well as allegedly censoring material critical of China in acquired Indonesian news aggregator app Baca Berita. Analysis of the methods and technologies used by these Chinese cyber operators suggests some links to China’s People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, in the Philippines, there is a well-documented debate about China’s investment in the country’s CNI, including the power grid and the telecommunications sector. In 2019, media reports cited concerns over the installation of China Telecom infrastructure on Philippines military bases through a deal struck with Filipino-Chinese tycoon Denis Uy. In the run-up to presidential elections in 2022 there appeared to be lively but sensitive debate about the potential for Chinese interference, but no specific allegations have been made since the elections were held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews with financial industry executives have noted a strategy of ‘elite capture by proxy’ in the Philippines, whereby Chinese state interests were being furthered without attracting attention. Other notable research on the Philippines includes work on Chinese disinformation on social media and China’s CNI investment there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an awareness of China’s ability to interfere in Malaysia, but there are few well-documented cases of outright interference. There may be concerns over disinformation campaigns concerning vaccine diplomacy and human rights violations against the Uyghur population in China. Elite capture appears to be a favoured approach by Beijing in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the security situation in Myanmar, no public intellectuals in the country are currently contactable. One interview with a Myanmar expert in the region suggests that interference and disinformation operations are active on two fronts: China’s ability to penetrate Myanmar’s digital ecosystem and to leverage its support of ethnic armed groups; and Russia’s efforts to assist the Burmese government in psychological operations and disinformation campaigns. Further literature includes discussion of the Chinese presence in Myanmar and China’s proposed railways through Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore is a regional centre of expertise on the methodologies of hostile state actors, interference and disinformation operations, especially following the country’s recently introduced Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (FICA). There is little discourse on the specifics of how Singapore’s Chinese-speaking community may have been penetrated by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the large embedded and wealthy ethnic Chinese population in Thailand, Chinese cultural and economic penetration of the country is overt. The Thai establishment may, however, be concerned over encroachment on Thai sovereignty through large Chinese-funded infrastructure projects. Regional security experts also note that there is growing concern over the fact that China is increasingly attempting to acquire controlling equity stakes in leading Thai media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam takes a robust approach to online disinformation campaigns by China and has a long history of tackling Chinese attempts at interference. There is a concern about hidden debt and closely guarded relationships within the business elites of both countries. As the Vietnamese information environment is not presently conducive to Thai-style information operations, a more coercive, direct influence approach has been observed by one industry executive interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;malign-actor-interference-in-southeast-asia-information-operations-and-what-constitutes-hostile-action&quot;&gt;Malign Actor Interference in Southeast Asia: Information Operations and What Constitutes ‘Hostile Action’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benjamin Ang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a spectrum of information operations in Southeast Asia. At one end there are open and legitimate operations, which are generally acceptable to states, while at the other are hostile, deceptive and illegitimate operations by malign actors, which are generally considered as foreign interference that is not acceptable to the target states. For the purposes of this chapter, ‘malign actors’ refers to entities that carry out the latter operations, and ‘target states’ refers to states where such actions are taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These malign actors include both foreign and domestic entities, with different objectives in the target state:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Businesses, which may be seeking to discourage government regulation or attempting to circumvent existing laws.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NGOs, which may be seeking to change the policies of the target state for ideological or political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Religious groups, which may be seeking to change the society in the target state or to radicalise believers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loosely organised groups sharing the same ideology, which may be seeking to change society or ways of thinking in the target state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;States, which may be seeking to disrupt the foreign policy of the target state or to destabilise the target state for strategic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domestic malign actors pose a challenge, especially in Southeast Asia, because it can be unclear where to draw the line between hostile action and legitimate political action, especially when viewed from a Western perspective of free speech and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;definition-information-operations-and-hostile-action&quot;&gt;Definition: Information Operations and ‘Hostile Action’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To first examine foreign information operations, this research refers to the framework proposed in the 2022 S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) policy report, ‘Cases of Foreign Interference in Asia’. This framework is shown in Figure 1. In the figure, the actions encircled in green are generally acceptable to states, while those encircled in red are generally not acceptable to Southeast Asian states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the RSIS framework, ‘influence’ is the ability to shape the preferences of others using ‘information’ and/or ‘interference’. ‘Soft power’ is a well-accepted form of influence through appeal and attraction, which includes non-coercive means like culture, political values, foreign policies, public diplomacy, strategic communications, foreign aid, civic action, economic reconstruction and development, film, TV, books, and other media, economic ties, trade, business, and open ties with educational institutions and think tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information is another form of influence. Most Southeast Asian states accept information that spreads through open means, including media syndication (for example, foreign TV shows such as Game of Thrones are popular in Southeast Asia), media ownership (for example, foreign-owned TV channels such as CNN, Fox News, CCTV and CGTN are widely watched in Southeast Asia), open advertisement campaigns (for example, advertisements for foreign businesses like McDonalds are common in local Southeast Asian newspapers), op-eds where authorship is transparent (such as commentaries written by foreigners and published in local newspapers), and public statements (for example, by foreign diplomats or business leaders), with ‘hostile intent’ to disrupt their politics and policies deliberately, covertly and deceptively. For example, Singapore has described such actions as a ‘live and serious threat for Singapore’ and refers to them as ‘hostile information campaigns’ (HICs). This term is also used by some European scholars to describe Russian activities in hybrid warfare. There is no official or statutory definition in Singapore, but HICs usually describes covert or coordinated attempts by malign actors to penetrate different segments and levels of society to create and spread information that will manipulate public sentiment and harm national interests. This chapter uses the term ‘HICs’ to refer to information operations that are hostile actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: RSIS Framework for Influence, Information and Interference.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rsis.edu.sg/rsis-publication/cens/cases-of-foreign-interference-in-asia/&quot;&gt;Muhammad Faizal Bin Abdul Rahman et al., ‘Cases of Foreign Interference in Asia’, RSIS Policy Report, 26 March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, p. 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Southeast Asian states will not tolerate ‘information operations’ that are undertaken Interference, as defined in the RSIS framework, is the other unacceptable means of influence exerted by malign actors, where the malign actor acts (with or without information operations) with hostile intent to disrupt the politics and policies of the target state deliberately, covertly and deceptively. These actions include covert funding (bribes) or coercion (blackmail) of politicians and political parties, government officials, influential people and business groups, NGOs and activists, academics, and educational institutions. Accusations of foreign interference in elections have been made in Malaysia and the Philippines, but lie beyond the scope of this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These definitions, particularly the element of covert action to disrupt states, can be applied to several recent reports on China’s growing influence in Southeast Asian media, highlighting that China’s Xinhua News Agency has established content exchange deals with many Southeast Asian news services and that Chinese chambers of commerce have sponsored trips for journalists. These actions would not fall within the RSIS definition of HICs because they are public, not covert, and they seek to create a positive view of China, not to harm the target states. Southeast Asian states do not appear to be raising alarms over these actions and note that Western news agencies and businesses also do the same. However, if any malign actor were to carry out similar actions covertly, the response might be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;measuring-the-volume-of-hostile-information-campaigns&quot;&gt;Measuring the Volume of Hostile Information Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HICs can obscure themselves by employing different media and channels to address different segments of society. Sometimes the target state may detect unusual activity during times of tension between states, which the target state then attributes to HICs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when Singapore and Malaysia were disputing maritime and airspace issues in 2018, Singapore noticed a ‘curious spike’ in online comments critical of Singapore on social media, using anonymous accounts, and instances where ‘avatar accounts’ (that is, accounts whose profile photos do not show the user’s face) accounted for about 40% of comments on the social media pages of alternative media. While Singapore described this as an HIC, it did not attribute the action to any state. However, the minister for home affairs noted in Parliament in 2019 that when states are in conflict, one can use an HIC to destabilise the other. For the purposes of this chapter, these actions appear to constitute an HIC because they are covert and coordinated actions (anonymous accounts) aimed at manipulating sentiment against the interests of the target state (turning Singaporean public sentiment against the country’s position on maritime and airspace rights).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore considers HICs such a ‘live and serious threat’ that it convened a Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods in 2018, with public oral representations from 65 individuals and organisations. This event culminated in a 176-page report which found that Singapore ‘has been and will continue to be a target of hostile information campaigns’ which attack the country’s national security, racial harmony, democratic processes, social cohesion and trust in public institutions. Singapore has since passed legislation against deliberate online falsehoods (Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act) and foreign interference (FICA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cases-of-hostile-information-campaigns&quot;&gt;Cases of Hostile Information Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While various Southeast Asian states have detected, or at least strongly suspected, cases of HICs, there is no published research measuring the impact of these campaigns. There are no published datasets that contain data which is observable, replicable and verifiable. These criteria would be necessary for measuring impact, for example using a model like the Breakout Scale from Brookings, which measures impact based on whether information remains on one platform or travels across multiple platforms, and whether it remains in one community or is spread through many communities. However, this requires data-gathering and analytics capabilities that are either lacking in Southeast Asian states or are only available to state intelligence services and are kept classified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a global issue, as empirical research on the impacts of such operations, such as altering beliefs, changing voting behaviour or inspiring political violence, is still limited and is focused on Western countries and their platforms. However, since some of the known studies show that targeted information operations can lead to increased political violence in settings of conflict or civil unrest, the threat posed by such operations cannot be dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed, especially in Southeast Asian states, to measure the impact of these operations. This will require funding, access to data, cross-disciplinary cooperation and, above all, the political will to drive these factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singapore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading up to the introduction of legislation against HICs, Singapore has highlighted several instances of information operations conducted by foreign malign actors. Some of these are decades old, and they do not involve China, Russia, Iran or North Korea, but, importantly, they do illustrate that Singapore does not welcome foreign interference from either east or west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1964, a Singaporean businessman received a substantial loan from high-ranking officials of a communist intelligence service based in Hong Kong to establish the Eastern Sun, an English-language daily newspaper in Singapore, giving these officials access to the press in Singapore. The businessman confessed and the paper closed with the resignation of the editorial staff. This fits the definition of an HIC because it was a covert action (the loan was private) to manipulate sentiment against the target state’s interests (Singapore was fighting communism at the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1971, Singapore revoked the licence of the Singapore Herald for spreading misinformation to work up feelings against Singapore’s compulsory military service policy, and expelled three foreign journalists working for the newspaper. One of the paper’s primary investors was Donald Stephens, then Malaysian high commissioner to Australia. This also fits the definition of an HIC because it was a coordinated action to manipulate sentiment against the target state’s interests (Singapore was building its defence force at the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Hoover Institution report, China’s Influence and American Interests: Promoting Constructive Vigilance, has observed that in 2016, when Singapore became ASEAN country coordinator, Chinese diplomats called on Singapore to manage ASEAN’s discussion on South China Sea issues, while messages began to appear on social media that appeared to ‘instil a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitability and desirability of a Chinese identity for multiracial Singapore and to get Singaporeans – and not just Chinese Singaporeans – to pressure the government to align Singapore’s national interests with China’s interests’. These messages have not been attributed to any actor, but the report notes that they ‘resemble arguments made in the Chinese media, in particular the Global Times’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already mentioned is the more recent 2018 spike in social media comments critical of Singapore at a time when neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore were in the midst of maritime and airspace disputes. The comments covered not only maritime and airspace, but also traffic jams at land checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malaysia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaysia has also alleged HICs without using the same terminology, but the circumstances are murky. This section draws on the work of Gulizar Haciyakupoglu to analyse the allegations. In 2018, the government urged foreign press to stop circulating ‘fake news’ that might damage then-prime minister Najib Razak’s campaign for the 14th general election. The news reports alleged that millions of US dollars misappropriated from deposits in 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a government-owned investment fund, had gone into Najib’s personal account. However, a subsequent post-election criminal investigation of Najib has shown that the reports may have been accurate, and not an HIC. In any event, this does not exactly fit the definition of an HIC because the news stories were public and not covert or coordinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 2018 election campaign, leading politicians accused rival party members of inviting foreign interference or receiving foreign funding or support. Without substantiation or evidence, these appear to have been attempts at discrediting rivals and deflecting from real issues, rather than actual instances of foreign interference or HICs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that there is no real threat of foreign HICs in Malaysia. The Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) found that in the same election, Twitter bots (automated inauthentic accounts used to artificially inflate numbers of engagements online and manipulate public opinion) with Cyrillic names were responsible for two hashtag campaigns, #SayNOtoPH and #KalahkanPakatan (Defeat Pakatan). DFRLab suggested that the bots were generated by Russian-speaking ‘bot herders’ on behalf of the then-ruling National Front (Barisan Nasional) party or its supporters, so it remains in question whether the malign actors ultimately responsible for the campaign were foreign or domestic. In any event, this action could fit the definition of an HIC because it was a covert action (by artificial accounts) to manipulate public sentiment, arguably against the interests of the target state (to keep an allegedly corrupt government in power).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Philippines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Facebook announced that it had removed two networks for violating its policy against ‘foreign or government interference’ that consists of ‘coordinated inauthentic behaviour’ (multiple fake accounts sharing similar information to manipulate public opinion). One of these networks originated from individuals in Fujian, China, and the other from the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first network, with 155 accounts, 11 pages, nine groups and six Instagram accounts, originated in China and focused on the Philippines and Southeast Asia. It supported Chinese naval activity in the South China Sea, then-president Rodrigo Duterte, and the potential run of Duterte’s daughter for the 2022 presidential election, and criticised Rappler, a media outlet that is a vocal opponent of the president. Graphika Labs analysed the dataset and noted that its other content reflected Chinese messaging on issues such as the Hong Kong protests, Taiwan’s independence and the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This campaign is interesting because it only spent $60 on advertising, it could not be conclusively attributed to a state actor and, importantly, it supported the ruling government and criticised its opponents. The target state would not be inclined to label this as an HIC because the action, although covert and coordinated (inauthentic accounts), was arguably not against the interests of the target state (nor the ruling government).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second network of coordinated inauthentic behaviour originated in the Philippines and focused on domestic political issues for domestic audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indonesia and Myanmar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Malaysian and Philippines examples illustrate an inconvenient reality of information operations in Southeast Asia: domestic malign actors account for most of the reported cases, and in some cases governments are accused of being the sources of domestic disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allegations of foreign interference or foreign information operations are used as election tactics to discredit rivals, or to suppress criticism of government policies and politicians, or to dismiss opposing views of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, observers have reported on ‘cyber troops’ (groups tasked with manipulating public opinion online on behalf of political parties or the government) that overlap with ideologically motivated groups and social media influencers supporting the same causes. The cyber troops’ activities include micro-targeting messages and ‘trolling’ (harassing) opponents and journalists. Both major opposing parties in the recent elections are reported to have employed ‘buzzers’ and ‘micro-celebrities’ to run multiple fake accounts to share political narratives for their respective parties. One information campaign in 2016 targeted the then governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (known as Ahok), and resulted in hundreds of thousands protesting on the streets of Jakarta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2020 Myanmar elections, politicians and the military are alleged to have spread rumours, misinformation and disinformation through social media, print media and word of mouth to target political opponents and minority groups. The extremist Ma Ba Tha movement is alleged to have used disinformation campaigns targeting the then-ruling National League for Democracy party, then-state counsellor of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi, and Rohingya/Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This came after the tragic inter-ethnic conflict in Myanmar in 2017, where the UN recognised that elements of the Myanmar army had committed genocide and ethnic cleansing against the Muslim Rohingya minority, fuelled in large part by hate speech and disinformation that had been spreading from at least 2014 to 2017 on Facebook, often through accounts and pages controlled by the Myanmar army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indonesia and Myanmar cases could be described as HICs because they were covert actions (fake accounts) or coordinated actions (pages controlled by the Myanmar army) aimed at manipulating sentiment against the interests of the target state (inciting unrest or violence against certain groups), even though the malign actor may have been the ruling government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ideological-groups&quot;&gt;Ideological Groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asian states also face information operations from malign actors who are loosely organised but share a common ideology or belief that can be dangerous when it morphs into extremism. This includes Hindu extremists, Muslim extremists and Buddhist extremists, who spread hate speech through social media, leading to lynching and other forms of violence. It also includes ‘anti-vaxxers’ spreading Covid-19 misinformation during the pandemic, which is seriously undermining public health efforts in Southeast Asian states. The prominent anti-vaxxer groups in Southeast Asia appear to be domestic and not controlled by foreign malign actors, although they draw much of their material from foreign sources. Are these groups malign actors, victims of deception, ‘useful idiots’ or some combination thereof? Did they seek out the foreign information, or was it pushed to them? If a foreign state is responsible for creating or promoting Covid-19 misinformation in the first place (as Russia and China have both been accused of), does this make the foreign state ultimately responsible as the malign actor, even if the affected state was not a direct target? All these questions merit investigation and further research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;government-countermeasures-and-reactions&quot;&gt;Government Countermeasures and Reactions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countermeasures that governments in Southeast Asia have taken against information operations include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promoting public education, digital literacy and critical thinking: Singapore has launched initiatives for students, young adults and senior citizens, such as the Better Internet Campaign (which aims to help students become responsible and ethical users of the internet) and the National Library Board’s SURE (Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate) programme (which trains individuals to identify fake news).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Passing legislation against spreading misinformation or disinformation: Singapore has passed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (POFMA), and Malaysia passed the Anti-Fake News Act, though the latter was subsequently repealed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working with social media platforms: YouTube has taken down videos containing false claims about vaccination by an anti-vaccination group based in Singapore called Healing the Divide. This action was praised by Singapore’s Ministry of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing clear communications, especially to counter falsehoods: Singapore health authorities use a multi-channel communication strategy to share Covid-19 information and policies, including press conferences by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce, print media, TV, and dedicated Telegram channels and WhatsApp groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fact-checking: The Singaporean and Malaysian governments do this with their Factually and Sebenarnya websites, respectively. The weakness of this approach is that people who believe in conspiracy theories are unlikely to believe government fact checks, and people generally may not trust fact checks that appear to be partisan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus-on-legislation-as-a-countermeasure&quot;&gt;Focus on Legislation as a Countermeasure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under POFMA, the government can issue ‘correction directions’ that require social media platforms to display correction notices to their users in Singapore, next to the information or post that is labelled as an online falsehood. Since the start of the global pandemic, Singapore has issued several correction directions under POFMA against Facebook, Twitter and media company SPH magazines over false claims about Covid-19. These corrections were generally welcomed by the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, during the 2020 general election, the authorities issued correction directions about certain comments made by opposition politicians, some of which were critical of the government. This raised fears that POFMA was being used to silence criticism of the government. One scholar suggests that POFMA could diminish public trust in this way, citing the ruling government’s diminished performance in the 2020 general election as an indication of a fall in public trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore also passed FICA in 2021, to prevent foreign entities from using HICs and local proxies (called ‘politically significant persons’ in the Act) to interfere in Singapore’s politics, including acts of foreign interference ‘by covert means using electronic communications’. The minister for law clarified in Parliament that FICA did not apply to Singaporeans acting of their own accord, foreigners who made open, attributable comments, or foreign political observers and commentators. Rather, it would cover instances where a foreign state (or its proxies) covertly offers a local politician or journalist incentives to influence what they say in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that some other Southeast Asian governments are less likely to use legislation against disinformation campaigns since Malaysia repealed its Anti-Fake News Act in 2018 and the Philippines did not pass its proposed law against fake news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, laws against disinformation or fake news are clearly being used by other Southeast Asian governments, such as Vietnam’s Cyber Security Law (which covers false information on social media) and Indonesia’s Information and Electronic Transactions Act. Prosecutions have been made in Thailand and Indonesia for allegedly spreading false information about Covid-19, and even in Malaysia, a journalist has been arrested for her social media posts on the subject. The speed of these actions and gaps in government accountability have raised fears from local critics and Western observers that Southeast Asian governments might use the pandemic as an excuse to suppress unfavourable content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;government-as-the-threat-actor&quot;&gt;Government as the Threat Actor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments in Southeast Asia have a special dilemma in responding to information operations, because they are often accused of being perpetrators in the first place, as discussed above. Existing legislation is seen as already infringing on freedom of expression, and government actions are seen as another way to suppress dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this environment, the burden has fallen on non-governmental fact-checking efforts instead, such as the Thai News Agency’s Sure and Share Center and Indonesia’s Fakta atau Hoax (Fact or Hoax) and Mafindo projects. In Myanmar, civil society organisations such Panzagar, Myanmar ICT for Development Organisation, the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network and Phandeeyar work to mitigate social media risks, running anti-hate speech campaigns and fact-checking propaganda emails. In the Philippines, the Rappler media organisation reports on the spread of government propaganda on social media, as well as misogyny, human rights violations, and corruption in government. In response, the government has accused Rappler and its editor, Nobel Prize laureate Maria Ressa, of spreading disinformation and has levied criminal charges, including a conviction for cyber libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this brief survey of information operations in Southeast Asia, it can be seen that hostile actions can be carried out by domestic entities, including political parties and even the ruling government, with no discernible support from overseas. While the impact on the public is no less negative – polarisation, mutual distrust, spread of dangerous false information – the domestic source makes countermeasures difficult, especially where the government is suspected of using such measures to stifle legitimate free speech, or where trust in government is already low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive set of countermeasures must then come from a whole-of-society effort, since Southeast Asian governments cannot provide them alone. Journalists, fact-checkers, NGOs, educators, governments, social media platforms, influential persons and ordinary citizens all have different parts to play. At the same time, however, these entities may be contesting each other for the information space or may have opposing ideas of what information is acceptable or not. It remains to be seen whether they will be able to put aside their differences and cooperate enough to counter the hostile information operations coming from malign actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Richard Javad Heydarian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Canberra announced the scrapping of its conventional submarine deal with France upon the announcement of the AUKUS (Australia–UK–US) security partnership, there was predictable outrage in Paris and, by extension, across the EU. However, arguably the most bizarre response to the AUKUS deal came from the least expected quarters. In theory, Southeast Asian countries should have welcomed the enhancement of a US-led ‘integrated deterrence’ strategy against China. ASEAN has proven largely ineffectual in constraining Chinese coercion in the South China Sea, for example, where Beijing has rapidly expanded its military and paramilitary footprint. Southeast Asian states would be beneficiaries of a more proactive Australian defence role across the Indo-Pacific, and any Australian nuclear-powered submarine would almost certainly be deployed to the South China Sea under the auspices of AUKUS in the coming decades. Yet, shortly after the AUKUS announcement, key ASEAN members turned into vocal naysayers, largely echoing Beijing’s narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The region’s largest country, Indonesia, quickly stated that it was ‘deeply concerned over the continuing arms race and power projection in the region’ without mentioning China’s rapidly expanding naval presence in the area, well into Indonesia’s waters in the North Natuna Sea. Malaysia, recently at the receiving end of Chinese harassment within its exclusive economic zones in the southern portions of the South China Sea, turned the whole affair into a test of loyalty to Beijing. Kuala Lumpur accused the AUKUS alliance of stoking tensions by ‘openly regard[ing] China as a possible enemy’. Malaysia’s defence minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, during a parliamentary inquiry, announced a surprise short working trip to Beijing in order to understand Beijing’s views on AUKUS. Vietnam and Singapore made largely oblique statements, falling short of an open endorsement. Responses from US treaty allies in the region were far from reassuring; having tilted closer to China in recent years, Thailand, for example, proved unreliable, and in the Philippines, there were contradicting messages from then-president Rodrigo Duterte and his foreign secretary, Teodoro Locsin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acrimony over AUKUS has revealed three important characteristics of Southeast Asian states. First, the episode laid bare long-simmering geopolitical fault lines in Southeast Asia amid continuing Sino-American rivalry. Regional states have very divergent threat perceptions, including what represents a ‘hostile’ foreign state actor. Most Southeast Asian countries, with the possible exceptions of Vietnam and the Philippines, do not openly describe China’s expanding military capabilities as a national security threat. Neither is Russia seen as a national security threat – in fact, Russia has become the largest arms supplier to the region amid burgeoning strategic and defence ties with not only traditional partners such as Vietnam and Myanmar, but also Indonesia, Malaysia and potentially even the Philippines. In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Singapore was the only regional state to impose sanctions on Moscow; the key regional states of Vietnam and the Philippines even expressed their commitment to maintaining robust defence ties with Moscow amid a new barrage of Western sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite frequent warnings by regional commentators, hardly a single Southeast Asian country has officially identified Russia or China as a potential source of foreign interference, including during regular elections across the region. In fact, democratic countries such as the Philippines have witnessed a rapid increase in the number of local journalists, especially those from state-affiliated media and non-mainstream outlets, as well as influencers, especially those accused of buttressing pro-government ‘troll farms’, receiving ‘training’ during official visits to Beijing or Moscow. In 2017, party-to-party cooperation also took place between the then-ruling party in the Philippines (Partido Demokratiko Pilipino – Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban)) and its counterparts in Russia and China. The party has also signed a cooperation agreement with North Korea’s Workers’ Party of Korea. Southeast Asian countries, notwithstanding their compliance with relevant UN-backed sanctions against Pyongyang, have continued engagement with North Korea despite the assassination of Kim Jong-nam in Malaysia in February 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Southeast Asian countries where religious extremism is a major concern, security experts and military officials appear to be preoccupied with the influence of US partners such as Saudi Arabia. Notwithstanding outbursts of sectarianism in neighbouring (Sunni-majority) Malaysia and Indonesia, especially against Muslim minority groups, both Southeast Asian countries have maintained largely constructive relations with Shia-majority Iran throughout the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS has revealed the reluctance of regional states to directly criticise China. No ASEAN member has dared to criticise Beijing for its recent alleged hypersonic missile tests, expanding stockpile of nuclear warheads, and growing fleet of nuclear submarines. Furthermore, AUKUS has exposed deficiencies in coherent strategic thinking, institutional strength and political conviction among key Southeast Asian states. In the Philippines, the Duterte administration struggled to form a single position, as multiple top officials adopted radically divergent positions on AUKUS. It is precisely the brittleness of governance structures across the region, with the notable exceptions of Singapore and Vietnam, that has made Southeast Asia particularly vulnerable to foreign corrosive influence and political co-optation. Winston Churchill once described Italy as the ‘soft underbelly’ of the axis powers. The same can be said about key US partners across Southeast Asia, which have openly courted warmer relations with authoritarian powers, namely China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;varieties-of-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Varieties of Vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of vulnerabilities to malign interference from external actors, Southeast Asia falls across a relatively wide spectrum. After all, regional states have differential agency in terms of insulating their core political institutions from predatory interference. Southeast Asia is a region of immense geopolitical potential and economic dynamism; it is also arguably the world’s most diverse region in terms of levels of economic development and types of government and political regimes, as well as population size and territorial expanse. The core Southeast Asian states – the ‘ASEAN-6’ countries – have consistently enjoyed relatively high rankings in various international competitiveness indices. In the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2014–2015, for instance, Singapore ranked second in the world, with Malaysia (20th), Thailand (31st), Indonesia (34th), the Philippines (52nd) and Vietnam (68th) performing relatively well among 144 countries. The ASEAN-6 were also among the more competitive nations in the Global Innovation Index 2020, where Singapore ranked eighth among 131 countries, followed by Malaysia (33rd), Vietnam (42nd), Thailand (44th) and the Philippines (50th).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This economic dynamism, however, obfuscates institutional vulnerabilities across much of the region. A cursory look at key indicators of governance reveals unaccountable governance, corruption, weak institutional checks and balances, and democratic deficit. Southeast Asian states universally rank poorly in various indices such as the Press Freedom Index, Freedom House’s Freedom in the World reports, the Democracy Index and, with the notable exception of Singapore, Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index. Not one ASEAN country is considered to be a ‘fully deepened’ democracy by experts, with Indonesia, which enjoys the region’s freest political regime, classified as a ‘flawed democracy’ in the Democracy Index and as ‘partly free’ by Freedom House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, only Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines can be classified as ‘minimalist-procedural’ democracies, given their record of relatively competitive elections in recent years. But even when a more relativistic ‘varieties of democracy’ approach is adopted, all three countries rank poorly in terms of press freedom, corruption and robustness of institutional checks and balances. In both the Philippines and Indonesia, meanwhile, patterns of authoritarian populism and patronage politics have persisted in recent years, further eroding the institutional foundations of ASEAN’s fledgling democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually and politically, the line between (legitimate) influence and malign interference is often unclear and hard to pin down. In practice, vectors of influence comprise grey-zone tactics providing plausible deniability to malign actors as well as their overseas clients. Thus, this chapter focuses in particular on what political scientist Christopher Walker has described as ‘sharp power’: a unique attribute of authoritarian superpowers, which seek to project their influence internationally, with the objectives of limiting free expression, spreading confusion and distorting the political environment within democracies. Beyond targeting fledgling and established democracies, authoritarian superpowers can deploy a variety of means – from bribery to intimidation and disinformation – to co-opt and corrode vectors of power and decision-making in target countries, including spheres of mainstream as well as social media, civil society, and the broader business community, in addition to state institutions, political figures and political parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Vulnerability to Sharp Power in ASEAN Countries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Joseph Nye argues, ‘Beijing and Moscow have spent tens of billions of dollars to shape public perceptions and behaviour around the world’ through the systematic deployment of ‘tools new and old that exploit the asymmetry of openness between their own restrictive systems and democratic societies’. In particular, sharp power can come in the form of ‘the deceptive use of information for hostile purposes’, harking back to the Cold War era of ‘manipulation of ideas, political perceptions, and electoral processes’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess vulnerability to sharp power as a form of foreign interference by overseas actors, Southeast Asian countries can be divided along two axes: vulnerability based on the level of strategic autonomy and institutional checks and balances (against corruption and co-optation); and geopolitical relevance (to foreign actors). Thus, Southeast Asian nations can be roughly classified into four types: low-to-medium geopolitical relevance with high vulnerability (Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia); high geopolitical relevance with low vulnerability (Vietnam and Singapore); medium geopolitical relevance and medium vulnerability (Thailand and Brunei); and high geopolitical relevance and medium-to-high vulnerability (Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines) (see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;asean-vulnerability-to-sharp-power-and-foreign-state-actors&quot;&gt;ASEAN Vulnerability to Sharp Power and Foreign State Actors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vulnerability to malign foreign interference, some countries are more equal than others. Regionally, Singapore has proactively pushed back against suspected interference operations by China. One big area of concern for Singapore, which has developed robust defence cooperation with the US and other major Western powers in recent years, is the potential emergence of a pro-Beijing ‘fifth column’ in the Chinese-majority city state. China set off alarm bells when its Overseas Chinese Affairs Office was incorporated into the United Front Work Department, thus raising concerns over more active efforts by Beijing to co-opt communities of Chinese descent overseas. As veteran Singaporean diplomat Bilahari Kausikan openly warned at a public conference in 2018, ‘[the] very point of [the ongoing] United Front work is to blur the distinction between the domestic and international and promote the [Chinese Communist Party (CCP)]’s interests wherever it may be, domestic or international’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officially, China maintains a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of its neighbouring countries. However, President Xi Jinping effectively contradicted that position when he began blurring the distinction between huaren (ethnic Chinese of all nationalities) and huaqiao (overseas Chinese citizens) by declaring that the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation requires the joint efforts of the Chinese sons and daughters at home and abroad. In effect, Xi has embraced 60 million huaqiao, many of whom are spread across the Southeast Asian countries of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, as demographic extensions of a greater China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a study by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Singaporean universities have had the highest level of research and academic collaboration with Chinese counterparts affiliated with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) compared to any other country in the region. Meanwhile, a study by the Jamestown Foundation has found that China has used seemingly innocuous front organisations, including business groups, for disinformation campaigns, including the narrative of a ‘greater China’, which is extremely sensitive in a city state where three-quarters of the population is of Chinese ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore has responded to sharp power and foreign interference threats in a variety of ways. Intent on reiterating its ‘Chinese’ identity distinct from that of China, the country went as far as to build the $110-million Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre, which serves as a clear rejection of Xi’s vision. It has also crafted strict regulations for social media platforms. In a national statement at the adoption of its third Universal Periodic Review in 2021, Singapore’s permanent representative to the UN Office in Geneva described such measures as a matter of national security: ‘Our concern lies with the use of coordinated, deceptive methods by hostile foreign actors to manipulate our political discourse and disrupt our society.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam has staked its legitimacy on resisting Chinese influence in addition to providing stability and economic growth, and has had a proactive approach to mitigating interference by hostile foreign actors. Vietnam has consciously tried to minimise its institutional linkages and webs of interdependence with China, including in the realm of higher education. Vietnam’s national security doctrine and its trade–industrial policy are primarily shaped by an abiding commitment to reducing dependence on and vulnerability to China. The same cannot be said about three other, highly geopolitically relevant Southeast Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia may find the stricter measures adopted by Singapore and Vietnam problematic for their own political systems. Even the historically authoritarian Malaysia, which adopted a more liberal direction following the game-changing 2018 elections, had to amend its notorious Internal Security Act in 2012. Former Malaysian prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin also promised to amend the successor Prevention of Crime Act 1959 and the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 to further reduce abuses by security officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although far from champions of democracy and press freedom, contemporary governments in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are bound to face both institutional and public resistance should they adopt strict regulation of the media landscape as do Singapore or Vietnam. All three countries also lack the nimble state security apparatus and surveillance regimes that undergird public governance in proactive Southeast Asian states such as Singapore and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are vulnerable to manipulation and corrosive influence from hostile foreign actors on multiple levels. Specifically, sharp power operations in these key Southeast Asian countries function along three vectors: social media, influencers and disinformation; corrosive capital; and leadership targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-media-influencers-and-disinformation&quot;&gt;Social Media, Influencers and Disinformation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all three countries, but especially in the Philippines, social media platforms have increasingly transmogrified into vast pools of disinformation. As Ressa warned years ago, Facebook, in particular, has rapidly turned into the unwitting enabler of authoritarian populists, far-right revisionists and conspiracy theorists, with devastating impacts on public discourse and democratic politics. Over the past five years, certain ‘bloggers’ and social media influencers, some with millions of followers, have emerged as the primary arbiters of political discourse in places such as the Philippines. Indeed, the Philippines has become a global ‘troll farm’ hub, as elements within the country’s massive business process outsourcing industry as well as advertising agencies join the lucrative trade in political disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to political co-optation and influence operations, two particularly troubling patterns have emerged. First, major influencers have become a conduit for state-backed propaganda, both domestic and foreign. During the Covid-19 pandemic, for instance, multiple high-profile influencers and bloggers began spreading and reinforcing the Chinese embassy’s talking points in the Philippines. A similar pattern has emerged with respect to other contentious issues, including China’s claims in the South China Sea and the insurrection in Hong Kong. At times, it has become difficult to distinguish between the key arguments of political bloggers, who have a very limited grasp of international law, and the narratives of senior diplomats and officials from overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, social media platforms, especially Facebook, publicly flagged up to 150 China-based accounts in 2020, which were allegedly engaged in ‘coordinated inauthentic behaviour’, including hosting fake accounts that pushed for the victory of a specific China-leaning ticket in the 2022 presidential elections in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corrosive Capital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second vector of sharp power is corrosive capital, which has a significant impact on already fragile government institutions in host countries. Unlike legitimate business, corrosive capital serves the specific geopolitical ends of hostile foreign actors. One potential conduit for foreign interference activities, therefore, is through ostensibly ‘private’ investments, especially in sectors that are highly prone to illicit activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Philippines’ Beijing-friendly former president Rodrigo Duterte, for instance, there was a boom in online Chinese-run casinos, officially known as Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs). Despite Duterte’s supposed opposition to the gambling industry, the Philippines’ licensing fees topped $150 million in 2019, with total revenues reaching $4 billion. The industry, however, is plagued by reports of institutionalised bribery, widespread tax evasion, human and drug trafficking, money laundering and even kidnapping in recent years. On multiple occasions, Duterte has rejected calls by Chinese authorities to ban the POGOs due to their association with the criminal underworld and their negative effect on anti-gambling regulations in mainland China. Since the Philippine authorities themselves admit that POGOs are notorious perpetrators of tax evasion, critics claim that top government officials are likely the personal beneficiaries of illicit transactions with the Chinese operators. The problem is even more severe in places such as Cambodia, northern regions of Laos, and Myanmar’s porous borders with China, where mainlander criminal gangs effectively run whole towns, if not sub-regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Philippines, concern over online casinos also has direct and serious national security implications. For instance, Senator Panfilo Lacson, a former general and head of the Philippine Senate Committee on National Defense and Security, has warned that, drawing on military intelligence sources, up to 3,000 members of the PLA could be embedded among Chinese POGOs as part of a large-scale ‘immersion mission’. During a shootout incident between two Chinese citizens suspected of involvement in POGOs, a PLA military ID was reportedly discovered by Philippine authorities. Senator Richard Gordon, meanwhile, has warned of ‘infiltration’ by Chinese security agencies, claiming that POGOs have been involved in suspicious transactions valuing up to $150 million, part of which may have been used to fund ‘fifth column’ operations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even former national security adviser Hermogenes Esperon and former defence secretary Delfin Lorenzana have warned of potential interference activities among Chinese POGO workers clustered around sensitive locations such as military installations, including Camp Aguinaldo, which hosts Department of National Defense offices and the Philippine Army; the Philippine National Police headquarters at Camp Crame; and the Philippine Air Force and Navy headquarters. As Lorenzana put it, ‘When you already see many people [at the POGOs], who are always there … it’s very easy for all these [Chinese] people to perhaps shift their activities to spying’, since ‘[the POGOs] are near [military facilities]’. The seamless expansion of POGOs, and their clustering around key military bases in Metro Manila, has raised concerns over either lack of proper oversight or, worse, co-optation of key agencies in charge of ensuring that the Chinese online casinos do not pose a national security threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership Targeting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third, and potentially most problematic, vector of sharp power is interference operations targeting top decision-makers, either directly or via their proxies. Traditionally, co-optation can take place through large-scale bribery, especially during elections, or kompromat (extortion through compromising material). Less well-resourced hostile foreign actors may adopt more surgical measures which directly target key decision-makers, but for wealthier hostile foreign actors, co-optation can take place through seemingly legitimate and mutually beneficial agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to China’s BRI, much has been written about the potential for ‘debt trap’ – drowning host countries in unsustainable debt amid corrupt infrastructure deals. But the potentially corrosive impact of big-ticket infrastructure projects is far more subtle and multifarious, especially in larger and more advanced Southeast Asian economies. In places such as Laos or Cambodia, for instance, China has managed to achieve decisive influence by becoming the dominant source of investments and aid by far, thus consolidating Beijing’s ability to shape the strategic policies of these smaller Southeast Asian states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Philippines and Indonesia, the picture is far more complicated. On the one hand, there is the risk of ‘pledge trap’ – luring elected leaders in key Southeast Asian countries through pledges of (rather than realised) large-scale investments, which tend to generate positive headlines at home. In the Philippines, Duterte adopted a largely obsequious position on the South China Sea disputes in exchange for (still unrealised) Chinese investment pledges. Until recently, in Indonesia, President Joko Widodo adopted strategic patience regarding maritime disputes with China and, crucially, tried to water down good governance regulations and de-fang anti-corruption agencies to expedite infrastructure development. Even more dramatic is the case of Malaysia, where former prime minister Najib Razak largely relied on large-scale Chinese capital and investments to boost the country’s finances and his flailing political career amid the massive 1MDB corruption scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hostile foreign powers can also influence host countries by cultivating strong relations with key interlocutors or officials in charge of important state agencies. Over the past few years, China has backed large economic projects in Indonesia. Some experts have noted the potential role played by key officials in facilitating these projects and greater bilateral economic ties, although others point towards greater agency and directives of government in attracting, in the case of Indonesia, foreign direct investment from a range of countries, including China. Similar questions have been raised with regard to the sudden mushrooming of Chinese private and public investment initiatives across strategic locations such as Subic, Clark, Sangley and Palawan in the Philippines – areas that are close to key naval and air-force facilities that face the contested South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alarm bells were also raised when a former top Filipino general, who would later move to Duterte’s cabinet, allowed a China Telecom-backed and equipped company, Dito Telecommunity, which is owned by Uy, to install communications infrastructure within Philippine bases. The US had earlier warned that such activities could jeopardise bilateral intelligence and defence cooperation. Ultimately, however, one of the biggest concerns in fragile democracies such as the Philippines and Indonesia is the emergence of ‘Manchurian candidates’ during vital elections, including for the presidency, thanks to the high cost of election campaigns, minimal supervision over election financing, and limited ability to monitor and deter disinformation efforts by hostile foreign powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Southeast Asian countries fall along a wide spectrum of vulnerabilities, depending on their institutional coherence, geopolitical relevance and political regimes. While all have equally been targets of malign foreign interference, some have exercised more agency and institutional resilience than others. Regional states tend to also have diverse, and at times divergent, threat perceptions regarding authoritarian superpowers. What is clear is that hostile foreign actors can and have deployed a variety of tools to exploit a wide range of vulnerabilities across key Southeast Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, any nuanced policy response, either by targeted nations or in tandem with like-minded allies and external powers, should balance comprehensiveness in addressing a full range of vulnerabilities with targeted measures. Targeted responses include timely interventions and policy countermeasures against the most nefarious vectors of malign interference by hostile foreign actors. This is an indispensable step towards enhancing the overall resilience of pivotal Southeast Asian countries, especially amid the intensified assertiveness of authoritarian powers in the Indo-Pacific. Ultimately, any long-term solution should be anchored in a systematic recognition of the agency of Southeast Asian states given their decades-long struggle for autonomy and national development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the threat of hostile interference should be addressed on four important fronts. The first is to spotlight the issue through raising public awareness, mobilising civil society groups and enhancing multilateral information sharing on malign foreign influence. In extreme cases, independent international inquiry, if not sanctions, against compromised political figures can also be considered. Second, states should pursue capacity-building efforts through providing technical assistance to and enhancing the mandate of key government agencies tasked with countering interference operations. Third, regulation plays an important role in countering political interference and should focus on tightening legislation against and lawful surveillance of foreign-backed disinformation campaigns. Finally, alternative approaches could include the establishment of bilateral, minilateral and multilateral cooperative mechanisms by like-minded international partners to reduce Southeast Asian countries’ dependence on critical infrastructure investment from malign foreign actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;malign-economic-activity-chinese-high-speed-rail-projects-in-laos-thailand-and-malaysia&quot;&gt;Malign Economic Activity: Chinese High-Speed Rail Projects in Laos, Thailand and Malaysia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ryan Clarke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malign economic activity is distinct from traditional forms of commerce, investment and capital market activity in that commercial considerations, such as project viability or investment return schedules, represent only secondary considerations. Malign economic activity often still seeks profit, but simultaneously can meet broader strategic goals or geopolitical intent to the detriment of the targeted country or organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is a significant economic actor in Southeast Asia through its BRI, with the high-speed rail projects in Laos, Thailand and Malaysia highly visible examples. While not problematic in and of themselves, these three case studies provide rich examples of how such economic investments can carry unanticipated consequences to varying extents, such as elite capture, debt structures and the opportunity to exert influence over key national transportation infrastructure or leverage it for other strategic and political ends, as well as engage in corrupt activities that weaken good governance. In very extreme cases foreign states could acquire infrastructure assets, although this has proven so far to rarely occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of Chinese infrastructure investment is complicated by the complexity of the Chinese system, in which BRI investments can be directed from the central government by provincial governments, state-owned banks, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) or even private companies. The almost ubiquitous presence of the CCP across industries and sectors in China, as well as questions of the Chinese government’s ultimate ambition for regional influence and power, means that commercial projects may carry strategic opportunities for the Chinese government or may indirectly be guided by it. Chinese SOEs are subject to the vagaries of global market competition but can ultimately serve as tools of the CCP with regard to geo-economic gambits such as the BRI or where the party deems that its geopolitical core interests are being challenged. The management of Chinese SOEs since 2012 has seen a transformation towards a ‘modern state-owned enterprise system with Chinese characteristics’, in which Party leadership is institutionalised through Party groups and Party committees who to varying extents can appoint senior management and participate in setting the company’s strategic direction. This morphing of the Party with the business also counts to a certain extent for joint ventures, particularly if it employs three or more Party members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bri-infrastructure-projects-with-strategic-intent&quot;&gt;BRI Infrastructure: Projects with Strategic Intent?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A substantial number of BRI projects are concentrated around China’s Asian periphery, especially in Southeast Asia. As a 2021 AidData study of over 13,000 BRI projects shows, some include loan structures that exceed a country’s financial ability for repayment, leading to unforeseen debt or the prospect of commercial non-viability. A March 2018 Centre for Global Development policy paper asserted that eight BRI signatory countries were at high risk of debt distress due to BRI loans and were facing debt-to-GDP ratios beyond 50%, with 40% of external debt owed to China. This is not necessarily due to Chinese government-instructed deception or ‘obfuscation traps’. Nevertheless, what appears to be a strategy of co-optation of elites through opaque means is problematic in that it carries the potential to create a politically favourable environment in which potential Chinese government interests can be more easily pursued. A further consideration to bear in mind when considering Chinese infrastructure investment is that in smaller, less developed countries, Chinese investments and aid can surpass those of other actors, affording it a more visible presence and greater political influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BRI is unique in its size (roughly $47 billion allocated, based on the most recent available data of 2020), its geographic scope (covering 138 countries) and its strategic ambition. A 2020 Council on Foreign Relations report quoted investment bank Morgan Stanley’s prediction that China’s overall BRI spending could reach $1.2–$1.3 trillion by 2027. While the exact figures remain contested, the BRI likely exceeds any competing efforts by other non-democratic states such as North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia or Russia, either in the Asia-Pacific or globally, in terms of human and material resources, capital, and market access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectivity Versus Indebtedness: The New Laos–China High-Speed Railway and Hambantota Port&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early December 2021, Laos launched a 414-km electrified high-speed railway running between the capital Vientiane and the town of Boten on the Laos–China border. Travelling to the Chinese border now takes less than four hours, compared to 15 hours by car, and costs $33 for a second-class seat. The line heads 600 km north to the capital of China’s Yunnan province, Kunming, linking the landlocked mountainous country of Laos to China’s key southwestern BRI hub. This $6-billion project (equivalent to one-third of Laos’ GDP) is backed by China as part of its BRI and is described as a lynchpin of deepening ties between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was marketed as a transformative opportunity for Laos to gain access to the Chinese market for agricultural and other exports while also developing a domestic tourism sector to accommodate Chinese travellers. Key details of the deal have not been made public, and no substantial degree of transparency is likely to be witnessed in the future. There have also been no open source discussions within Laos, in English or Laotian, regarding the overall cost-benefit ratio of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the China–Laos high-speed rail project is not a Chinese equity investment, grant or any other structure that would generate high-value jobs or the positive diffusion of benefits that are traditionally associated with CNI projects. This project’s loan structure suggests that it is deliberately designed to extract maximum financial benefit from Laos while also simultaneously undermining Vientiane’s already fragile sovereignty. While there are some differences, the China–Laos railway includes key elements from China’s now-infamous Hambantota Port project in Sri Lanka, which ultimately saw China take control after the Sri Lankan government defaulted on high-interest loans. Various studies and commentaries have debated the Sri Lankan case. Some have shown that the Sri Lankan government bears a great degree of responsibility for the loans it agreed with China and that domestic agency should be given greater consideration in the assessment of whether China is at fault for the state of Sri Lanka’s economic collapse. Ultimately, both sides likely played a part – indeed, interviews with experts in the financial sector have highlighted some problematic aspects of China’s engagement on negotiating these deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee indicated that the Chinese SOEs and funders may view the Hambantota Port as a successful deal, of which elements could be replicated in other key countries, such as in Southeast Asia. Chinese lending banks have demonstrated a high level of investment in developing least-developed countries that have found it challenging to access funding from other sources such as other governments and international capital markets, and have high structural unemployment rates. For countries like Sri Lanka and Laos, China thus offers a source of funding for infrastructure when financing cannot be accessed elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one report, the average loan from an official Chinese creditor carries an interest rate of over 4% with an average repayment period of less than 10 years, while the average of an OECD creditor carries an interest rate of on average 1% and an average repayment period of 28 years. According to one interviewee in the financial sector, the high interest rates are positioned as the ‘price’ for the Chinese developer deploying its end-to-end capabilities to the country in question, while other experts note that China is successful in demanding higher interest rates due to its willingness to take on risks that other lenders will not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond high interest loans, there are also concerns around corruption and bribery in BRI projects, owing not least to a lack of transparency in the infrastructure project agreements. Two financial industry executives interviewed made reference to seemingly corrupt business practices involving obfuscated financial incentivisation in some BRI projects, while a third financial industry executive noted preferential treatment in the formation of holding companies and other corporate vehicles. However, publicly available information remains scarce and requires further investigation. If true, such practices would be deeply problematic and further add to the concerns over the lack of transparency of BRI projects and impact on good governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are concerns that these problematic practices have been replicated in other BRI projects since, including for example in the case of Laos. According to a financial industry executive based in the region, specific state-owned banking executives were brought back in to structure and execute the railway deal. These bank personnel were advised to replicate their previously successful deal elements while also ‘learning from previous mistakes’. The concern is therefore that, given the opacity of these deals, China may have the option to exert sovereign control over the Laos–China railway and any other land- or rail-related facilities included in the final agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thailand: Failure to Replicate and Strategic Pushback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thailand was offered similar high interest rates as Laos had in 2016 for the extension of its high-speed railway from Laos to Bangkok. The Chinese terms of high interest rates, development rights along and on either side of the railway, as well as the right to work for Chinese engineers in Thailand were rejected by the State Railway of Thailand and Ministry of Finance and caused widespread offence across Thai leadership and corporate circles as they were interpreted as China viewing Thailand and Laos as undifferentiated and subservient countries to China, with then Thai Transport Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisth remarking in 2016 that ‘Thailand is not the same as Laos’. While the Thai government still maintains an interest in developing high-speed rail within Thailand and regionally, one interviewee suggested that the Thai government has begun to multi-source for potential alternative partners to avoid being too dependent on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one regionally based investigative journalist, Thailand’s search for balance could have further downstream impacts on Chinese investment projects, such as the Chinese-proposed arms manufacturing facility in Udon Thani, of which there have been few updates since its announcement in 2017, and a naval shipyard in Sattahip, both of which would be co-located with facilities that are used by US forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while Thailand is seeking to strike a balance, and choosing sides between the two major powers is not an appealing policy option, as is the case for other Southeast Asian states, Thailand has its own complicated history with the US following the 2014 coup and concerns over democratic backsliding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The China–Laos high-speed rail project has also further accelerated awareness and concerns regarding a range of activities by the CCP’s United Front in Thailand. The CCP’s United Front Work Department (UFWD), an organ directly subordinate to the CCP Central Committee, focuses its work on targeting governments, including in Southeast Asia, to exert political and economic influence and sometimes malign interference. In particular, there is now an enhanced focus on and investigation into United Front-funded Confucius Institutes in Thailand, specifically regarding why there are more of these institutes in Thailand than in the rest of Southeast Asia combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources have noted that Thailand’s US treaty ally status is what is likely driving the CCP’s strong focus and multifaceted approach in both the economic and information domains. Indeed, this could be seen as a part of a wider attempt to weaken the US hub-and-spoke alliance system in Asia, which Beijing views with suspicion as part of a US attempt to exert ‘all-round containment’ of China, as foreign minister Wang Yi has termed it, notwithstanding Thailand’s own objectives in its relationship with China and the US. Thailand could therefore present an opportunity for undue influence and interference through, for example, elite capture within a key American ally in Asia by using high-speed rail under the BRI front. 169 However, the problematic nature of China’s dealings in both Laos and Sri Lanka, combined with Beijing’s offensive offer to Thailand, appears to have undermined these efforts, at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese funds were a core component of the 1MBD scandal, as has been demonstrated over the course of the multiple investigations and successful prosecutions of a range of individuals who were involved. Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak and a select group of individuals around him had effectively bankrupted the publicly financed 1MBD national development fund through a range of corrupt activities, most of which occurred outside Malaysia. As the scale and scope of these activities expanded to a level where they could no longer be hidden, particularly when in 2015 1MDb missed a loan repayment of around US $550 million, the government of Malaysia was pressured to set up a special taskforce to investigate why and the United States Department of Justice files a civil suit in 2016. Some sources note that Najib received an offer from China to recapitalise the drained 1MDB account to cover up his previous activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In exchange for this, Najib allegedly granted Chinese SOEs privileged rights and access to a range of existing Malaysian port, energy and other infrastructure assets. Leading real-estate industry analysts noted that Chinese property developers were also given prime real estate at highly discounted rates in the southernmost Malaysian state of Johor, directly across from Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Malaysia’s parliamentary form of government and reasonably open press, information regarding these events became widespread and prompted outrage across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When confronted with these developments, Najib claimed he was misled by financial advisers. While some analysts have attributed this to his lack of perceptiveness, others question whether he felt bolstered by the alleged Chinese backing. It is noteworthy that one of the key conspirators in the 1MBD corruption scandal, Malaysian citizen Jho Low, continues to reside in China despite being wanted by the Malaysian government for questioning while also being subject to an Interpol Red Notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Najib had not counted on was former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad coming out of a long retirement to run for the post again. According to one executive interviewed, this development also represented an intelligence failure on the Chinese investors’ side, as Mahathir was assessed to be a senior adviser and retired statesman but not someone who would actively seek office again. Sources note that Mahathir’s re-election in 2018 caused distress among Malaysian and Chinese investors involved in the infrastructure deals and 1MDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese BRI-driven activity in Laos, Thailand and Malaysia indicates that Chinese actors, ranging from state-owned companies to state-owned banks, and by association the Chinese government, have leveraged BRI high-speed rail projects for economic gain through a range of corrupt and predatory activities. To a certain extent, strategic leverage appears to have been sought through elite capture in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government and affiliated SOEs are likely to pursue further BRI engagements in Malaysia, Thailand, Laos and other key Southeast Asian countries through continued pursuit of BRI projects and positive incentives, with potential negative consequences for good governance at the national level if transparency and scrutiny are lacking. However, there is also the potential for resistance, especially in countries that have electoral politics and somewhat free media and information environments. Malaysia presents a clear case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further investigation should be conducted on whether cyber operations have increased in existing target countries that have proven resistant, such as Malaysia and Thailand. This would help shine a light on whether a range of both incentives and coercive measures are used in target countries, and could indicate a more concerted state-led effort on the part of the Chinese state, and lend greater credit to the idea that some BRI projects are not simply commercial engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-findings-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Findings and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has examined the debate on influence versus malign interference in Southeast Asia and has outlined some case study examples of interference in the region that highlight the modus operandi of authoritarian regimes, particularly China, in the economic, political and information domains. It has also explored the question of whether governments in the region have implemented or strengthened risk mitigation strategies as a result of interference within their borders. This chapter highlights four broad trends that can be seen throughout the case studies and the regional overview, and offers concluding policy recommendations for the UK and its partners with regard to strengthening national resilience in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Interpretations of Malign States and Hostile Activity Differ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen throughout the various case studies, countries in Southeast Asia differ in their interpretation of what constitutes a hostile action. There is overarching agreement that interference is different from influence, which is defined as soft power. More menacing is covert interference in a state’s sovereignty and decision-making, although the extent to which actions are viewed as interference versus influence is not aligned across the region. The case studies have shown that deep links between political elites, ethnic demographics and vulnerabilities in institutional resilience through, for example, corruption, complicate how states respond to foreign actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So too are there differences on the question of which states are considered to be engaging in ‘malign’ behaviour. The geographic and demographic particularities and close bilateral partnerships of specific Southeast Asian states shape the prism through which foreign countries are viewed. This is not unsurprising or unreasonable – for European countries and close liberal democratic partners more generally, the staunch differences in foreign and domestic policy of countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea and China pose direct and indirect challenges to European perspectives of the rules-based international order and the principles upon which it is built. The geographical proximity of Russia and Iran, for example, poses a direct danger to European security in the continent’s own territory or its periphery. This distinction is not as stark in Southeast Asia. Moreover, the concept of a state with ‘malign intent’ is viewed somewhat differently, with examples focusing more on challenging behaviour than intent, due to political sensitivity around risking being seen as choosing sides in what is ultimately considered a geopolitical competition between the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geopolitical pressures that Southeast Asian states face are not identical and thus shape each country’s view of which states are viewed as malign actors in the region. While there are some concerns around Saudi Arabia and Iran, these are limited to relevant states such as Indonesia and Malaysia. As Richard Javad Heydarian notes, Russia’s status as the largest source of defence sales for certain countries may play a role in how this actor is viewed in Southeast Asia. While Chinese examples of interference exist across the region, the geopolitical and economic realities that Southeast Asian states must contend with hamper public discussion of the challenges that Beijing presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The Current Level of Analysis of Malign Interference is Low Across the Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the regional overview and case studies show, Southeast Asian open source information on interference in the economic, political and information domains is limited where foreign state activity is concerned. Often, these themes are addressed by investigative journalists, but few public studies by experts in the region itself have examined them in detail. This is despite the much stronger focus on overt interference in the region, such as in the maritime domain, around the South China Sea issue. However, even the South China Sea disputes and regional security developments, such as the announcement of AUKUS, have elicited ambivalent responses that seek to avoid directly criticising Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literature review and associated interviews as summarised in the regional overview showed four particular trends across the region: elite capture and hidden debt in Southeast Asia; online interference in election campaigns; investment in digital CNI; and Covid-19 vaccine diplomacy in selected states. However, issues of potential covert interference, such as through economic investment, elite capture or information operations, appear too sensitive to discuss publicly. This could be because of the difficulty in confirming state attribution of interference, or because of the political sensitivities of the offending and target states in question. Indeed, interviewees for this paper who have offered details on potential interference by foreign states have only spoken on the condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, some specific hubs of analysis in the region, which include the RSIS Centre of Excellence for National Security in Singapore, and in the private sector, Mandiant and Recorded Future, which have established regional centres of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Chinese Interference is Seen Across the Region in the Three Themes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this paper has sought to explore case studies of foreign interference in Southeast Asia by four distinct authoritarian regimes, the case studies have overwhelmingly featured China. This could be for a variety of reasons. One is the comparatively weaker and smaller presence of Iran, Russia and North Korea in seeking influence through interference in domestic affairs in Southeast Asia, and their priority of focusing on other regions and national security interests. It could also be, as noted earlier, that actors like Russia are not necessarily seen as nefarious actors in the region. China’s extensive engagement in Southeast Asia and desire for influence in its surrounding environment is well appreciated by countries in the region, and prominent case studies thus tend to more naturally revolve around China. Indeed, interference connected to Chinese state-linked actors was seen across the three themes under examination in this paper (information operations, political interference and economic interference).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is particularly prominent in discussions around Chinese economic investment and elite capture, which appear to go hand in hand in the case study chapters. These investments are being made along the BRI, but also in states where China may be seeking to achieve additional objectives, such as diminishing the influence of the US in treaty allies Thailand and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also some evidence of Chinese and Russian cyber operations targeting Indonesia’s presidential elections in 2019. Indeed, China’s investment in CNI such as telecommunications in the region has created a particular vulnerability, with several countries in the region facing cyber attacks and media interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Greater Countermeasures to Mitigate Risks are Required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK, Europe, the US and other like-minded partners have strengthened their risk mitigation regimes to protect critical industries, heighten investment screening regimes, and prevent foreign interference in politics and the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has not occurred to a similar extent in Southeast Asia, despite obvious strategic interests in the region from actors like China and activity taking place in the economic, political and information domains. There are notable exceptions, however – as seen in the chapter case studies, some countries in the region have responded with some mitigation efforts. These include Singapore, which introduced FICA in 2021, and Malaysia, through its focus on cyber security and various national security laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they look for opportunities for deeper engagement in and with countries in the Indo-Pacific, the UK and partners could increase engagement in the region in several ways. This paper offers the following four recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Continue Support for Local Media and Civil Society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One immediate area for engagement that has emerged from this paper, although not entirely new, is the importance of supporting local media and civil society, and the fundamental role that investigative journalism and local engagement have played in exposing elite capture and corruption, as well as covert interference in the economic and information domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the worrying trend of democratic backsliding in Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines, the limits placed on the press in other Southeast Asian countries, and China’s offer of media training to journalists in the region, this should be a continued policy priority for the UK and partners. It should include media training to aspiring journalists in the region, but as has been pointed out, any such assistance must be made transparently and should be understood to be highly sensitive in certain countries in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Offer Alternatives Where Investment is Needed in the Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area in which the UK and other partners have already highlighted the need for increased engagement is infrastructure initiatives. While this is not purported to be in response to China specifically, the language around principles of sustainable infrastructure based on high environmental standards, fair financial arrangements and transparency in project contracting underscores the concerns around Chinese investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, infrastructure investment can be a slow and complex process. Given the heightened interest in Southeast Asia, the UK and like-minded liberal democratic partners would do well to engage in joint needs assessments in consultation with governments in the region, particularly around the area of CNI. Further investment and engagement through groupings like the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, the G20 (through standard-setting), the Blue Dot Network and the EU Global Gateway should be pursued. The unwitting exposure of Western financial institutions to liabilities associated with the BRI in Southeast Asia should also be examined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Increase Information Exchange on Malign Interference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and partners inside and outside Southeast Asia should consider exchanging information with one another on malign interference to help build a better threat picture of specific vulnerabilities and trends in targeting. As this information is likely highly sensitive and to various extents classified, the UK, for example, might consider, in trusted government-to-government settings, sharing information on observable trends, rather than specific detailed accounts or attribution to specific actors. This would help reinforce the global response to the challenge of malign interference and help shed light on whether observable trends are replicated in different geographical locations and specific contexts. Given that governments are understandably reactive and malign actors are more easily able to change tactics, this would also help governments shorten response times and address vulnerabilities in a timelier manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4: Help Develop Risk Mitigation Strategies in the Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK, Europe and other partners have strengthened existing legislative regimes and crafted new ones to counter malign interference within their borders. These may not be best practice, but they represent examples that could be tailored to meet the specificities of Southeast Asian countries when it comes to legislation on cyber security, disinformation, investment screening and foreign interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific areas that are underdeveloped in Southeast Asia include cyber security and investment screening. On the latter, Southeast Asian countries have been liberalising foreign direct investment regimes since the 1990s as part of their development models. However, given increasing awareness of risk, investment screening mechanisms that protect national security (for example, on CNI, data and resources) may be required. Other reports have recommended that these be along the lines of OECD standards, even if not identical to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States regime or other regimes of developed countries. Foreign interference laws are another area that could be strengthened, with Singapore having strengthened its legislation in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and partners in the transatlantic community, as well as the Indo-Pacific, should consider sharing experiences and legislative countermeasures in Track 1 and Track 2 settings. However, the unique and distinct environments of all 10 ASEAN member states should be taken into consideration here, with an understanding that there will not be a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to countermeasures. Furthermore, as has been discussed in this paper, there is the added complexity of criticisms in Southeast Asian countries that legislation which is meant to protect national security has also been used for domestic political ends by ruling governments. Given the UK’s new Dialogue Partnership with ASEAN announced in early August 2021, and the launch of the ASEAN–UK Digital Innovation Partnership the following month, there may be an opportunity for the UK and other ASEAN partners to launch a programme of engagement focusing on best practice in mitigating malign activity and specifically hostile information campaigns in the digital space across Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK in particular could also sponsor fellowships for higher-level and executive-level training on hybrid warfare and hybrid threats or courses at institutions like the Oxford Changing Character of War Centre, the European Centre for Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, think tanks, or private sector institutions working on cyber security, whether in Europe or the Indo-Pacific. Ultimately, none of these recommendations can be employed individually; rather, they should form the arms of a multifaceted strategy of regional engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

It aimed at examining additional potential avenues to improve the UK’s ability to move from temporary sanctions-based asset freezes to permanent asset deprivation using human rights-compliant and proportionate tools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imposition of sanctions against the oligarchs which followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered an intensive policy conversation about the potential to move from temporary sanctions-based asset freezes to permanent asset confiscation, as policymakers seek to achieve two goals simultaneously:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ensuring that individuals linked to the Kremlin are held accountable for Russia’s aggression…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…and for their alleged historical corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the ultimate origins of oligarchs’ assets may lie in historical bribery, corruption and patronage, linking sanctioned assets to historical acts of corruption presents challenges that the UK’s asset recovery mechanisms have yet to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognising the limited impact of existing powers under the UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA) against more clearly evidenced corruption proceeds, and the complexities of gathering evidence to the necessary standard of proof, in 2022, research was conducted to identify possible alternative asset recovery mechanisms that would achieve permanent confiscation of such assets, without trumping due process and human-rights and rule-of-law protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this project, a series of RUSI Commentaries were published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/freeze-seize-dealing-oligarchs-assets-uk&quot;&gt;April&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/freeze-seize-creativity-and-nuance-needed&quot;&gt;June&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/freeze-seize-how-uk-can-break-deadlock-asset-recovery&quot;&gt;October&lt;/a&gt; 2022, as well as a RUSI Emerging Insights paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team also held a Virtual Roundtable on International Asset Recovery Mechanisms and the “Freeze to Seize” Dilemma with international asset recovery experts in September 2022. The roundtable aimed at examining additional potential avenues to improve the UK’s ability to move, where a suitable case presents itself, from temporary sanctions-based asset freezes to permanent asset deprivation using human rights-compliant and proportionate tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a summary of the views that the different experts shared in this regard, drawing in particular on lessons provided by existing international models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-viewpoints-from-the-roundtable-discussion&quot;&gt;Summary Viewpoints From the Roundtable Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-1-what-are-the-potential-routes-to-amend-uk-legislation-in-order-to-move-from-freeze-to-seize&quot;&gt;Question 1: What are the potential routes to amend UK legislation in order to move from “freeze” to “seize”?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewpoint 1: Amending existing civil confiscation laws is a meaningful starting point for the UK, but individual cases must be considered on a case-by-case basis given the need for proportionality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that any future model needs to include appropriate human rights safeguards, particularly surrounding Article 1, Protocol 1 (A1/P1) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects the right to property and according to which any interference must be justified as a proportionate means of pursuing a legitimate aim in the public interest, and Article 6(1), the right to a fair trial – which clashes with sanctions provisions due to the lack of independent judicial oversight of the designation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to participants, the civil confiscation route provides a sound basis for confiscating proceeds of kleptocracy. Given the expediency with which measures much be taken, it was generally agreed that amending the UK’s existing legislation for civil recovery (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/29/part/5&quot;&gt;Part 5 of POCA 2002&lt;/a&gt;), as opposed to establishing an entirely new regime, should be the focus of efforts. This also has the benefit of drawing on the significant extent to which Part 5 of POCA has been tested in the courts from an A1/P1 perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants raised the importance of being clear in legislation about the basis on which individuals are being deprived of their assets. For example, the current legislative provisions relate to assets of unlawful origin, which may not be a viable route in this context given the difficulty in obtaining evidence from overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants suggested that amendments to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/29/section/242&quot;&gt;Section 242 of POCA&lt;/a&gt; to provide a broader definition of “unlawful conduct” may be a way forward. This could include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assets obtained through political patronage; and/or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assets which may be made available to support a hostile regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an amendment may overcome challenges of lawfulness of the investigation. However, cases will need to demonstrate proportionality, which will need to be judged on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-2-can-sanctions-evasion-be-used-as-the-starting-point-for-confiscation&quot;&gt;Question 2: Can sanctions evasion be used as the starting point for confiscation?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewpoint 2: Sanctions evasion offences have limited reach given they will only capture the specific proceeds of the evasion itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants indicated that cases have indeed been brought forward in the United States against sanctioned individuals on the basis of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-oligarch-oleg-vladimirovich-deripaska-and-associates-indicted-sanctions-evasion-and&quot;&gt;sanctions evasion&lt;/a&gt;. The European Commission has also looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_7373&quot;&gt;ways to criminalise the evasion of EU sanctions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As proving underlying corruption is too challenging, the strategy should therefore be aimed at finding a criminal offence of sanctions evasion as a starting point for asset confiscation. Sanctions evasion is a relatively easy offence to prove and thus participants agreed that it provides a good practical starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants stressed that the UK should be investing in investigating sanctions evasion offences, especially through the newly established &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-takes-landmark-steps-to-further-clamp-down-on-dirty-money&quot;&gt;Combating Kleptocracy Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, given the proportionality test, a range of participants agreed that this approach is only likely to address a limited proportion of the sanctioned individual’s assets, namely the direct proceeds of the sanctions evasion, and is thus likely to be a minor solution in the “freeze to seize” debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-3-is-there-a-role-for-administrative-government-ordered-asset-forfeiture&quot;&gt;Question 3: Is there a role for administrative, government-ordered asset forfeiture?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewpoint 3: Administrative, government-issued forfeiture orders are unlikely to stand up to challenges in the courts and may risk diluting the meaning and impact of the wider sanctions regime.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable considered confiscation proceedings stemming from a sanctions designation, an example of which is provided by recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/s-14.5/index.html&quot;&gt;amendments to Canadian legislation&lt;/a&gt;. These allow for the Canadian government to directly issue an order seeking permanent asset forfeiture if it assesses that an individual presents a “grave breach of international security”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legislation has not been tested in court and the bar to be reached for making an order is not clear. Canadian legal professionals participating in the roundtable have argued that this approach is likely to face substantial challenge in the courts and may be unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of participants also agreed that this was not an appropriate approach for the UK. There was general consensus among participants at the roundtable that sanctions are a political tool that seeks behaviour change. Using them as the basis for eventual asset deprivation risks diluting their purpose and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-4-is-there-a-role-for-reverse-burden-of-proof-or-rebuttable-presumptions&quot;&gt;Question 4: Is there a role for reverse burden of proof or rebuttable presumptions?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewpoint 4: Full reverse burden offences in a range of jurisdictions have been proved human-rights compliant and may be a useful component of future UK amendments seeking to deal with the freeze to seize challenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants at the roundtable referred to a range of reverse burden/rebuttable presumption-based models, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New Zealand is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_126022/criminal-proceeds-recovery-amendment-bill&quot;&gt;discussing&lt;/a&gt; adopting full reverse burden at the point of asset freeze, which places the burden on the respondent to explain the lawful basis of any frozen property to the satisfaction of the court, otherwise there is a presumption of recoverability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2013, a law in France created a presumption of money laundering according to which “the property or income is presumed to be the direct or indirect proceeds of a crime or offence if the material, legal or financial conditions of the investment, concealment or conversion operation have no other justification than to conceal the origin or beneficial owner of such property or income” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000028285954&quot;&gt;French Criminal Code Article 324-1-1&lt;/a&gt;). Following this rebuttable presumption, the burden of proof no longer rests on the prosecution but on the defendant, who must demonstrate that the operation fulfils a licit purpose. As reported by the French &lt;a href=&quot;https://navacelle.law/the-french-supreme-court-confirms-its-position-on-the-presumption-of-money-laundering/&quot;&gt;Court of Cassation&lt;/a&gt;, applying the presumption of money laundering does not require the characterisation of the predicate offence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Illicit enrichment offences such as the ones in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legislation.wa.gov.au/legislation/statutes.nsf/main_mrtitle_231_homepage.html&quot;&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; and other mechanisms targeting unexplained wealth (e.g., in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2016/322/en&quot;&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;) generally rely on reverse burden mechanisms and have been adopted in a range of jurisdictions to good effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-5-what-about-organised-crime-based-asset-confiscation-models&quot;&gt;Question 5: What about organised crime-based asset confiscation models?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewpoint 5: Categorising kleptocracy as an organised crime may provide another avenue to overcome some of the challenges inherent in asset confiscation linked to the proceeds of kleptocracy and political patronage, by negating the need to make an express link between individual assets and specific criminality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples discussed at the roundtable include the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title18/part1/chapter96&amp;amp;edition=prelim&quot;&gt;US Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)&lt;/a&gt; model and the Italian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altalex.com/documents/codici-altalex/2014/07/24/codice-antimafia-edizione-giugno-2014&quot;&gt;Anti-Mafia Code&lt;/a&gt;, which use the organised criminality and/or societal impacts of specific groups and individuals as the starting point for confiscation proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of such approaches is that they negate the need to link individual assets to specific criminality; rather, they create a presumption that wealth obtained by the individual is the proceeds of crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge in the courts may be around the proportionality of individual cases. In Italian legislation, participants made an express link to societal harms to overcome such challenges and may offer a useful blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-6-could-confiscation-be-linked-to-national-security&quot;&gt;Question 6: Could confiscation be linked to national security?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewpoint 6: Using national security/societal danger as the basis for confiscation in isolation risks conflicts between national security and foreign policy goals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants referred to the option of models which use the status of the individual, rather than the status or provenance of the assets, as the basis for confiscation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example discussed in this regard is the Swiss &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2016/322/en&quot;&gt;Foreign Illicit Assets Act&lt;/a&gt; (FIIA), which may order an asset freeze in anticipation of initiating proceedings for the confiscation of assets if these “have been made subject to a provisional seizure order within the framework of international legal assistance proceedings in criminal matters instigated at the request of the country of origin … the country of origin is unable to satisfy the requirements for mutual legal assistance owing to the total or substantial collapse, or the impairment, of its judicial system (failure of state structures) [and] the safeguarding of Switzerland’s interests requires the freezing of the assets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, using diffuse concepts such as national security as a basis for confiscation could lead to highly politicised outcomes, unintended consequences, conflicts between prosecutors and government, and significant tensions between criminal justice and foreign policy goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-7-is-there-a-role-for-fugitive-disentitlement-provisions&quot;&gt;Question 7: Is there a role for fugitive disentitlement provisions?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewpoint 7: Fugitive disentitlement provisions may have a particular use in cases where a viable criminal case has been identified, but the offender remains overseas and/or extradition is not possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable raised the potential of mirroring US-style “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2466&quot;&gt;fugitive disentitlement provisions&lt;/a&gt;” to prevent defendants who have absconded from the jurisdiction from using the resources of the court to defend a civil case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While likely only to cover a limited number of cases, participants agreed that such provisions would provide a potentially useful additional tool within the asset confiscation arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What Next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing legislative mechanisms to facilitate the permanent confiscation of kleptocratic proceeds is a challenge that goes well beyond the UK. However, other jurisdictions’ existing asset recovery mechanisms provide some useful lessons at the legislative level that, coupled with appropriate resourcing and expertise, could lead to a refined whole-of-a-system approach to the recovery of proceeds of kleptocracy in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dealing-with-oligarchs-assets-in-the-uk&quot;&gt;Dealing with Oligarchs’ Assets in the UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maria Nizzero, 13 April 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/j9kvsh6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Having frozen the assets of Russia’s wealthy elite, seizing those assets will be far more difficult.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has seen an unprecedented response in terms of the economic retaliation rolled out against Russia. Alongside a basket of sanctions aimed at debilitating the Russian economy, Western governments have heavily targeted oligarchs’ assets, leaving no villa or superyacht untouched. However, sanctions-based asset freezes are a tool of foreign policy, and the assets cannot stay frozen in limbo forever: they must eventually be confiscated, or unfrozen. There is a risk, if Russian President Vladimir Putin demands that sanctions measures are dropped as a condition for ending hostilities, or if the oligarchs win their appeals against sanctions, that the assets will simply be unfrozen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears from UK government rhetoric that the policy intention is to find a fast solution to move from “freeze” to “seize”. However, the tools currently available under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA) make gathering the necessary evidence on oligarchs’ assets, and having it stand up in court, hard to achieve. Given this challenge, it is tempting to seek a “shortcut” fix, but in its haste, the government must be cautious not to create precedent for more draconian measures in the future. Any action the government decides to take needs to balance the policy intention that “crime shouldn’t pay” with respect for fundamental human rights and the rule of law, and be capable of standing the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;desperate-measures-for-desperate-times&quot;&gt;Desperate Measures for Desperate Times?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty regarding the outcome of the war and the drive to make an example of oligarchs, while showing that something is being done to put pressure on Russia, have led to some extreme proposals by the government, such as seizing oligarchs’ properties and using them to temporarily house Ukrainian refugees. While attractive in political terms, this approach falls short when assessed against the rule of law. Property rights and legal due process should be respected regardless of whether these individuals are oligarchs. Ignoring these principles would invite comparison with the autocracies we are supposedly standing against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these proposals are more political theatre than reality. However, they reveal a general lack of understanding of what sanctions can and cannot do. In the current crisis, sanctions have been used against those that benefit from or support the Russian government. If ministers want to deprive oligarchs of their assets, they will need to use different mechanisms to seize and confiscate them to achieve their desired outcome – mechanisms that require separate, lengthier legal proceedings, and which need to meet specific requirements regarding the nature of the assets and the way in which they were generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, recovery of oligarchs’ assets will prove to be a much harder task than simply sanctioning them, and will require appropriate tools to be available. To many, the most obvious solution is deploying the much-vaunted Unexplained Wealth Order (UWO). However, UWOs have previously fallen short and, although the Economic Crime Act has addressed some of their limitations – namely by expanding the definition of a UWO subject and placing a cap on the costs to which law enforcement could be subject should they be unsuccessful in their bid – they are still not straightforward to operationalise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the complexities presented by the use of UWOs, oligarch assets give rise to additional problems. Notably, the criminality and corruption at the root of this wealth are historical, meaning it was amassed decades ago and has been laundered into legitimate businesses so many times that, by the time the money is used to buy a house in Kensington, it is difficult to prove it was tainted in the first place. Additionally, these assets are often well-hidden behind complex structures, complicating the task of identifying the real owner for law enforcement, as recent attempted detentions of superyachts have shown. These issues, coupled with the investigative nature of UWOs – which requires a separate civil proceeding to be commenced for a recovery order and adds another step to an already lengthy process – still represent unresolved obstacles that render UWOs unlikely to meet the requirements needed for effectively dealing with kleptocratic assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-means-for-asset-recovery&quot;&gt;Alternative Means for Asset Recovery&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the challenge ahead, what alternatives exist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a first option, a full reverse burden of proof as to the origin of the assets could be introduced, modelled on examples such as the Swiss Law on Asset Recovery. Should an oligarch fail to demonstrate the lawfulness of their wealth, this tool would allow for the confiscation of frozen assets without the need to commence a separate civil proceeding – a step that has contributed to the disappointing use of UWOs so far. However, it would likely still be relatively easy for foreign kleptocrats to “prove” the legitimacy of their wealth, given the time that has elapsed since it was first “earned”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar option would be adopting an Irish model, through which property is frozen based on “belief evidence” and is subsequently forfeited if it appears to the court that a person is in possession or control of property that constitutes – directly or indirectly – proceeds of crime. Part of the success of the Irish system stems from the resourcing provided to its Criminal Assets Bureau, something the UK has not traditionally been willing to consider. This mechanism has also not traditionally dealt with cases involving politically exposed persons, bringing into question its effectiveness when applied against oligarchs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third option to consider is the concept of “criminality by association”, found in racketeering legislation in Italy and the US. In the US case, the general test is whether the defendant knew about the criminal nature of a conspiracy of which they were part, not that they agreed to a specific predicate offence. If applied to oligarchs, the key point would be proving they knew and understood the corrupt nature of the Russian regime with which they are associated, in the same way a mafia member would. For this to work, a close connection between the oligarchs and the regime needs to be established, as well as the kleptocratic nature of the Russian government. However, the latter would require the UK government to list Russia as a kleptocracy – something that is likely to be undesirable from a diplomatic standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;no-easy-answer&quot;&gt;No Easy Answer&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although current tools may prove ineffective in these unique circumstances, it may be possible for the government to develop new legislation to move from “freeze” to “seize” while respecting due process, providing the precise circumstances justifying confiscation are carefully set out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with ensuring proportionality and respect for human rights and the rule of law, policymakers should also carefully consider the primary purpose of this asset confiscation. Is it a step that is felt necessary to persuade Putin to stop waging war against Ukraine, and to disincentivise other countries (like China) from carrying out similar acts of aggression, or is it because the oligarchs’ wealth was illicitly acquired in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the latter, the line between the role of sanctions and the role of asset confiscation must not be blurred in the way it has been thus far. More importantly, any measure taken today should be designed to stand the test of time, so that it can be used in the future against criminally acquired assets from other unpalatable regimes and in support of other sanctions, such as those targeting corruption or human rights abuses. The government should aim to develop asset recovery mechanisms that are capable of targeting dirty money, whatever its origin may be. After all, the “London laundromat” was a national security issue long before the war in Ukraine, and will continue to be a threat long after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creativity-and-nuance-is-needed&quot;&gt;Creativity and Nuance is Needed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom Keatinge and Maria Nizzero, 7 June 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nnOb5d4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Political rhetoric on sanctioned Russian asset seizure is being replaced by concrete proposals. A long legal road lies ahead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine passes 100 days, and as the imposition of Western sanctions on Russia-related assets continues, the debate surrounding what to do with these frozen assets is still high on the political agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, the political rhetoric has become more moderated, and the process has entered a new stage, with the US, Canada and the EU all bringing forward proposals that are semantically different, but share the same goal: seizing Russia-related assets within the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-on-the-table-and-whats-not&quot;&gt;What’s on the Table, and What’s Not&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is currently a lively debate on the different mechanisms that might be employed to achieve the intended policy goal of seizing sanctioned assets – assets that, despite being frozen, remain the property of their original owner, be that an oligarch or the Russian Central Bank, and where a connection with criminality remains, thus far, undetermined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late April, the US opened the way, by proposing a comprehensive legislative package “to hold the Russian government and Russian oligarchs accountable for President Putin’s war against Ukraine”. The proposal considers establishing new authorities for the forfeiture of property linked to Russian kleptocracy, while setting up mechanisms that would allow the government to use the proceeds to support Ukraine. Among the most relevant elements of this package is the forfeiture of property used to facilitate the evasion of sanctions, and the inclusion of this offence in the definition of “racketeering activity” in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. The legislative package also creates a new criminal offence making it unlawful for any person to “knowingly or intentionally possess proceeds directly obtained from corrupt dealings with the Russian government”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, Canada dusted off a previous proposal aimed at allowing Canadian courts “to take the frozen assets of foreign officials whose mis-rule creates forced displacement and other humanitarian needs”. The Frozen Assets Repurposing Act, originally drafted with the primary purpose of assisting the humanitarian needs of those forcibly displaced, essentially foresees new powers to seize and sell assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs while repurposing the proceeds to rebuild Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has also followed suit, presenting in late May a new Directive on Asset Recovery and Confiscation. The proposal seeks to modernise EU rules on asset recovery through a series of measures, including an Asset Recovery and Management Office with the powers to trace and identify criminal assets, ensure that frozen property does not lose value, and enable its sale. The proposal also allows the confiscation of assets obtained from a wider set of crimes, all linked to some form of organised criminality. Like the US proposal, the directive would make sanctions evasion a crime across the EU, triggering the potential to enforce seizure procedures. This is a significant step, considering that only 12 EU member states currently treat evasion as a crime, while in 13 more it is either an administrative or a criminal offence, and two other member states only treat it as an administrative offence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, thus far, the UK has yet to make the transition from political theatre over the topic to a more informed debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;creativity-and-nuance-needed&quot;&gt;Creativity (and Nuance) Needed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These proposals include a few common themes. First, the current stance is to approach recovering the assets of oligarchs from an organised crime/racketeering standpoint, with little consideration given to securing reparations from the largest source of assets, the Central Bank of Russia. Both the US and EU packages include proposals aimed at expanding their current initiatives against organised crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, even though the EU proposal has been advertised as providing new rules aimed at confiscating sanctioned Russian assets, the full text of the proposed directive reveals that its primary target is organised crime in general, and that the Russian oligarchs are just affected by proxy. Thus, operationalising the Directive would require establishing a link between oligarch assets and organised crime. The proposed Directive has an Italian flavour. This is unsurprising as the Italian Anti-Mafia Code’s asset recovery mechanisms, albeit not perfect, have been put forward as a palatable option upon which to build tools that could help solve the puzzle of how to seize oligarchs’ assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, sanctions evasion is receiving more attention from policymakers as a possible route to seizure. In the US, existing laws related to sanctions evasion and money laundering have already been creatively deployed to seize the Tango, a yacht belonging to sanctioned oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, via civil forfeiture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final theme concerns asset return and repurposing. While still uncertain on how to effectively seize sanctioned Russian assets, the US and Canadian proposals already discuss their use once forfeited, and propose repurposing them for the reconstruction of Ukraine. This gives rise to a discussion over whom the recovered money should be returned to. The purpose of asset recovery is to return funds to victims and the country from which they were originally stolen. However, in the case of the oligarchs’ wealth, which was originally accumulated decades ago following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the “rightful” owners are, indeed, the Russian people (who might not agree with the Kremlin’s actions). While attractive and warranted, using the oligarchs’ money to help reconstruct Ukraine – rather than returning it to the original Russian victims – may not be in line with current asset recovery norms, requiring further legal exploration. A different matter would be compensating Ukraine with the money derived from penalties linked to sanctions evasion – a totally acceptable option that would achieve two goals simultaneously (ensuring that crime doesn’t pay, and that Ukraine’s reconstruction is supported).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sanctions-are-easier-said-than-done&quot;&gt;Sanctions are Easier Said Than Done&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current proposals highlight the complications of using administrative tools (sanctions) to achieve criminal justice outcomes (asset recovery). While progress is being made, and experts are becoming more optimistic about the possibility of holding Russian kleptocrats accountable, there is a long road ahead which will require careful drafting of legal frameworks that can be used should another “kleptocracy crisis” hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding the objective complexity of designing appropriate legal mechanisms, at a time when Western allies are seeking to build support for Ukraine around the world, whatever solution is brought forward is likely to invite comparison with the autocracies the West supposedly stands against. There is also a considerable risk that a court might invalidate these mechanisms under challenge, thus handing Russia a propaganda win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the current focus on seizing assets which are potentially the proceeds of historical crime from oligarchs ignores the greatest source of reparations for Ukraine, the assets of the Russian government, held primarily in the Central Bank of Russia’s frozen accounts in the West. Focusing on this dimension might yield a more profitable return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the emphasis on seizing oligarch assets is politically appealing, there is a long legal road ahead as considerable creativity will be needed to ensure that whatever results is sufficiently robust to withstand scrutiny from a range of legal, moral and human rights perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-the-uk-can-break-the-deadlock-on-asset-recovery&quot;&gt;How the UK Can Break the Deadlock on Asset Recovery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maria Nizzero, 10 October 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cGdi2tF.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the UK continues to impose sanctions, it is lagging behind allies in developing its approach to the recovery of ill-gotten assets.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of September, members of the Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs (REPO) Taskforce convened to discuss initiatives to tailor “already robust asset forfeiture tools and maximize the impact of … joint work on Russian elites”. Participants from G7 countries, plus Australia, debated legislative efforts and several proposals – including some already discussed in a previous commentary by this author – with a key focus on expanding definitions of racketeering to include sanctions evasion as well as a trigger for property forfeiture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, gone are the days of ministers posing in front of detained yachts or proposing to seize oligarchs’ villas to house Ukrainian refugees. Despite continuing to sanction individuals for their support for Russia’s aggression – the UK has so far sanctioned over 1,200 Russian individuals – and a couple of parliamentary debates on the matter, it has been months since the last attempt to freeze (and seize and confiscate) oligarch assets. This inaction is indicative of two elements: the persistent confusion among UK policymakers surrounding the ultimate goal of confiscating Russian sanctioned assets, and the inadequacy of the UK’s asset recovery frameworks when faced with this task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;time-to-refocus&quot;&gt;Time to Refocus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries in the Western alliance are grappling to develop legislation that enables asset confiscation while adhering to the rule of law, a process that has produced a number of different approaches. Sanctions evasion offences are likely to have limited reach as a starting point for asset forfeiture, given that they would only capture the specific proceeds of the evasion itself. The seizure of the yacht Amadea is a case in point. As such, this approach is likely to be only a minor solution in the “freeze to seize” debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The REPO Taskforce has made it clear that the goal of recovery initiatives should be to hold “Russian elites and their cronies” accountable “for their complicity in Putin’s illegal invasion”. In the US, this has translated into cases being brought forward on loosely related grounds, including violation of bank fraud, money laundering, and sanction statutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada has taken a different approach, where new legislation will allow the government to directly issue an Order seeking permanent asset forfeiture based on individuals who risk a “grave breach of international security”. This type of administrative, government-issued forfeiture order, however, is unlikely to stand up to challenges in the courts and may risk diluting the meaning and impact of the wider sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common thread uniting these initiatives is the attempt to bypass the stumbling block of proving the underlying corruption of the oligarchs, a process that is too challenging, slow and time-consuming. This legal creativity seeks to deliver the short-term goal of constraining the oligarchs and responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It does not, however, tackle the bigger issue of kleptocracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first commentary of this series, the author highlighted the need for policymakers to “carefully consider the primary purpose of this asset confiscation”. Without identifying such a purpose or the characteristics of the property to be confiscated, recovery efforts will be confused, disjointed and likely to fail. A choice is needed, one that the UK is yet to make: while some MPs would like confiscation efforts to tackle the UK’s dirty money problem, others firmly believe they should be linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Given the limitations highlighted above, and the threat that dirty money poses to national security, a long-sighted strategy aimed at tackling corrupt proceeds would be more advisable. However, no strategy can be brought forward until its ultimate goal is decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tweaking-the-law&quot;&gt;Tweaking the Law&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the ultimate goal of asset confiscation is clear, it is possible to look at ways to recalibrate the current legislation to include provisions that target oligarch assets. If the goal is to go after kleptocracy, it is clear that the current provisions are simply not capable of overcoming the hurdle of procuring evidence from overseas and proving the oligarchs’ underlying corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) to provide a broader definition of “unlawful conduct” may be a way forward. These could include, for instance, “assets obtained through political patronage”, or “assets which may be made available to support a hostile regime”. Full reverse burden offences have also been proved human-rights compliant in a range of jurisdictions and may be a useful component of future amendments. As explained in a previous commentary, categorising kleptocracy as organised crime may also provide another avenue to overcome some of the challenges inherent in asset confiscation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-matter-of-resources&quot;&gt;A Matter of Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intention and legislation aside, much of the inaction in the UK results from law enforcement’s ability to go after the assets in question. A recent investigation found that £700 million worth of luxury homes linked to sanctioned oligarchs have not been flagged for asset freezes. This is due not only to the ongoing role of offshore secrecy jurisdictions, but also to law enforcement’s current lack of specialism and resources to go after these assets. How is it even possible to talk about moving from freeze to seize if the assets are not frozen in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement agencies are also confronted with sanctioned individuals’ appeals. In UK courts, the first major sanctions evasion case sees a Russian billionaire requesting that two Account Freezing Orders are overturned because of the “chaotic and unprincipled approach” of the National Crime Agency (NCA). A setback in this case could seriously affect future efforts in this area, in much the same way as the Baker case did with Unexplained Wealth Orders. To obviate these challenges, the NCA needs enough time and resources to trace assets and provide evidence to bring watertight cases to court. This means ensuring a funding stream that is long-term and increasing in order to face the growing threat posed by illicit finance – something that has so far been lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;late-to-the-party--ready-to-dance&quot;&gt;Late to the Party … Ready to Dance?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is still far from being successful in freezing, seizing and confiscating the assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs, but can of course catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it is important that the UK government finally makes up its mind on the ultimate goal of asset confiscation. Granted that linking asset confiscation to the actions in Ukraine is not the recommended option, it is still possible to target hostile regimes and their associates on the basis of kleptocracy or national security interests. Secondly, once decided, changes in legislation that are meaningful and respectful of human rights and due process are needed. Lastly, resourcing and specialism need to be prioritised to tip the balance in favour of law enforcement agencies. It is now time to refocus, recalibrate and resource: only in this way will it be possible to turn sanctions-based asset freezes into asset recovery opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

In the past few years, however, Huawei and Alibaba have both faced major hurdles due to their integration in the CCP Inc. state capitalist system. Political pushback against Huawei is damaging its ability to expand internationally, while a government crackdown on China’s own tech sector is challenging Alibaba’s growth prospects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CCP Inc. in the Private Sector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond China’s borders, CCP Inc. can be thought of as the latest evolution of China’s “Going Out” state capitalist strategy to promote outbound investment. It is comprised of an international ecosystem of key state-owned and private commercial actors, state-owned financiers, government regulators, and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) organs that are connected through an increasingly complicated web of direct and indirect transactional, financial, strategic, operational, and political relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these ecosystems operate both within China’s domestic commercial space, where they have been honed to provide integral support to state development goals, and in the international commercial space, where they provide a significant boost to the reach and economic influence of a given Chinese commercial entity, especially when compared with standalone private sector competitors from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese entities within this ecosystem often enjoy a wide degree of commercial autonomy, the CCP leadership maintains significant leverage (active or latent) to steer or support firms through financial, political, and regulatory channels. Each firm tacitly understands that they will be supported in their operations where there is overlap with national strategic objectives, and that they will likely be constrained if their operations are perceived to be counterproductive to the CCP’s policy goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study will examine CCP Inc. in the private sector by focusing on two of China’s highest-profile companies: Huawei and Alibaba. Both benefited from a favorable domestic environment that helped propel them to international competitiveness. Both succeeded in expanding across the world — this study focuses specifically on Malaysia as one example, but Huawei and Alibaba are both among China’s most global companies. Then, both Huawei and Alibaba fell prey to the major internal and external risks of being tied to CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2000s and 2010s marked a period of rapid growth for both tech giants. The two titans were able to bring unlevel playing fields with them during their international expansions, thanks to the practical (financial) and political (diplomatic) safety nets delivered by the Chinese party-state. The intrinsic advantages that companies like Huawei and Alibaba could once bring to bear help explain their remarkable success in places like Malaysia, as this report argues. The ten- and five-year odysseys of Huawei and Alibaba, respectively, in that country paint a picture of what it looks like when the CCP Inc. ecosystem generates industry giants and then unleashes them abroad. Over time, their success bred more success for other Chinese tech players. Eventually, both firms became so deeply entrenched in Malaysia that Kuala Lumpur’s technological reliance on China became a story in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei and Alibaba both followed the CCP leadership’s general directional guidance for China’s firms when they expanded into Malaysia, but both also walked a commercial path and implemented their own for-profit corporate visions in the process. In so doing, they were initially able to move faster, and go farther, than the more tightly controlled state-owned enterprises (SOEs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the early 2020s, however, the narrative for both firms had changed, in part thanks to the changing reach of the CCP. Huawei’s international predominance in areas like 5G services and mobile telecommunications had been severely undermined by U.S.-led pressure campaigns — which were driven largely by the perception that Huawei is a tool of CCP interests. Meanwhile, Alibaba’s global momentum had been stymied by its own government as a part of the CCP’s crusade against its domestic internet companies. While both firms remain major players in the global tech sector, the narratives around them have shifted drastically over the past few years, due in large part to their relations with CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, Malaysia was a success story for both companies — and it may yet be again. But for now, Huawei seems to have missed out on its largest goal (building out and running the country’s 5G network), and Alibaba has been losing ground to regional rivals in e-commerce while its flagship City Brain project in Kuala Lumpur appears to have lost momentum. However, the story is no longer just about two flagship firms; there are now dozens of Chinese players extending into every element of Malaysia’s digital ecosystem. CCP Inc. has stalled to some degree in Malaysia, but many of its tech roots remain firmly in place, and Huawei and Alibaba are the two companies most responsible for growing those roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of new challenges, China’s tech footprint in Malaysia remains unmatched from both countries’ perspectives: China has not achieved such an extensive technological presence anywhere else, and no other foreign country has achieved such a large presence in Malaysia. Thus there are lessons to be learned both from the shape of the CCP Inc. presence in Malaysia in its heyday and from the challenges that severely complicated that presence during the 2020–2022 period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report will proceed in three chapters. Chapter 1 will examine CCP Inc.’s “incubation” of private sector champions, showing that both Huawei and Alibaba benefited from state financing and political support throughout their expansion both domestically and abroad. Chapter 2 will focus in on Huawei’s and Alibaba’s expansion in Malaysia, which benefited from a strong domestic base, connectivity between Chinese companies, and diplomatic support. Finally, Chapter 3 will examine blowback on Huawei and Alibaba in the late 2010s and 2020s, resulting from a combination of external pushback against China’s involvement in strategic infrastructure and an internal crackdown by the CCP on its own private sector internet champions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ccp-inc-as-an-incubator-of-national-champions&quot;&gt;CCP Inc. as an “Incubator” of National Champions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privately held Chinese companies present unique analytical challenges when examining CCP Inc. For SOEs, it is relatively easy to draw a straight line from CCP proclamations of intent and SOE behavior abroad. State financing patterns are overt, goals are explicit, specific policy obligations find their way into the performance reviews of SOE executives, and mega-initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) generate predictable call-and-response patterns for all to see. SOEs have easier access to China’s policy banks for financing, particularly those that have taken on high levels of policy responsibility. Researchers have even found that privatized companies that were once SOEs enjoy a higher level of state support in comparison to companies that were privately owned since their inception. A closer relationship with the state also extends to international projects, as SOEs may enjoy a higher degree of state support than their private counterparts. Among the private players, for whom revenue and profit are more of an existential imperative, the line from CCP proclamations to boardroom decisionmaking is less direct and visible — but the line exists, nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, both China’s SOEs and its private enterprises emerge from the same shielded, subsidized, politically guided, expectation-laden, and ultimately high-intensity crucible that is China’s domestic economy. Therein lies a fundamental parallel: long before any “national champion” firm leaves China’s shores, it has been nurtured, toughened up, ladened with resources, and positioned for dominance by China’s political-economy system. On the one hand, competition within China’s national arena can be as cutthroat and winner-take-all as anywhere else in the world. On the other, those private players that emerge victorious (and those SOEs that play their own game the best) end up with vast financial and political resources that they can bring to bear once they begin to “go out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere has this phenomenon been more evident than in the telecommunications and technology space. Two of China’s best-known tech champions, Huawei and Alibaba, form the backbone of this case study report. Both companies honed their corporate vision and perfected their competitive approach decades ago, demonstrating legitimate business acumen within China’s brutal marketplace. Both also benefited enormously from not having to compete with international rivals, follow international legal norms, or respect intellectual property rights during their nascency. Both leveraged tech-friendly domestic subsidy policies, both accumulated outsized power and influence with the help of cheerleading regulators, and both enjoyed an unlevel playing field for more than a decade after their rise to prominence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;state-support-for-huaweis-domestic-rise-and-international-expansion&quot;&gt;State Support for Huawei’s Domestic Rise and International Expansion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ren Zhengfei, a former People’s Liberation Army (PLA) engineer, founded Huawei in Shenzhen in 1988. At the time, China relied heavily on imports for its telecommunications infrastructure needs. Ren built up Huawei’s reputation (and its revenues) via a business model that centered on government procurement and leveraging his old relationships, and over time he positioned the company as China’s solution to its reliance on foreign suppliers like Lucent, Ericsson, Motorola, and others. Government subsidies poured in (see Figure 1 below and Appendix A).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Beijing’s market-access policies for foreign technology companies, Huawei eventually was able to extract enough intellectual property (IP) from its foreign competitors (legally, via forced technology transfers and joint ventures (JVs), and illegally, via reverse engineering) to become an effective manufacturer of its own switches, handsets, and 2G and 3G network equipment. Once it could produce enough lower-cost homegrown telecom products to carve out a dominant position in its own protected domestic marketplace, Huawei began to look abroad, particularly at underserved and tech-starved emerging markets. After several years of exponential growth at home — built on the back of guaranteed government contracts, many of which still exist today (see the recent multi-billion-dollar 5G award from China Mobile) — Huawei’s technical expertise matured to the point that it was able to manufacture reliable and affordable telecom products for export, at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, it was a relatively simple matter for Huawei to leverage its cost advantages, its access to favorable export financing, and its competitors’ hesitancy to carve out dominant positions in a wide swath of emerging markets where Western technology companies had only a limited presence (or in markets where those same technology companies determined they could not profitably do business). In 2012, Huawei became the largest telecommunications manufacturer in the world. It has become a company with global reach; along with its much-publicized role in international 5G networks, Huawei is a key provider of an array of digital infrastructure, from 4G networks and mobile devices to AI surveillance devices. By 2021, international revenues rose to constitute 35 percent of Huawei’s total revenue. Huawei has undeniably become a global powerhouse and developed its own sophisticated research and development (R&amp;amp;D) capabilities, so much so that it became competitive even in the most advanced markets (until recent geopolitical blowback). Meanwhile, the emerging markets that Western firms once ignored eventually became wealthy enough to be attractive, but by then Huawei was already largely entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: A Snapshot of Huawei’s State Support.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Full table included in Appendix A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evolution played out under the watchful eye of the CCP, which from the beginning has counted on Huawei — and a few others, like ZTE — to guarantee China’s ability to supply its own telecommunications infrastructure. This obligation (and burden), which Huawei has borne since the 1990s, also provided Huawei with a privileged position within China’s state financing ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a generation, Huawei — officially a private company — has received a steady stream of government support from China’s economic managers. The strength Huawei draws from this support has given it significant advantages abroad. Figure 1 provides representative examples of how different parts of the Chinese state and financial apparatus supported the company through the period of Huawei’s nascency, adolescence, and emergence as a global power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s benefits extend well beyond favorable export financing terms and a consistently green light from China Exim Bank and the China Development Bank (CDB). One prominent study suggested that Huawei saved as much as $25 billion between 2008 and 2018 just via tech-related tax incentives. In 2019, the Wall Street Journal claimed that Huawei’s total state support amounted to the equivalent of $75 billion, mainly in the form of credit facilities and tax breaks. The U.S. Department of Commerce determined in 2020 that as much as 10 percent of Huawei’s annual R&amp;amp;D is covered by Chinese government grants. In 2020, the party-state stepped in to arrange the offloading of Huawei’s Honor phone brand as a way to cushion the blow from U.S. sanctions. And finally, it could be argued that Huawei was able to offer goods and services at a 20 to 30 percent discount internationally, based solely off of the currency management policies implemented by the People’s Bank of China (PCOB) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plethora of government grants, low-cost land, and below-market lending continued to stream in Huawei’s direction throughout the late 2010s, even after the company had become internationally competitive. By then Huawei was already entrenched across much of the developing world. Although Huawei was expanding internationally as a private sector company, it thus still benefited from a state support system distinct from what market economy private sector companies enjoy. Disentangling the impact of state support from that of Huawei’s independent business acumen and position in a burgeoning new technology field is difficult. But state support certainly played a key role in building up Huawei during its early days and later supporting its international expansion — a pattern also seen in the rise and global spread of fellow private sector champion Alibaba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-quick-review-of-alibabas-nascency-and-global-emergence&quot;&gt;A Quick Review of Alibaba’s Nascency and Global Emergence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alibaba was founded in 1999 in Hangzhou by Jack Ma and a small cohort of his friends. It started as a business-to-business e-commerce marketplace but rapidly evolved into China’s answer to eBay — and eventually Amazon. Today, Alibaba is one of the world’s largest e-commerce companies, and its international subsidiaries AliExpress and Lazada have carved out competitive — and occasionally dominant — positions in various offshore e-commerce markets. Cainiao (菜鸟网络), its e-commerce-centric logistics and delivery platform, has also become prominent in various external markets, often coming hand-in-hand with operations like Lazada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this study, Alibaba’s core e-commerce competencies are only part of the story. Alibaba’s attractiveness to countries like Malaysia derives not only from the value it provides in fostering cross-border and in-market e-commerce dynamism, but also from the vast array of technology solutions offered by the full suite of Alibaba Group companies. Alibaba’s innovations at home began with electronic payments in the form of Alipay, moved quickly to a more expansive fintech vision in the form of Ant Financial, and eventually moved into cloud computing, AI, and cutting-edge “smart city” software and networking. Before the rollout of China’s new regulatory regime, Alibaba’s all-in-one digital umbrella had helped it establish a reputation for being Amazon, Microsoft, PayPal, FedEx, and TD Ameritrade all in one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government of Hangzhou municipality, where Alibaba was founded and is still headquartered, provided critical support to Alibaba in its early development. By Alibaba’s teenage years, Beijing was also subsidizing its explosive growth. Although Alibaba was a much-celebrated member of China’s cohort of new digital behemoths for many years, its status as an internet-first company — rather than a tech infrastructure company — led to somewhat less overt state support than telecommunications peers such as Huawei received. Besides its tax benefits, most of Alibaba’s friendly treatment came at the local level, rather than the national level. Nonetheless, Alibaba benefited from the same unlevel, protected, and subsidized nascency as the rest of China’s tech giants, and this home field advantage enabled the growth of Alibaba’s resources to their eventual world-leading levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yWiIhQ7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: A Snapshot of Alibaba’s State Support during Its Rise.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Full table is included in Appendix B.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, for better or for worse (from Alibaba’s perspective), the Chinese government is a significant minority owner of the firm: in 2012, a consortium led by China’s sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corporation (CIC), bought half of Yahoo’s then-40 percent ownership stake in Alibaba. Thus, in some small way, China’s own national bottom line is tied in with Alibaba’s valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Alibaba’s U.S. SEC filings have consistently reported an effective tax rate of 10 percent for the company and its subsidiaries, because Alibaba continues to be a “key software enterprise within the scope of the PRC national plan.” This tax rate is well below China’s standard corporate tax rate of 25 percent, reflecting a tax exemption benefit that the Chinese government grants to “high and new technology enterprises.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The different types of state support — preferential financing, favorable tax rates, and government-guaranteed contracts — enjoyed by Alibaba and Huawei are key to understanding how the private sector is connected to conduits of state influence in the CCP Inc. system. Before Huawei or Alibaba ever took their business abroad, they were already embedded in an ecosystem of Chinese state capitalism, which would continue to influence their behavior and success beyond China’s borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;huaweis-and-alibabas-expansion-in-malaysia&quot;&gt;Huawei’s and Alibaba’s Expansion in Malaysia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP Inc. ecosystem’s “incubation” of private sector champions helps Chinese companies to develop rapidly and cultivate a competitive edge which they can then use to expand internationally. And state support does not stop at China’s borders: CCP Inc. continues to promote private sector players through conduits of financing, diplomatic support, and connectivity between Chinese companies. The following section will examine how Huawei and Alibaba built up their businesses in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaysia is a middle-income country, with a nominal per-capita average annual income of $11,200 (or $29,000 in purchasing power parity, or PPP, terms). Malaysia ranks 62nd on the latest UN Human Development Index — somewhat lower than its global rankings for income, but ahead of every other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) country besides wealthy Singapore and Brunei. As of 2022, over 80 percent of Malaysians had access to the internet, and according to surveys, nearly 90 percent of that connected cohort had access to a smartphone. Malaysia’s technology demographics have improved by leaps and bounds over the past decade — in 2010, only 56 percent of the population was online — and today Malaysia has one of the most dynamic digital economies in Southeast Asia. The fingerprints of China’s tech firms can be found all over the background stories driving these accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s tech presence in Malaysia started similarly to its approach in many other markets: Huawei got there first. Years before Western telecom competitors would see Malaysia as an attractive market, Huawei was already there, offering lower-cost market-appropriate pricing and service options for telecommunications infrastructure. This familiar storyline would lead to a dominant position for Huawei — and, eventually, other Chinese telecom players — and open the door for wider Chinese participation in Malaysia’s broader technology space. Huawei’s quiet success via its 3G and 4G rollouts set the stage for more advanced China projects, like Alibaba’s next-level City Brain buildout in Kuala Lumpur and its related AI, cloud, and e-commerce presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s international investments, which for most of the last decade have fallen under the BRI brand, tend to center on more traditional physical infrastructure — ports, roads, rails, and energy. In Malaysia, however, technology emerged as the featured element. Even as SOE-driven real estate ventures, high-speed rail initiatives, port developments, and energy projects came and went and started and stopped again and again, China’s private tech players distinguished themselves by following through on projects and developing positive reputations among Malaysia’s consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid-2010s, Malaysia’s need for digital infrastructure and its potential as a lucrative technology market also provided an opportunity for Chinese actors to engage under the purview of a new sub-brand of the BRI: the Digital Silk Road (DSR). While DSR projects are less likely to draw substantial financial resources from China’s export-oriented policy banks, by some measures the scope of the DSR already matches that of the regular BRI. However, only 16 countries have signed formal DSR-related memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with China, meaning the vast majority of DSR projects are moving forward at the subnational and sub-diplomatic level. Moreover, while Chinese SOEs overwhelmingly serve as the vanguard in BRI-branded projects around the world, among DSR-branded projects it is China’s private players that tend to be the lead actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China, tech carried the flag in Malaysia for at least a decade, particularly as other projects faltered or were derailed by scandal — such as the massive 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) corruption fiasco that rocked Malaysian politics starting in 2015. For the CCP, this meant that tech not only reinforced China’s reputation but also served its national interests by securing a valuable international relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;huawei-leads-off-in-malaysias-tech-sector&quot;&gt;Huawei Leads Off in Malaysia’s Tech Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bolstered by CCP Inc.’s systemic incubation, protection, reinforcement, and guidance of its national champions — followed in turn by flexible yet non-negotiable outbound marching orders, like China’s original Going Out policy, and later initiatives like the BRI and DSR — Huawei went to Malaysia in much the same way it went everywhere else. It also found commercial success in much the same way as it did elsewhere. The significant difference is the extent to which Huawei seemingly opened the door for more Chinese investment in Malaysia’s technology sphere, which eventually reached a level unseen in perhaps any other market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China in Malaysia, the 2000s and the beginning of the 2010s still involved substantial investment in local energy, natural resources, manufacturing, and transportation industries — all of which was typical for China in the 2000s and earlier, both in Malaysia and everywhere else. But Huawei’s arrival in the country signaled the beginning of a different dynamic. Increasingly, technology-related business, transactions, and investments began to dot the record of China’s activities in-country. Initially it was mainly Huawei itself, but eventually others began to follow, expanding a CCP Inc. ecosystem of Chinese companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Huawei first entered Malaysia in 2001, its in-country activities began to truly scale up in 2011, when Huawei Marine was contracted to lay a 353-kilometer fiber-optic cable for Telekom Malaysia, PT XL Axiata Tbk, and PT Mora Telematika, connecting Indonesia and Malaysia. In the following decade, Huawei continued to build its footprint in Malaysia through a cascade of MOUs, investments, contracts, joint ventures, and other initiatives. In 2014, Huawei was selected to install 4G infrastructure across Malaysia. Huawei securing the contracts for, and then successfully building out, Malaysia’s 4G network changed the game going forward. Outside observers took little note at the time, but after Huawei’s 4G deal with Altel, the momentum began to build — not only for Huawei’s partnerships with Malaysia’s other aspiring 4G operators to develop, but also for additional Chinese firms like ZTE to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in 2014, Huawei signed an additional 4G deal with Malaysia’s U Mobile, and this time fellow tech giant ZTE was brought into the deal from the get-go. Shortly thereafter, ZTE would build its own commercial relationship with U Mobile. This kind of pattern would repeat itself with other Chinese firms across other digital projects, with Chinese companies often working in collaboration rather than competition. This behavior exemplifies how interconnectedness between Chinese companies in the CCP Inc. system boosts their collective market power. Rather than a unitary actor, Huawei was opening doors for other Chinese companies — including ones that could have been seen as competitors outside the collaborative ecosystem of CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Huawei setting the stage in Malaysia for several years — and, importantly, doing well — the time eventually became ripe for a new generation of China’s outbound technology players to enter the scene. Alibaba would be the leader of this next charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alibaba-goes-to-malaysia&quot;&gt;Alibaba Goes to Malaysia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Alibaba staked its claim as an economic force in Southeast Asia by acquiring a $1 billion controlling stake in Singapore-based Lazada, which at the time was one of Malaysia’s and Southeast Asia’s largest e-commerce platforms. Helped by this reputational and branding boost and driven by the commercial logic of increasing its presence to support Lazada’s expansion, Alibaba’s participation in Malaysia’s technology ecosystem grew rapidly after the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2016 and over the course of 2017, Alibaba became extremely prominent in Malaysia. Following its acquisition of Lazada, in March 2017 Alibaba announced a major e-commerce hub in collaboration with the Malaysian government, which also included deals between Ant Financial and Malaysia’s Commerce International Merchant Bankers Berhad (CIMB) and Maybank. Later in 2017, Alibaba Cloud opened a data center in Malaysia, brokered a deal to connect the first bilateral “e-hubs” between China’s Hangzhou municipal government and the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation, and aided the development of a Digital Free Trade Zone (DFTZ) in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these corporate deals, Alibaba enjoyed close political ties to the Malaysian government. In 2017, Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak visited Hangzhou meet with his “friend” Jack Ma and personally discuss the DFTZ. A pilgrimage to Hangzhou was representative of the kind of access Alibaba had with the Malaysian government at the time, and it was not a unique occurrence. Over the course of 2017 and 2018, Jack Ma met with Malaysia’s heads of state at least five times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Before the Covid-19 pandemic, Alibaba’s senior leaders regularly secured meetings and cohosted events with Malaysia’s senior political leaders, regardless of who was in power in Kuala Lumpur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese diplomats regularly advocate for China’s flagship companies abroad, including the private players. Lobbying of this sort is relatively standard practice for most countries, but China’s leaders heavily imply to their foreign counterparts that doing business with China’s technology firms is the equivalent of doing business with China itself, particularly in the context of the BRI and the DSR. The diplomatic heft that China’s SOEs carry is more well known, but the private tech players often receive similar support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that China’s private companies are often associated with the Chinese state and the CCP has created unwanted political blowback for China’s tech and internet companies in the West. In Malaysia, however, this association has been much more beneficial. Alibaba has been able to meet with Malaysian delegations many times, both under the aegis of various BRI initiatives and independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Between 2015 and 2020, the Najib regime was brought down by a corruption scandal involving the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB, a government-run economic development agency). Najib and his associates were accused of, and eventually convicted of, channeling hundreds of millions of dollars of 1MDB’s assets into personal bank accounts. Following the scandal, media and judicial investigations alleged that China attempted to rescue Najib from his problems with 1MDB in exchange for green lights on preferred BRI projects. While China was not involved in the core of the 1MDB corruption scheme, Najib’s quagmire offered Beijing an opening to curry political favor and fast-track strategically important rail and energy projects.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Najib’s successor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, defeated Najib partially on an “anti-China” platform, raged against Najib’s supposedly excessive embrace of China, and blamed Najib for putting Malaysia in China’s debt. And yet, within three months of taking power, Mahathir visited Hangzhou to assure Jack Ma that Alibaba was still welcome and that Malaysia wanted to proceed with everything previously planned in the technology space. In this case, Alibaba’s status as a private company likely insulated it from some degree of anti-China backlash. However, the CCP Inc. integration of private companies into the fold of party control is reducing the plausibility of treating private companies as separate entities from the Chinese state.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinion leaders in Malaysia have embraced the notion that transactions with Chinese tech firms are good for Malaysia-China relations, and local reporting indicates that Malaysia’s regulators can be quite purposeful in drawing these associations. One such source described a Malaysian politician seeking confirmation from his Chinese interlocutors that a particular project would be considered a part of the BRI. Another anecdote related the story of Malaysian regulators discussing the fact that Huawei had already received plenty of recent contracts and that it was time to give one to ZTE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-huawei-and-alibaba-helped-other-chinese-companies-in-malaysia&quot;&gt;How Huawei and Alibaba Helped Other Chinese Companies in Malaysia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Malaysian government seeing developmental and diplomatic benefit in opening its doors ever wider to China, Alibaba continued to charge through, and others started to follow. Huawei, Alibaba, and their peers demonstrated that they could affordably provide Malaysia’s leaders and consumers with what they wanted, and this value delivery was apparently enough to redeem a vast array of China-related cybersecurity concerns, corruption scandals, and failed or stalled infrastructure projects, and even to weather a dramatic regime change — following the 1MDB scandal — that was partially anti-China in nature. This positive association between different Chinese companies demonstrates a strength of the CCP Inc. ecosystem, as newer tech companies benefited from the reputational foundations laid by Huawei and Alibaba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this day, China’s tech companies are warmly received in Malaysia, even as the U.S.-led campaign against Huawei has achieved many of its goals. The story is no longer about two flagship firms; now there are dozens of Chinese players extending into every element of Malaysia’s digital ecosystem. CCP Inc. has stalled to some degree in Malaysia in the 2020s, but many of its tech roots remain firmly in place, and Huawei and Alibaba are the two companies most responsible for growing those roots. A fuller timeline of individual business deals can be found in Appendix C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network of tech companies in Malaysia continued expanding throughout the 2010s, from Huawei to ZTE, to Alibaba and Ant Financial, to Tencent, then to services like Alipay, WeChat Pay, and UnionPay, and eventually to less well-known Chinese tech players and services — such as Wuhan FiberHome Technologies, which signed an MOU with Malaysia’s PP Telecommunication Sdn Bhd in 2019. The dotted line between this cohort of companies is indicative of the mutually beneficial web that firms in the CCP Inc. ecosystem weave for one another in host countries. Although many of them compete on a micro level, on a macro level they open doors for each other as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alibabas-city-brain-huaweis-5g-push-and-the-pinnacle-of-china-tech-in-malaysia-20182020&quot;&gt;Alibaba’s City Brain, Huawei’s 5G Push, and the Pinnacle of China Tech in Malaysia, 2018–2020&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications firms continued to expand their prominence as Malaysia’s providers of choice for physical technology infrastructure, Alibaba began a new wave of local investment in AI, cloud computing, the internet of things (IoT), and ultimately “smart cities” via its high-profile City Brain project in Kuala Lumpur. The latter years of the 2010s show a demonstrable difference in the nature (and participants) of China’s technology ventures in Malaysia. A wider range of companies became involved — like Tencent, UnionPay, SenseTime, China Unicom, and others — and the more “advanced” nature of the projects stands out. This transition aligned perfectly with the Malaysian leadership’s publicly stated intentions to develop Malaysia’s “knowledge economy” and its call for foreign investors to help facilitate the country’s tech evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, major Chinese engineering SOEs — who had been there the whole time, struggling to make progress on more traditional port, rail, and energy projects — began couching their in-country projects in high-tech terminology to match the catchphrases of their more successful private sector peers (suddenly every factory was “smart,” and every port used “AI”). Over the course of the 2010s, China’s foreign direct investment (FDI), construction, and financing in Malaysia began to show less emphasis on old-economy priorities (manufacturing, auto, energy, etc.), and more on real estate, smart infrastructure, technology parks, payments, and e-commerce. Alibaba’s entrance was a clear pivot point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of tech- and telecom-related infrastructure contracts, MOUs, joint ventures, and multi-layered multi-partnered initiatives undertaken by China’s private enterprises in Malaysia already seemed vast prior to 2018. But after Alibaba’s City Brain project in Kuala Lumpur hit the headlines — described below — the magnitude of China’s tech endeavors hit another gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-tech-footprint-becomes-central-to-malaysias-development-strategy&quot;&gt;China’s Tech Footprint Becomes Central to Malaysia’s Development Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alibaba pioneered its City Brain AI platform in Hangzhou in 2016 and 2017. At the time, it dovetailed perfectly with the CCP’s declared national technology priorities, which in that era centered on what increasingly came to be called “smart infrastructure.” Not surprisingly, this same “smart infrastructure” concept eventually migrated into the core talking points attached to the Digital Silk Road (DSR). In its role as a leading national tech company, Alibaba could thus be seen as both carrying out CCP policy and feeding into CCP policy with its technology innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Malaysian leaders came calling to Jack Ma to inquire about ways that Malaysia (in general), and Kuala Lumpur (specifically), could leverage Alibaba’s most cutting-edge AI solutions, City Brain was an obvious choice. Not only was the platform already blessed by Chinese policymakers, it also naturally lent itself to additional collaborative infrastructure buildouts (ideally by Chinese engineering firms), and it would tie a wide array of the city’s digital ecology to Chinese suppliers and Chinese IP. Furthermore, the scale of Kuala Lumpur as a testbed and proof of concept was highly attractive to both Alibaba and China’s DSR advocates. The goal, of course, was to do this again and again around the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City Brain itself is a package of AI-driven technologies designed to help improve city management. Cloud-based networks connect with street-level visual sensors, data collection points, municipal systems, security cameras, streetlights, city vehicles, public transit, emergency response teams, GPS trackers, and so on, and work to optimize all manner of functions (traffic being the most obvious and most commonly referenced). In Hangzhou, public and private video is incorporated, as is social media and big data gleaned from personal devices. In theory, all of this is (or will be) optimized to run on 5G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Alibaba itself provides only the software platform, AI programming, cloud services, and virtual digital infrastructure, there remains a huge array of physical infrastructure — electronic or otherwise — that needs to be put in place to operationalize City Brain. It is a perfect opportunity for a multifaceted CCP Inc. ecosystem of China tech suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2018, the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) — which already had a track record of working with Alibaba — announced the City Brain project for Kuala Lumpur. It kicked off later that year with the installation of smart traffic lights at hundreds of intersections, and it eventually connected with a range of urban management systems like ambulances, emergency dispatches, and traffic control. Month-by-month progress is hard to track, but it appears that the early stages of implementation were successful, and that further functionality is meant to roll out in stages — although the pandemic seems to have slowed its progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As City Brain was capturing the imagination of the tech cognoscenti, Alibaba’s entire suite of digital solutions implanted itself in the Malaysian marketplace. Along with the ubiquity of Lazada and its logistical support from Cainiao, Ant Financial established cooperation agreements with numerous banks, Alipay appeared on smartphones, and Alibaba’s corporate cloud and AI business began integrating with Malaysia’s financial community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Huawei was trying to get out in front of a U.S.-led campaign against its 5G business by locking in its role in Malaysia’s next-gen telecom infrastructure. In February of 2019, Huawei announced an MOU with Malaysia’s Maxis Communications, centered on eventual 5G trials and “end-to-end systems and services” throughout the country. By October, Huawei and Maxis had a formal agreement on rolling out a nationwide 5G network, with Maxis as the service provider and Huawei handling the technology. By January of 2020, the two companies were planning a 5G-centric “TechCity” initiative and a joint 5G innovation lab. For Huawei, it looked as if a new cycle of deeper involvement in Malaysia was beginning, and ZTE and even state-owned China Unicom were conspicuously present as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the 2010s, China’s tech FDI in Malaysia was accelerating at a remarkable rate. Alibaba and Huawei remained the leaders, but other Chinese companies were increasingly involved in Malaysia’s tech space as well; key examples of CCP Inc. collaboration in Malaysia include projects that do not even include a direct role for Alibaba or Huawei. After the flagship companies had paved the way, other, newer Chinese firms were able to ride in on their coattails, and even SOEs started to find new opportunities. According to RWR’s IntelTrak, from which many of these project data points derive, April 2019 marked the kickoff of a mega-project that encapsulates a potentially ideal outcome for CCP Inc. abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That month, it was reported that China’s SenseTime Group and G3 Global Berhad, a Malaysian ICT company specializing in IoT and AI, were exploring a collaboration with China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC, a subsidiary of CCCC) to develop a $1 billion AI park over the next five years. The project’s goals were to promote technological developments in AI, grow Malaysia’s AI sector, and provide training to future workers at the AI park. Under the MOU, CHEC would provide infrastructure engineering and construction services, SenseTime would build an AI and supercomputing platform, and G3 would form partnerships with Malaysian government agencies, universities, and corporations in support of the park. At first, the AI park developers showed strong momentum. A few months after the agreement, SenseTime’s founder Tang Xiao’ou made Malaysian history as the first foreign national to be appointed as a board member of Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund, underscoring Malaysia’s interest in expanding technology investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nJo4vE2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: A CCP Inc. Microcosm in Malaysia.&lt;/strong&gt; SenseTime, G3 Global, and CHEC collaborate to build an AI park. Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources included in the text of the report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October of 2019, G3 secured a piece of land in Technology Park Malaysia for the new AI campus. The board of Technology Park Malaysia Corp reportedly awarded G3 the parcel of land over other applicants due to the impressive international (Chinese) names that were affiliated with their project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, however, the AI park project has made little measurable progress, and the original MOU recently expired. However, in April 2022, the original three parties (G3, SenseTime, and CHEC) reiterated their commitment to following through on their partnership. While company press releases do not specify what derailed the initial development of the AI park, it is likely that the pandemic, the long delay in cross-border investment activities, and shifting political winds all played a role. However, the partnership between SenseTime and G3 Global remains strong; in G3’s 2021 annual report, the company names SenseTime as an important partner for supporting AI initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-covid-19-pandemic-and-the-beginning-of-the-end&quot;&gt;The Covid-19 Pandemic and the Beginning of the End&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the late 2010s and the start of the 2020s, Malaysia had begun to perceive itself as a relatively technologically advanced country (especially compared to most of its neighbors). It is not a stretch to say that Malaysia owed much of this confident self-perception to the work of Chinese technology companies. Moreover, the locally and regionally produced literature and reporting suggests that many Malaysians are keenly aware of this cause and effect. By 2020, China had its hooks firmly in Malaysia’s tech space, and the hooks appeared to be mostly welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Networking among Chinese companies in Malaysia continued in 2020; for example, Tencent signed an MOU that year with China Construction Bank’s Labuan Branch in Malaysia to use Tencent Cloud sevices and WeChat Pay. However, it soon became clear that early 2020 represented a peak for both Alibaba and Huawei domestically and internationally, including specifically in Malaysia. The sum total of technology investment activities by the two companies and their Chinese technology peers — as measured by mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;amp;As), MOUs, and other announcements captured by the RWR IntelTrak database — dropped into the single digits for the 12-month period. By the end of the year, it was clear that the façade of China’s technology dominance in Malaysia was cracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-liabilities-of-ccp-inc&quot;&gt;The Liabilities of CCP Inc.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Suspicion and Internal Crackdowns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, Huawei’s and Alibaba’s business momentum have been curtailed by the same CCP Inc. ecosystem that helped cultivate their success. The story behind the different sets of challenges faced by Huawei and Alibaba provides a useful two-pronged lesson. The reversals demonstrate that China struggles to achieve its goals internationally just as much as any other major power. Moreover, the stumbles by both companies show that corporate association with, and reliance on, CCP Inc. can turn from a boon to a liability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After early 2020, Chinese activities in Malaysia essentially froze for at least two years, well into 2022. Three fundamental causes of this sudden change of fortune can be identified, and all emerged from outside of Malaysia itself. First, to be sure, was the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to an immediate suspension of person-to-person contacts and travel, as well as the suspension of — or long delays in — cross-border investment activities. China’s corporate advance in Southeast Asia was just as constrained by lockdowns and travel restrictions as every other cross-border activity. A large proportion of publicly reported announcements and activities by China’s SOEs and private enterprises in Malaysia that year centered on PPE donations, health-related collaborations, and other philanthropic or corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, two other factors more closely related to the nature of CCP Inc. itself played a more important role. The close association between private firms and Chinese government and party networks led to debilitating external blowback against many Chinese firms — and against no one more than Huawei. In Malaysia, Huawei likely lost important 5G telecom contracts due to this new sensitivity. Finally, in addition to external pressure against CCP Inc., the shifting relationship between the CCP and prominent private sector actors within China became a third factor challenging the system. In this case, it was Alibaba that became a case study on how China’s symbiotic government-to-private-sector relations can turn sour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government’s crackdown on private sector champions over the last few years indicates that the success of a company like Alibaba is no longer of chief concern to the decisionmakers in Beijing. Alibaba was not perceived to be in lockstep with the party’s ideology, and therefore its wings were clipped, despite its lofty position as China’s most well-regarded company internationally. Under the growth-oriented mentality that was once dominant among China’s top leadership, this outcome would have been unlikely, as Alibaba’s China-enhancing stature abroad would likely have given the company more political wiggle room at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei, on the other hand, has enjoyed reinvigorated state support in recent years. For such on-side private companies, there are costs and benefits attached to being politically lumped in with SOEs. While their strategic scope of operations may become more limited, the ease of doing business within approved parameters tends to increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost-benefit analysis becomes more complicated abroad, however. Excessive proximity to, and alignment with, the CCP can become a reputational stain internationally and create intractable challenges for a private company’s global ambitions. For many of China’s most prominent tech companies, the situation has become extremely delicate. Huawei is the most obvious example of CCP adjacency becoming more of a hindrance than a boon, but dozens of other private sector Chinese firms have found themselves constrained internationally for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;huawei-becomes-the-poster-child-for-international-suspicion-of-ccp-inc&quot;&gt;Huawei Becomes the Poster Child for International Suspicion of CCP Inc.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While connectivity to an ecosystem of banks, regulators, SOEs, and other Chinese state actors helped Huawei develop into a global tech powerhouse, those connections later became tripwires for Huawei’s international operations. Since the late 2000s, concern about its close ties to the Chinese government have complicated business deals and engendered suspicion from international governments — chief among them the United States. This trend has intensified in the past few years with the United States’ effective blacklisting of Huawei in 2019 and the decisions by a growing number of U.S. partners to bar Huawei from their 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through various legal and administrative mechanisms, Huawei was slowly disconnected from U.S. technology supply chains, a development that eventually crippled many of Huawei’s most prominent businesses. Arguably just as devastating was the Trump administration‘s diplomatic campaign against Huawei‘s involvement in 5G infrastructure around the world, an effort that continues under the Biden administration. The Trump administration emphasized to allies and unaligned countries that if they allowed Huawei to be a part of their 5G rollouts, they risked their relationship with the U.S. national security apparatus and their access to intelligence sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2020 and 2021, country, after country, after country, announced they would not be using Huawei for next-generation telecommunications buildouts. Some countries explicitly banned Huawei, while others moved away from the company more quietly. While the U.S. campaign of pressure and persuasion played a key role in swaying allies, it was not U.S. concerns alone that drove countries away from Huawei. Australia, for one, also harbored deep concerns about Huawei’s state ties — in fact, according to media reports, this helped sway the Trump administration toward a harder line on Huawei. Meanwhile, moves away from Huawei in European countries came amid a broader downturn in China’s relationship with Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Trump administration, the United States ratcheted up a rhetorical, regulatory, and diplomatic campaign against Huawei on the basis that Huawei technology constitutes a security risk due to the firm’s close ties to the Chinese state.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Q2 2020, Huawei shipped more smartphones than any other company in the world, exceeding Apple and Samsung’s totals for the first time ever. This would prove to be Huawei’s peak. With no access to Google’s operating systems, no way to supply its customers with many globally popular apps, and — most importantly — no way to replenish its stock of advanced U.S.-designed semiconductors, Huawei’s decline was swift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2020, Huawei spun off its largest smartphone brand, Honor, in an attempt to preserve that subsidiary’s ability to continue operating (via a deal that was itself an excellent example of CCP Inc. in action). By late 2021, Huawei was no longer in the top 10 among global smartphone producers, and the company was regularly reporting staggering quarterly losses. All told, Huawei’s revenue dropped by 28.6 percent in 2021, reversing years of steady growth (see Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/n3TT22O.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Huawei’s Annual Revenue.&lt;/strong&gt; Years of steady growth in Huawei’s annual revenue dropped off in 2021.

&lt;p&gt;Most salient for this report is Huawei’s 5G fate in Malaysia. The company had been Malaysia’s provider of choice for its 4G rollout for many years, had long-established working relationships with Malaysia’s largest mobile service providers and internet service providers, and, over the course of 2018 and 2019, had signed numerous MOUs with those same companies designating Huawei as the vendor of choice for Malaysia’s eventual 5G rollout. Nonetheless, in mid-2021 Huawei lost its bid to provide Malaysia’s new 5G telecommunications network. Kuala Lumpur chose Sweden’s Ericsson instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaysia’s political leaders offered no formal explanation as to why they spurned Huawei. Analytically, however, two obvious explanations stand out: first, the U.S. pressure campaign probably addled nerves, even in a China-friendly capital like Kuala Lumpur; and second, potential clients have likely lost faith that Huawei can maintain its status as a long-term reliable provider of cutting-edge technology services now that the company lacks access to advanced U.S. semiconductors and other related inputs. It is difficult to measure the impact of backlash against Huawei in nations that have not taken an explicit stance for or against the company. To be sure, a growing number of nations have barred the company from their networks — but at the same time, Huawei is growing its business in other international markets. Huawei faces massive challenges, but given the strong support it receives from CCP Inc., it will likely survive, maintaining its infrastructure equipment sales and pursuing initiatives like providing telecom services and manufacturing components for electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ccp-vs-alibaba&quot;&gt;The CCP vs. Alibaba&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alibaba’s political problems with China’s regulators over the past two years have also been well-documented, and in many ways the company’s fate has been far more shocking than Huawei’s. Numerous voices in the U.S. national security community had long been calling for the ostracization of Huawei, and when those voices got their wish, the results were at least somewhat predictable (although the magnitude of the success was perhaps surprising to some). For Alibaba, however, almost no one predicted the company’s twist of fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2020, Alibaba’s own government began a political, regulatory, and legislative assault on China’s private sector “platform economy” internet giants, of which Alibaba is by far the largest. Due to Alibaba’s stature — and, perhaps, due to an ill-timed contentious speech in which Alibaba founder Jack Ma criticized China’s financial system — the company quickly became the poster child for what was eventually dubbed China’s “techlash.” Beijing’s crackdown on China’s internet companies centered on anti-monopoly investigations, corruption probes, stringent new privacy and data security regulations, strict new anti-“unfair competition” rules, burdensome cybersecurity inspections, and ramped-up penalties for non-compliant financial practices.83 Alibaba at one time or another came under the microscope for almost all of these and endured wave after wave of fines and penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the U.S. assault on Huawei, China’s assault on its own digital economy champions led to an inevitable slide in business performance for the targeted companies, particularly Alibaba. By the end of 2021, Alibaba’s revenue growth and profits had cratered to historically low levels. Previously high-flying portions of its business, like advertising, suddenly flatlined. Its market valuation suffered commensurately: in October 2020 Alibaba was worth $837.84 billion, but by November 2022 that figure had fallen below $200 billion, a decline of more than three-quarters. Alibaba’s shareholders have lost nearly all of their gains since the company’s IPO in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0mbcVrq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Alibaba’s Stock Value.&lt;/strong&gt; Since its peak in September 2020, Alibaba’s stock has steadily declined in value. Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/baba/history/&quot;&gt;“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA),” Yahoo Finance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alibaba does not delineate its financial performance in individual foreign markets in its quarterly or annual reports, so there is no way to be certain how much its struggles at home have impacted its business in Malaysia. However, from a qualitative perspective, open-source media chatter on Alibaba’s investment activities in Malaysia has dropped off considerably, as have discussions about expanding the company’s much-vaunted City Brain project in Kuala Lumpur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the technocrats in China enacting this assault on Alibaba’s business model are for the most part members of the bureaucracy, the driver of the initiative was certainly the CCP itself. Movements of this magnitude, and decisions of this much consequence, can only arise from the top. And once the decision is made to shift gears on a governance concept — in this case, the decision to unwind and reconstitute the previous approach to developing the domestic internet economy — the entire legal-governmental apparatus falls into lockstep. For Alibaba, the very same CCP-centric ecosystem that had succored, built up, and unleashed the company upon the world became a suffocating burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ccp-inc-as-political-risk&quot;&gt;CCP Inc. as Political Risk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new dual-pronged threat (external pressure and internal pressure) does not bode well for China’s next generation of technology stars or its current roster of platform economy heavy hitters. With Washington and its allies increasingly hostile to China’s telecommunications companies and device manufacturers, alongside Beijing’s enduring disapproval of China’s e-commerce, social networking, gaming, and digital service providers, it is hard to envision another Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent, or ByteDance emerging on an international scale. Had the CCP not initiated its techlash, Meituan might have become as consequential in Southeast Asia as Alibaba by now, and DiDi might have had a chance to compete with Uber around the world. At the moment, both of these outcomes seem extremely far off, if not entirely precluded. Similarly, companies like SMIC, SenseTime, and Hikvision might be destined to go the way of Huawei, thanks to their close association with the CCP in the eyes of Western capitals. The Biden administration’s October 2022 semiconductor export restrictions underline that in the United States, political will to target China’s strategic technology capabilities is bipartisan and enduring across administrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party’s regulatory assault on its platform economy giants will eventually end — but it is unclear how strong the companies will be that manage to rebound from the storm. The existing mega-players are much weakened, and even though they will likely once again be encouraged by Beijing to expand abroad, the resources they will be able to bring to bear in foreign markets will likely be much reduced. Presumably, the party will one day look to these firms to reintegrate with CCP Inc. abroad, but only time will tell the extent to which they will be able to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For good or ill, the CCP and its political-economy systems remain at the core of the story for companies like Huawei and Alibaba, both at home and abroad in places like Malaysia. Both those companies are, and will forever be, enmeshed in a network of politicized interests, benefits, and constraints that will continuously have outsized influence on their successes or failures over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Make of China’s Tech Story in Malaysia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China’s technology players in a country like Malaysia, the party-state sets the direction, provides starting-gate advantages, and, where possible, uses diplomatic leverage to open doors, but companies like Huawei and Alibaba still need to succeed in the host country on their own merits. If and when they succeed, the floodgates open for the rest of China’s players, and the full CCP Inc. ecosystem of mutual reinforcement kicks into gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these political interlinkages, it is important to acknowledge the fundamentally commercial nature of most of China’s tech investments in places like Malaysia. Companies like Huawei and Alibaba arrived years ago with huge advantages derived from their subsidized home front, but they also arrived with the intention to make money, and neither firm would likely have stuck around if business were bad — nor would they have been welcome if their goods and services failed to serve Malaysia’s consumers and national interests. As for Beijing, the lines between “commercial” and “strategic” success abroad have become blurred, and the concepts now often dovetail within the CCP’s more modernized authoritarian ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to assess how much of China’s tech presence in Malaysia came about because of the urgings of the party-state and how much arose from the individual firms’ rational business strategies. One could reasonably make the case that both Huawei and Alibaba would have gone to Malaysia even had the CCP never sent out the pro-expansion signal nor offered so many layers of assistance. The leaders of Huawei and Alibaba are astute businessmen who understood early on that their technical capabilities and experience were readily transferable to new markets such as Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These arguments are valid, but they are perhaps no longer salient. China’s private sector technology companies have found success abroad because of both their home country’s party-state ecosystem and their own commercial imperatives and abilities. Whether one element or the other deserves the most credit is not the most important question; the issue is rather the extent to which this outcome matters. How should Western companies and policymakers think about and respond to this type of success? Is the Huawei treatment the correct and justifiable approach? Is it excessive? Is it not enough? Should more private sector Chinese companies be saddled with similar constraints? What might be the consequences if they are not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s Malaysia model from the 2010s is still intact, and it could be revived. One needs look no further than the statement in April 2022 that the original three parties to the AI campus within Technology Park Malaysia (G3, SenseTime, and CHEC) were renewing their commitment to the project and their partnership. Such arrangements have the potential to serve as a template for other countries as the DSR regains momentum. Arguably, a similar process is already underway in places like Indonesia, Ethiopia, and to some extent even Russia (a process that may pause due the threat of sanctions over Ukraine, but which will likely ramp up considerably once the war is over). U.S., European, and Japanese competitors of Huawei, Alibaba, ZTE, Tencent, and the rest can expect to find a similar network of CCP Inc. players in every nonaligned emerging market in the world, save perhaps India’s. The case study of Huawei and Alibaba in Malaysia provides useful insight for understanding future CCP Inc. business expansion into international markets — as well as the critical internal and external challenges facing members of the CCP Inc. ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

Legacy arms control tools had little utility as Russia eschewed arms control agreements and transparency-based risk reduction measures.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Russian aggression has included direct and indirect nuclear threats, such as Russian president Vladimir Putin’s statement on September 21, 2022: “They [NATO] have even resorted to the nuclear blackmail. . . . I would like to remind those who make such statements regarding Russia that our country has different types of weapons as well.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is forcing a reckoning for the arms control community on the utility of arms control and risk reduction tools, many of which are designed to lower the chances of inadvertent escalation, in the face of an actor who intentionally escalates crises and uses nuclear weapons for coercion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reckoning comes as the United States also wrestles with how to deter two peer competitors, given China’s growing strategic arsenal and regional ambitions. In 2020, U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) commander Admiral Charles Richard stated, “We are on a trajectory for the first time in our nation’s history to face two peer nuclear-capable competitors who have to be deterred differently, and we’re working very hard to meet that challenge.” And the 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy outlines the need to compete with China as a pacing challenge while accounting for the acute threat from Russia. If arms control is to have a future, it will have to work in tandem with these changing deterrence requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, the Project on Nuclear Issues published a study, Integrated Arms Control in an Era of Strategic Competition, that offered a vision for the future of arms control evolving in parallel with integrated deterrence. Integrated arms control may go beyond the rigid structures that have shaped legacy U.S.-Russia arms control agreements by adopting new modalities, incorporating new systems, and including new actors. This policy paper applies the principles of integrated arms control to the changing deterrence landscape and argues that because arms control and deterrence work hand in hand, future U.S. arms control efforts will have to adapt to the changing strategic necessity of deterring two peer competitors. However, arms control remains a path worth pursuing because of its benefits to strategic stability, risk reduction, transparency, and predictability. How the United States and arms control partners apply these principles will be determined by a variety of factors, including the outcome of the war in Ukraine and U.S. decisions about force posture. To be clear, prospects for arms control in the short term are not a cause for optimism; rather, this paper is intended as a first step in identifying the key questions that will determine the role of arms control while deterring two peer competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper will first examine ways that the war in Ukraine may impact prospects for arms control, then pose first-order questions about future U.S. arms control policy. In so doing, it assumes Russia will remain a peer strategic competitor with a sizeable nuclear arsenal. Even if Russia emerges from the Ukraine crisis with significantly depleted conventional forces, its nuclear arsenal will be of even greater importance. The paper also assumes that China will continue on its current trajectory of expanding its strategic arsenal. It concludes that balancing integrated arms control and integrated deterrence in the face of two peer competitors should focus on five priorities: 1) tailoring arms control to match deterrence requirements; 2) developing short-term risk reduction measures; 3) furthering allies’ strategic priorities; 4) continuing U.S. strategic modernization; and 5) competing in emerging technologies while also exploring arms control opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-the-war-in-ukraine-for-arms-control&quot;&gt;Implications of the War in Ukraine for Arms Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, threatened to undermine not only European security and the wider international order but also the practice of arms control. The war in Ukraine has seen conventional forces deployed on a scale unprecedented since the collapse of the Soviet Union, prompted fears of nuclear and chemical weapons use, and poisoned prospects for dialogue on reducing or limiting nuclear weapons in the near term. Russia’s activities in Ukraine have already proven to be damaging to international arms control and disarmament efforts, driving Moscow’s decision to block consensus at the 2022 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference. Russian diplomats objected to the inclusion of language in the final document expressing concern about operations and security at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, arguing it was designed “to settle scores with Russia by raising issues that are not directly related to the treaty.” Although arms control has been under strain for at least a decade, the war in Ukraine has highlighted its limits in preventing intentional aggression and escalation. At the same time, arms control has made Russia’s military buildup over the years more transparent and predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding, it is worth recalling what arms control is and what it is not. In their classic volume Strategy and Arms Control, Thomas Schelling and Morton Halperin defined arms control as “all the forms of military cooperation between potential enemies in the interest of reducing the likelihood of war, its scope and violence if it occurs, and the political and economic costs of being prepared for it.” As they described, competition and cooperation can coexist in arms control agreements. Arms control efforts do not necessarily entail disarmament or arms reductions; indeed, as Schelling and Halperin noted, “Any agreement that reduced the capability for destruction in general war might make war more likely, in that the costs and risks in initiating it would not appear as great.” Arms control is a tool for managing — rather than eliminating — competition and armaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrated arms control is a twenty-first-century tool that can be used while balancing competition and cooperation. It offers an approach that is more flexible than many historical arms control mechanisms and can include a diversity of actors, verification tools, and formats, ranging from bilateral treaties to informal multilateral risk reduction efforts. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tested the utility of arms control and raises difficult questions about prospects for future cooperation. Although the war continues at the time of writing, a series of lessons learned can still be hypothesized regarding what the war will mean for arms control going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;First, the war in Ukraine has demonstrated the limits of arms control and risk reduction tools focused primarily on avoiding misperception or inadvertent escalation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Most historical arms control efforts centered on crisis stability and arms race stability, with an underlying assumption that crisis escalation would be due to misperception, inadvertency, or accident. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was not an accident. It was not due to misperception of Ukrainian, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO), or U.S. interests in the sense originally envisioned by most arms control theorists — although Putin may have overestimated his own military capabilities, misjudged Ukraine’s resolve, and underestimated NATO’s unity. The invasion cannot be blamed on a lack of crisis communication channels. The war in Ukraine was not a failure of existing risk reduction measures. Rather, most arms control tools were not matched to the nature of the Russian threat and intentional escalation. Presently, Russian and Chinese strategies for competition with the United States involve manipulation of risk underpinned by a growing reliance on nuclear weapons for coercion during a crisis. They do not want to reduce risks in certain scenarios. Combined with increasingly complex and integrated conventional and nuclear systems, these emerging adversary strategies will move future crises further from the Cold War–era escalation ladder and warrant a reassessment of the U.S. crisis management and arms control tool kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second, Russian noncompliance with treaties and arms control norms is indicative of a broader aggressive turn in its strategic posture and intentions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Russia has consistently violated arms control obligations, including its 2007 suspension of the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE), violation of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and rollback of Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) programs. Additionally, it has used chemical agents as tools of assassination and continued to support the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria despite its use of chemical agents in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Moscow has drawn down participation in numerous cooperative risk reduction activities, decreased decisionmaking transparency, and backstopped its actions with nuclear threats. These data points reflect a wider trend of Russia attempting to remake the international order. In this case, arms control has served as a canary in the coal mine to the Kremlin’s broader strategic intentions; while many of these agreements may now be moot, they point to an enduring value of arms control for adding transparency and predictability to an otherwise opaque and ambiguous actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third, nuclear weapons are of increasing strategic value to ambitious autocrats hoping to pursue opportunistic aggression and risk manipulation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Putin has relied on nuclear weapons throughout the Ukraine crisis for both implicit and explicit bullying, announcing on February 27, 2022, “orders to the defense minister and chief of General Staff to introduce a special combat duty regime in the Russian army’s deference [deterrence] forces.” The reference in the September 21 speech to “existential” risks to Russia — and the alleged threat of Ukraine invading Russian territory — is a direct link to Russian strategic doctrine. Russian policy holds that nuclear weapons may be employed to counter “aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy.” It should be assumed that China is closely watching how Putin uses nuclear threats in Ukraine. Adversary escalation strategies rest on the assumption that they have several asymmetric advantages relative to the United States in stakes, geography, and authoritarian decisionmaking structure that would allow them to credibly threaten escalation in limited wars to the point of deterring U.S. activity in the region. Russia has attempted to leverage these asymmetries in Ukraine, along with integrating military and nonmilitary tools across phases of conflict, albeit with limited success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally, rising tensions with China during the war in Ukraine may be a harbinger of future challenges for the United States in deterring two peer competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; For the United States, nuclear deterrence has typically been a two-party game, and while some attention has historically been paid to the potential for China to become a nuclear competitor, this possibility has been comparatively limited until the past decade. The recent quantitative and qualitative expansion of Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals has already offered a preview of future competition. In the midst of the Ukraine war, China has for the first time conducted live-fire exercises in areas Taiwan claims as its own territorial waters, demarcating six training areas that encircled the island for four days. Future nuclear arms control between major powers will have to address multiple actors and domains. Traditional arms control tools, including treaties, may struggle to incorporate and verify any limits on strategic systems. Additionally, arms control with only one competitor could create an opportunity for the other to pursue strategic superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Arms control has served as a canary in the coal mine to the Kremlin’s broader strategic intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;integrated-arms-control-and-two-peer-competitors&quot;&gt;Integrated Arms Control and Two Peer Competitors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy outlined five principles for integrated deterrence, offering a vision that leverages all the tools of national power to deter adversaries through integration across domains, regions, the continuum of conflict, the U.S. government, and allies. As the United States moves toward a strategy of integrated deterrence, so too should it pursue a strategy of integrated arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the new challenges of an uncertain and rapidly changing strategic environment, the fundamental role of arms control as a complementary tool to deterrence has not changed. Indeed, the lessons learned from Ukraine should be to return to the first principles of arms control: negotiating agreements between competitors that can avoid war and escalation, balancing competition and cooperation, and flexibly adapting to a changing technological and geopolitical landscape. The increasingly complex and integrated conventional and nuclear systems at the core of Russian and Chinese strategy demand equally integrated strategies for deterrence and arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, the U.S. interagency and its allies and partners should address first-order questions about whether arms control is in the national interest. The future of arms control will depend on the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why would the United States want arms control with Russia or China?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What should be the focus of arms control efforts with Russia and China: crisis management, arms racing, or nuclear or nonnuclear capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who should be the focus of U.S. strategic arms control efforts: Russia, China, or both simultaneously?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When should the United States engage Russia and China in arms control?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can the United States incentivize Russia and China to join arms control efforts while also strengthening deterrence?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring each of these questions in turn can help identify arms control opportunities for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As the United States moves toward a strategy of integrated deterrence, so too should it pursue a strategy of integrated arms control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt; would arms control with Russia or China be in the U.S. national interest? The 2022 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) lists the goals of arms control as “greater transparency and predictability, enhanced stability, reduced reliance on nuclear weapons and, ultimately, a world without nuclear weapons.” Historically the “why” behind arms control was a bit simpler: to avoid nuclear war. Strategic stability was a conceptual tool for ensuring a survivable second strike, which arguably would deter any nuclear escalation and war. On a practical level, it may be in the United States’ interest to set limits on Russian tactical nuclear weapons or China’s growing strategic arsenal, but decisionmakers should first reflect on the underlying reasons to pursue cooperation. U.S. arms control efforts should begin with a “why” that drives any subsequent agreements, whether it is to avoid nuclear war, strengthen strategic stability, or reduce risks of escalation. Of course, both Moscow and Beijing would demand something in exchange for any U.S. arms control efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; should be the focus of arms control efforts with Russia and China: crisis management, arms racing, or nuclear or nonnuclear capabilities? Perhaps a harder question is what would the United States give up in exchange for any limits on Russian or Chinese systems? Russia and China have been continuously modernizing their strategic arsenals both quantitatively and qualitatively, whereas the United States is just now replacing all three legs of the triad. In blunt terms, there is not much “fat to trim” in the current U.S. nuclear arsenal if it also hopes to deter two peer competitors. What, therefore, could the United States offer Russia and China, and what would Washington want in return? The answers to these questions will ultimately depend on U.S. decisions about using force posture to deter two peer competitors. Force posture and sizing have historically driven strategic arms control agreements, not the other way around. But more informal arms control efforts, such as risk reduction measures or crisis communication, are not as directly tied to force posture and could be pursued independently, drawing on lessons learned from the war in Ukraine to avoid escalation in future crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who&lt;/strong&gt; should be the focus of U.S. strategic arms control efforts: Russia, China, or both simultaneously? A fundamental question for deterring two peer competitors is whether they are acting in concert or independently. The answer to this question might also change over time and the continuum of conflict, with adversaries cooperating during peacetime but splitting during a crisis or vice versa. An essential component of integrated deterrence is tailoring the multitude of deterrence tools to an adversary. Integrated arms control will also need to be tailored to two peer competitors; parallel bilateral agreements — each with its own format, timelines, and objectives — may be better suited for this. While a trilateral, legally binding, nuclear arms control agreement may be useful as an aspirational polestar, unwavering commitment to the pursuit of such an agreement in the current strategic environment may prove burdensome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When&lt;/strong&gt; should the United States engage Russia and China in arms control? Pressure on Washington is likely to increase with the approaching expiration of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) in 2026 and from the NPT community to demonstrate progress on arms control and disarmament. But cooperation with Russia on any strategic issues is politically risky in the near future. The present U.S.-Russia relationship is defined by crisis management and attempts to strengthen deterrence against further escalation, as well as by assuring European allies. International opinion remains firmly with Ukraine, and Eastern European allies might perceive any overtures to Moscow for dialogue as concessionary or a sign of waning U.S. commitment. To be sure, now is not the time for in-depth arms control dialogue with Russia. But when the war in Ukraine ends, Washington will still face a hard choice. On the one hand, post-conflict environments are historically a prime opportunity for arms control; on the other hand, President Joe Biden has labeled Putin a “war criminal,” meaning any future dialogue and cooperation will require delicate communications and explanations for allies and the public. Engaging with Beijing will face similar timing challenges as China continues to expand its arsenal. Leadership in Washington should pursue arms control with Moscow and Beijing when the geopolitical climate permits — and when there is a clear “why” and “what” to justify arms control overtures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How&lt;/strong&gt; can the United States pursue arms control with Russia and China? Will the format be bilateral or trilateral, formal or informal? And what are the incentives for Moscow and Beijing to join? Arms control can range from treaties to more informal agreements. In a 1985 edition of their original work, Schelling and Halperin lamented, “We regret that informal understandings and unilateral actions seem to have taken a back seat to the quest for formal agreements,” seeing potential for arms control in informal and unilateral agreements. Following the war in Ukraine, Russia’s conventional forces will likely be depleted, and it may react by increasing reliance on its nuclear deterrent. Moscow may be reluctant to agree to any limits on its strategic forces in such a climate, although this will depend on the outcome of the war. Likewise, arms control is seemingly at odds with China’s expanding arsenal. Moreover, the transparency that typically accompanies arms control goes against current Chinese practices. But there are also potential incentives for Russia and China to engage in arms control over time. First and foremost, the war in Ukraine may prove to be a “reality check” on nuclear risks and escalation for the entire international community, similar to the environment following the Cuban Missile Crisis. Additionally, as Russia will be forced to rebuild its conventional forces and China faces economic challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic, neither country can easily afford an arms race with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An essential component of integrated deterrence is tailoring the multitude of deterrence tools to an adversary. Integrated arms control will also need to be tailored to two peer competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five-priorities-for-arms-control-after-ukraine&quot;&gt;Five Priorities for Arms Control after Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has identified a series of priorities for arms control going forward, to include reestablishing leadership in arms control, emphasizing strategic stability, and avoiding costly arms racing. Balancing the requirements for deterring two peer competitors with the commitment to leading on arms control presents numerous challenges. These include rebuilding interest and confidence in arms control as a practice for strengthening strategic stability, particularly within Congress, in addition to the questions raised above. Obviously, the specifics of what arms control will look like amid deterring two peer competitors cannot be predicted, as this will be heavily influenced by the outcome of the war in Ukraine and U.S. force-posture decisions, but this paper offers five priorities that can guide such efforts: tailoring arms control to adversaries, using short-term risk reduction tools, supporting allies’ strategic interests, continuing nuclear modernization, and integrating emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trilateral arms control is a tempting prospect of “one treaty to rule them all;” however, as previously mentioned, achieving this is unlikely and may not be the best means for deterring two peer competitors. What deters Moscow will not necessarily resonate in Beijing, and vice versa. Future arms control with Russia may need to prioritize conventional forces, as both NATO members and Russia have made a push for defense production of conventional capabilities, including tanks and artillery, during the war in Ukraine. Future arms control with Russia will also likely have to prioritize tactical nuclear weapons given the quantitative imbalance. Conversely, arms control with China might be better focused on capturing its growing strategic nuclear arsenal or nonnuclear strategic capabilities, along with emerging technologies. Forcing a trilateral version of New START in the near to mid-term may serve little strategic purpose and fail to contribute to integrated deterrence and strategic stability if it holds cooperation with one adversary hostage to cooperation with the other. The U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China rivalries do not resemble each other, nor should arms control. Instead, the United States can pursue parallel, concentrated bilateral efforts to strengthen deterrence vis-à-vis Moscow and Beijing, respectively, while also pursuing multilateral efforts when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future arms control prospects appear grim and may take years to materialize. In the meantime, the United States and its allies should prioritize short-term risk reduction measures. This might take the form of confidence-building exercises — or establishing codes of conduct and rules of the road. In 2020, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace offered specific risk reduction proposals, such as data exchanges, transparency for warhead storage facilities, and launch notification agreements. When the United States can return to dialogue with Russia — or perhaps in the context of the P5 Process, a set of ongoing dialogues among the five countries the NPT designates as “nuclear weapon states” — these transparency measures could be part of a wider discussion on risk reduction. In addition to practical risk reduction measures, norms and rules of the road can also play a role in limiting the deployment of emerging technologies or potentially destabilizing nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities. During this interlude, the United States can also build capacity for future arms control efforts, such as training the next generation of negotiators and inspectors and promoting interagency expertise, including among the U.S. Department of Energy’s national laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third priority for post-Ukraine arms control while deterring two peer competitors will be furthering allies’ strategic interests — though this will not be straightforward. A strong deterrent (and, therefore, strong extended deterrent) should be at the forefront of U.S. strategic planning. Yet European and Asian allies have different understandings of U.S. credibility, security cooperation agreements, and threat perceptions regarding various adversaries. Arms control agreements need to take into account U.S. forward-deployed assets, military exercises, or other forms of cooperation with allies. Future arms control efforts will have to engage allies early and ensure that cooperation with an adversary does not come at the cost of credibility with an ally. This is not a new challenge for the United States, but it will be increasingly complex in the face of two peer competitors, multiple arms control channels, and increasingly anxious allies. The need to tailor assurance to allies is another reason to consider parallel tracks when engaging Moscow and Beijing on arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these cooperation efforts, the United States should continue with its nuclear modernization and plan to compete with Russia and China in advanced technologies. In a testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services on September 20, 2022, chair of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States Madelyn Creedon pointed to the importance of continuing to modernize all three legs of the nuclear triad, which she said had the support of the public and Congress. Other experts have warned, “As things stand today, it is not at all clear that within a few years the U.S. will retain enough to deter two well-armed nuclear competitors.” In addition, Rose Gottemoeller, a member of the commission, stressed the need to “rebuild our industrial capacity” in both the public and private sectors in order to compete with two adversaries. This need for improved capacity and competition is particularly important in advanced technologies. Although emerging technologies, such as AI-enabled and hypersonic weapons, have not played a major role in the war in Ukraine to date, their potential strategic importance should not be ruled out, especially as China is likely to have more success with these technologies than Russia and their military utility is not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-arms-control-options&quot;&gt;Future Arms Control Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future arms control options will ultimately depend on when and how the war in Ukraine ends, U.S. force posture decisions to deter two peer competitors, and wider geopolitical trends. Taking this into account, however, the framework of integrated arms control can help identify potential options that would contribute to avoiding nuclear war, strengthening strategic stability, and reducing risks of escalation. At the one end of the spectrum would be negotiating a New START follow-on — such as a treaty setting an overall warhead cap, to include both strategic and tactical nuclear weapons — between the United States and Russia before the treaty expires in 2026. Meanwhile, Washington might more actively engage China on bilateral risk reduction efforts or through multilateral forums, such as the P5 Process, to ensure there is always a “human in the loop” in nuclear decisionmaking and launch command. A trilateral version of a warhead ceiling treaty might be an option in the early 2030s if China’s arsenal continues to grow as expected. At the other end of the spectrum might be informal agreements, such as a trilateral commitment to refrain from cyberattacks on each other’s nuclear command and control, along with specific critical infrastructure targets. To reduce risks of crisis outbreak and escalation, nonnuclear opportunities for arms control could draw on lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, such as how risk reduction measures did or did not manage escalation, or building guardrails to slow the pace of future crises, such as “rules of the road” in contested geographical regions or poorly regulated domains like the information ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arms control will need to remain a tool of simultaneous competition and cooperation in the era of deterring two peer competitors. This presents numerous challenges for U.S. policymakers, who have to determine what the priority for arms control should be, whether to engage Russia and China individually or separately, and how to structure future agreements. The original principles of arms control — preventing war, managing competition, and maintaining flexibility — can continue to guide such efforts, but should be revisited and updated to reflect lessons learned from the ongoing war in Ukraine, along with the changing technological and geopolitical landscape. Integrated arms control, working in tandem with integrated deterrence, is the best way forward, albeit a challenging one.&lt;/p&gt;

The two oldest U.S. security alliances in the region — with the Philippines and Australia — illustrate this clearly.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;The U.S. alliance with Australia has never been stronger. By contrast, the United States’ alliance with the Philippines has barely survived a period of deep uncertainty and remains fragile and underdeveloped, posing significant challenges and risks to U.S. defense strategy and interests. It is increasingly urgent that the United States and Australia shore up the strategic foundations of their partnerships with the Philippines, highlight the mutual benefits of working together, and assess the role that trilateral cooperation should play in regional security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As outlined in the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS), the United States is engaged in long-term strategic competition with China that is playing out with particular intensity in the Indo-Pacific. Beijing seeks to undermine the U.S. alliance system and displace the United States as the preeminent power in the region. Given China’s clear strategic intent, the focus in the NDS on strengthening alliances is well placed, but U.S. alliances in the Indo-Pacific vary dramatically in terms of reliability, capability, and clarity of strategic rationale. The two oldest U.S. security alliances in the region — with the Philippines and Australia — illustrate this clearly. The U.S. alliance with Australia has never been stronger. The two are developing new defense capabilities, building interoperability, and increasingly working together as a networked security architecture. The Australia-United Kingdom-United States pact, or AUKUS, is just the latest sign of this increasingly robust partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the United States’ alliance with the Philippines has barely survived a period of deep uncertainty under the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte. While Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s administration has signaled that it will prioritize the Philippines’ relationship with the United States, the alliance remains fragile and underdeveloped, posing significant challenges and risks to U.S. defense strategy and interests. However, this alliance remains critically important for the United States, both for the benefits the United States derives from bilateral cooperation in peacetime and for the role the alliance plays in U.S. defense planning above or just below the threshold of conflict. If China succeeds in peeling the Philippines away from the United States, it will profoundly weaken the strategic position of the United States, Australia, and other allies within the broader Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is increasingly urgent that the United States and Australia shore up the strategic foundations of their partnerships with the Philippines, highlight the mutual benefits of working together, and assess the role that trilateral cooperation should play in regional security. Furthermore, defense policymakers in the United States and Australia need to better understand Philippine strategic assessments and threat perceptions to inform assumptions about the role the Philippines would play in the event of conflict with China, including in a Taiwan contingency. How do Filipino and Australian strategic planners view China? How can the United States and its allies respond to — and deter — Chinese gray zone activities? What are the implications of a Taiwan contingency on regional stability, and how would Manila and Canberra respond to such a crisis? Under what circumstances would the Philippines allow access for U.S. and allied forces flowing into the region in the event of an emerging conflict?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to answer these questions, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) convened a trilateral U.S.-Australia-Philippines track 2 strategic dialogue in August 2022 in Manila, Philippines. The dialogue was intended to provide a platform for U.S., Australian, and Filipino experts and practitioners to discuss practical issues of alliance coordination, share insights regarding each country’s respective strategic outlooks, and consider the ways in which the security triangle could be operationalized in a time of conflict. CSIS concluded the dialogue by hosting a tabletop exercise involving a complex near-future crisis in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion at the dialogue largely spanned four key themes: the need to assess and align strategic outlooks and threat perceptions in Washington, Manila, and Canberra; the challenges associated with Chinese gray zone activities and potential pathways toward enhancing resilience; the growing need for all three countries to consider how a Taiwan contingency would not only impact alliance obligations, but also affect their own respective national security priorities; and the current limited ability of the security triangle to respond to a South China Sea crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dialogue informed the findings and recommendations in this brief, although all opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the dialogue participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us-australia-philippines-security-triangle&quot;&gt;The U.S.-Australia-Philippines Security Triangle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Philippines alliance has experienced an upswing since then-president Rodrigo Duterte’s decision to recall the abrogation of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) in 2021. Early signs demonstrate that the Marcos Jr. administration is generally less skeptical of the United States than its predecessor and views the alliance as a top priority. President Biden’s meeting with President Marcos Jr. in New York in September 2022 represents a positive step forward — as well as the first time a sitting Philippine president visited the United States since the late president Benigno Aquino III attended the Sunnylands summit in 2016 — with the United States affirming its commitment to the defense of the Philippines. Whether these trends continue and the alliance undergoes much-needed modernization will ultimately depend on it continuing to receive high-level political and military attention from both sides. Implementation of the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) remains years behind schedule, the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ modernization plans need a considerable increase in support, and the long-term viability of the alliance rests on a number of agreements and new institutions currently under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Australia alliance has also experienced a surge in activity in recent years. Canberra and Washington have seen increased alignment on strategic outlooks, as evidenced by enhanced U.S. rotational access to Australian facilities, collaboration through the Quad, and the AUKUS pact. The transition to a Labor government led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in May 2022 has further opened the door to enhanced cooperation with the United States, including in relation to the Biden administration’s stated focus on issues like climate change. Albanese has also cast himself as a foreign policy–oriented premier, attending the Quad summit in Tokyo immediately after being sworn in and directing his cabinet to embark on a series of diplomatic tours to affirm Australia’s position in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s growing role in the Indo-Pacific underscores the need for Canberra and Washington to collaborate more closely in engaging with other alliance partners, including the Philippines. Australia is uniquely suited to this role as it is the only country other than the United States to have a Status of Forces Agreement with the Philippines. As a result, Australia and the Philippines enjoy a significant degree of security cooperation, including the presence of Australian mobile training teams on the ground undertaking capacity-building work on counterterrorism, urban warfare, maritime security, and other fronts. Yet, despite the wide array of ongoing bilateral activities and the significant potential for enhanced Australia-Philippines cooperation, high-level discussion on the merits of the partnership remains limited and has only just begun to emerge in Australian policy circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-outlooks-and-threat-perceptions&quot;&gt;Strategic Outlooks and Threat Perceptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared challenges faced by Manila, Washington, and Canberra necessitate a review of strategic outlooks and threat perceptions in all three capitals, along with an examination of the extent to which Philippine, U.S., and Australian assumptions about these alliances and partnerships cohere amid strategic competition with China. The 2022 Indo-Pacific Strategy made clear the Biden administration’s intent to strengthen the United States’ long-term position in, and commitment to, the Indo-Pacific. Congress remains steadfast in its bipartisan support for shoring up U.S. alliances to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific and counter China’s advances in the region. Thus, in the face of continued reservations about U.S. staying power in the region and a challenging strategic environment in Europe and the Middle East, Washington has signaled that its commitment to the Indo-Pacific remains robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s presence at the forefront of Beijing’s coercive activities in the Indo-Pacific has significantly sharpened strategic outlooks toward China in recent years. Opinion polling demonstrates that a majority of the Australian public now views China as a security threat. The Australian political and security establishment, mirroring the public, has largely reached consensus on its views of China, even as the governing Labor Party and the opposition Liberal-National Coalition disagree over tactics and tone in foreign policy. Australia’s experience with China’s coercive activities and its long-standing history of alignment with the United States in times of conflict mean that Canberra is an essential partner for Washington in countering challenges to the regional order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic outlooks in Manila, by contrast, remain in transition. The shift from a decades-long focus on internal threats to a more maritime-oriented external defense doctrine is underway. But this shift is constrained by limited state resources and colored by concerns about U.S. credibility, made especially salient by the huge disparity in power between the two allies and the economic necessity to balance engagement and confrontation in China policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Australian views on China, which have largely sharpened in recent years, there is no singular view of China policy in the Philippines. The state and military bureaucracy, public opinion, and business interests are broadly pro-American and suspicious of Beijing — and becoming more so in the wake of China’s increasing coercion. But they remain divided on how to respond to that coercion. An influential minority within the political and business elite continues to view the U.S.-Philippines alliance as a destabilizing factor that could upend Manila’s ties with Beijing and lead the Philippines into unwanted conflict. That minority continues to use the narrative of U.S. failure and ambiguity during the Scarborough Shoal standoff in 2012 to insist that, when push comes to shove, the United States will not stand with its ally. The power of this line of argument has been diminished by the increasing clarity of U.S. declaratory policy and closer alliance coordination over the last decade, but it is unlikely to disappear entirely any time soon. Moreover, views on China in the Philippines are divided across geographic lines, with some subnational actors in places like Mindanao and northern Luzon increasingly reliant on Chinese investment and people-to-people ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divergences in Philippine and Australian threat perceptions are compounded by differences in capacity to respond to Chinese coercion and other material and non-material factors. As an advanced economy, Australia has been better able to absorb economic coercion, and its military capabilities mean that it is ultimately better equipped than the Philippines to respond to gray zone challenges. Furthermore, Australia’s status as a mature democracy means that it is generally less tolerant of authoritarian practices and challenges to the regional order, more resilient to misinformation and influence operations, and more likely to view a China-dominated order as a threat to Australia’s interests and worldview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, changes in government in both Canberra and Manila have reshaped Australian and Philippine strategic outlooks. As noted above, the Australian political establishment has largely reached consensus in their views on China, though the new Labor government has opted to strike what it views as a more delicate tone in approaching Beijing and regional partners. While President Marcos Jr. has generally taken a stronger position toward Beijing than his predecessor and sought to deepen relations with the United States, his focus on economic recovery and attracting foreign investment makes it likely that he will try to balance this with outreach to China, to say nothing of the Marcos family’s own long-standing ties with the Chinese business community. However, no matter what Marcos Jr.’s own perspectives toward China may be, it is likely that the Philippine foreign policy and security establishment will ultimately constrain the president’s ability to make any extreme overtures toward Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing dynamics in the regional security landscape have also shifted strategic outlooks in the three capitals, including challenges associated with China’s nuclear buildup and other proliferation risks. Yet, while both Washington and Canberra have increasingly voiced concern regarding the threat of nuclear escalation in a Taiwan contingency or other crises, issues related to nuclear buildup and proliferation remain underdiscussed and understudied in Manila. To the extent that public discourse in the Philippines focuses on nuclear risks, this discourse largely centers on evincing concern around narratives that AUKUS could negatively impact nonproliferation in the region — even while Philippine views on the pact are largely positive relative to those of its immediate neighbors. Manila generally views China’s nuclear ambitions and the threat of nuclear escalation as a less critical issue relative to other, more immediate threats posed by Beijing in the maritime, cyber, and information domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite clear opportunities for Australia and the Philippines to deepen cooperation, neither capital has prioritized its partnership with the other at the level one would expect given the increasing convergence in their strategic outlooks and the logic of closer coordination. In contrast to the U.S. government, Canberra has not historically given the Philippines as much priority in its regional strategy as Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, or especially Indonesia. In the Philippines, meanwhile, high-level discourse on non-U.S. partnerships tends to focus on Japan and South Korea. Filipinos evince warm feelings toward Australia in public opinion polls and the military maintains significant on-the-ground cooperation, but those ties are rarely top of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Philippine and Australian strategic outlooks will be shaped by overall views toward the United States and U.S. credibility as a guarantor of regional stability and security. While support for the U.S.-Australia alliance is at an all-time high, this largely reflects anxieties about the threat posed by China, rather than a vote of confidence in the reliability of the United States. And despite these concerns, neither Australia nor the Philippines have a plan B in the event of waning U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific, as only the United States currently has the weight needed to balance China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enhancing-resilience-against-gray-zone-challenges&quot;&gt;Enhancing Resilience against Gray Zone Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has leveraged an extensive tool kit of coercive measures in the region, including activities that fall in the gray zone short of conflict — weaponizing investments in critical infrastructure and using economic coercion, employing influence operations and disinformation campaigns, and deploying maritime militia and coast guard vessels in Philippine waters. Coupled with a general increase in China’s risk tolerance, these levers of influence have granted Beijing a wide range of policy options and approaches that enhance the risks associated with sub-conflict disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the South China Sea, Beijing’s island-building campaign and its deployment of law enforcement and maritime militia vessels have significantly altered the strategic landscape, allowing Beijing to harass oil and gas operations and restrict Philippine resupply vessels’ access to the isolated Filipino Marines stationed aboard the BRP Sierra Madre at Second Thomas Shoal. The broad span of China’s gray zone activities points to the need for an “all of the above” approach that encompasses both military and diplomatic solutions to deterring Chinese behavior. But successful responses to gray zone activities will ultimately be contingent on whether the United States, Australia, and the Philippines are able to determine what specific approaches would credibly deter Chinese aggression, let alone whether there are activities that the United States and its allies simply cannot deter. Responses to Chinese gray zone activities could encompass both offensive and defensive measures, particularly in the informational realm. This could include declassifying intelligence relevant to Chinese coercive behavior (in a manner similar to U.S. declassification of information related to Russian activities prior to and during the invasion of Ukraine), while also focusing on enhancing domestic military capabilities and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to respond to gray zone activities will be complicated by the extent to which the Philippines remains vulnerable to Chinese influence operations and elite capture. This includes ongoing narratives regarding China’s overwhelming economic dominance in the Philippines. Whether they are overstated or not, these narratives of economic dominance and political influence speak to the success of China’s information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The broad span of China’s gray zone activities points to the need for an “all of the above” approach that encompasses both military and diplomatic solutions to deterring Chinese behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, enhancing domestic resilience includes the continued modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, including procurement of BrahMos cruise missile systems or other similar platforms. Such weapons systems would effectively allow the Philippines to raise China’s short-term costs in a time of conflict, mirroring Vietnam’s approach to military modernization in recent decades. This approach has focused on the acquisition of a small but capable number of advanced surface, undersea, and air platforms paired with asymmetric strike capabilities to ensure that it can give China a “bloody nose” in any contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-a-taiwan-contingency&quot;&gt;Implications of a Taiwan Contingency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in early August, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and perceived parallels between that conflict and China’s behavior in the Indo-Pacific, have helped sharpen the region’s focus on the prospect of a Taiwan contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines’ proximity to Taiwan means that simple geography, to say nothing of the alliance with the United States, could drag Manila into a Taiwan contingency. This in turn highlights the need for Filipino strategic thinkers to consider the potential impacts of such a conflict. Much in the same way that South Vietnamese refugee ships fled to Subic Bay during the fall of Saigon, a cross-strait contingency could lead to Taiwanese vessels evacuating to the Philippines. With northern Luzon less than 200 miles from Taiwan, and the Batanes Islands even closer, a refugee crisis seems inevitable in the case of a Taiwan contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines has nearly 200,000 overseas foreign workers based in Taiwan, and their evacuation — likely impossible in the face of an outright invasion of the island — would be a top priority if conflict were to break out across the Taiwan Strait. The Philippines also has a much smaller, but still sizeable, number of overseas foreign workers in mainland China, and even more in Hong Kong. This raises the possibility that those workers could become political leverage for Beijing in a time of conflict and limit the Philippines’ flexibility in responding to a Taiwan contingency. The direction of public sentiment in such a crisis — whether demanding intervention on behalf of those Filipinos in Taiwan or restraint in the name of those in China — is difficult to predict. Much would depend on the details and scale of the crisis, including the number of Filipinos killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proximity of Philippine territory to Taiwan also makes it an attractive staging point for U.S. intervention and a possible target for Chinese retaliation. Both the United States and the Philippines have increasingly recognized that Washington would expect access and support in any crisis endangering the lives of U.S. service members. Most Filipino strategic thinkers recognize that is part of the price of a more “equal” alliance with the United States that both the Duterte and Marcos governments have sought. To this end, if the Philippine government wants the United States to increase security assistance and stay committed to defending Filipino lives in the contested South China Sea, then Manila must meet matching obligations. U.S. forces will require greater access to the country to rotate forces and pre-position equipment to credibly project power over both the South China Sea and Taiwan. The extent to which the Philippine strategic community has internalized the implications of reciprocity — meaning that the Philippines has obligations to the United States under Articles II, IV, and V of the Mutual Defense Treaty, not just vice versa — is unclear. The security establishment appears more cognizant of these than the wider political and academic community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Candid, ongoing, and at times difficult, discussions on alliance obligations and their role in a Taiwan contingency between the United States and the Philippines at the track 1.5 and track 2 levels mirror the talks currently underway between the two governments as part of the ongoing process of alliance modernization. At the 9th U.S.-Philippines Bilateral Strategic Dialogue last year, interlocuters from the Biden and Duterte administrations set forth a roadmap for modernizing the alliance. They agreed to negotiate their first set of joint defense guidelines and a military information-sharing agreement, launch a new maritime security dialogue, increase U.S. capacity-building support to the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and implement the long-delayed 2014 EDCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDCA allows the United States to gain access to five predetermined Philippine military sites to fund upgrades, pre-position equipment, and engage in joint training and operations. In addition to implementing the agreement at those five sites, the allies are seeking to expand it to additional locations, which has fueled speculation that new sites would include facilities in northern Luzon, less than 200 miles from Taiwan. Moreover, ongoing discussion on the risks associated with a Taiwan contingency has raised expectations that the United States would look to the Philippines to, among other things, help monitor the Bashi Channel and prevent any undetected Chinese breakout from the first island chain in a crisis scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Australia has met rising concern over a Taiwan contingency by increasing funding for high-end capabilities and other deterrent responses — as have Japan, South Korea, and other partners. But Australian public opinion and strategic thinking toward Taiwan generally come from a low base of knowledge, viewed more through the prism of U.S. alliance obligations rather than a clear articulation of what Taiwan — and the defense of Taiwan — means for Australian national security interests. And few, if any, of Australia’s recent strategy documents — including the 2020 Defence Strategic Update — explicitly reference Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, with regard to the Philippines, it remains generally unclear the extent to which the Marcos Jr. administration has focused on thinking through how a Taiwan contingency would impact the country. To this end, both Australia and the Philippines need to take major steps toward articulating why Taiwan matters to their foreign policy and national security interests outside of the narrow prism of their U.S. alliance commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us-australia-philippines-security-triangle-in-a-south-china-sea-crisis&quot;&gt;The U.S.-Australia-Philippines Security Triangle in a South China Sea Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given current force posture, weak alliance coordination, and political uncertainties, the U.S.-Australia-Philippines security triangle would face considerable challenges in responding to a South China Sea contingency. In particular, the Philippines’ ability to respond to a gray zone challenge in the South China Sea will depend on Manila’s ability to break through excessive internal debate and bureaucratic red tape. This includes ongoing debates on when to view a gray zone challenge as a national security crisis to be overcome or a foreign policy issue to be managed, and when to declare a national emergency and explicitly invoke the Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States. Public opinion will also play a key role in shaping Philippine responses to a gray zone crisis, as public opinion, traditional media, and social media have taken an increasingly central role in the Philippine policy discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States and Australia, a lack of considered preplanning or of a prearranged playbook between allies for responding to a gray zone crisis remains a significant hurdle. Absent the expansion of EDCA sites in the near term, the United States will lack the ability to quickly move assets into the region in response to a crisis scenario, ultimately forcing Washington and its allies into a reactive, rather than proactive, posture. Meanwhile, Australia’s role in a South China Sea crisis will ultimately be limited by the lack of a direct alliance with the Philippines. Limited preplanning across all sides of the security triangle is in turn compounded by a general lack of discussion on rules of engagement in a gray zone contingency and a lack of clarity on whether Manila would be willing to stomach the initiation of conflict, or if it would prefer to stop short of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Absent the expansion of EDCA sites in the near term, the United States will lack the ability to quickly move assets into the region in response to a crisis scenario, ultimately forcing Washington and its allies into a reactive, rather than proactive, posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Findings and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; An increasingly complex threat environment points to the need for continued and robust dialogue between the United States and partners in the Philippines and Australia. High-level discussion in Manila policy circles on the threat associated with nuclear escalation and proliferation remains underdeveloped, and these risks are generally underestimated relative to challenges in other domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendation 1: Washington should seek more opportunities for high-level track 1.5 and track 2 dialogues with Manila and Canberra. Dialogues held in the trilateral context would grant a degree of political cover to discuss issues that might otherwise be sensitive in the bilateral context. Such dialogues would help build a broader coalition of support for not only each country’s respective relations with the United States but relations between U.S. allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendation 2: The United States should seek out more opportunities for high-level track 1 and track 1.5 dialogues between Washington and counterparts in Manila on nuclear issues. Dialogues could be held in the bilateral or trilateral format, and they would allow the Philippine policy community to internalize and take part in the discussions on nuclear deterrence and risk reduction within the U.S. alliance network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; At present, the United States lacks the ground-based air assets or ground-based missiles to be able to respond effectively to a South China Sea contingency, while the Philippines’ military modernization remains sluggish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendation 3: The United States should not only move swiftly to fully implement EDCA and expand it to include other bases but also encourage the Philippines to continue its process of military modernization, including the procurement of BrahMos anti-ship missiles, unmanned platforms, and other asymmetric strike capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Australia’s presence and engagement with Southeast Asia has traditionally been anchored in its closest neighbor, Indonesia. But the Philippines’ unique status — including its role in the U.S. alliance network, its own robust ties with Canberra, and its position at the front lines of China’s coercive activities — means that firming up relations with Manila will be critical for Australia moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendation 4: Canberra needs to invest time and political capital into shoring up relations with Manila, particularly in the context of the upcoming Defence Strategic Review. The United States should use its bilateral dialogues with Australia to encourage it to do so, and it should seek to bring Australian officials into the mechanisms of the U.S.-Philippines alliance (such as the annual Mutual Defense Board-Security Engagement Board meetings) as observers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s maritime militia poses a potent threat to the ability of Southeast Asian nations, including the Philippines, to exercise their sovereign rights in the waterways of the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendation 5: In line with the Quad’s Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, the United States and Australia should continue to invest in the remote sensing capabilities of its Southeast Asian and Pacific partners, allowing regional states better visibility into activities occurring in their waters. The United States, Australia, and like-minded partners like Japan should also explore avenues for unmanned data collection in the South China Sea in partnership with the Philippines. Fifth Fleet’s Task Force 59 in Bahrain offers a good model that could be pursued by Seventh Fleet from the Philippines. The United States should publicly clarify that it would treat militia vessels that intentionally endanger the lives of U.S. or allied personnel as armed combatants, and that any attack on Philippine troops or vessels by militia falls within the scope of Articles IV and V of the Mutual Defense Treaty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; The BRP Sierra Madre is the most vulnerable Philippine facility in the South China Sea, with resupply missions facing frequent interference by Chinese militia and coast guard forces. This makes it the most likely site for military escalation in the South China Sea at present. It is also the only Philippine outpost whose legal status within the context of the alliance is crystal clear: it is an underwater feature within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and China can make no claim upon it. Loss of control over the feature would be severely damaging to the Philippines politically and strategically, not to mention to the credibility of the U.S.-Philippines alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendation 6: The United States and the Philippines should focus on contingency planning for a Second Thomas Shoal crisis, including a U.S. commitment to help resupply the garrison if needed in case of a blockade. The United States should help the Philippines assess the structural integrity of the Sierra Madre and repair or replace it to ensure permanent control over the feature by Manila.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States currently shares sensitive information with the Philippines through a Communications Interoperability and Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA), which is set to expire in March 2023. Without a replacement, information sharing and alliance coordination will be severely hampered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendation 7: The United States and Philippines should conclude a permanent General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA). Negotiations for a GSOMIA are underway and were flagged as a priority at the annual Bilateral Strategic Dialogue last year. That high-level focus from military and political leaders, if maintained, should be enough to break through the sticking points in negotiations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; China maintains significant diplomatic and economic largesse in Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific. In particular, Beijing has embarked on a campaign of subnational diplomacy in both Australia and the Philippines, undermining their respective national governments’ ability to formulate a coherent and unified China strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendation 8: The United States should redouble its efforts toward engaging with local and subnational stakeholders — whether through diplomatic, economic, or military-to-military channels — focusing on outlying regions of the Philippines vulnerable to China’s economic heft. The State Department’s recent appointment of Ambassador Nina Hachigian — formerly U.S. ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations — as special representative for subnational diplomacy is a welcome step in the right direction. The United States must continue to build on this momentum and establish comprehensive interagency mechanisms for focusing time, attention, and resources to local and subnational stakeholders that may be disconnected or disenfranchised from the Manila and Canberra elite. This should include the reopening of the U.S. consulate in Cebu and the exploration of new consulates in Davao and Ilocos Norte, both of which already host Chinese consulates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s island-building activities in the South China Sea not only impact the military and strategic balance in Southeast Asia, but also pose risk to the health of the marine ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendation 9: The United States, Australia, and other regional partners should collaborate on scientific efforts focused on understanding and publicizing the risks associated with China’s activities in regional waters and their potential impact on Southeast Asian fisheries and marine resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For this report, RUSI’s Open-Source Intelligence and Analysis (OSIA) and Military Sciences departments used extensive datasets of components and microelectronics sourced from disassembled Russian weapons either captured or expended in Ukraine since February 2022. These compilations of technical assessments were databased, standardised and categorised to enable further analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical inspection of the platforms contained in this report by RUSI during fieldwork confirmed the authenticity and accuracy of this data, which was also compared to product descriptions and serial numbers published by a wide variety of manufacturers. It should be noted that grey and black markets for counterfeit components and microelectronics are a global problem, meaning that fool-proof corroboration is a challenging endeavour. Given the evidence assessed here and the long history of Soviet and Russian military procurement efforts targeting the world’s leading technology and microelectronic companies, the research team operated under the assumption that the majority of these parts were likely genuine. Assessments conducted internally by the Russian government, and seen by the authors, highlighting critical dependence on a number of foreign manufacturers, increases the confidence that the components identified in Russian weapons are genuine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This data was then married with a range of other sources, such as shipment-level trade data, import and export declarations, court records, financial information sourced by Reuters and iStories, and corporate records in Russian in an attempt to better understand a particular Russian procurement network while also placing the Orlan-10, a Russian UAV, in its tactical and operational context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;identification-of-individuals-companies-and-governments-in-this-report&quot;&gt;IDENTIFICATION OF INDIVIDUALS, COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENTS IN THIS REPORT&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The purpose of this report is to understand and explain how the Russian military depends on Western technology. To achieve this purpose, it identifies a number of individuals/companies/governments who are believed to be involved in the designing and manufacturing of components which have been acquired by the Russian military and are used in their military hardware. For the avoidance of doubt, RUSI does not impute any allegations of wrongdoing on the part of these individuals/companies/governments and makes no representations or assertion that these individuals/companies/governments have any involvement in any sanctions evasion-related activity or are involved in directly or indirectly supplying the Russian military and/or Russian military customers in breach of any international (or their own domestic) laws or regulations restricting or prohibiting such action, unless expressly stated in the report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A joint investigation between RUSI, Reuters and iStories has found that Russian companies closely associated with the St Petersburg-based Special Technology Centre Limited Liability Company (STC LLC or STC) – the Russian military-affiliated manufacturer of the Orlan-10 UAV – have drastically increased imports of critical Western-manufactured components since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These imports will likely enable the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) to maintain and expand production of the country’s most successful UAV – a platform that sits at the heart of the country’s warfighting capabilities and enables the AFRF to rain accurate fire down on Ukrainian formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial records, customs data, court records, Russian company filings and a range of other open sources indicate that many of these Western-manufactured imports are likely being procured by a St Petersburg-based company named SMT-iLogic on behalf of STC, which was first sanctioned by the US government in December 2016 for supporting Russia’s interference in the 2016 US Presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These components, which are critical both to Russia’s plans to expand UAV production and its ongoing operations in Ukraine, are being shipped to Russia by a variety of distributors based in the United States, Europe, China, South Korea and Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, these exporters appear to be operated by Russian nationals or expatriates based abroad with limited public profiles. In one such case, a US company owned by an individual with Russian and American citizenship named Igor Kazhdan shipped large volumes of export-controlled components to SMT-iLogic and another company named Device Consulting, also based in St Petersburg, in violation of US export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of SMT-iLogic’s largest suppliers since the start of Russia’s invasion have been a range of Hong Kong companies, some with a history of evading sanctions and providing military equipment to the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Networks such as those profiled in this report are core to Russia’s ability to procure advanced microelectronics for its weapons programs. As the United States and its allies seek to restrict Russia’s ability to access the world’s most advanced technologies, trade restrictions such as export controls and sanctions are emerging as core tools available to policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report highlights methodologies that can be used by state and non-state actors alike in combating Russian sanctions evasion networks. Approaches demonstrated in this report, including the use of open-source information, integration of modern data analysis methods, and the use of commercial technologies, can successfully identify sanctions evasion networks in detail and at scale. If governments wish to slow shipments to critical Russian military programmes such as the Orlan-10, they should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase their ability to amass, analyse, and action open-source information through investments in data storage, processing, and visualization. Artificial intelligence will be a core part of several capabilities that can materially improve export control and sanctions enforcement, such as the creation of graph databases showing historical trading relationships, entity resolution, text extraction, machine translation, and geolocation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase use of commercial analytics and data providers. As demonstrated in this report, commercial tools available today can allow for the identification of export control and sanctions evasion networks at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curate the data environment to ensure that actionable information flows to enforcement authorities to the maximum degree allowed by law. Enforcement authorities should work with Congress to pass laws that expand visibility into trade, corporate and risk data that would provide actionable intelligence on sanctions evasion networks, while safeguarding privacy and civil liberties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adopt systems that allow for data-driven interoperability with allies, including by adopting information architectures that allow for easy and secure sharing of information. The US is just one node in a global trading web used by sanctions and export control evaders – successful enforcement necessarily depends on joint action. The US can bring to bear open-source information and federated data architectures to share information with partners, even where sharing classified information is undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partner with, and make greater use of, non-state analytical organisations with expertise in identifying illicit activity using open-source information. As this report demonstrates, non-state analytical actors possess significant expertise in identifying sanctions and export control evasion. The US and its allies should engage robustly with these organisations to share leads, investigative techniques, tools and data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, improving this capability this will entail investments in the government’s ability to amass, analyse, and action large quantities of publicly-available and commercial information. This will allow the government to more quickly and comprehensively identify and address gaps in its enforcement of sanctions and export controls, allowing it to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rapidly sanction entities and individuals involved in the illicit supply chain of components to the AFRF.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify and prosecute individuals knowingly evading sanctions and export controls to ship components to the AFRF or those acting on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthen the monitoring of components and microelectronics moving to Russia and the identity of end-users to which they are being shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve guidance and expand capacity-building operations for private sector companies and financial institutions engaged in exporting or financing these component flows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orlan-10 UAV has proven to be one of the most critical components of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation’s (AFRF) lethality in Ukraine. Designed and manufactured by Russia’s Special Technology Centre Limited Liability Company (STC LLC or STC), the Orlan-10 is a sophisticated yet relatively affordable UAV, costing approximately $87,000-120,000 per system. The UAV can carry a wide range of military payloads, enabling it to conduct a variety of missions and to be used in combination with other systems, including other UAVs, for more advanced combinations of effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common and deadliest use of Orlan-10s by the AFRF in Ukraine is as part of an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance complex. The UAVs are used to locate Ukrainian troops and vehicles from medium altitudes and relay their positions for rapid artillery, missile and loitering munition strikes. When an Orlan-10 is overhead, Russian artillery response times can be as short as three minutes from target detection, leaving those targets almost no time to escape the fire zone. By contrast, response times when UAVs are not overhead are generally around 20 minutes, affording Ukrainian units the opportunity to relocate and avoid destruction. The centrality of artillery firepower to battlefield tactics on both sides means that the presence or absence of Russian UAVs in Ukraine is a core determinant of Russian lethality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orlan-10 is particularly challenging for Ukrainian ground forces to counter. It can reportedly reach speeds of at least 150km/h and a maximum altitude of 5,000 metres. The ability to fly at these relatively fast speeds and high altitudes allows the Orlan-10 to operate beyond the range of most man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS), and also makes the UAV harder to detect and engage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IloZDPM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Orlan-10 Military Sensors and Payloads.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: OE Data Integration Network – US Government; Information provided to RUSI; graphic designed by RUSI OSIA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Orlan-10 boasts hardened radio datalinks with frequency-hopping capabilities and an accurate inertial navigation system that renders it difficult to effectively jam using electronic warfare (EW).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to artillery spotting, the AFRF uses the Orlan-10 for effective suppression and destruction of enemy air defence (SEAD/DEAD) operations in Ukraine. For such missions, a high-flying Orlan-10 with an EW payload baits Ukrainian SA-8 and SA-11 surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, with its survivability boosted by its capacity to jam SA-8 missile proximity fuses. Once a SAM is launched to engage the UAV, a second Orlan-10 at a lower altitude geolocates the SAM’s launch system using electronic intelligence capabilities and cues a third Orlan-10 which uses an electro-optical payload to designate the launch system as a target for rapid artillery or missile strikes from Russian forces. Given this flexibility and effectiveness from a mass-produced system, constraining and countering Orlan-10s is one of the Ukrainian military’s top priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;built-in-russia-made-abroad&quot;&gt;Built In Russia, Made Abroad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the impressive success of Russia’s most prevalent UAV system is the St Petersburg-headquartered STC, a limited liability company with extensive connections to the country’s leading research centres and Russia’s expansive military industrial complex. However, while the Orlan-10 is designed and built in Russia by a range of scientists and engineers from flagship Russian military research institutes, its construction is highly dependent on Western technology and components historically procured through suppliers based in the US, Europe and East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fieldwork conducted by RUSI in Ukraine over the course of 2022 confirmed that the sub-systems of the Orlan-10 are heavily reliant on foreign-made microelectronics. This is particularly the case for a range of products such as the microcontrollers, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers and pressure sensors that enable the UAV to collect and transmit relevant data to the operator, sometimes over 100 km away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these Western-manufactured components are also subject to export controls, meaning that those seeking to ship them abroad require a licence to do so. Even before Russia’s February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, US manufacturers could not legally export goods subject to US Department of Commerce Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to Russian defence companies – and certainly not to designated entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of Russia’s designated military entities, this has led to a need for illicit procurement tactics, including the use of front companies and transshipment hubs to move goods through the international trading system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial records for STC, acquired by Reuters and iStories, indicate that the company has remitted large volumes of money to a range of Russian companies involved in the electronics and radiocommunication businesses. One of the largest recipients is an entity named SMT-iLogic, a company based in St Petersburg that not only imports large volumes of microelectronics and components used in the Orlan-10 to Russia but also has additional extensive connections to STC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1rN5NBH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-special-technology-centre&quot;&gt;THE SPECIAL TECHNOLOGY CENTRE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded over twenty years ago, STC designs and manufactures radio and communications equipment for a range of customers, including military systems and the Orlan-10. In addition to the Orlan-10, STC manufactures other UAVs including the Orlan-1, the Orlan-2, the Orlan-30 and the Orlan-50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STC also appears to be engaged in a range of clandestine activities separate from the design and manufacture of military UAVs. In December 2016, for example, the US Department of the Treasury sanctioned STC alongside Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GU) for conducting malicious cyber-related activities. According to the US Department of the Treasury, STC was designated because it had supported the GU’s interference campaign targeting the 2016 US Presidential election. Three years later, the cyber security company Lookout alleged that STC was developing advanced mobile spyware designed to infect devices using Google Android. The spyware, dubbed Monokle, reportedly targeted a small number of individuals, including those researching Russian-backed militias in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, STC was further designated by the US, the UK, Canada, Taiwan and Japan. These designations identified STC’s role in aiding Russia’s invasion and aimed to further restrict the company’s imports of foreign technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-men-behind-the-curtain&quot;&gt;The Men Behind The Curtain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A closer look at the affiliations and activities of some of STC’s executives reveals that the company is closely linked to the Russian military, as well as SMT-iLogic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leadership of STC is largely composed of highly accomplished Russian military scientists, at least two of whom are also employed by the SM Budyonny Military Academy of the Signal Corps, a military university in St Petersburg for Russia’s signal troops. These individuals are Aleksei Vasilievich Terentiev and Oleg Vladimirovich Tsarik, both recognised as ‘Honoured Inventors of the Russian Federation’ – an accolade bestowed by the Russian president for an outstanding track record of inventions of national significance and major contributions to technological progress. The Academy’s website notes that Terentiev has been serving at the SM Budyonny Academy since 1981, including as senior researcher and head of the research laboratory. Tsarik has also held a number of positions at the Academy since 1998, including as senior lecturer in the radio intelligence and electronic warfare department. Terentiev has also been listed in the honour roll of best inventors at the Budyonny Academy, while Tsarik was named best inventor of the year by the Russian Ministry of Defence in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of June 2022, Terentiev and Tsarik are two of seven shareholders in STC and some of the company’s most prolific scientists. Since 11 May 2010, STC has filed over 70 patents for radio-electronics and other communication technologies, with the majority focused on military applications. Terentiev and Tsarik are listed as inventors on dozens of these patents, including several explicitly referencing technology related to the Orlan-10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fuzzy-logic-stcs-links-to-smt-ilogic&quot;&gt;FUZZY LOGIC: STC’S LINKS TO SMT-ILOGIC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite producing large volumes of Orlan-10s and other UAVs that are highly dependent on foreign components and technology, STC does not appear to directly import any foreign components. However, Russian bank records for STC show the company paying tens of millions of dollars to SMT-iLogic. Company records filed in 2017 show that both Terentiev and Tsarik had founded the company alongside other members of STC and were listed as shareholders at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMT-iLogic’s website notes that the company was founded in November 2015 – a year after Russia’s initial incursion into Ukraine – by a group of ‘highly-qualified specialists in information and telecommunication technology.’ This statement is consistent with the list of individuals on the company’s filings with the Russian Federal Tax Registry over the years, which include Tsarik and Terentiev and several other scientists who also share patents with both inventors. However, in August 2017, Tsarik, Terentiev and several other STC shareholders were removed from official records of SMT-iLogic, thus eliminating obvious evidence of SMT-iLogic’s links to STC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, connections between STC and SMT-iLogic persist. For example, one of the current shareholders of SMT-iLogic is a Russian national named Aleksandr Mikhailovich Shepilov. Shepilov has been listed on SMT-iLogic’s corporate documents since November 2015, suggesting that he may have been one of the founders of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like his former colleagues, Shepilov is a prolific inventor and is named on at least 45 patents granted between June 2004 and July 2019. Many of these were filed by STC and the SM Budyonny Academy, and some even list Tsarik and Terentiev as inventors alongside Shepilov. Shepilov also continued to appear on patents for STC and the SM Budyonny Academy after the founding of SMT-iLogic in 2015, including a patent granted in July 2018 for the invention of a ‘method and device for determining the coordinates of the source of radio-emissions’ that was tested with an Orlan-10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sbgJ7LE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and other collaborations suggest that Shepilov is closely connected to both STC and the Budyonny Academy and that he has continued to aid STC’s work on the Orlan-10 while being a shareholder of SMT-iLogic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMT-iLogic and STC are also linked through the address of a former STC subsidiary. In 2014, STC founded and took a 76% share in the now-liquidated Joint Stock Company Special Technologies Centre (JSC STC). On corporate documents, JSC STC listed its address as an office at 17 Nepokorennyh Prospekt in St Petersburg. The address that SMT-iLogic lists on its website is a nearby unit in the same building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significantly, this building also houses the Autonomous Non-Commercial Organisation of Continuing Professional Education Centre for the Training of Unmanned Systems Professionals (CP SBS). Founded in August 2014, the CP SBS offers training on a range of matters related to UAVs, including their operation and maintenance. Meanwhile, the Centre’s general director is Vasiliy Viktorovich Makarov, who also served as general director and founding shareholder of JSC STC. SMT-iLogic, as an undesignated entity, was likely able to serve as a deniable vehicle for STC to procure microelectronics from suppliers located outside of Russia. To do so, it relied on a large, decentralised network of suppliers located in Europe, Asia and North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;illicit-procurement&quot;&gt;Illicit Procurement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, Florida resident Igor Kazhdan was indicted by the US government for procuring and shipping a wide range of export-controlled military and dual-use technologies to Russia. Kazhdan, a dual citizen of Russia and the US, used the alias ‘Alex Stanton’ to operate two companies – IK Tech Corporation and GeoSat Microwave – in Dania Beach, Florida and California that advertised state-of-the-art commercial and military satellite technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kazhdan, however, was allegedly using his two companies to illegally procure export-controlled items for delivery to SMT-iLogic and another company based in St Petersburg named Device Consulting LLC. Russian bank records confirm that STC has also paid millions of dollars to Device Consulting, whose website – until recently – included a letter signed by ‘Alex Stanton’ certifying Device Consulting as an authorised distributor of GeoSat products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 7: Letter Signed by Alex Stanton AKA Igor Kazhdan on Device Consulting’s Website.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Documents found on www.Device.Consulting; United States of America v. Igor Kazhdan; annotations by RUSI OSIA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US indictment alleges that, between December 2021 and February 2022, Kazhdan acquired hundreds of export-controlled items from US-based manufacturers and fraudulently shipped them to Russia without a licence. In December 2021, for example, Kazhdan allegedly procured over 100 power amplifiers with defence applications produced by US company Qorvo, which he then shipped to Device Consulting in Russia. His company had also shipped Qorvo products to SMT-iLogic in April and June of the same year. These Qorvo components are very similar to those found inside a captured Orlan-10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, company-level shipment records filed between 2020 and 2022 confirm that Kazhdan’s companies exported large volumes of microelectronics to SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting, including critical components often used in the Orlan-10 that are also subject to US export controls. Between October 2020 and February 2022, for example, IK Tech Corporation dispatched over 1,300 Gumstix-produced GUM3703FEBY computer-on-module units to both SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting. This exact component was discovered in the payload control unit of an Orlan-10 and is also export-controlled by the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further examination of the shipment-level trade records also reveals that IK Tech Corporation sent SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting several shipments of foreign components manufactured by JST Manufacturing, Semtech, Texas Instruments, u-blox and Xilinx – some of the most common brands of components found inside the Orlan-10. In addition to microelectronics, the US indictment alleges IK Tech sought to procure other export-controlled items such as couple control cables also used by the US military in communications complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aggregated import records for SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting also show an intriguing procurement pattern closely mirroring the timeline of IK Tech’s shipments and the Russian military build-up along Ukraine’s border before the February 2022 invasion. SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting also significantly ramped-up imports from May 2022, possibly to supplement depleted stocks following the botched invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade records indicate that several other individuals and corporate entities have engaged in very similar shipment patterns to IK Tech Corporation, shipping almost exclusively to SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include a German company named Industrial Components Weirich, a California-registered company named GA Universal and Hong Kong-registered company named Asia Pacific Links. Since Russia’s invasion, however, SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting’s suppliers have changed as Russian imports rose drastically from pre-invasion levels. Several Hong Kong-based companies have now become the primary suppliers of SMT-iLogic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-suppliers&quot;&gt;CHINESE SUPPLIERS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of SMT-iLogic’s primary suppliers are Hong Kong-registered Xinghua Co Ltd and Sinno Electronics Co Ltd, a US-designated company previously identified by RUSI as shipping microelectronics to Russia to bolster the country’s defence industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xinghua began shipping to SMT-iLogic in December 2021 and has since become the company’s third largest supplier. Shipment-level trade data states that Xinghua has been predominantly shipping portable computers produced by Getac, a Taiwanese manufacturer of rugged computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sole director and shareholder of Xinghua is a Chinese national named Yuan Jilun, who is also the executive director and owner of Beijing-based Luchengtech Co Ltd, a supplier of information technology products to China’s defence, aviation and space industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade data also shows that Luchengtech shipped a range of goods to SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting in May, July and August 2022. This included over 200 engines used in aviation modelling produced by Chinese companies DLE and DTRC as well as data-processing and cloud-computing machines supplied by California-based Super Micro Computer Inc. In addition, between 2019 and 2021, the company sold hundreds of Getac-made portable computers to SMT-iLogic. This evidence of a relationship between these Chinese entities and AFRF-affiliated companies is particularly noteworthy, further highlighting the growing importance of Chinese companies to Russian military supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;anton-trofimov&quot;&gt;ANTON TROFIMOV&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, by far the largest supplier to SMT-iLogic – accounting for 25% of imports in 2022 – is Asia Pacific Links, a Hong Kong-headquartered company owned and controlled by a Russian national named Anton Trofimov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2019 and 2021, Asia Pacific Links shipped over $10 million’s worth of microelectronic components to Russian companies, more than half of which were destined to SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting. After Russia’s February 2022 invasion, however, Asia Pacific Links appears to have increased deliveries, shipping over $9 million of components to SMT-iLogic and Device Consulting alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of these shipments appear to have contained a range of notable components. For example, between June and August 2022 Asia Pacific Links shipped at least 800 export-controlled quad-band cellular modules to the St Petersburg office of SMT-iLogic. As noted above, these precise modules are often utilised in the Orlan-10. Other shipments in 2022 included components that have been found inside Orlan-10 UAVs, such as GNSS modules made by u-blox and computer-on-modules made by Gumstix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trofimov, who founded Asia Pacific Links in 2014, operates a number of other companies in Canada, China, Hong Kong and Macao. His LinkedIn profile also claims that he has been involved with the GP Gentlemen’s Club at the Tigre de Cristal Hotel and Resort, based just outside Vladivostok, since April 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, another one of Trofimov’s companies, the Macao-registered New Blockchain Advisory, also appears to have shipped large quantities of microelectronic components and semiconductors to Device Consulting, the St Petersburg company that received shipments from Kazhdan. One of these shipments, made in 2021, reportedly included over $6,000 of direction-finding compasses manufactured by Safran Sensing Technologies, whose products are advertised for military and UAV applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orlan-10 is one of Russia’s most essential and indirectly lethal pieces of military equipment, and one that relies on Western components for a significant number of its critical functions. The Russian military is urgently attempting to increase the number of Orlan-10s available for artillery-spotting, reconnaissance, EW and SEAD/DEAD duties in Ukraine as both sides make preparations for renewed offensive operations in spring 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production quantities required to increase numbers while also replacing combat losses implies a continued requirement for large volumes of components to be brought in through the networks identified in this report. Disrupting these networks should, therefore, be considered a high priority for Western efforts to counter sanctions evasion, since reducing the number of Orlan-10s available to the Russian military by spring 2023 would significantly reduce overall force lethality and give the Ukrainian military more room for manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian missile and aircraft manufacturing practices require many new components to be thoroughly tested and certified as safe in operation with all the other elements of each system. This also applies to some of the components that might be introduced as substitutes for Western-supplied ones in the event of a successful embargo. This process of certification – putting aside the development time to find and fit new components – is assessed to take three months, each time a change is made to the design. Hence, even if Russia were able to find technically viable substitutes for many of the Western components identified in this report, integrating them into the Orlan-10 production line would create major delays, add cost and thus help buy time for Ukrainian forces. In some cases, replacing these Western-manufactured components will be impossible in the short run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as detailed in this report, Russian companies closely associated with the manufacturer of the Orlan-10 have been able to increase imports of necessary components since the beginning of the invasion. Given that much of this technology is ultimately manufactured and produced by companies domiciled in Western states, greater effort should be made to prevent diversion to Russia’s military manufacturers by intermediaries in the US, Europe, Hong Kong and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, governments should act against those individuals and entities responsible for diverting components to the AFRF and step-up efforts to monitor their flow to important transshipment-hubs and suspicious third parties. Governments should also improve guidance and expand capacity building activities for the private sector and financial institutions in countries that are often exploited by those seeking to procure technology for the AFRF.&lt;/p&gt;

The document provides Moscow with a newly codified justification to intervene in the domestic affairs of other states, specifically those of the former Soviet Union, should it decide that the rights of local Russian-speaking groups are violated in any significant way. This brief analyzes the Kremlin’s new decree, considering the complex geopolitical context contributing to the release of the document, as well as Russia’s ability to defend the idea of the “Russian World” in the post-Soviet bloc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 5, 2022, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the “Concept of Humanitarian Policy of the Russian Federation Abroad.” The document, which runs over 30 pages, is presented by the Kremlin as an “indispensable” part of Russia’s national security strategy and foreign policy toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the new policy, coming six months after Moscow’s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, seems detached from reality. It describes the Russian Federation as a multinational and multireligious country that aspires to maintain peace and stability in the world. “This has absolutely nothing to do with the reality — the catastrophe into which Russia is plunging itself,” notes Elena Sorokina, a journalist with the Russian-language branch of Radio Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the Kremlin’s decision to roll out this new policy is directly tied to the war, as it seeks to send a threatening signal to Russia’s neighbors. The decree articulates what Moscow considers one of the driving forces behind its foreign policy decisions: the concept of the “Russian World” (Russkiy Mir). The document states that as the current “world order” attempts to politicize culture — and thus pressure “specific governments and individuals” — one of the core goals of Russia’s “humanitarian policy” should be to preserve and promote the values intrinsic to Russkiy Mir. Crucially, this concept is the latest justification for Russian intervention in neighboring countries. The decree provides an additional pretext for interfering in sovereign territories of the former Soviet Union, notably in Georgia, Moldova, and the Baltics, to protect the rights of local Russian-speaking groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By codifying the right of the Russian state to intercede for Russian speakers in its near abroad based on an ill-defined set of cultural criteria, Moscow’s newly minted humanitarian policy provides an evergreen casus belli that Russia can invoke against its neighbors. Yet though it attempts to demonstrate Russia’s strength to former Soviet states, the decree is borne out of weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “special military operation” in Ukraine is putting great strain on Russia’s economy, limiting the country’s capacity to engage with, and thus exert influence on, its post-Soviet neighbors. In this context, the humanitarian policy should be seen as an effort by the Kremlin to put countries within its sphere of influence on notice. Despite its troubles in Ukraine, including military losses, Moscow is signaling that it has not lost sight of its post-Soviet neighbors and reserves the right to intervene should they seek to exploit Russia’s current weakness. Having failed at its efforts to trigger regime change in Kyiv or gain any traction in claiming Russia was engaged in the “de-Nazification” of Ukraine, the Kremlin is using the publication of its humanitarian policy as a new addition to its means of legitimizing the war — one that is narrower in its implications for Ukraine but potentially broader in its impact on the post-Soviet space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections of the brief evaluate this policy document in greater detail, analyzing the troubling geopolitical context within which it was produced, as well as the reinvigorated concept of the Russian World and its possible effects on the post-Soviet bloc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-geopolitical-context-behind-russias-humanitarian-policy&quot;&gt;THE GEOPOLITICAL CONTEXT BEHIND RUSSIA’S HUMANITARIAN POLICY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release of the humanitarian policy follows a series of earlier diplomatic victories and recent battlefield setbacks for Russia in 2022. This context is critical to understanding Moscow’s rationale in issuing the document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin entered 2022 in a position of relative geopolitical strength. Across Russia’s post-Soviet periphery, it appeared to be the preeminent regional actor. In Belarus, Russian president Vladmir Putin’s long-held desire to further integrate the Lukashenko regime into the Russian-led Union State was continuing apace. In the Baltic states, local governments continued to express concern about the influence of Russian media and business interests over domestic Russian-speaking populations. In Georgia, the ruling Georgian Dream party continued to take a conciliatory approach in its dealings with Moscow. Elsewhere in the Caucasus, Russia had successfully brokered a ceasefire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2020, further entrenching Russia’s diplomatic and military presence within the region. Most importantly, the Kremlin’s proxies in eastern Ukraine continued their frozen conflict with Kyiv, trapping Ukraine in an ongoing border dispute that had de facto disqualified the country indefinitely from membership in either the European Union or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s position as a formidable regional power was further solidified in Central Asia in January 2022. Popular uprisings against the Kazakh government forced President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to reach out to his Russian counterpart for assistance. Tokayev’s plea and concern about another liberal “color revolution” prompted Putin to intervene militarily. Moscow swiftly deployed 2,000 soldiers, mostly Russian, to Kazakhstan, claiming that the troops represented the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) — a Eurasian intergovernmental military alliance led by Russia. The intervention succeeded in quelling the street protests, including the civil unrest in Kazakhstan’s largest city, Almaty, ultimately helping the Tokayev government reestablish control over the country. As Bayram Balci, a researcher at Sciences Po, later argued, the Kazakh crisis was so easily quelled by Moscow that it reinforced the Kremlin’s belief that former Soviet states, especially in Eurasia, were dependent on Russian power and could therefore never pursue an independent foreign policy. By assisting the Tokayev government, “Russia has demonstrated to the Kazakh elites and all other partners of Kazakhstan that without Russia the country could have sunk into the abyss.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar Russian assertions of regional hegemony were expressed by Putin in his infamous speech on February 24, 2022, declaring the start of the “special military operation” in Ukraine. Addressing the nation and the world, the Russian president claimed that Moscow had long ago accepted “the new geopolitical reality after the dissolution of the USSR” and always treated the former Soviet republics with respect and consideration. This was most recently “proven by the assistance we provided to Kazakhstan when it faced tragic events and a challenge in terms of its statehood and integrity” [emphasis added]. However, according to Putin, what Moscow would never be able to accept and tolerate was NATO’s continuous eastward expansion into Russia’s “historical lands” — especially in Ukraine, where a threatening “anti-Russia” was taking shape. Crucially, Putin contended, Moscow had to intervene in Ukraine to save millions of people with strong cultural affinity to Russia from an alleged genocide spearheaded by the central government in Kyiv but “fully controlled from the outside” (i.e., the West).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events that unfolded in January and February showcase two controversial, yet strongly intertwined, concepts underpinning the Kremlin’s foreign policy. On the one hand, Russia is represented as a guarantor of peace, integrity, and stability in its near abroad, as proven by its prompt resolution of the Kazakh crisis, support for the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, and deft mediation between Armenia and Azerbaijan. On the other hand, Moscow tolerates the “statehood and integrity” of the post-Soviet states only as long as they do not seek greater political autonomy from the Kremlin. And when certain territorial entities seek a separate path that is closer to Moscow, the Kremlin has no qualms undermining the sovereignty of its neighbors, as demonstrated by its ongoing support for separatist factions in Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine, as well as its ongoing pressure on the Baltic states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if Moscow felt itself in a position of strength before the launch of its February invasion, its continuing military setbacks, the implementation of aggressive Western sanctions, and the increasing consolidation of the Ukrainian state and national identity have forced realists within the Kremlin to reassess the country’s international position and articulate new justifications for its actions. This is the context needed to understand the release of Russia’s humanitarian policy. Published six months into Moscow’s war of aggression against Kyiv, the document articulates how the Kremlin has adjusted its foreign policy thinking to match the shifting geopolitical landscape in Russia’s near abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin first highlighted the importance of creating such a document in mid-April, when he met with the permanent members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation. The meeting followed two major military setbacks in Ukraine: a forced retreat from the Kyiv-adjacent town of Bucha on April 1, which unveiled brutal killings of civilians by Russian forces, and the sinking of Russia’s Black Sea missile cruiser Moskva after a successful Ukrainian offensive on April 13. While it is difficult to infer whether these events had any direct impact on Putin’s decision to have the humanitarian policy drafted, it is certain that these incidents significantly affected the Kremlin’s regional and international standing, showcasing Russia as a brutal, yet declining, global power. It was within this heightened and troublesome geopolitical context that Putin convened his Security Council and argued for the creation of Russia’s humanitarian policy, which would be consistent with the country’s “national interests in the near, medium, and more distant future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russkiy-mir-a-community-that-goes-far-beyond-russia&quot;&gt;RUSSKIY MIR: “A COMMUNITY THAT GOES FAR BEYOND RUSSIA”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidently, one of Moscow’s chief national interests that the humanitarian policy seeks to revive is the concept of Russkiy Mir. While Russian World is not explicitly defined in the document, the term itself is far from new. It was initially coined in Russian political circles in the late 1990s, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the country’s subsequent quest for a national identity, and revolved around the idea that Moscow had a sacred duty to defend the culture, language, and rights of all Russian speakers across the world, particularly in the former Soviet Union. According to Heather Ashby, the senior program officer for the Center for Russia and Europe at the U.S. Institute of Peace, such a “broader conceptualization of ‘Russianness’,” expanding into other sovereign territories, was a natural outcome of the Soviet collapse, which left some 25 million ethnic Russians outside of Russia’s territorial borders: “Living in a country that had long been a multinational empire, it was difficult for many Russians to accept that many of their ethnic brethren now lived in foreign countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the concept of the Russian World fit into a broader trend of Russian thinkers and policymakers grappling with the future role of the new Russian Federation. Researchers and writers such as Charles Clover have documented the ideological development of the post-Soviet Russian right, exploring the myriad ways this movement has embedded itself within, influenced, and been instrumentally co-opted by the Putin regime. More specifically, this doctrine of Russia’s moral, linguistic, and cultural supremacy in the post-Soviet bloc has been viewed by the Putin administration as “a guiding notion,” complementing and strengthening “the Kremlin’s belief that it possesses — and should continue to maintain through cultural, economic, political, and military ties — legitimate spheres of influence across the former Soviet Union.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has expressed similar sentiments numerous times in the past, most notably in April 2007, when he said during an address to the Federal Assembly, “The Russian language not only preserves an entire layer of truly global achievements but is also the living space for the many millions of people in the Russian-speaking world, a community that goes far beyond Russia itself.” In June 2007, Putin signed a decree creating the Russkiy Mir Foundation to promote Russian language and culture regionally and internationally. Today, the foundation claims that Russian World includes not only members of the Russian diaspora, but also anyone who speaks Russian and has developed “an appreciation for Russia and its rich cultural heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the revival and further elevation of the concept of Russkiy Mir in the humanitarian policy can be seen as an effort by the Kremlin to establish a cultural separation with the West by emphasizing Russian civilization’s distinctiveness. The policy comes against the backdrop of Moscow’s rising economic and diplomatic isolation, which in turn further elevates the status of the Russian World, as the decree provides a legal platform to the Kremlin to declare Russia culturally and politically superior to its near abroad. This language of defensive cultural posturing can be interpreted as part of Moscow’s reaction to the war and need to justify its invasion of Ukraine. In addition, it is also a response to the perceived threat of Western-backed “color revolutions” in the post-Soviet space; these supposedly foreign interventions by Western powers are believed to be executed by local actors pushing an anti-Russian message that is just as much about culture as it is about political institutions. The rhetorical construction of a linguistically and socially homogenous Russkiy Mir gives the Kremlin an ideological justification to intervene in Russia’s near abroad, one that can be invoked in the face of international criticism. It also sends a warning to the West: since the Kremlin wrongly perceives “color revolutions” as something done by the West to undermine Russia, Moscow is similarly signaling it can respond in kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yet the revival and further elevation of the concept of Russkiy Mir in the humanitarian policy can be seen as an effort by the Kremlin to establish a cultural separation with the West by emphasizing Russian civilization’s distinctiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why, amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine and the perceived efforts of certain Western actors to “cancel” the celebration of Russian culture internationally, analysts should continue to expect Russian leaders and state-backed news outlets to lean into the language of cultural grievance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-doctrine-of-interference&quot;&gt;THE DOCTRINE OF INTERFERENCE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document claims that one of the core principles of the Russian World, in addition to advancing Russian culture and language through “soft power,” is “noninterference in internal affairs of other states.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow has repeatedly used the now-infamous doctrine of noninterference to appeal to authoritarian governments across East Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The decree stresses the importance of deepening traditional, cultural ties with countries in these regions, singling out China and India in particular. Russia’s isolation from Europe since the war in Ukraine has accelerated the Kremlin’s own geopolitical reorientation. Putin has frequently echoed these sentiments in his speeches, signaling his intention to “pivot to the East” not only with Russian gas and oil, but also culturally and politically. Two days after signing the humanitarian policy, the president reaffirmed his intentions during a speech at the Eastern Economic Forum, held in the city of Vladivostok with the aim of driving foreign investment in Russia’s easternmost region. He referred to the countries of the Asia-Pacific region as the new cultural, economic, and technological hegemons, contributing to the shift “toward a multipolar world” and thus challenging an “obsolete” Western-led rules-based order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even if Moscow has upheld the principle of noninterference in its relations with Beijing and New Delhi, the opposite is true about the Kremlin’s intentions toward countries perceived as part of the Russian World. As mentioned above, the Putin administration respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the post-Soviet nations as long as they do not question and dispute Russia’s leading cultural, political, and economic posture in the region. This contradiction in Moscow’s thinking is embedded in the humanitarian policy. The document prioritizes the advancement of bilateral and multilateral cooperation between the Kremlin and the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a regional intergovernmental organization bringing Russia together with eight neighboring countries from Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the South Caucasus. The decree maintains that one of the central goals of Russia’s humanitarian policy will be to create “a unified cultural, educational, and informational environment” and strengthen the “historically entrenched” position of the Russian language in the CIS. Although the CIS countries cumulatively have nine different official languages, the decree only acknowledges and promotes the culture and language of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while there is no mention of Ukraine in the humanitarian policy, clause 94 of the document stresses that the Kremlin will maintain close diplomatic ties with the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic — statelet names that Putin excluded from the decree on October 17, following sham referendums held in late September that led to the proclamation of these territories as official parts of the Russian Federation. The updated version of clause 94 now only mentions two breakaway and internationally unrecognized territories: Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which Moscow acknowledged as “independent states” after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. The decree emphasizes the strengthening of diplomatic ties between the Russian Federation and these South Caucasian “republics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, clause 62 of the decree pledges to protect the rights and interests of Russian compatriots living abroad and to assist them in “the preservation of the all-Russian cultural identity.” At the same time, clause 95 warns that the Kremlin will carefully observe the “protection of the rights of Russian-speakers” in the post-Soviet states of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, and Georgia, which will impact Russia’s foreign policy decisions vis-à-vis these nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;should-the-singled-out-be-concerned&quot;&gt;SHOULD THE SINGLED-OUT BE CONCERNED?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While clauses 62 and 95 do not seem menacing at first glance, their subtext surely is. Singling out the post-Soviet states that are either in NATO and the European Union, in the case of the Baltic countries, or have pro-Western aspirations, in the case of Moldova and Georgia, is by no means an accident. Instead, it is a clear reaction to the drastically changing security environment in Russia’s “historical lands,” which the Kremlin believes have become hostile parts of Russkiy Mir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow had been basing its right to protect Russian speakers from continued oppression and discrimination in foreign countries, including Ukraine, on the United Nations’ principle of “responsibility to protect.” From now on, however, it can use the language of the humanitarian policy, specifically clause 62, to justify Russia’s interference in the domestic affairs of other post-Soviet states — presenting it as a sign of the Kremlin’s unwavering commitment to the safety and security of all Russian-speaking communities residing abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the invasion, thousands of Russians opposing Putin’s war have fled the Russian Federation, attempting to find safe havens in the neighboring countries of post-Soviet Eurasia and even the European Union. According to Kirill Krivosheev, a journalist with Russia’s Kommersant newspaper, the immediate problems created by Russian expatriates in these countries are “somewhat more mundane,” including a shortage of places and increased rent and consumer prices. Most Russians fleeing the regime do not seek to create or contribute to heightened political tensions between the Kremlin and the governments of the former Soviet countries. However, Krivosheev also notes that “given Putin’s penchant for launching wars with the purported aim of protecting ethnic Russians . . . the idea that tomorrow he may decide to ‘protect’ those Russians who have escaped his grip no longer seems entirely outlandish.” In this context, the humanitarian policy can also be viewed as a means for Moscow to justify aggressive intelligence operations in its near abroad because the Russian émigrés, even if they oppose the regime and the war, are still part of the Kremlin’s Russkiy Mir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baltic States:&lt;/strong&gt; Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, three Baltic nations with a combined population of approximately 6 million people, have sizeable Russian-speaking communities. About 25 percent of Estonia’s population of 1.3 million and Latvia’s population of 1.9 million self-identify as ethnic Russians. This number is smaller, yet still significant, in Lithuania, where 15 percent of the 2.8 million citizens belong to the local Russian-speaking minority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Baltic states have been unanimous in their efforts to curtail Moscow’s influence over ethnic Russians in their respective countries, from banning Russian and Belarusian television channels and online media outlets to demolishing Communist-era monuments. The three nations have also not been cowed by the release of the humanitarian policy. On September 7, the heads of the governments came to a joint decision to restrict entry indefinitely from Russia and Belarus for virtually all Russian citizens with EU visas. “What we have seen in the last couple of weeks and months, is that the number of border crossings by Russian citizens holding Schengen visas have dramatically increased. This is becoming a public security issue, this is also an issue of a moral and political nature,” declared Latvian minister for foreign affairs Edgars Rinkēvičs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltic states have remained similarly adamant in their decision to keep borders closed even for those Russian citizens who are running away from the partial military mobilization announced by Putin on September 21. Top diplomats have asserted that “being drafted into the army is not enough” to grant asylum to the fleeing Russians, claiming that they would still pose a significant threat to the national security of their respective nations, as well as to Euro-Atlantic stability more broadly. However, as Western European nations such as Germany and France continue to push back on efforts to block the entry into the European Union of Russians fleeing mobilization, it remains unclear to what extent the decisions of the Baltic states will affect the ability of these émigrés to seek shelter in Europe. In fact, despite facing opposition from the Baltic nations, the European Union received more than 100,000 Russian citizens in the weeks immediately following the announcement of partial mobilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argues that the travel ban on Russian citizens imposed by EU and NATO members Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania plays into President Putin’s narrative that the West uses Moscow’s “historical territories and people close to us living there” to cultivate hatred against Russia and Russians. Independent media outlets are already reporting that a rising number of Russians in these countries “are left feeling they may be losing their place in the society.” To prevent such ethnic tensions from escalating even further, Estonian president Alar Karis has called for mutual respect and sensitivity, acknowledging that “some residents of our country do have a different historical understanding,” as they “have not been taught an ideologically unbiased history of Estonia, Europe and the world.” However, considering the Kremlin’s history of malign influence operations in the Baltic states, these countries will have to ensure that their strong opposition to the Kremlin does not simultaneously alienate their own Russian-speaking minorities and thus create a vulnerability that Moscow could exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moldova:&lt;/strong&gt; Moldova is actively distancing itself from Russia. Yet the country is in a difficult political and security situation, as it still has up to 1,500 Russian troops present in the Moscow-backed breakaway region of Transnistria. Additionally, while ethnic Russians account for 6 percent of the country’s overall population, their share in Transnistria reaches 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early March 2022, Moldova applied for EU membership, seeking to cement its Westward turn. However, this was soon followed by a series of “terrorist incidents” in Transnistria, which the local de facto authorities promptly attributed to Kyiv. The central government introduced a state of emergency in the country but also stressed the importance of a diplomatic resolution of the conflict with Transnistria — which, through Moldova, maintains much stronger trade relations with the European Union than with Russia. More specifically, as a result of the 2014 Association Agreement between the European Union and Moldova, Transnistria now trades with 20 EU member states; 70 percent of its exports, including textile materials and steel products, end up in the European market. By contrast, exports to Russia experienced a steady decline, with a sharp fall from “$909 million between 2007 and 2010 to $232 million between 2015 and 2018.” Therefore, despite Transnistria’s intention to gain independence from Moldova, the local authorities seem to understand that the region’s “economic lifeline,” especially against the backdrop of a politically and economically isolated Russia, lies in its links to Brussels and Chisinau rather than to Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central authorities in Moldova also understand the changing geopolitical context and its effects on domestic policymaking. On August 27, Moldovan Independence Day, President Maia Sandu told citizens celebrating at the Great National Assembly Square in Chisinau that “Russia’s unjust war against Ukraine clearly shows us the price of freedom. . . . The war will end, and we will be able to get out of these crises stronger, more resilient.” Similar sentiments were shared by the Moldovan minister of foreign affairs and European integration in late September, strongly condemning the Kremlin’s move to hold sham referendums in Ukraine’s Donbas region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while Moldova’s pro-Western aspirations are on the rise, so is the Kremlin’s fear of losing yet another member of its Russian World. Putin believes that Russia is currently fighting not against Ukraine but “actually the entire military machine of the collective West,” which has been “nurturing the hatred of Russia for decades” across the former Soviet Union. Reflecting the president’s attitude, the humanitarian policy attempts to warn newly minted EU candidate Moldova of Moscow’s self-granted ability to protect Russian speakers in Transnistria and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Georgia:&lt;/strong&gt; It would be extremely difficult for Moscow to openly intervene in the domestic affairs of the Baltic NATO member states or even Moldova, sandwiched between Ukraine and NATO member Romania. Georgia, however, is a much easier target. According to the Institute for Development of Freedom of Information (IDFI), a local nongovernmental organization, up to 50,000 citizens of Russia were staying in Georgia between March and June 2022. This figure has grown significantly since September 21, as more than 53,000 Russians crossed the Russo-Georgian border following Putin’s order on partial military mobilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides escaping the army and the war, Russian citizens travel to Georgia to circumvent the ongoing Western economic sanctions on technology and consumer goods and Russian businesses. Based on data from Transparency International, Russian émigrés have registered about 6,400 companies in Georgia since the start of the war in Ukraine. Most of the Russians settling in Georgia are encouraged by the existing visa regime, which enables them to stay in the country visa-free for up to a year. Even though several opposition parties have argued in favor of introducing visas for Russian citizens fleeing to Georgia, the ruling Georgian Dream party has disregarded the opposition’s plea as a “xenophobic” campaign aimed at dragging Tbilisi into an armed conflict with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet public opinion polls show that up to 60 percent of Georgians are concerned about the advancement of a pro-Kremlin agenda in their country and expect Russian military aggression in the near future. Despite — or perhaps because of — this, the majority of Georgians remain highly supportive of Georgia’s EU (82 percent) and NATO (71 percent) aspirations, as well as of the Ukrainians fighting against Russian aggression (98 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 2016 commentary, Igor Zevelev, then a visiting fellow with the CSIS Russia and Eurasia Program, claimed that the Russian diaspora in the South Caucasus “is relatively small, aging, and continues to shrink. It is not mobilized and thus cannot become an instrument of Russian foreign policy.” Today, however, Georgia faces a drastically different demographic picture, as the country of 3.7 million keeps accepting thousands of Russian expatriates daily. As time goes on, analysts will need to track the increased economic influence Russian workers and investors will have on the Georgian economy and what percentage of the Russian émigrés will seek long-term residency in their new home. As the Russian presence in Georgia becomes both more pronounced and influential, clause 95 in Moscow’s new humanitarian policy will continue to make the Georgian public wary. In the past several weeks, the exact text from the decree has been continuously circulated throughout Georgian media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite significant public concern, the government has not yet commented on Moscow’s self-proclaimed right to intervene should it one day decide Russian speakers are oppressed in any way in Georgia. Conveniently, and unsurprisingly, such a “humanitarian” act could coincide with a spike in the Kremlin’s fears that Tbilisi has become too comfortable with its Euro-Atlantic partners. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already raised its concerns regarding the joint Tbilisi-NATO military exercises that took place in Georgia in September 2022, stating that the West’s continuous efforts to “draw” Tbilisi into NATO present a national security threat to Russia and jeopardize peace and stability in the South Caucasus at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kazakhstan:&lt;/strong&gt; Even though the humanitarian policy does not list Kazakhstan as one of the five former Soviet states where Moscow pledges to observe the rights of local Russian-speaking groups, the Kremlin might revisit its approach as Russia’s influence in Central Asia starts to weaken. In stark contrast to January 2022, when it seemed that the Kremlin’s grip on the Tokayev government was as tight as ever, Putin’s Kazakh counterpart has become less transparent about where his political loyalties might lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokayev was one of the first leaders within the CSTO to refuse to send troops to assist the Kremlin’s “special military operation” in Ukraine. More importantly, in a July phone call with European Council president Charles Michel, the Kazakh president expressed the country’s readiness to cooperate with the European Union on developing alternative delivery routes for oil and natural gas, including the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route — a direct affront to Moscow’s efforts to choke off European energy supplies and break the political will for the current sanctions regime. However, following Tokayev’s call with Michel, a Russian court temporarily closed down the Russo-Kazakh Caspian Pipeline Consortium’s oil terminal in Russia. This move served as a warning for the Tokayev administration not to intervene in Moscow’s energy war with the West and a reminder that the Kremlin can still influence Kazakhstan’s foreign policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, in its dealings with Russia, Kazakhstan has to factor in the thousands of Russian émigrés currently present in the country. Already, around 70,000 of them have received Kazakh ID numbers to open bank accounts and look for jobs, indicating that many Russians might be seeking a longer-term residence in this Central Asian republic. In the meantime, according to The Economist, the Kremlin “is already irked by the lack of cheerleading for its war from its supposed allies in the region,” including Kazakhstan. Therefore, as in Georgia, Moscow might use the humanitarian policy and presence of Russian speakers in Kazakhstan to check the country’s pro-Europe plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s new policy document outlines a pretext for future aggression against the post-Soviet states seeking greater political autonomy and a more liberal future. However, Russia currently finds itself in a severely weakened geopolitical position. As the Russian military is challenged in Ukraine and the economic and diplomatic effects of international sanctions become more pronounced, questions regarding Moscow’s actual capacity to uphold promises made in the humanitarian policy will become unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, experts claim that the long-held perception of the Kremlin’s authority as a mediator of conflicts and a guarantor of peace and security in the broader region is cracking. According to Jeffrey Mankoff, a senior associate with CSIS, “As Moscow bleeds in Ukraine, it is losing the ability to manipulate the other post-imperial conflicts that litter its borderlands.” Proving this point are renewed border clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the South Caucasus and Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in Central Asia. These tensions have signaled Russia’s inability to effectively involve itself in several simultaneous conflicts in the region and have thus impacted Moscow’s standing in a larger post-Soviet Eurasia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering these changing geopolitical dynamics within the Kremlin’s supposed sphere of influence, it might seem easy to dismiss the threatening language of the humanitarian policy. However, such an increasingly prominent idea of Russian weakness in the Russian World could make the Putin regime even more desperate to exert its influence and therefore willing to take even greater risks in its efforts to claim post-Soviet hegemony. As Zaur Shiriyev, an analyst at Crisis Group, states, “There are no illusions in the region about Russia’s power. . . . No one wants to antagonize Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, besides Ukraine, Russian troops and military equipment are currently present in different contested territories across the former Soviet Union, including Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Transnistria, and Nagorno-Karabakh. Moscow continues to exert significant economic and political influence over Belarus, providing multimillion-dollar loans to the Lukashenko regime and using the country as a staging area for the Russian military. Furthermore, the Putin administration still enjoys sufficient economic and political influence across the countries of Central Asia, which continue to rely on Russia’s security assistance, remittance inflows, and export routes. Finally, in the case of the Baltic states, despite the efforts of local authorities to battle Moscow’s propaganda at home, news has emerged about a large-scale Russian disinformation campaign aimed at mimicking reputable European media outlets to disseminate pro-Kremlin interpretations of the Ukraine war across the European Union. Considering Moscow’s entrenched position among Russian minority groups in the Baltic states, such disinformation campaigns could further intensify tensions between the local governments and Russian-speaking communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that current Western sanctions continue to erode Moscow’s economic and geopolitical lifelines, limiting its ability to exert power in the broader region. Still, a politically and economically weakened Russia has managed to ignite and manipulate various ethnic tensions and conflicts in the post-Soviet era. Today, the Putin regime wants the world to know that despite sanctions, Russia’s capacity to control its sphere of influence should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release of the humanitarian policy serves exactly this purpose. By signing the decree into law, the Kremlin has made it crystal clear that it is buttressing the concept of Russkiy Mir — its nationalist narrative about Russia’s cultural, linguistic, and moral supremacy in the former Soviet Union. Already, the Security Council of the Russian Federation is discussing drafting a new language policy commensurate with the stated goals of the humanitarian policy, namely preservation and promotion of the Russian language against the backdrop of the ongoing “Westernization” of the world. According to Oleg Khramov, deputy secretary of the Security Council, creation of such a decree is necessary to “prevent further Latinization of the Russian society and preserve civilizational sovereignty” [emphasis added].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, the Putin regime wants the world to know that despite sanctions, Russia’s capacity to control its spheres of influence should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the humanitarian policy is part of a continuing effort by the Kremlin to claim that Russia is culturally distinct and separate from the West, furthering its view that the two are inevitable adversaries. Adding a cultural dimension to this conflict is also intended to help mobilize the Russian public and stoke nationalism against the West in support of a costly and possibly ruinous war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Putin’s Russia still has enough stamina to fight for its near abroad. The Kremlin is not yet backing off — indeed, it is doubling down. Accordingly, the West should be wary of Moscow’s revanchist tendencies in the post-Soviet bloc and remain on the alert for more trouble ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to reaping vast commercial rewards, nations with leading LEO broadband providers could enjoy increased resiliency in their communications, accuracy in positioning services, and even enhanced early warning capabilities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An elite group of companies, primarily from the United States and Europe, are on the cutting edge of these efforts. But China has its own plans for LEO broadband, deep pockets of state funding to pursue those ambitions, and political ties to leverage through its Belt and Road Initiative. As the LEO broadband competition intensifies, policymakers need an accessible guide to these developments and recommendations for advancing U.S. interests.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of November 2022, just over 63 percent of the 8 billion people in the world use the internet — leaving about 3 billion people (and potential customers) unconnected. To bridge this digital divide, governments and private commercial companies are investing in initiatives to build space-based broadband internet. If successful, these efforts have the potential to quickly connect people around the globe, as well as change the space environment itself. Several countries are launching national initiatives to establish low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations and capture large portions of a burgeoning market, unleashing extensive private- or state-backed resources to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition to provide broadband services from satellites is not new. The 1990s saw a similar commercial broadband internet boom that resulted in little success. Companies such as Teledesic, Celestri, Globalstar, Odyssey, and Iridium all proposed large satellite-communications (SATCOM) constellations in LEO, but almost all ended in bankruptcy by the early 2000s. As similar ambitions emerge 30 years later, will the new generation of LEO-based satellite broadband succeed? Today the barrier to entry to orbit has significantly decreased as technology, materials, and launch capabilities have become cheaper and more widely available. International competition to build, launch, and operate a low-cost and low-latency system that spans the globe is fierce, as the demand for fast, reliable, and affordable internet services continues to expand. As of 2022, only one operator, Starlink, is providing LEO-based service on the open market. High capital investment and extensive initial infrastructure requirements have slowed the commercialization of LEO broadband. However, this is set to change. Satellite broadband revenues have already increased by 1.1 percent in 2021, and global subscribers jumped by 11 percent — up to 3 million people — since the year prior. The global SATCOM market is estimated to grow to $40 billion by 2030, largely driven by LEO-based ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing a LEO constellation — a network of LEO-based satellites necessary for continuous global broadband delivery — involves substantial upfront investment, specialized technical know-how, and the ability to navigate a complex regulatory landscape. As international competition in LEO communications intensifies, it is imperative that the U.S. government creates an enabling (yet robust) regulatory environment for U.S.-based ventures to thrive at home and abroad. The government can also support U.S. companies, as well as the development of norms and standards, in key international coordinating bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States profits significantly — economically, militarily, and in global norms and standards setting — from its dominance in global networks, capturing 38 percent of industry revenue in 2021. There have been significant investments in a U.S.-serviced space-based internet, to include U.S commercial endeavors and separate proposed Department of Defense (DOD) efforts. However, allies and competitors alike are launching their own ventures in an increasingly contentious market: Telesat LightSpeed is based in Canada, and the newly merged Eutelsat/OneWeb is supported by both private funders in India and the UK government. Perhaps the greatest U.S. competitor in the race to global connectivity through satellite broadband is China. It has proposed a 13,000-satellite constellation in LEO to serve residential and business needs in the Chinese market, as well as to underdeveloped internet markets across the globe. Leveraging its state-owned enterprises (SOEs), public funding, and political and economic ties won through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China poses a real threat to U.S. dominance in this market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers in Washington and many allied nations now appreciate the risks that Chinese vendors pose in 5G networks, undersea cables, and other vital communications links. But they have yet to consider the economic and strategic implications of LEO satellite constellations, which promise to deliver quality and continuous coverage in underserved markets and bring more of the world online. In addition to reaping vast commercial rewards, nations with leading LEO broadband providers could enjoy increased economic benefits, resiliency, greater control over international communications networks, more accuracy in positioning services, enhanced early-warning capabilities, and potentially even greater intelligence access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following analysis examines the competition for satellite broadband, focusing on the interests of the United States and China. Beginning with a description of proposed satellite network constellations and their effects on the space environment, the paper will then examine U.S. interests in space, China’s planned satellite broadband efforts (and the competitive environment that may build), and the risks of operating large constellations in low Earth orbit. Finally, the authors will conclude with recommendations for specific actors, with an emphasis on U.S. government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;advantages-of-low-earth-orbit&quot;&gt;Advantages of Low Earth Orbit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellites are typically launched into one of three popular orbits: LEO at 160 to 2,000 kilometers (99 to 1243 miles), medium Earth orbit (MEO) at 2,000 to 35,786 kilometers (1243 to 22,236 miles), or geosynchronous orbit (GEO) at up to 42,164 kilometers (26,199 miles). All three orbits have varying advantages and challenges for satellites operating within them. For example, a constellation in GEO can have global coverage with only three satellites because of its distance from the Earth’s surface; GEO is popular for communications for this reason. However, because the satellites are so far away from Earth there is a longer period of latency — i.e., the time it takes for the signal to route to a satellite in GEO and back down to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iVNOr0x.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Popular Earth Orbits.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://aerospace.csis.org/aerospace101/earth-orbit-101/&quot;&gt;Thomas G. Roberts, “Popular Orbits 101,” CSIS, Aerospace Security, November 30, 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new generation of satellite internet suppliers are placing satellites in LEO instead of the traditional GEO for a multitude of reasons. Satellites launched into LEO are typically smaller and lighter than those in GEO, meaning that less fuel is required, and companies can place more satellites in orbit per launch for lower costs. Additionally, since LEO satellites are in relatively close proximity to Earth — between 160 and 2,000 kilometers (99 and 1243 miles) above the surface — user terminals can detect multiple satellites at once and connect with greater accuracy. Because LEO satellites are in constant motion, each satellite can only service a relatively small area on Earth at any given moment, so a large constellation of satellites is necessary to provide continuous global coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communications from LEO also experience a lower latency than satellites in GEO because they are so much closer to the Earth’s surface. LEO satellite operators tout that a web page can be opened around eight times faster when using LEO satellites than when using a traditional SATCOM system at GEO, something that has become more important to consumers who want to interact online in near-real time. This means that satellite internet needs to be capable of supporting high-throughput applications such as streaming, video conferencing, and real-time gaming. At the time of publication, LEO broadband constellations are capable of download speeds up to 250 megabits per second (Mbps), upload speeds of 30 Mbps, and latency of 25 milliseconds. This can be compared to cable internet, which in the United States can reach download speeds of up to 500 Mbps and upload speeds of 50 Mbps, with 100 milliseconds of latency. As more satellites are added to each constellation, these numbers will continue to improve for each respective provider. For nonstationary customers, such as airline travelers or maritime shipping vessels, LEO’s continuous coverage enables quicker and more reliable broadband than is currently provided through GEO- and MEO-based services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bridging-the-digital-divide-through-leo&quot;&gt;Bridging the Digital Divide through LEO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadband has proven to be a critical enabler for global “trade, employment, learning, leisure, and communications.” Access to the rapidly growing digital economy, which comprises roughly 15.5 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), can be transformational for previously unconnected and underdeveloped regions. The World Bank estimates that a 10 percent increase in broadband access can cause a 1.38 percent jump in GDP among low- and middle-income countries. Particularly in remote, hard-to-reach areas where building dedicated ground infrastructure is too expensive or simply not possible, LEO systems can provide quality internet connectivity to populations that are unreliably served by legacy technology. In the case of outages or gaps in service, such as during conflict or natural disaster, LEO constellations can boost the resiliency of communications networks and help fill the gaps in global connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For rural households across the globe, 63 percent of which do not have access to the internet as of 2020, satellite internet may be the only option for connectivity. Unlike other terrestrial forms of internet delivery, satellite terminals — receivers for space-based signals — require only a mostly unobstructed view of the sky and an electric connection. Current broadband services such as fiber optic cables, digital subscriber lines (DSL), or copper-based cable internet require extensive infrastructure (e.g., underground cable ducts or network tower construction) to become operational. The minimal and lower-cost ground-infrastructure requirements of satellite-based internet, coupled with LEO’s ability to provide broadband of a superior quality than other forms of satellite broadband (i.e., higher data rates with lower latency) makes LEO an extremely compelling solution for bridging gaps in the digital divide. Yet while there is great potential for space-based broadband, companies will need to improve quality, reliability, and affordability in order to meaningfully expand coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the barriers to entry and sustained operation are high, several operators throughout North America, Europe, and Asia are moving forward with LEO broadband plans. In the United States, SpaceX’s Starlink, Amazon’s Project Kuiper, and Boeing are expected to be top competitors in the market. In January 2015, Elon Musk, SpaceX’s CEO, first announced a $10-billion space internet plan. This service, now known as Starlink, would reportedly come online after five years and would be a revenue stream for SpaceX to pursue founding a city on Mars. As of November 2022, Starlink has launched over 3,500 satellites, all on SpaceX launch vehicles, and offers coverage in more than 50 markets across North America, South America, Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s Project Kuiper constellation has been in progress since 2019 and is expected to launch its first prototype satellites in early 2023, with the full constellation being implemented over the following five-year period. Named for the Kuiper Belt, a band of icy celestial bodies just beyond Neptune’s orbit, Kuiper is meant to be available to residential customers as well as an anchor for Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing. According to its operating license granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), half of Kuiper’s 1,618 satellite constellation must be launched by 2026, and the full constellation by 2029. In April 2022, Amazon announced landmark launch agreements with Arianespace, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance (ULA) for a total of 83 launches of Kuiper satellites over a period of five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Verizon and T-Mobile are testing telecommunications integration with LEO satellites to create more robust fifth-generation (5G) wireless services. This added competition from traditional terrestrial broadband providers will likely drive down prices in previously monopolized markets. In October 2021, Verizon and Project Kuiper announced a collaboration that would enable Project Kuiper satellites to “deliver backhaul solutions to extend Verizon’s 4G/LTE and 5G data networks, connecting rural and remote communities in the U.S.” In August 2022, SpaceX and T-Mobile announced a similar agreement that would enable next-generation Starlink satellites (to be launched in 2023) to communicate with cell phones consumers already own, theoretically eliminating dead zones in the T-Mobile cellular network. Customers could then call, text, and possibly stream videos without connection to a cell tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boeing has been publicly discussing investing in satellite internet since 2015, hoping to substantially increase internet capability while driving down the cost of satellite networks. After it failed to gain FCC approval for a 3,000-satellite LEO broadband constellation in 2017, an updated plan for a 147-satellite constellation was approved in 2021. This “V-band Constellation,” as it is called in its FCC application, would provide internet and communication services to the United States and its territories before expanding globally. The 147 satellites are to be broken down into LEO and GEO segments, with 132 satellites orbiting at 1,056 kilometers (656 miles) and 15 additional satellites orbiting between 27,355 and 44,221 kilometers (16,998 and 27,478 miles). According to its operating license granted by the FCC, half of the constellation must be launched by November 2027, and the rest by November 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telesat, established by the Canadian parliament in 1969, has continued to operate domestic satellite communications networks in the years since, even after the company officially separated from the Canadian government in 2008. Telesat announced its Lightspeed LEO constellation in 2016, creating a network of 188 satellites orbiting at 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) above Earth. Lightspeed does not aim to be a consumer broadband company but will instead market to cruise ships, airlines, and rural municipalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest publicly known plan for satellite broadband in Asia comes from China. Following the disintegration of two broadband constellation projects, China applied to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to operate a 12,992-satellite fleet in LEO in 2020. In early 2022, the local government of Shanghai entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with state-funded SatNet; in return for unknown support, SatNet will establish a space hub for the production of satellites and reusable launch vehicles in Shanghai. Additional details about the constellation have not been made public, but SatNet is to be a critical part of China’s political goal of being a leader in advanced technology across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, several would-be LEO operators have been forced to scale back their ambitions, declare bankruptcy, or seek drastic measures to keep afloat. UK-based LEO broadband start-up OneWeb filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020, only eight years after it was founded. Narrowly managing to escape default, the company received funding from the UK government and Bharti International, a large Indian conglomerate. Despite being one of the few firms close to bringing a product to market, having launched 66 percent (428 satellites) of its first constellation fleet and having received FCC permission to provide service in the United States, OneWeb struggled to attract the levels of investment it needed to stay afloat. In July 2022, the company merged with Eutelsat, a GEO satellite operator backed by French and Chinese funders, to bridge its growing financial gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar merger is expected to be finalized between U.S.-based GEO satellite operator ViaSat and UK-based satellite operator Inmarsat to deploy a constellation of 150 LEO satellites to join Inmarsat’s already established GEO network. This constellation, named Orchestra, will provide increased cybersecurity to government customers, integrate with 5G services, and improve the network’s latency, resiliency, and speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leo-economics&quot;&gt;LEO Economics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the LEO satellite internet industry is heavily concentrated among a few private sector companies and government-backed or -owned ventures. The high capital expenditure requirements for launching, maintaining, and manufacturing LEO constellations, along with the competition over finite spectrum resources and near-Earth orbital space contribute to the market having only a few major players. LEO constellations are expensive in both resources and time. Establishing a satellite constellation capable of global coverage — necessary for continuous broadband service in any one location — is a long-term endeavor. Furthermore, licensing and regulatory requirements are extensive and highly variable across different countries, leading to greater uncertainty and high compliance costs. Investing in LEO broadband is a long-term venture with many uncertainties and risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the business case for LEO broadband is strong. Global demand for connectivity remains high — and so does the demand for low latency and quality service. Rural areas are a key potential consumer base for satellite-broadband operators, and the quality promised by LEO-based constellations make them a favored avenue to satisfy demand. In the United States alone, 28 percent of rural households (roughly 4.8 million Americans) remain unconnected — but a MossAdams study reports that both subscribership and average revenue per user in U.S. rural areas are also on the rise. Other key consumer bases for LEO-based services include business-to-business (B2B) applications, nonstationary customers such as airlines and shipping conglomerates, and developing economies. Some LEO providers, Telesat and OneWeb included, are focusing entirely on B2B applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another difficulty for the LEO broadband business case is that it requires substantial and costly infrastructure: hardware and software for satellites, ground stations, secure launch vehicles, and space situational awareness (SSA), just to name a few. Every segment needs to successfully work together and provide a high-quality product for the business to draw in customers and make a return on investment. Because of the growing desire for worldwide connectivity, experts assess that a strong and growing market will reach a 20 percent compound annual growth rate by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the establishment of a LEO-based constellation, companies will be able to offer a range of services beyond simple connectivity, such as cloud computing, entertainment streaming, remote internet of things (IoT) applications, and government and military uses. Once high initial barriers to connectivity are satisfied, extending service offerings involves relatively low marginal costs. Indeed, operators are already exploring LEO-constellation applications beyond direct broadband delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector investment in space companies exceeded $10 billion in 2021, 60 to 70 percent of which is now directed into LEO-related ventures. Venture capitalists, encouraged by decreasing launch costs and the development of commercially viable applications, have also turned their attention toward space firms operating in LEO. While investment is increasing, current levels may not be enough to sustain a crowded industry due to the long-term nature of the LEO broadband enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building and operating large LEO constellations are incredibly complex and expensive, and today the industry is primarily driven by large companies with vast monetary reserves or by SOEs, a paradigm reinforced by structural and policy challenges. McKinsey estimates a $5 to $10 billion price tag for deploying an operational LEO satellite constellation. On top of that, recurring operating and maintenance costs are predicted to run companies $1 to $2 billion per year. In October 2022, Elon Musk said that the cost of the Starlink operation in Ukraine — including providing terminals and maintaining satellites and ground stations, among other expenditures — would reach $100 million by the end of the year. Though extenuating circumstances are driving this estimate up to much higher-than-average national operating costs, it is an example of the large funding necessary to maintain a successful and operational network in a time of crisis. High barriers to entry have resulted in the need for continuous and substantial investment financing for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEO constellations have the potential to reshape global networks, both those in orbit and on the ground. While reliant on the placement of numerous ground stations to extend service, the development of optical intersatellite links — communication channels that allow satellites within the same constellation to transfer data seamlessly between one another — will (when operational) further reduce the need for expensive ground infrastructure. Despite these advancements, one of the largest barriers to wide commercial adoption of LEO broadband services remains affordability. While end-user terminals allow communities to bypass the large infrastructure needs of traditional broadband delivery, production costs range anywhere from $1,000 for a home-use terminal to $10,000 for an airborne terminal (another potential market), making them prohibitively expensive for most customers in developing economies. Industry experts estimate the price of home terminals will be cut in half by the 2030s, with Amazon’s Project Kuiper already reporting terminal production costs will be under $500 per unit. Still, LEO satellite terminals are estimated to be approximately three times more expensive than GEO satellite terminals and seven times more expensive than traditional internet routers. Companies are likely to highly subsidize current and future terminals to incentivize adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high capital expenditures of manufacturing, launching, and maintaining a satellite constellation and its constituent parts require providers to charge high prices to recuperate these substantial early-stage investments. However, the average revenue per user in most developing markets is not currently high enough for companies to sustain operations. Instead, it is likely that select households will adopt and pay for these services, potentially driving the price down for expansion to underserved populations. Lack of access to broadband is heavily correlated with poverty, and the companies that can quickly decrease costs and meaningfully expand access to underserved populations could capture significant portions of the market share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-space-broadband-vision&quot;&gt;China’s Space Broadband Vision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s space sector has historically been dominated by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). As an SOE, CASC, along with its many subsidiaries, is tasked with the “research, design, manufacture, test and launch of ” all space-based activities. Only over the past 10 years has there been a slow emergence of space firms not solely government-owned or -operated. Document 60, a policy directive issued by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in 2014, unlocked a small portion of the space sector to private financing and created the first Chinese commercial space companies. A 2016 white paper called for increased “cooperation with private investors” on space, signaling a more relaxed approach to the restricted sector. It wasn’t until 2019 that an NDRC directive opened the majority of China’s nascent space economy to private investors at home and abroad. With broader permissions than allowed by Document 60, this directive prompted a significant shift in China’s space and satellite communications sector. That year, the country surpassed all but the United States in the number of space start-ups receiving funding, as well as in the amount of funding received, drawing 16 percent of total global investment in these ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting flood of capital led to a boom in Chinese space start-ups. As the sector matures, so will China’s capacity to grow and operationalize its space-based assets. According to an unclassified U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report, China doubled the number of satellites it has in orbit from 250 to 499 between 2019 and 2021. Accelerated by strong and well-communicated political will, that number is expected to grow quickly moving forward. Chinese auto manufacturer Geely, for example, is employing its deep manufacturing expertise to build a factory capable of producing 500 satellites per year by 2025. According to Euroconsult, more than $1.9 billion was invested into China’s commercial space companies between 2014 and 2020, half of which came from private capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s space sector and commercial capabilities have seen dramatic changes over the past 10 years. Bolstered by state resources and China’s extensive Digital Silk Road (DSR) initiative, Chinese LEO operators are well placed to provide service to a global market and pose a significant competitive threat to U.S. strategic and economic interests. Beijing start-up GalaxySpace launched several operational satellites in March 2022 that will eventually form a larger, multiconstellation, interconnected Chinese “National Network” of LEO communications, Earth observation, and navigation satellites. GalaxySpace intends to develop an integrated satellite/terrestrial 5G network via a 1,000-satellite constellation. ITU spectrum applications in 2020 show plans for an additional Chinese constellation consisting of 12,992 satellites, indicative of aims to develop a national network. Public ITU documents suggest this constellation, referred to as GuoWang or StarNet, will consist of two subconstellations capable of global broadband delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s attempt to deploy a national LEO broadband constellation enjoys significant support from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In 2020, China’s NDRC added satellite internet to its list of priority “new infrastructures,” signaling increased investment and support for the burgeoning commercial sector. Adopted in 2021, China’s 14th Five-Year Plan explicitly outlined the goal of establishing “a space infrastructure system for communication, navigation and remote sensing with global coverage and efficient operation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By allocating and directing resources toward competing enterprises, some of which are government-backed, China is developing a space sector capable of producing the infrastructure and expertise to support its vision for a national space-based internet. Shepherded by major CCP policy announcements and signals, the country’s LEO communications market has trended toward consolidation over the past two years. Investment, flowing hotly since the sector opened in 2019, is beginning to cool and concentrate on fewer firms. In April 2021, China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), the body responsible for oversight of China’s biggest SOEs, created China SatNet to manage the GuoWang constellation, blurring the lines between it being a government- or commercial-led service. SASAC’s direct creation and administration of SatNet places the company on the same level as China’s three national telecommunication companies, as well as the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) and CASC. Elevating SatNet to the level of the country’s most important SOEs likely grants the organization significant autonomy and expanded state support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASIC and CASC have each launched experimental satellites for their own LEO constellations — Hongyun and Hongyan, respectively — that aim to provide connectivity to China’s remote regions and to select maritime and air-travel customers. There is a significant chance that plans for both constellations will be absorbed by SatNet’s GuoWang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-competitive-advantage&quot;&gt;China’s Competitive Advantage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the country’s SOEs and its existing efforts under the DSR initiative, China could become an extremely robust competitor. China SatNet, along with CASIC’s and CASC’s LEO communications ventures, enjoys nearly unrestricted funding, municipal government support, and significant regulatory leeway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/R5E7vB0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Timeline of Select Chinese Policies on LEO Broadband.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following directives from the central government, municipal actors are heavily incentivized to invest in designated “strategic” sectors. For example, the city of Wuhan has committed to developing a local 100 billion yuan ($15.7 billion) space industry by 2025. In a bid to host the Chinese “valley of satellites,” Wuhan is offering millions in concessional financing to space companies. The city’s pledges, however, pale in comparison to those of China’s richer coastal regions. Taking advantage of this sentiment, SatNet executives have traveled to multiple cities in China attempting to court local leaders, receive regulatory concessions, and link SatNet with existing domestic industrial bases. The same day that Shanghai announced a flurry of new initiatives to grow the city’s space sector, local leaders signed a cooperation agreement with SatNet. Chongqing, host to the majority of CASC’s LEO Hongyan operations, has also signed a codevelopment agreement with SatNet for a new satellite industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic concessions at home are bolstered by China’s foreign engagement through the DSR and the Belt and Road Space Information Corridor, part of the broader BRI. China’s 2021 white paper on space referenced the Belt and Road Space Information Corridor as a key avenue through which to “strengthen cooperation on the application of . . . communication satellites.” Since 2016, China has signed over 117 space cooperation agreements and 19 memorandums of understanding with at least 37 foreign governments to share space-related infrastructure and build ground stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given China’s successful strategy of exporting terrestrial infrastructure through the DSR — up to 70 percent of 4G network infrastructure across Africa was built by Huawei — these agreements and engagements may significantly help the country achieve its aspiration of hosting a globally adopted LEO broadband service. With its heavy economic presence in many BRI countries, China is positioned to negotiate regulatory concessions for its national LEO system while discouraging the adoption of U.S. commercial services. A combination of diplomatic maneuvering, the bundling of hard infrastructure and digital services, and attractive pricing will likely make it difficult to compete with Chinese companies for market share in BRI countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dominance in foreign markets comes with benefits beyond economic gains. China’s heavy information and communication technology (ICT) presence in BRI countries creates path dependencies, spreads techno-authoritarian norms and standards, grows China’s voice in international governance and standards bodies, and strengthens China’s power over global networks. The successful proliferation of Chinese LEO broadband service could similarly boost China’s presence in foreign terrestrial networks, providing Beijing with greater control over international data flows and granting it extensive intelligence and coercive powers. China’s open push for civil-military integration suggests built-in dual-use capabilities in overseas BRI infrastructure. A planning document published by the State Council in 2016 reiterated China’s ambitions to establish satellite communications systems, linking them to the “development of military-civil fusion, in order to obtain global service capabilities as fast as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the role that LEO constellations will potentially play in communications networks, countries that permit Chinese ground stations and grant the country landing rights may find it less costly to continue adopting Chinese ICT technology. This digital dependency is fostered through exorbitant replacement costs and a reliance on a small set of vendors, often SOEs, that rate low on interoperability. High levels of dependency on Chinese-built and -operated digital infrastructure may lead to the default adoption of Chinese-crafted norms, standards, and data governance practices. Tanzania, a close BRI partner country, has modeled a subset of its data and cybersecurity laws after Beijing’s example leading to more restrictions on country’s social media landscape and information flows. Such adoption and regulatory alignment in turn reduces regulatory compliance costs for purchasing other Chinese-origin ICT technology. For countries such as Pakistan and Egypt, whose entire suite of digital infrastructure heavily features Chinese assets — from submarine cables and terrestrial fiber optic lines to 5G networks and satellite ground stations — the choice to integrate Chinese LEO broadband into existing network stacks will be a relatively easy one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-implications-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Security Implications for the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States holds an advantage in the competition over LEO broadband, as just under 50 percent of new companies seeking to operate in LEO originate in the country. But as China continues to further its ambitions for its own LEO broadband network, which may fall somewhere in the gray zone between commercial and governmental, the United States could lose its competitive edge. Furthermore, agreements through the DSR and the BRI could help China make inroads as the LEO broadband provider of choice in countries in Asia, South America, and Africa that do not currently have widespread internet infrastructure but do have good relationships with China. This could make burgeoning broadband markets reliant on Chinese services, leaving less room for U.S. manufacturers to provide service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also been known to block certain websites for citizens using domestic internet sources; Western applications such as Google Maps are not available on Chinese-built phones and networks, and often domestic apps can only be accessed by divulging privacy information or verifying one’s identity. If SatNet’s GuoWang constellation becomes the dominant broadband supplier, users could be blocked from accessing entire sections of the internet or expose personal and identifying data to network operators. This could further exacerbate the suppression or censorship of information in countries where there is already a widespread information vacuum or civil unrest. An infamous case of Chinese intelligence using BRI-built networks involves the African Union. Although officials have denied the allegations, for five years the African Union headquarters — paid, built, and wired by China — would send daily transmissions of confidential data to Beijing. Conversely, open connectivity can support citizens who need accessible information and communication channels, particularly in times of civil unrest when citizens need access to unrestricted, reliable services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing efficient and affordable broadband services based in LEO is not only a priority for privately funded industry but also for the U.S. military. From relaying massive amounts of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance data to detecting and tracking missiles to providing command, control, and communications for units in austere locations across the globe, the U.S. military’s demand for SATCOM continues to grow. The DOD has been working to build its own satellite broadband networks, the most public of which is the National Defense Space Architecture (NDSA) being designed by the Space Development Agency. The NDSA will consist of several layers of military constellations in LEO, each focusing on different aspects to enhance military connectivity, sensing, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to developing domestic military capability, the U.S. Space Force has shown interest in leveraging commercial services to increase the resiliency of military broadband networks and communications. The Space Force is currently working on a design to build a “space data backbone,” a service that will be able to integrate military, commercial, civil, and possibly allied networks. This access would follow a “fee for service” model wherein the Space Force would pay a fixed price to use a particular bandwidth over a fixed amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only will the U.S. military depend on advanced LEO broadband constellations for its own network operations, but LEO broadband is already being used — and targeted — on the battlefield in Ukraine. The Starlink terminals SpaceX sent have been used by the Ukrainian military and people alike, connecting a country whose other operating forms of communication were hacked and jammed in the initial days of the conflict — though SpaceX has had to devote additional funding and resources to protect the signals from attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leo-broadband-licensing&quot;&gt;LEO Broadband Licensing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years alone, the FCC has received applications for over 64,000 new satellites. For perspective, there are only 6,800 functioning satellites in orbit as of November 2022. Regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over space and space-related activities are struggling to keep pace with private sector growth in managing these constellations, a task that is correspondingly growing in difficulty. The rise of commercial space-based operations more broadly has forced new paradigms on a sector previously dominated by government and defense ventures, highlighting the need for updated regulation and an increase in capacity for the regulatory review process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Licensing requirements include allocating limited spectrum among a host of global actors, granting launch permissions, coordinating with international bodies, and managing orbital capacity and debris. In the United States, no single agency is responsible for overseeing these requirements; regulatory authority and review are unevenly split among the FCC, the DOD, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While not all the listed agencies are involved in regulating LEO broadband constellations in particular, coordination among agencies can be difficult, and shifting regulatory responsibilities slows progress and exacerbates issues resulting from varying levels of proficiency on space-related matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FCC regulates the frequencies that satellite constellations can use and, as such, is often the first stop for companies looking to begin operations. The commission, which has historically auctioned spectrum licenses on a first-come, first-served basis, is considering updating its auction rules for LEO-based satellite operators to ensure that operators licensed in earlier rounds have their spectrum access protected. The FCC, through its mandate to issue licenses “if public convenience, interest, or necessity will be served thereby,” has often gone beyond the direct regulation of spectrum use. The agency made headlines after it denied one operator a license for the launch of small satellites (11 x 11 x 2.8 cm) due to concerns the satellites would be too small for adequate tracking and SSA. Unable to keep pace with a rapidly evolving industry, the commission is planning to reorganize, potentially creating a new Space Bureau and an Office of International Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further complicate licensing for LEO constellations, satellite operators are not only regulated by their own governments but by global entities as well. Though approval for the design and launch of communications constellations first comes from the licensing authority of the corresponding government (e.g., the FCC in the United States), the only international regulatory body that approves satellites before launch is the ITU, part of the United Nations. The ITU — which includes two different member groups, composed of 193 countries and 900 private sector companies — is responsible for managing “the international coordination, notification and recording of the specific radio frequencies transmitted and received by satellites.” Because spectrum is a limited resource, the ITU process aims to establish impartial access while also limiting interference that may occur between satellite systems. Due to availability and other technical considerations, operators need to share certain spectrum bands with one another. The process for allocating spectrum is therefore extremely competitive. Representatives of the ITU member states license satellite systems, then file descriptions of the projects with the union, which shares the descriptions and findings with other member states. Prelaunch filings are made so that harmful interference between proposed projects can be resolved bilaterally between member states. Satellite filings are also required to be used within seven years from the date of the request or else the reserved spectrum is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the global nature of space, regulators also need to consider emerging and conflicting interests between U.S. firms and foreign competitors and between market incumbents and entrants. One of the largest bottlenecks to market dominance in LEO broadband is licensing: “The most difficult aspect of building a [low Earth orbit] broadband system is acquiring the spectrum, not building and launching satellites,” according to Quilty Analytics. For U.S. companies that compete against foreign firms facing different national regulatory structures, requirements, and enforcement capabilities, comparatively stringent domestic requirements are costly and dampen U.S. firms’ first-mover advantage. Additionally, regulations regarding landing rights, ground stations and related infrastructure, and market access vary significantly by country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High compliance costs notwithstanding, competition from national telecommunication companies and domestic LEO ventures in host countries is fierce. Domestic companies looking to defend their market share often lobby their governments to implement protectionist policies masquerading as regulatory requirements. For example, SpaceX’s attempt to expand Starlink service into India was strongly opposed by OneWeb, a firm with substantial investment from Indian conglomerate Bharti Enterprises. Eventually, SpaceX’s attempts to secure the necessary licenses stalled, and the company had to halt presales in the region. Some countries forbid foreign ownership over telecommunications infrastructure outright, forcing entrants to set up joint ventures with domestic firms or open locally owned and operated companies as a prerequisite for market access. Conversely, the FCC Satellite Division often grants permission for U.S. market access to commercial satellites licensed by other countries. There is a risk that asymmetric requirements between U.S. license holders and foreign-licensed companies with permission to operate in the United States may create an uneven playing field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, staff shortages, a more complicated operating environment, multiple processing rounds, and poorly defined deadlines have elongated license approval timelines for satellite licenses. Since LEO constellations involve many rapidly evolving technologies, by the time licenses are granted, the subjects of those licenses risk becoming obsolete. The pace of development in related technology often means that licenses, once granted, must be updated to reflect new advancements. This, in turn, slows down government review. Long licensing timelines across the entire space sector delay the process of bringing a product to market, resulting in market uncertainty and lower profit projections that dampen sector growth. Navigating an onerous regulatory process — while also facing narrow profit margins and unforgiving business models of LEO broadband systems — can make it impossible for all but the largest, most well-resourced companies to obtain licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-large-leo-constellations&quot;&gt;Managing Large LEO Constellations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risks-and-operator-mitigation&quot;&gt;Risks and Operator Mitigation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As increased opportunities emerge in LEO, so do the risks — not only due to international competition but also due to the unforgiving space environment itself. The space domain is becoming more diverse, disruptive, disordered, and dangerous as more countries and companies begin to operate there. When looking at proposed LEO broadband networks, risks can include — but are not limited to — on-orbit collisions in space, disruptions to astronomy missions, and political discord between nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest risks associated with the launch of large constellations is to the space environment itself; an increase in the number of satellites in orbit increases the potential for collisions. As of November 7, 2022, there have been about 14,450 satellites launched into Earth orbit. About 9,610 of these satellites are still in space — of which 6,800 are still functioning. Government-conducted destructive anti-satellite (ASAT) tests have significantly contributed to debris creation, and upper-stage rocket bodies left in orbit have fragmented into thousands of large debris objects. These activities have created over 27,000 pieces of trackable debris being monitored by DOD’s Space Surveillance Network — not including pieces that are too small to detect. These high-velocity pieces of “space junk” make operating in the space environment more dangerous, and the possibility of a collision increases the more objects enter orbit. SpaceX alone has requested FCC authorization for another 30,000 satellites (it has received authorization for 7,500 of the 30,000 as of December 2022). OneWeb, Amazon, Telesat, and China SatNet constellation plans are similarly in the thousands. Together, proposed LEO broadband constellations could potentially add over 90,000 satellites into Earth orbit, vastly changing the operational domain. In April 2021, reports surfaced that SpaceX and OneWeb had an alleged close approach between their respective satellites. There was no collision, and both companies have differing opinions on the risk their satellites faced. However, a significant increase in satellites orbiting in LEO could restrict additional space activities, including impacting future human spaceflight and launch schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starlink satellites have SSA capabilities on board and can perform avoidance maneuvers autonomously based on the satellite’s knowledge of its current position and information about potential close approaches. These capabilities have already proven to be necessary; Starlink satellites have reportedly had to maneuver over 1,700 times to avoid orbital debris from Russia’s 2021 ASAT test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although no satellites from the Project Kuiper constellation are currently in orbit, space safety and sustainability have been emphasized throughout Amazon’s design process. Project Kuiper satellites will have active propulsion systems on board and be programmed to perform avoidance maneuvers if the risk of collision is estimated to be more than 1 in 100,000. Additionally, the constellation’s low altitude will increase the ability for satellites to be deorbited faster and more reliably. Kuiper satellites are scheduled to actively deorbit within one year of a completed mission and, if this fails, will naturally deorbit within 10 years. Satellites will have be held to a tight orbital tolerance, the distance in which a satellite can move in orbit, of within 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) to avoid overlapping with other large LEO systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OneWeb also has an SSA component via an agreement with LeoLabs to incorporate its Collision Avoidance service. This agreement adds another layer of operational safety to OneWeb satellites, allowing the on-orbit systems to receive real-time data regarding the location of space debris and other satellites. This LeoLabs service is also used by SpaceX and the Earth imaging company Planet, which operates a 200-satellite Earth-observation fleet. In addition to the LeoLabs software, OneWeb satellites incorporate sustainable components, such as grappling fixtures and a magnetic docking plate so they can be deorbited or serviced in an active debris removal mission if necessary. Because the satellites were designed in France, the fleet also is ready to comply with the France Space Operation Act, which mandates that all LEO satellite operators deorbit satellites at the close of their operational activity. In October 2022, Iridium, OneWeb, and SpaceX released a set of “Satellite Orbital Safety Best Practices” through the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics to “guide and improve cooperative operations in space.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another risk to the space environment is the potential for satellites to interfere with astronomical observations. Astronomers have raised concerns that Starlink satellites have disrupted night-sky observations, blocking or interrupting telescope images, with the potential for further disruptions as more satellites from additional operators are launched into orbit. Environmental groups in France have been so vocal about this subject — as well as the pollution caused by launches — that Starlink’s permit to operate in the country was temporarily overturned. Starlink competitor ViaSat has also criticized the vast Starlink fleet’s obstructions to astronomy and has filed court documents to stop it from launching more satellites based on environmental grounds, though this has not been successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to concerns, both Telesat and SpaceX have been working with the astronomy community to decrease the reflectivity of their satellites. Telesat CEO Dan Goldberg reported that its satellites would be kept to a smaller constellation and will orbit at a higher altitude to ensure Telesat is a responsible user of the space domain. SpaceX has published details on the work it has undertaken to mitigate impacts to astronomy and has signed coordination agreements with the National Science Foundation to further collaborate on solutions. Changes to both the design and operation of the Starlink constellation have resulted in improvements to the brightness of satellites, mitigating the effect on astronomical observations. Amazon is also working with the National Science Foundation and the American Astronomical Society to incorporate astronomers’ concerns into current prototype plans. According to an interview with the company, Project Kuiper is limiting the number of satellites in its constellation and choosing an operating altitude with an eye toward sustainability and convenience, in keeping with best practices recommended by astronomers and industry. However, there is no permanent solution for astronomers using Earth-based telescopes. This challenge highlights a significant gap in the international regulatory system for space, as one country’s approvals of constellations can affect people all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the space domain itself, intense broadband competition also carries a political dimension. A researcher in a Chinese peer-reviewed journal wrote about the threat Starlink’s spread posed to Chinese assets, that the country should “adopt a combination of soft and hard kill methods to disable some of the Starlink satellites and destroy the constellation’s operating system.” Though the paper was taken down shortly after publishing, this sentiment is not unique in China. An opinion piece published in the Chinese military’s official news site, China Military Online, wrote about Starlink’s “unchecked expansion” and alleged it had an “ambition to use it [the system] for military purposes” that should alarm governments worldwide. There has been no documented concern from Chinese media about the threats a domestic constellation may also pose to global space assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trajectories of Starlink’s satellites have continued to draw political attention, most vocally from China. In two separate events in July 2020 and October 2021, Chinese officials claimed Starlink satellites came so close to the Tiangong space station that astronauts had to shelter in place. Chinese officials issued a complaint to the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs, to which the United States replied on January 28, 2022, refuting claims that Starlink satellites endangered the crewed space station and that the satellites involved “did not meet the threshold of established emergency collision criteria.” While this issue has not been formally concluded, it is a potent reminder that the accurate tracking of space objects will be crucial in supporting or disputing similar claims in the future. Additionally, China does not currently publish the Tiangong space station’s planned maneuvers, unlike the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) does with the International Space Station, which could facilitate operator planning and coordination. This incident underscores the importance of having open avenues of communication as well as shared standards and data among all operators in the space domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEO systems have the potential to play a role in geopolitical competition with other competitors as well. A large shift in the geopolitical relationship between the United States and Russia, the two longest-standing space powers, took place after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. OneWeb had a launch of 36 satellites planned for March 4, 2022, from the Russian-operated Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, just a week after the invasion of Ukraine. Operations at Baikonur were immediately halted in late February, impacting the satellites OneWeb had sent to be launched by a Soyuz rocket. As of November 2022, the 36 satellites remain in Russia and have not been returned to OneWeb, which reported a $229 million loss after the incident. Looking for another provider, OneWeb turned to SpaceX, which operates competitor Starlink, to continue satellite launches to complete OneWeb’s constellation. This is not the first time SpaceX has launched satellites for a competitor: its Falcon 9 rockets launched upgrades for an Iridium communications constellation until 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Ukrainian officials issued a plea on Twitter at the onset of the Russian invasion of the country, Elon Musk pledged tens of thousands of Starlink user terminals to aid in connectivity around the country in March 2022. Furthermore, The New York Times reported that Ukrainian forces were using Starlink terminals to send targeting information to artillery and communicate with reconnaissance drones. Starlink’s involvement in the conflict opens the door to questions about commercial companies’ involvement in zones of geopolitical conflict and what risks this poses to their assets. Days after civilian Starlink services were established in Ukraine, Musk reported on Twitter that Russian forces had jammed user-terminal access. He further stated that the company had pushed out software updates to its assets to harden them against further attacks. The additional connections involved in operating a large LEO constellation increase the system’s vulnerability to cyberattacks or even jamming. Cyber connections need to be hardened and encryption increased to ensure communications are safe and not tampered with. However, this would likely come at a higher cost and add latency to the network. Commercial companies should be aware of what this risk management would cost and adapt their security if more instances of malware attacks are made public. Because commercial LEO broadband companies may be operational in conflict zones or support national-security missions, their systems will likely continue to be targets for electronic warfare or cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of U.S. private sector companies has led to cost reductions in launch services and satellite manufacturing and rapidly increased the pace of innovation in the space domain, all of which have led to the successful reemergence of space-based broadband operators. SpaceX is the first company to commercialize its LEO broadband constellation, allowing U.S. actors to take the lead in setting emerging standards, norms, and best practices. However, foreign competitors are close behind. U.S. government agencies can support and encourage — or, at a minimum, not hinder — commercial activity, uphold sustainability requirements for an increasingly congested orbit, and facilitate U.S. commercial growth, particularly in the broadband internet domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common thread is that regulatory clarity, speed, and reform at the FCC will have an enormous impact as commercial competition intensifies. As the FCC continues to play the dominant role in regulating satellite communications, it should take care to strike the appropriate balance between burdensome regulation and market development. Providing additional clarity and establishing defined approval timelines, adhering to deadlines on public comment periods, and opening communication channels with commercial companies submitting licensing requests are a few ways it can achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help address these issues, the FCC announced in November 2022 that it would open a new space bureau under its current International Bureau to improve commercial marketplace relations. The chairwoman of the FCC, Jessica Rosenworcel, conceded that the agency had not kept up with the rapid changes in the commercial space domain and stated that this office will “support the United States leadership and the emerging space economy, promote long term technical capacity to address satellite policies[,] and improve our coordination with other agencies on these issues.” At the time of publication, there is no timeline in place for this office to be fully functional, but assembling it should be a priority so that it can establish interagency communication and commercial market coordination as more companies launch their constellations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the FCC can increase coordination with international governing bodies. The regulations to which competing broadband companies are subject to can vary greatly, and U.S. companies may be held to unique standards that others in orbit are not. While the FCC and other regulatory bodies must maintain integrity in the regulatory process, it will only become more critical to coordinate with international partners to establish shared standards for operation in the space domain. The ITU could be a key partner for the United States and FCC in promoting common international norms and standards regarding shared spectrum. This can discourage dishonesty from actors with unclear motives in reserving spectrum and help identify deceptive actions by large actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Department of Commerce becomes more involved in the space domain, its SSA mission area will continue to increase in importance and affect every aspect of space. Increased SSA capabilities can include tracking even smaller debris, and current capabilities can successfully monitor objects 10 centimeters or larger, which would help create a more accurate picture of the operating environment for satellite operators around the globe. Ensuring that SSA data is widely accessible and that different tracking organizations’ standards are similar can provide clarity and consistency for an increasingly congested domain. Because broadband operators of LEO constellations will have larger numbers of satellites than ever before, accurate SSA will be integral to the successful and sustainable operation of these networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should also emphasize interacting with the international community to establish shared norms of operation for space systems in orbit, starting with operators in LEO. By creating widely adopted rules of operation, the United States can be a leader in the domain and make it easier to identify abnormal, potentially nefarious behavior. Global operating standards can also emphasize space sustainability, protecting various orbital regimes from space debris and ensuring that others will still be able to use the domain in years to come. These norms could potentially expand to include reciprocal regulations, which would make it easier for satellite operators to operate in multiple countries at once. International regulatory agencies could even work together to simplify license applications, potentially even creating a joint license application where one application could be used to apply to many countries at once. This could simplify standards for commercial companies and shift the speed at which licenses are approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, U.S. leaders should aim to increase soft power across the globe by working with commercial companies that can successfully operate broadband internet constellations and incorporate connectivity. The United States has a strong record of projecting soft power through space exploration, namely through NASA programs that have captivated the globe for decades. NASA has over 700 international agreements with more than 100 countries around the world, allowing the United States to maintain strong relationships with foreign governments through civil space agencies at times when collaboration may not be possible in other parts of government. The emergence of a strong U.S. commercial space sector that offers individual services extends the country’s possible reach — but it could lose this strategic soft power if China is able to leverage its current BRI networks to implement SatNet in developing regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the United States profits significantly from its dominance in global networks, and U.S.-based commercial satellite networks have a significant head start. But as the race for space-based communication networks intensifies, it is important that the United States government enact policies and incentives to keep U.S. companies competitive internationally. Even once firms have accumulated the vast capital and expertise required for entry into the LEO broadband market, they face high compliance costs and uncertainty in navigating multilevel regulatory regimes. Licensing requirements persist through domestic, foreign, and international processes, which are at times opaque, unaligned, and unevenly applied, as regulators may not be keeping pace with industry’s rate of innovation. Striking the right balance between appropriate regulation and market development is a perennial problem, one that should be reckoned with in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing competition in the race to establish space-based broadband networks carries many risks to a rapidly growing space domain. These include environmental, technical, and political risks, not to mention the challenge posed by looming international competition from China. Beijing has its own plans for a national LEO broadband network that benefits from extensive state funding and the political support gained through its BRI. Leveraging its heavy economic presence in a large portion of BRI countries, China is positioned to negotiate regulatory concessions for its LEO system while discouraging the adoption of U.S. commercial services. A combination of diplomatic maneuvering, the bundling of hard infrastructure and digital services, and attractive pricing will likely make it difficult to compete with Chinese companies for market share in BRI countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, U.S. companies often face protectionist barriers and a complex regulatory landscape when looking to expand into foreign markets. Requirements regarding landing rights, ground stations and related infrastructure, and market access vary significantly by country. Future regulatory changes need to consider competition between domestic market incumbents and new entrants as well. As U.S. government agencies begin to regulate the thousands of SATCOM satellites that will be launched into LEO in the next five to ten years, they will need to establish shared norms of operation for on-orbit space systems, more clearly convey licensing standards and practices, and communicate heavily with both domestic commercial companies and the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

Azu International Ltd Sti described itself as a wholesale trader of IT products, and a week later began shipping U.S. computer parts to Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business was brisk, Russian customs records show. The United States and the EU had recently restricted sales of sensitive technology to Russia because of its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, and many Western tech companies had suspended all dealings with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-founded by Gokturk Agvaz, a Turkish businessman, Azu International stepped in to help fill the supply gap. Over the next seven months, the company exported at least $20 million worth of components to Russia, including chips made by U.S. manufacturers, according to Russian customs records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jJTpdwI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ The LinkedIn profile of Gokturk Agvaz, Azu International’s co-founder. Agvaz recently sold his stake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azu International’s rapidly growing business didn’t come from a standing start, Reuters reporting shows: Agvaz manages a wholesaler of IT products in Germany called Smart Impex GmbH. Before the invasion, Russian custom records show that the German company shipped American and other products to a Moscow customer that recently has imported goods from Azu International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reached at his office near Cologne in October, Agvaz told Reuters that Smart Impex stopped exporting to Russia to comply with EU trade restrictions but sells to Turkey, a non-EU country that doesn’t enforce most of the West’s sanctions against Moscow. “We cannot export to Russia, we cannot sell to Russia, and that’s why we just sell to Turkey,” he said. Asked about Azu International’s sales to Russia, he replied, “This is a business secret of ours.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contacted again shortly before publication, Agvaz said Smart Impex “observes all export restrictions and manufacturer bans” and “has not circumvented Western sanctions against Russia.” He said he couldn’t answer questions about Azu International. Turkish corporate records show he sold his 50% interest in the Istanbul company on Nov. 30 to his co-founder, Huma Gulum Ulucan. She couldn’t be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azu International is an example of how supply channels to Russia have remained open despite Western export restrictions and manufacturer bans. At least $2.6 billion of computer and other electronic components flowed into Russia in the seven months to Oct. 31, Russian customs records show. At least $777 million of these products were made by Western firms whose chips have been found in Russian weapons systems: America’s Intel Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc and Analog Devices Inc., and Germany’s Infineon AG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6OTBJFg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Azu International, founded in March of this year, describes itself as a wholesale trader in IT products. Its offices are inside this business center in Istanbul.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A joint investigation by Reuters and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a London-based defense think tank, details for the first time the global supply chain that continues to feed Russia with Western computer components and other electronics. The investigation into this trade identified a galaxy of obscure importers and exporters, like Azu International, and found that shipments of semiconductors and other technology continue to arrive in Russia from Hong Kong, Turkey and other trading hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Russian importer, OOO Fortap, based in St. Petersburg, was set up by a Russian businessman in April and has since imported at least $138 million worth of electronics, including U.S. computer parts, according to Russian customs records. They show that one of Fortap’s biggest suppliers is a Turkish company, Bion Group Ltd Sti, a former textile trader that recently expanded into wholesale electronics. Bion’s general manager declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Russian importer, OOO Titan-Micro, registered an address that’s a house in a forest on the northern edge of Moscow. It, too, has imported Western computer components since the invasion, according to the customs records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the suppliers – including firms in Hong Kong and Turkey – have ties to Russian nationals, according to a review of company filings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zR1MGCZ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Logos of firms whose products have been shipped to Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customs records – which Reuters purchased from three commercial providers – don’t identify the precise type of semiconductors and other electronic products, nor do they show what happens to the components once they arrive in Russia. Reuters reported in August that Western companies’ mass-produced chips, in many cases not subject to export restrictions, have shown up inside missiles and weapons systems the Russian military has deployed in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters provided to Intel, AMD, Texas Instruments, Analog Devices and Infineon data from Russian customs records that detail shipments of their products that have arrived in Russia in recent months. Reuters excluded data between Feb. 25 and March 31 to account for shipments that might have been in transit before the invasion or before the manufacturers’ announced suspensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Intel said the company is taking the findings “very seriously and we are looking into the matter.” The spokesperson said Intel adheres to all sanctions and export controls against Russia and “has a clear policy that its distributors and customers must comply with all export requirements and international laws as well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a spokesperson for AMD said the firm “strictly complies” with all export regulations and has suspended sales and support for its products in Russia. “That includes requiring all AMD customers and authorized distributors” to stop selling AMD products into Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infineon, too, said that after the invasion, it “instructed all distribution partners globally to prevent deliveries and to implement robust measures that will prevent any diversion of Infineon products or services contrary to the sanctions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fn2VQ0k.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A Texas Instruments chip, dated 1988, is seen on the circuit board of a Russian 9M727 missile. The missile was recovered from the battlefield in Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas Instruments said it has not shipped to Russia since the end of February. Analog Devices didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Commerce said, “Since the start of the invasion, Russia’s access to semiconductors from all sources has been slashed by nearly 70 percent thanks to the actions of the unprecedented 38 nation coalition that has come together to respond to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s aggression. It is no surprise that Russia is working hard to circumvent controls.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Reuters review of Russian customs data found that since the invasion, the declared value of semiconductor imports by Russia has, in fact, risen sharply. The spokesperson said the Commerce Department had analyzed different data and therefore couldn’t comment on Reuters findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s office and Russia’s Ministry of Industry and Trade didn’t respond to requests seeking comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stacks-of-boxes&quot;&gt;Stacks of boxes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the firms shipping Western technology to Russia is a Hong Kong- registered company called Pixel Devices Ltd. A Reuters journalist who visited Pixel Devices’ office in a Hong Kong business tower found a small room with cardboard boxes stacked to the ceiling, and no employees. There was little sign that the company has shipped at least $210 million in electronics to Russia since April 1, including at least $50 million in Intel and AMD products through Oct. 31, according to Russian customs records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company records show that Pixel Devices was incorporated in 2017 by a Hong Kong firm called Bigfish Investments Ltd, controlled by Kirill Nosov, a Hong Kong resident with a Russian passport. Nosov told Reuters in an email that he helped set up the firm but doesn’t work for it and isn’t in a position to comment about its activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixel Devices’ current owner is a Singapore company, Asia Global Neolink Pte Ltd, which in turn is owned by a Seychelles company called White Wings Ltd, according to Hong Kong and Singapore company records. Pixel Devices’ only director at present is Pere Roura Cano, a Spaniard, who is also listed as a director of Asia Global Neolink and runs an aviation club in Catalonia. Reached by telephone in Spain, Roura Cano confirmed that Pixel Devices has been shipping semiconductors and other products to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We ourselves increase the risks of sanctions by publicly reporting on who will carry what and from where … Such publicity attracts unnecessary attention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m beginning with these people and I’m not sure what goods are moving,” he said. “I cannot inform you more; it’s our private activity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixel Devices’ website, www.pixel-devices.com, was originally registered in 2017 with a web-services firm in St. Petersburg, according to internet intelligence firm DomainTools. The website states that Pixel Devices’ “Components &amp;amp; Subassemblies” division serves businesses in diversified sectors including military and aerospace. In response to questions from Reuters, Pixel Devices said it doesn’t sell products to the military sector and prohibits its customers from reselling to defense companies. It said some of the information on the website is “quite outdated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixel Devices said it has been supplying IT equipment to Russia for several years and “it is possible” that it shipped Intel and AMD products this year “as part of long-term contracts.” It said it acquires its products from manufacturers or their resellers and doesn’t supply components “that violate any binding policies imposed on the company by its partners, vendors, or distributors.” Intel and AMD told Reuters that Pixel Devices isn’t an authorized distributor of their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ A screenshot of an English version of KompLiga’s website, compliga.ru. The firm, a supplier of IT products, is in St. Petersburg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixel Devices said it couldn’t confirm the accuracy of the values found by Reuters of the company’s exports of electronics to Russia; it didn’t provide its own figures. It also noted that export restrictions aren’t universal and there isn’t a complete ban on the export of IT equipment to Russia. The company said it doesn’t sell to entities controlled by sanctioned individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixel Devices also said it’s not surprising that no one was in Pixel Devices’ office recently because most employees work remotely or in warehouse operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian customs records show that Pixel Devices’ main client in Russia is a company in St. Petersburg called OOO KompLiga. Its website, states that the firm can supply a wide range of IT products and parts. According to the customs records, since April 1, KompLiga has imported at least $181 million worth of electronics, almost exclusively from Pixel Devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KompLiga’s general manager, Aleksandr Kotelnikov, told Reuters he was reluctant to provide details on how his company manages to continue procuring Western electronic components. “I’d rather not disclose details about my company’s work so as not to tip off rivals and give them a helping hand in their hard work,” Kotelnikov wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iron-curtain&quot;&gt;“Iron curtain”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every Russian company is reluctant to discuss how to deal with export restrictions. A Moscow-based logistics firm, OOO Novelco, has been advising Russian businesses on how to continue importing foreign goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September, Novelco organized a seminar in Moscow for its clients on “how to find alternative ways to deliver goods” to Russia. In a 45-minute presentation entitled “Foreign trade tactics and strategies to compensate for sanctions,” Novelco’s chief executive, Grigory Grigoriev, urged companies to stockpile products and develop diversified pools of suppliers from more than one country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Novelco executive offered a tip for clients tempted to use the Chinese territory of Macau as a shipping point to Russia: “We do not recommend sending cargo through this airport, despite the attractive rates, as there are enormous waiting times, cancellations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To resolve shipping problems, he and other Novelco executives have recommended on the company’s YouTube channel using lessons learned during the pandemic, such as transporting goods through third countries, rather than directly from a supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In interviews with Russian media and in a series of posts on LinkedIn, Grigoriev described recent trade restrictions on Russia as tantamount to erecting an “iron curtain” around his country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rDbXXsk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A video presentation by the CEO of Novelco, a Russian logistics firm, offering advice on how to cope with sanctions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grigoriev said in one LinkedIn post that Novelco had set up an affiliate in Istanbul and has been shipping goods to Russia from Turkey, which doesn’t enforce all U.S. and EU Russian trade restrictions. Once merchandise arrives in Turkey, “shipments are processed for re-export and cargo can follow to Russia by air, sea, road and rail transport,” Grigoriev said in the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, Grigoriev registered in Istanbul a company called Smart Trading Ltd Sti, Turkish corporate records show. Since then, the company has shipped at least $660,000 worth of products made by U.S. semiconductor makers, according to Russian customs records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other Russian firms believe it is unwise to discuss publicly how to handle trade restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an August blog post, a senior executive at F+ tech, a Russian IT equipment manufacturer that relies on many imported components, said the business of procuring foreign parts requires discretion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We ourselves increase the risks of sanctions by publicly reporting on who will carry what and from where,” Evgeny Krivosheev, F+ tech’s head of production and development, wrote in a blog post, which was published by Russian business daily Vedomosti and on the company’s website. “Such publicity attracts unnecessary attention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Krivosheev’s company said the executive wasn’t speaking about any particular firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eu-shipments&quot;&gt;EU shipments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many recent shipments of Western computer parts to Russia have arrived from China and other countries that haven’t joined the United States and the EU in restricting exports to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are some exceptions, Reuters found. Customs records show shipments of Analog Devices and other U.S. components directly from the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elmec Trade Oü, an electronic-components wholesaler based in the Estonian capital Tallinn, shipped at least $17 million worth of goods to Russia between April 1 and Oct. 31, according to Russian customs records. These included chips made by Analog Devices and other U.S. manufacturers, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elmec Trade’s general manager, Aleksandr Fomenko, told Reuters that his company buys its products through official channels, follows all legal requirements and complies with all sanctions and export restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked how his company could continue to export Analog Devices and other Western chips months after the manufacturers announced they had suspended sales to Russia, he said that “the majority” were orders placed last year. The shipments were delayed because of pandemic-related transit disruptions, he said. Analog Devices didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the European Commission didn’t respond to questions about Elmec Trade. In general, the spokesperson said, “The EU takes circumvention very seriously, as it is a practice that can undermine the effectiveness of EU sanctions.” The spokesperson noted that the 27-member bloc has been encouraging other countries to align with EU measures adopted against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eleventh-floor&quot;&gt;Eleventh floor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has placed export restrictions on scores of companies to try to stop the flow of sensitive high-tech components to Russia. But the probe by Reuters and RUSI found that there appears to be an active roster of substitute players ready to replace such entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the case of AO GK Radiant, a Moscow-based distributor of computer chips and other electronic parts that celebrated its thirtieth anniversary in June. It states on its website that its objective is to provide Russian clients with “the best solutions from global manufacturers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Russian customs records show for years the company had imported millions of dollars worth of Western-designed chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in July 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce added the company to its trade restrictions list, alleging that it was “involved in the procurement of U.S.-origin electronic components likely in furtherance of Russian military programs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian customs records show that GK Radiant’s imports have since plummeted. The company’s founder, Andrei Kuznetsov, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company’s head office remains on the eleventh floor of a building at 65 Profsoyuznaya Street in Moscow. There also appears to be another importer of Western computer components operating on the same floor. It’s called Titan-Micro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/w5KzpA0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image9&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ The house in northern Moscow where IT electronics distributor OOO Titan-Micro is registered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian customs records show that Titan-Micro began importing Analog Devices and other electronic components in November 2021, nine months after it was established. Titan-Micro has since imported at least $12.7 million in parts, including $9.9 million worth since April 2022. It has used some of the same suppliers as GK Radiant, including Sinno Electronics Co Ltd, a Chinese company that was placed under export restrictions by the U.S. Department of Commerce in June for allegedly providing support to Russia’s defense sector. Sinno Electronics didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The address for Titan-Micro listed in Russian corporate records leads to a wooden house, deep inside a birch forest in northern Moscow, with no apparent sign of business activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company’s general manager, Nadejda Shevchenko, hung up when Reuters reached her by phone. But a Titan-Micro employee, who declined to give his name, later said employees weren’t working at the wooden house, but on the 11th floor of the business center at 65 Profsoyuznaya Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where GK Radiant also operates.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steve Stecklow, et al.</name></author><summary type="html">In March this year, a new firm appeared in Turkey’s corporate registry.

This phenomenon has immediately and severely affected thousands of Africans subjected to violence. The growing Salafi-jihadi base in Africa also supports a global movement waging war on the US and many of its allies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;African groups may become more direct participants in global jihad as they develop capabilities that they can use overseas. Every Salafi-jihadi group that has attacked transnationally began with a local focus; past examples show that groups can rapidly pivot to transnational attack plotting when circumstances shift. As African Salafi-jihadi groups continue to develop more advanced military and nonmilitary capabilities, they stand to provide even greater benefits to the global Salafi-jihadi movement in terms of recruits, money, propaganda, innovation, leadership, and safe havens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This report considers the capabilities, resources, and opportunities that can be used to assess the relative strength of a Salafi-jihadi group in terms of its sophistication, effectiveness, and resilience. This framework aims to facilitate comparing groups at different stages of development, tracking changes in their capacity over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The analysis in this report points to a necessary rethink in US policy to counter the Salafi-jihadi movement. The United States’ counterterrorism policy is missing the opening to stop Salafi-jihadi insurgencies from forming and becoming entrenched. Policymakers should reform US foreign assistance and expand intelligence coverage to prioritize conflict prevention and resolution. A long-term solution requires reducing the overall level of capability, resourcing, and opportunity available to the Salafi-jihadi movement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Qaeda and the Islamic State are rising in Africa. The Salafi-jihadi movement has long-standing connections to the continent, exemplified by the participation of North African mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 1980s and al Qaeda’s operations in East Africa in the 1990s. The global crackdown on al Qaeda’s networks in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks compounded setbacks for the movement, briefly reversing its progress on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the past decade has been a period of clear expansion marked by the exponential growth of rank-and-file membership and increases in the number of active Salafi-jihadi organizations and their territorial reach in Africa. (See the sidebar.) This phenomenon has immediately and severely affected thousands of Africans subjected to violence. But not only Africans have a stake in beating back this jihadist expansion. The growing Salafi-jihadi base in Africa supports a global movement waging war on the US and many of its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several Salafi-jihadi groups in sub-Saharan Africa are advancing as Western countries shift focus away from counterterrorism concerns and toward geostrategic competition. Al Shabaab, al Qaeda’s East African affiliate, seized the opportunity to reestablish itself in south-central Somalia after US troops withdrew in January 2021 and again threatens Mogadishu’s security, despite the US military’s reentry to the country in May 2022. Al Qaeda–linked groups in the Sahel are capitalizing on a rash of coups, deteriorating security, and reduced counterterrorism pressure to embed themselves further in a growing swath of terrain. The Islamic State affiliate in Nigeria is expanding its operations into areas of greater concern to the Nigerian government. Salafi-jihadi groups across West Africa have tapped into illicit trafficking networks, deepening a symbiosis between terrorism and crime. Even in North Africa, where military and policing campaigns significantly degraded Salafi-jihadi groups in recent years, governance and security trends — particularly in Libya and Tunisia — signal opportunities for militants to regroup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding Salafi-jihadi militancy in Africa harms not only the militants’ direct victims but also those affected by related conflicts and humanitarian crises. Salafi-jihadi expansion also contributes to persistent instability that compounds state weakness. Antiliberal and antidemocratic actors can draw opportunity and justification from this weakness and the presence of jihadist terror threats. Long-running jihadist insurgencies and disruptive terror campaigns undermine economic growth in some of the continent’s poorest countries and disrupt global markets, including oil and gas. Instability, poor governance, and high security costs also threaten the advancement of cornerstone countries — those that will disproportionately affect the continent’s trajectory — including Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of Salafi-jihadi expansion in Africa reach beyond national and regional borders. African bases and affiliates help sustain the global Salafi-jihadi movement. Al Qaeda and the Islamic State’s African affiliates are more than just rebranded local insurgencies. Even newly pledged affiliates can derive concrete benefits from their participation in regional and global jihadi networks. As African Salafi-jihadi groups continue to develop more advanced military and nonmilitary capabilities, they stand to provide even greater benefits to the global movement in terms of recruits, money, propaganda, innovation, leadership, and safe havens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trigger point for Western policymakers to act is a transnational terror threat from one of these Salafi-jihadi groups. Yet though Africa-based groups are responsible for many attacks on limited Western interests in Africa, only a fraction of transnational terror attacks trace back to them. Islamic State attacks in Germany in 2016 and the UK in 2017 originated with external attack plotters in Libya. Al Shabaab has attempted to target international aviation in recent years, with a bomb attempt on a plane leaving Mogadishu in 2016 and an early-stage 9/11-style attack disrupted in the Philippines in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What national security strategies tend to overlook is that the maturation of African Salafi-jihadi groups will lead to an increased transnational terror threat. Local and global jihad are indelibly linked. Attack cells — the small groups of individuals involved in a terror attack — are small, but they rely on a threat node with a larger footprint. The threat node’s larger set of capabilities comes from Salafi-jihadi insurgent organizations’ regional support bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These regional bases also allow threat nodes to reconstitute, meaning that counterterrorism gains against particular plotters, attacks, and infrastructure are typically temporary, especially when there is a well-developed underpinning organization. Salafijihadi havens provide capabilities and resources, including “recruitment and inter-theater movement; funding; communication; counter-intelligence; media support; vetting, training, and indoctrination; weapons design expertise; and intelligence and planning.” Local and regional insurgencies provide destinations for foreign fighters and propaganda fodder for global Salafi-jihadi organizations. Entrenched jihadist insurgencies with governing capabilities are also preparing future recruits by indoctrinating a generation of children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US counterterrorism policies focus on eliminating threat nodes over removing regional support bases. These policies and accompanying legal authorities are structured around either actors’ present intent and active plotting or their past culpability for attacks. Identifying and destroying discrete terror networks is necessary to address present threats but fails to prevent new terror threats from emerging. The existence of a larger Salafi-jihadi base — the loose network of individuals, groups, and organizations united by a common cause — allows external attack plotting and facilitation networks to regenerate continually. The expansion of Salafi-jihadi insurgencies also creates new opportunities for terror networks to form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;African groups may become more direct participants in global jihad as they develop capabilities that they can use overseas. Every Salafi-jihadi group that has attacked transnationally began with a local focus; past examples show that groups can rapidly pivot to transnational attack plotting when circumstances shift. Not every Salafi-jihadi group will inevitably pursue or enable global terror campaigns. Some may calculate that eschewing such attacks better serves their efforts to achieve local dominance. Certainly, groups that originate within the Salafi-jihadi movement but disavow global terror deserve further study. But past patterns show that ideological, bureaucratic, and organizational factors, including intra-jihadist competition, push local groups toward pursuing transnational attacks directly or supporting externally focused attack networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tables in this report consider capabilities, resources, and opportunities that can be used to assess the relative strength of a Salafi-jihadi group in terms of its sophistication, effectiveness, and resilience. (See Figure 1.) These tables incorporate military and technical skills but recognize that assessments of militant groups’ strength often overvalue these “hard” metrics. The tables therefore also consider “softer” skills, including governance capabilities and organizational qualities, that affect groups’ ability to recover from hardships. This framework aims to facilitate comparing groups at different stages of development and track changes in groups’ capabilities, resources, and opportunities over time. Any effective policy for degrading the global Salafi-jihadi movement will require blocking or reducing groups’ overall capabilities and access to resources and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

AQIM activity in the Sahel is considered as part of JNIM. ** “JNIM and Allies” refers to groups that are part of JNIM and those that cooperate with it, including AQIM in the Sahel and Ansar al Islam in Burkina Faso. “ISCAP-DRC” refers to Islamic State Central Africa Province–Democratic Republic of Congo.

&lt;p&gt;These factors assess a group’s interaction with its audience, particularly the local population but also potential recruits regionally and globally. (See Table 1.) These criteria consider a group’s capacity to bend a population to its will by either force or persuasion and the local conditions that create opportunities for armed groups to influence communities. This analysis is a rough proxy for criteria that are difficult to judge, including popular sentiment and other hyperlocal dynamics, which should be studied for a deeper understanding of Salafi-jihadi groups’ effectiveness across local contexts. The factors are provision of social services, exercise of social control, effective use of propaganda, exploitation of local networks, and mobilization of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors analyze an armed group’s ability to build, acquire, and use tools for making war. (See Table 2). They consider conventional and unconventional military effectiveness and terror attack capability, ranging from local to transnational. The factors are bomb making, access to weapons systems, sophisticated tactics, local force projection, regional force projection, global terror attack capability, presence of elite units, access to resources, and access to a permissive environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors consider a group’s ability to coordinate people toward its goals by managing its internal processes and its interactions with other organizations. (See Table 3.) These criteria also consider groups’ contributions to the broader Salafi-jihadi movement. The factors are the ability to generate force, resilience and adaptability, the ability to integrate with and amplify Salafi-jihadi networks, and interaction with competitors and the presence of infighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The below narratives consider the trajectories of several African Salafi-jihadi groups that have gained and lost capabilities. The narratives explore different categories of capability: governance, military and technical, and organizational. They consider how these capabilities affect each other and contribute to the groups’ overall resilience and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al Qaeda Plays Politics in the Sahel.&lt;/strong&gt; The Salafi-jihadi expansion in the Sahel demonstrates the importance of adaptation to a local social context. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) emerged from Algeria’s 1991–2002 civil war, and its leaders have largely been Algerians focused on North African affairs. Yet this group leveraged its foothold in southern Algeria to set off a chain of jihadist activity in the Sahel that, a decade later, has spread all the way to the Gulf of Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AQIM came to the Sahel because of the opportunities that region presented. The group took up lucrative kidnapping-for-ransom efforts in southern Algeria and over time embedded itself in cross-border human networks, including through intermarriage. This attenuation to local dynamics and Malian security forces’ inability to apply consistent pressure allowed AQIM to establish a consistent presence in northern Mali, though not to overtly control terrain. (See Figure 2.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AQIM rapidly increased its influence in northern Mali by tapping into elite Tuareg networks. AQIM and its partner, the Tuareg-majority militant group Ansar al Din, outcompeted a less-organized non-jihadi group to take lead of the rebellion that controlled northern Mali. (See Figure 3.) Organization and governance provision helped AQIM and Ansar al Din overtake their rivals before implementing a hard-line interpretation of shari’a. (See Figure 4.)&lt;/p&gt;

Halloran and Zimmerman’s analysis uses data from RFI, BBC, Reuters, and Al Jazeera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AQIM and its allies have continued to embed themselves in the Sahel’s social fabric by taking advantage of weak competitors and adapting to local conditions. Salafi-jihadi militants, despite their violence, have cultivated a reputation for being less corrupt than local or national authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AQIM’s longevity also stems from organizational and ideological flexibility across a diverse jihadist network. The Salafi-jihadi ecosystem in the Sahel is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation, but these internal squabbles have largely not undermined the movement and its goals. Several factions split off in the early 2010s due to frustrations with leadership, including limited opportunities for non-Arab militants. But the Salafi-jihadi network in the Sahel seems to have largely overcome this challenge through a franchising model in which ideological ties integrate armed groups aligned to multiple ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jama’at Nusrat al Islam wa al Muslimeen’s (JNIM) 2017 formation underscores this dynamic. JNIM formed through a merger that brought together several AQIM-linked groups, including the Tuareg-majority Ansar al Din and the Fulani-majority Macina Liberation Front (MLF). JNIM’s federation model enables its subgroups to operate where they are most effective. The MLF has led JNIM’s expansion through central Mali and into Burkina Faso. (See Figures 5 and 6.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MLF has introduced a more grassroots model of engaging with local populations, in contrast to AQIM’s initial entry through Tuareg elites. The MLF practices a combination of coercion and negotiation to develop de facto control relationships with villages. The Fulani population in central Mali includes many pastoralists often marginalized by state structures and in conflict with other communities. The MLF has merged Fulani grievances with a narrative of religious legitimacy to cast itself as the population’s defender. (See Figure 7.) The MLF’s success in its pressure-and-governance campaign has also yielded military benefits, bringing it within striking distance of Mali’s capital and facilitating attacks on strategic Malian military positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JNIM has weathered a challenge from an Islamic State affiliate in the Sahel. Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), which originated as an AQIM splinter group, has challenged JNIM in some areas, including in attracting defectors. ISGS is likely not a serious threat to JNIM’s overall dominance in large areas of Mali and Burkina Faso, however. (See Figure 8). JNIM and ISGS have vacillated between cooperation, conflict, and deconfliction, and they will likely carve out separate spheres of influence over the long term. ISGS’s presence allows JNIM to present itself as comparatively moderate. JNIM fighters, likely from the MLF, may now be partnering with non-jihadist forces against ISGS. JNIM will likely suffer some short-term losses but will cement its ties to local communities — and its base for fighting against the Malian government — in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

Salafi-Jihadi Areas of Operation in the Sahel.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/salafi-jihadi-areas-of-operation-in-the-sahel&quot;&gt;Brian Carter, “Salafi-Jihadi Areas of Operation in the Sahel,” Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, September 30, 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JNIM’s governance proposal is perhaps best described as solving the problem it helped create. The group strikes security agreements with communities in Mali and Burkina Faso, granting truces or providing security while requiring residents to accept the group’s interpretation and implementation of shari’a. The deals, accepted by community leaders desperate to stop displacement and violence, reflect exhaustion with years of violence perpetrated by jihadists, state security forces, local militias, and foreign forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of JNIM’s progress is owed to its adversaries’ shortcomings, including a Malian state that has an absent, if not abusive, relationship with many communities in northern and central Mali. Mali’s recent coups and its government’s hiring of Russian Wagner Group mercenaries have only intensified negative relationships between security forces and populations in central Mali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JNIM’s application of governance skills and military strategy will allow it to solidify its position as the de facto governing entity across large areas of Mali and Burkina Faso. JNIM — and al Qaeda — will consider this success against the “near enemy” a major victory for the movement. JNIM media has drawn parallels between the 2021 French withdrawal from Mali and the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan, placing JNIM within an al Qaeda strategic narrative that prioritizes long-term insurgencies to remove external forces and topple local “apostate” governments. In an August 2021 video, the group’s leader called for Muslims to rise up and attack France, Israel, Russia, and the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These threats do not indicate that JNIM will immediately plot or facilitate external attacks, but they demonstrate the group’s ideological predisposition to support such operations. JNIM has not followed the model of the former al Qaeda–linked group Hayat Tahrir al Sham in Syria, which disavowed external terror attack plotting. JNIM’s expansion in the Sahel not only delivers another victory to al Qaeda’s model for jihadist takeovers but also perpetuates the Salafi-jihadi transnational terror threat by providing havens and a growing pool of funding and recruits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Islamic State in Libya Loses the Governance Game.&lt;/strong&gt; The Islamic State’s branch in Libya rose rapidly thanks to external support and the chaotic conditions of Libya’s civil war. But the group also collapsed quickly, in part because it failed to root itself into the local community and align itself with popular grievances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-Libya rose rapidly in 2014 and 2015, capitalizing on the Libyan Salafi-jihadi networks that had reemerged as the Libyan state disintegrated. The Islamic State provided crucial expertise and startup funding, including senior leaders with wartime experience in Iraq and Syria. The Islamic State highlighted IS-Libya as its priority outpost beyond its core terrain, particularly as the group consolidated control of Sirte — Muammar Qaddafi’s hometown and a city largely abandoned between the front lines of Libya’s civil war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-Libya developed an advanced military capability, including the capacity to build and use multiple suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices. Islamic State media highlighted its governance project in the city. IS-Libya attracted significant numbers of foreign fighters, including many from neighboring Tunisia and an unprecedented mobilization of militants from sub-Saharan Africa. IS-Libya also supported external attack planners. The group facilitated the Berlin Christmas market attack in 2016 and the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017. (See Figure 9.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, IS-Libya’s high public profile and appearance of strength belied weaknesses in its organization and ability to exert control and influence. The group’s multiple outposts in Libya gradually crumbled when rival armed groups — including some linked to al Qaeda — mobilized against it. IS-Libya’s crown jewel, Sirte, slipped from its fingers, first because it struggled to provide for civilians and eventually its fighters there and second because the group expanded too far westward, inciting the military campaign that would oust it from the city. IS-Libya’s lack of ties to the local population left its remnants vulnerable in desert camps far from populated areas, making it vulnerable to follow-on strikes that decimated its forces. (See Figure 10.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-Libya today is a rump group in a remote area, still lacking governance capabilities and organizational backing. It retains explosive attack capabilities but is not waging a consistent insurgency, instead launching intermittent attacks on security forces. (See Figure 11.) Its trajectory demonstrates the limits of pursuing a territorial insurgency that draws too much support from external organizations and a global narrative. IS-Libya is not defunct, however, and continues to play an amplifying role by providing trainers to militants in West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al Shabaab in Somalia Builds Skills over Years.&lt;/strong&gt; Al Shabaab’s greatest asset may be time. The group has persisted thanks to a combination of its own strategy and innovation and its adversaries’ failure to sustain an effective effort against it. This persistence has allowed the group to entwine itself into Somalia’s political economy. Al Shabaab has also increased its military and technical skills and its organizational sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Shabaab developed out of Somalia’s civil war and has benefited and survived thanks to its ability to exploit a fragmented Somali society. The militant wing of the Islamic Courts Union that took over Somalia in the early 2000s, al Shabaab capitalized on the 2006 Ethiopian intervention to garner popular support. (See Figure 12.) This support waned when the intervention ended, but al Shabaab weathered the transition, largely because Somalia’s fractious political environment did not yield an effective alternative or sufficient armed force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9kRE97k.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Shabaab adapted to military setbacks. It successfully transitioned to a rural insurgency after losing control of major cities in 2011 and 2012. (See Figure 13.) This setback may have ironically preserved the al Shabaab insurgency by relieving from it the potentially delegitimizing challenge of needing to govern densely populated areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sXVvzBP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Shabaab has also weathered particularly fractious internal dynamics. Internecine squabbles and even significant defections have not destroyed the group, but rather they have concentrated control with its most hard-line leaders. The group has thus far demonstrated the capability to crush dissent and suppress rivals, notably the Islamic State. The current Somali government’s efforts to include al Shabaab defectors in government may challenge al Shabaab in certain regions, but there is not yet evidence of growing internal divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Shabaab has deeply enmeshed itself in the Somali economy, particularly in south and south-central Somalia. The group makes as much revenue as the Somali federal government — enough to surpass AQIM as al Qaeda’s richest affiliate. Al Shabaab’s many moneymaking endeavors include the black-market charcoal trade, widespread extortion of Somali businesses, and taxation of the populations it controls. Al Shabaab also manipulates humanitarian aid in famine-hit Somalia, sometimes blocking distribution but other times stealing and redistributing supplies. (See Figure 14).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/j6oy49T.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Shabaab’s access to relatively secure havens and its now decade-long fighting experience have created ample opportunity for it to increase its military and technical capability over time. (See Figure 15.) It has gained expertise from the al Qaeda network, particularly al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in nearby Yemen. Iraq may have been the source for al Shabaab’s development of armor-piercing improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VJue0In.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula’s expertise likely supported al Shabaab’s 2016 use of a laptop bomb in a botched attempt to destroy a passenger airplane leaving Mogadishu. Al Shabaab has also adapted to gain access to explosive power to support its military campaigns. It has increasingly relied on manufacturing its own homemade explosives from industrial precursors, instead of scavenging explosives, since 2017. Further, al Shabaab has demonstrated the capability to integrate IED attacks into complex military operations. The group, like other Salafi-jihadi groups on the continent and elsewhere, has begun to adopt drones for surveillance purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Shabaab maintains specialized units to conduct regional terror attacks and pursue transnational operations. Elite al Shabaab units focus on internal security and external operations, including infamous attacks in Kenya such as the 2013 Westgate Mall attack, the 2015 Garissa University attack, and the 2019 DusitD2 hotel attack. The planner of the Camp Simba attack in 2020, al Shabaab’s first on a US military installation in Kenya, also coordinated an external attack network. (See Figure 16.) The group has shown more ambition in recent years, including dispatching members to pilot training in the early stages of planning a 9/11-style attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cB0Ml0a.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Shabaab and IS-Somalia both support Salafi-jihadi networks across East Africa. Fighters who became part of the current Islamic State–linked insurgency in Mozambique trained in Somalia, for example. IS-Somalia, though contained in Somalia by al Shabaab, serves as a coordination unit for Islamic State affiliates in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Mozambique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Islamic State in Nigeria Learns from Its Network.&lt;/strong&gt; Salafi-jihadi militants in Nigeria have transformed from a brutal but localized threat into a potential regional and global threat as they have become increasingly enmeshed in the Islamic State’s network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group known as Boko Haram started on the margins of the global Salafi-jihadi movement. Al Qaeda expressed interest in a relationship, but personal and ideological conflicts prevented Boko Haram from officially joining. Boko Haram’s leader from 2009 to 2021, Abubakr Shekau, broke with al Qaeda’s teaching on several key issues, most importantly by defining any Muslim who did not support Boko Haram as a lawful target. (See Figure 17.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/A2BmWZF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 17. Boko Haram Activity in Nigeria, 2013.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Boko-Haram&quot;&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica, s.v. “Boko Haram,” accessed November 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shekau’s ideological divergences with al Qaeda and his brutality helped set up a relationship with the Islamic State. Islamic State leaders, focused on building their global network, supported Boko Haram’s mass kidnapping of schoolgirls in 2014 and the group’s focus on holding territory and immediately implementing shari’a. The Islamic State’s objectives aligned with Shekau’s search for legitimacy and possibly other Boko Haram leaders’ desire to moderate him. Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in March 2015, becoming the Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining the Islamic State accelerated organizational changes in ISWAP and gave the group funding and training from the Islamic State network. Recognizing Shekau’s ungovernability, Islamic State central backed an effort to oust him. ISWAP then rebranded to bolster its popular support, including announcing a focus on military — not civilian — targets. The Islamic State also provided money and capabilities directly, including giving more than a million dollars in 2017 and linking ISWAP to a network of trainers and IS officials operating predominantly in Libya through northern and western Africa. Islamic State leaders directly engage in ISWAP leadership affairs, including at least one potential instance of backing the murder of an ISWAP official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISWAP has continued to draw legitimacy and some concrete benefits from its Islamic State membership, even as the Islamic State has weakened in its core terrain and likely lost the ability to give significant cash transfusions to its African branches. ISWAP received training on small-arms tactics that improved its military effectiveness. The group has also begun using drones for surveillance thanks to training from the Islamic State network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Islamic State in turn uses ISWAP — which is still the largest, deadliest, and most active among its African affiliates — to bolster its self-reported statistics when many other affiliates and the core group are relatively less active. (See Figure 18.) Islamic State media frequently highlights ISWAP in its major publications. An Islamic State periodical even called for hijra (migration) to Africa, reflecting its greater focus on this theater as a key part of the group’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islamic State in Tunisia: Tied to Regional Circumstances. The rise and decline of the Islamic State in Tunisia demonstrates the potential fragility of Salafi-jihadi insurgencies that rely heavily on external support and cross-border havens. This case is also a warning, because Tunisia continues to suffer from many of the dynamics that yielded significant Islamic State recruitment, indicating that latent terror networks likely remain a potent threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arab Spring period created an opportunity for jihadi experimentation and innovation in Tunisia. Ansar al Shari’a in Tunisia, an al Qaeda associate, capitalized on the mobilization of society during and after the revolution to convert itself from a covert network to a social movement. The Syrian civil war also proved a potent mobilizer, with nearly 30,000 Tunisians attempting to travel to Syria and several thousand succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Islamic State’s infrastructure in Syria, and particularly in Libya, proved effective for exporting violence back to Tunisia. The Islamic State was particularly effective at targeting Tunisian tourism, with major attacks in 2014 and 2015 that cratered the Tunisian tourism industry. (See Figure 19.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/azpu3NW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image22&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Islamic State’s assault on Tunisia peaked in 2016 with an incident that underscored the group’s ambitions and shortcomings. A large contingent of militants based in northwestern Libya attempted a cross-border assault to seize the Tunisian town of Ben Guerdane. (See Figure 20.) The assault failed, however, reflecting several changes that made Tunisia a less permissible environment for a major Islamic State campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iyiJ4Ri.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 20. Major Islamic State Attacks in Tunisia, 2015–16.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author. Created with Datawrapper.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Tunisian military and security forces had become more effective, thanks to government and foreign partner initiatives since 2015. The local population resisted the Islamic State assault — to the group’s surprise — and received backup from security forces. The Ben Guerdane attack also catalyzed another surge of Western foreign military aid. Tunisia has also significantly hardened its border with Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Islamic State had begun to lose its secure haven in Libya. A month before the Ben Guerdane attack, a US air strike killed a major Tunisian Islamic State leader in northwestern Libya, near the Tunisian border. Local power brokers soon decided to oust the Islamic State presence from the area, denying the group the base it had used to coordinate prior attacks in Tunisia. The Islamic State’s position in Libya continued to split throughout 2016, culminating in the group’s loss of its primary foothold in Sirte. While the Islamic State still has a presence in remote southwestern Libya, it lacks access to populated areas and accessible cross-border routes into Tunisia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Islamic State is no longer visible as an organized group in Tunisia. It likely has remnants in remote areas in the country’s interior, where insurgents are often based, and there are indications of terror and radicalization networks in the more populated coastal areas. The group has not conducted a major attack in years, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet Tunisia still faces a serious latent threat. The underlying grievances that fed the Islamic State’s recruitment drive in the country have not resolved and may even worsen, given current economic woes and political crackdowns. Tunisia also faces the challenge of foreign fighters returning from Libya and Syria and a large, radicalized prison population. IS-Tunisia thus likely has the human resources it needs to reactivate, particularly if the Tunisian state destabilizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;takeaways-the-local-context-for-jihad&quot;&gt;Takeaways: The Local Context for Jihad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis describes a set of circumstances from which Salafi-jihadi groups draw potential energy that they can use to react to setbacks or exploit opportunities. US policy largely treats these groups as threats to partner countries only because their demonstrated capabilities do not yet threaten the US homeland. But this view misunderstands the interdependence between the local and global contexts for jihad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The persistence and spread of regional Salafi-jihadi insurgencies sustains global networks and repeatedly erodes or even reverses the effects of counterterrorism interventions, which focus on removing groups’ military capabilities. Counterterrorism operations aimed at eliminating threat nodes are similarly reactive and will not prevent “locally focused” Salafi-jihadi groups from turning their capabilities and resources toward transnational goals as opportunities arise. The groups that pose the most serious long-term threat are adaptable organizations that embed in local contexts and can capitalize on changing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptability.&lt;/strong&gt; The groups that have strengthened over time are adaptive, learning organizations that can shift in response to setbacks and opportunities. One version of adaptability that successful groups practice is shifting between a “territorial” and “semi-territorial” presence. Al Shabaab in Somalia and AQIM in Mali both survived military losses in the early 2010s by shifting from overt territorial control to rural insurgency, a transformation that allowed them to entrench themselves into economic networks and prepare to capitalize on moments of state weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salafi-jihadi groups have demonstrated a wide range of adaptations, including deploying strategic ambiguity and plausible deniability to avoid attracting a Western counterterrorism response. Highly adaptable groups are more likely to survive and gain the capabilities and resources to become a regional or even global threat — particularly if they demonstrate an ability to balance localized political dynamics while maintaining a relationship with transnational jihadist networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embeddedness.&lt;/strong&gt; Local dynamics — and militants’ attenuation to them — primarily determine a group’s trajectory. Groups that receive heavy support from a global jihadist outfit, such as IS-Libya or IS-Tunisia, may struggle to recover from setbacks if they lack a robust local support base. Groups that are more rooted in local armed conflicts can benefit from targeted infusions of expertise and money to increase their effectiveness in military operations and strategic communications, as demonstrated by the Islamic State’s support for its West and Central Africa Provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most dangerous group is therefore one that is primarily oriented on its local governance objective and has demonstrated skill at exploiting the local context but can simultaneously absorb high-end capabilities from the global network. Among current African groups, al Shabaab most emulates this model, given its enduring haven and access to expertise from within the al Qaeda network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunism.&lt;/strong&gt; Salafi-jihadi insurgencies form when governance and security gaps are already present. They benefit from and sometimes accelerate these conditions but do not initiate them. Likewise, the greatest opportunities for jihadists to succeed come from collapsing governance and security conditions, not groups’ own huge leaps in capability or ambition. For example, ISWAP has expanded its area of operations outside its core areas in northeastern Nigeria by taking advantage of the destabilization of the northwest and proliferation of non-state armed actors there. This adaptation indicates that ISWAP is building its capability to threaten the Nigerian capital while counterbalancing military pressure in its main havens, in northeastern Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communal violence, civil wars, violent uprisings, and any other major destabilizing incident creates an opportunity for jihadist expansion wherever insurgencies are already established or jihadist networks are latent. Heavy-handed security responses intended to quell or crush unrest also feed the grievances that fuel Salafi-jihadi insurgencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-implications-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Implications and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis points to a necessary rethink in US policy to counter the Salafi-jihadi movement. The United States’ counterterrorism policy and the counterterrorism policies of its allies and partners are missing the opening to stop Salafi-jihadi insurgencies from forming and becoming entrenched. At worst, bad counterterrorism policies — particularly when militaries and vigilantes conduct human rights abuses — hasten jihadist entrenchment by allowing groups to install themselves as security providers and defenders of vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterterrorism properly understood refers to both largely kinetic efforts to destroy the parts of groups that plan and execute external terror attacks and homeland security defenses to disrupt active terror plots. Counterterrorism is a necessary part of the national security tool kit for countering extant or emerging threat nodes, but it is not a substitute for removing the group’s base of support. Military campaigns may be disproportionately effective in cases in which the Salafi-jihadi support base is limited, as in the case of IS-Libya and IS-Tunisia’s Libya-based contingent. But when Salafi-jihadi insurgencies are more embedded, military-forward counterterrorism efforts at best temporarily suppress militant activity and at worst cause popular backlash on which militants can capitalize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heavily kinetic counterterrorism tool kit cannot defeat Salafi-jihadi insurgencies because it does not fill the governance gaps that allowed for jihadist entrenchment in the first place. And counterterrorism is inherently reactive — responding to a threat after that threat has already formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US should instead focus on policies to prevent Salafi-jihadi groups from taking root. Orienting an interagency focus on this goal requires transforming foreign assistance to emphasize “conflict prevention, stabilization, and peace building.” A key challenge is mobilizing conflict prevention and governance-building resources into the areas most at risk, which are often peripherals prone to conflict and lacking positive or effective ties to the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has prioritized providing military training and support for anti-Salafi-jihadi forces. More attention must be placed on improving these actors’ ability to outcompete Salafi-jihadi groups through governance — for example, through providing impartial dispute-resolution mechanisms and overseeing implementation of basic social services and aid distribution. Surging governance and aid to areas affected by violence is especially important to preempt Salafi-jihadi groups from taking root or re-forming after losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US agencies should make institutional changes, including accepting a higher degree of calculated risk to diplomatic and military personnel pursuing their missions. Proactive policy also requires streamlining and coordinating US assistance across multiple agencies to avoid fatal delays in which much money is spent but no action taken until a jihadist insurgency has already destabilized the at-risk region in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers have an opportunity in motion to pursue these changes, if senior officials are willing to back real change. The 2019 Global Fragility Act (GFA) initiates a framework for an integrated and prevention-focused approach to countering state fragility, with the goal of closing off opportunities to not only Salafi-jihadi groups but also other malign actors, including criminal actors and state adversaries and their proxies. The US government has already selected countries for GFA plans, including Libya, Mozambique, and five coastal West African countries. The primary risk is that these plans will relabel existing initiatives and fail to implement the integration that the GFA seeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also challenges in implementation. The GFA aims to create new flexible and long-term funding mechanisms, but its implementers warn of impediments to their ability to move money quickly to launch programs before conditions deteriorate beyond prevention. The GFA presents an opportunity to implement US lessons learned from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars; senior officials should not let this opportunity pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A policy focused on closing space to adversaries, including the Salafi-jihadi movement, requires a serious focus on increasing US diplomatic capability beyond what the GFA alone can deliver. Countering fragility targets areas not yet or not currently afflicted by an entrenched Salafi-jihadi insurgency, and it is worthwhile, particularly because many countries in Africa are in this at-risk stage. But counter-fragility approaches come too late for the countries that are already fighting long-running wars with al Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates, such as Somalia and Mali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US policy so far has focused on supporting and training partner militaries, with mixed results because of the weaknesses of the Somali and Malian states. In Somalia, the renewed US deployment has bolstered a Somali offensive against al Shabaab that is the most promising push against the group in years. There has not been a complementary increase in US diplomatic energy, however, which is necessary to support the Somali government through the long-term challenge of outcompeting al Shabaab governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US needs to reframe its involvement in these counterterrorism fights to prioritize conflict resolution and diplomacy, with military engagement subordinated to this larger goal. Likewise, the US should accept risk on short-term military victories — with mitigations in place — for the sake of bringing necessary pressure to bear on regimes that need to reform their approach. Only resolving the conflicts and their underlying grievances will create conditions for the long-term defeat of entrenched Salafi-jihadi insurgencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers also need to recognize the significant overlap of counterterrorism, counter-fragility efforts, and the geostrategic competition problem sets. Fragile environments create opportunities for state and non-state actors alike. The presence of Salafi-jihadis in particular creates cover for malign actors pursuing other goals. For example, the Wagner Group’s deployments in Africa can be seen as a sanctions evasion scheme and regime preservation-for-hire often cloaked in the language of counterterrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is seeking stronger partnerships in Africa to counter the expansion of Russian and particularly Chinese influence there. US presence and relationships are crucial to having the partnerships and positions necessary to compete over time, and engaging on countering the Salafi-jihadi movement is both an independent goal and a way to sustain and enhance the US position on the continent. European security also cannot be divorced from African security; humanitarian crises and conflicts in Africa, as well as jihadist and criminal activity, affect European security and political cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US government faces an obvious prioritization challenge because it lacks the resources and bandwidth to counter fragility everywhere. Policymakers should therefore improve US analytical capabilities to facilitate prioritization and early recognition. New Salafi-jihadi groups do not form and existing groups do not embark on dangerous trajectories without notice, and their development does not pose a particularly difficult analytical puzzle. Rather, the US intelligence community faces a challenge of collection, processing, and synthesis. Analysts working on Africa and other non-priority areas are spread thin and often responsible for covering many countries and regions simultaneously, a trend that the prioritization of East Asia and the Russian invasion of Ukraine will only exacerbate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classified collection assets, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), are limited, and the huge amount of available open-source information goes underutilized due to bandwidth constraints, linguistic limitations, and institutional cultures favoring classified sourcing. Senior leaders should dedicate resources and shift incentives to encourage the intelligence community to maintain an ongoing picture of potential threats in fragile environments. A broader, deeper, and more sustained approach to collection and analysis will help the US government identify threshold-crossing jihadist insurgencies and gain awareness of — and the ability to counter — the actions of geopolitical competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transforming US policy to deny resources and opportunities to the Salafi-jihadi movement will take time, and Salafi-jihadi groups are already reaching new thresholds of capability in many cases. US officials should therefore identify and pursue mitigations while the larger policy transformation occurs. These mitigations should include investing in the collection and analysis of intelligence on the Salafi-jihadi movement. This is primarily a resource question, particularly as high-demand intelligence assets are shifted to other regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress should prioritize increasing the US military and intelligence communities’ acquisition of ISR assets to meet this demand. Increased investments in human intelligence and open-source and language capabilities are necessary to avoid strategic surprise. Increased focus on diplomatic engagement in at-risk countries will also improve the intelligence picture. Sustaining this intelligence picture should also feed robust crisis-response planning for future state collapses, including expected periods of increased instability during governmental transition. This planning should include working with partner countries to secure critical infrastructure and materials in the event of instability and a Salafi-jihadi surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes are too high for US policymakers to ignore African security, no matter how much they may want to. The Salafi-jihadi movement is a virulent movement that is not declining and will likely enter a new phase marked by increased global terror attacks. It will overlap in fragile areas and strategic terrain with geostrategic competition, particularly in East Africa and increasingly along the West African Atlantic coast. The growth of illiberal movements, including the Salafi-jihadi movement and autocratic and illiberal regimes, threatens the US-led world order that undergirds US power and prosperity. The US must be forward-thinking, not reactive, in Africa and recognize that failing to partner with Africans in a more secure and prosperous future will harm US security in the coming decades. A status quo, wait-and-see approach will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;appendix-a-salafi-jihadi-group-reference-guide&quot;&gt;Appendix A. Salafi-Jihadi Group Reference Guide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This appendix defines the groups named in the report, in the order in which they appear in the tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State Algeria Province (IS-Algeria).&lt;/strong&gt; The Islamic State recognized this wilayah (province) in Algeria in 2014. Security pressure has rendered this group largely defunct since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).&lt;/strong&gt; AQIM originated in 1998 during the Algerian civil war. It took on its current name when it affiliated with al Qaeda in 2006. The tables in this report use “AQIM” to refer to the North African components of the group, including AQIM activity in Algeria and AQIM-linked groups in Libya and Tunisia, including the Uqba ibn Nafa’a Brigade. AQIM and its affiliates are also active in the Sahel. The tables use “JNIM and allies” to denote AQIM and AQIM-linked organizations in the Sahel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State in Tunisia (IS-Tunisia).&lt;/strong&gt; IS-Tunisia refers to the network of Islamic State members and sympathizers in Tunisia. The Islamic State never declared an official wilayah in Tunisia but produces media about Islamic State–linked activity in Tunisia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State Libya Province (IS-Libya).&lt;/strong&gt; IS-Libya refers to the Islamic State’s Libya Province. The Islamic State declared three Libya provinces — Tarablus (Tripoli), Barqah (Cyrenaica), and Fezzan — in 2014. The Islamic State shifted to referring to thegroup as its Libya Province in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State Sinai Province (IS-Sinai).&lt;/strong&gt; IS-Sinai is a former al Qaeda affiliate active in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula since 2011. It pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harakat al Shabaab al Mujahideen (al Shabaab).&lt;/strong&gt; Al Shabaab is al Qaeda’s primary affiliate in East Africa. It is based in Somalia but also active in Kenya and has attacked in Ethiopia and Uganda. The group formed as an armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union in the mid-2000s. Al Qaeda recognized al Shabaab as an affiliate in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State Somalia Province (IS-Somalia).&lt;/strong&gt; IS-Somalia is an al Shabaab splinter group that pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015. Islamic State leadership accepted this pledge in 2017. IS-Somalia operates primarily in Puntland in northern Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State Central Africa Province–Democratic Republic of Congo (ISCAP-DRC).&lt;/strong&gt; The Islamic State announced its Central Africa Province in 2019, incorporating Salafi-jihadi insurgent groups active in the DRC and Mozambique. These groups operated independently, despite their shared name. The DRC branch of ISCAP developed from the Allied Democratic Forces, an insurgent group that originated in Uganda in the early 1990s and has been based in the DRC since 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State Mozambique Province (IS-Mozambique).&lt;/strong&gt; IS-Mozambique is active in northern Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado Province. It officially joined the Islamic State as part of the Central Africa Province in 2019. The Islamic State began referring to IS-Mozambique separately from ISCAP-DRC in May 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jama’at Nusrat al Islam wa al Muslimeen (JNIM) and Allies.&lt;/strong&gt; JNIM is AQIM’s affiliate in the Sahel and the successor of AQIM’s networks that became prominent in Mali in 2012. It formed in 2017 from a merger of several AQIM-linked groups: AQIM’s Sahara Emirate, Ansar al Din, al Murabitoun, and the Macina Liberation Front (MLF). “Allies” refers to smaller brigades active within JNIM’s orbit and Ansar al Islam, a Burkina Faso–based group that cooperates with JNIM. JNIM is active in Mali and Burkina Faso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State Sahel Province, or Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS).&lt;/strong&gt; ISGS is a commonly used name for the Islamic State’s affiliate in the Sahel. The group’s founder, the prior leader of a splinter group that had broken from AQIM, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015. The Islamic State formally accepted this pledge in 2019, recognizing the group under the umbrella of its Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), though the Sahel branch continued to function independently. The Islamic State recognized ISGS as an independent unit, the Islamic State Sahel Province, in 2022. ISGS operates in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Jama’at Ahl al Sunna lil Da’wa wal Jihad (Boko Haram).&lt;/strong&gt; Boko Haram formed as a religious movement in northeastern Nigeria and transitioned to an armed uprising in 2009. The group pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015, changing its name to ISWAP. A subsequent schism divided the group. ISWAP largely overtook the rump Boko Haram in 2021. ISWAP and the Boko Haram remnants operate in northern Nigeria, particularly the northeast, and border regions of Cameroon, Chad, and Niger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jama’at Ansar al Muslimeen fi Bilad al Sudan (Ansaru).&lt;/strong&gt; Ansaru is an al Qaeda–aligned group that splintered from Boko Haram in 2012. Ansaru resumed attacks in northwestern Nigeria in 2020 after a multi-year dormancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;appendix-b-matrix-definitions&quot;&gt;Appendix B. Matrix Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This appendix defines criteria for assessing Salafi-jihadi groups’ capabilities and access to opportunities and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;governance-factors&quot;&gt;Governance Factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors assess a group’s interaction with its audience, particularly the local population but also potential recruits regionally and globally. These criteria consider a group’s capacity to bend a population to its will by either force or persuasion and the local conditions that create opportunities for armed groups to influence communities. This analysis is a rough proxy for criteria that are difficult to judge, including popular sentiment and other hyperlocal dynamics, which should be studied for a deeper understanding of Salafi-jihadi groups’ effectiveness across local contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide Social Services.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor assesses a group’s ability to deliver services to a target population. Groups are categorized according to the highest level of service they provide, even if they also provide fewer or no services in other parts of their area of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group functions as the de facto state through direct rule. It provides services such as health care, education, dispute resolution, and security. It conducts large-scale, organized taxation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group functions as a de facto state in combination with local authorities. It provides services and enforces some rules.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group provides intermittent services, such as dispute resolution, justice, and some rule setting. It may have set up internal governance structures serving its members.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group provides no services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Social Control.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor assesses a group’s ability to control the behavior of a target population. Groups are categorized according to the highest level of control they exert, even if they exert a lesser level of control or influence in other parts of their area of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group is capable of declaring and enforcing modes of living unilaterally in some areas, including public executions and other mandatory events. It rapidly quells dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group has a looser control structure and may exert influence through preexisting local organizations and leadership networks. It can change some modes of living through a combination of force and negotiation. The group may tolerate or negotiate some dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group engages in intermittent engagements to shape a population’s behavior, including preaching and violence such as kidnapping or assassination. It may extract taxes. Rival governing structures and security forces contest the group’s ability to exercise social control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group is not in regular contact with communities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective Propaganda.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor assesses a group’s ability to spread its message and cause effects through distributing media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group or its partners distribute high-quality media that reaches global and local audiences. This media may have inspired attacks in locations outside its area of operations or attracted foreign fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group or its partners distribute high-quality media for a local audience, including videos. The group features in jihadist propaganda outside its local area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group or its partners distribute low-quality media for a local audience. Global jihadist outlets cover its activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group distributes no media. Global jihadist outlets may mention it irregularly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploitation of Local Networks.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor assesses a group’s ability to suppress or exploit local political and security networks toward its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group can suppress and deter rivals. There is no significant rival for providing security or governance inside its control or support zones. The group is integrated into human networks and the local economy. It does not need to collaborate with non–ideologically aligned groups at a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group is taking steps to integrate with the local community, including intermarriage and alliance formation. It may work to undermine rivals by stoking or participating in communal conflict or aligning itself with particular populations. It may cooperate with other armed groups, including non–ideologically aligned groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: As a territorial insurgency, the group can deny access to terrain and prey on local populations but does not integrate with local networks and operates in remote areas. Alternately, as a clandestine network,103 the group can maintain covert terror cells and safe houses in populated areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group has largely hostile encounters with the local population and can only exist in a remote area without state power. The population may perceive it as foreign.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobilization of Population.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers the level of grievance that elements of the population hold against either state authorities or other segments of the population. This analysis assumes that a degree of population mobilization and poor governance is a requirement for the survival of a Salafi-jihadi insurgency, particularly one that seeks to hold terrain. This factor approximates popular mobilization by combining three criteria defined in The Underestimated Insurgency: African States at Risk for Salafi-Jihadi Insurgencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use of Conflict.&lt;/em&gt; This criterion refers to the prevalence of conflict as a means to resolve political disputes. It considers the national level, including civil war, armed takeovers of government, and the projected risk of mass killing in which the state is the perpetrator or is unable or unwilling to prevent mass conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: Civil war or internal military conflict is ongoing or occurred in the past six months, a military coup occurred in the past six months, or mass killing is assessed as ongoing or at increasing risk of happening.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: Civil war or internal military conflict or coup occurred in the past year or period of expected civil war averted in the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: Civil war or internal military conflict or coup occurred in the past two years or period of expected civil war averted in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: Not applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abusive Security Forces.&lt;/em&gt; This criterion approximates harmful security force behavior toward civilians by comparing current reporting on human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: Security forces regularly abuse civilians and prisoners (e.g., summary executions and collective punishment) with overt or tacit government support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: There are intermittent security force abuses (e.g., violently dispersing protesters).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: There is abusive use of detention but less tendency to use violence against civilians. Security forces fail to respond to protect civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: Security forces generally work professionally and in the population’s interest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intergroup Grievances.&lt;/em&gt; This criterion approximates the level of hostility between population groups using the “group grievance” indicator from the Fragile States Index 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: 7.5–10.0.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: 5.0–7.4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: 2.5–4.9.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: 0–2.4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-and-technical-factors&quot;&gt;Military and Technical Factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors analyze an armed group’s ability to build, acquire, and use tools for making war. They consider both conventional and unconventional military effectiveness and terror attack capability ranging from local to transnational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bomb Making.&lt;/strong&gt; Improvised explosive device (IED) development is one indicator of a group’s growing lethality. This factor is important for assessing not only the development of a group’s terror attack capabilities but also its asymmetric military capabilities. Salafi-jihadi militants regularly use explosives to increase the effectiveness of their ground assaults in lieu of conventional weaponry. Drivable suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (SVBIEDs) require technical skill and relatively long logistical chains to make, and groups use them to augment conventional attacks and conduct targeted bombings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group builds IEDs locally, including drivable SVBIEDs. A known master bomb maker may be present. There may be evidence of research and development for weapons of mass destruction, demonstrated success at technical innovation, and use of SVBIED waves and major explosives as part of a coordinated military offensive or defensive operation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group builds IEDs locally, possibly including drivable and up-armored SVBIEDs, or there may be evidence of training or studying from a master bomb maker or demonstrated attempts to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group employs remote-detonated or other immobile IEDs; uses found explosives, land mines, and suicide vests; or has demonstrated capability at the “red” or “orange” level more than three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group does not use explosive devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to Weapons Systems.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor indicates a group’s access to and ability to use weapons systems effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group modifies drones to drop explosives or has confirmed or is likely to access man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group demonstrated access to weapons systems at the “red” level more than three years ago. It may have access to MANPADs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group uses commercial drones for surveillance. It has used rockets, mortars, or other heavy fires in the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group uses small arms only.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sophisticated Tactics.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor approximates the group’s level of military sophistication as a ground force. Groups may develop more advanced tactics with time — for example, combining skilled-fire teams with vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) to breach hard targets. Sophisticated tactics in theater also potentially indicate a latent transnational terror attack capability. The 2015 Islamic State Paris attack is an example of trained fighters from specialized military units adapting their skills for terror attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group uses VBIEDs and drones to support large-scale infantry operations. It may have effectively exported tactical teams to another country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group conducts complex attacks combining explosives and tactical teams to breach hard targets or coordinate attacks with multiple VBIEDs and other increasingly complex attacks, such as secondary bombings targeting first responders and geographically separated attacks on hard targets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group conducts simultaneous small-arms attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group is not using sophisticated tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Force Projection (Within Country).&lt;/strong&gt; This factor indicates a group’s ability to conduct military operations and terror attacks beyond its immediate area of operations within a country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group can sustain ground offensives in multiple distinct geographic areas, or it credibly threatens population centers of high priority to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group can wage a ground insurgency in one area and conduct intermittent terror attacks or raids in other areas, or it can sustain operations across a large geographic area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group can conduct brief simultaneous attacks in geographically separate locations, has demonstrated a recent but now suppressed capability to sustain attacks in multiple locations, or can sustain a terror network while under pressure in its primary area of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group is constrained to a local area, and any terror networks it maintains in other areas are largely dormant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional Force Projection (Cross Border).&lt;/strong&gt; This factor indicates a group’s ability to conduct terror attacks and conventional military operations across international borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group sustains a consistent insurgency across an international border or has expanded across international borders and established new enduring bases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group makes cross-border incursions or runs terror networks in neighboring countries from its primary area of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group uses smuggling routes or support zones in a border region and has not attacked in a neighboring country in the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group’s activities are confined to a single country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Terror Attack Capability.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor indicates whether a group is capable of transnational terror attacks beyond its immediate country or region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group has conducted or directly facilitated an attack outside its region on an international or transnational target in the past three years, or more than one successful individual attacker has credited the group for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group has actively attempted one or more attacks outside its region, including advanced plots interdicted in early stages, or an individual attacker has credited the group for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group or individuals connected to it have attempted poorly designed attacks abroad, or the group conducted or directly facilitated one or more transnational terror attacks more than three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group has not been connected to any attacks abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elite Units.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers the presence of military units to carry out more specialized and sensitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group has one or more units focused on external terror attacks either regionally or transnationally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group has one or more units focused on specialized functions such as counterintelligence, innovation and weapons development, or training, including either training foreign fighters for other conflicts or dispatching trainers to other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group has a unit with special attack capabilities in either conventional fighting or terror attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group has no specialized units.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers the group’s ability to access resources to sustain or enhance its efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group has a tax base and access to or dominance of economic networks. It likely has excess funds for operational planning or supporting other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group has access to economic networks, or it may receive funds from other Salafi-jihadi groups or financiers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group’s economic resources are likely limited but sufficient for survival and baseline recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group is isolated and struggles to access sufficient resources to sustain its membership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permissive Environment.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers the group’s access to areas with ineffective security forces and havens outside state control. It also considers recent man-made or natural crises that create a window of vulnerability for all or part of the population. This factor approximates whether an environment is permissive by combining three criteria defined in &lt;em&gt;The Underestimated Insurgency: African States at Risk for Salafi-Jihadi Insurgencies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ineffective Security Forces.&lt;/em&gt; This criterion uses a measure of a country’s monopoly on the use of force as a proxy for security force capability. These data are from 2020. Where indicated, the author has adjusted the assessment to 2022 to account for overt changes in the use of force in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: Monopoly on use of force ranking in the range of 0–2.5.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: 2.6–5.0.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: 5.1–7.5.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: 7.6–10.0.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncontrolled Areas.&lt;/em&gt; This criterion considers the degree to which a state controls the territory in its borders. It also considers the relative importance of that territory and the state’s degree of access to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: Terrain actively controlled by a force hostile to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: Populated terrain with limited access for government forces and personnel, with government and insurgent forces contesting control of that terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: Sparsely populated terrain outside government control and ongoing intercommunal conflicts that the government cannot or chooses not to intervene in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: Not applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vulnerability Window.&lt;/em&gt; This criterion refers to a recent change in position or security for all or part of the population, including armed conflict, mass political unrest, natural disasters, and humanitarian crises. This criterion also considers influxes of refugees and migrants as potentially destabilizing incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: Man-made or natural crisis in the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: Man-made or natural crisis in the past year or forecast crisis with medium-high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: Man-made or natural crisis in the past two years or forecast crisis with low-medium confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: Not applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;organizational-factors&quot;&gt;Organizational Factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors consider a group’s ability to coordinate people toward its goals, both by managing its internal processes and through its interactions with other organizations. These criteria also consider groups’ contributions to the broader Salafi-jihadi movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force Generation.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers a group’s ability to build and regenerate a fighting force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group has training camps, possibly with foreign recruits, and there is evidence of growing membership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: Limited information indicates that the group may have training camps, foreign recruits, or growing membership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group’s size is steady, there is no significant indication of membership growing or decreasing, or there is insufficient data to judge group size.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group is losing members to arrests, attacks, or defections, or the group suffered significant losses in recent years and does not appear to be recovering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilience or Adaptability.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers whether a group has overcome a major military setback or adapted in response to pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group has overcome a setback, such as the loss of terrain or its initial leaders, and returned at a level equal to or above preceding the setback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group lost capability in its initial area of operations but shifted elsewhere, or it has sustained a territorial insurgency under significant military pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group has lost military capability but sustains as a terror attack network, or it encountered pressure and significantly reduced its area of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group has not yet come under pressure, or it has become dormant for at least a year after coming under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Integration and Amplification.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers whether a group effectively draws on or contributes to larger Salafi-jihadi networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group sends fighters to other groups and helps start or seed new Salafi-jihadi franchises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group sends trainers, media expertise, and weapons experts to other groups; receives foreign fighters for training; or plays a coordinating role for other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group receives training, delegations, media coordination or amplification, and money or weapons from other groups. It may have changed its name or formal affiliation or rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group may receive superficial media attention from Salafi-jihadi publications but otherwise receives no support from other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitors and Infighting.&lt;/strong&gt; This factor considers the role of intergroup relations. Competition between Salafi-jihadi groups can be destructive and constrain a group’s ability to pursue its governance and military goals, but it can also empower more radical factions and encourage defections between groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red: The group is collaborating or deconflicting with Salafi-jihadi rivals against shared adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orange: The group has a local Salafi-jihadi rival but is either successfully repressing or absorbing its rival or increasing its overall rate and scale of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yellow: The group is dedicating some energy to quelling infighting but has not split, or it has no local Salafi-jihadi rivals or apparent infighting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Green: The group is primarily preoccupied with infighting, including targeting spies and defectors, or it is suppressed by rival Salafi-jihadi groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Resilience should be reconceptualized as the individual and collective capacity to withstand, fight through, and quickly recover from disruption caused by military and non-military threats to Euro-Atlantic security from authoritarian actors and strategic competitors as well as global challenges. It merits a top priority in NATO and national planning, significant investment in building Europe’s credible resilience posture, and new approaches to amplifying allies’ combined capacity to tackle shared challenges and threats as well as increasing vigilance amid heightened tensions. Creating a NATO Resilience Planning Process akin to the NATO Defence Planning Process will be instrumental in harmonizing and integrating national resilience plans, strategies, and capabilities to marshal NATO’s strong collective response. In addition, a high-level resilience task force should be created to identify multidimensional resilience lessons from Ukraine across the spectrum of conventional, hybrid, and societal threats, as well as to make recommendations for future policies and investments that will bolster European resilience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;european-resilience-in-light-of-russias-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;European Resilience in Light of Russia’s War in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine has been the trigger for a reshaping of European self-defense. Confronted with the immediate danger Russia represents, European nations have begun rethinking national security objectives and commitments, reinforcing military strength, and providing political and financial support as well as an unprecedented supply of advanced weapons to Ukraine. Finland and Sweden have applied for NATO membership, after decades (in the case of Finland) or even centuries (for Sweden) of neutrality. Denmark has lifted its 30-year opt-out from the EU Common Security and Defence Policy. Germany is planning to beef up its defense spending and modernize its forces after years of underspending and neglect. Poland is making unparalleled investments in its defense capabilities, doubling its army from 150,000 to 300,000 soldiers and championing military aid to Ukraine. And Ukraine itself has been granted official EU candidate nation status and applied for accelerated NATO accession. In effect, a common threat has served to unite NATO and the European Union in a way that previous debates about developing a common security policy had not. Epitomized by German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s characterization of this development as “Zeitenwende” — a historic turning point — in his address to the Bundestag’s emergency session on February 27, this resurgence of traditional security threats brings defense collaboration to the top of the political agenda in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reshaping of European self-defense thus creates an opportunity for innovation that goes beyond measuring nations’ investments into their capabilities and forces. While European nations have individual policies about their defense forces and resources, there are many benefits that accrue from identifying, considering, and building on interdependencies and interconnectedness. Deepening collaboration between like-minded nations can provide credible military options and faster decisionmaking to respond to a wide range of contingencies, both in peacetime and at times of crisis or conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these interdependencies align with questions about resilience. The concept of resilience — incorporating military capacity, civil preparedness, and emergency planning — was central to the Cold War narrative as a first line of defense against the Soviet Union. Moored into Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty, it committed allies to “separately and jointly, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, . . . maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, concerns about resilience took a back seat to other issues. They have a new salience today. Russia’s aggression against Ukraine joins the Covid-19 pandemic, intensified geostrategic competition with China, technological advancement, and climate change to underscore the need to better prepare for disruption, pervasive instability, strategic shocks, emerging vulnerabilities, and persistent threats. By their very nature, those overwhelming systemic challenges are far greater than any nation can address on its own and involve interests vital to the security and well-being of all European and North American allies. Moreover, as Ganesh Sitaraman observed in his 2020 Foreign Affairs essay, “what unites those seemingly disparate threats is that each is not so much a battle to be won as a challenge to be weathered.” Enduring them requires constant adaptation and agility, as well as the ability to understand shortfalls and vulnerabilities and the willingness and means to address them head-on. And while not free of cost, it is well worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current crisis makes a clear case for building and bolstering resilience in peacetime and coordinating resources, capabilities, supply chains, and logistics across the alliance. Allocating adequate resources to enhancing the ability to absorb strategic shocks can make a crucial difference in winning a war before it begins. Thus, resilience — while primarily a national responsibility that requires political commitment, investment, supporting organization, and prioritization — must become a collective imperative, especially since many resilience challenges cross national borders. The 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy (NDS) advances a focus on resilience and collaboration with allies and partners to deter aggression and promote peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area. Moreover, the NDS broadens the concept of NATO collective security commitment to include — on top of conventional deterrence and defense — working alongside allies to build resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This signals a major shift toward embracing resilience as essential to amplifying the combined capacity of allied nations to tackle shared challenges and threats. Consequently, resilience cannot be solely defined as a function of society’s ability to resist and recover from shocks as it is set forth by NATO in current documents. Rather, reflecting the North Atlantic Treaty obligations and the prevailing threat landscape, resilience should be conceptualized as the alliance members’ individual and collective capacity to withstand, fight through, and quickly recover from disruption caused by military and non-military threats to Euro-Atlantic security from authoritarian actors and strategic competitors as well as global challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;existing-nato-resilience-efforts&quot;&gt;Existing NATO Resilience Efforts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has brought into sharper focus the fact that military resilience overlaps with broader societal resilience requirements. It has highlighted the pressing need to address these wider interdependencies and identify vulnerabilities to disruption that can have cascading effects across societies and economies. In his October 2020 speech, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg observed that “having a strong military is fundamental to our security, but our military cannot be strong if our societies are weak.” Ukraine’s heroic fight underscores that a robust national resistance strategy based on a whole-of-society ability to signal strength to the adversary while augmenting the effects of posture can make a crucial difference in responding to acute crises and threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is existing groundwork for pursuing new thinking about resilience. Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its increasingly aggressive tactics shattered the 1989 vision offered by President George H.W. Bush of a Europe “whole, free, and at peace” facing little threat of a conventional attack. After two decades of shifting its role from collective deterrence and territorial defense against the Soviet Union to undertaking crisis management operations outside its traditional operational theater, NATO was confronted with Russia’s heightened threat to Euro-Atlantic security and stability. And it was woefully underprepared to handle a crisis unfolding on its doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the alliance embarked on reinforcing its posture. A growing number of allies also began to recognize resilience as essential to developing effective deterrence and reassurance measures, which can be part of a comprehensive security strategy as well as instrumental to tackling mounting societal vulnerabilities. At the 2016 NATO summit in Warsaw, the alliance’s Heads of State and Government noted that “civil preparedness is a central pillar of Allies’ resilience and a critical enabler for Alliance collective defense.” To improve civil preparedness, allies agreed on seven NATO baseline requirements (see text box) for national resilience that serve also as a framework to support the effective enablement of NATO forces to ensure the collective defense and security of all allies. These are centered around continuity of government, essential services to the population, and civil support to the military that must be maintained in times of crisis. In addition, at the 2021 Brussels summit, allies endorsed the Strengthened Resilience Commitment and Proposal 3 for improved resilience under the NATO 2030 Agenda. This acted as an acknowledgment that safeguarding the alliance’s societies, populations, and shared values requires a new and broader understanding of the importance of national and collective resilience as well as civil preparedness. To address specific challenges, allies agreed to intensify efforts to secure and diversify supply chains, ensure the resilience of critical infrastructure and key industries, and direct attention to the impact of natural hazards compounded by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;seven-nato-baseline-requirements-for-national-resilience&quot;&gt;Seven NATO Baseline Requirements for National Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assured continuity of government and critical government services: for instance the ability to make decisions, communicate them and enforce them in a crisis;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resilient energy supplies: back-up plans and power grids, internally and across borders;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ability to deal effectively with uncontrolled movement of people, and to de-conflict these movements from NATO’s military deployments;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resilient food and water resources: ensuring these supplies are safe from disruption or sabotage;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ability to deal with mass casualties and disruptive health crises: ensuring that civilian health systems can cope and that sufficient medical supplies are stocked and secure;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resilient civil communications systems: ensuring that telecommunications and cyber networks function even under crisis conditions, with sufficient back-up capacity;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resilient transport systems: ensuring that NATO forces can move across Alliance territory rapidly and that civilian services can rely on transportation networks, even in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience was also prominently featured in the discussions leading to the adoption of the 2022 NATO Strategic Concept, which serves as blueprint that will profoundly shape how NATO and its allies think about addressing security challenges for a decade to come. Some experts argued that building comprehensive resilience to disruptive threats to allied societies should be added as a core task for the alliance — alongside collective defense, cooperative security, and crisis management. The new Strategic Concept agreed upon by the NATO Heads of State and Government at the Madrid summit in June 2022 acknowledges resilience as a key issue for the alliance. Although it falls short of explicitly designating it as a fourth core task, it highlights the need to “pursue a more robust, integrated, and coherent approach to building national and alliance-wide resilience.” The Strategic Concept also notes that resilience is critical to tackling both military and non-military threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;establishing-a-nato-resilience-planning-process&quot;&gt;Establishing a NATO Resilience Planning Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breadth of these efforts at the highest political levels of the alliance is an indicator of the nations’ and NATO’s understanding of the importance of resilience. However, these mostly top-down policy-focused statements lack robust implementation plans to achieve a desired strategic and operational intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO has developed an initial set of evaluation criteria to facilitate national resilience self-assessment efforts, and it has been appraising the state of the alliance’s resilience every two years since 2018. However, many shortfalls remain. The inability to effectively tackle the persistent challenges of increasingly contested logistics, vulnerable transport infrastructure, dependence on Russian gas supplies, and the emergence of cyber and hybrid threats points to the stressors across the alliance. Left unaddressed, these challenges will almost certainly result in weakening NATO’s response to unfolding crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO is therefore confronted with the urgent task of operationalizing collective resilience objectives and enacting nationally developed goals as well as robust follow-through mechanisms to assess, review, and monitor progress. Recent decisions to voluntarily share data on national policies and plans are encouraging, but their nonmandatory and discretionary nature makes it difficult to identify existing national resilience shortfalls and generate a comprehensive and complete picture of the stress points that can undermine shared resilience. Moreover, the majority of NATO allies do not have resilience plans, nor do they have resilience organization in place. The fragmented and uneven nature of resilience building efforts, policies, investments, and activities across the alliance shows that these priorities need to be aligned in a more integrated manner — and tailored to specific threats and challenges — in order to combine and coordinate allies’ strengths to maximum effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NATO is therefore confronted with the urgent task of operationalizing collective resilience objectives and enacting nationally developed goals as well as robust follow-through mechanisms to assess, review, and monitor progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a system in place that can be used as a model for new resilience policies. The NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) works to “provide a framework within which national and Alliance defence planning activities can be harmonised to enable Allies to provide the required forces and capabilities in the most effective way.” However, if incorporated directly into NDPP — a complex and already overstretched process encompassing 14 different defense planning domains — resilience will always take a back seat and not receive the attention it requires. Moreover, the problem set and the expertise needed to address resilience requirements are different. Therefore the development of a new NATO Resilience Planning Process following the NDPP methodology would be much more effective in harmonizing and integrating national resilience plans, strategies, and capabilities to marshal NATO’s strong and collective resilience posture. A key goal of the NATO Resilience Planning Process would be to ensure that the new process can drive both national and collective resilience requirements and help achieve more effective unity of effort. As planning for resilience, both in qualitative and quantitative terms, goes beyond the realm of defense budgets, standing up a distinct — yet familiar — framework will help convert political will into tangible commitments and increased resilience capabilities. Alliance-wide resilience planning will be vital in helping to influence national behaviors and allocate adequate resources by incorporating NATO resilience guidelines into national strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, the NATO Resilience Planning Process could hew closely to the NDPP’s five-step approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-1-establish-political-guidance-and-set-priorities&quot;&gt;STEP 1: ESTABLISH POLITICAL GUIDANCE AND SET PRIORITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to incorporate resilience questions into top-level political guidance documents, which NATO produces every four years. The political guidance derives from higher-level strategic policy and is a single cohesive framework that lays out the overall aims and objectives that the alliance must meet in the next five to ten years. Future political guidance documents — including the upcoming 2023 political guidance — should include specific objectives for resilience. Along with the operational level of ambition (defined as the number, scale, and nature of the operations that the alliance should be able to conduct in the future, along with the capability requirements needed to support them and the associated priorities and timelines), it should include a resilience level of ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-2-determine-requirements-to-meet-nato-resilience-level-of-ambition&quot;&gt;STEP 2: DETERMINE REQUIREMENTS TO MEET NATO RESILIENCE LEVEL OF AMBITION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytic work will be necessary for developing and defining a consolidated list of minimum resilience requirements. This should be the full set of resilience capabilities and assets that NATO needs if it is to support the effective enablement of its forces to ensure the collective defense and security of all allies. Juxtaposing these requirements with existing or already planned capabilities (national, multinational, or common-funded) will be instrumental in identifying resilience shortfalls across the alliance. This should include baseline national requirements and recommendations for cross-cutting layered resilience across national borders. The requirements should be updated every four years, following the recommendations in the political guidance documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-3-apportion-resilience-requirements-and-set-targets&quot;&gt;STEP 3: APPORTION RESILIENCE REQUIREMENTS AND SET TARGETS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next step starts the implementation process by defining specific goals. These minimum resilience requirement targets should have associated priorities and timelines and should allow for innovative solutions rather than requiring specific approaches. They can be allocated to allies either individually, multinationally, or collectively, and they should follow the principles of fair burden sharing and reasonable challenge to determine the contributions of individual nations. The NATO resource committee can decide which resilience investments are eligible for common funding so as to provide additional support for the goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-4-facilitate-implementation&quot;&gt;STEP 4: FACILITATE IMPLEMENTATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framework will provide a new context for resilience activities. Investments in capabilities like energy and cybersecurity are not new to the allies, but connecting them into an overarching capability framework will require new approaches to implementation and measurement. This will be most effective if NATO can provide continuous assistance to allies in implementing the targets. This can include facilitating multinational initiatives and streamlining NATO efforts to help nations address priority resilience shortfalls and share best practices. NATO may need to invest in a new central resilience organization to support national efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-5-review-results-and-offer-additional-support-where-needed&quot;&gt;STEP 5: REVIEW RESULTS AND OFFER ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WHERE NEEDED&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting clear goals should facilitate periodic assessments of how NATO’s resilience objectives, ambitions, and targets are being met. The goals of this assessment can include identifying shortfalls, which may mean that new strategies or support structures will be needed — and that allies will require financial support to overcome these shortfalls. However, a periodic assessment could also offer a pathway for seeking out success stories and useful insights on a regular basis, lessons that will then be able to be rolled out to other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;additional-resources-and-strategies-needed-for-implementation&quot;&gt;Additional Resources and Strategies Needed for Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Step 4 suggests, facilitating implementation will require support structures, both at the NATO level and at the national level. Allies will need to invest in NATO’s capacity to provide a platform for political consultation and collective action on resilience, support resilience efforts on an alliance level, and strengthen national capabilities, especially when it comes to smaller states. The recently established NATO Resilience Committee is one approach. Chaired by the assistant secretary general for defense policy and planning and reporting directly to the North Atlantic Council, the committee should be further strengthened and given a clear mandate to provide strategic and policy advice and planning guidance, as well as coherence for resilience activities across NATO. But NATO committees often face system- and process-level constraints that limit their ability to act with authority. To overcome these, NATO needs empowered senior leadership and champions from both senior military and civilian officials to give resilience issues greater visibility and accountability and drive forward progress, including identifying and naming a senior official with the specific responsibility and authority to oversee and ensure coherence between civilian and military collective resilience efforts. Senior national officials for resilience, who met for the first time on November 16, 2022, should focus on coordinating interagency efforts at national levels and on developing concrete deliverables for NATO and allies. Moreover, clearly defining collective objectives that the alliance must pursue to strengthen resilience will be key to ensuring tangible and timely progress — and this needs to happen before the NATO Vilnius summit next July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A next step would be to ensure that NATO can draw on national resilience capabilities in crisis situations and create a rapid response capability or crisis center focused on resilience support in emergency situations or contingencies. NATO has existing models for this, including a NATO rapid reaction team designed to fight cyberattacks. It also recently sent counter hybrid warfare support teams to both Lithuania and Montenegro. The creation of policies to support the creation of similar resilience-focused crisis response teams that could be deployed within 24 hours would speed recovery from disruption. This resilience rapid response capability should be exercised regularly to develop and ensure efficacy, with the goal of becoming part of Europe’s deterrence posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these efforts span multiple domains and involve cross-cutting issues, improved civil-military coordination amid increasing demands on NATO forces and the civil sector in times of crises to ensure uninterrupted provision of vital services is key. While NATO continues to cope with day-to day resilience challenges, such as cyberattacks or acts of sabotage against critical infrastructure, it is time to also lay the foundation for a longer-term resilience strategy. This will allow NATO to be more proactive and better prepared to more effectively build enduring resilience, rather than focusing on being reactive to crises. In addition, embedding military resilience in the broader context of collective resilience will be vital to absorb the full range of future threats. In order to help ensure greater coherence across military and civilian dimension of resilience, more synergies are needed with the military concepts that set the direction for NATO’s ongoing adaptation: the Concept for Deterrence and Defense of the Euro-Atlantic Area, which focuses on force employment to deter and defend today, and the NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept, which outlines a vision to guide the alliance’s long-term warfare development. In particular, NATO should further leverage efforts undertaken by the Allied Command Transformation to develop the notion of layered resilience, as part of the NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept. Encompassing logistics, warfighting capability, perseverance, military infrastructure, situational awareness, command and control, and response planning, layered resilience underscores the interconnected nature of military and civilian resilience. Both are necessary — and mutually reinforcing — to build the ability to withstand immediate shocks and disruptions over long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s attack on Ukraine has led to the largest war in Europe since 1945. This conflict is the most recent and most relevant operation of its kind, and it possesses an unprecedented potential to develop useful lessons for building resilience against further Russian aggression and gray zone coercion. However, this will not happen without sustained, deliberate, and focused effort. To ensure that it is done effectively, the North Atlantic Council should stand up a high-level resilience task force to identify preliminary resilience lessons from Ukraine across the spectrum of conventional, hybrid, and societal threats, as well as to make recommendations for future policies and investments that can bolster European resilience. Alternatively, the United States could take the lead on creating such a task force with the goal of bolstering European resilience and strengthening NATO’s ability to respond to crises, allowing the United States to take more of a “reinsurer” role under Article 3 rather than acting as a first line of defense. The FY 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, currently in deliberations, could be the opportunity to initiate such a task force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A serious implementation concern is always funding. New policies and organizational structures are never free. However, developing the required policies and structures for increased resilience represents a marginal cost when compared to national efforts already in place or required by NATO guidance. While NATO HQ and International Staff funding can be contentious, at the end of the day, NATO nations get value from their investments. Resilience is too important a task to be absorbed by existing staff and processes, and NATO members must be prepared to allocate the marginal resources needed to support efforts to strengthen resilience. New capital investments in ensuring operational resilience will be the greater cost — but NATO has shown that it is willing to make investments to support its priorities, including the recent standup of a €1 billion innovation fund. The Defense Investment Pledge (DIP), adopted by NATO leaders in 2014, framed the political narrative on transatlantic burden sharing and committed allies to spending at least 2 percent of GDP on defense within the next decade. At the Madrid summit, allies decided to build on that pledge to ensure that increased national defense spending and NATO common funding would be “commensurate with the challenges of a more contested security order.” One question for NATO to decide as an alliance within the next year is to what extent subsequent commitments beyond 2024 should reflect resilience. Investing in resilience should be a priority and resilience expenditures should be in addition to other commitments, and this may require the development of a robust methodology to determine national contributions to collective resilience. This also spotlights an opportunity to shift the political narrative from transatlantic burden sharing to a more unified alliance prepared to share the responsibilities and risks flowing from a volatile security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing Russia’s threat requires not only refocusing allied nations’ capabilities and military readiness but also reframing collective resilience as something centered around the same principles as collective defense — which “binds its members together, committing them to protect each other and setting a spirit of solidarity within the alliance.” Thus, building capacity along Europe’s eastern flank and further strengthening resilience would benefit from the creation of a NATO Resilience Fund. Such a fund, established to directly support the resilience capacity of the most vulnerable allies and priority partner nations, would also significantly contribute to reinforcing deterrence, including deterrence in the face of Russian threat. As the European Union is increasingly acting in a complementary role to NATO’s security objectives, improved cooperation between EU institutions and NATO will help enhance the efficacy of resilience initiatives in Europe. Identifying concrete steps and effective synergies — especially between NATO’s baseline requirements for national resilience and the European Union’s critical entities resilience directive — as well as continuing work within a formal structured dialogue on resilience and civil preparedness will further increase the coherence of efforts in an already constrained environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost-effective and creative ideas can come from many places, and many solutions are likely to be offered by and sourced from industry, especially as many resilience assets are owned by the private sector. Setting up a NATO-industry resilience partnership early will ensure that the government requirement-setting process benefits from a clear understanding of current capabilities, knowledge of industry trends, and access to private sector resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As observed by General Christopher G. Cavoli, NATO’s supreme allied commander, Europe, the Ukraine crisis has demonstrated that these complex and interrelated challenges demand “whole-of-government, whole-of-nation, whole-of-alliance efforts.” NATO as an alliance and its member nations have the rare opportunity to learn from a serious conflict with a persistent adversary in their own backyard. Focusing on lessons learned is a strategic imperative, both for planning for future warfighting operations and for understanding how and where to invest in resilience to ensure that allies can “maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack,” as called for in Article 3. The need to respond to multiple contingencies at short notice, while building up the ability to withstand and recover quickly from disruptions, has become the new normal amid strategic competition. This newfound urgency to act decisively — not in the distant future but in the next few years — requires not only political will but also sustained commitment and considerable resources, as well as improved coordination at national and alliance levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the pronounced imbalance between high-level political statements and current resilience posture, a robust, coherent, and purpose-driven process is needed to achieve the strategic and operational intent of decisions taken at NATO summits and ministerial meetings. Collective resilience is not only a function of burden sharing. It entails high levels of responsibility and risk sharing, and it deserves a distinct approach. Creating a NATO Resilience Planning Process will be instrumental in harmonizing and integrating national resilience plans, strategies, and capabilities to marshal NATO’s strong collective response. Following the model of the NATO Defense Planning Process will allow the new approach to align with an accepted strategy that has organizational support, which will help smooth the path to effective implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive approach to resilience must also embrace additional resources and strategies, notably development of clearly defined objectives, creation of a rapid response capability, improved civil-military coordination, and robust investment. Implementation should include the establishment of a high-level resilience task force overseen by a new senior official with the specific responsibility and authority to ensure coherence between civilian and military collective resilience efforts. As Russia and other strategic competitors continue to aggressively exploit vulnerabilities, a lack of appropriate urgency in bolstering collective resilience in Europe will imperil the alliance’s ability to effectively address the looming threats.&lt;/p&gt;

Having a supportive policy environment can help high-potential businesses accelerate. Creating such an environment is a shared responsibility of both the central government and India’s 28 states.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many state governments in India have piecemeal policies and programs to support micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). About one-third of India’s states have worked to craft multifaceted and supportive policies and practices to encourage MSME growth. This paper reviews the ideas already enacted in different Indian states, as well as in national and subnational governments around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing a single comprehensive MSME policy is an effective approach for a state-level government to consider. It allows small firms to find policy incentives and programs in a single place, and perhaps most importantly, it allows a state to directly consider a range of intertwined incentives that can work together. This will maximize the positive impact to small firms that are poised for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facilitating the growth of MSMEs will have a much wider impact on India’s job growth overall. The large multinational manufacturers that India hopes to attract to invest through programs like Make in India require a diverse and efficient network of suppliers. Supporting MSME growth can create a multiplier effect — driving new investment and employment generation by larger firms. The central government has affirmed a 25 percent target of gross domestic product (GDP) for manufacturing, up from approximately14 percent today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper provides leading international examples in the promotion of small businesses, while also enumerating best practices from Indian states’ MSME policies. The final section lays out the 30 elements commonly utilized by Indian states to offer targeted assistance to MSMEs as a roadmap for other states that want to provide best-in-class policy interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: In some instances, in this paper, the term small and medium enterprises (SME) is used instead of MSME. SME removes the “micro” sized firms which often have specific needs and are too small to avail some support programs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elements-and-impacts-of-comprehensive-msme-policies&quot;&gt;Elements and Impacts of Comprehensive MSME Policies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-importance-of-small-businesses&quot;&gt;The Importance of Small Businesses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small business policies are considered an important part of most countries’ industrial policy due to MSMEs’ job generation capacity. The Indian government estimates the nation hosts around 60 million MSMEs, which collectively employ 111 million people — around 25 percent of total national employment. MSMEs contribute 28 percent of GDP and 40 percent of India’s exports. Of these categories, “micro” firms (less than 600,000 USD in turnover) make up approximately 95 percent of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job creation is crucial as India slowly undertakes agricultural reforms. Today, India’s agriculture sector employs approximately 43 percent of workers, yet produces less than 17 percent of GDP. While the Indian government backed down from a package of agriculture reforms in 2021, smaller reforms continue to provide space for Indian farmers to expand and improve productivity. This would likely cause further reductions in farm workers — and a widening pool of semi-skilled and unskilled laborers that will need to be absorbed by other parts of the economy. Some initial reports about “post-Covid-19” economic shifts indicate that seasonal workers are finding lower-paying roles than in previous off-seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is in the middle of a substantial realignment of global supply chains. Rising labor costs, trade imbalances, and security concerns have all collided to force companies to consider supply hubs outside of China. Often, Indian officials seek to court large manufacturers to consider new investments. They note the steady liberalization of foreign direct investment (FDI) policies, India’s improved rankings in global business indices, and the growing domestic market. However, another element large manufacturers must consider is the health of the supplier ecosystem. For example, Ford Motor Company notes that they have around 1,200 Tier 1 production suppliers. Boeing has over 11,000 Tier 1 suppliers globally. Lockheed Martin notes a network of 15,800 active suppliers. Procter &amp;amp; Gamble boasts of a network of more than 60,000 suppliers. For firms like these, having a network of suppliers ready to grow commensurately can improve Indian states’ overall attractiveness as a manufacturing hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s state governments should also carefully consider policies that support young MSMEs but do not create constraints to continued growth. Globally, older small firms have less impact on job creation than either young firms or larger firms, so governments should choose policy options that avoid creating a “growth trap.” Policies should be framed in a manner as to encourage continued growth instead of stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-specialized-needs-of-smaller-firms&quot;&gt;The Specialized Needs of Smaller Firms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after 30 years of liberalization, firms of every size in India can list a range of issues that preclude their growth. Some of these are policy issues, while others are operational issues such as low quality infrastructure. While much of this list is shared with larger firms, some of these factors have a more acute impact on smaller firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some key examples of the operational barriers that often have an outsized impact on smaller firms include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weak electric power grids: Larger firms may have the capacity to invest in independent electric power sources. Smaller firms are less likely to be able to invest in such capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Water systems: Many industries require purified water as part of their manufacturing processes. Larger firms may have the capacity to invest in improved water sources or in improving the quality of municipal water, while smaller firms are less likely to be able to do so. This is also true for the treatment of effluent discharge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal restitution of business disputes: As business disputes occur, larger firms have more negotiating clout and may be able to resolve disputes before going to court. If they do go to court, larger firms have the capacity to hire the best legal counsel and wait longer periods for decisions. For smaller firms, securing legal restitution through the courts can cause tremendous hardship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Access to information: Indian state policies can be difficult to find, even online. Smaller firms may not be aware of government policies and programs meant to accelerate their growth and improve operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;State compliances: Larger firms are more likely to have a focused team that can complete state compliances in areas such as taxation, labor, and environmental regulation. For smaller firms, such compliances place a real burden on management, distracting from other critical operational issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Access to resources or inputs: Larger firms will have a greater capacity to negotiate with resource and input providers. Larger firms may offer advantages to a supplier such as pricing, transparency, size of supply contract, length of supply contract, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Climate change mitigation: As governments increase actions to combat the sources of climate change, firms may be asked to bear short-term expenses to reduce emissions. This could deeply impact smaller firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is far from exhaustive but provides some idea of how the business environment impacts firms of different sizes differently. Some surveys of MSMEs expand this list much further — studying topics such as labor unrest, availability of raw materials, and other issues where supportive government policies will need to be more creative and nuanced. Government policymakers should bear this in mind when looking for ways to boost job creation. Compared to large firms, smaller firms may not have the capacity to regularly petition the government on business affairs, so it will take greater effort to learn about the constraints smaller firms face — and how interventions can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some recent surveys of small businesses in various geographies point to the difficulties faced by small firms and the effectiveness of various government interventions. Naturally, recent surveys must take into account the unusual factor of the Covid-19 pandemic. But across geographies and national income levels, it is striking — despite different types of questions, firms, and more — that similar issues are prioritized by MSMEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;existing-policy-interventions-of-indian-states&quot;&gt;Existing Policy Interventions of Indian States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten of India’s 28 states have overarching MSME policies, either as standalone policies or as a focus section in the state’s larger industrial policy framework. Of these 10, 4 are expired and others were drafted by previous governments. The five states with “live” policies drafted by the incumbent governments are Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. The Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat MSME policy incentives are included in these states’ wider industrial policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, every Indian state offers programmatic and policy support to nurture MSMEs, but such policies are rarely developed as part of an overarching MSME policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five themes are commonly found in existing states’ MSME policies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Financial Support: Assisting with MSME finances through funding support, reimbursements, and financial incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compliance and Regulatory Support: Offering measures to reduce the burden and cost of compliance. This often takes the forms of reduced paperwork or subsidies related to costs like registrations, certifications, power charges, state taxes, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infrastructure Support: Improving MSME infrastructure access through MSME cluster or park development. Also, offering concessions for availing infrastructure or providing a seat in existing state infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marketing Support: Improving MSME’s marketing efforts through state procurement and market linkages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boosting Central Government MSME Programs: Strengthening MSME development institutes and facilitating central MSME schemes, including funding schemes and distressed asset schemes specifically. Also includes establishing or strengthening MSME facilitation councils in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies and programs require regular monitoring and impact assessments to ensure that they are being carried out successfully at the envisioned scale and are positively impacting the desired groups. The ultimate goal is facilitating business survival, business expansion, and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best programs and administrators ensure that monitoring mechanisms require relatively low effort beyond the initial setup. For instance, several U.S. states integrate public procurement portals with small business targeting programs so that progress dashboards are easy to track, and course corrections can be made. An example is the Statewide Procurement Data Dashboards from California — which is made publicly available to improve accountability. Another example is the COSTARS program in Pennsylvania, which connects buyers and sellers and has built-in tools to track the types of firms that are winning contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some country-wide examples of policy and programmatic interventions that have been linked to positive outcomes for small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;brazil&quot;&gt;Brazil&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SMEs receiving credit support experienced a 15 percent increase in their number of workers (three jobs per establishment on average).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SMEs participating in a credit program observed a 2.4 percent increase in wages and an increase in the value of exports and trademark registrations. For every 1,000 firms receiving credit support, on average, about two of them registered a trademark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SMEs receiving export support increased employees by 11 percent on average and created an average of 2.6 jobs per establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, export support led to six additional trademarks registered for every 1,000 establishments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;argentina&quot;&gt;Argentina&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Argentine SME support programs increased employment, real wages, and the probability of exporting by 14.3 percent, 1.4 percent, and 1.8 percent respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turkey&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SME policies on innovation found that access to capital, regional innovation programs, and institution-industry collaboration led to greater innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nigeria&quot;&gt;Nigeria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A 2015 World Bank report notes the successes of Nigeria’s Youth Enterprise with Innovation (YouWiN) program for start-ups, which awards companies a $50,000 prize. Existing firms that have won the contest have a 20 percent higher likelihood of being operational three years later, a 21 percent higher chance that the firm crosses the 10-employee threshold, and a 25 percent increase in profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A 2012 study published in Science indicates one-time transfers to microenterprises in Srilanka is linked to higher survival rates and higher profits.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-key-elements-of-a-state-msme-policy&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations: Key Elements of a State MSME Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; The states should survey small firms to gauge the primary areas where policy reform and programmatic support will have the biggest impact. They should further build a framework that incorporates accountability tools to track implementation and create a review mechanism to assess the impact of the policy on business survival, business growth, and job creation. The states should also consider appropriate methods for educating the public about these initiatives so that they are taken up by small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MSME model policy constituents:&lt;/strong&gt; The model MSME policy contains various elements emanating from the six policy pillars outlined earlier in this report. Indian states are highly encouraged to implement a comprehensive policy encompassing all 30 elements listed below, prioritizing areas that are recognized as particularly crucial in individual states. Within a state, some policies may be reserved or augmented for targeted classes of individuals or less-developed regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financial-support&quot;&gt;Financial Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reduce fees for initial company registration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offer direct subsidies for new investments in plants, property, and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offer rebates on state taxes, such as stamp duty and state GST.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide subsidies or rebates on interest costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reimburse employers’ contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have state agencies prioritize payments to MSME suppliers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide a “graduated system” of reporting — micro firms have the fewest document submissions, followed by small firms, medium firms, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a digital land bank with incentives for MSMEs to acquire or lease land.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remove less critical compliances for the first three years of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide subsidies or reimbursements for the acquisition of equipment related to required product testing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create district-level “facilitation cells” that help local MSMEs through their approval processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;infrastructure-support&quot;&gt;Infrastructure Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create “clusters” with common infrastructure, especially for related industries, with key features covered in an earlier report.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reimburse some percentage of the cost of electricity for business operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reimburse or subsidize land costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reimburse or subsidize land conversion fees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide subsidies or reimbursements for the cost of upgrading information and communications technology platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide subsidies or reimbursements for energy and water audits that can help the company save costs and increase productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide subsidies or reimbursements for the costs of equipment related to energy and water audits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;marketing-support&quot;&gt;Marketing Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide subsidies or reimbursements for renting a stall at a trade fair or exhibition. This can be for both domestic and international shows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tutor MSMEs on the central government MSME procurement mandate, helping them win orders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create programs to teach MSMEs how to get online.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subsidize the cost for MSMEs to list on SME exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a targeted plan with the National Skills Development Corporation (NSDC) to link states’ needs with central government training.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-ideas&quot;&gt;Other Ideas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Raw Materials: Many MSMEs highlight the lack of availability of raw materials. The state can look at information tools to help link MSMEs with available stocks of raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skilling: As with Haryana, the state can cover some of the costs MSMEs incur in training and skilling employees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

However, there still remain impediments that prevent this cooperative relationship from morphing into a wholehearted alliance.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;This report examines the writings of Chinese and Russian strategic thinkers to explore Sino-Russian cooperation across four main areas: arms sales and technology transfers, military exercises, space and cyber warfare, and hybrid tactics. The core sources used for this report have never before been translated into English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic thinkers in both countries recognize that while Russia currently faces increasing diplomatic isolation and economic stagnation, China’s global position and strength continues to grow. This widening gulf between the economic and technological capabilities of each country will increase the inequality in their relationship and in turn impact its bilateral dynamic. While Russia used to be the more advanced partner in terms of arms sales and technology transfers, China’s rapid development in these areas has put the two partners on more of an equal footing. China and Russia have increased their engagement in the realm of joint military exercises, and this collaboration is expected to continue. Regarding their work together on issues connected to space and cyber, engagement is more limited and is focused more on technical cooperation and joint diplomatic efforts to oppose perceived moves by the United States to militarize space. While China and Russia each recognize the importance of hybrid warfare in contemporary geopolitics, for now they lack a shared strategy of how best to counter Western hybrid capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, the fallout from Russia’s war in Ukraine threatens the long-term ability of the Kremlin to carry its weight in its partnership with Beijing. On the other hand, Russian efforts to react to Western-led economic sanctions and support for Ukraine could provide the Chinese leadership with an important guide as to how their own country could resist Western pressure during a crisis in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early February 2022, Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Xi Jinping of China met in person for the first time in two years for bilateral talks in advance of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. The summit concluded with a joint statement in which the leaders announced a partnership “with no forbidden areas of cooperation.” This was a pivotal moment in the Sino-Russian relationship. Coming amid heightened tensions between Moscow and the West triggered by Russia’s buildup of military forces along the Ukrainian border, the detailed statement demonstrated a joint commitment to building a stronger bilateral partnership. The meeting affirmed that not only do Putin and Xi both perceive the prevailing global order as Western-dominated and designed to constrain their ability to pursue their strategic interests, they also have a shared desire to challenge the existing global order. It demonstrated their mutual understanding that each country had something to gain from the other in the effort to move the world toward multipolarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which began only 20 days after the summit, immediately put to the test the proclamation that there were “no limits” to the Sino-Russian partnership. Yet, while Western officials may have hoped that the violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty would drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing, such expectations so far have proven overly optimistic. China has neither provided extensive military aid nor indicated a broad willingness to help Russia circumvent sanctions, but its leaders have refused to condemn Russia’s actions and instead blame the United States and the West for the war due to their enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance in disregard of Russia’s security concerns. Moreover, bilateral trade has intensified as Russia pivots away from European markets, and the countries continue to engage in joint military exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders of both Russia and China have also made confident statements regarding the robustness of their countries’ partnership. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi remarked in July that bilateral relations were characterized by their “strong resilience and strategic determination” amid uncertain geopolitical conditions, while his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov indicated that cooperation with China would not be subject to “external interference.” In short, the overall framework of the relationship as an anti-Western partnership remains intact, and the two countries continue to find opportunities for cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military sphere provides fertile ground for Russia and China to strengthen their relationship. Bilateral military ties have grown substantially since Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its proxy war in eastern Ukraine set it on a trajectory of confrontation with — and isolation from — the West. Cooperation has occurred along several vectors; for example, arms sales between the countries involve increasingly sensitive and complex technologies, the tempo and scope of military exercises has increased, and the two countries are collaborating on satellite navigation, which has substantial military applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Western analysts have closely examined Sino-Russian military cooperation in an effort to understand the factors that either perpetuate or limit the alignment of their strategic competitors. Yet, the perspectives of strategic thinkers from within Russia and China are often missing from the conversation, despite their obvious analytical value. To bridge this gap, CSIS has curated and translated strategically important primary-source materials from China and Russia to ascertain how strategic thinkers in each country expect bilateral military cooperation to develop in the coming years. These documents, which have been analyzed by leading defense and foreign policy specialists in the United States and Europe, contribute to a more complete understanding of China and Russia’s intentions, actions, and capabilities with regard to military cooperation. This knowledge is essential for defense officials and policymakers in Washington, Brussels, and other European capitals to develop realistic forecasts and create more effective plans to manage the implications of the alignment of these two geopolitical actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To obtain a wide-ranging view of how Russian and Chinese thinkers expect the bilateral military relationship to develop, CSIS has selected four areas of cooperation for close examination: arms sales and technology transfers, military exercises, space and cyber warfare, and hybrid tactics (such as influence operations). Translations of the Russian- and Chinese-language documents commenting upon cooperation in these areas are published on the website of the CSIS Interpret: China project, an online, interactive digital platform that uses previously untranslated primary source material to drive in-depth discussions and debates on strategic topics relating to U.S.-China relations and the broader topic of China’s rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;notable-findings&quot;&gt;Notable Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the four areas of cooperation, Russian and Chinese strategic thinkers recognize the importance of joint activities to advance the shared geopolitical goal of challenging Western hegemony in global affairs. The authors of the source documents cited in this project perceive that the “strategic triangle” their countries form with the United States is out of balance, and the significant advantage enjoyed by the United States and its allies in terms of force, technology, and the ability to set “the rules of the game” through international norms and legal frameworks is the main driver of global instability. Framing competition with the United States in zero-sum terms, the strategic communities in Russia and China suggest that eroding the West’s dominant position is necessary to create a more just and sustainable global order defined by the parity of major powers. In this context, bilateral cooperation is advantageous not only for its practical benefits (e.g., access to advanced technology, capacity development) but also for the signal that it sends to the West: each country is dissatisfied with the status quo and intends to change it. They apparently hope that the United States will eventually heed this message and demonstrate “respect” through self-deterrence (e.g., not responding to provocative messaging or actions by Russia or China in areas where they claim to have privileged interests, and thus gradually ceding their self-declared spheres of influence).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of the Russian and Chinese authors highlight the importance of using military cooperation to improve mutual trust and, by extension, strengthen the underpinnings of the Sino-Russian alignment. They also share an awareness of inequality within the relationship, with China continuing to develop its defense industrial capacity, advanced technological capabilities, and economic base to boost its major power status at a time when Russia is experiencing stagnation and seems headed for a prolonged period of decline. As China continues to develop, it will have less need for the expertise that Russia currently provides, but Russia will continue to require Chinese resources — especially if its diplomatic and economic isolation continues. To Russian and Chinese thinkers, the growing imbalance within the relationship does not necessarily mean cooperation will come to a halt; as long as Russian and Chinese leaders believe that the United States is trying to weaken or contain them as geopolitical competitors, there is something to be gained from further joint activities. Yet, the nature of the relationship is bound to change. Russia seems destined to play a supporting role to China should the “strategic triangle” transform into bipolar confrontation between China and the West — an outcome that some Russian authors struggle to accept. However, considering the key trends unique to each of the four aforementioned aspects of military cooperation, it would be premature to relegate Russia to “junior partner” status too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arms sales and technology transfers:&lt;/strong&gt; Both strategic communities recognize that the advancement of China’s defense industry has reduced the need to import military equipment from Russia, and accordingly, the commercial importance of arms sales has waned. As Chinese production capabilities catch up with Russia in certain areas and exceed it in others, what used to be a one-sided relationship is now on roughly equal footing. Although historical cases of Chinese reverse engineering and intellectual property theft — along with China’s potential to challenge Russia for primacy on the global arms market — have contributed to mistrust, each state desires greater access to technology to compete more effectively with the West. As such, strategic thinkers expect cooperation to continue and even deepen in the coming years as the two countries engage in the joint development of advanced systems (e.g., missile defense). The relatively equal standing of Russia and China in the field of arms sales and technology transfers — celebrated by Chinese thinkers in particular — may be fleeting, however, as both communities recognize that China is unlikely to share its most advanced technologies with Russia once it outpaces its former patron.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Military exercises:&lt;/strong&gt; The pace and complexity of joint exercises has increased steadily over the past decade, and both strategic communities expect Russia and China to maintain robust cooperation in this sphere. This is primarily driven by the need to send a message to the West about the growing military strength of their partnership. Strategic thinkers in both countries see military exercises as being particularly important for deterrence signaling in the Asia-Pacific region, where intensified strategic competition with Western powers appears inevitable. There is a shared recognition that military exercises are critical to trust building, as the two militaries become more familiar with the strengths, weaknesses, and capacities of the other’s equipment. Russian authors tend to be more sanguine about the practical military benefits of these exercises, claiming, for example, that they have resulted in the increased interoperability of forces but offering little evidence to back their claims. While their assessments may have shifted since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chinese writers recognize that they have much to learn from the Russian military, which has more recent experience conducting large-scale warfare, confronting adversaries trained by the West and equipped with Western arms, and competing with the United States in general.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space and cyber:&lt;/strong&gt; Open-source materials analyzing Russian and Chinese space cooperation tend to concentrate on two areas of activity: technical cooperation and diplomacy. The recent growth of China’s domestic space industry and healthy levels of funding for research suggest that Beijing is rapidly heading toward self-sufficiency when it comes to conducting space missions. Meanwhile, Russia’s status as a space-faring nation, recognized by Russian and Chinese authors as central to its sense of national pride, appears tenuous due to shrinking budgets, restrictions on imports, and aging equipment and personnel. The ambition of some technical cooperation programs, including plans to build a lunar research station together, appear out of sync with Russia’s ability to deliver, and it may only be a matter of time before Russia’s fears of being left behind in the space race are realized. Nonetheless, according to the authors of the source materials, there are still areas where Russia and China stand to benefit from cooperation, including diplomatic efforts to counter what they perceive as U.S. attempts to militarize space. (The potential for jointly developing counter-space capabilities is largely unexplored, despite comments by some authors that the West was triggering an arms race in space.) Chinese and Russian authors also appreciate the importance of developing alternatives to the West’s attempts to set rules in international fora on activities in space, seeing this as an imperative to retain sovereignty. They apply similar logic to cyberspace governance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; In stark contrast to Western perceptions, strategic thinkers in both countries believe that the concept of hybrid warfare originated in the United States as a means to undermine U.S. competitors. As such, experts from both China and Russia believe they must learn from the West and develop appropriate countermeasures to defend themselves against this threat. This defensive framing portends growing cooperation between Russia and China, but it is unclear whether the strategic communities of these countries have developed a shared language that would guide their response to the perceived maliciousness of the West. Chinese thinkers surveyed in this report distinguish between hybrid warfare, which attempts to create controlled chaos on the periphery of great powers as a means to balance their influence, and gray zone competition, which establishes narratives to justify the pursuit of certain aims. Understanding how to apply these distinct but complementary approaches is critical to the survival of rising powers in competition with the West. Russian scholars, meanwhile, emphasize the need to prepare the country for “mental war” — a form of total war in which states aim to destroy the foundation of each other’s strategic cultures. In this respect, protecting one’s information space becomes paramount; otherwise, states risk the erosion of the “core idea” underpinning their civilization. With regard to cooperation, strategic thinkers in Russia and China see regional organizations, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) grouping as a possible way to coordinate mutual activities to defend against Western hybrid aggression. They also focus on developing stronger information security measures and piloting new frameworks for cyberspace governance in hopes of mitigating the West’s perceived advantage in the information space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the source material for this report was gathered prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — a transformative and disruptive event that challenges many of the key assumptions laid out in the texts. In the following chapters, Western authors reviewing these source materials recognize the potential for the war to cause both positive and negative changes to the course to cooperation. Writing about military exercises, one expert noted that the Russian and Chinese strategic communities “made their predictions based on the implicit assumption that joint exercises would continue on their current trajectory” and cautioned that continuity is not a given. This warning could well apply to cooperation in other spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine poses contradictory implications for the course of Sino-Russian alignment. Russia’s poor performance on the battlefield — particularly in the early days of the invasion — has raised questions about the quality of Russian military technology and the Kremlin’s ability to pursue its strategic aims effectively. Due to wide-ranging Western sanctions, Russia is cut off from critical supply chains and funding sources, and it is ostracized in certain international fora. These factors could lead Beijing to reassess the nature of its ties with Russia. On the other hand, Russia’s experience in attempting to counter and overcome these impacts could prove valuable to Beijing as it girds itself for increased confrontation with the West in the Asia-Pacific region. In this case, the war in Ukraine could contribute to deeper cooperation between Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may sustain reputational damage from partnering with Moscow at a time when Russia has trampled upon international norms and principles, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in the affairs of foreign states. However, the overall contours of strategic competition with the West as part of a “strategic triangle” have not changed, and Beijing may find itself in a stronger position to set the terms of the relationship to a partner with few other friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, when relations with the West deteriorated significantly due to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its undeclared proxy war in eastern Ukraine, Russia accelerated its pivot to Asia. This pivot affected all areas of Sino-Russian bilateral cooperation, but it was particularly noticeable in the arms trade, where a softening of Russian export restrictions allowed for a revitalization of military-technological cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, only weeks before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, the Russian and Chinese presidents stated that their relationship had never been better and that it knew “no limits.” Despite this proclamation, members of the Russian security community are much more modest in their assessments of the partnership than their leaders, usually describing it as an “armed friendship” or a “partnership with limitations.” The dominant view among Russian military experts is that Sino-Russian military-technological cooperation is mainly military-political in character, motivated by the countries’ common opposition to what they perceive as the United States’ global hegemony. Mutual distrust and diverging local and regional interests make it seem less likely that China and Russia’s military-technological cooperation will turn into an alliance any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sino-russian-military-cooperation-past-and-present&quot;&gt;Sino-Russian Military Cooperation: Past and Present&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military experts consider arms trade the cornerstone of modern Sino-Russian security cooperation. When China was banned from importing Western military equipment after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Russia became the country’s main source for advanced equipment. During the 1990s, China imported approximately 30 percent of all Russian arms exports, illustrated in Figure 1. At the same time, the Russian defense budget deteriorated in the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse, and the Russian defense industry became dependent upon export earnings for survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in the mid-2000s, Chinese interest in Russian military technology fell as its own defense industrial capabilities rose. The rapid advancement of China’s domestic arms industry in recent years has narrowed bilateral cooperation on arms sales to the extent that China is now only interested in cooperating with Russia in the fields where Russia retains advantages and can offer world-leading technology. A countervailing influence on the relationship is that Russia has tended to refrain from exporting its most advanced military technology. For many years, security concerns led Russia to adopt a more restrictive export policy toward China than toward its other major military-technological partner, India. However, a shift in Russia’s policy was observed in 2015 when Russia agreed to sell China some of its most advanced military equipment, namely the Su-35 combat aircraft and S-400 air defense systems. Since 2015, China has purchased more newly developed equipment than any other importer of Russian arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military experts attribute the change in policy partly to the increased technological capabilities of the Chinese defense industry — which has made Beijing disinclined to purchase Russia’s second-best equipment — and partly to Russia’s weakened trade position following the fallout with the West. They assess that refusing to share technology with China will protect the Russian defense industry’s market position only in the short run. As Figure 2 shows, China has spent more than Russia on defense for more than 20 years. China is already ahead of Russia when it comes to fourth-generation technologies, electronics, composites, advanced materials, and shipbuilding. It is likely only a matter of time before China also catches up with Russia in the fields of air defense and aviation engine technologies. One Russian military expert considers it possible that the Chinese defense industry may start serial production of fifth-generation fighters before Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nyvFWZp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of the shift in policy, China’s share of Russian exported capabilities has increased, as illustrated in Figure 1. It should be noted, however, that the “amount of capabilities” does not reflect financial value, and the delivery years may be imprecise. This can be discerned by comparing capability exports with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s (SIPRI) financial value of arms transfers database, which shows that the value of Russian arms exports was stable in 2012–2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China has once again become an important market for Russian arms exports, the arms trade with China is no longer important to Russia for economic reasons, as the structure of Sino-Russian trade has changed over the last decades. Machinery and equipment, which made up a third of Russia’s exports to China in the 1990s, has fallen to the low single digits, while the share of hydrocarbons has significantly increased. Nevertheless, exports may still be important for companies within the Russian defense industry, if it allows them to maintain a wide spectrum of production lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prospects-for-future-cooperation&quot;&gt;Prospects for Future Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the view of the Russian strategic community, the revitalization of Sino-Russian arms trade and military-technological cooperation since 2014 is important mainly for geopolitical reasons. The driver of bilateral cooperation is perceived to be their common opposition to U.S. geopolitical interests and their similar vision of a future multipolar world. Since the relationship is based on mutualism, rather than ideology, future cooperation depends on the extent to which each of the parties can offer something that allows the other to achieve its objectives. The Chinese defense industry has not yet caught up with Russian producers of air defense systems, radar equipment, submarine technology, and aircraft engines. China is therefore likely to remain interested in cooperation with Russia in these fields. China has also shown interest in the new Russian Burak-M buoy for submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the view of the Russian strategic community, the revitalization of Sino-Russian arms trade and military-technological cooperation since 2014 is important mainly for geopolitical reasons. The driver of bilateral cooperation is perceived to be their common opposition to U.S. geopolitical interests and their similar vision of a future multipolar world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Russia is becoming increasingly interested in Chinese technology. Limitations on the import of Western components have led to delays in the development of many of the new generation Russian weapon systems, including the upgraded fourth-generation fighter MiG-35, the fifth-generation fighter Sukhoi Su-57, and the main battle tank T-14 Armata. In addition to establishing import substitution programs, Russia most likely will seek to replace some Western technological components with Chinese equivalents. The Russian strategic community sees prospects for further cooperation particularly in the field of automated control systems and robotics. Russia has also imported unpiloted aerial vehicles, Haval off-road vehicles, and naval diesel engines from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Russia and China have shown an interest in cooperating on the development of strategic armaments, including joint work on China’s new missile launch detection system. The system, which is based on Russian Tundra satellites and Voronezh ground-based radar stations, was reported to be close to completion in 2020. Since both Russian and Chinese strategic capabilities are intended mainly to deter the United States and its allies, the Russian strategic community sees cooperation in this field as financially and technologically beneficial, while posing minimal national security risks. As for now, Russian and Chinese missile defense capabilities are not integrated, but Vassily Kashin, a Russian expert on China’s military-industrial complex, believes integration is a possible next step. Integration would be mutually beneficial, he argues, since it gives both countries a longer warning time in the event of a ballistic missile launch by the United States. Other possible strategic cooperation projects include hypersonic technology and the construction of nuclear submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lack-of-trust-still-limits-technological-transfers&quot;&gt;Lack of Trust Still Limits Technological Transfers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite political assurances of a partnership that knows no limits, the Russian strategic community assesses that Sino-Russian military-technological cooperation continues to suffer from a lack of trust. Although the Russian strategic community has generally been open to the possibility of exporting military hardware to China, budding cooperation on arms sales has introduced significant security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, conservative members of the security community have raised fears that China would seek to expand into Russian territory or its areas of interest and that access to Russian weapons would help it achieve this goal. Although the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Russia’s Far East is currently considered far less likely than it was 15 years ago, new concerns have emerged in recent years about China’s interests in the Arctic and its military presence in Central Asia. Some Russian military experts also worry that China could exploit bilateral military-technological cooperation to contain Russia in the case of a future clash of interests in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, some experts and officials are concerned that China could outperform Russia in the global arms trade by exporting copied matériel at a lower cost to markets traditionally served by Russia. Within the Russian strategic community, China is perceived as highly competitive, using its economic advantage to gain access to Russia’s most advanced technology while protecting its own. In September 2020, editors of the industry’s leading newspaper, Military-Industrial Courier, warned that the arms trade with China was unlikely to result in Russia gaining new technological know-how, yet Russian arms producers would be pressured to give away their own expertise. They further cautioned that, by pursuing a policy of replacing Western components in its weapons with Chinese parts, Russia is merely transferring its dependency on one foreign power to another. In the editors’ view, Russia would be better served by developing its own defense industry than by seeking closer cooperation with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter assessments reflect the ambivalent attitude of Russian experts regarding the increased capability of the Chinese defense industry. On one hand, Russian experts are generally impressed with China’s achievements and frequently credit Russia for the quick modernization of the Chinese military. According to one assessment, it was due to Russian assistance that the Chinese military machine “made a leap forward by one or two generations of military equipment in most areas.” On the other hand, Russian experts claim that China’s modern fighter planes are the result of reverse engineering of Russia’s Su-27. The Sukhoi case and other perceived Chinese infringements of intellectual property rights have fostered a deep mistrust of China among members of the Russian strategic community and have led to predictions of new infringements in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-nato-operations-and-transatlantic-security&quot;&gt;Implications for NATO Operations and Transatlantic Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia’s rationale for enhancing military-technological cooperation with China in the 1990s and 2000s was the need for income, it has now evolved to include access to technology. Collaboration gives the two partners access to technology that they would not get independently. China’s imports of the S-400 air defense system and Su-35S fighter could give it an advantage in controlling the airspace above Taiwan. A technologically advanced People’s Liberation Army could pose military challenges for the United States in the Pacific region, forcing Washington to turn its focus more firmly toward Asia while leaving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) with the primary responsibility of protecting Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from 2015, bilateral cooperation was also expanded to include joint military exercises. In recent years, China has participated in Russia’s strategic exercises, and the countries have carried out joint naval maneuvers in the East and South China Seas, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Baltic Sea, as well as joint air patrols over the Sea of Japan. As a result, the two militaries have become more compatible and synchronized in weapon systems as well as in communications, tactics, and military doctrine. As pointed out above, the Russian strategic community nevertheless assesses that the military significance of Sino-Russian military cooperation should not be overestimated. Critical voices have argued that bilateral military ties are less deep and comprehensive than Sino-Pakistani cooperation, for instance, noting the limited scale of Sino-Russian joint exercises, the lack of joint programs for equipment repair, and the small number of joint technology development projects. While the possible integration of Russian and Chinese early warning systems could strengthen each country’s deterrence capabilities, Dmitri Trenin points out that the system itself poses a limited threat to transatlantic security and could actually improve global strategic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sino-Russian cooperation also limits the impact of Western sanctions on the Russian arms industry and ensures Russia’s access to technologies that it is no longer able to obtain from the West. For example, imports of Chinese electronic components and engines make it possible for Russia to complete designs that it lacks the inputs or ability to produce itself. Few, if any, nations other than China have sufficient economic leverage to deter Western economic statecraft, which means that Beijing is unlikely to abandon its arms trade with Russia in the near term. However, the disruptive potential of Western sanctions on Russia’s arms industry should not be underestimated. In 2017, the United States imposed the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which states that any country that has significant transactions with Iran, North Korea, or Russia could be sanctioned by the United States. This has hindered some countries’ willingness to trade arms with Russia. Since the law took effect, Egypt, Indonesia, and Algeria withdrew from plans to buy the Su-35S fighter jet. The tense political climate following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may further dampen the enthusiasm of potential buyers who are averse to testing the willingness of the United States to enforce secondary sanctions. In March 2022, for example, India canceled its orders of MiG-29 aircraft, helicopters, and anti-tank weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Russia, while a partnership with China might extend a lifeline to its defense industry, it is unlikely to revitalize it, as Russian strategic thinkers doubt that China would find it beneficial to share its most advanced technology with Russia. It also remains unclear whether the relationship is strong enough to overcome the dramatic measures imposed on Russia since its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. New sanctions imposed by the West are much more severe than the previous iterations, and large reductions of EU imports of Russian gas and oil will have consequences for Russian GDP and public income. Consequently, the Russian state and its defense industry may become even more dependent upon China for their future development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian strategic community assesses that China is a prudent partner, pursuing its own foreign policy interests that only partly coincide with Russia’s. The limits to their partnership are evident in terms of the two countries’ relations with Ukraine. Russian experts on China acknowledge that China has interests on both sides of the war. As one scholar summarizes: “China supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine, calls on the parties to conclude peace as soon as possible, does not plan to sever economic and political ties with neither Western countries nor Ukraine, but is also sharing Russia’s concerns about NATO expansion and will not join the sanctions against Moscow.” While some Russian experts assume that China will support the Russian economy in practice if not in words, others assess that China will try to use the situation to strengthen its economic presence in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian experts generally approve of Russia’s “pivot to China,” they admit that China is economically stronger and that Russia falls under a certain dependence. As long as China has stronger economic muscles and continues to close the gap in military technology, it will be much more likely for Russia to have to adapt to Chinese foreign policy goals than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sino-Russian relationship has grown increasingly close in recent years, though it still falls short of a formal alliance. In addition to military-political and military-operational cooperation, bilateral cooperation on military technology through arms sales and limited joint development projects has increased as China’s defense technological and industrial bases have modernized. The partnership, according to Chinese analysts, has moved from one in which China imported Russian weapons and platforms to one that is of greater equality between the two countries. While Chinese analysts point to like-minded geopolitical justifications for heightened cooperation in areas of military technology, they also acknowledge ongoing tensions and a lack of trust between the two countries that will prevent further deepening of the relationship. The bilateral military-technical cooperation between China and Russia should be of concern for the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO). China’s policy of military-civil fusion gives it access to industrial secrets and technological innovation from national economies within the NATO alliance through illicit means — such as industrial espionage — as well as through legal means, such as joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, foreign direct investment, and research and development (R&amp;amp;D) collaboration. This information could potentially be shared with Russia, with Russia also reciprocating. However, persistent political distrust between Russia and China could mean that each country will continue to reserve its most strategic capabilities, as well as information gained from sensitive espionage efforts, for national use only. Further research should be directed at whether this may change depending on how the Russian economy fares following the sanctions imposed on it as a result of its invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-of-the-deepening-sino-russian-political-and-military-relationship&quot;&gt;Context of the Deepening Sino-Russian Political and Military Relationship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deepening Sino-Russian ties in the area of arms sales and technology transfers fall within the wider context of an overall deepening bilateral relationship between the two countries. On February 4, 2022, Russia and China publicized a joint statement on their common positions with regards to the world order and their “limitless” bilateral strategic partnership. The statement seems to have marked the formalization of a new phase in their relationship, though many of the points covered in the document were already present in their existing bilateral relationship. Even following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi stated that “China is willing to work with Russia to take China-Russian ties to a higher level in a new era.” According to some Chinese academics, the bilateral relationship has turned a corner; whereas China was once heavily dependent on the Soviet Union, it has gradually developed a partnership of relative equals with the Russian Federation, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The relationship has moved from a period in which the two sides recognized each other as friendly countries in the early 1990s to a comprehensive strategic partnership in the second decade of the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese views of the Sino-Russian partnership are often also framed within the larger context of common strategic interests and competition with the United States. Hou Aijun from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, for example, states that since the 1990s, both China and Russia have acted as stabilizing forces and geopolitical balancing factors in a world order that is unjust and excludes the Global South, and which is “constantly eroded and destroyed” by a revisionist United States seeking to stave off its inevitable decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the strong sentiment of deep partnership between Russia and China, such as that expressed by Hou, Chinese academics acknowledge that the bilateral relationship is not truly “limitless.” Hou, for example, explains that areas of mistrust include border security, differences in each other’s political systems, historical grievances, and China’s economic expansion into Central Asia. Some thinkers, like Zhang Deguang, former secretary general of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, have highlighted areas of concern about Russia’s future trajectory in international relations, although Zhang was generally optimistic despite Russia’s shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science and technology diplomacy has been a significant part of the bilateral relationship since before the fall of the Soviet Union, and against the backdrop of U.S.-China technological competition, it serves China’s geopolitical goal of becoming a global technological leader. According to Luo Hui, former director of the Innovation Strategy Research Institute of the China Association for Science and Technology, science and technology diplomacy helps advance China’s overall innovation strategy while also fulfilling larger diplomatic goals. However, Chinese thinkers ascribe Russia’s pursuit of technological cooperation to public diplomacy efforts to “increase mutual understanding between people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-views-of-deepening-military-technological-relationship&quot;&gt;Chinese Views of Deepening Military-Technological Relationship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military-technological cooperation between China and Russia also dates back to the Soviet era, starting in the 1950s with secondments of Soviet experts to job placements in China and the signing of cooperation agreements on issues such as nuclear energy and weapons technologies. Although China today no longer relies on Russia as its primary source of military weapons and platforms procurement following China’s advancement in science and technology and the modernization of its own defense technological and industrial base, Chinese academics still point to Russia’s “profound accumulation of basic scientific research” in areas such as materials science, mathematics, physics, aerospace, power efficiency, polar exploration, space science, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Li Shuyin, director and researcher with the European Military Research Office of the Department of Foreign Military Studies at the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, Chinese and Russian military-technological cooperation forms part of their “three-in-one” relationship, which also encompasses military-political and military-operational aspects. The military-political relationship is based on regular meetings between heads of state, as well as mechanisms for regular meetings at the defense ministerial level and general staff strategic consultations. The military-operational relationship is founded on regular joint exercises, such as the “Peace Mission” series, which seek to build cooperation and mutual trust between each country’s armed forces. Lastly, arms sales, technology transfers, and (to a lesser extent) R&amp;amp;D collaboration form the “core of China-Russia military cooperation.” This aspect of the relationship has significant historical roots that have shaped modern bilateral ties. China was an important destination for Russian weapons in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as during the Western arms embargo that followed China’s crackdown on protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Despite the rapid modernization of China’s defense industry, in 2021, the country remained Russia’s second-largest destination for arms exports, following India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military-technological relationship is governed by the Intergovernmental Commission on Military-Technological Cooperation, which meets yearly and focuses on the procurement of various technologies from each country. In 2015, it was reported the Chinese side was focused on purchases of modern warplanes, ships, and new land equipment, while the Russian side was focused on air and missile defense systems. Chinese arms transfers from Russia also include, in some instances, production licenses, as was considered for the Su aircraft series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These imports have served the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in multiple ways. They are politically symbolic of support in Moscow and Beijing for the deepening bilateral relationship, while also providing opportunities for China’s defense industry to learn about specific aspects of Russian technology to integrate into its own capabilities, such as thrust vector control in Russian aircraft engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical benefit to the PLA from these types of imports should not be underestimated, nor should arms imports be conflated with trust within the relationship, for reasons outlined further below. Similar to the science and technology partnership, Chinese academics characterize the bilateral military-technological relationship as serving national interests and, ultimately, the country’s strategic goals. As Li Shuyin states: “From China’s point of view, learning from others and introducing and drawing on relatively mature foreign military-technological achievements can, in a relatively short amount of time, raise China’s level of defense modernization, especially in naval and air force weapons modernization, effectively curb hegemonism and power politics, reduce the security pressures it faces, and prevent the infiltration of international terrorist forces.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Li Shuyin argues that arms sales have been an important source of funding and foreign currency for the Russian military-industrial complex. Accordingly, as both sides perceive that they are benefiting from their partnership in the field of military-technological cooperation, analysts expect this relationship to continue into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of this cooperation, however, is transforming from one-sided procurement to equal learning. Just as the general science and technological cooperative relationship has moved on from being characterized primarily by China acquiring knowledge from the Soviet Union (and then Russia), so too has the military-technological relationship. Li Shuyin points to the links between Chinese national sentiment and the historical relationship between China and the Soviet Union, stating that the “Soviet Union’s deep-rooted chauvinism led it to regard itself as the major party and the major power,” which allowed it to determine the nature and amount of military cooperation with China at any time. China’s economic and technological rise has allowed it to assert its equality within the relationship more confidently and to push back against this perceived Russian chauvinism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the relationship has also evolved as the innovative potential of each defense industrial complex has strengthened. Authors like Li Dapeng, from the Naval Engineering University, already argued in 2015 that “the context of Sino-Russian military-technological cooperation should shift from focusing on procurement of weapons systems, equipment and components to focusing on cooperative R&amp;amp;D and joint manufacturing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Chinese analysts also point to obstacles in the deepening of defense technological cooperation between Russia and China. Li Dapeng indirectly references concerns in Russia about Chinese reverse engineering of Russian weapons, stating that “some Chinese-made weapons have similarities with Russian-made weapons in technical genes.” In one relevant case, Moscow suspended the production of the second batch of J-11A/SU-27SK fighters following Beijing’s alleged violation of the coproduction agreement with Russia. Given that Russia is a major player in the global arms trade, China’s relative advantage in terms of manufacturing capacity and production costs could pose problems for Moscow if Beijing ramps up production of its variants of Russia-derived weapons for export. As Li Dapeng notes, Russia’s concern about losing market share as Chinese exports become more cost-effective is a “major obstacle to deepening and expanding Sino-Russian military-technological cooperation.” The modernization of China’s defense industrial base and economic power has afforded Beijing the capacity to manufacture weapons and platforms for export or transfer at subsidized prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, arms sales volumes are likely to decline in the future, as China’s defense industry becomes more capable, efficient, and competitive. China and Russia may continue to cooperate instead on the joint development of emerging and disruptive technologies, or on a missile early warning system — technologies that fit into China’s military modernization goals of catching up and overtaking the United States militarily. However, as a result of the war in Ukraine, Chinese military-technological cooperation with Russia becomes more complicated, as it puts Beijing at risk of being targeted with secondary sanctions. Furthermore, Russia’s tech industry is experiencing brain drain as a result of the invasion, which may complicate the two countries’ cooperation in the field of emerging and disruptive technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Sino-Russian military cooperation is based on mutual self-interest, which includes tilting regional and global balances of strategic power in favor of Moscow and Beijing. While geopolitics will play a major role in the propelling this relationship forward, they also generate certain disruptions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its actions in the early months of the war are exemplary of the potential drawbacks of a “relationship with no limits,” as Beijing has been forced to carefully craft a balanced position to not criticize Russia while also upholding its self-declared principles of non-interference and respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the greater political-military relationship, Sino-Russian cooperation is guided primarily by mutual trust, which according to Li Shuyin remains insufficient. Li Shuyin notes that geopolitics contributes to the lack of trust between the two countries, as “some people in China . . . voice dissatisfaction with the obvious disparity in the sale of weapons and equipment to China and India, maintaining that this runs counter to the China-Russia strategic partnership of coordination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-nato-and-transatlantic-security&quot;&gt;Implications for NATO and Transatlantic Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of cooperation between China and Russia in defense technological terms from a supplier-client state relationship to one of greater technological and scientific equality means that NATO faces a potentially stronger bloc. China and Russia have already moved to cooperate on R&amp;amp;D in areas of emerging technology with defense applications, such as artificial intelligence. The overall alignment of each side’s interests for geopolitical and financial reasons signals that there is little prospect to drive a wedge between Beijing and Moscow in their effort to deepen defense technological engagement. NATO thus potentially faces an adversary and systemic competitor who can combine significant resources in areas of technological R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The evolution of cooperation between China and Russia in defense technological terms from a supplier-client state relationship to one of greater technological and scientific equality means that NATO faces a potentially stronger bloc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implication of this changing relationship is also cause for concern regarding NATO’s own defense innovation strengths in the future. China’s efforts to integrate foreign innovation into its defense technological and industrial base go beyond the Sino-Russian relationship. Indeed, existing research has shown that Chinese military institutions continue to engage with foreign academic and research institutions to develop sensitive technologies with military applications and to improve the skills of Chinese military researchers in relevant techniques and processes. If Russia and China’s military-technological cooperation deepens in the area of R&amp;amp;D, then NATO ally-originating innovation could also transfer via China to Russia’s military industrial complex, thereby enhancing Russian defense capabilities and weakening the alliance’s technological edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as Chinese analysts have also pointed out, military-technological cooperation within the bilateral Sino-Russian relationship is not without its obstacles. Lack of mutual trust still plagues the relationship; from a Chinese perspective, it prevents further deepening of the existing relationship. It is therefore unclear whether the reported collaboration on R&amp;amp;D for weapons and capabilities will continue to provide significant strategic value to either military in the long term. Lastly, the question of how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will impact Sino-Russian defense technological cooperation remains inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian-Chinese joint military exercises have expanded dramatically since the two countries held their first Peace Mission exercise in 2004, and they are of growing concern in the Western analytical community. This article reviews four recent papers written by Russian military experts which offer fresh insights on these joint exercises from the Russian perspective. The experts agree that Russia-China joint exercises are expanding in scope, scale, and intensity, and they provide new details on just how they are expanding. They highlight recent trends such as the increase in holding larger strategic exercises on each other’s territory, the addition of joint air patrols, and the likelihood of future joint air and naval deployments. They also discuss Russia’s growing interest in using joint exercises to assess Chinese innovations, and (less persuasively) the growing emphasis on interoperability in joint exercises. In the process, the authors offer additional particulars on the expanding scope of joint exercises to include inter alia mountain and winter warfare and combined air-ground assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors also highlight the importance of messaging in joint exercises, which are often designed expressly to demonstrate the two countries’ growing military power and the strength of their strategic partnership. In doing so, the authors seem intent on reinforcing the messaging effect by overstating the psychological impact of joint exercises on the West, thus departing to some extent from objective analysis. The authors also highlight that joint exercises are contributing to a growing military convergence. While they agree that the two countries are not currently in an alliance, they emphasize that military relations have expanded and now exceed the bounds of a “normal” relationship. Collectively, the authors’ views are fairly representative of the Russian security community, although they also offer insights of their own on joint exercises. While the papers are not wholly objective — overstating the importance of interoperability, for example, as well as the potential for joint operations against the West — they offer valuable details on the nature and objectives of joint exercises and on the views (and hopes) of the Russian analytical community regarding their future direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian strategic community has commented extensively on the continuing expansion of Russia-China joint military exercises, which have increased markedly in terms of their scope, scale, and frequency and through the addition of new exercise series. Russian experts tend to view these trends as further evidence of a growing military convergence between the two countries. The Russian authors covered in this paper are no exception, although they each highlight different dimensions to illustrate this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Vinokurov, professor at the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and vice president of the League of Military Diplomats, reports that Russia and China held two major joint exercises in just a three-month span in 2019: the first in July followed by the Tsentr strategic exercises in September. He notes that these were viewed as regular, routine events, indicating that joint exercises are growing in both scale and frequency. This is further evidence of what he sees as a general strengthening of connections in the military sphere. Alexander Yermakov, an independent military analyst and member of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), likewise highlights the growing frequency of joint exercises, pointing to the recent Zapad/Interaction-2021 strategic multi-country exercises held in August 2021 followed just one month later by Peace Mission counterterrorism exercises held in September. Coming in such close proximity, these exercises reflect a deepening of cooperation between the two sides in the sphere of defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yermakov notes that joint exercises are increasing not only in frequency but in scale: for instance, Zapad/Interaction-2021 involved 13,000 People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops, 200 armored vehicles, 90 artillery pieces, a Russian motorized rifle unit, and more than 100 planes and helicopters. A recent RIA Novosti article on Russia-China military relations adds that joint exercises are now held at sea, on land, and in the air, having expanded to encompass all of the principal military domains. More ominously, this article also notes that recent joint exercises are placing greater emphasis on joint repulsion of enemy attacks, citing the West as the likely target of these efforts. The article then quotes Vasiliy Kashin, director of the Centre for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, who argues that joint exercises are becoming more advanced and more high-tech as well. As further evidence, the article points to the recent flurry of joint exercises such as the Vostok-2018 and Tsentr-2019 strategic exercises held in Russia and the Joint Sea naval exercises held in the Baltic and South China Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinokurov and Ruslan Polonchuk, a military expert at the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA), both highlight the recent joint air patrols conducted over disputed waters in the East China Sea. They contend that joint air patrols represent an expansion of Russian-Chinese joint exercises to include joint deployments. By joint deployments, they are likely referring to a range of potential activities that the two sides could undertake, including combined air and naval patrols, port visits, search and rescue operations, and other joint peacetime activities. Vinokurov indicates that these are likely to become a routine part of the Russia-China joint exercise program, since they demonstrate the two countries’ readiness for further collaboration in this area. Going forward, Polonchuk believes that joint activities will expand even further to include joint naval “show-the-flag” deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polonchuk also highlights the recent expansion of Russia-China joint naval exercises to include new participants — most notably Iran — as another important development. He argues that joint naval maneuvers with Iran demonstrated a growing coordination on joint maritime activities between the three countries with a distinctly anti-American character, coming as they did amid escalating tensions between the United States and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group of experts cited above indicate that joint exercises are becoming more important for both China and Russia. Polonchuk notes, for example, that joint exercises have increased in importance over the last several years, while arms sales between the two sides have declined, indicating that joint exercises may eventually become the main line of effort in Russia-China military affairs. The PLA’s willingness to continue joint exercises with Russia despite Covid-19 risks was cited separately as evidence of their growing importance to China. Yeramakov marks the recent trend to appoint high-ranking military commanders to lead joint exercises as further evidence of their increasing importance. As an example, he cites the appointment of Li Zuochen, a member of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) Central Military Commission, to command Chinese forces during Zapad/Interaction-2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors all agree that the recent expansion of Russia-China joint exercises is contributing to a growing strategic partnership between the two countries, a trend that is likely to continue. The RIA Novosti article views this as part of a larger trend toward increased defense cooperation, which has now reached a “level unprecedented over the past half-century.” It further claims that joint exercises are so ingrained that they have now become a “tradition” — a novel though not unreasonable way of characterizing joint exercises, given their growing scope, scale, and frequency. In any event, all of these factors imply that joint exercises are likely to continue on their current trajectory, with important implications for the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors are correct that joint exercises are expanding as the two countries have continued to add new series of exercises. They are also correct in highlighting that joint exercises are increasing in scope, scale, and frequency. The authors go further, offering valuable insights on just how joint exercises are expanding, all of which warrants further attention. For example, Polonchuk could well be correct in projecting an increase in joint deployments, which offer yet another way for the two sides to engage in joint military activities at low cost and to achieve political and military effects, with important implications for Asia-Pacific and transatlantic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors are also quite correct that joint exercises are a critical component of the Russia-China strategic partnership, complementing arms sales, key leader engagements, and defense research and development as the main forms of military cooperation. As joint exercises have developed, each country has become the other’s most important joint exercise partner. Joint exercises in turn reflect a growing convergence at the strategic level, with Moscow and Beijing now aligned on the most important issues facing them in the international arena. This includes a shared desire to limit U.S. power and to usher in a multipolar world order. In the military sphere, this convergence is reflected in their joint opposition to U.S. missile defense, prompt global strike, and the militarization of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed in this light, joint military exercises are part of a larger combined effort by Russia and China to improve their respective military capabilities and expand their influence, while simultaneously signaling their displeasure with U.S. and Western policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-objectives-of-joint-exercises&quot;&gt;Military Objectives of Joint Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of these four papers also emphasize that military exercises are an effective means to build experience and to promote knowledge transfer. As an example, Vinokurov discusses the recent Tsentr 2019 exercises held in central Russia, where Russian and Chinese bombers practiced joint interdiction of opposing ground forces, exposing the two sides to their respective methods of attack. The RIA Novosti article highlights the use of joint exercises to develop certain specialized capabilities. As examples, it discusses two recent joint exercises in which Russian and Chinese forces practiced winter and alpine combat operations. It then quotes Kashin, who notes that joint exercises are becoming more advanced and more high-tech, while focusing increasingly on operations of the kind needed to confront an advanced foreign adversary, which he says could only be the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polonchuk agrees, even though he asserts that China is benefiting militarily more than Russia from such exercises, a view shared by most Western analysts. He notes, for example, that the Joint Sea naval exercises have been especially important for the PLA Navy, since they are designed to focus more on tasks facing the PRC, while exposing the PLA Navy to the methods used by the more experienced Russian navy. Polonchuk likewise points out that China is using Peace Mission exercises to prepare the PLA for counterterrorist actions in Central Asia, which he notes could be used against the PRC’s indigenous Uighur population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Polonchuk argues that this trend is changing, and that combined military exercises are becoming more balanced, or more “multi-vectored” as he puts it. Whereas before, they were used mainly as a means for the PLA to learn from the more experienced Russian military, joint exercises are increasingly benefiting both sides. He notes, for example, that Russian ground forces gained important insights from their exposure to Chinese motorized rifle units during recent joint exercises. Based on this, he advocates for the two to hold additional joint exercises involving motorized rifle units so they can hone their skills in urban combat. He also suggests that Russian forces hold additional joint exercises on Chinese ranges as they did during Zapad/Interaction-2021, both to gain more exposure to the PLA’s new theater command system and to weigh its pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yermakov concurs, claiming that Zapad/Interaction-2021, held in China, “showed a definitively new stage in the cooperative military preparations of both nations,” with Russian units exercising for the first time using Chinese systems — especially the PLA’s new wheeled armored vehicle, a system for which there is no current analog in the Russian military. Yermakov notes that “the careful study and use of Chinese technology in maneuvers made up the innovative aspect of this drill.” Moreover, he notes that the study of Chinese experimental weapons by the army was extremely useful and should therefore be continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two papers commented on the growing emphasis on interoperability in recent joint military exercises, a subject that has attracted a good deal of Western attention as well. Kashin contends, for example, that joint exercises are focused increasingly on interoperability, which enhances the potential for joint operations against a major foreign adversary. He provides little support for this claim, however. Yermakov likewise highlights the new levels of military integration achieved during Zapad/Interaction-2021, which he cites as the main innovation of these exercises. Specifically, he notes that the two sides established a joint headquarters, with a unified command and control system to guide operations, which enabled them to carry out coordinated air strikes and joint helicopter-borne assaults. However, Yermakov seems to carry his argument a bit too far by implying that, as a result, Russian-Chinese joint exercises now exhibit a demonstrable level of mutual cooperation comparable to that of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), although he cites a Chinese source to convey this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military experts tend to give greater weight to the military benefits of joint PRC exercises than do many Western analysts, who are more prone to believe that such exercises are carried out primarily for their messaging effects, with less emphasis on their military benefits. Western analysts have pointed out, for example, that Russia-China joint exercises have in some cases been carefully scripted, and at times conducted in parallel in what were essentially separate side-by-side exercises. They also tend to believe that the Chinese military benefits more from joint exercises than its Russian counterpart, by allowing the PLA to learn from the more experienced Russian armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western analysts also tend to be more skeptical of claims of increased interoperability in Russia-China joint exercises, finding it hard to take them seriously in light of the extremely low likelihood that the two countries would actually engage in joint operations. Such views are reinforced by exaggerated claims such as the one cited by Yermakov, as there is virtually no evidence that Russia and China have anything close to the kind of joint command and control systems and interoperability standards employed by NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-and-messaging-effects-of-joint-exercises&quot;&gt;Political and Messaging Effects of Joint Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent with the views of the Russian security community, the authors of the four articles under discussion also recognize that Russia-China joint exercises have an important messaging component, one that benefits both countries by demonstrating the growing military strength of their strategic partnership, even though such messages are not always directed toward the West. The authors stress that achieving strategic and political effects remains an important driver for joint exercises. Polonchuk, for example, notes that the PLA uses joint exercises to demonstrate its growing ability to combat both traditional and nontraditional threats. He also indicates that Peace Mission exercises have had a stabilizing effect on the situation in Central Asia by reassuring the countries in the region of Russian and Chinese support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors all tend to agree, however, that one of the primary purposes of joint exercises is to send a message to the West about the growing strength of Russian-Chinese military relations. Polonchuk argues, for example, that holding joint naval drills in locations outside of one or both sides’ traditional operating areas — such as the Baltic Sea, in the case of China — displays the growing military power of the two countries for Western audiences. Likewise, Vinokurov notes that the recent joint air patrols over the East China Sea “elicited an unpleasant reaction from U.S. allies” by demonstrating the growing military collaboration between Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polonchuk concurs, citing joint air patrols as an important tool for achieving long-term political goals in the Asia-Pacific region, although he does not specify what these goals are. The RIA Novosti articles goes even further, arguing that joint exercises are used to convey to potential adversaries the two countries’ growing ability to counter common enemies. Going forward, Polonchuk believes that Moscow and Beijing will continue to pursue one-time events (i.e., joint exercises and deployments) that have strong signaling effects but carry a low probability of causing unwanted escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it should be noted that the authors often use their own papers as vehicles to reinforce the messaging effects of joint military exercises. To avoid attribution, however, they often use the rhetorical device of citing Western or Chinese sources when discussing the growing threat from Russia-China military relations. Thus, while these papers contain much useful information, they should not be considered wholly objective in their characterization of Sino-Russian joint exercises, which are used to some extent to amplify the signaling effects of the actual joint exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, Vinokurov cites a recent New York Times article to claim indirectly that the “the West . . . is particularly disturbed by the military-technical cooperation (MTC) of Russia and China.” He takes pains to show that the West has good reason to be concerned by discussing the many recent measures taken by Russian and China to strengthen cooperation in the security sphere, including new joint agreements, summit meetings, and of course joint exercises. He concludes by citing U.S. Fleet Admiral Philip S. Davidson — then commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet — who said that Russia continues to be an existential threat to the United States and that by the middle of the next decade the United States could lose its leading edge to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that the Russian security community tends to play up the implications of Russia-China joint exercises beyond their actual effects. Russian analysts often suggest by various means that Moscow and Beijing will increase their counterbalancing efforts toward the West should relations between Russia, China, and the West deteriorate further. They also imply that at some point joint exercises could expand to include serious preparations for joint military operations against the West. In the view of most Western analysts, however, such claims tend to lack credibility given the two countries’ demonstrated unwillingness to become entangled in each other’s principal security disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-of-joint-exercises-for-russia-china-relations&quot;&gt;Implications of Joint Exercises for Russia-China Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian security community tends to agree that joint exercises are contributing to a growing military convergence between Russia and China, which is driven primarily by their increasing confrontation with the West. The authors of these articles likewise acknowledge that joint exercises are contributing to a growing strategic partnership between Russia and China, though none of the authors believe that an outright military alliance is imminent. The four authors differ, however, regarding the degree to which current military relations are already approaching an alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polonchuk concedes that Russian-Chinese military relations cannot be considered a military alliance either in theory or in practice, mainly because an alliance would be counterproductive. Today, for example, the Kremlin is in a position to mediate tensions between China and India, but this would no longer be possible if Russia and China were in a true alliance. Yet, he implies that recent joint naval exercises between Russia, China, and Iran should be considered a show of solidarity amid escalating tensions between the United States and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yermakov asserts that the two countries are far from being involved in a true military alliance, and are not working toward one either, although he offers no explanation for why this is the case. At the same time, he notes correctly that the frequent and complex military drills held by both countries should put to rest recurring claims in the West that conflict between Russia and China is inevitable due to persistent mistrust. Kashin points out that joint exercises have helped to build trust between the two sides, noting for example that Russian and Chinese soldiers and officers have grown well acquainted with each other through recent joint exercises. He adds that this growing awareness of each other’s military capabilities “allows them to feel confident, separate myths from reality, [and] understand what capabilities they are actually developing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinokurov appears more optimistic about the possibility of alliance. He notes that China and Russia have developed their connections to the level of mutual partnership and strategic cooperation, and that joint military activities now “exceed the bounds of normal military cooperation.”37 This he attributes to the two countries’ deteriorating relations with the United States. He argues, however, that talk of an alliance is premature, mainly because China is not yet ready for one — perhaps implying indirectly that Russia is more open to an alliance, although he falls short of stating this outright. Interestingly, he claims that President Xi himself recently ruled out an alliance with Russia during a speech before the PRC Central Committee. At the same time, Vinokurov claims that the national security of Moscow and Beijing are now understood as a common interest. As a consequence, they can be expected to “react effectively to [counter] new or well-established threats.” Thus, faced with the growing threat from the United States, at some point further military rapprochement if not an outright alliance would become inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RIA Novosti article carries this argument the furthest, implying that the two already have an alliance of sorts. According to this article, “although the countries do not intend in principle to enter into a formal military alliance, it is sometimes referred to as an ‘undeclared’ one.” While conceding that joint exercises are not directed against third countries, at the same time, it discusses Russia and China’s “growing ability to rebuff a common threat,” while contending that the recent increase in joint strategic exercises is intended to work out “the [repulsion] of potential aggression.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors’ views on the potential for an outright military alliance are characteristic of Russian discourse in this area, but they should be taken with a grain of salt. While the Russian security community rightly believes that strategic relations between Russia and China are growing and that countering U.S. interests remains an important driver, it mostly recognizes that the two sides are unlikely to forge an actual alliance anytime soon absent further deterioration of their relations with the West. Thus, talk of an impending or outright military alliance with real mutual defense commitments should be considered mainly as a messaging exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth adding that these diverging views on the contribution of joint exercises to a growing military partnership between Russia and China are quite typical for both the Russian and Western analytical communities. They reflect ongoing debates within both communities about how best to characterize Russia-China relations and where they are ultimately heading. Despite the increasing levels of defense cooperation between the two countries, military relations still fall well short of an outright alliance. For example, Moscow and Beijing have not agreed to collective defense commitments, and there is little prospect that they will do so. There is likewise little prospect that the two would conduct joint military operations anytime soon, with the possible exception of Central Asia where they could conceivably act jointly to combat an armed terrorist threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While the Russian security community rightly believes that strategic relations between Russia and China are growing and that countering U.S. interests remains an important driver, it mostly recognizes that the two sides are unlikely to forge an actual alliance anytime soon absent further deterioration of their relations with the West.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, neither country has any desire to become embroiled in key disputes involving the other. Russia has no interest, for example, of becoming embroiled in a future conflict with the United States over Taiwan. China likewise has no desire of being drawn into an armed conflict with the West, for instance over Ukraine. Nor do the two countries rely on each other for extended deterrence, since both are quite capable of deterring attacks on their homelands. Based on this, the likelihood of an alliance remains low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, as Vinokurov points out, military relations between Russia and China have grown beyond the “bounds of normal military cooperation,” indicating quite correctly that the two countries have grown much closer both strategically and militarily than is typical of a purely transactional relationship. Instead, military cooperation has broadened and deepened, and has become increasingly become institutionalized as both sides have continued to benefit from joint activities. Military relations are complementary, helping to strengthen the armed forces and defense industries of both countries if often in different ways. This continuing ambiguity has made it difficult for analysts in both Russia and the West to characterize Russia-China military relations and to say definitively where they are heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four articles reviewed in this paper, which are fairly representative of the Russian security community, offer fresh perspectives on Russia-China joint military exercises, even though much of what they say is already familiar to Western scholars. Most Western analysts would agree with the authors that joint exercises between the two countries are expanding. However, their papers offer deeper insights on just how they are expanding and what that portends for the future. Based on their findings, for example, they have argued persuasively that we should expect to see more joint deployments, including joint naval deployments and deployments in the transatlantic region, to highlight the growing reach of Russian and Chinese military power. They have also argued quite plausibly that we can expect joint exercises to become more balanced and more strategic in their focus, including an increase in joint exercises held on Russian and Chinese territory. They also argue quite reasonably that we can expect to see more exercises involving third parties, such as Iran. The recent joint naval exercises involving Russia, China, and South Africa are a good case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors’ predictions about the future direction of Russia-China joint exercises also seem quite sound, at least based on the conditions in effect when these papers were first written. At the time, joint exercises appeared poised to continue at high levels and to expand even further, and the authors have made good arguments on just how they would do so. The authors have also focused quite appropriately on the importance of messaging in joint exercises to achieve political effects, which will continue to drive and shape joint exercises. Discussions of the military benefits of joint exercises are also quite useful in highlighting aspects of joint exercises that have received less attention in the West, such as the incorporation of aerial interdiction and winter warfare. The authors have also argued persuasively that exercises are becoming more strategic while taking on greater importance for both sides, even though they have tended to overstate the importance of interoperability and the likelihood of joint operations against the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the authors made their predictions based on the implicit assumption that joint exercises would continue on their current trajectory. This is no longer a given, however, since the four articles discussed here were all written prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. The events in Ukraine have a high likelihood of altering the course of Russia-China joint military exercises, if not necessarily in ways that one might expect. In the short run, Russia is likely to remain too distracted by the Ukraine conflict to sustain joint exercises with China at pre-conflict levels. In addition, the continuing drain on Russian resources, including loss of equipment and personnel, will make it more difficult for Moscow to free up forces to participate in military drills with China, although this will likely impact large-scale joint ground force exercises more than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite such limitations, given their military and political importance joint exercises are almost certain to continue, although they are likely to be channeled into areas less affected by the Ukraine conflict — such as counterterrorism, joint naval exercises, and table-top exercises. Based on the PRC’s continuing focus on its maritime territorial disputes and its reluctance to become embroiled in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, we could very well see an increase in joint naval exercises and joint air patrols in the Western Pacific. In this regard, the recent joint air patrols held by the two sides in May 2022 over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea are a good indication of the direction future cooperation may take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long run, the impact on joint exercises is more uncertain. It would be easy to conclude that China would have less interest in exercising with a Russian military that has failed to perform that effectively in Ukraine. While this is possible, countervailing factors make this outcome less likely. First, for all its faults, the Russian military has acquired a great deal of hard-earned combat experience in Ukraine, especially in high-end combat operations. Even though Russian forces have suffered a number of major reverses, they have also had notable successes in Ukraine, especially in the south and increasingly in the Donbas region as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Russia’s combat experience in Ukraine especially valuable is the fact that it has been acquired against an adversary that has received extensive training and equipment from the United States and its allies. When added to its recent military experience in Syria, the low-scale war it waged in Ukraine from 2014 until February 2022, and its 2008 campaign in Georgia, Russia will have much to offer China regarding the latest U.S./NATO weapons and tactics. These lessons would be especially valuable for the PRC, a country that has not engaged in serious armed conflict since its 1979 campaign in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are few countries outside of Russia that could serve as an effective partner for China for conducting complex joint military exercises. No other country willing to exercise with China has anywhere near the kinds of military capabilities and experience held by the Russia military. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the very military challenges that Russia has encountered in Ukraine — so clearly linked to the vigorous Western military backing received by Ukraine — represent a common security challenge for both Russia and China. Developing realistic military solutions to counter future direct or proxy confrontations with the West as informed by the Ukraine conflict will provide a strong incentive for Russia and China to maintain or even expand their current level of defense cooperation, with joint exercises likely to play an important role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-1&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent years have witnessed a considerable strengthening of relations between China and Russia. Chinese president Xi Jinping’s decision to meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin and issue a historic joint statement in February 2022 — just weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine — was widely seen as a signal that China is doubling down on the China-Russia relationship. Beijing’s subsequent refusal to criticize Russia’s invasion further solidified this view in the United States and its allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military cooperation through joint exercises has been an important driver behind the strengthening of the China-Russia bilateral relationship. Unlike Russian arms sales to China, which have waxed and waned in importance over the years, China-Russia joint military exercises have remained a robust area of military cooperation. Between 2003 and 2021, the two countries participated in over 60 military exercises, including both bilateral and multilateral exercises. The overwhelming majority of these were held since 2013. Early signs indicate that Beijing and Moscow are continuing to prioritize joint exercises, even in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: the two countries participated in a joint aerial patrol over the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, and the Western Pacific just three months after the start of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several different factors drive China’s participation in joint exercises with Russia. First, Chinese strategists consider joint exercises a unique means for the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to gain overseas operational experience. In the early years of China-Russia joint exercises, the PLA focused on learning from the more experienced Russian military, but it has increasingly positioned itself to gain experience as an equal — or even more senior — partner. Second, authoritative Chinese writings make clear that, despite officials’ claims that exercises are not aimed at “third parties,” Beijing considers joint exercises with Russia to be an important tool of deterrence vis-à-vis the United States and its allies and partners. In recent years, the two sides have timed and positioned their exercises in response to specific geopolitical developments to maximize signaling power. Third, exercises provide a means of collectively shaping security dynamics within the region, especially through exercises linked to the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Chinese thinkers specifically see opportunities to use multilateral SCO exercises with Russia to improve China’s image among regional countries and reassure China’s neighbors about Beijing’s willingness to play a supportive role in the region. Finally, Chinese experts repeatedly point out that joint exercises with Russia play an important role in strengthening and sustaining the broader bilateral relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines each of these elements, with a focus on analyzing recent texts and statements from authoritative sources and Chinese analysts. It concludes with an examination of broader implications and potential trends that may emerge within China-Russia joint military exercises, especially in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gaining-military-experience&quot;&gt;Gaining Military Experience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China, which has not engaged in a large-scale military conflict in more than four decades, military exercises with Russia are a unique opportunity to gain military experience. Science of Military Strategy, an authoritative textbook published by China’s National Defense University, details the benefits of joint exercises to China’s broader military modernization efforts. It notes that, through joint exercises, the PLA “can not only understand the geographical conditions or sea conditions of overseas mission areas, but also accumulate troop training experience, cultivate joint operations awareness, and improve the organization and command capabilities of command agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conducting joint exercises with Russia enables the PLA to gain experience in operating in areas far beyond China’s borders. In 2015, the two countries participated in joint naval drills in the Mediterranean Sea focused on navigation safety, at-sea replenishment, escort missions, and live fire exercises. China and Russia had previously held naval exercises in the waters of the Pacific but had not ventured as far as the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint exercises also offer the PLA opportunities to gain operational experience in a growing variety of domains. The first several exercises between China and Russia were largely land-based and focused on counterterrorism operations. However, recent years have seen China and Russia significantly widen the aperture of their exercises. The two countries held their first joint naval exercise in 2012 and have conducted several since. In October 2021, China and Russia conducted their first joint naval patrol, which Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the Naval Research Academy, described as being of “vital importance” for practicing real-world drills. China and Russia also expanded their cooperation into conducting joint aerial patrols over the Western Pacific Ocean. The first of these came in 2019, with three additional patrols in 2020, 2021, and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese experts do not consider joint exercises to be vanity projects; they describe the exercises as having substantive value. An article in the Chinese military magazine Tanks and Armored Vehicles describes joint exercises with Russia as “highly practical” and featuring “joint planning, joint operational synergy, long-range delivery capabilities and military firepower strikes, and integrated joint command systems and joint logistical support capabilities.” Chinese experts also frequently emphasize the benefits that the PLA can reap by learning from the Russian military’s decades of experience competing with the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this dynamic is evolving as the PLA’s capabilities grow and as China widens its lead over Russia in terms of overall national power. Instead of focusing on how China can learn from Russia, Chinese commentators now often emphasize that both sides can benefit from military exercises, with Russia learning from operating with China’s more modernized forces. For example, a 2016 commentary notes that the Russian naval fleet is largely comprised of outdated Soviet-era vessels and equipment, while Chinese vessels have largely been built in the twenty-first century. Another Chinese expert argues that Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) “are only suitable for the kind of battlefield in East Ukraine that does not emphasize movement warfare, and are easily defeated on high-intensity battlefields by advanced adversaries like the U.S. military.” This analysis concludes, “[Chinese] composite battalions have significantly surpassed the Russians in terms of weapons and equipment performance,” but it acknowledges Russian BTGs have the advantage of being battle-tested, while Chinese battalions do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more significantly, China has begun to flip the status quo by taking on a leading role in exercises while Russia participates from a more junior position. The “Zapad/Interaction-2021” exercise (also known in Chinese as “Western-Joint 2021”) was the first major example of this. Official PLA media described it as the first time that Russian forces participated in exercises held entirely in China and led by the PLA, and that Russian forces used Chinese weaponry. Li Shuyin, a researcher at the Academy of Military Sciences and an expert on Russian military issues, emphasized the uniqueness of Zapad/Interaction-2021, describing it as “a change of roles” and an opportunity to create a joint exercise “brand” mainly focused on China’s military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterring-the-united-states-and-its-allies&quot;&gt;Deterring the United States and Its Allies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another emerging trend in China-Russia joint exercises is an increased willingness to use the exercises in a more provocative manner to signal to third parties. Chinese officials and state-run media sources have frequently asserted that joint exercises with Russia are for bilateral purposes and not aimed at third parties. In the runup to the first China-Russia bilateral exercise, Peace Mission 2005, China’s then-defense minister Cao Gangchuan stated that military cooperation (including joint exercises) “is not targeted at any third party,” and instead it “serves the interest of regional and world peace.” China’s Ministry of National Defense spokesman Wu Qian made very similar statements about a recent May 2022 joint air patrol, emphasizing the patrol “did not target any third party, and has nothing to do with the current international and regional situations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, authoritative sources indicate the opposite is true. China’s Science of Military Strategy includes an entire section on the role of military exercises within its chapter on strategic deterrence. The 2020 version of the textbook states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Military exercises against specific threats are not only effective methods of military training but also an important way to implement strategic deterrence . . . The exercise not only demonstrates the Chinese army’s combat capabilities to adversaries, but also causes doubts, making them uncertain about our intentions and making it difficult to determine whether we are conducting routine training, maintaining close diplomatic relations, or taking the opportunity to move into actual combat operations, thereby causing psychological panic and conduct a deterrent effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese experts and commentators also frequently contradict official statements. Qin An, director of the China Institute of Cyberspace Strategy and a frequent commentator on foreign policy issues, notes that large-scale exercises with Russia showcase the countries’ “determination and will” and play a role in deterring adversaries. He specifically highlights the “strategic significance” of the exercises in warning the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of joint exercises as a tool for deterrent signaling to third parties is by no means a new phenomenon. What is new is the bolder and more direct way that Beijing and Moscow are willing to use exercises to send signals. Amid negotiations over the first China-Russia bilateral exercise (Peace Mission 2005), Beijing sought to hold the exercise in Fujian Province, the closest mainland Chinese province to Taiwan. Russia pushed back in fear of escalation and being pulled into a Taiwan Strait conflict, and the two sides eventually settled on holding exercises in Shandong Province, well to the north of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The use of joint exercises as a tool for deterrent signaling to third parties is by no means a new phenomenon. What is new is the bolder and more direct way that Beijing and Moscow are willing to use exercises to send signals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid growing tensions with the United States and its allies, China and Russia have demonstrated their willingness to use joint exercises in more targeted ways in response to specific geopolitical developments. Just two months after the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling that invalidated China’s claims over much of the South China Sea, China and Russia launched Joint Sea 2016, a naval military exercise, in the South China Sea. Both countries stated this exercise was not directed at a third country, but the uniqueness of the exercise and its timing were widely seen as a response to the tribunal’s ruling; Joint Sea 2016 remains the only naval exercise the two countries have held in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, in May 2022, China and Russia conducted a joint aerial patrol over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea that coincided with a summit of the leaders of the Quadrilateral Strategic Dialogue (Quad) in Tokyo. The patrol — which included four Chinese H-6 bombers, two Russian Tu-95 bombers, and one Russian Il-20 electronic intelligence aircraft — passed through the air defense identification zones of Japan and South Korea, leading both countries to scramble their own planes. Chinese officials maintain this was a regular exercise that has taken place every year since 2019. However, the timing of the patrol, coupled with the fact that all three previous aerial patrols were held in the second half of the year, made it clear the exercises were directed at the Quad summit. The patrol was also the first joint exercise since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and was therefore widely seen as a symbol of Beijing’s continued alignment with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shoring-up-regional-stability-and-security&quot;&gt;Shoring Up Regional Stability and Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third major driver for China is a desire to use joint exercises with Russia to shape security dynamics within China and along its periphery. This includes deterring perceived terrorist or separatist threats and reassuring neighboring countries of Chinese and Russian intentions and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to deterring the United States and its allies, China and Russia both seek to use joint exercises to deter perceived internal and external threats from terrorism and separatism. Beijing and Moscow share similar threat assessments that the United States and its allies aim to encircle and isolate China and Russia and undermine them by provoking “color revolutions.” China is particularly worried about the possibility of instability or separatist activity spilling over from Central and South Asia into its western Xinjiang and Tibet regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SCO is an important part of Beijing’s efforts to counter these perceived threats. China’s Science of Military Strategy predicts that counterterrorism will continually grow in importance for China, and it notes that strengthening SCO-related counterterrorism exercises will be a key factor in responding to the threat. From Beijing’s perspective, large and complex exercises with Russia (and other SCO countries) help to prepare China and partner countries to deal with these issues while also deterring would-be terrorist or separatist groups that might threaten stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, bilateral and multilateral exercises with Russia play a role in shaping perceptions within governments in the region. First and foremost, they aim to help convince neighboring countries that China and Russia have both the capability and the will to address threats to security and stability in the region. Joint exercises simultaneously aim to ease worries in neighboring countries about Beijing’s intentions. China’s Science of Military Strategy emphasizes that China must go to lengths to ensure that it adheres to international laws, norms, and procedures in conducting exercises with regional partners, since doing so increases those countries’ perceptions that China respects them and their interests. In this light, joint exercises are viewed by China as not just a practical means of enhancing operational capabilities but also an important tool for peripheral diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;supporting-the-broader-china-russia-relationship&quot;&gt;Supporting the Broader China-Russia Relationship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one Chinese commentary puts it, joint exercises are “the most sensitive activity two countries can partake in.” Thus, they naturally play an important role in building trust between the Chinese and Russian strategic communities and strengthening the broader China-Russia bilateral relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese and Russian leaders have repeatedly stressed that they share a strong relationship, there is nevertheless a considerable amount of distrust between them. In particular, Moscow harbors concerns about Chinese theft of Russian intellectual property (IP) with respect to military technologies and worries that China may ultimately seek to capitalize on its IP thefts to compete with Russia in the global arms market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint military exercises can overcome some distrust by facilitating exchanges at multiple levels between the Chinese and Russian military and strategic communities. Recent joint exercises such as Zapad/Interaction-2021 witnessed the two militaries not just jointly conducting exercises but actively collaborating in planning and commanding the exercises. Exercises also afford opportunities for the two countries’ military leaders to meet and publicly demonstrate high-level cooperation. Following major military exercises in 2018, Central Military Commission vice chairman Zhang Youxia and Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu met for talks in Beijing. In a statement following the meeting, Zhang commented that the “China–Russia comprehensive strategic coordination partnership has reached an all-time high.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercises also enable China and Russia to increase trust and transparency by demonstrating their military equipment to each other, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of their forces. Several important Chinese platforms participated in the Zapad/Interaction-2021, including the KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft, J-20 and J-16 fighters, Y-20 transport planes, and surveillance and combat drones. All in all, official Chinese media note that more than 80 percent of the Chinese equipment used in the exercise was new, giving Russia a close-up look at some of China’s most advanced systems. Russia has taken this a step further by intentionally using certain equipment, such as the advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile system, in exercises with China with the hopes of selling those items to the PLA. In this way, exercises play an important part in building trust and transparency within the broader bilateral relationship, but they also directly facilitate other forms of military-to-military cooperation, such as arms sales and high-level exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note, however, that there are limitations at play. One issue is the language barrier that exists between their militaries. Unlike North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, which typically conduct exercises in a shared language (English), China and Russia communicate using their respective languages. The PLA has insisted this is a non-issue and that “soldiers from the two countries could communicate with body language, simple English and even eye contact.” There have also been reports of Chinese officers learning Russian for certain joint military exercises. However, during the Zapad/Interaction-2021 exercises, the two countries used a bilingual command information system to ensure that both sides were able to fully understand commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-and-potential-emerging-trends&quot;&gt;Implications and Potential Emerging Trends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint military exercises remain an important and enduring element of the China-Russia relationship. Analysts of both China and Russia should continue monitoring China-Russia exercises for new and emergent trends. This is especially important in light of Russia’s war in Ukraine — the impacts of which continue to ripple around the world. So far, there is no evidence that the war has had any specific effect on joint exercises. The timing and nature of the May 2022 joint aerial patrol suggest that, for now, the two sides are compartmentalizing the war so as not to disrupt exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible, however, that the war could have consequences for China-Russia joint exercises in the medium to long term. The Russian military has performed remarkably poorly in Ukraine — even after revising its initial disastrous approach to focus on more limited aims — and the war has proven costly and deadly for Russia. If Beijing assesses Russia’s performance in Ukraine to be bad enough, that could compel China to rethink the educational and training value of joint exercises with Russia. It may even lead China to question the overall value of its strategic ties with Russia. In the long term, a deeply weakened and overstretched Russian military could compound this by lacking the capacity to carry out large-scale exercises with any frequency. In one scenario, this may lead China and Russia to pivot toward narrower, smaller-scale exercises that are focused less on operational benefits and more on political signaling — like the recent aerial patrols. In another scenario, the two sides could continue with their existing pace and scale of exercises, but with China more consistently leading as the senior military partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is worth noting that China and Russia may face an increasingly competitive environment with respect to military exercises in the Asia-Pacific region as European countries step up their military and security presence there. In 2021, the United Kingdom sent a carrier strike group to the region for the first time since 1997. The deployment saw Royal Navy vessels participating in multilateral exercises in the Philippine Sea, alongside U.S., Japanese, Canadian, Dutch, and New Zealand naval forces. The war in Ukraine could unexpectedly catalyze Europe’s turn to the Asia-Pacific region: when NATO foreign ministers met in April 2022 to address the war in Ukraine, they also voiced calls to counter Russian aggression in the Asia-Pacific by partnering with regional countries on issues including cybersecurity, emerging technologies, and maritime security (among others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increased European presence in the region — on top of the already large U.S. and allied presence — would be an unwelcome development for Beijing and Moscow and could ultimately impact China-Russia joint exercises in the area going forward. If exercises become more politically focused and both countries are facing what they view to be a more hostile and competitive environment, it is possible they could ramp up the frequency of exercises to demonstrate their joint resolve and unity in the face of perceived threats — assuming that Russia has the capacity. If both countries continue to deepen their strategic relationship and partnership, they may also be open to engaging in exercises in areas that they may have previously deemed too sensitive, such as those closer to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sino-russian-space-cooperation-and-what-it-means-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Sino-Russian Space Cooperation and What It Means for the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-2&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late February 2022, during the first week of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Russian space agency Roscosmos made several announcements that weakened space relations with the United States and European countries. The agency canceled a launch of British commercial satellites unless certain conditions were met, including the UK government’s financial withdrawal from the company. It also announced it was suspending cooperation with European partners in organizing space launches from French Guinea. Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the agency, said that the United States could no longer participate in a planned Russian mission to Venus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated by statements from Rogozin and the agency, the rapid deterioration of relations with the West since February 2022 has accelerated a trend of increased Sino-Russian collaboration in space. Instead of partnering with the United States, Rogozin ordered his team to coordinate with Beijing for deep space missions. When discussing sanctions from Western countries that would target supplies of microelectronics necessary for spacecraft, he also emphasized Russia’s relationship with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, this intensifying cooperation poses several challenges. Heightened Russian and Chinese space collaboration could enable U.S. strategic competitors to achieve more capable and integrated space systems and could complicate agreements on space security issues. However, the development is not all negative. Like the United States, China has pursued international space partnerships in recent years. Given Russia’s reduced standing in the world as a result of its war in Ukraine, Beijing’s growing partnership with Moscow could make it harder for China to recruit other countries to collaborate. This dynamic could eventually push China away from Russia, opening possibilities for more negotiations on space security issues between Washington and Beijing. In short, the space relationship between Russia and China could take different turns, which could present challenges and opportunities for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-and-chinas-space-collaboration&quot;&gt;Russia and China’s Space Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian and Chinese space collaboration falls into two categories: (1) technology and capability development and (2) space diplomacy. While some of the joint space diplomatic efforts date back at least to the early 2000s, much of the technology and capability development collaboration has been more recent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technology-and-capability-development&quot;&gt;Technology and Capability Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China’s cooperation on space technology and capabilities has grown partly out of necessity. U.S. and Russian scholars and experts attribute this increasing cooperation, at least in part, to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Prior to that, the United States and Russia had enjoyed an effective and expansive space partnership, highlighted in 1993 when President Bill Clinton invited Russia to join the International Space Station (ISS) program as a full partner. Although the countries remained partners on the ISS after the Crimea invasion, their broader space relationship has suffered. Reduced U.S.-Russian space collaboration created an opening for China, which the United States had excluded from the ISS and from other joint civil space activity. Since 2014, space cooperation between Russia and China has, according to Russian space experts, “further expanded and deepened, forming a China-Russia space cooperation relationship with space technology, space science, and space equipment intertwined.” The technical collaboration has made sense: China has ample resources and has been willing to engage extensively with Russia, and Russia has 70 years of experience and expertise to offer Beijing’s rapidly developing space program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early area for cooperation was on navigation satellites. Both Russia and China have global navigation satellite systems: GLONASS (Russian) and BeiDou (Chinese). In 2014, the two countries established a senior-level committee on “strategic cooperation in satellite navigation.” The committee formed working groups that covered compatibility and interoperability, augmentation and station construction, monitoring and assessment, and joint applications. In 2019, the two countries jointly developed a multi-frequency radio chip designed to support both satellite constellations. In the same year, Russia passed a law establishing cooperation between Russia and China on using GLONASS and BeiDou for peaceful purposes. In 2021, the Russian space agency announced that Russia would start placing GLONASS ground stations in China, while China would start placing BeiDou ground stations in Russia. This cooperation reflects increasing partnership on capabilities that are important for both civil and military applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where Russia and China have collaborated recently is deep space. In March 2021, the two countries signed a historic agreement to build a base on the moon together. They have also signed agreements to create a joint lunar and deep space data center with hubs in both Russia and China, and they plan to cooperate on each other’s missions to survey the lunar south pole. As some Russian thinkers argue, Russia’s deepening links with China in this area may be driven by a desire to not get left behind technologically as other powers pay closer attention to space beyond geosynchronous Earth orbit for scientific and military purposes. This collaboration is also striking because space exploration has historically been an area in which Russia and the United States have collaborated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Sino-Russian space partnership could also be extending to strategic military capabilities. Both Russian and Chinese outlets have reported that Russia is helping China develop a space-based missile warning system. Currently, only the United States and Russia have space-based missile warning systems, although other countries have expressed interest in developing their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some examples of burgeoning Russian and Chinese space cooperation. In August 2017, Russia and China signed a five-year agreement to continue collaborating in space from 2018 to 2022. In a 2019 meeting on space cooperation, they reaffirmed support for mutual endeavors in remote sensing, rocket engines and launch vehicles, and low-orbit satellite communications systems. The two countries reportedly are nearing another five-year agreement, to be signed in 2023, to outline their commitment to continue working together in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Space Diplomacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way in which Russia and China have cooperated on space issues is through diplomacy. In 2002, the two countries submitted a joint working paper focused on preventing the deployment of weapons in space to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament. The working paper served as the basis for a draft treaty that Russia and China introduced in 2008 called the “Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects,” commonly known as PPWT. In 2014, Russia reintroduced a revised version of PPWT. Due to objections from the United States and other countries, these proposals have not made progress in the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine that PPWT could ever turn into an international agreement. The aim of the proposal is to prohibit weapons from being deployed in space but not to ban weapons that could target objects in space. The treaty would omit any restriction on ground-based anti-satellite weapons, which both Russia and China have tested in the last two decades and which are often characterized as the most likely kinetic threat to space systems. Further, prohibiting weapons in space is difficult to verify because virtually anything in space could be used as a weapon. Space robots can refuel spacecraft to extend a satellite’s life — or tear the solar panels off to kill it. Lasers can provide rapid and secure communications — or destroy sensors and other delicate satellite systems. More generally, given the speeds with which objects travel in space, something as small as five centimeters in diameter could produce an amount of energy comparable to being hit by a bus. Given these limitations, the United States and other countries will likely remain unpersuaded by PPWT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it will likely never become a treaty, PPWT has become a political tool for Russia and China. In 2014, 125 countries voted for PPWT; in contrast, only three countries voted with the United States against it. Both Russia and China point to the proposal as evidence that they support peaceful purposes of outer space in contrast with the United States, which they accuse of “weaponizing” space. They have used the treaty and their rhetoric to deflect from their own activities. After Russia’s anti-satellite weapon test in November 2021, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov called on the United States to negotiate over PPWT, a document that “Russia and China are proposing to prevent this arms race and which the U.S. cannot accept.” In May 2021, China’s space policies drew criticism because a Chinese rocket body was falling uncontrollably back to Earth, which could have caused damage depending on where it crashed. Asked about the measures China was taking to deal with the falling rocket, a Chinese spokesperson responded: “As a principle, China is committed to the peaceful use of outer space and believes we should conduct international cooperation in this area.” Of course, a commitment to peaceful uses of outer space has little to do with inappropriate disposal of a space launch vehicle that then comes hurtling back to Earth. In both these cases, PPWT and a supposed commitment to peaceful purposes of outer space provided Russia and China a rhetorical means to deflect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-transatlantic-security&quot;&gt;Implications for Transatlantic Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing Sino-Russian space cooperation has concerning implications for transatlantic security. It means these U.S. competitors are becoming more capable and integrated. It also makes it harder for the United States and its allies to negotiate with either country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear complication for the United States of Sino-Russian space cooperation is that China benefits from Russia’s expertise, and Russia benefits from China’s resources. Another complication is that this technical cooperation could lead to more integrated capabilities that could be used in war. If a war extended to space, both countries could interpret an attack on the same asset as an attack on both countries. Perhaps most worryingly, this integration could also progress to the countries collaborating on counter-space. “Defense planners need to look for indications that suggest Russia and China are moving toward cooperation in the counter-space field out of a growing fear of U.S. dominance in space,” writes Jeffrey Edmonds of the Center for Naval Analyses, warning that joint Russian-Chinese counter-space exercises “should not be discounted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sino-Russian diplomatic front means that finding compromise may require convincing both countries collectively rather than convincing each one individually. Further, part of why PPWT has generated international support is that both powers have been committed to it, and in turn this international support may make both countries more likely to dismiss alternatives to PPWT — even if those alternatives are in their interest. One such alternative was introduced by the United Kingdom: a 2021 UN resolution to establish an open-ended working group that would “make recommendations on possible norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors relating to threats by States to space systems.” The resolution passed in a 163-8 vote, with nine abstentions. Those opposed were Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Syria. Given that they are both space powers, Russia and China would benefit from participating in such an effort; it would seem to be in everyone’s interest to consider issues like the types of behaviors that may be perceived as threatening if not accompanied by advance notice and protocols that could be put in place to lessen the likelihood of unintentional conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China’s concerted diplomacy also leads them to defend each other’s worst actions. Russia’s 2021 anti-satellite test is a case in point. The test created thousands of pieces of debris, much of which remains in orbit; the presence of the debris degrades the operating environment for all space actors. Because the United States has the most satellites in orbit, such degradation creates a higher likelihood that one of its assets could be affected. It is also particularly harmful for China, which has the second most satellites in orbit. In fact, in January 2022, a Chinese satellite was reported to have experienced a near miss with a piece of debris created by Russia’s test. But even in this instance, China refrained from publicly blaming its partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolving-dynamic&quot;&gt;Evolving Dynamic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space dynamic between Russia, China, and the United States — which has changed considerably in recent years — could change further because of Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine. According to some Russian space experts, Russia’s interest in close collaboration with China on space issues is likely to remain strong. The partnership has brought Russia more resources for space ventures and more support for arms control proposals targeted at the United States. Any rupture in this partnership could undermine Russia’s goal of remaining a leading space nation and weaken its space diplomatic agenda. What remains less clear is how, if at all, Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine will affect how China views this partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the desire to continue along a course of cooperation with China is driven in part by necessity. Sanctions levied against Russian companies are bound to limit Russia’s capacity to provide commercial space services — which some Russian thinkers considered as a way to sustain Russia’s space program in the long term — and the already low level of state funding for space ventures could attenuate further as Russia’s economy contracts. In this context, funding from China — and to a lesser extent, other countries with nascent space programs — is crucial for Russia to meet its space ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What remains less clear is how, if at all, Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine will affect how China views this partnership.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China, there is a considerable downside to further integration with Russia’s space efforts. China is actively pursuing space partnerships and wants to be recognized as a world leader in space. It has space research cooperative agreements with Argentina, Brazil, Pakistan, France, and Malaysia, among other countries. Such partnerships offer important advantages, including being able to spread the cost of operating in space or the cost of developing a capability. Also, in a crisis or war, a country may be less likely to attack a spacecraft that could be owned by or supporting multiple countries than a spacecraft that is owned by and supporting only one country. Because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, countries and companies are severing ties with Russia. As a result, the more China integrates with Russia in space — the more the two countries are perceived as inseparable — the harder it may be for China to recruit new partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Ukraine crisis, China could follow the precedent set in 2014. When Russia annexed Crimea, China seized the opportunity, establishing more technical cooperation with Russia on space and filling the void left by the United States and others. Because integration with Russia could weaken China’s ability to become a global leader in space, however, China could distance itself from Russia instead. China may not need as much technical assistance as it did in 2014, and Russia’s standing in the world is much lower now than it was then. Along these lines, Todd Harrison, then the director for the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: “China seems to be very tactical and pragmatic with the agreements that they make, and I don’t know that Russia has that much to offer anymore, especially after this [invasion of Ukraine]. . . . And there’s a lot of baggage that’s going to come with partnering with Russia from now on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China did reduce its space cooperation with Russia, that could offer an opportunity for more dialogue with the United States. This is not going to lessen all tensions between the two countries, but it could create some meaningful discussions on space. Newsweek reported in December 2021 that the Biden administration is considering approaching China on bilateral space arms control. Less ambitious measures could be valuable as well. With the amount of activity in space increasing dramatically, the need for mundane principles and rules — along the lines of maritime right-of-way rules — is becoming more important, particularly between the two countries with the most assets in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should pay close attention to the space relationship between Russia and China. A tighter connection will pose considerable challenges, such as potential adversaries developing more sophisticated and integrated systems and maintaining a diplomatic front that impedes efforts to establish norms, rules, and principles on space behavior. A more detached relationship could create auspicious circumstances for bilateral negotiation between China and the United States. The United States would benefit from considering the options and consequences that come with these different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china-russia-cooperation-in-space&quot;&gt;China-Russia Cooperation in Space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reality behind the Speeches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;marc-julienne&quot;&gt;Marc Julienne&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China-Russia cooperation in space has been increasing for the past two decades. This cooperation accelerated after the Crimea crisis in 2014 and culminated with the announcement in 2021 of the joint construction of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). Yet, behind the hype around the countries’ “rock-solid friendship,” the reality of this bilateral cooperation is more complex. Space cooperation is very strong when it comes to diplomacy, but it has proven to be limited in technical terms. Overall, the ambitious space partnership touted by China and Russia may well be exaggerated, considering three factors: Russian space budgets have been declining for years; the war in Ukraine will most likely undermine Russia’s budget and technical means for space even further; and China and Russia have persisting mistrust that tends to slow down any real, integrated technical cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly based on Chinese sources, this paper intends to assess the bilateral partnership in space from a Chinese perspective, going through the historical background, the current cooperation programs, and the two countries’ common front in space diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-history-of-china-russia-cooperation-in-space&quot;&gt;The History of China-Russia Cooperation in Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in many other domains of the China-Russia bilateral relationship, there are two distinctive phases of cooperation: before and after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a decade of intense scientific and technical cooperation in the 1950s, all cooperation abruptly ceased as a result of the Sino-Soviet split in 1960. It was not until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 that both countries embraced a fresh start. In 1992, they signed the intergovernmental “Agreement about the Cooperation on Research and Peaceful use of Outer Space,” which was followed by a similar protocol signed between the China National Space Agency (CNSA) and the Russian Space Agency (now known as the Federal Space Agency, or Roscosmos) in 1994. A cooperation agreement on piloted spaceflight was signed in 1996, just four years after China launched its piloted space program. This represented a much more concrete step compared to the two previous agreements. It allowed China to benefit from Russia’s assistance for the development of its own spacecraft — the Shenzhou — based on the Soyuz design, as well as space suits and training for Chinese taikonauts. This cooperation enabled China to conduct four unmanned flight tests of the Shenzhou spacecraft between 1999 and 2003 and its first manned mission, Shenzhou-5, in October 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trend of closer cooperation in space continued throughout the 2000s and early 2010s. In 2000, the two countries brought their space dialogue to a more regular basis with the establishment of the China-Russia Space Cooperation Sub-Committee, held during the annual meetings of their prime ministers. In 2007, they signed an agreement on the joint exploration of Mars, with China being a minor contributor. The Russian Fobos-Grunt mission consisted of a sample return from the Martian moon Phobos; it was supposed to carry a Chinese probe (Yinghuo-1) into Mars’s orbit, but it failed shortly after launch in November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While bilateral cooperation developed effectively from the 1990s to the 2010s, it remained a mostly commercially oriented relationship, wherein Russia sold technology and know-how to China within certain limits. As He Qisong and Ye Nishan from the East China University of Political Science and Law in Shanghai noted in an August 2021 paper, China-Russia space cooperation “lacked depth” before 2014 and did not match the level of the political engagement officially declared by the two sides; it existed merely at a “superficial level” (浅层次).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for limited cooperation at the time was Russia’s lack of will to engage in a close partnership with China. Moscow simply did not want China to progress too quickly and eventually catch up and outperform Russia. Wang Ye and Zhou Yuan, from the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), write that “the Russian government became increasingly cautious about cooperating with China’s space program, mainly for fear of creating a formidable space competitor, and also for the fear of angering the United States, the most important space partner at the time.” A December 2006 public statement by the then-head of Roscosmos, Anatoly Perminov, confirmed this assessment: “Russia will cooperate with China on space projects but will not transfer sensitive technologies that could enable Beijing to become a rival in a future space race.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 marked a major turn in Russia’s overall relationship with China. Moscow found itself isolated diplomatically and faced a wave of sanctions from Western countries as well as from Japan, which were directed in part against its space industry. Moscow then turned to Beijing for political and economic support — albeit at the cost of several concessions, like the transfer of technology in sensitive sectors, including weaponry and space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China had a significant interest in collaborating more closely with Russia, as the Wolf Amendment passed by the U.S. Congress in 2011 excluded China from any project involving NASA (including the International Space Station), and the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) prohibited any export or reexport of U.S. space technology or components to China. As the Russian space industry found itself targeted by sanctions after 2014 and Russia-U.S. space cooperation was drastically undermined, Moscow had an incentive to seek deeper cooperation with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contemporary-space-cooperation-great-announcements-but-limited-technical-cooperation&quot;&gt;Contemporary Space Cooperation: Great Announcements but Limited Technical Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Crimea crisis, the two countries pushed forward their cooperation in space in the fields of global navigation satellite systems, lunar exploration, and military space systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIDOU-GLONASS SATELLITE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS COORDINATION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2014, Moscow and Beijing established the Russia-China Project Committee on Important Strategic Cooperation in Satellite Navigation, which convenes annually to study the integration potential of BeiDou and GLONASS constellations. The committee is divided into four working groups: compatibility and interoperability, enhanced system and station construction, monitoring and evaluation, and joint application. This led to the signature by Prime Ministers Li Keqiang and Dimitry Medvedev in November 2018 of the Cooperation Agreement on the Peaceful Use of BeiDou and GLONASS Global Navigation Satellite Systems, which aimed to guide joint work on the compatibility (ability to use one system or another) and interoperability (ability to use both systems at the same time, providing better accuracy) of the two systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2021, the two countries adopted the “2021–2025 China-Russia Roadmap for Cooperation in Satellite Navigation” to further advance their joint work in this field. According to the road map, each country is expected to deploy BeiDou and GLONASS ground stations in the other country. Roscosmos announced that Russian ground stations would be located in Shanghai, Urumqi (northwestern Xinjiang region), and Changchun (northeastern Jilin Province), while Chinese ground stations would be placed at Obninsk (near Moscow), Irkutsk (Baikal Lake area), and Petropavlovsk-Kamtchatski (Kamchatka Peninsula). A further step toward the integration of Russian and Chinese satellite constellations took place with the signature of the Cooperation Agreement on Time Interoperability of BeiDou and GLONASS Global Navigation Satellite Systems, which occurred on the sidelines of the bilateral summit between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin in Beijing on February 4, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite guiding a range of joint Sino-Russian activities in space, few details are available on the 2021–2025 roadmap. It remains unclear how the two countries will overcome the important technical obstacles to achieve full interoperability between the two constellations. Nevertheless, if successfully achieved, the interoperability between BeiDou and GLONASS would allow better performance and a wider range (GLONASS covering higher northern regions and BeiDou lower southern regions), which could have an effect on each country’s military capabilities, as it would improve missile guidance and positioning for troops, military vehicles, and aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOON EXPLORATION: THE ILRS PROJECT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most emblematic aspect of space cooperation between China and Russia is exploration of the moon, under the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) project. The two countries have discussed the possibility of cooperation in this area for more than 15 years, but it materialized only in March 2021 with the signature of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in the Construction of the ILRS. The project is highly ambitious, consisting of lunar-orbit and lunar-based facilities for a manned mission, with the first modules to be launched in the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the project has attracted significant attention, an analysis of available official documentation on the ILRS reveals certain important inconsistencies. First, the plan provided by the CNSA and Roscosmos to the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) in August 2021 schedules five lunar missions (two Chinese, three Russian) by 2025. This sounds rather ambitious, considering the state of Russian space industry and budget — and the fact that Russia’s last moon mission, Luna 24, took place in 1976. Nonetheless, during a visit to the Vostochny Cosmodrome in April 2022, Putin reaffirmed that he would “restore the moon program” and that “by the third quarter [of this year] the Luna-25 mission must be complete” (although it was initially planned for 2016). This may prove to be a challenge for Russia, considering the global geopolitical context and the sanctions against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, according to the plan, the first ILRS module (launched by a Chinese rocket) is expected to land on the moon in the early 2030s. All following modules (ILRS-2 through ILRS-5) will be launched alternatively by Russian and Chinese launchers by 2035. Among these five ILRS missions, the emphasis is put on lunar surface facilities, but little is said about the circumlunar space station, which would be instrumental to developing facilities on the surface of the moon and would need to be constructed in advance of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides claim that they will cooperate on all aspects of the program, including the coordination of scientific and technical research, development, design, modeling, testing, validation, assembly of the ILRS component parts, and the launching and operation of the facilities. However, it remains unclear what specific tasks and technology each side is going to provide or how much funding each side is ready to dedicate. This raises questions about the sustainability of the program if one of the stakeholders is unable to fulfill its commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these unresolved issues, in late December 2021, Roscosmos announced that China and Russia would sign in 2022 a new space cooperation program for 2023–2027, which should include further details on the plan to develop the ILRS by 2035. However, the war in Ukraine will most likely impact both the ILRS project schedule and the overall nature of bilateral cooperation in space, at least in the short to medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might wonder why China and Russia did not start by cooperating on an Earth orbit joint space laboratory before aiming at the moon. Both countries have experience and ongoing or future projects in this field. Moreover, it could have been a more easily achievable project and could have had a nearer completion date. There are several potential explanations. First, it seems that both China and Russia want to have their own independent space laboratory. Second, China wants to demonstrate that it is capable of building a space station by itself. Third, Russia may also want to maintain a degree of autonomy in space, and this is one of the few areas where it can still do so. Nevertheless, both sides have expressed willingness to cooperate in this field. In June 2021, Dimitry Rogozin revealed that talks with China are ongoing to send Russian cosmonauts onboard the Chinese Tiangong station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHINA-RUSSIA MILITARY COOPERATION IN SPACE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow and Beijing claim to be improving their military space cooperation, though it is difficult to assess its depth and nature. One component is the information exchange mechanism provided by the 2009 Agreement on Mutual Notification of Ballistic Missile and Space Launch Vehicle Launches. By preventing miscalculation, this agreement favors mutual trust and security between the two countries. It was extended for 10 years in December 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia claim to cooperate in two very strategic and sensitive domains: anti-ballistic missiles and early warning systems. During the annual conference of the Valdai Discussion Club in October 2019, Putin revealed that Russia was helping China to build an early warning ballistic system, which would “fundamentally enhance the defense capability of China.” It is also well known that both militaries conducted joint exercises on computer-simulated ballistic missile interception in 2016, 2017, and 2019. While this is consistent with the fact that Russia has provided China with ballistic missile defense software, it remains uncertain whether Moscow would go as far as to help China develop an early warning satellite constellation or ground-based radars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, from where the space dialogue started in the 1990s until today, the discourse and announcements by Russian and Chinese leaders on their flourishing cooperation does not yet match the reality of their technical collaboration, nor does it reflect their ability to commit to their joint programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-diplomacy-china-russia-alignment-against-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Space Diplomacy: China-Russia Alignment against the United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to technical and scientific cooperation, space diplomacy is a field where close cooperation between China and Russia has been taking place since the end of the Cold War. Chinese experts on space emphasize this aspect of their cooperation with Russia more than they do the technical side. He and Ye’s August 2021 article, “An analysis of space cooperation between China and Russia,” devotes only 4 of its 24 pages to technical cooperation, while the rest tackles the issues of space diplomacy, space law, and the geopolitics of space. In their view, China-Russia cooperation in space is the result of improving political bilateral relations and, most importantly, changing geopolitical challenges in space, with “the U.S. strategy of space hegemony” at the top of them. The main goal of China and Russia would be to “maintain the multipolarity of space and the overall stability of the China-U.S.-Russia triangular space relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first threat China and Russia want to address is “the weaponization of space and an arms race in outer space.” The two countries blame the United States for a series of actions that they consider undermining security and stability, both in outer space and on Earth. The U.S. withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 2001 and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019 are cited as examples of such actions. They also condemn Washington for the development of ABM systems and their proliferation, space-based early warning sensors, and space-based missile interceptors, which they characterize as deeply destabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, Russia and China have been very active within multilateral forums such as the UN General Assembly (UNGA), the Conference on Disarmament, and the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) to promote resolutions and treaties against the weaponization of outer space. The main initiative in this field is the draft Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects (PPWT), which was first submitted to the Conference on Disarmament in 2008, where it was blocked by the U.S. delegation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the UNGA, Russia and China submit annual resolutions on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, the prevention of an arms race in outer space, transparency, and confidence-building measures in outer space, no first placement (NFP) of weapons in outer space, and further practical measures for the prevention of a space arms race. These resolutions are generally adopted with a large majority but are nonbinding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second main point of opposition that Russia and China have against the U.S. role in space is the exploitation of extraterrestrial resources, especially on the moon. They fear that the United States is seeking de facto sovereignty over the moon and other celestial bodies. He and Ye analyze that the U.S. government has adopted a four-step approach to this end. The first step was to grant ownership rights to “nongovernmental” (i.e., commercial) entities to exploit space resources through the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015. The second was to change the legal status of the moon and other celestial bodies through the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act of 2018, which provides that “outer space shall not be considered a global commons.” The third step, according to He and Ye, was President Trump’s executive order on April 6, 2020, that rejected the Moon Agreement of 1979 (which the United States did not sign) as a customary law and confirmed that the United States does not view space as a global commons. The fourth step was the introduction of the bilateral Artemis Accords in 2020, which set a new U.S.-led framework for moon exploration. For He and Ye, these accords “constitute a ‘space version of NATO’ in an attempt to seize lunar sovereignty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Chinese experts, however, the exploitation of extraterrestrial resources does not seem to be as important as the weaponization of space. In fact, some scholars, including international law professor Ma Chengyuan from China University of Political Science and Law, are rather understanding of the U.S. position, pointing to loopholes in international law on the question of exploitation of extraterrestrial resources. They also acknowledge that formulating a new treaty in the next few years is unrealistic, considering the expected opposition from countries that lack the ability to exploit such resources. This rather soft approach on resource exploitation was also reflected by the lack of any mention of this issue in the China-Russia joint statement of February 4, 2022 — whereas the document devoted two full paragraphs to the prevention of weaponizing outer space. This can be explained by the fact that both China and the United States are well aware that counting on international law is a dead end to legally exploit space resources. In this sense, the U.S. unilateral approach to lunar exploitation is an example that is likely to be replicated by China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;three-key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Three Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERSISTING MISTRUST BETWEEN CHINA AND RUSSIA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind what China presents as a “rock-solid friendship,” it is worth keeping in mind that Sino-Russian relations are not without divergences. The relationship is often described in official discourse as “at its best in history.” However, as Yang Cheng, professor at the Shanghai International Studies University and a specialist on China-Russia relations, notes: “‘the best’ does not mean that there are no flaws in the cooperation.” Considering the rocky history of bilateral ties in the Soviet era, the relationship has indeed improved significantly, but it is still far from an alliance. It is closer to tactical solidarity than mutual trust, and in the field of space, it is closer to a diplomatic alignment than full scientific and technical integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an increasing imbalance between China and Russia that gives Beijing an advantage over Moscow. This feeling of superiority — and sometimes disdain — shows through Chinese experts’ analysis. He and Ye, for instance, underline that “the lack of funding for the development of Russia’s space industry, and the aging and loss of scientific and technical personnel, including in the space field, have further led to the slow development of Russia’s space technology and industry, and even to difficulties in maintaining satellite ground facilities. The progress of space projects, especially large-scale ones, is lagging behind expectations, or even seriously behind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is an increasing imbalance between China and Russia that gives Beijing an advantage over Moscow. This feeling of superiority — and sometimes disdain — shows through Chinese experts’ analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, He and Ye note, the number of Russian satellites in orbit has not increased by much in the past few years (about 8 more satellites a year), while the number of U.S. and Chinese satellites has risen drastically (about 266 and 47 more satellites a year, respectively). Li Ziguo and Li Yan, both researchers at the China Institute of International Studies (CIIS), also note that “according to the Global Innovation Index reports released by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in recent years, China’s world ranking has continued to rise, from 29th in 2015 to 14th in 2020,” while Russia had been hovering at the 45th place between 2015 and 2019 before downgrading to 47th out of 131 countries in 2020. However, they lucidly recognize Russian excellence in basic science (six Fields Medals and five Nobel Prizes in Physics since 1991), and consider that, with limited access to Western technologies, “deepening the scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries is an inevitable choice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this feeling of superiority, China also has doubts about its Russian partner. One major doubt is about Moscow’s will and means to fulfill its commitments with China. Chinese experts note that since Russia is unable to implement its own national space program, cooperative projects with China are all the more uncertain. Beijing is also aware that its space partnership with Russia depends on the state of the cooperation between Moscow and Washington; any improvement in Russia’s cooperation with Washington would mean a distancing from Beijing. Finally, Russia also cooperates with India in space. Indeed, as an emerging space power, India is very interested in Russia’s know-how, and it is an attractive partner for Russia in turn. As illustrated by the December 2021 joint statement by Putin and Narendra Modi, the two sides have committed to cooperate in human spaceflight and satellite navigation, which may represent a source of concern for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE IMPACT OF THE WAR IN UKRAINE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the 2014 Crimea crisis accelerated overall cooperation between China and Russia — including in space — one may wonder about the potential consequences of the war in Ukraine for the future of the bilateral partnership. Will it open a new phase of deepening cooperation, or will it slow it down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, Russia will become even more dependent on China if it wants to stay in the space race, and China will have another useful lever to impose on the orientations and the scope of the partnership. Despite the Chinese narrative of “win-win cooperation” in space, and despite the fact that Chinese experts present bilateral cooperation as “highly complementary,” one should expect that Russian cooperation with China will mostly fuel the latter’s space program and ambitions, rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the war in Ukraine may also put a stop to China-Russia cooperation in space, and to the ILRS project more specifically. Russia’s space industry was already in a dire situation before the war, and now it is in a critical position after new waves of sanctions and being cut off from cooperation with Western space powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE NEED FOR MULTILATERALISM AND STRONGER WESTERN ALTERNATIVES IN SPACE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sino-Russian rapprochement in space geopolitics has taken advantage of the vacuum left by the United States and other space powers in international forums. While the joint PPWT proposal is far from acceptable due to its many loopholes (e.g., the lack of definition of a weapon in outer space, the exclusion of ground-based anti-space weapons, and the absence of a control mechanism), no alternative was offered by Western countries to develop an international legislative framework to address the weaponization of space. The sole exception is the European Union International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities, which was submitted in 2010 but remains in limbo today. The lack of counterproposal to the PPWT fuels Moscow and Beijing’s narrative of the United States’ unilateral weaponization of outer space — a view that is widely supported at the UNGA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the United States is indeed taking a unilateral path — by adopting federal laws on celestial bodies. This approach undermines international law and multilateralism. Denying space as a global commons, in a time when the importance of protecting the environment — including in outer space — is matter of survival, is a dangerously anachronistic approach. This perspective encourages the perception of outer space as a “new frontier” to conquer and colonize, which legitimizes the unregulated space race. It harms multilateralism and threatens the preservation of peace and stability in outer space and on Earth. To meet the challenges brought by the Sino-Russian rapprochement in space affairs, an approach that emphasizes more transatlantic coordination and multilateralism is far more likely to succeed than the current unilateral framework embraced by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;katri-pynnöniemi&quot;&gt;Katri Pynnöniemi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of “global hybrid war” is a vision of future global war led by the United States and its allies primarily against Russia, but in a later phase also targeting China. As defined by Alexandr Bartosh, a corresponding member of the Academy of Military Science and the most visible advocate of the hybrid war concept in Russia, the global hybrid war is a protracted, multilevel military conflict between civilizations. The term “hybrid” refers to the simultaneous and coordinated use of military and non-military (e.g., economic, financial, technological, or informational) means of warfare. In general, this type of war is about control of natural resources, spheres of political influence, and competition over technological leadership in the greater Eurasian region, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. In a narrower sense, argues Bartosh, the global hybrid war aims to achieve the “liquidation of the Russian statehood, its disintegration and external control of the country.” In his view, the next targets after Russia will be China and India, the two geopolitical contenders that would remain on the sidelines of the conflict between Russia and the West. Bartosh argues that “Russia and its allies should carefully study global hybrid warfare and develop corresponding offensive and defensive strategies in the interests of ensuring national and international security.” But what does this suggestion for closer cooperation in the hybrid sphere mean in practical terms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The set of questions explored in this article considers China’s role in this arrangement. For example, if the global hybrid war is ultimately a conflict between civilizations, as Bartosh suggests, does this imply a potential conflict between Russia and China as well? Or is this difficult question omitted, and cooperation is legitimized on the basis of traditional great power interests? Recently, Russian scholars have put an emphasis on “mental war” fought against “real” sovereign states, but what role do alliances play in counteracting this type of aggression? Is Russia alone in this struggle, or could China play a role in helping Russia to defend its culture, values, and traditions? An analysis of the material reveals that cooperation with China is framed positively, yet vaguely, leaving many questions still open. Before turning to a more detailed analysis of Sino-Russian cooperation in this area, it is necessary to explore the concept of global hybrid warfare and its place in Russia’s strategic thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-hybrid-war-as-a-code-word-for-the-kremlins-worldview&quot;&gt;The Hybrid War as a Code Word for the Kremlin’s Worldview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the ongoing transformation of Russia’s political environment toward a more authoritarian — even totalitarian — system, it is possible to argue that the concept of global hybrid war has evolved into a “floating signifier” similar to the concept of Marxism-Leninism in the Soviet period. In his work on the history of Soviet cybernetics, Slava Gerovitch shows how Soviet science was flooded with these code words — a kind of newspeak that “blended description with evaluation,” where the meaning of each code word could “shift and change according to context and usage.” However, code words did not acquire their meaning at random; Soviet ideological language had a specific structure whereby certain phenomena or actions were assigned a strong positive or negative value. Cultural theorist Mikhail Epstein conceptualized such words as ideologemes (i.e., a fundamental unit of ideology) that “were not simply words, but concealed judgements that take the form of words.” The Soviet ideological language consisted of three different types of ideologemes (contrastive, conversive, and correlative pairs of words) that, taken together, formed a model of “Soviet Marxist ideolanguage.” The essence of the ideological language, as Epstein shows, was not to exchange information, but to control thinking and action in the Soviet politics. The Soviet regime not only defined the correct use of ideolanguage but also played it against all opponents, and thus acquired full control of the political space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis developed here is that the concept of hybrid war — and other code words related to it — is used like Soviet-era ideologemes to shape perceptions about external and internal threats toward Russia. In this context, it is possible to identify pairs of words that carry positive meaning (denoting what Russia does) and negative meaning (actions by the West).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Soviet ideological language, the meaning of these contemporary word pairs is based not on a specific school of thought but on a combination of political realism (great powers have a right to rule over others), strategic culture (Russia’s imperial legacy and self-perception of exceptionalism), and what one influential analyst deemed the “Barbarossa mentality” (Russia’s traditional fear of encirclement and expectation of decisive surprise attack).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this background, the debate on hybrid warfare offers a context whereby Russian scholars and authorities can elaborate ideas and shape expectations on their country’s future as a “real” sovereign power. It considers Russia’s internal political and economic weaknesses and the assumption that foreign powers are building their capabilities to further weaken Russia. This seems counterintuitive, taking into account Russia’s attempted and successful jailing, repressions, and assassinations of dissenters and its hostile operations against foreign countries. However, in the Russian view, these operations (if they are acknowledged at all) are part of the country’s “active defense” against attempts by foreign powers to subjugate Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Against this background, the debate on hybrid warfare offers a context whereby Russian scholars and authorities can elaborate ideas and shape expectations on their country’s future as a “real” sovereign power.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-the-role-of-china-in-global-hybrid-warfare&quot;&gt;What Is the Role of China in Global Hybrid Warfare?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already indicated, the Russian debate on hybrid war operationalizes the sovereignty-versus-subordination dichotomy and places it in the context of global competition between the United States, China, and Russia. In an article published in 2017, Bartosh underlines how the scale of hybrid warfare encompasses not just particular countries but the entire system of international security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The growing scale of hybrid warfare waged against Russia makes this type of interstate geopolitical confrontation one of the most acute threats to national and international security. Moreover, the use of a complex of hybrid threats as an instrument of external pressure to create instability within the state is no longer just a threat to national security but a powerful destabilizing factor for the entire system of international security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In articles written after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Bartosh argues that “hybrid war is evolving into a ‘multi-dimensional inter-civilizational military conflict,’” which he calls the “global hybrid war.” Here, Bartosh draws from Samuel Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” argumentation when he asserts that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;modern conflicts are moving from the classical linear paradigm to a new type of non-linear wars. The highest form of modern war is “the war of civilizations, that is, the war of the meanings of their existence.” The winner in the war of meanings does not win space or even the right to dispose of the resources of the defeated state, but wins the right to determine its future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Bartosh echoes Russian official parlance that distinguishes between states with “real” sovereignty and states that are only “formally” sovereign — meaning that, in reality, they are proxies of a hegemonic power. Currently, the Kremlin uses this dichotomy primarily to undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty (representing the country as a U.S. proxy). However, it also reveals an important aspect of the Kremlin worldview, according to which only the strong (“real”) states survive. Given Russia’s inherent political instability (e.g., the problem of succession), the Kremlin cannot attain the level of security it expects from “real sovereign” countries. This feeling of weakness might explain its interest in “mental warfare” and “mental security” as a new trend in contemporary warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Bartosh, the two main instruments of the global hybrid war are proxy wars and color revolutions. The term proxy war is mainly used to frame Russia’s war in Ukraine (like any local conflict in Russia’s vicinity) as a conflict between the United States and Russia. Meanwhile, color revolution refers to political instability (e.g., in Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Venezuela) created by external actors that ultimately aims to weaken Russia’s position within its sphere of influence. With this framing, Russia is represented as the victim of hostilities, and the countermeasures it deploys are justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Russian thinkers, China appears in this arrangement as the next potential “target” of the West due to its rising status as a major power. It is also seen as Russia’s strategic partner. Russia’s relations with China are explained with reference to similarities in their “strategic culture,” such as “the general interest of the two powers in defense projects and the prevention of a major military conflict.” This idea is far from claiming any civilizational affinity between the two countries. Instead, Sino-Russian cooperation is framed in terms of national interest and great power competition. Bartosh defines relations between the United States, Russia, and China as an increasingly unstable triangle, formed by three pairs of relations: the U.S.-China and subsequent U.S.-Russia rivalries and the Sino-Russian cooperation framework. Although the West is identified as the main source of instability and chaos due to the United States’ desire to maintain its hegemonic position, Bartosh does not consider Sino-Russian cooperation inevitable. In October 2019, he writes that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;it is unlikely that, in today’s uncertain and chaotic international environment and in the face of its deteriorating relations with the United States, China would be interested in weakening Russia. Rather, on the contrary, an important factor in ensuring the national security of both states should be their mutual interest in each state’s stable and sustainable development. The stakes in the geopolitical confrontation between the three powers are extremely high, and we should not rule out the possibility that the United States may initiate sophisticated maneuvers to split the partnership between Moscow and Beijing. The objective of Russian politicians, diplomats, and the military should be to find a worthy response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, Russia’s cooperation with China is framed as part of “a long-term strategy for a joint struggle” against the West. The affirmation of Sino-Russian partnership by presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping in February 2022 echoes this sentiment and makes the case for increased cooperation in countering interference by outside forces. In 2019 — preceding the joint statement — Bartosh identified counteraction against hybrid aggression “as one of the steps to deepen the relations between China and Russia.” Another Russian scholar, Alexander Isaev, went further in 2018, when he argued that “there has been a serious breakthrough in Russian–Chinese relations.” According to Isaev, this applies especially to thematic dialogues between different government agencies that ultimately “may contribute to the creation in the future of a special platform that would prevent any threat of risks in cyberspace.” The February 2022 joint statement includes many references to increased cooperation within the United Nations and bilaterally in the cyber sphere, which could be interpreted as confirmation of Isaev’s earlier argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in 2017, Bartosh advocated for coordinated counteraction against hybrid threats in the context of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The broad scope of collaboration could include “strengthened cooperation, and coordination in terms of situational awareness, strategic communications, cybersecurity, crisis prevention, and response to counter hybrid threats,” he writes. Bartosh underlines the importance of the cooperation by arguing: “We should submit this as a priority project on adapting the defense capabilities of Russia, the CSTO, the CIS, and the SCO and ensuring response to any hybrid threats against any of the countries or coalitions.” However, he does not develop these ideas further; instead, he calls for the more efficient use of Russia’s internal administrative and intellectual resources. His main concerns seem to be linked to insufficient doctrinal development (e.g., creating a model of hybrid warfare) and problems with inter-agency cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-limits-of-sino-russian-cooperation&quot;&gt;The Limits of Sino-Russian Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Global hybrid war” can be thought of as a code word that has multiple meanings depending on the context. Although it does not carry the weight that “Marxism-Leninism” did in Soviet ideology, certain resemblances to Soviet ideological language help explain how this concept is being used in the current context. The notion of global hybrid war reveals core assumptions regarding global politics and the perception of threats toward Russia’s national interests and security. In other words, it offers a general explanation for recurring tensions and conflicts between Russia and the West, along with the perception of enmity — or even hostility — of Western actors toward Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of China in this arrangement is clear, although few details on possible Sino-Russian cooperation were outlined by the authors of the materials reviewed for this chapter. China is represented as Russia’s strategic partner and the West’s potential “next target.” An interpretation of China as a potential next target places Russia at the center of the ongoing power struggle, thereby upgrading the country’s importance on the global stage. Although Russian authors frame the “global hybrid war” as a conflict between civilizations, they do not elaborate on cultural-strategic similarities between Russia and China, but rather frame the conflict in traditional security and political terms. For example, the concept of strategic culture is defined very broadly, as an attribute of Russia’s (and China’s) alleged defensive posture and the subsequent prioritization of preventing military conflicts (so-called active defense). Counteraction against hybrid threats is listed as one of the potential areas of cooperation between China and Russia. In the material studied for this chapter, the authors identify specific agencies (Ministries of Defense and Military Academies of both countries) and areas (e.g., cyber security or strategic communications) where that cooperation could take place, but they do not elaborate on possible obstacles. The recurring emphasis on improving Russia’s own capabilities in the hybrid sphere can be interpreted as a sign that Russian thinkers have low expectations for what Sino-Russian cooperation can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting detail that might also outline the limits of Sino-Russian cooperation is the emphasis among Russian military scholars on “mental warfare.” The concept of mental warfare carries with it an idea of total war aimed at the complete paralysis of the target country and the destruction of its political and moral will to resist conquest by a foreign power. Consequently, with the subjugation of national culture, values, and traditions, a country’s sovereignty is liquidated, and it becomes a colony or otherwise ceases to exist. In the Russian literature on mental warfare analyzed for this article, it is assumed that each country has its own “core idea”: a set of moral-ethical values and traditions, the destruction of which would lead to the loss of real sovereignty. Advocates of the mental warfare concept call for both preventative actions against presumed Western hostilities (“active defense”) and the securitization of Russia’s domestic sphere — its development in terms of Russian cultural-political traditions. Although this type of development does not exclude cooperation with foreign partners in the technological sphere (e.g., the adaptation of Chinese cyber security models into the Russian context), the center of gravity in mental warfare is Russia’s cultural-political cohesion and its ability to secure its own “real” sovereignty. Thus, it is plausible to suggest that the traditional realist view of state sovereignty also limits Russia’s potential for alliance formation in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-3&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publication of the joint Sino-Russian statement on February 4, 2022, raised the level of the two countries’ commitment to developing bilateral ties. The statement built upon an existing trend of increased cooperation in recent years, which had been further formalized in 2019 during the meeting between Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. The joint statement specifically indicated that Sino-Russian cooperation had now no forbidden areas. Its wording suggested nonetheless that Xi was setting a framework that would first and foremost serve his long-term ambitions for China’s process of rejuvenation. This implies that the scope of cooperation going forward — including in areas such as hybrid and gray zone tactics — is likely to be informed by Chinese ambitions and objectives over Russian ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, cooperation between China and Russia is likely to remain strategic and focused on advancing the two countries’ quest for international relevance, if not primacy as great powers. In particular, while assessments about the underlying strength of the relationship vary, developments in bilateral exercises conducted in 2021 — demonstrating greater Sino-Russian command integration — and the conduct of joint patrol activities, especially in East Asia, confirm that the military relationship is growing closer. In particular, in the Indo-Pacific, Beijing is the senior partner in this evolving relationship. Indeed, very recently China and Russia held their annual joint exercise in the region, and this despite resource-based pressure on Russia deriving from the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. These developments pose two important questions: What do recent changes in Sino-Russian military ties mean for cooperation regarding the use of hybrid and gray zone tactics, and conversely, how will hybrid and gray zone tactics help create opportunities to further advance cooperation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a Chinese perspective, the answer to this line of questioning is significant, and the outcome of the war in Ukraine will inevitably affect it. Much to Chinese surprise, Russian performance in the early stages of the invasion has failed to meet Beijing’s initial expectations. As well-informed foreign observers have noted, for Beijing, Russian military operations in the opening stages of the war were inconsistent with the country’s military doctrine. In particular, the Chinese leadership has likely taken note of Russia’s failure to accurately assess potential Ukrainian opposition, not to mention the lack of adequate preparation in terms of information operations and the wider cognitive dimensions of the war. This, in turn, might lead the Chinese leadership to reconsider whether and to what extent “some limits” to cooperation on hybrid tactics are desirable, if not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the degree of cooperation between Russia and China will be affected by the outcome of the unfolding war, it is nonetheless possible to assess two relevant aspects of this question in the interim. First, it is possible to review how Chinese writers on strategy conceptualize hybrid tactics, and to what extent — if at all — they draw a distinction between hybrid and gray zone operations. Second, it is also possible to assess the extent to which such an understanding creates clear areas of opportunity in terms of cooperation with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hybrid-warfare-and-gray-zones-as-geopolitical-competition&quot;&gt;Hybrid Warfare and Gray Zones as Geopolitical Competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample of Chinese writers surveyed in this project presents “hybrid warfare” and “gray zone” competition as two different, albeit complementary, tools of geopolitical competition among states. In particular, Han Aiyong, an associate professor at the Institute of International Strategic Studies of the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Party School, pointed out that “hybrid warfare is essentially closer to a competitive means by which great powers use indirect, low-intensity conflict to seek geopolitical advantage.” By contrast, the same author suggested that competition in the gray zone focuses more on cognitive forms of conflict, with “psychological warfare, media warfare, legal warfare, economic coercion, and even diplomatic warfare . . . intended to create psychological and physical imbalances by exploiting the internal ills of competitors’ economic and social development, and to create ideological confusion and even social unrest in their favor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this conceptual framework, hybrid and gray zone tactics represent two sides of the same coin. The key difference is that hybrid tactics are designed to address the conduct of limited proxy wars, whereas gray zone tactics oversee the conduct of non-kinetic operations directly against an enemy or competitor. Such preliminary observations come with two caveats, however. First, the notions of “hybrid warfare” and “gray zone” competition are foreign ideas imported into Russian and Chinese strategic thinking, making clear reference to their original development in the United States. Second, both concepts are presented as methods through which great powers engage in competition with each other — and specifically, how the United States engages with competitors such as Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the main body of English-language literature, however, the notions of “hybrid” and “gray zone” forms of competition are used to capture a distinctive set of Russian and Chinese behaviors. For instance, in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) vocabulary, the former term refers to forms of Russian sub-threshold coercive actions drawing upon the integration of different tools of statecraft (e.g., military, diplomatic, economic, as well as information and legal). Insofar as gray zone activities are concerned, English-language literature tends to emphasize how this concept is helpful in specifically identifying Chinese actions that are seemingly designed to remain beneath the threshold of open war. Except for very limited attempts at reconciling this intellectual separation, in the English-language literature, hybrid tactics are the prerogative of the Russian state, while the gray zone is that of China. However, this distinction finds no correlation in the Chinese presentation of these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the Chinese approach to the understanding of “hybrid” and “gray zone” forms of conflict is based on the assumption that international relations are a persistent struggle — in other words, that they are a zero-sum interaction. As a result, Chinese authors regard these methods of competition as desirable — or even necessary — ways to enable the shaping of the international order in a fashion that is favorable to authoritarian regimes like China and Russia. This idea can be clearly inferred by the Chinese claim that the United States and its allies have developed these concepts to undermine strategic competitors in the first place, with specific attention to China and Russia. Thus, China should be able to master and respond to these forms of behavior. In one sense, however, such an intellectual approach, gauging a strong Leninist thinking, implies that China is already “at war” and that hybrid and gray area conflicts are inherent to this state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Chinese scholarship reviewed in this project, hybrid forms of conflict are designed to avoid direct confrontation among major powers. They target strategically important state actors that can either expand or maintain the reach and influence of any major power. In this respect, however, the authors draw a clear distinction about the intent behind the use of hybrid tactics. The intent behind U.S. “hybrid wars” is “offensive” and “globalist,” as the application of these tactics is designed to support and expand the country’s influence at the expense of strategic competitors like China or Russia. Russian hybrid tactics are instead defensive in nature, informed by a more limited aim of preserving Russia’s influence. Relatedly, hybrid wars, because they take actions at the periphery of major power competition, would seem to make low-intensity conflict a reality in the contemporary world. Chinese writers seem to expect low-intensity conflicts to be a component of major power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, from this perspective, a Chinese writer observes that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the competitive logic of hybrid warfare is to create a “controllable” chaos or crisis and then to shape a favorable strategic posture by rebuilding peace and restoring order. This suggests that the ability to respond to major international crises and national governance has become a key element of great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this conceptualization, the Chinese government’s tolerance for conflict is high because it is assumed that it can be kept at acceptable levels. In part, this is acceptable because the core actions are taking place away from a major power’s territory. The same author also added that in a hybrid context, new technologies and “non-contact” forms of competition — notably conflict in digital information spaces, which includes both conflict to disrupt or manipulate network systems and conflict conducted through social media — add to the possibilities and potential of the “controlled chaos” created by hybrid tactics. In other words, these new tools allow for a more integrated and wider-ranging capacity for the conduct of hybrid wars. By the same token, new technologies also increase the likelihood of hybrid tactics being employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray zone competition shares with hybrid tactics a heightened importance of integrating and synergizing different levers of national power. Similarly, both put considerable emphasis on the advantages of non-kinetic tools for the pursuit of competition. On the other hand, gray zone competition also has two features that make it very distinct from hybrid tactics. First, its core focus rests on the creation and management — both in defensive and offensive ways — of plausible legal and political narratives to enable the pursuit of specific courses of action. Indeed, legal narratives are a significant aspect of gray zone competition in that they relate to the advantageous use of established rules and norms to constrain, shape, and sanction behavior in the pursuit of national objectives. Within this context, competition in gray areas is about manipulating and exploiting ambiguities in international frameworks to craft a favorable narrative, while discrediting or undermining those set forth by competitors. From a Chinese perspective, therefore, gray zone conflict would seemingly fall first and foremost within the realm of psychological, political, and legal warfare — a key feature of Chinese strategic thinking about war and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second distinctive aspect of gray area competition concerns the development of political narratives that specifically reinforce — or at least do not undermine — Beijing’s moral standing. In gray zone conflict, the core aim is to gain an advantage by justifying one’s actions. This is not meant solely to paralyze or limit responses to these actions; it is also meant to erode wider support that might be given to one’s competitors. This sheds new light on how Chinese writers view the utility of Beijing’s participation in multilateral institutions: they consider Chinese efforts to increase influence in these organizations as a way to guide the development of the organizations’ internal mechanisms and approaches in ways that favor Beijing’s preferences. This creates another clear distinction between gray zone activities and the objectives behind the mobilization of legal narratives in a “hybrid” conflict. As the same Chinese author remarks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The pursuit of ambiguity in the gray zone is the use of the ambiguous space of rules and the international law system to justify one’s own behavior. Hybrid warfare, on the other hand, is to find a soft restraint on violence by established rules between the regulations of traditional and non-traditional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese authors seem to understand the concept of hybrid tactics as involving competition for influence in states of strategic relevance in a competitive global environment, whereas gray zone competition may focus more directly on the competing powers themselves. Within this context, competition in the gray zone is intended to create psychological and physical imbalances by exploiting the domestic and internal challenges of a major power. The idea is to weaken the competitor from within through political confusion and social unrest. The significance of such a conceptualization of gray zone competition rests also in the inference that, for Chinese authors, this type of competition is actively conducted against China, thus reinforcing their zero-sum understanding of international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resilience-against-destabilization-as-cooperation&quot;&gt;Resilience against Destabilization as Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This intellectual framework suggests that Sino-Russia cooperation in hybrid and gray zone tactics is likely to focus on the double objectives of creating greater resilience at home and maintaining, if not increasing, influence in states of key strategic value overseas. The methods for such cooperation are likely to include a degree of coordination on military activities; yet, new technologies — such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence — and their potential application in shaping public audiences’ perceptions are also likely to become a primary area of Sino-Russian cooperation. Chinese authors, at least, view this type of cooperation as particularly desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This intellectual framework suggests that Sino-Russia cooperation in hybrid and gray zone tactics is likely to focus on the double objectives of creating greater resilience at home and maintaining, if not increasing, influence in states of key strategic value overseas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Chinese authors view the use of social media and information networks as essential to enhance the effect of information dissemination to create favorable international public opinion and to affect the psychological conditions of public audiences in competing countries. These tools can also be very helpful in support of other political, economic, and military means of conflict in the conduct of hybrid wars. Within this context, technology is considered an invaluable tool to reduce gaps between developing and advanced powers — and, crucially, a way to afford precision in the targeting of audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese experts seem keen to prioritize Sino-Russian cooperation to address the risks of political destabilization abroad and at home. In particular, one author focused on the challenge of “color revolutions,” defined as Western-sponsored attempts at destabilizing countries with the ambition to promote regime change. The same author identified states along the periphery of Russia and China as the first targets of a wider attempt at directly undermining Moscow and Beijing. In the Chinese view, purported attempts at regime change in North Africa and Central Asia, as well as presumed Western support for “separatist activities” in places like Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong, reinforce the need for Russia and China to cooperate closely. A perceived increase in the “violence” of these movements — as the case of the 2019 protests in Hong Kong highlights — also adds to such a need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geographically, Sino-Russian cooperation on hybrid and gray zone tactics should focus on enhancing public perceptions of Moscow and Beijing among other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Cooperation should cover political, economic, and cultural aspects, with the aim of strengthening political trust and a perceived sense of friendship. Chinese authors are convinced that dedicated cultural exchange activities that reward cultural differences but reinforce an emotional link to China and Russia should be coordinated with political and economic initiatives. For these Chinese authors, improving public perceptions of Russia and China also includes cultivating ties with elites in CIS and SCO countries. However, they note that strategic competitors like the United States might try to cultivate ties with Russian and Chinese elites in turn, with the aim of undermining the two countries’ governments. As a result, Chinese authors emphasize the need for bilateral cooperation to minimize the risk of domestic corruption. Their solution is to promote cooperation to achieve greater monitoring of domestic elites and senior officials, while also seeking to promote positive incentives to ensure loyalty — or at the very least obedience — to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the realm of military affairs, Chinese scholars view joint exercises as a potential hybrid tool to counter the risk of “color revolutions.” Exercises are not hybrid tactics per se; yet, Chinese authors stress the political value of them as a hybrid tactic. One major example in this context is the joint exercise Unbreakable Brotherhood 2020, conducted at a time of acute instability in Belarus. The exercise was a response to perceived NATO provocations in the country and was intended to both strengthen ties with the regime in Belarus and enhance the cohesiveness within domestic audiences around the importance of supporting the Belarus authorities. Chinese specialists, therefore, regard exercises as potential hybrid tactics insofar as their desired effects are designed to shape, manipulate, and counter Western actions in the Russian and Chinese peripheries. Especially in the context of the SCO, the Chinese aim is to strengthen the combined Sino-Russian capacity for conducting exercises so that they can be used on short notice if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the literature surveyed for this project, governance in cyberspace is another area of prime relevance in Sino-Russian cooperation. In this domain too, Chinese authors perceive a clear sense of challenge mounted by Western power — notably the United States. The Western approach to cyber governance fundamentally undermines the Russian and Chinese approaches to sovereignty in this domain. From their perspective, cooperation should aim at promoting the Sino-Russian view that respect for sovereignty should guide developments in governance. In this context, Sino-Russian cooperation is important for shaping support within multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, and regional organizations such as the SCO, for a specific understanding of governance in cyberspace. Through these organizations, China and Russia can promote mechanisms to safeguard national laws and combat cybercrime as they see fit, while developing shared technical solutions and wider collaboration with other emerging powers to widen their influence. Unsurprisingly, cooperation assumes that in Russia and China private companies and the state work with each other, with business accepting subordination to national authorities in a fashion consistent with the ambitions of the Chinese civil-military fusion doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-hybrid-and-gray-zone-tactics-as-war-by-other-means&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Hybrid and Gray Zone Tactics as War by Other Means?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese scholars envision cooperation with Russia as an inherent part of Beijing’s ascent on the international stage. In a world that is understood to be antagonistic toward China, with the United States perceived as engaging in the use of hybrid and gray zone tactics to destabilize and weaken Russia and China, these tactics are seen as necessary for China to survive and grow as a major power. The Chinese approach to international affairs as a struggle for survival invites three broad conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, notwithstanding conceptual differences, among Chinese scholars both hybrid and gray zone tactics are about asymmetric forms of competition. The intellectual distinction in English-language literature — between hybridity as a form of conduct that pertains to Russia and gray zone as a form of competition relevant to understanding Chinese behavior — is not reflected in the Chinese literature. For them, the key distinction would seem to be that hybrid tactics involve higher levels of tolerance in terms of military engagement and destruction, while gray zone tactics put more stress on non-kinetic means. Further, gray zone tactics are directly applied against an opposing major power, whereas hybrid tactics apply to countries of strategic value in which low-intensity wars are acceptable. For Chinese scholars, gray zone tactics are clearly a priority area of cooperation. They view hybrid tactics, on the other hand, as a space of cooperation specially meant to prevent the loss of influence in areas of strategic significance in the CIS and SCO contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, new technologies and their impact on the structures, perceptions, and political stability of societies are an invaluable addition to the pursuit of asymmetry in hybrid and gray zone tactics. Cyberspace, internet networks, and social media are crucial means to manipulate, destabilize, and weaken other major powers, directly or by seeking to undermine their influence. In this respect, Chinese authors consider the improvement of China’s international image as a key area of gray zone cooperation, together with aggressive actions to politically destabilize competing major powers. Cooperation in developing the means to degrade — and, if necessary, destroy — the physical infrastructure enabling a competing major power’s cyber activities seemingly falls within the category of hybrid tactics. Against this background, the establishment of plausible legal and political narratives as a way to maintain or develop positive perceptions of China and Russia are also more “active” ways to take advantage of these means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Chinese thinking about hybrid and gray zone tactics creates a predisposition for pursuing greater resilience against tactics of a similar nature from being deployed against Beijing and Moscow. For Chinese observers, destabilization and regime change are fundamental risks against which both Russia and China need to shield themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken altogether, these conclusions suggest that, while doubts remain over the extent of Chinese cooperation with Russia after the latter’s invasion of Ukraine, the content and perceived needs of this relationship are understood in similar terms by Moscow and Beijing. In fact, Chinese scholars view the political world as one of struggle — one in which hybrid and gray zone tactics may very well provide an asymmetric edge to tilt the scales of the international order in China’s favor toward a more authoritarian balance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main Conclusions: In the 1990s, Chinese orders ensured the survival of the Russian defense industry (which had suffered from the collapse of the USSR) and preserved its global competitiveness. In turn, after Western sanctions were imposed in 1989, Russia became the main source of advanced weapons for China. Thanks to Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation, China was able to radically transform its armed forces into a modern military machine. The leaders of the Russian military-industrial complex (MIC) understood that the weapons sold to China would eventually be copied. Nevertheless, Moscow exported weapons to China in an effort to preserve the defense industry and earn money to build new-generation weapons systems. The country’s military and political leadership blocked deliveries of the most sensitive systems, which could ensure a rapid breakthrough of the Chinese military-industrial complex and undermine the competitiveness of Russian arms manufacturers. On the whole, this approach turned out to be justified. In the mid-2000s, the supply of weapons from Russia to China noticeably decreased. The reasons were the saturation of the Chinese market, the progress of the military-industrial complex in the PRC itself, and the increased concerns of the Russian leadership about Chinese copying and potential competition in the markets of third countries. Some Russian leaders have expressed fears about the growth of Chinese military capabilities near Russia’s Siberian and far eastern borders. Military-technical cooperation between Russia and China resumed growth in the 2010s, but a major breakthrough occurred in 2014. After the sharp deterioration in relations with the West, the Russian leadership conducted a systematic assessment of the risks of partnership with the PRC, including in the field of military-technical cooperation. Moscow concluded that the risks of cooperation with China were much lower than was commonly believed. The Chinese military industrial complex is less and less dependent on the unlicensed copying of Russian equipment and more and more reliant on its own developments. Fears of “Chinese invasion east of the Urals” have also turned out to be exaggerated. In these circumstances, Moscow has decided to sell such advanced systems as S-400 air defense systems and Su-35 fighter jets. Military-technical cooperation does not play a significant role in the trade between the two countries, accounting for no more than 5 percent of trade turnover. For the Russian military-industrial complex, arms sales to China are no longer a vital necessity, although China remains one of its most important export markets. However, the military-industrial complex plays an important political role, ensuring the strategic depth of the Russian-Chinese partnership. Russia still maintains serious advantages over China in a number of military production sectors. These are the creation of air defense equipment and some types of radar equipment, aircraft engine construction, underwater shipbuilding, and so on. However, in other areas China is now ahead of Russia, especially in the production of unmanned aerial vehicles. Overall, for the Chinese armed forces, buying weapons from Russia is a reliable way to quickly increase their military power (particularly given the possible escalation of conflicts in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and the Taiwan Strait). The Ukrainian crisis, the cessation of Russia’s military cooperation with the West, and Western sanctions against Russian arms manufacturers have increased Moscow’s interest in importing Chinese military technology and equipment. There are isolated examples of the purchase of Chinese military technology for the needs of the Russian Armed Forces, but this phenomenon has not yet become large-scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The crisis around Ukraine, which broke out in early 2014, marked the beginning of a new stage in Russia’s relations with the outside world. In the face of U.S. and EU sanctions, Moscow began to deepen its partnership with China, the largest country that did not publicly condemn Russia for its actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine and did not join the sanctions regime. By that time, the political relations between Moscow and Beijing already had the official status of a strategic partnership, and since 2010, China had become Russia’s largest trading partner after the European Union. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian crisis has raised cooperation between the two largest powers in Eurasia to a new level. One of the most important elements of this partnership was the development and deepening of military-technical cooperation (MTC).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first time, Moscow conducted a comprehensive study of the potential risks that a deeper partnership with China could entail, including in the field of military-technical cooperation. The results of the analysis convinced the Kremlin that the risks of such cooperation had previously been exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the relatively small volume of transactions in monetary terms (about US$3 billion per year), the Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation is of great importance for both sides. Although today Russia’s defense industry is not as dependent on Chinese purchases as it used to be, China remains a major export market for the Russian defense industry, and demand from the PLA has spurred the interest of other buyers. For Beijing, the Russian defense industry is the quickest way to obtain systems that can strengthen the PLA’s advantage at strategic points where military tensions between China and U.S. allies are possible. Finally, cooperation in such a sensitive area as arms serves as an important factor in strengthening the Moscow-Beijing political axis at a time when the parties are not seeking a formal military alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The importance for the Soviet Union of resuming military-technical cooperation with China is demonstrated by the following fact: China, which used to be one of Moscow’s main rivals, was the first foreign buyer of the most advanced Soviet aircraft, while its traditional allies settled for the less advanced MiG-29. The memoirs of Chinese military leaders published in recent years indicate that the Chinese were given fairly broad access to see Soviet military innovations. Moscow even had preliminary talks with Beijing about the possibility of supplying an aircraft carrier and carrier-based aircraft. Apparently, the Soviets assumed that close ties with China would be necessary for successful development after the end of the Cold War, and they were willing to use military technology exports to strengthen relations with Beijing. The Russian Federation thus became only a natural extension of this line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increased military contacts and reduced tensions in border areas contributed to the gradual removal of obstacles to the export of increasingly sophisticated military equipment to China and the transfer of Russian technology there. Opposition to such cooperation on the part of the Russian military gradually weakened in the 1990s. China’s interest in military cooperation with Russia increased sharply in the late 1980s due to China’s restricted access to Western sources of military and dual-use technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The combination of these factors led to the fact that after the collapse of the USSR, the Russian leadership immediately began to create the legal basis and organizational infrastructure for military-technical cooperation with China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An important feature of the military-technical cooperation of Russia and China was the rather strict formal requirements of the Chinese side to the secrecy of transactions, even in cases where the secrecy was clearly meaningless and even absurd. As a result, Russian and Chinese officials often refuse to discuss projects in the field of military-technical cooperation, even when the whole world knows about them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s attitude towards military issues changed radically under the influence of the war in the Persian Gulf (1990–1991), when the United States and its allies defeated and expelled the Iraqi army from Kuwait with minimal losses and in a short period of time. Saddam Hussein’s army of 1990, apart from its rich military experience, was far superior to the PLA in technical equipment. The war demonstrated the growing role of new types of weapons and military equipment, in the development of which China lagged particularly behind: electronic warfare systems, technical reconnaissance, guided weapons, air defense systems, etc. China’s military leadership had to deeply rethink new trends in military affairs and the country’s military construction priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chinese side was well aware of the complexities of the Russian situation. Significant purchases of new weapons for the Russian general-purpose forces were curtailed in 1992–1993 and resumed only after 2008–2009. The Russian military-industrial complex survived on exports, and amid the global decline in military spending in the 1990s, the Chinese and Indian markets were the main targets. Thus, when negotiating with Russia, the Chinese had enormous market power and used it successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first major deals reflected China’s priorities in ensuring its defense capabilities and were primarily related to combat aircraft and aviation weapons. China felt the weakest in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, the story of Russian supplies of Su fighters to China may be viewed as a success. Russia was able to preserve and partly even modernize a critical part of its own military-industrial complex during the difficult period, while the damage caused by the Chinese violation of Russian intellectual property rights was not too great and was limited to the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the evolution of Russia’s foreign policy and deterioration of Russia’s economy in the 1990s have appreciably affected the expansion and deepening of military cooperation with China. The poor state of MIC enterprises forced the managers of specific factories, as well as captains of Russia’s defense industry, to lobby more and more actively for the development of ties with China. The end of optimism about relations with the West that was characteristic of the first years of Russia’s foreign policy is also important.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, the Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation in the 1990s covered almost all areas of arms and military equipment production for general-purpose forces. The result was a frontal rearmament of the entire Chinese military machine, which, with Russian help, made a leap forward by one or two generations of military equipment in most areas. This process was generally ignored in the United States and other Western countries, which assessed the Russian industry too negatively, exaggerating the depth of its decline, and were particularly arrogant of China’s efforts to modernize its military-industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the whole, due to cooperation with Russia, in the 1990s to early 2000s China was able to radically upgrade PLA and receive considerably more modern armed forces which are better suited for combat operations in the twenty-first century. At the same time, military-technical cooperation with Moscow enabled Beijing to significantly enhance the potential of its own military-industrial complex through the purchase of licenses, unlicensed copying of equipment, as well as training by Russian specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the mid-2000s, there was stagnation in Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This situation is explained by a whole complex of reasons affecting China, Russia, and relations between Moscow and Beijing. First of all, for the Russian military-industrial complex, exports to China are no longer a vital necessity. Having retained key defense enterprises in the 1990s, Russia began to plan a largescale rearmament of its own armed forces as early as the mid-2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;he importance of the Chinese market for the domestic military-industrial complex was declining not only due to the growth of effective demand for Russian military equipment on the part of the Russian Armed Forces; it was also facilitated by the diversification of arms exports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, rising hydrocarbon prices and a significant inflow of petrodollars into the Russian treasury provided Moscow with additional financial resources. The state had no trouble covering its social obligations and expanding them with the help of oil and gas revenues. It was now possible to be more selective about other sources of income, including arms exports to China. In addition, the role of military-technical cooperation for the stability of relations between Moscow and Beijing, which had been one of the pillars of the Russia-China partnership in the 1990s, began to diminish.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amid the rapid growth of mutual trade, the share of military-technical cooperation in its structure was decreasing, making arms trade one of the many elements of cooperation rather than the basis of bilateral economic relations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moscow has paid much more attention to risk analysis. The Russian side was increasingly concerned, first, about the problem of the scale of unlicensed copying of the equipment received from Russia, and second, about the potential of future competition from the Chinese military-industrial complex in the newly acquired markets, especially in North Africa and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the final resolution of the border issue with China in 2004–2006, the Russian leadership rekindled discussions on the possibility of Chinese economic, demographic and, in the distant future, military expansion into the sparsely populated contiguous areas of the Russian Far East and Eastern Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The potential connection between the restriction of export of advanced weapons systems to China and Moscow’s concern over the PLA’s intentions is also confirmed by the informal statements of the leaders of the Russian military industrial complex. These discussions apparently resulted in the decision not to rush to sell to China the latest systems, like S-400 air defense systems or Su-35 fighters, but to insist on the most favorable (and not necessarily acceptable to China) terms. The absence of a deal at that time was better than a deal that did not satisfy Moscow’s growing demands for bilateral military-technical cooperation. In China, there was also a complex of reasons that, in the middle and second half of the 2000s, temporarily reduced Beijing’s interest in purchasing Russian equipment. After the programs of licensed production of Su-27SK fighters ended in 2003–2004 and the main supplies of Su-30MKK fighters ended, China began to gradually reduce the import of Russian weapons. This was the result of the increased self-confidence of the captains of the Chinese military-industrial complex, who made obviously unrealistic promises to their leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A gradual recovery in the volume of military-technical cooperation was recorded in the early 2010s, when the Chinese side was forced to admit the limited capabilities of its industry and its dependence on Russia for some critical components. Moscow also became more optimistic about the prospects for profitable cooperation with China, partly as a result of the economic crisis, which once again raised the issue of diversifying the sources of budget revenues. However, the Ukrainian crisis of 2014 had a decisive influence on the deepening of Russia-China military-technical cooperation at the present stage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was the Ukrainian events that accelerated Russia’s “pivot to the East”: after the introduction of sanctions, Moscow began to intensively search for opportunities to increase ties with its Asian partners in order to compensate for the reduced volume of loans and investments due to sanctions, as well as to provide access to technology. The only obvious candidate for the role of a “friend in need” was Beijing. China was the only major economy that did not impose sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognizing the need to strengthen its partnership with China, in the spring of 2014 various Russian agencies analyzed the potential risks of cooperation with China. Before rushing to embrace Beijing, Moscow wanted to understand the limits of the giant neighbor’s safe participation in the Russian economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In particular, the analysis of the situation with the Chinese presence beyond the Urals showed that Russia should not be afraid of China’s “creeping demographic expansion” into vacant territories.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moscow has come to the conclusion that the perceptions in the Russian media, the expert community, and some of the authorities about the dangers of Chinese migration to the Russian Far East proved to be overly alarmist, and that the scenario of the future “annexation” of Russian territories by China according to the “Crimean scenario” was completely unrealistic. In addition, the Russian leadership has gained a more adequate understanding of the internal transformation of the Chinese economy: the aging population, a shrinking workforce, and a policy to reduce the consumption of natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly aware of the problems that Chinese arms manufacturers face and will face, Moscow came to the conclusion that in the long term China will become less dependent on the Russian military industry and that, as the Chinese defense industry develops without Russian participation through direct sales of equipment, transfer of licenses and possibly joint arms development, in the future Russian opportunities to make money in the Chinese arms market will become increasingly limited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This change in approach was evidenced by a program interview with Rosoboronexport CEO Anatoly Isaikin in April 2015 in the Kommersant newspaper, in which, among other things, the contract for the sale of S-400 air defense systems to China was announced. In response to a reporter’s question about whether Russian enterprises are not afraid to enter into cooperation with PRC enterprises, Isaikin replied: “I believe that if we work in China’s interests, we also work in our own interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result of this analysis, Moscow’s attitude to the development of military cooperation with China has changed to a more open one. Selling advanced weapons to China became part of the strategy of rapprochement with Beijing in response to the systemic crisis in relations with the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moscow agreed to more actively help China build up its military power and capabilities in light of the PLA’s tasks in the Pacific (of course, not disinterestedly), expecting in return that China would help Russia more easily survive the most acute period of confrontation with the West through investments and loans, as well as the necessary technology (also not for free). On the whole, this approach worked. Of course, China did not help Russia on a large scale for a whole complex of reasons, among them the consequences of the anti-corruption campaign in China, which paralyzed the decision-making process at many state enterprises; the drop in commodity prices; and the slowdown of the Chinese economy itself. In addition, PRC companies operating in global markets have been attentive to Western sanctions. However, despite this, Beijing has made several important investments in projects prioritized by Russian president Vladimir Putin, as well as providing a number of Russian companies with access to cheap financing. The most significant symbolic gesture of support from Beijing was the participation of Chinese companies in the construction of a power bridge to Crimea, despite Western sanctions. In the field of military-technical cooperation, major shifts took place in the fall of 2014, shortly after the U.S. and EU sectoral sanctions came into effect. Moscow and Beijing completed years of negotiations on the supply of four divisions of Russia’s latest S-400 air defense system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, the volume of military goods and services sold to China in 2016 exceeded USD $3 billion, and the total portfolio of Chinese orders is about USD $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having made serious progress in independent development and system integration of complex equipment, the Chinese continue to suffer from disproportionate development of various components of their huge military industrial complex and lag behind many suppliers of critical materials and components. Russia fills these gaps by carrying out both relevant R&amp;amp;D and supply in China’s interests. Today, cooperation is primarily not a small number of large arms supply contracts, but dozens or hundreds of small agreements, hardly identifiable by the media. The Ukrainian crisis, the cessation of Russia’s military cooperation with the West, and sanctions against Russian arms manufacturers have led not only to an increase in Russian arms supplies to China, but also to an increase in Russian interest in imports of Chinese technology and military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some areas of military equipment production, China is already ahead of Russia. Unmanned aerial vehicles are a typical example.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on the results of two years after the Ukrainian crisis, we can say that the deepening of military-technical cooperation between Russia and China is evident. This is evidenced not only by structural shifts in cooperation, but also by its increased volume.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia retains serious advantages over China in many areas of military production due to significant state investments, which have resumed since the late 2000s. This is true of air defense equipment, aircraft engines, a number of types of radar technology, submarine shipbuilding, and so on. However, there are also areas where Russia has begun to lag behind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The S-400 air defense systems and Su-35 fighters sold by Moscow could in the future significantly enhance the PLA’s combat capabilities in critical areas in the Pacific, where China increasingly needs to demonstrate its deterrence capability against the United States and its allies, or where there is a risk of limited military confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The task of curtailing Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation is impossible; the United States and Japan can only try to correct the course of the Russian Federation, inducing Russia to refuse to expand cooperation to other sensitive areas like space technology or missile warning systems. However, given the recent tightening of anti-Russian sanctions by the U.S. Congress, the opportunities for Washington and Tokyo to play in this field are limited, and therefore they can only closely monitor the development of military-technical cooperation between Moscow and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruslan Polonchuk, “Товарищество пока на доверии: Военно-техническое сотрудничество России и Китая требует совершенствования” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://vpk-news.ru/articles/60886&quot;&gt;A Partnership Based on Trust So Far: Military-technical cooperation between Russia and China needs improvement, Военно-промышленный Kурьер Military-Industrial Courier, February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An analysis of Chinese military and technical publications shows that Beijing positively evaluates the opportunities for a progressive increase in bilateral military-technical cooperation in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, in practice Beijing is striving to gradually abandon the purchase of large quantities of Russian arms and military equipment and to transfer bilateral military-technical cooperation to a qualitatively new level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, China’s leadership officially has no doubts about the importance of further deepening military-technical cooperation with Russia. At the same time, as Russia’s economic potential grows in the long term, contradictions may arise in Russian-Chinese relations due to the mutual desire to expand their spheres of interests in the Asia-Pacific region and in Central Asia. Such a scenario could lead China to contain Russia, including in the field of military-technical cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Russia faces a difficult choice: provide China with advanced technologies, realizing that they are likely to be copied, or refuse to sell weapons, knowing that Chinese defense industry enterprises will develop comparable systems on their own in the near future. The former strategy of Russian arms exports, which consisted of selling “secondary” technologies, is no longer viable. China’s military industry has sufficiently caught up with Russia’s, so now the Chinese are interested only in the most modern weapons we have.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems expedient to further diversify Russian-Chinese military-technical cooperation and supplement it with the joint development of technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The growing maturity of Sino-Russian state relations and the deepening of political mutual trust between the two countries provide the political prerequisites for carrying out military cooperation. China’s growing economic strength and urgent need for defense modernization, as well as Russia’s still strong military and technological capabilities, provide the practical requirements and technical prerequisites for bilateral military cooperation, allowing both countries to complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses. In addition, the similarity of their military establishments provides facilitative conditions for military cooperation between the two countries. In the current international security situation, both countries face security pressures to deal with various traditional and nontraditional threats, and they have common interests in opposing hegemony, maintaining world and regional peace, combating the “three evils,” and safeguarding their national interests. This pursuit of security in turn provides internal momentum for the deepening of military cooperation between China and Russia, giving it long-lasting vitality and impetus. On this foundation, China and Russia have now formed a “three-in-one” — military-political, military-technical, and military-operational — military cooperation relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the arms embargo imposed on China by the European Union and the United States, Russia has now become China’s most important source of advanced military equipment, and as a result, China has also become the second-largest export destination of Russian weapons after India. According to Russian media estimates, arms exports to China account for an average of 20 percent of Russia’s total exports, and in individual years account for 40 to 50 percent of all Russian arms exports. To ensure that military-technical cooperation goes smoothly, China and Russia have established the Intergovernmental Commission on Military-Technical Cooperation, which meets annually in the two countries on a rotating basis. Currently, China-Russia military-technical cooperation is focused on China’s purchase of modern warplanes, ships, new land equipment, and air and missile defense weapons from the Russian side. According to public reports in Russian and Chinese media, China has become the world’s largest user of the Su series of combat aircraft. Between 1990 and 2005, Russia sold China nearly 200 combat aircraft of various types, 12 battalions of C-300 anti-aircraft missiles, a number of Tor missile systems, four Hyundai-class destroyers, and 12 Sovremenny-class destroyers. China was the largest importer of Russian weapons until 2006, when India replaced it. According to the Russian newspaper Red Star, the two sides signed a USD $5 billion arms contract in September 2005, under which Russia would supply, over a three-year period, Su-30MKK multi-purpose fighters, Kilo 636 diesel-electric submarines, 956 and modified 956 Sovremenny-class destroyers, and S-300PMU air defense missile systems. More importantly, China has purchased production licenses for Su series fighters, flamethrowers, and other military products. In addition, China and Russia have cooperated in the aerospace field, jointly carrying out scientific research and experimental design work. Recently, the two countries’ defense ministries have been negotiating the export of Russian Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 air defense missiles to China. Since 2014, with the intensification of Western economic sanctions against Russia, Sino-Russian military cooperation has become increasingly complementary, ushering in a “golden age” of China-Russia military-technical cooperation. On November 26, 2015, at a regular press conference of China’s Ministry of Defense, spokesperson Wu Qian said that China and Russia had achieved “milestones” in cooperation projects for Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 anti-missile systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an important component of the Sino-Russian strategic partnership of coordination, China Russia military cooperation will maintain strong development momentum for a considerable time to come. From China’s point of view, learning from others and introducing and drawing on relatively mature foreign military-technological achievements can, in a relatively short amount of time, raise China’s level of defense modernization, especially naval and air force weapons modernization, effectively curb hegemonism and power politics, reduce the security pressures it faces, and prevent the infiltration of international terrorist forces. As a country that both possesses relatively advanced military technology and weapons and enjoys the right to sell and transfer military technology on its own, Russia has naturally become China’s first choice for military cooperation. From Russia’s point of view, strengthening cooperation with China in the military field is also of strategic importance. Facing serious threats on its western and southern fronts, Russia is bound to seek strategic mutual trust between Russia and China and strengthen China-Russia military cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the level of mutual trust between China and Russia continues to rise, China-Russia military-technical cooperation is moving to the highest stage — joint development of high-tech weapons and equipment — and Russia has even begun buying military products from the Chinese side. China has now started to provide the Russian side electronic components for aerospace, diesel engines for ships, and seaborne supply systems for ocean-going supply ships. [Additionally,] the subject of cooperation will be more sensitive. This is reflected in China and Russia sending their most advanced technical equipment to participate in the “Peace Mission” and “Joint Sea” joint military exercises, as well as in the continuous development of China-Russia military-technical cooperation toward the field of key and sophisticated weapons, especially in the increasingly strong trend toward joint development of modern equipment. Examples include cooperation in nuclear submarine design and manufacturing, space, and missile attack warning. In short, China-Russia military cooperation will be higher-level, deeper in content, and more profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It cannot be denied that some problems still exist in the field of China-Russia military cooperation. The first is that mutual trust between the two sides remains insufficient. In Russia, some people who start out from a Cold War “China threat” mentality maintain that military cooperation with China, especially military-technical cooperation, will have a negative impact on Russia’s long-term security, and that Russia should “hold back a few tricks” from China. Some people in China, on the other hand, voice dissatisfaction with the obvious disparity in the sale of weapons and equipment to China and India, maintaining that this runs counter to the China-Russia strategic partnership of coordination. The second is that improvement is still needed in the specific modalities of military-technical cooperation. For a long time, China-Russia military-technical cooperation has mainly been a buyer-seller relationship with China buying and Russia selling. China hopes to change this kind of cooperative relationship dominated by buying and selling into one of technology exchange and cooperation, with joint research and development and mutual benefits, in order to effectively raise the level of China’s military modernization equipment and maintain national security. Russia, for its part, has frequently criticized China’s imitation of Russian-made weapons. Since 2000, along with the rapid advancement of China’s military technology, its advanced weapons development capabilities have grown increasingly strong. Breakthroughs have been achieved in some fields and key technologies, and the defense industry is now able to meet the nation’s needs for weapons and equipment updating, upgrading, and modernization. Therefore, in the field of military-technical cooperation, there will be a greater shift toward purchasing key technologies and sophisticated weaponry, and the emergence of a new situation in which China even exports equipment to Russia is not to be ruled out. The third problem is that a competitive relationship between China and Russia will form in the arms export market in the future. As Chinese-made weapons continue to go global and the two countries’ weapons and equipment become more “homogeneous” in terms of design concepts, use characteristics, and prices, Russia fears that China will crowd out Russian weapons from the market, thus affecting Russian exports of advanced military technology to China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the history of Sino-Soviet relations, the disparity in power between the two militaries objectively caused an asymmetry in bilateral relations and an imbalance in military cooperation, while the Soviet Union’s deep-rooted chauvinism led it to regard itself as the major party and the major power, positioning military cooperation between the two sides as a relationship of guiding and being guided, giving and receiving, repeatedly disrespecting the interests of the other side and imposing itself on others, threatening to cancel military aid at every turn, and seriously hurting the feelings of the Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “extended family” style of military cooperation relationship that draws ideological boundaries and transcends normal national interests is doomed to be short-lived and will eventually harm the relationship between the two countries due to its high degree of political sensitivity. The fundamental reason why China and the Soviet Union turned from alliance to confrontation in the 1950s and 1960s was the dislocation between ideology and actual national interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current military cooperation between China and Russia is subordinate to and serves the modernization of the Chinese military, creating a safe surrounding environment for defending national interests during a time of important strategic opportunity, but it also conforms to Russia’s strategic need to stabilize its neighborhood and ensure the global balance of strategic power, as well as the idea of using arms sales to drive economic development. Consequently, military cooperation will become an important factor in promoting the healthy development of bilateral relations and maintaining regional and world stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proves that placing the emphasis on foreign technical assistance or the purchase of foreign weapons inevitably results in the dependence of China’s national defense undertakings. Fundamentally enhancing military strength, on the other hand, requires instead the selective and focused introduction of key foreign equipment and technologies while adhering to self-reliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

Military-Industrial Courier, September 30, 2019&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September, the deputy chairman of the Central Military Committee of the PRC, Zhang Yuxia, and Russian minister of defense, Sergei Shoigu, signed an agreement on the further strengthening of cooperation. According to information from the Committee of the Federation Council on the defense and security of the Russian Federation, the agreement may include the exchange of technology and the Chinese use of elements of the Russian Federation’s anti-aircraft defense systems in the Far East, which testifies to a high level of mutual trust. In the White Book of defense published by Beijing on July 24, it is written that military cooperation with Russia has developed to a high level and plays a significant role in supporting global strategic stability. It is also highlighted that military cooperation is not directed against any third party and will include air, land, and sea forces. Beginning in 2012, officers in both armies have conducted eight rounds of strategic consultations. In 2017, Russia and China organized their first collective naval maneuvers in the Baltic Sea. In 2018, a formation of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army participated in the “Vostok” strategic exercises. In April–May of the same year “Naval Interaction (Joint Sea)” took place in the region of Qingdao.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On July 23, the Russian and Chinese Air forces carried out their first cooperation air patrol with long range aircraft over the water around Japan and the East China Sea, eliciting an unpleasant reaction from military allies of the United States in the Far East and in other regions of the world. Western experts viewed these actions not as just a regular routine exercise, but as a kind of demonstration of Russian and Chinese readiness for further military collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on official statements by China’s top leaders, they adhere to a policy of non-alignment, exclude military alliances with anyone, oppose the use of force, and favor a peaceful resolution of disputed issues. So, presenting to the members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the PRC and high-ranking officials with a speech on the country’s foreign politics, Xi Jinping declared that China would not enter a military block with Russia or any other country. This would tie Beijing’s hands. China would expand its influence in the world and form a network of allies on all continents through soft power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A military alliance between two such powerful countries would change the entire strategic position of the world. This disturbance is caused not only by the above-mentioned actions in the military and military-technical spheres, but by the fact that the two countries hold identical or similar positions in the majority of international problems and demonstrate them collectively on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These and certain other factors provide a context for the development of mutually beneficial relations between these countries in the interest of mutual opposition to the threats and challenges of modernity and the strengthening of the world order. The question of a military alliance is evidently not entirely imaginary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, conversations on the creation of an official military-political union are premature. This is entirely understandable. Such unions, not to mention states, are not historically threatening to anyone, conducted only in anticipation of extreme circumstances, and created with defense in mind. In other words, the activities of Moscow and Beijing in this sphere will depend largely on the activities of the West and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruslan Polonchuk, “Военное сотрудничество России и Китая” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=44888630&quot;&gt;Russia and China’s Military Cooperation, Ethnosocium and Multinational Society 1 (2021): 95–105&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2015–2020, Russia and China continued their military-technical policy. Russia and China continued meetings between top military officials. At the same time, the focus of cooperation between Moscow and Beijing was distinctly “anti-American.” One of the most important areas of military cooperation during this period was joint Russian-Chinese military exercises. Strategic command and staff exercises (SSCE) were held regularly from 2015 to 2020. One of the most ambitious maneuvers was “Vostok-2018,” with the participation of Chinese servicemen. The SSCE was organized under the personal leadership of Russian defense minister Army General S.K. Shoigu. At five ranges and water areas in the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan, and the Bering Sea, 300,000 servicemen, more than 1,000 aircraft, 36,000 tanks, and up to 80 ships and support vessels participated. According to the Defense Ministry of China, China sent about 1,600 soldiers, more than 300 vehicles, and 30 aircraft and helicopters for the exercise “Vostok-2018,” and then the same the following year for “Center-2019” as well. About 100 servicemen of the PLA and 18 vehicles were involved in the “Caucasus 2020” SSCE. The naval exercises known as “Maritime Cooperation” are planned and coordinated by the PLA Command with the specific political tasks facing the PRC in mind. Joint naval maneuvers have been held annually since 2015 in the South China Sea and the Baltic Sea. According to PLA commanders, the varied geography of the exercises is a way to mark the growing military power of the two countries. The Chinese and Russian navies have also been involved in the exercises. In December 2019, China, Russia, and Iran jointly conducted a three-day naval exercise in the Gulf of Oman. The maneuvers were held to demonstrate a high level of coordination of joint maritime activities amid escalating tensions between the United States and Iran. The naval exercises were aimed at two main tasks: to demonstrate the increased capabilities of the PLA to combat traditional and non-traditional threats and to obtain information on the training methods and specifics of the Russian Navy. Anti-terrorist exercises have become a topical area for strengthening military ties with Russia in the fight against international terrorism, separatism, and religious extremism, both on a bilateral basis and within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The anti-terrorist exercise “Peace Mission” of the Armed Forces of the SCO member countries has received considerable attention. According to Chinese commanders, this exercise has a stabilizing effect on the regional situation and prepares the country’s armed forces for counterterrorist actions in the territory of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In October 2019, Novosibirsk Oblast hosted the “Cooperation-2019” exercise of anti-terrorist units of the Russian Federal Guard Service and People’s Armed Militia of the People’s Republic of China, where joint actions against international terrorist groups were practiced. The peculiarity of anti-terrorist exercises of Russia and China is that they practiced interaction between battalion-tactical groups, while Sino-Pakistani and Sino-Thai exercises of similar orientation involve units of marines and PLA Airborne Forces numbering from 150 to 250 servicemen. Joint air patrols in the Asia-Pacific region by Chinese and Russian bombers are becoming a new tool for achieving long-term political goals in the region. At the end of December 2020, the Russian Air Force and PLA Air Force conducted the second joint air patrol by long-range aircraft. The air group, consisting of two strategic bombers TU-95 MS (Russia) and four H-6K (PRC), carried out air patrols over the waters of the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. During the patrols, the aviation strictly adhered to international law without violating the airspace of foreign states. The computer-based missile defense (BMD) “Aerospace Security” exercise is seen by the Chinese leadership as a response to the U.S. deployment of the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea. According to Beijing, their main purpose is to demonstrate to regional rivals the high level of relations with Russia. The peculiarity of the Russian-Chinese exercises, which began in 2017, is the use of computer simulations of the missile defense system of the two countries. Let’s specify that the work in real conditions is not possible because of the high level of secrecy and prohibition of access to the facilities of the national missile defense systems. Engineering and design problems at this stage make it impossible for Chinese engineers to develop their own missile defense system, which is confirmed by the unrelenting interest of Chinese specialists in Russian S-400 and S-500 systems, which could eventually form the basis of a Chinese missile defense system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for Russian-Chinese military-political cooperation, we should note the multi-vector orientation of the ongoing military exercises. In accordance with the requirements of modern military art, it seems advisable to continue to conduct joint maneuvers of motorized infantry units, which would help military personnel to master the skills of combat in urban areas. At the same time, it would be most appropriate to conduct them at PRC ranges, in order to get acquainted in practice with the pros and cons of the theater command system created in 2016 in the PRC according to the U.S. model. Given the rapid development of PLA naval forces, it is possible to organize Russian-Chinese naval patrols to jointly carry out flag demonstration tasks in peacetime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vasiliy Kashin and Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, “Совместная оборона. Против кого дружат военные России и Китая” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://ria.ru/20210705/oborona-1739958628.html&quot;&gt;Joint Defense. Russian and Chinese militaries are friends against whom?, RIA Novosti, July 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Military experts emphasize that although the possibility of a military conflict with NATO countries is extremely unlikely, it exists. Therefore, neighboring states need to work out the reflection of potential aggression. “Any such maneuvers are designed to work out the real situation. We have to watch the reaction of the West, especially the Pentagon, but not bow our heads to them and ask their permission,” says Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, former head of the Main Directorate for International Military Cooperation of the Defense Ministry. In the early 2000s, the joint exercises were declared to be anti-terrorist, but now they have taken on a high-tech, advanced nature, Vasily Kashin, director of the Centre for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, reminded. “Obviously, they are aimed at transferring experience and increasing interoperability when confronting a major foreign adversary, which can only be the United States,” he believes. In this sense, Moscow and Beijing are certainly pushing back on the American factor, but it is not the only one. “There is, for example, a factor of concern about stability in Central Asia and the desire to maintain military ties to ensure transparency of mutual trust in defense. In addition, in the course of exercises and exchange of delegations, our and Chinese military get a huge amount of knowledge about each other, and, unlike the United States, our Ministry of Defense does not publish its assessments of Chinese military power. However, they stand high on the level of awareness thanks to such wide connections, it allows them to feel confident, separate myths from reality, understand what capabilities they are actually developing,” the expert adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexander Yermakov, “Учения и интеграция военных групп: Как Россия и Китай готовятся к защите от НАТО” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://eurasia.expert/kak-rossiya-i-kitay-gotovyatsya-k-zashchite-ot-nato&quot;&gt;Exercises and Military Group Integration: How Russia and China Prepare to Defend Against NATO, Eurasia Expert, October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Russo-Chinese military drill “Zapad/Interaction-2021,” held in the Ninxia Hui Autonomous Region in the northern part of the PRC, showed a definitively new stage in the cooperative military preparations for both nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, Russian soldiers underwent an express course in the use of new Chinese wheeled armored cars: the heavy wheeled infantry ZBL-08 and the ZTL-11 mobile assault gun (in the Chinese classification — the contemporary Western convention refers to them as “Wheeled Tanks.”) Both are comparatively new machines without direct Russian or Soviet predecessors, which would make their introduction especially useful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the present moment, the Russian army has no contemporary armored vehicles, let alone a unified family as the moment demands. The BTR-80/82 is a vehicle with roots in the Cold War, with entirely different goals. This situation should soon begin to change: following a drill in the beginning of the Army-2021 exhibition, the development of the Bumerang family of armored vehicles was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, from a political and educational point of view, the most important thing in these drills was achieving a new level of integration in these countries’ military action. A cooperation staff was formed which guided the activity of soldiers through a single guiding information system. Following orders passed through this system, Russian paratroopers and Chinese servicemen carried out landings from Chinese helicopters (admittedly Russian-produced) and seized important objectives held by hypothetical “terrorists”, and the Russian SU-30SM enacted practice bombing runs on orders from the Chinese military.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naturally both parties are far from being involved in a military alliance, and they are not working towards one: despite the best attempts of both sides of the Russo-Chinese friendship, the U.S. State Department does not hold the most benevolent policy towards these countries. However the increasingly frequent and complex military drills by both countries, such as the one described here (and for China, this is the first drill with foreign soldiers since the beginning of the pandemic), testifies to the intention of these parties to demonstrate that there is no chance of realizing the fantasies of a gang of analysts from the 1990s about an “inescapable conflict” or “the impossibility of close integration because of their fundamental distrust for one another.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“中俄联演 — 演习有何亮点看点？军事专家为你深入解读” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.thepaper.cn/baijiahao_13973728&quot;&gt;Sino-Russian joint exercise — What are the highlights of the exercise? Military experts give you an in-depth interpretation, The Paper, August 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the highlights of the Zapad/Interaction-2021 military exercise? How will the Chinese and Russian military forces carry out joint combat operations? China Media Group reporter Wang Ruitao held an exclusive interview at Qintongxia Contract Tactical Training Base with Li Shuyin, a researcher at the Academy of Military Sciences and expert on Russian military affairs, who was observing the military exercise on site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qingtongxia Training Base is located in the foothills of the Helan Mountains in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The terrain consists mainly of the Gobi Desert and hilly ground, with an elevation variation that is largely within 30 meters. It could be described as gentle slopes and level ground. It is a training base representative of combat in Gobi Desert and cold plateau conditions. It is suitable for simulating land where terrorists hide and operate. The climate here is similar to Central Asia; both are dry, with little rain. This makes this base highly suitable for training for desert and plateau combat operations such as anti-terrorist operations and special operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with the Peace Mission exercise held by China and Russia in 2005, there have been 16 years of exercises held under the Sino-Russian bilateral framework. The current one, I feel, differs from previous exercises such as the Peace Mission and Joint Sea exercises, in the following areas. First, a change in roles. Instead of a Russian-led strategic exercise which to participate in them Chinese army had to leave Chinese territory, it is an exercise led by China on Chinese territory. The main objective of this exercise is to demonstrate the joint combat characteristics of the Chinese military, particularly the improvements to the joint combat capabilities of our military forces since the national defense and military force reforms. At the same time, this is an effort to create a joint exercise “brand” mainly focused on our military. Second, a change in approach. In previous joint exercises, the Chinese and Russian sides would plan independently and organize independent groups under the same combat plan, largely demonstrating the relatively independent operations of each side under a single combat plan and in the same battlefield environment. This joint exercise, in contrast, has achieved combined planning, mixed formations, and joint training. Third, changes in content. From the perspective of training subjects, there is more joint content, and it is more practical. It presents systemic qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Unity” has always been a keyword in Sino-Russian joint exercises. By performing a comparative analysis vis-à-vis the previous few exercises, we can see that there has been further improvement in the level of unity in this exercise. I feel that the way to measure the level of unity in the two countries’ joint exercises is to look at their planning and command. In this exercise, a term that we often use is “combined planning.” First of all, a Russian military command branch center was established under joint command, and we developed a unified, Chinese-Russian bilingual joint information system. By building a Chinese-Russian joint command information system, we can more effectively achieve video and data links and communication with the Russian army, allowing us to share data and situation information, while unifying combat rules and laying a good foundation for joint operations by the two armies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This training content enables us to experience the improvement in Chinese military training skills and the new breakthroughs in warfare. There have also been new breakthroughs in joint command combat capabilities. By relying on network information systems, the participating officers and soldiers build command links that operate more smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, this exercise amply embodies the high level of friendly Sino-Russian cooperation and embodies friendship and trust between the two militaries, unconstrained by time or place and unaffected by the pandemic. We know that this exercise was held against a background of a coronavirus pandemic that is continuing to spread and that is becoming more complex. There are many major activities that have been delayed or canceled — yet normalized, institutionalized Sino-Russian joint exercises not only have not been interrupted but are still continuously undergoing quality improvements and innovations. This demonstrates that the comprehensive Sino-Russian strategic collaborative partnership and the friendly relationship between the two militaries are continuously ascending to higher stages. In addition, this exercise demonstrates to the whole world the firm resolve of the Chinese and Russian militaries to uphold world peace and regional stability. China and Russia have always worked together to construct a fairer, more reasonable international order. As responsible powers, China and Russia are demonstrating to the world their resolve to continue to be defenders and upholders of regional peace and stability, while also providing a fright to those terroristic forces that wait for opportunities to manufacture terror incidents and disturb regional stability — and to the supporters behind such forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jian Feng, “‘营战斗群战术’与中俄军演” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTOTAL-TKZJ202117006.htm&quot;&gt;‘Battalion Battle Group Tactics’ and Russian-Chinese Military Exercises, Tanks and Armored Vehicles, September 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military cooperation, including military exercises, is an important part of state relations and is the easiest way for outsiders to observe whether two countries are “allies.” From the participation of the J-20 to the amazingly open weapons interoperability, the concluded China-Russia Zapad/Interaction-2021 strategic exercise presented many new points, highlighting the orderly and in-depth military cooperation between China and Russia in the new era and conveying to the outside world in a highly complex form that “China and Russia are not allies but are better than allies.” However, while the strategic significance of this high-level joint military exercise has been the subject of numerous analytical articles in various media, there are very few voices interpreting it from a purely military operational perspective. In fact, this joint Chinese-Russian military exercise was highly practical. The exercises included joint planning, joint operational synergy, long-range delivery capabilities and military firepower strikes, and integrated joint command systems and joint logistical support capabilities. In particular, the two armies exhibited a greater degree of pragmatism in their participation in each other’s strategic exercises, where they were mixed and where they planned together to test the capabilities of troop reconnaissance, early warnings, and electronic information attacks. This article is a detailed review of the “dry goods” of the Chinese-Russian military exercise, using “battalion tactical group (BTG) tactics” as the starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in addition to the United States and China, the Russian military is also exploring the construction of similar “synthetic battalions” and is likely to be carrying out battlefield practice in such places as Syria and eastern Ukraine. These practical experiences will be invaluable to the PLA in exploring the tactical use of synthetic battalions and making further adjustments to their construction. Although Chinese forces were invited to participate in Russia’s East 2018, Central 2019, and Caucasus 2020 strategic exercises, this indicates that the cooperation between Russian and Chinese armies in the field of joint exercises has entered a new stage and reached a new level. It also means that the PLA will enter a new level of understanding of Russian “BTG tactics.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tactics of Russian BTGs, which have been refined on the battlefield, are not only evident in past Chinese-Russian joint military exercises but also in some unusual changes in the China-Russia Joint Western 2021 strategic exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, the China-Russia Joint Western 2021 strategic exercise can be considered, to some extent, as “an experiment in supporting three to four battalion-sized tactical groups with tactical-level fire support and security forces in a high-intensity but limited-purpose battlefield confrontation.” The relevance of this model is precisely that these are the shortcomings of Russian BTG tactics that have been revealed in actual combat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although these new BTGs have demonstrated a relatively high level of combat capability during their involvement in Ukraine and Syria and have changed the stereotypical and conservative image of the Russian military, they are only suitable for the kind of battlefield in East Ukraine that does not emphasize movement warfare, and they are easily defeated on high-intensity battlefields by advanced adversaries like the U.S. military. They are prone to be paralyzed by advanced adversaries like the U.S. Army in high-intensity battlefields by knocking out their nodes. Although our synthetic battalions have significantly surpassed the Russians in terms of weapons and equipment performance and even possess many weapons and equipment that the Russians do not, their digitization and informatization capabilities are close to those of the U.S. military, and their command and combat systems are very similar to those of the U.S. military, [but] it is difficult to verify their tactical rationality because they have not been hardened by combat. Considering that both militaries need to deal with high-intensity ground warfare and even face a common strategic competitor, the China-Russian Joint Western 2021 strategic exercise provides an opportunity for the two militaries to learn from each other’s strengths and complement each other’s weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military exercises are the most sensitive activity in the relationship between two countries, and mutual participation in internal strategic exercises is the highest level of military cooperation. In recent years, the PLA has been advancing at a rapid pace that is visible to the naked eye. Synthetic battalions have become the main combat force of the PLA’s ground forces, integrating many advantages such as miniaturization, versatility, streamlining, and modularity, [while] highlighting the concepts of information dominance, system support, elite combat, and joint victory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this new quality of combat capability still requires the lubrication of actual battlefield experience to realize its military competitive value more effectively. That is why it was significant to exchange in-depth tactical “experiences” with the Russian Army through the China-Russia Joint Western 2021 strategic exercise, which is also an excellent reflection of the fact that “there is no limit, no forbidden zone, no upper limit” for Chinese-Russian strategic cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relations between China and Russia in the space industry have intensified sharply in recent years. The two powers have their own rockets and launch sites, are building their own satellites, and are planning an interplanetary expedition, but without joint cooperation, neither Moscow nor Beijing will be able to solve a number of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The space program has become a top priority for China: its budget and ambition leave no doubt that Beijing intends to significantly strengthen its position in the space industry over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The secret of success is large financial injections, persistence, and Russian technology, which helped the Chinese space program to make a significant leap in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooperation between Russia and China in the space industry is based on two documents: an intergovernmental agreement of December 18, 1992, and an interagency agreement of March 25, 1994. Since the early 2000s, the parties have promoted the idea of joint research and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, but for a long time there was no talk about a breakthrough cooperation. The situation began to change in 2014, when after the reunification of Crimea with Russia, the United States vetoed the supply of high-tech products; a ban was also imposed on the electronic component base that was used in satellite construction. The space industry had some reserves, but it was necessary to look for a complete substitute for U.S. products in the short term. A suitable replacement was found in China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2018, Russia and China discussed the possibility of creating a joint space station. However, N. Eismont of the Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences notes that space exploration cannot be a purely national task. According to him, the Chinese side, which plans to start building a multi-module space station in the next few years, is interested in the Russian experience of long-term space flights and construction of large space objects. In addition, Beijing lacks a number of important technologies and is ready to offer its partnership to Moscow in exchange for them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, in a sense, due to the U.S. position, China is in a kind of isolation. For many years now, the United States has been doing everything possible to prevent the development of science and technology in China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why China is looking for other partners, and the result of this search, to a large extent, is the cooperation that the Russian Federation is developing/offering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the whole, the space sector [of cooperation] was [following] the general trend of development of Russian-Chinese relations, which began to sharply improve after the sanctions against Russia were imposed by Europe and the United States. China is extremely interested in buying Russian RD180 engines, which could be used in Chinese rocket production, while Russia is interested in supplying Chinese space radio-electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both sides have shown considerable interest in such cooperation. In summer 2016, the governments of Russia and China signed an agreement on measures to protect technologies in the exploration and use of outer space: in other words, the Chinese side will not be able to engage in unlicensed copying of Russian products. This was the main condition that Moscow put forward for the beginning of substantive negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, the logic of this decision is simple: with a huge number of opponents and lack of like-minded people, it is necessary to be friends with China. All the more so because in the conditions of economic recession, when industry funding is constantly being sequestered, it is almost impossible for Russia to implement projects like the lunar or Mars missions on its own. The success of China’s space program raises the legal question of whether it will compete with Russia. After all, Russia’s position in space is not only one of the undeniable reasons of national pride, but also a significant source of income.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, according to V. Kashin, a leading researcher of the Institute of Air Force Development of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russians do not consider the Chinese as competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are no concerns about being squeezed out of the commercial launch sector. Production costs in China are already higher than in our country. At the same time, salaries in dollar terms in the Chinese rocket industry are several times higher. This became especially obvious after the devaluation of the ruble.” A. Ionin, a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Cosmonautics named after A.A. Tsiolkovsky, believes that the Chinese are simply not interested in the commercial cosmonautics market. “They have too many national tasks, and commercial launches are not the main priority here. China does not need the money.” In addition, China is still under U.S. sanctions, and this prevents it from reaching the most profitable customers from Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editor’s Note: This article is not written by leading Russian scholars; however, the authors cover strategic goals and challenges and provide a useful framework for understanding the negative and positive outcomes of Russian-Chinese cooperation in space (or lack thereof).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current trends in the world aerospace field allow us to speak about the beginning of a new space race. The key feature of the increased interest in exploration of extraterrestrial spaces is a significant expansion of private sector capabilities in the field of design and launch of transport and manned spacecraft — we are talking primarily about large non-state corporations of this industry (for example, the “Space Exploration Technologies Corporation” of American entrepreneur Elon Musk, “Blue Origin” of American billionaire Jeffrey Bezos, or “Boeing,” the transnational aviation giant).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the Russian Federation, maintaining and expanding its existing position in the space industry is one of the highest priorities at the moment. The significance of the issue lies not only in the need for Russia to retain its status as a space power, which it inherited together with the technical potential of the Soviet Union as the legal successor of the latter. The developed world’s close attention to near-Earth space and other planets for the purposes of scientific study and possible militarization determines the desire of Russia to at least prevent a technological lag in space exploration, and at most claim equal participation in the use of extraterrestrial resources. The complicated geopolitical situation that developed in the mid-2010s forces Russia to strengthen cooperation in the space sphere with its strategic partners, among which the People’s Republic of China has traditionally occupied a key position recently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For China, which in many ways faces similar foreign policy realities as Russia, space is also of great value. The space program of the “Celestial Empire,” despite its relatively short existence, has already demonstrated significant success in the field of space robotics and communication technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consequently, China naturally faces the question of whether it should maintain cooperation with Russia in the aerospace industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China has a significant material and resource base for the implementation of the space program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At present, however, China fully covers the technological needs for the design and modernization of the rocket fleet with its own production; development of a reusable spacecraft (the “Shenlong”) is underway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;External and internal destabilizing factors have no significant impact on the implementation of China’s space projects. The COVID-19 epidemic, which began in China in late 2019, has not prevented CASC from conducting four rocket launches since the beginning of 2020. In terms of foreign policy, China’s space ambitions also meet little resistance from Western countries, especially the United States, due to the latter’s increased attention to Mars exploration. If the current conditions remain unchanged, it is safe to say that China is highly likely to achieve its goals of launching its own space station and landing taikonauts on the lunar surface. As for Russia, the foundation of the Russian space industry was laid during the Soviet Union, and by the beginning of the 2020s, Russia managed to be firmly entrenched in the top three space powers of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The level of technical development of the Russian space industry meets the requirements for maintaining a position in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turning to the most urgent problems of Russian cosmonautics, we emphasize that in recent years there has been a negative trend towards stagnation in the rate of rocket launches relative to other leading space powers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to preserving the number of launches, a significant problem at present is the pronounced costliness of the industry and the corruption of related enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking into account the growing competition on the part of private U.S. corporations, it is possible that in the future Russian rockets will be unprofitable to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To determine the prospects for Russian-Chinese cooperation, let us review current joint space arrangements. In September 2019, at a regular meeting of the heads of the governments of Russia and China, Roscosmos CEO Dmitry Rogozin and CNSA head Zhang Kejian agreed to cooperate in the creation of a data center for lunar projects and deep space, as well as in the coordination of the “LunaResource-1” space mission in 2022 and “Chang’e-7” in 2023. A year earlier, there had been talks about bilateral participation in the creation of a Chinese orbital station, and in November 2017, Russian and Chinese state corporations signed a program of cooperation in the space field for 2018–2022. Despite the largely declarative nature of these statements, there is a clear trend towards strengthening the partnership between Russia and China, which is due to the aggressive external environment and long-term cooperation in this industry. What are the possible scenarios for the development of cooperation between Russia and China in the foreseeable future? Despite a declared commitment to a productive dialogue, the rapid technological growth of the Celestial Empire in rocket and space exploration is obvious, and its ambitions to explore other planets and outer space question the necessity of involving other countries, including Russia. An important factor is the role of external powers that also are aiming to maintain a presence in space: the United States and India, which is actively developing its own space program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vasily Kashin, “Россия и Китай ответят на создание космических войск США – эксперт,” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://eurasia.expert/rossiya-i-kitay-otvetyat-na-sozdanie-kosmicheskikh-voysk-ssha/&quot;&gt;Russia and China Answer to the Creation of Space Forces by the USA – Expert, Eurasia Expert, September 2020&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outer space has already become a military platform. Space systems are now necessary for a number of key weapon systems, in particular munitions with satellite guidance and unmanned aerial vehicles with long flight times. These weapons systems do not live without space at all, but all the rest also depend on space to some degree. Accordingly, ensuring the operation of the entire space infrastructure, including space-based communications, positioning, and reconnaissance assets, becomes a priority issue. The development of means to combat space objects is also becoming a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States has lost much of its former military superiority in many other areas, but so far no one can match them in space. Trump’s decision to create a separate kind of military force is designed to maximize U.S. superiority and achieve overwhelming dominance in space. Other countries, including China and Russia, will have to respond to it to some degree, and so there will be an arms race in space. The placement of weapons in space will not necessarily come immediately. It may not happen for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is building up its forces very strongly now, and it is the number two power in the world (Russia is number three) in terms of satellite constellations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space is becoming increasingly important precisely because of the development of new types of weapons: drones, satellite-guided precision munitions, and space reconnaissance systems. In the Cold War era, these means were much more primitive and had longer reaction times, but now you have the opportunity to take them to another level. An important factor in the future will be the development of artificial intelligence technologies, which will allow a new level of processing of space reconnaissance data, dramatically increase its effectiveness, and possibly change the approaches to nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space remains primarily in the military [domain]. All this piloted space flight is ornamentation, while military space operations are on a different scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For prestige reasons, China is promoting the development of science, and we are lagging behind here. We have no resources, and there is only a weak organizational capability. We are able to solve some military tasks, but we cannot compete with China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have cooperation, of course. The golden age was in the 1990s and 2000s, when China’s manned program and many other programs rose largely due to Russian technology. Now the Chinese are already sensing their own strength and “advancement,” and maybe their need for cooperation with us is no longer so high, although it continues. At the dawn of the crisis and the aggravation of relations with the West in 2014, when we were cut off from the supply of components, there was talk that we would supply new types of powerful rocket engines to China, and that the Chinese would help us establish production of electronic parts and components for space. It is not clear where that went — apparently it hasn’t worked out yet, but these are usually long negotiations. We will see more and more closure of these cooperation programs, because the U.S. sanctions pressure on Russia and China is growing. However, cooperation will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main goal is to create the information infrastructure that enables the use of weapons on Earth. That is, it is the provision of reconnaissance and positioning resources, without which the effective use of high-precision weapons is impossible. Accordingly, the use of high-precision weapons spurs the development of space systems, and new capabilities of space systems, in turn, lead to new high-precision weapons. In the future, demand will increase further by the development of robotic complexes and systems and the further development of unmanned systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the other side will have an even greater need, first, to interfere with satellite positioning and communication systems and reconnaissance, and second, to be able to shoot down these satellites. This will all develop at an increasing rate for the foreseeable future. An additional factor that affects the arms race in space is the development of missile defense systems, since ground-based missiles for hitting targets are a side effect of the development of missile defense. They are often just a variant of a missile defense application that sometimes needs some small change in software. And, because, again, missile defense is developing at a high rate in several countries, we will see an increase in the number of threats to satellites and, therefore, attempts to protect them. At some point, we will also see the placement of weapons in space, but that probably won’t be the first thing that will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a priority for China to push science forward, because their main field of competition with the United States is in science and technology. Through this, China greatly increases its national prestige, because they are already the second country in the world in the field of space research. Since their investments and potential are growing, they have a chance of someday standing on an equal footing and competing for primacy. In many ways, this reproduces the picture of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He Qisong and Ye Nishan, “中国与俄罗斯太空合作分析” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://r.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?filename=ELSY202104008&amp;amp;dbcode=CFJD&amp;amp;dbname=CFJDTEMP&quot;&gt;Analysis of Space Cooperation between China and Russia, Russian Studies Journal, no. 4, August 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Against this overall background, bilateral space cooperation has gradually intensified and is a concrete expression of the improvement and upgrading of relations between the two countries. In order to preserve space security, national security, and the stability of the international strategic landscape, China and Russia maintain close cooperation on space diplomacy, the objective being to create an external environment conducive to national development. When it comes to space technology cooperation, geopolitical factors play an important role. The space development dynamics of China and Russia, as well as the U.S. strategy of space hegemony (including space weaponization policies and practices), are the key variables in space technology cooperation between the two sides. The expansion and deepening of China-Russia space cooperation dovetails with the development of political relations between the two countries in response to changes in space geopolitics and also has an impact on the shaping of space geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From an overall perspective, China-Russia space technology cooperation since the end of the Cold War can be roughly divided into two stages, with the Ukraine crisis in 2014 as the dividing line. The first stage was one of shallow cooperation, mainly in the form of a bilateral “buying and selling relationship.” After the Ukraine crisis, space cooperation between the two countries further expanded and deepened, forming a China-Russia space cooperation relationship with space technology, space science, and space equipment intertwined. In 1970, China successfully launched the “Dongfanghong-1” satellite, thus entering the space club. Although this achievement was the result of China’s self-reliance and hard work, it should not be overlooked that China’s move into space also benefited from the assistance of the Soviet Union: China’s launch vehicle technology originated from Soviet assistance in ballistic missile technology, and the Soviet Union trained a number of young scientists and engineers for the development of China’s aerospace endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the resolution of border issues between China and Russia in the 1990s, bilateral relations were gradually improved and enhanced, and space cooperation could be realized. The 1992 agreement on intergovernmental space cooperation between China and Russia and the 1994 cooperation agreement between the space ministries of the two countries were the beginnings of bilateral space cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bilateral space cooperation after the Cold War began in the manned spaceflight field. After China established its manned space program, Russia provided the reference for China’s design of the Shenzhou series of spacecraft. The Russian side not only supplied China with spacesuits but also trained Chinese astronauts and provided technical support for their first spaceflight activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until 2006, the two countries generally cooperated in three areas: satellites, space science, and basic components. In 2007, the two countries signed a cooperation agreement on the joint exploration of Mars — with the Russian Mars probe “Phobos-Grunt” (Фобос-Грунт) to carry the Chinese probe “Yinghuo-1,” and the Russian space-based observatory to be used for joint deep space exploration — but the project was scrubbed due to the failure of the Russian launch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before 2014, however, China-Russia space technology cooperation still lagged behind the two countries’ political engagement. After the Ukraine crisis in 2014, space cooperation between the two sides entered a new phase in which cooperation not only expanded in breadth but also increased in depth. Cooperation on positioning and navigation satellites was the starting point of the new phase of cooperation between the two countries. The United States and other Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia under the pretext of the Ukraine crisis, including a ban on the export to Russia of satellite-borne electronic equipment, which is precisely one of Russia’s shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During President Putin’s visit to China in 2016, the Russian and Chinese governments signed an agreement on the protection of intellectual property rights in the field of space technology, clearing away legal barriers to the development of in-depth cooperation in space technology between the two countries. In September 2017, the two countries finalized the Outline of China-Russia Space Cooperation for 2018–2022, which includes projects on lunar and deep space development, rocket engine and satellite-borne electronic equipment transactions, etc. This is the first five-year agreement between the two countries. It is within this framework that the two countries have realized the vision of cooperation agreed upon several years ago: the purchase of Russian RD-180 rocket engines by China and the export of satellite electronics to Russia. The two countries also held negotiations in 2018 on the joint production of RD-180 rocket engines. A key point in the implementation of the five-year outline of space cooperation is to take substantial steps in lunar and other deep-space exploration fields. After the United States and other Western countries closed the door to cooperation with it, Russia has clearly strengthened its willingness to engage in lunar exploration with China, looking to make up for its failure to go to the moon during the Cold War era with a successful lunar landing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2018, the two countries discussed the possibility of cooperation in lunar research and deep space exploration, and in 2019 they signed an agreement to establish a data center for lunar and deep space exploration to share relevant information, including on the moon and Mars. . . . This is a historic agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China and Russia have also taken important steps in cooperation involving the space security field. If the above-mentioned cooperation in space is limited to the peaceful use of space, cooperation between the two countries in the anti-missile and missile early warning system fields is cooperation on space security. Following cyber anti-missile exercises in 2016 and 2017, President Putin announced at a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club in October 2019 that Russia is helping China build a missile early warning system, which will significantly increase China’s defense capabilities. Only Russia and the United States currently possess missile early warning systems, which include both space-based and ground-based systems. Russia’s assistance on China’s construction of a missile early warning system, whether by helping China develop space-based sensors, building ground-based radar systems, or sharing software and information for space-based and ground-based warning systems, will enhance China’s anti-missile capabilities and sky monitoring capabilities. In addition, in December 2020, China and Russia extended their agreement on mutual notification of missile launches. Given the U.S. withdrawal from the INF Treaty and the global arms control regime suffering another setback, the continued strengthening of China-Russia cooperation and coordination on mutual notification of ballistic missiles and on-launch vehicles contributes to global strategic stability and security. If in the previous phase of China-Russia space cooperation the two countries only cooperated at a superficial level, the recent phase of space cooperation between the two sides has significantly expanded and deepened. It not only includes the sale of components but has also deepened into cooperation in space technology and space science and further expanded into the field of space security. China-Russia space cooperation has thus taken substantial steps. As China’s space technology continues to make strides, large-scale space projects — including the BeiDou system and deep space exploration on the moon and Mars — are advancing steadily and making great achievements, while Russia is under sanctions from the United States and other Western countries and its space budget is restricted. This has affected the progress of space projects, making Russia change its past “strong” posture and negotiate with China on an equal footing, which in turn reflects the win-win nature of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While one can say that the above China-Russia space technology cooperation is divided into two phases, before and after [the 2014 Ukraine crisis], space diplomacy cooperation between the two countries has maintained a close posture ever since the end of the Cold War, because space is tightly linked to international security and national security. As is well known, the advent of the space age was closely tied to the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms race. Space is the “eyes and ears” of strategic nuclear forces and is an extremely important aid in strategic deterrence. With the development of space technology, satellites not only became information platforms that provide services and facilitation for military operations — such as communications, weather, and navigation — but also firepower platforms or firepower delivery platforms. As a result, satellites became military force “multipliers” and “enablers,” and a space dominance doctrine also emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under circumstances where diplomatic efforts were unable to curb the U.S. weaponization of space, some countries had to take countermeasures, developing and stockpiling anti-satellite weapons, and thus opening the curtain on a new round of the space arms race. Space-based and ground-based kinetic anti-satellite weapons, directed energy anti-satellite weapons, and cyber and radio frequency anti-satellite weapons have emerged or will soon emerge. Given the irreplaceable role of space and its technologies for economic and social development, the weaponization of space not only threatens the safety of satellites operating in orbit but also has serious negative effects on economic development and social welfare. Furthermore, the increasingly close integration of space with the command and control systems of a country’s military leads to potentially huge threats to national security. More importantly, the integration of space and nuclear strategic forces, along with the weaponization of space, can have serious and potentially disruptive effects on international strategic balance and stability. In short, the weaponization of space is a threat to world peace and can also cause enormous damage to economic development and social welfare. To strengthen national security and promote economic development, as well as to maintain international security, China and Russia cooperate with each other in summit diplomacy and in multilateral processes, taking practical actions to prevent the arms race in space and the weaponization of space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the United States moved to implement theater missile defense systems and a national missile defense system, China and Russia judged that the United States was likely to withdraw from the ABM Treaty, and therefore called on the United States to comply with it. The November 1998 Joint Statement on Sino-Russian Relations at the Turn of the Century, the December 1999 Sino-Russian Joint Statement, and the July 2000 Joint Statement on Anti-Ballistic Missile Issues all emphasized that the ABM Treaty is a cornerstone of international strategic stability, and that the U.S. development of a national missile defense system and construction of ABM systems would have destructive effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, the United States has not only expanded its ABM system in spite of the international community’s opposition, but it has also deployed the “Shore-based Aegis” system and the “SAD” system in Europe and Asia, and further developed and stockpiled space weapons, sharply increasing the threat that space will be weaponized and turned into a zone of military confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June 2019, the heads of state of China and Russia once again expressed their concerns and worries. Calling on all countries to work to ban the weaponization of space, they said that U.S. withdrawal from the INF Treaty undermines strategic stability and triggers an arms race; the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, and especially “the development of its strategic anti-missile systems, and its plans to deploy them in different regions of the world and in space, continue to have serious negative repercussions for international and regional strategic balance, and security stability,” and “the real prospect of an arms race in space, and its evolution into a frontier of military conflict, threaten strategic stability.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, the originator of the weaponization of space in the post-Cold War era was the United States, and the goal of preventing an arms race in space and controlling space armaments can only be truly achieved by reaching a legally binding international treaty with the United States prohibiting the weaponization of space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bilateral relations have made a qualitative leap, and a new type of Sino relations has been established that is “non-Russian aligned, nonconfrontational, and not targeted at third parties,” and political friendship and trust have laid a firm foundation for in-depth cooperation between the two countries in various fields. China-Russia space technology cooperation is the result of the deepening development of relations between China and Russia, whether that cooperation is in space equipment (e.g., rockets, satellite-borne electronics), joint technology research (e.g., space materials), data cooperation (e.g., deep space exploration information), or technical and policy cooperation involving space security. It is a concrete manifestation of the close relationship between the two countries. The expansion and deepening of once nonexistent space cooperation between the two countries also resulted from the respective space development dynamics of China and Russia, while the United States has been a key variable as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In particular, at times of great achievements in China’s manned spaceflight, BeiDou system, and lunar exploration projects, or when they were about to make great achievements or afterwards, Russia significantly slowed down the process of space cooperation with China. “This kind of cooperation was modest in scale in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and this momentum has waned since then.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difficulty in advancing such cooperation lay partly in the fact that Russia and China had yet to sign an agreement on the protection of intellectual property rights in space fields, but the real reason was that Russia considered itself technologically advanced in space and feared that “serious” cooperation with China would develop China into a competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is well known, launch vehicle engines are indeed the core technical components of missiles. Russia banned the export of RD-180 rocket engines to China on the grounds that doing so would violate the Missile Technology Control Regime. Russia let the engines be sold to the United States, however, and even after being subjected to U.S. sanctions, it did not use the mechanism mentioned above to initiate counter-sanctions. This once again showed that Russia did not want to promote the improvement of Chinese space technology through cooperation and turn China into a competitor. On the one hand, in the first phase Russia generally considered its space technology superior to China’s, so cooperation in space was a “gift” to China. On the other hand, with the development of Chinese space technology, including manned spaceflight, Russia was wary of cooperation because it feared that China would overtake it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the existence of a significant portion of pro-Western forces within Russia and the sowing of discord between Russia and China by the United States and the West, from a power transfer point of view, Russia’s decline from Soviet-era superpower to one of the world’s top powers resulted in a significant psychological disconnect, and feelings about China’s rise were complicated. Therefore, in the first phase of China-Russia space cooperation, Russia did not have a sincere desire to cooperate with China. At that time, Russia preferred to cooperate with the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, although Russia extended an olive branch of space cooperation to China to promote Sino-Russian relations and alleviate the strategic pressure exerted on it by the United States, the European Union, and NATO, it feared that cooperation between the two countries would promote China’s technological progress in space, thereby diminishing its voice in Sino-Russian relations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of the technological gap, the degree of Russian-Chinese space cooperation was not as high as Russian-U.S. space cooperation, so Russian-Chinese space cooperation was limited to a buying and selling relationship for some time. More importantly, Russia’s fear that China’s rise would impinge upon its political and economic interests led to further conservatism in China-Russia cooperation in science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The crisis in Ukraine — and especially the annexation of Crimea by Russia — led the West to impose tougher sanctions on Russia, once again demonstrating that the West fundamentally distrusts Russia and still sees Russia as a security threat, especially with Biden having called Putin a “killer.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the influence of Western sanctions and the COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of funding for the development of Russia’s space industry and the aging and loss of S&amp;amp;T personnel — including in the space field — have combined to further slow the development of Russia’s space technology and industry, and there are even difficulties in maintaining satellite ground facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, development of China’s space industry has been rapid, especially in the twenty-first century, and China’s space technology has become increasingly sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The development of China’s space technology and industry and the advancement of its space program have propelled China’s rapid space power development. Russia’s space technology, industry, and program have progressed more slowly, and the pace of its development has been far below China’s. China’s leap in space technology has led to a relatively substantial reduction in Russia’s overall space advantage, and its sense of superiority has fallen along with it. While Russia still has certain advantages, by expanding and deepening cooperation with China and mutually complementing advantages with China in the fields of deep space exploration and navigation satellites Russia can exchange its advantages for technologies and equipment it does not have, based on the principle of reciprocity. Therefore, Russia decided to cooperate in the field of positioning and navigation satellites, which was a breakthrough in space cooperation with China. In this second stage, Russia is cooperating with China in space technology on an equal footing, with almost no sense of superiority, and it has provided China with missile early warning system technology while China has given Russia corresponding assistance in space technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in the process of China-Russia space cooperation, there are three aspects that indeed surpass the geopolitical considerations between China and Russia, and this is beyond doubt. First, China-Russia space cooperation promotes the development of space technology in both countries and plays an important role in forming a stable China-U.S.-Russia triangular relationship in space, which is in the interests of both countries. . . . Secondly, the two countries’ close cooperation on launch vehicle engines and global navigation systems, and their commitment to cooperation on an international lunar station, etc., will not only contribute to the joint progress of Russian and Chinese space technology but will also help in building strategic stability and a balanced landscape in space, in making space a common heritage of all mankind, and in striving to put into practice the principles and purposes of the peaceful uses of space as established in the preamble and Article I of the Outer Space Treaty. And thirdly, space cooperation between the two countries will be conducive to the development of the space production chains of both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, they can also give full play to their comparative advantages in the space field, expand and extend production chains, form a new division of labor system, drive the development of technology overall, and enhance their ability to resist Western sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space cooperation between China and Russia has enhanced mutual political trust between the two countries and further deepened their strategic partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooperation between the two countries on space diplomacy will further consolidate and deepen the strategic partnership. China and Russia alike face strategic pressure from U.S. antimissile systems and space weapons, and the two countries have cooperated with each other at the United Nations, the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and the Conference on Disarmament, making ceaseless efforts to prevent an arms race in space and contribute to the maintenance of global strategic stability, as well as making arduous efforts to build a fair and just space governance system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China-Russia space cooperation is the result of space geopolitics, and space cooperation between the two countries will likewise reshape space geopolitics. It will contribute to the relative stability of the space order, specifically by contributing to the multipolarity of space; prevent celestial bodies such as the moon from being enclosed by the United States and other countries; and prevent the weaponization of space, which will have an important impact on the formation of the future rules of space governance and the shaping of the future space landscape. The key to maintaining a multipolar space hinges on a relatively stable China-U.S.-Russia space triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, with the outbreak of the [2014] crisis in Ukraine, and especially since the Trump administration took office, the space landscape has taken on an asymmetrical character, with an almost entirely one-sided tilt toward the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This trend is detrimental to the stability of the space landscape. With the expansion and deepening of China-Russia space cooperation, there is bound to be rapid development of mutual cooperation between their research institutes and enterprises, whether in state-led space projects or in commercial space projects, and the number of state-owned satellites and commercial satellite constellations launched by the two countries will certainly increase a great deal, narrowing the gap with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In view of the attempts of the United States and other Western countries to seek sovereignty over celestial bodies under the pretext of deep space exploration and planetary resource development, China and Russia have repeatedly signed agreements on deep space exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies, jointly exploring and landing on the moon, establishing their own lunar bases, and setting up a joint lunar research station open to the world. This indicates to the world that any attempt by any country to use advanced technology to enclose the moon and Mars will be strongly opposed by China and Russia, which are determined to preserve the status and properties of the moon and other celestial bodies as a global commons and the common heritage of all mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The weaponization of space by the United States and its allies in NATO and elsewhere is undoubtedly causing damage to the peaceful use of space, as well as to global strategic stability and balance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, China and Russia possess some degree of antisatellite capability, and they have held joint cyber anti-missile exercises as a direct response to the United States’ weaponization of space and refusal to conclude an international treaty banning the weaponization of space. Although the two countries’ space cooperation does not directly involve anti-satellite content, cooperation in the field of space technology, which is dual-use technology, has a strong connotations of a military alliance in space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, President Putin announced in 2019 that Russia is helping China build a missile early warning system. This was a strong signal that the two countries are cooperating substantively in the military space field, enhancing the defense partnership between Russia and China, and potentially forming a joint Sino-Russian anti-missile system. The possibility of Russia exporting to China S-500 anti-missile systems with anti-space weapon capabilities in the event of a deteriorating space situation is not ruled out, nor is the possibility of China-Russia cooperation in anti-space technology. According to U.S. reports, China and Russia have different anti-missile capabilities and technologies, with Russia’s space-based co-orbital “nesting doll” anti-satellite technology and China’s mid-range anti-missile technology and antisatellite technology each having its own advantages. Cooperation between China and Russia on anti-satellite technology could be a nightmare for U.S. satellites. Until there is a treaty banning the weaponization of space, China-Russia space cooperation, especially military cooperation in space, is a strong cornerstone for preventing space from being weaponized and turned into a battlefield. The highly developed Sino-Russian military relationship is a key factor in promoting global strategic stability, and it has played an important role in maintaining global and regional stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the imbalance in Chinese, U.S., and Russian space power, neither China nor Russia alone can stop the United States from pursuing its stated strategies and policies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China-Russia space cooperation, especially the establishment of a joint lunar research station, is a concrete attempt to implement the concept of global governance of ”negotiation, joint construction, and sharing” and to build a community of human destiny in space, and it is also a way for China to provide Chinese solutions and Chinese wisdom for changing space governance. As to whether the above goals can be achieved, or whether there will be one pole in space led by the United States and another pole with China and Russia jointly, depends to some extent on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-documents-on-sino-russian-understandings-of-hybrid-warfare&quot;&gt;Russian Documents on Sino-Russian Understandings of Hybrid Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandr Bartosh, “Китай и Россию сближает угроза гибридной войны: Медведь и панда на службе миру” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://vpk-news.ru/articles/53176&quot;&gt;China and Russia Are Brought Closer by the Threat of a Hybrid War: Bear and Panda in the Service of the World, Military-Industrial Courier, October 22, 2019&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The correlation between the concepts of “cultural focus” and “strategic culture” is an important subject for another study. Let me merely point out the closeness of the cultural focuses of Russia and China, which reflects the general interest of the two powers in defense projects and the prevention of a major military conflict. An important step in strengthening the strategic partnership was the decision of the Russian Federation to deploy a Missile Defense Alarm System (MIDAS) in the PRC. Until now, only the United States and Russia had such a system. Now, China will join them. The decision testifies to the real depth of Russian-Chinese strategic cooperation and the degree of trust between Moscow and Beijing. The latter will have at its disposal a complex of special technical means for detecting ballistic missiles, calculating their trajectory, and transmitting information to the command center, which is then reported as an attack on the state with the use of missile weapons, prompting an urgent decision on the response. There are also other steps to deepen the relations, particularly in terms of the development of measures to counter any hybrid aggression from the United States and the West as a whole, which may aim at both our countries. In this context, it would be interesting to study the approaches of Russia and China to confronting a hybrid war and a “color revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The opinions of authoritative Russian experts on hybrid warfare can be summarized as follows: the term is of Western origin. The theory of hybrid warfare, which was developed in the West, is now being tested all over the world. Its essence lies in the complex use of hard and soft power tools, in erasing the differences between war and peace, which is an important feature of the conflicts of the twenty-first century. . . . Hybrid warfare is characterized by high adaptability to the conditions in which it is prepared and conducted; a continuity and connection with “color revolutions”; and multidimensional struggle in the military, informational, economic, political, socio-cultural, and other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, General of the Army Valery Gerasimov. . . . Our response is based on active defense, which relies on theoretical studies and substantiation of a set of measures primarily aimed at the preventive neutralization of threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, the type of interstate confrontation studied by Sun Tzu is what we call “hybrid warfare.” The Chinese strategist formulated its conceptual essence: to achieve victory over the enemy without fighting it, by avoiding direct military clashes with enemy armies. He argued that the best war is waged this way: first, by breaking the plans of the enemy; second, by breaking their alliances; and only then, by breaking their troops. For millennia, the essence of Chinese technologies to “live and survive” has been the desire to achieve the necessary results with as little effort and material costs as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The technologies of the “color revolution” that Sun Tzu spoke about naturally interact with the hybrid warfare strategy. According to his plan, the main objective of a geopolitical attack during wars should, in fact, be the ruling elite of the enemy state — the ruler himself, his inner circle, and the military leaders, who must be actively influenced by various means — so as to “outplay them with a plan” and thus “prevent them from winning.” Geopolitical adversaries are trying to assign the authorship of the hybrid warfare strategy to Russia and China, arguing that today the all-encompassing integral strategy of geopolitical struggle — hybrid warfare and “color revolution” — are used by China in its competitive struggle with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it is the United States and its satellites that have long been trying to break up Russia and China, relying on the “fifth column” and other subversive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confrontation in the public mind is an important element of hybrid warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the support of the armed forces, attack and defense are carried out in areas such as social media-based public opinion, electronic means of dissemination of information, psychology, and cyberattacks. Overwhelming advantage is then achieved through the use of a large number of precision weapons in military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, the assessments of hybrid warfare strategies made by Russian and Chinese experts are very similar. From a political point of view, it is important to have a common understanding that the initiators of hybrid warfare and “color revolutions” against geopolitical competitors have been invariably the United States and Western countries. Any recognition of a single source of threats to the national security of Russia and China should serve as a unifying factor in developing a strategy for joint countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To summarize, we should note that, for Russia’s relations with China in the context of the geopolitical confrontation with the United States and the West, it seems to be extremely important that we take into account one of the distinguishing features of the Chinese logic of thinking, which has shaped its national strategic culture. Its essence is that “a unity may split in two forces, but changes would follow through a combination of not two but three forces.” Thus, by the Chinese logic, one has to find and attract a third force in the face of a clear confrontation between two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that, in today’s uncertain and chaotic international environment and in the face of its deteriorating relations with the United States, China would be interested in weakening Russia. Rather, on the contrary, an important factor in ensuring the national security of both states should be their mutual interest in each state’s stable and sustainable development. The stakes in the geopolitical confrontation between the three powers are extremely high, and we should not rule out the possibility that the United States may initiate sophisticated maneuvers to split the partnership between Moscow and Beijing. The objective of Russian politicians, diplomats, and the military should be to find a worthy response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viktor Murakhovsky, “Безопасность страны как фундамент развития” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://arsenal-otechestva.ru/article/1414-bezopasnost-strany-kak-fundament-razvitiya&quot;&gt;National Security as a Foundation for National Development, interview with Andrei Ilnitsky, Homeland’s Arsenal Journal, 51, no. 1, March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, under the influence of various currents of Western ideology, Russian society distressingly and increasingly crumbled from within. Today, we can see that part of both the Russian elite and society is ready to lean on currently fashionable Western ideological trends and lifestyles. Americans do not differentiate between informational, psychological, cyber operations, and electronic warfare, considering them as an equitable domain of a joint battle space in multidomain operations along with space, air, land, and water.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The West, led by the United States, has unleashed an information-hybrid war against Russia. Its task is to overstrain Russia, to knock us off our targets, to unbalance the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this creates a new type of warfare. While in a classical war, the goal is to destroy the opponent’s manpower, in today’s cyberwars, the goal is to destroy the opponent’s infrastructure. In fact, the goal of the new warfare is to destroy the opponent’s identity and to change the mental and civilizational basis of the opponent’s society. I would call this type of warfare mental. Furthermore, if the manpower and infrastructure can at least be restored, the evolution of identity is an irreversible process, especially if the consequences of such mental warfare emerge only gradually — and only by skipping at least a generation, when it is too late to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the main weapon here is the World Wide Web; so, whoever owns it and provides its content has a strategic advantage. Unfortunately, we must admit that in this case the advantage is not ours.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking into account the merging of manipulative and cyber-strike means, followed by their gradual legalization as tools of influence against competitors and potential adversaries during peacetime, we urgently need to clarify the role that the Russian Armed Forces should play in such a setting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digital platforms and artificial intelligence technologies can also be actively used in the desovereignization of Russia by creating gaps in national security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts know that, in the information war, there is only one tactic for victory — an offensive. So, to repel any aggressive attacks on our country, we should bring down the opponent’s agenda and seize the initiative. Now, should we then completely break off the cooperation with the West?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, no! We need a dialogue. The dialogue should not be just for the sake of a dialogue but from the platform of national interests, an example of which Putin gave at the Davos Club when he outlined our vision of the ways and scenarios of world development. I think and hope that, in the near future, “red lines” will be drawn on the geopolitical field, with the mapping of the landmarks of Russia’s national interests, which no one will be allowed to cross.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are just a few of the most important countermeasures: Internet sovereignty [and] strict blocking of the activities of foreign social media for spreading any information about unauthorized rallies and for any provocation of a protest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The West, led by the United States, avoids a direct military confrontation with Russia, as Russia is capable of inflicting unacceptable damage on them. The concept of a rapid global strike and the U.S. National Defense Strategy frankly states that the “hot war” should be preceded or completely replaced by the so-called proxy or hybrid war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Russia “does not change the minds” of our opponents, does not counteract or frustrate the aggressive plans of the United States and NATO, it will lose the initiative and be forced to maintain a passive defense in extremely unfavorable conditions. Inaction actually dooms our country to existence under the agenda imposed by Americans and their agents of influence. And this categorically does not correspond to Russia’s sovereign choice. Unfortunately, in Russia, the expert analytical support of the national security policy is far from optimal. We have not yet created an effective system corresponding to the new hybrid challenges. And the existing institutional and semantic field is broken down by departments and disciplines, which has left it unbalanced. We do not have an integrative center for development and decision making in national security, and we haven’t established a network of expert analytical institutions (think tanks) working and competing under a common government strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandr Bartosh, “Стратегии сдерживания и принуждения как инструменты дипломатии XXI века” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://nic-pnb.ru/analytics/strategii-sderzhivaniya-i-prinuzhdeniya-kak-instrumenty-diplomatii-xxi-veka/&quot;&gt;Deterrence and Coercion Strategies as Instruments of 21st Century Diplomacy, Scientific Research Center for Problems of National Security, April 2022&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main task is to take measures to protect the space of our vital interests, primarily in the territories of our neighbors, many of which have been turned into theaters of a hybrid war against Russia. It is necessary to develop a strategy for a long-term confrontation in each direction, to look for a strong ally-partner to counter, who is ready to make a significant contribution to the implementation of a long-term strategy for joint struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under these conditions, an important place should be given to maintaining, improving, and building up our intelligence potential, along with its mining and analytical structures, which are capable of carrying out systematic work to preempt enemy actions with the timely detection of non-traditional threats and the preparation of operational recommendations for their neutralization. The potential of forces and means of counterintelligence, special information structures, a well-established mechanism of military-civilian interaction and means of territorial defense should be able to guarantee the internal security of the entire country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important to consider that the sources of advantage on the battlefield will shift from traditional factors, such as the size of forces and the level of weapons, to factors such as increased efficiency in obtaining and processing intelligence information based on modern forces and means as well as the computing power used in analysis, ensuring the security of strategic management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandr Bartosh, “Разведка России в противостоянии гибридным угрозам” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://nvo.ng.ru/nvo/2017-10-06/1_968_scouting.html&quot;&gt;The Role of Russian Intelligence in Countering Hybrid Wars, Independent Military Digest, June 2017&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Together with the CSTO, CIS, and SCO allies, we should take steps to update and coordinate our capabilities of implementing preventive strategic communication and optimize our use of monitoring to counter hybrid threats, including any indicators that enable quick predictions and recognition of any threatening situations in the administrative, political, socio-economic and cultural, and ideological areas. A priority area of our joint activities together with the CSTO, the CIS, and the SCO should be to ensure our ability to reveal and fend off any threats of color revolutions in a timely fashion and to work ahead of the curve. To this end, within the framework of our joint strategy, we should develop plans to prepare for repelling any threat, introduce information exchange methods for allies and partners, and take joint steps to combat the financing of color revolutions. We should submit this as a priority project: adapting the defense capabilities of Russia, the CSTO, the CIS, and the SCO, and ensuring a response to any hybrid threats against any of the countries or coalitions. We should explore military responses to hybrid threats by developing an appropriate regulatory framework through dialog, strengthened cooperation, and coordination in terms of situational awareness, strategic communications, cybersecurity, crisis prevention, and response to countering hybrid threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandr Bartosh, “Стратегии сдерживания и принуждения как инструменты дипломатии XXI века” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://nic-pnb.ru/analytics/strategii-sderzhivani-ya-i-prinuzhdeniya-kak-instrumenty-diplomatii-xxi-veka/&quot;&gt;Deterrence and Coercion Strategies as Instruments of 21st Century Diplomacy, Scientific Research Center for Problems of National Security, April 2022&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for Russian–Chinese relations, we can attest to the advancement in their bilateral and multilateral interactions. Russia and China have developed a working mechanism for cooperation in the fields of information technology and cybersecurity. Their main working areas are: activities of the Russian–Chinese Subcommittee on Communications and Information Technologies (these concern the diversification of high-tech technology supply channels, including data storage systems and telecommunication equipment; the strengthening of network security; the improvement of management efficiency; and the development of the global information space); . . . interactions within the UN, SCO, and BRICS; . . . cooperation between the defense departments of the Russian Federation and China; . . . [and] dialogs and interactions among experts. . . . An important element in this mechanism has been the Russian–Chinese Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of Ensuring International Information Security, signed in May 2015, which defines the areas of interaction in the information and digital areas. According to the document, countries will jointly respond to the most acute threats to international information security, while opposing any uses of information and communication technologies that may assist in any terrorist acts and/or interfere with internal affairs, undermine sovereignty or political stability, or incite ethnic or religious hatred, etc. This agreement has been of fundamental importance for the countries’ bilateral relations, despite its framework nature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the process of solving any practical issues of cybersecurity, even within the SCO framework, has been quite complicated and confusing, despite the continual contacts and the existing agreement on cooperation between the countries. Cyber incidents have happened even between full members of the Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The need to extend confidence-building measures to cyberspace are also dictated by the current state of affairs within the SCO, the RIC, and in the areas where the interests of the Eurasian countries, trying to build a new type of relations, generally intersect. However, achieving mutual trust in cyberspace has been one of the most difficult problems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, there has been some progress in this direction. The defense departments of the Russian Federation and China have taken certain practical measures. These include, for example, staff network exercises. In December 2017, Russia and China held their second joint computer-aided command-and-staff missile defense exercise, Aerospace Security 2017. The first such exercises were held in May 2016 by the Central Research Institute of the Aerospace Defense Troops of the Russian Ministry of Defense. And in the summer of 2017, information appeared in the media about the study of technical capabilities for creating a joint Russian–Chinese technological platform for repelling cyber threats and reducing risks in the information space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, there has been a serious breakthrough in Russian–Chinese relations. Today, the partners have created favorable conditions for further thematic dialogs through diplomatic, military, and other channels, and for exchanging information and communication technology products. All this may contribute to the creation in the future of a special platform that would prevent any threat of risks in cyberspace. The sphere of information and digital interaction between the parties has been gradually expanding. It involves the participation in the global management of the information environment, while observing one’s own interests and understanding that one’s partner has similar aspirations. The countries have also been working on creating the conditions for cooperation in the technological sphere and in the development and creation of modern technical means for counteracting and repelling cyber threats. Thus, despite the extreme complexity and inconsistency of the international conditions, Russia and China have managed to build positive cooperative interactions in the digital sphere and to accumulate constructive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-documents-on-sino-russian-understandings-of-hybrid-warfare&quot;&gt;Chinese Documents on Sino-Russian Understandings of Hybrid Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Han Aiyong, “大国地缘政治竞争的新嬗变——以混合战争和灰色地带为例” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&amp;amp;dbname=CJFDAUTO&amp;amp;filename=JWDP202202007&quot;&gt;The New Transmutation of Geopolitical Competition among Great Powers – The Example of Hybrid Warfare and Gray Areas, Teaching and Research Journal, 2022, original version 2019&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of targeting, hybrid warfare does not seek a head-to-head conflict between the great powers, but rather focuses on how to win hearts and minds. More specifically, U.S. hybrid warfare serves the need to preserve global hegemony, and its logic is offensive and globalist. Russian hybrid warfare, on the other hand, is used to restore Russia’s glory as a Eurasian power, and its logic is defensive and Eurasian. Both point to two key fringes: strategic pivot countries and the periphery of the great powers. The competition for strategic pivot states is intended to maintain and expand the international political influence of the great powers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can be seen that hybrid warfare has a distinct political attribute of serving the needs of great power competition; that is, it does not seek head-to-head confrontation between the great powers, but rather acquires geopolitical advantages by means of proxy wars or proxy destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a means of great power competition, the impact of hybrid warfare on the competitive process is extremely obvious. First, the violent nature of hybrid warfare and the competition for the peripheral zones of the great powers and strategic pivot areas are making indirect low-intensity conflicts between the great powers a reality. Second, the combined use of various instruments in hybrid warfare has forced the great powers to pay more attention to the way they use their forces and their composition while strengthening their armed forces. Third, the competitive logic of hybrid warfare is to create a “controllable” chaos or crisis and then to shape a favorable strategic posture by rebuilding peace and restoring order. This suggests that the ability to respond to major international crises and national governance has become a key element of great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. National Security Advisory Council summarizes gray-zone tactics into 10 categories: cyber and information warfare, covert operations, special forces, support for insurgent or terrorist activities, financing of nongovernmental actors, assistance to irregular forces, economic pressure, manipulation and undermining of democratic institutions, deliberate ambiguous actions, and explicit or implicit threats of force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most basic connotation of hybrid warfare also refers to the combined use of various means of destruction. The second aspect is the combined use of unconventional and conventional tools. A common tactic in gray-zone competition is the use of historical narratives, civilian intervention, fait accompli, psychological warfare, legal warfare, and other unconventional tools, which are coordinated with conventional tools such as alliance building, forward force presence, economic sanctions, and support for opposition forces to form a combined competitive force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The geographic areas where great powers engage in geopolitical competition are usually on the periphery of another great power — that is, the strategic pivot areas and the periphery of the great powers — and in this respect, hybrid warfare, gray zones, and traditional great power competition are not dissimilar. The new twist, however, is that the great powers are increasingly focused on using “color revolutions,” cyberattacks, and narrative reshaping to induce changes within their rivals in their favor. For example, the “color revolution” as a hybrid warfare tandem configuration is an effort to magnify a certain imbalance in the field of economic and social development within the competitor country, support internal opposition and its base of activity — the fifth column, agents of foreign powers, and other forces — to create, when complemented by external forces, systemic crisis events within the competitor country. . . . This then creates the conditions for the use of coercive means to eventually destroy the legitimacy of the government’s actions or even overthrow it. This suggests a shift in the focus of the strategy of the great powers on the periphery of competition toward internal governance and the winning of hearts and minds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rise of hybrid warfare and gray zones also poses new challenges and requirements for building national capacity to respond to international crises. Russia’s hybrid warfare strategy in the Ukraine crisis has put NATO’s proudly strong response mechanism into widespread question and caused NATO to be highly alarmed. This suggests that strong military forces alone cannot effectively respond to new crisis patterns and that maximizing the effectiveness of force use depends not only on the force itself but also on the coordination between force components to create maximum synergy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new transmutation of geopolitical competition among the great powers has brought inspiration to China. It shows that the means of competition are becoming more integrated, the process of competition is becoming increasingly blurred, and although the focus of competition revolves around the international order, the essence of competition is a struggle over the strength and weakness of national governance capacity. This has at least three implications for China’s response to the increasingly fierce geopolitical competition among the great powers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One is to adhere to multilateralism and to mosaic international behavior and international interests in multilateral mechanisms as much as possible&lt;/em&gt;. . . . At the regional level, China can reduce the concerns of its neighbors about China’s rise by embedding its international behavior and international interests in multilateral mechanisms and by using the construction and smooth operation of these mechanisms to realize its own preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second, it is necessary to establish a systemic concept to deal with the geopolitical competition among the great powers&lt;/em&gt;. . . . As China’s power grows and its international influence expands, it is especially important to fully estimate the possible international and regional spillover effects of domestic policies and to have the necessary response plans. In terms of timing, it is important to integrate current and future interests, to look to the future, and to reserve sufficient space for rules of action after national rejuvenation. In terms of concrete operations, while focusing on building hard and soft power it is also necessary to pay more attention to the organization and structure of forces and the coordinated use of various forces, so that they can demonstrate more flexible and coordinated response capabilities when dealing with emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third, the fundamental strategy to deal with the geopolitical competition among the great powers lies in “doing our own thing.”&lt;/em&gt; Although geopolitical competition among the great powers is an international phenomenon, it is fundamentally a competition between the strengths and weaknesses of internal governance capabilities of states. This is evident from the use of hybrid warfare and gray zones as a means of competition, focusing on creating psychological and physical chaos within competitors to gain a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang Chensheng, “中俄协作网络空间治理的基础与路径分析” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&amp;amp;dbname=CJFDLAST2018&amp;amp;filename=GJXW201709003&quot;&gt;Reflections on the Joint Prevention of ‘Color Revolutions’ in Russia and China, Eurasian Humanities Studies, 2022&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The term “color revolutions” originally referred specifically to the regime changes that occurred in CIS countries at the beginning of the twenty-first century. In the countries where “color revolutions” occurred, the opposition, with the support of Western countries, took advantage of the presidential and parliamentary elections to demonstrate against the government, using flowers, patterns, or clothing of a certain color as symbols in order to force the government leaders to step down and establish a pro-Western regime based on Western values.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should be said that the “color revolutions” around the peripheral regions of Russia and China are only “pre-game warm-ups,” and that Russia and China are the ultimate targets of the “color revolutions” carried out by the United States and other Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In recent years, as the United States and other Western countries have successfully implemented “color revolutions” in Central Asia and other regions, the circle of “color revolutions” against China and Russia has been quietly tightened. While actively promoting it externally, the United States and other Western countries are also trying to find a breakthrough in China and Russia, frequently meddling in the internal affairs of the two countries and staging despicable plays to subvert legitimate regimes in China and Russia. In addition, Biden has issued several tough statements against China and Russia since he took office. All these signs indicate that the threat of “color revolutions” in China and Russia is growing, and it is urgent for the two countries to cooperate to prevent “color revolutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and other Western countries, in collusion with reactionary separatists inside and outside of China, have openly fabricated and provoked China’s internal social problems in an attempt to dismantle China from within by means of “color revolutions.” Whether in the separatist activities of “Xinjiang independence” and “Tibet independence,” or in the Occupy Central rallies and “legislative amendment fiasco” in Hong Kon the West is behind them all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In recent years, Russia has witnessed several large-scale demonstrations against President Vladimir Putin. Although it cannot be ruled out that some of these demonstrations do express some legitimate political demands of the people, the real situation is that the United States wants to use the social contradictions in Russia to fan the flames and maliciously intensify the conflict between the people and the government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondly, “color revolutions” tend to involve younger people. Compared to the traditional “color revolution” in which middle-aged people were the main force, the participants of the “color revolution” in recent years tend to be younger and younger, and students have become the vanguard of the “color revolution”. . . . Not only is the use of social media by the opposition much cheaper and more efficient, the instantaneous nature of social media messages is also more insidious and difficult to combat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One new development that we must pay particular attention to in terms of the threat of a “color revolution” against Russia and China is the arrival of Democrat Joe Biden in the White House in early 2021. Compared to his predecessor, Donald Trump, the possibility of a “color revolution” in the United States under Biden’s leadership has increased significantly, and the threat of a “color revolution” against Russia and China, as the main core targets, has increased.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, “the more turbulent the world becomes, the more resolute Chinese-Russian cooperation will be.” China and Russia will build a model of strategic mutual trust, firmly support one another in defending their core vital interests, jointly oppose “color revolutions,” combat all kinds of disinformation, and safeguard the autonomy and security of each regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese and Russian media must strengthen cooperation and effectively carry out international public opinion guidance and public opinion struggles. At present, the dominance of international public opinion is firmly held by Western countries led by the United States. . . . Faced with the powerful public opinion offensive of the West, China and Russia should not simply defend themselves and respond passively but should also make joint statements, take the initiative, and actively engage in a war of international public opinion with the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SCO and CSTO are both regional security organizations, and maintaining regional security and stability is a common goal for both. At present, most of the SCO and CSTO member states are common members of both organizations, and most of them are countries at high risk of “color revolutions.” Therefore, it is very important for the two to cooperate in dealing with “color revolutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two organizations should intensify their military exercises to jointly respond to external interventions. During the political crisis in Belarus in 2020, the opposition fled abroad after the failure of the planned “color revolution” only to receive strong support from Western countries, with plans to launch another campaign to seize power from abroad. For example, the leader of the Belarusian opposition, Tikhanovskaya, who fled to Poland, was given an official residence in the capital as a “presidential palace in exile,” while Lithuania helped her set up an opposition coordination committee in the Lithuanian capital. In addition, Europe and the United States have pressured Belarusian authorities to overthrow Lukashenko’s regime through verbal intimidation, threats of sanctions, and leading NATO troops up to the Belarusian border. In the face of dual pressure from the domestic opposition and the external military, the government in power is usually unable to cope. For this reason, the two organizations should focus on strengthening military exercises with emphasis on emergency response in case of intervention by external forces in member states so that member states will have the strength to resist “color revolution” attempts in the face of external intervention. For example, shortly after the outbreak of the Belarusian crisis, the CSTO held the Indestructible Brotherhood 2020 joint military exercise in Belarus in response to NATO’s provocations on the Belarusian border. In the future, the SCO should also strengthen the organization of targeted military exercises in similar emergency situations to prevent external forces from violently interfering in the internal affairs of the organization’s member states. At the same time, the two organizations can attempt to conduct cross-organizational military exercises to jointly defend peace and tranquility in Eurasia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two organizations should strengthen exchanges and communication between member states and work together to deal with the threat of “color revolutions.” The SCO and CSTO should conduct security dialogues on the topic of “color revolutions” so that countries can share and exchange information within the organization, conduct risk assessments of “color revolutions” in relevant countries, and then formulate countermeasures to mitigate risks as swiftly as possible. Specifically, member states can be organized to exchange experiences on coping with “color revolutions.” For example, Russia has rich experience in dealing with “color revolutions;” in recent years, Russia has not only successfully thwarted several “color revolutions” against its own country but also accumulated a wealth of practical experience in the process of responding to “color revolutions” in CIS countries, with an impressive capacity for maintaining national interests and strategic security in crisis management. In addition, Russia has adopted legislative control over foreign NGOs and news media, as well as strict legal management of parades and assemblies (Jiang Li, 2015: 13). Russia can teach and share the above experience with members of the two organizations. As an important member of the SCO, China can share with other member states its experience in handling the Hong Kong issue in recent years. As the saying goes, preparedness ensures success, unpreparedness spells failure. Only in this way can we address “the weakest link” and can the overall capacity of member states to deal with “color revolutions” be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shan Xiaoying, “关于中俄共同防范“颜色革命”的思考” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&amp;amp;dbname=CJFDLAST2022&amp;amp;filename=OYRW202201004&quot;&gt;An Analysis of the Foundation and Approach of Sino-Russian Cooperation in Cyberspace Governance, Chinese Journal of Journalism and Communications, 2017&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A more important basis for collaboration is that both governments share the same perception of “cyber sovereignty” and prefer a government-led “multilateralism” mechanism of cyberspace governance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the issue of the attributes of cyberspace, the United States and other information powers consider cyberspace to be a “public domain” and therefore deny or hold an ambiguous attitude toward “cyber sovereignty.” In contrast, China and Russia consider cyberspace as a new domain of national sovereignty and an extension of national sovereignty in cyberspace and thus insist that “cyber sovereignty” is as sacrosanct as national territory. In December 2012, Russia proposed the initiative of “cyber sovereignty” at the United Nations International Telecommunication Union. China’s New National Security Law clarifies the concept of “sovereignty in cyberspace” through legislation. While there is international controversy over “cyber sovereignty,” it is undeniable that the infrastructure and equipment of the internet, the information that flows through it, and the people who use it are all closely linked to traditional states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, China and Russia face a great crisis in the field of information network technology and security, and both have a strong desire to guarantee national cybersecurity and participate in global cyberspace governance. As emerging countries, China and Russia have advantages in certain cutting-edge technologies, though there are still gaps in their independent research and development capabilities in core technologies, key equipment, and operating systems for information networks compared with information powerhouses such as the United States. Moreover, as the independent controllability of cybersecurity is weak, the hidden dangers of their cybersecurity are also more prominent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both China and Russia have outstanding problems with cybersecurity, and thus the two sides can ensure future cybersecurity by promoting the international cybersecurity regime, strengthening technical exchanges between the two countries, and joint law enforcement and other forms of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Russian and Chinese governments should also strengthen exchanges and cooperation on cybersecurity technologies, improve the ability of both countries to prevent cybercrimes and information attacks, effectively improve the ability of both countries to guarantee cybersecurity, and work together for the goal of building autonomous and controllable cyber systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the Russian government strongly supports the research and development of domestic information security technologies and products and insists on independent innovation. After years of efforts, it has developed its own unique advantages. The Russian companies Kaspersky and Dr.Web have not only taken the lead in the world in terms of market share of antivirus software but also provided strong support to the Russian government in terms of information security. Dr.Web is the Russian Ministry of Defense’s designated information security partner. Russia’s chip design technology is unique and has reached the world’s leading level. Russia is also working on developing its own operating system. In turn, China has accelerated the process of developing localization of network information products since 2014 and has also made significant achievements, such as the production of computer servers, with three domestic vendors in the top five server markets. . . . However, breakthroughs have not yet been achieved in the field of core hardware technologies such as chips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China and Russia are already cooperating in information security, and Kaspersky Lab has been cooperating with our government enterprises for many years. In the future, if we can further strengthen S&amp;amp;T cooperation in the field of information and cyberspace, as well as jointly carry out research and development of information and communication technologies including increasing the exchange of information and training of personnel between the two sides, it will certainly be beneficial for both sides to improve the construction of cyberspace security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the early stage of the development of the internet, the United States had absolute dominance over the governance of cyberspace due to its technological leadership. With the development of the internet in various countries, especially in a large number of developing countries, there is a demand to construct a fairer and more just cyberspace that is more in line with the common interests of all countries. The game of cyberspace governance is gradually unfolding, and the prominence of cybersecurity issues has intensified the intensity of this game. Some say this is the era of warring states in cyberspace governance, while others say that cyberspace governance is fragmenting. It is obvious that this is an era when the established system is gradually broken and a new system is being formed, and the game is quite intense and full of challenges, but also provides opportunities for emerging countries such as China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It might make sense to buy time in this way if time favored us. But it does not — time favors our adversaries. Accepting risk now to reduce the risk of worse disaster in the future is the wisest and most prudent course of action for the US, NATO, and Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West faces a choice: it can accept the short-term risks of continuing to support Ukraine’s effort to achieve a sustainable and enduring resolution to the current Russian invasion, or it can push for a premature cessation of hostilities that greatly increases the likelihood of renewed Russian aggression on terms far more favorable to Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path forward should be clear — the West must prioritize reducing Russia’s ability to renew a war that the Kremlin is more likely to win and that would carry the same escalation risks as the current war by helping Ukraine use its position of relative advantage now to set conditions to deter future conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has a vital national security interest in averting future Russian attacks on Ukraine. Russian invasions of Ukraine inevitably harm and endanger Europe and NATO, put the US commitment to defend its NATO allies on the table, and entail the risk of conventional or nuclear escalation. America and its Western allies and partners should not accept, let alone push for, a temporary cessation of hostilities in Ukraine that increases the likelihood of a renewed Russian invasion in future years. This consideration must drive decisions about when to seek negotiated compromises and what conditions to encourage Ukraine to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US interests in ending the current war on terms that minimize the risk of future Russian invasion can be fully separated from the moral and humanitarian considerations that motivate many people to support Ukraine. American interests flow from the NATO alliance and the obligations it imposes on the US as well as to the close and vital economic interdependence of the US with Europe. Europe and NATO will be profoundly affected by a future Russian invasion of Ukraine as they have been by this one, and the US will face the same imperative to support its allies in the future as it does today. American policymakers today must focus on the imperative of resolving the current conflict in ways that do not set conditions for renewed war for our own interests, not just Ukraine’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likely durability of a cessation of hostilities rests on three fundamental questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will Russia’s objectives with respect to Ukraine, other former Soviet states, NATO, and the US change?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will the future correlation of forces favor Ukraine once the fighting stops?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will Western support for Ukraine remain firm?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to all three questions if hostilities were suspended soon is “no.” Russia’s objectives are not likely to change in the foreseeable future and must be taken as a given. The correlation of forces will begin to move away from favoring Kyiv toward favoring Moscow as soon as the fighting stops, and Western support for Ukraine will almost inevitably begin to fall. Ukraine’s position today is such that a drop in Western support and the shift in the correlation of forces will significantly increase the likelihood of a renewed Russian invasion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stable and sustainable cessation of hostilities can occur only if the West helps Ukraine use its current momentum to secure a sufficiently advantageous position from which it will be able to effectively deter a future Russian attack even as the correlation of forces changes and Western support falls. The imperative of seeking to avert a future war in Ukraine thus requires continuing to help Ukraine fight to make necessary military gains and secure necessary reconstruction assistance rather than seeking to freeze war prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s objective in launching the invasions of 2014 and then 2022 was the destruction of an independent, pro-Western Ukrainian state. His aims have increased over that period rather than moderating. His initial complaints in 2014 revolved around Ukraine’s orientation toward the West and away from Russia. Eight years later, he and his subordinates are engaged in a full-throated denial of the validity of a Ukrainian ethnicity or independent Ukrainian state. The Kremlin has clung to its demands despite battlefield defeats and its rhetoric has only become more extreme as Ukraine has turned the tide of the war against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is extremely unlikely that Putin would accept any reasonable compromise terms because of the domestic price he would likely pay for having obtained relatively little at such a great cost. Putin and those around him are also driving his maximalist position on Ukraine deep into the Kremlin’s ideology and trying to imbue the Russian population with it. There is no evidence to suggest that Putin or any Putinist successor will abandon his maximalist objectives toward Ukraine, even if he or a successor is willing to accept a temporary cessation of hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planning assumption regarding Putin’s and Russia’s objectives toward Ukraine must be that they will remain unchanged — Russia will continue to seek to subjugate Ukraine to its control fully and completely by one means or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must learn the right lesson from the period of the Minsk II Accords from 2014 to 2022. France and Germany, with US support, engaged Russia as a theoretically neutral and non-belligerent mediator in a conflict begun by a Russian invasion. They imposed on Ukraine a set of commitments that amounted to partial surrender of Kyiv’s sovereignty while demanding no formal commitments directly from Russia. They accepted the fiction that Russian proxies in Ukraine were independent of Moscow and pressed Ukraine to uphold its commitments even as the proxies continually violated theirs — and never held Moscow explicitly to account for the actions of proxies that were acting on Russia’s orders and with Russia’s direct support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accords imposed a settlement that was extremely favorable to Russia. They specifically required Ukraine to grant the Russian-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk autonomy while at the same time allowing them to participate fully in the Ukrainian political process. Such a move would have created permanent Russian levers to manipulate the Ukrainian political system throughout the country while depriving Kyiv of the ability to control Russian and Russian proxy activities in the Russian-occupied areas. The accords did not require Russia to withdraw its forces from the areas it occupied because they did not recognize that Russia had forces in those areas — even though it clearly did. The theory of the case of those in the West who supported these accords was twofold — first, that “peace” in the form of an incredibly violent and constantly-violated ceasefire was better than open warfare, and second, that the “Minsk process” would somehow, ultimately, mollify Putin and bring him to accept a new status quo highly favorable to Russia permanently. Above all the Western backers of the Minsk II Process thought that Putin was focused only or at least primarily on eastern Ukraine, whereas in fact he continued to seek to regain effective control of the entire country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumptions underlying the Minsk II Process have been utterly and completely invalidated. Russia’s proxies deliberately ensured that they never met their commitments under the accords and so made it almost impossible for Ukraine to meet its commitments. The proxies were not out of Russia’s control — they were pursuing Putin’s aims. Because Putin was never satisfied with Minsk II — he wanted more, and he used his proxies to try to renegotiate the accords by force. When that effort failed, he invaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burden on those who would argue that any agreement between Russia and Ukraine today would not follow a similar path toward renewed Russian invasion is enormous. It is almost impossible, in fact, to see how one could persuasively make such an argument given Russian actions and rhetoric over nearly all of Putin’s tenure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must instead accept as a planning assumption that Putin will continue to try to renegotiate by force any limited compromise agreement made now, up to and including through renewed Russian full-scale invasion if and when he or his successor decides that circumstances are propitious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That consideration then raises the question of the likely trajectory of the correlation of forces between Russia and Ukraine. Some advocates of negotiations now point to the fact that Ukrainian leverage at the moment is high because of Kyiv’s battlefield successes and Western support, on the one hand, and Russia’s struggles and relative isolation, on the other. If negotiations conducted at a moment of high leverage could yield a permanent resolution of conflict, then such an approach can make sense. But if, as in the present case, a negotiated settlement can only be expected to generate a temporary respite, then this approach makes sense only if we can expect the future correlation of forces to favor Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That consideration, in turn, requires a closer examination of the factors that have given Ukraine relatively high leverage at the moment. The key factors are the rallying of Ukrainians behind a full mobilization for war and high levels of Western support, on the one hand, and the catastrophically bad performance of the Russian military and Russian defense industry on the other. None of those factors is likely to change in the next six-to-twelve months if the fighting continues. All of them are likely to change rapidly and to Ukraine’s disadvantage once a ceasefire takes hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainians remain willing to support full national mobilization because they are fighting a war for the survival of their state and people. They know that if they stop fighting, Russian troops will drive deeper into their country and inflict horrors on them, ultimately overthrowing their government and subjugating them. But full mobilization is extraordinarily painful. It will be unsustainable once the immediate threat of defeat is removed. Ukraine will have to demobilize partially and attempt to rebuild, greatly reducing its combat power. The Ukrainian government will be under pressure to do sustain a strong enough military to defend against future Russian invasion and reconstruct a vibrant and prosperous economy. Ukraine is not wealthy enough to do both of those things well, particularly if it must lose much of the territory Russia currently occupies, so it will likely suboptimize both. It will likely seek to stabilize a smaller but higher-quality military while satisfying the economic demands of its people. Ukraine’s organic military capacity will thus drop significantly following a ceasefire, possibly increasing again gradually as more sustainable military practices take hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine’s current military power-driven leverage is temporarily high because of full mobilization, Russia’s is temporarily low because of the series of stupid decisions made by Putin and his generals before and during this war. Putin did not mobilize for this war. He did not put Russia’s defense industry on a war footing. He did not prepare his people for war. He did not even prepare his military for war. Once his initial assumptions about the ease of this invasion were falsified he took many months to order the reserve mobilization he should have ordered at once. But he ordered even that mobilization without adequate preparation or warning, and it, too, became a mess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces would have benefitted enormously from a months-long cessation of hostilities or even relaxation of the demand for offensive operations. Any such protracted operational or strategic pause would have given them time to reorganize, refit, and prepare for renewed offensive operations on much better terms. Putin gave them no such time, instead whipping his generals to constant offensives that simply ground the remaining combat power of the Russian military into dust. Putin did not allow his military to concentrate the mobilized reservists into coherent units that could be massed to achieve decisive battlefield effects, but instead demanded that they be hurled into combat piecemeal and unprepared, frittering away yet another opportunity to regain the initiative. All these dynamics continue to this day — the Russian military is consuming combat power as fast as it can be generated and is trying to draw on a defense industrial base only slowly and haltingly creaking into gear and badly hampered by international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net effect of Putin’s bad decisions has been to reduce Russia’s effective combat power to a level far below what Russia could in principle generate. Russia’s military weakness is thus very likely temporary. As soon as the fighting stops the Russian military can begin to reconstitute itself. Lessons can be learned. Bad organization can be rectified. Its defense industry can start to come online and replace essential kit, especially if sanctions are lifted even partially — and it is very hard to imagine Putin accepting any ceasefire that does not include some significant sanctions relief. Conscription and training systems can be improved. Russia can start to generate the kind of military power its population, industrial base, and military organization have the potential to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A protracted ceasefire will thus likely allow Russia to restore the correlation of forces between itself and Ukraine that is the natural result of the countries’ relative sizes and economic capacities — in other words, Russia will likely regain its inherent military advantages over Ukraine in the years following a ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western support to Ukraine is the key factor in this equation. Russia can regain military superiority over Ukraine, but it cannot establish military superiority over Ukraine backed by the West. So the final question is this: Will Western support for Ukraine increase, decrease, or remain the same following a ceasefire? The answer is obvious: it will decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western support today is driven partly by Russian actions and partly by the heroic and effective resistance of Ukrainians in the face of initially overwhelming military odds and then the atrocities Russian forces continue to commit. The Russian military continues offensive operations to conquer Ukrainian territory. It uses brutal tactics against the Ukrainian military and is conducting war crimes on a scale amounting to crimes against humanity. It is deliberately targeting Ukrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure while conducting ethnic cleansing operations using genocidal rhetoric. Russia has created a massive humanitarian and refugee crisis that obviously demands urgent responses. At the same time Ukrainian forces have fought back bravely and brilliantly, defeating the Russian drive on Kyiv, liberating Kharkiv in a stunning and rapid counteroffensive, and most recently pushing Russian troops out of western Kherson. These factors more than any others have kept Western support for Ukraine strong and created a political environment in most Western states that makes abandoning Ukraine highly unpopular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those dynamics will begin to change rapidly once the fighting stops. Attention will turn to reconstruction, which is inherently far less popular. Reconstruction is also inherently political and will focus attention on Ukrainian domestic politics and the natural and historic limitations of Ukrainian governance effectiveness. Domestic tensions within Ukraine will naturally grow as various groups argue for differential distributions of reconstruction aid and more normal politics returns with all its strife and messiness. Russia’s inherent skill in manipulating the information space, overwhelmed during the fighting by Russia’s failures and brutality, will begin to shape perceptions more effectively once more. The current veneer of near-universal support for Ukraine will vanish, and arguments about how and even whether to continue to support Ukraine will become much more prominent throughout the West. Both military and economic aid to Ukraine will certainly decrease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a few years of the cessation of hostilities, therefore, the following conditions are extremely likely to hold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian military power will be lower than it is now&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian military power will be greater than it is now and rising&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western military support for Ukraine will be lower&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western economic support for Ukraine will be insufficient and dropping&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;General Western enthusiasm for supporting Ukraine will be lower&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internal Ukrainian cohesion will be lower&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s aims toward Ukraine and the US will remain unchanged&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western leaders and Ukrainians should not simply accept these forecasts as givens, of course. Western political leaders should fight hard to sustain Western support for Ukraine, continuing to make the real and urgent case for defending the West’s interests by helping Ukraine rebuild and deter future Russian invasions. Ukrainians should also fight to rebuild as cohesive a state and society as they can, as well as to sustain the strongest defense posture possible in their post-conflict economic and social conditions. But a sober forecast based on normal historical trends and patterns requires assuming that such efforts will be at best partially acceptable, and future policy should be based on pessimistic sobriety rather than hopeful optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One obvious conclusion follows from these observations: Any territory Ukraine does not retake now will likely be lost to it indefinitely. The de facto borders of Ukraine at a ceasefire in the near term will be the maximum territorial extent of the Ukrainian state for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must also recognize that the risks of escalation driving the current push to press Ukraine to make concessions will be just as real whenever Russia renews the attack. Russia will always be a nuclear power. It will always be able to attack NATO with conventional or nuclear forces. Those facts will not be changed by a ceasefire now. If Putin or his successor concludes after a few years of rebuilding that he can try to conquer Ukraine again, NATO will face exactly the same risks then that some are now seeking to avoid by driving Kyiv to concessions. Those concessions will only have made the renewed invasion and return of escalation risks more likely while weakening Ukraine’s ability to deter and defeat another massive attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important conclusion to draw from all these reflections, however, is this: Ukraine’s power and Western support for Ukraine is at or near its peak and can remain there only as long as fighting continues and Ukraine continues to make gains. Both will likely begin to drop rapidly once fighting is halted or conditions of real stalemate descend. Russia’s diminishing power and influence, on the other hand, will likely begin to rise when active combat stops. Success for Ukraine and the West lies in ensuring that Ukraine has secured territorial gains, military capabilities, and economic and reconstruction support while it is at or near its peak that are all great enough to deter a recovering Russia from restarting the war even as Ukraine’s power and Western support drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine should not cash in the leverage it might have now to secure a temporary cessation of hostilities that will leave it in a far more vulnerable condition that will invite future Russian aggression, therefore. Kyiv and its Western supporters, rather, should reinforce Ukraine’s current advantages to consolidate Ukraine’s position during the fighting so that Ukraine — and peace — can survive the inevitable erosion of Kyiv’s current advantages after the conflict’s end.&lt;/p&gt;

ISIS is gradually increasing its attack capabilities in northeastern Syria and will use these capabilities to continue freeing imprisoned members and absorbing expertise and personnel in preparation for a larger resurgence. The group will attempt to exploit weaknesses in US-supported SDF counterinsurgency efforts to create sanctuaries. ISIS will use new sanctuaries to mount larger and more sophisticated attacks to degrade the SDF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Islamic State in Iraq and al Sham is increasing its attack capabilities in northeastern Syria.&lt;/strong&gt; ISIS has increased its use of vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs), a capability that requires robust logistics. ISIS’s VBIED use surged during two recent periods, indicating that the group’s attack capabilities are strengthening. The first surge occurred between September 2021 and January 2022. ISIS used five VBIEDs — two of them successful — during this period. The first surge also points to an increase in capability compared to early 2021, when ISIS only mounted motorcycle-borne improvised explosive device (MBIED) attacks in northeast Syria. The second surge occurred in September 2022. ISIS built at least four VBIEDs and one MBIED — employing one VBIED and one MBIED successfully — during the second surge. The group’s ability to construct a similar number of VBIEDs in a shorter time frame indicates a capability increase compared to the first surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISIS likely used freed fighters and redeployed some preexisting cells to conduct its VBIED surges. ISIS moved fighters from the Syrian desert back to Iraq and northeastern Syria in 2021, contributing to the first VBIED surge in September 2021. ISIS’s January 2022 al Sina’a prison attack freed at least 300 fighters. This prison break likely increased organizational capacity, allowing ISIS to begin a second VBIED surge in September 2022. ISIS also appointed a new Iraqi-born emir in the central Syrian desert in 2022 who was freed during the al Sina’a prison break. The need to reintegrate freed fighters into ISIS’s organizational structure in northeastern Syria may explain the time lag between the prison break and the September VBIED surge. ISIS will continue its effort to free sympathizers and fighters. The group’s attack attempt against al Hol internally displaced people (IDP) camp in September 2022 likely sought to free cells and sympathizers, though a successful attack would also have propaganda value by freeing ISIS families and protecting women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISIS’s predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), used VBIED capabilities to free imprisoned fighters and improve the quality of its attack cells.&lt;/strong&gt; AQI prison breaks in 2012 strengthened the group’s capabilities in Iraq. AQI prison breaks likely led to its ability to conduct major VBIED “waves” targeting Iraqi population centers in 2012–13. ISIS today is weaker than AQI was in 2012–13, but ISIS is likely using prison breaks to resuscitate some capabilities. Recent prison breaks and smaller escapes likely improve ISIS’s capabilities by providing experienced fighters for the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria in 2022 is less permissive for ISIS than Iraq was in 2011–13. AQI was capable of repeated spectacular attacks targeting civilians in Iraqi cities. AQI used 30 VBIEDs on one day in July 2012, a number far beyond ISIS’s current capabilities in Syria. ISIS does not have the freedom of movement or access to funding required to conduct VBIED attacks at AQI’s 2012–13 rate. ISIS also does not have the same organizational capacity AQI had in 2013. AQI had “reconstituted as a military force” with a “force-level planning cell” that could “task VBIEDs to support a complex, specialized operation” by 2013, while ISIS is a “low-level insurgency” in 2022. There is also greater counterterrorism pressure on ISIS in 2022 compared to that on AQI in 2011–13. The SDF receives greater US support than did Iraq during 2011–13, and the SDF may be more effective than the Iraqi Security Forces were between 2011–13. US special operations forces and air support limited the ISIS prison break at al Sina’a in January 2022. Tribes continue to facilitate US and SDF counterterrorism operations by providing intelligence, despite the risks posed to them by ISIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISIS will likely pursue a similar strategy to the one that enabled its predecessor’s resurgence in Iraq in 2011, despite a less permissive environment in Syria today. ISIS is at a very early stage in its resurgence, and it will likely pursue its strategy at a slower rate than AQI did after 2008. AQI sowed division between the government and local population in Sunni areas of Iraq in 2011–13 by targeting tribal “awakening” fighters who successfully rolled back Iraqi counterterrorism gains against al Qaeda in Iraq between 2007 and 2011. ISIS is emulating this effort by attempting to turn SDF-controlled territory into “areas of fear and terror” by assassinating members of the SDF and its allies “at will” to create panic. ISIS is also using Syria’s desert as a sanctuary where it can rebuild its capabilities, similar to AQI use of rural areas in Iraq after 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISIS’s increased logistical and operational capacity will allow it to intensify its efforts to target detention facilities.&lt;/strong&gt; ISIS’s IED manufacturing sites and major weapons depots ISIS possesses a logistical apparatus that will allow it to conduct further attacks against detention facilities or other high-value targets. ISIS is likely also capable of generating intelligence using SDF and local informants to facilitate attacks and prison breaks. The SDF’s capture of a major weapons depot near Tel Hamis in September 2022 could temporarily stop some attacks, but VBIED attacks are likely to resume unless the SDF arrests the VBIED cell and its more permanent assets, such as manufacturing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The SDF’s counter-ISIS operations and new security measures around detention facilities have not removed the threat ISIS poses to these facilities.&lt;/strong&gt; The SDF’s failure to secure areas surrounding prisons in northeastern Syria will allow ISIS to continue attack attempts aimed at freeing prisoners. The SDF did move “approximately half” of ISIS detainees to “more secure facilities.” The Defense Intelligence Agency, however, reported in May 2022 that many of the same vulnerabilities that enabled the January 2022 al Sina’a prison attack persist at the prison. ISIS VBIED and sleeper cells likely remain active near major detention sites, such as al Hol IDP Camp and al Sina’a prison. ISIS used sleeper cells and VBIEDs staged nearby to conduct the al Sina’a attack in January 2022. These cells fixed SDF forces in place and prevented SDF units from responding to the al Sina’a attack, increasing the ability of ISIS fighters to escape. In Raqqa, ISIS sleeper cells are likely intentionally “lying low” to avoid US and SDF pressure. The group attempted two prison breaks in Raqqa in fall 2022, and it could use sleeper cells to launch future attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The SDF will prioritize confronting Turkish military activity over counter-ISIS operations.&lt;/strong&gt; Turkey is targeting the SDF with air strikes and threatening a ground incursion in northern Syria. Another Turkish incursion will distract the SDF and cause the SDF to decrease its counterterrorism pressure on ISIS. The SDF’s spokesperson said the group could not deter Turkish attacks and fight ISIS simultaneously and stopped counter-ISIS operations on November 23, though the SDF resumed joint patrols with US forces on December 2. Lifting SDF counterterrorism pressure will provide an opening for ISIS to prepare attacks against key facilities, such as al Hol IDP camp. A Turkish air strike on November 23 near al Hol targeted an SDF base. The air strike did not target al Hol itself, but air strikes against SDF security near al Hol distracts SDF forces tasked with securing al Hol’s surroundings. This could allow ISIS to exploit opportunities to target high-value facilities such as al Hol or other prisons in northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even without a significant Turkish incursion, ISIS will take advantage of the SDF’s counterproductive counterterrorism approach. The current SDF approach relies on mass arrests, counterterrorism raids, and destruction of property. These tactics contribute to popular grievances, which are key to a renewed insurgency. ISIS can recruit through detention centers after mass arrests and encourage retaliation against the SDF for counterterrorism raids and property destruction. ISIS is often able to maintain its presence in areas subject to SDF raids and arrests. ISIS reportedly “owns the night” in areas of northeast Syria and threatens to kill SDF employees for their cooperation with the SDF. The SDF’s approach actively worsens core grievances among the local communities, such as reconstruction and a lack of services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISIS could undermine the SDF by sowing division between Arab communities and the SDF in northeastern Syria. The group will aim to expand from desert sanctuaries and attempt to create support zones by assassinating and intimidating SDF civilian and military employees, tribal dignitaries, and other local civilians.[1] The SDF’s counterterrorism approach is overly reliant on mass arrests, while its fails to protect its employees and civilian populations. These shortcomings could drive local communities to support ISIS and provide sanctuary to the group. Poor security and governance already created tension between the SDF and local communities in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Division between the SDF and locals will allow ISIS to use its presence in northeastern Syria to limit the SDF’s freedom of movement and gradually reimpose its governance in areas of northeastern Syria. ISIS has successfully fixed the SDF in place during certain operations, such as the al Sina’a prison break. Increased ISIS capabilities could make a similar effort more successful in the future. Fixing the SDF in place or isolating specific bases could cause the SDF to vacate some areas if SDF reinforcements cannot protect outposts or smaller bases in ISIS attack zones. SDF bases and outposts allow the SDF to protect the surrounding areas. The SDF may also become less capable of targeting ISIS cells as local communities lose faith in the SDF’s security. Local activists in Deir Ezzor said SDF raids sometimes target innocent civilians due to faulty intelligence. Decreased SDF presence and capability would allow ISIS to reimpose its governance gradually in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISIS could strengthen quickly should conditions change, causing Syria to become more permissive for ISIS. The SDF remains reliant on US intelligence support to enable operations, though SDF intelligence collection and exploitation is improving. A US withdrawal could decrease the SDF’s effectiveness by ending US intelligence and logistical support. ISIS could use decreased pressure to strengthen capabilities such as VBIED manufacturing and local recruitment. These capabilities would allow ISIS to mount sophisticated attacks against SDF military positions and detention sites. ISIS is capable of generating funds through smuggling and forced zakat collection. The group could expand these efforts further if competing priorities distract the SDF. Finally, increased ISIS intelligence collection and exploitation may allow ISIS to assassinate and intimidate local leaders to cooperate with ISIS, to the detriment of the SDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The death of ISIS’s leader in mid-October is unlikely to change ISIS’s trajectory in northeastern Syria.&lt;/strong&gt; Local Syrian armed groups killed ISIS’s leader in southern Syria on October 17. The al Sina’a prison break in January 2022 was likely the last major operation planned by ISIS’s overall leader. ISIS’s emir in northeastern Syria likely has both the authority and resources required to plan and conduct complex attacks against high-value targets in northeastern Syria. An Iraqi militant freed from al Sina’a in January 2022 leads ISIS in the central Syrian desert. His time in al Sina’a indicates he may have significant experience within ISIS before 2019 and may be able to assist planning efforts. ISIS cells in the central Syrian desert likely support ISIS activity in northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Carter</name></author><summary type="html">Turkish military activity in Syria will accelerate the strengthening of the ISIS in Iraq and al Sham.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/UGy5lgb.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/UGy5lgb.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Taiwan Long Game</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-12-02-the-taiwan-long-game.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Taiwan Long Game" /><published>2022-12-02T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-12-02T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/the-taiwan-long-game</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-12-02-the-taiwan-long-game.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For 70 years, China and the United States have managed to avoid disaster over Taiwan. But a consensus is forming in U.S. policy circles that this peace may not last much longer.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Many analysts and policymakers now argue that the United States must use all its military power to prepare for war with China in the Taiwan Strait. In October 2022, Mike Gilday, the head of the U.S. Navy, warned that China might be preparing to invade Taiwan before 2024. Members of Congress, including Democratic Representative Seth Moulton and Republican Representative Mike Gallagher, have echoed Gilday’s sentiment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are sound rationales for the United States to focus on defending Taiwan. The U.S. military is bound by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to maintain the capacity to resist the use of force or coercion against Taiwan. Washington also has strong strategic, economic, and moral reasons to stand firm on behalf of the island. As a leading democracy in the heart of Asia, Taiwan sits at the core of global value chains. Its security is a fundamental interest for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, however, Washington faces a strategic problem with a defense component, not a military problem with a military solution. The more the United States narrows its focus to military fixes, the greater the risk to its own interests, as well as to those of its allies and Taiwan itself. War games held in the Pentagon and in Washington think tanks, meanwhile, risk diverting focus from the sharpest near-term threats and challenges that Beijing presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sole metric on which U.S. policy should be judged is whether it helps preserve peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait — not whether it solves the question of Taiwan once and for all or keeps Taiwan permanently in the United States’ camp. Once viewed this way, the real aim becomes clear: to convince leaders in Beijing and Taipei that time is on their side, forestalling conflict. Everything the United States does should be geared toward that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To preserve peace, the United States must understand what drives China’s anxiety, ensure that Chinese President Xi Jinping is not backed into a corner, and convince Beijing that unification belongs to a distant future. It must also develop a more nuanced understanding of Beijing’s current calculus, one that moves beyond the simplistic and inaccurate speculation that Xi is accelerating plans to invade Taiwan. Support for Taiwan should bolster not only the island’s security but also its resilience and prosperity. Assisting Taiwan will also require new U.S. investments in tools that benefit the island beyond the military realm, including a more holistic deterrence strategy to deal with Beijing’s coercive gray-zone tactics. Critics may contend that this approach sidesteps the hard questions at the root of the confrontation, but that is precisely the point: sometimes, the best policy is to avoid bringing intractable challenges to a head and kick the can down the road instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sea-change&quot;&gt;Sea Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final years of the 1945–49 Chinese Civil War, the losing Nationalists retreated to Taiwan, establishing a mutual defense treaty with the United States in 1954. In 1979, however, Washington severed those ties so it could normalize relations with Beijing. Since then, the United States has worked to keep the peace in the Taiwan Strait by blocking the two actions that could lead to outright conflict: a declaration of independence by Taipei and forced unification by Beijing. At times, the United States has reined in Taiwan when it feared the island was tacking too close to independence. In 2003, President George W. Bush stood next to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and publicly opposed “comments and actions” proposed by Taipei that the United States saw as destabilizing. At other times, the United States has flexed its military muscle in front of Beijing, as it did during the 1995–96 Taiwan Strait crisis, when U.S. President Bill Clinton sent an aircraft carrier to the waters off Taiwan in response to a series of Chinese missile tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also important to the U.S. approach have been statements of reassurance. To Taiwan, the United States has made a formal commitment under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to “preserve and promote extensive, close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and other relations” with Taiwan and to provide the island “arms of a defensive character.” To Beijing, the United States has consistently stated that it does not support Taiwan’s independence, including in its 2022 National Security Strategy. The goal was to create space for Beijing and Taipei to either indefinitely postpone conflict or reach some sort of political resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, this approach worked well, thanks to three factors. First, the United States maintained a big lead over China when it came to military power, which discouraged Beijing from using conventional force to substantially alter cross-strait relations. Second, China was focused primarily on its own economic development and integration into the global economy, allowing the Taiwan issue to stay on the back burner. Third, the United States dexterously dealt with challenges to cross-strait stability, whether they originated in Taipei or Beijing, thereby tamping down any embers that could ignite a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

▲ Celebrating National Day, Taipei, Taiwan, October 2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over at least the past decade, however, all three of these factors have evolved dramatically. Perhaps the most obvious change is that China’s military has vastly expanded its capabilities, owing to decades of rising investments and reforms. In 1995, as the United States sailed the USS Nimitz toward the Taiwan Strait, all the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) could do was watch in indignation. Since then, the power differential between the two militaries has narrowed significantly, especially in the waters off China’s shoreline. Beijing can now easily strike targets in the waters and airspace around Taiwan, hit U.S. aircraft carriers operating in the region, hobble American assets in space, and threaten U.S. military bases in the western Pacific, including those in Guam and Japan. Because the PLA has little real-world combat experience, its precise effectiveness remains to be seen. Even so, its impressive force-projection capabilities have already given Beijing confidence that in the event of conflict, it could seriously damage the United States’ and Taiwan’s forces operating around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside China’s military upgrades, Beijing is now more willing than ever to tangle with the United States and others in pursuit of its broader ambitions. Xi himself has accumulated greater power than his recent predecessors, and he appears to be more risk-tolerant when it comes to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States has abandoned any pretense of acting as a principled arbiter committed to preserving the status quo and allowing the two sides to come to their own peaceful settlement. The United States’ focus has shifted to countering the threat China poses to Taiwan. Reflecting this shift, U.S. President Joe Biden has repeatedly said that the United States would intervene militarily on behalf of Taiwan in a cross-strait conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ready-set-invade&quot;&gt;Ready, Set, Invade?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving this change in U.S. policy is a growing chorus arguing that Xi has decided to launch an invasion or enforce a blockade of Taiwan in the near future. In 2021, Admiral Philip Davidson, then the head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, predicted that Beijing might move against Taiwan “in the next six years.” That same year, the political scientist Oriana Skylar Mastro likewise contended, in Foreign Affairs, that “there have been disturbing signals that Beijing is reconsidering its peaceful approach and contemplating armed unification.” In August 2022, former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Elbridge Colby wrote, also in Foreign Affairs, that the United States must prepare for an imminent war over Taiwan. All these analyses base their judgments on China’s expanding military capabilities. But they fail to grapple with the reasons why China has not used force against Taiwan, given that it already outmatches the island in military strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its part, Beijing has stuck to the message that cross-strait relations are moving in the right direction. China’s leaders continue to tell their people that time is on their side and that the balance of power is increasingly tilting toward Beijing. In his speech at the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Beijing in October 2022, Xi declared that “peaceful reunification” remains the “best way to realize reunification across the Taiwan Strait,” and that Beijing has “maintained the initiative and the ability to steer in cross-strait relations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet at the same time, Beijing believes that the United States has all but abandoned its “one China” policy, in which Washington acknowledges China’s position that there is one China and Taiwan is a part of it. Instead, in the eyes of Beijing, the United States has begun using Taiwan as a tool to weaken and divide China. Taiwan’s internal political trends have amplified China’s anxieties. The historically pro-Beijing Kuomintang Party has been marginalized, while the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party has consolidated power. Meanwhile, public opinion in Taiwan has soured on Beijing’s preferred formula for political reconciliation, the “one country, two systems” policy, in which China rules over Taiwan but allows Taipei some room to govern itself economically and administratively. Taiwan’s public became especially skeptical of the idea beginning in 2020, when Beijing abrogated its promise to provide Hong Kong a “high degree of autonomy” until 2047 by imposing a hard-line national security law. In high-level pronouncements, Beijing has reiterated that “time and momentum” are on its side. But beneath public projections of confidence, China’s leaders likely understand that their “one country, two systems” formula has no purchase in Taiwan and that public opinion trends on the island run against their vision of greater cross-strait integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taipei has its own sense of urgency, driven by concerns over Beijing’s growing military might and the ongoing worry that U.S. support might diminish if Washington’s attention shifts elsewhere or Americans turn against overseas commitments. The new refrain from the administration of Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen — “Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow” — is both a genuine reflection of Taipei’s worries about Chinese aggression and an attempt to galvanize support that will extend beyond the current geopolitical upheaval. In other words, the one thing that Beijing, Taipei, and Washington seem to agree on is that time is working against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The United States must avoid backing China into a corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sense of urgency is to some extent grounded in fact. Beijing does have a clear and long-held ambition to annex Taiwan and has openly threatened to use military force if it concludes that the door to peaceful unification has been closed. Beijing’s protestations that the United States is no longer adhering to understandings on Taiwan are, in some cases, accurate. And for its part, Taipei is right to worry that Beijing is laying the groundwork to suffocate or seize Taiwan. But American anxieties have been intensified by sloppy analysis, including assertions that China could take advantage of the United States’ distraction in Ukraine to seize Taiwan by force or that China is operating along a fixed timeline toward military conquest. The first of these examples has been disproved by reality. The second reflects a misreading of China’s strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, there is no conclusive evidence that China is operating on a fixed timeline to seize Taiwan, and the heightened worry in Washington is driven primarily by China’s growing military capabilities rather than any indication that Xi is preparing to attack the island. According to Bill Burns, the director of the CIA, Xi has instructed his military to be prepared for conflict by 2027, and he has declared that progress on unification with Taiwan is a requirement for fulfilling the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” for which he set 2049 as the target date. But any timeline that has a target date nearly three decades in the future is little more than aspirational. Xi, like leaders everywhere, would prefer to preserve his freedom of action on matters of war and peace and not lock himself into plans from which he cannot escape. China’s leadership appears to be spending profligately to secure the option of a military solution to the Taiwan problem, and the United States and Taiwan must not be complacent. By the same token, however, it would be wrong to conclude that the future is foretold and that conflict is inescapable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixating on invasion scenarios pushes U.S. policymakers to develop solutions to the wrong near-term threats. Defense officials prefer to prepare for blockades and invasions because such scenarios line up most favorably with American capabilities and are the easiest to conceptualize and plan for. Yet it is worth recalling that Chinese leaders in the past have chosen options other than military occupation to achieve their objectives, such as building artificial islands in the South China Sea and using lawfare in Hong Kong. Indeed, Taiwan has been defending itself against a wide variety of Chinese gray-zone attacks for years, including cyberattacks, meddling in Taiwan’s electoral politics, and military exercises meant to undermine the island’s confidence in its own defenses and the credibility of U.S. support. China’s response to U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s August 2022 visit to Taiwan underlines China’s efforts to erode Taiwan’s psychological confidence in its self-defense. After the visit, Beijing lobbed missiles over Taiwan for the first time, conducted unprecedented air operations across the Taiwan Strait median line, and simulated a blockade of Taiwan’s main ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the military threat against Taiwan is real, it is not the onl — or most proximate — challenge the island faces. By focusing narrowly on military problems at the expense of other threats to Taiwan, the United States risks making two serious mistakes: first, overcompensating in ways that do more to escalate tensions than deter conflict; and second, losing sight of broader strategic problems that it is more likely to confront. Beijing is already choking Taiwan’s links to the rest of the world and attempting to persuade the people of Taiwan that their only option for avoiding devastation is to sue for peace on Beijing’s terms. This is not a future hypothetical. It is already an everyday reality. And by hyping the threat of a Chinese invasion, U.S. analysts and officials are unintentionally doing the CCP’s work for it by stoking fears in Taiwan. They are also sending signals to global companies and investors that operating in and around Taiwan brings with it a high risk of being caught in a military conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gIUxQRQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ Demonstrating in support of Pelosi’s visit, Taipei, Taiwan, August 2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mistake is to presume conflict is unavoidable. By doing so, the United States and Taiwan bind themselves to preparing in every way possible for the impending conflict, precipitating the very outcomes they seek to prevent. If the United States backs China into a corner, for example, by permanently stationing military personnel on Taiwan or making another formal mutual defense commitment with Taipei, Chinese leaders might feel the weight of nationalist pressure and take drastic actions that could devastate the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, unilaterally risking a war with the United States over Taiwan would not mesh with Xi’s grand strategy. His vision is to restore China as a leading power on the world stage and to transform China into, as he puts it, a “modern socialist nation.” The imperatives of seizing Taiwan on the one hand and asserting global leadership on the other are thus in direct tension. Any conflict over Taiwan would be catastrophic for China’s future. If Beijing moves militarily on Taiwan, it will alert the rest of the region to China’s comfort with waging war to achieve its objectives, likely triggering other Asian countries to arm and cohere to prevent Chinese domination. Invading Taiwan would also jeopardize Beijing’s access to global finance, data, and markets — ruinous for a country dependent on imports of oil, food, and semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even assuming Beijing could successfully invade and hold Taiwan, China would then face countless problems. Taiwan’s economy would be in tatters, including its globally invaluable semiconductor industry. Untold civilians would be dead or injured, and those who survived the initial conflict would be violently hostile to the invading military power. Beijing would likely face unprecedented diplomatic blowback and sanctions. Conflict just off China’s eastern shoreline would incapacitate one of the world’s busiest maritime corridors, bringing with it disastrous consequences for China’s own export-driven economy. And of course, by invading Taiwan, China would be inviting military engagement with the United States and perhaps other regional powers, including Japan. This would be the very definition of a Pyrrhic victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These realities deter China from actively considering an invasion. Xi, like all his predecessors, wants to be the leader who finally annexes Taiwan. But for more than 70 years, Beijing has concluded that the cost of an invasion remains too high, and this explains why China has instead relied largely on economic inducements, and more recently, gray-zone coercions. Far from having a well-thought-out plan to achieve unification, Beijing is, in fact, stuck in a strategic cul-de-sac. After Beijing trampled on Hong Kong’s autonomy, no one can believe that China will solve the crisis in the strait through a policy of “one country, two systems.” China’s hope that the gravitational pull of its economy would be enough to bring Taipei to the negotiating table has likewise been dashed, a victim of both Taiwan’s economic success and Xi’s economic mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An invasion of Taiwan doesn’t solve any of these problems. Xi would risk it only if he believed that he had no other options. And there are no signs that he is anywhere close to drawing such a conclusion. The United States should try to keep it this way. None of Xi’s speeches resemble the menacing ones that Russian President Vladimir Putin gave in the run-up to his invasion of Ukraine. It is impossible to rule out the chance that Xi might miscalculate or blunder into a conflict. But his statements and behavior do not indicate that he would act so recklessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hold-your-forces&quot;&gt;Hold Your Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if Xi is not yet considering forced unification, the United States must still project sure-footedness in its ability to protect its interests in the Taiwan Strait. Meanwhile, military decisions must not be allowed to define the United States’ overall approach, as many analysts and policymakers are effectively suggesting they should. The inescapable reality is that no additional increment of U.S. military power that is deployable in the next five years will fundamentally alter the military balance. The United States must rely on statecraft and a broader array of tools to make clear to Beijing the high price of using force to compel unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of a sustainable Taiwan policy should be to preserve peace and stability, with a focus on elongating Beijing’s time horizon such that it sees unification as a “some day” scenario. The United States must especially avoid backing Xi into a corner, preventing a situation in which he no longer treats Taiwan as a long-term objective but as an impending crisis. This different approach would entail an uncomfortable shift in mindset for many analysts and policymakers, who see the United States and China as locked in an inevitable showdown and view any consideration of Beijing’s sensitivities to be a dangerous concession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the goal of U.S. policy should be to avoid angering Beijing. There is no evidence that diminished U.S. support for Taiwan would reduce China’s eagerness to absorb the island, which is elemental to the founding narrative of the CCP. But this reality means that the United States should bolster Taiwan’s prosperity, security, and resilience in ways that don’t gratuitously antagonize its powerful neighbor ruled by an increasingly nationalistic leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. support should be dedicated to fortifying Taiwan’s capacity to withstand the full range of pressures the island already contends with from China: cyber, economic, informational, diplomatic, and military. But critically, the United States must be disciplined in declining Taiwan’s requests to provide symbols of sovereignty, such as renaming Taiwan’s diplomatic office in the United States, which would aggravate Beijing without improving security in the Taiwan Strait. Similarly, congressional delegations should be geared toward advancing specific objectives to ensure that benefits exceed costs. The United States should channel its support for Taiwan into areas that concretely address vulnerabilities, such as by helping Taiwan diversify trade flows, acquire asymmetric defensive weapons systems, and stockpile food, fuel, medicine, and munitions that it would need in a crisis. It is a comforting illusion that the solution to cross-strait tensions lies in simply strengthening the military capabilities of Taiwan and the United States such that Beijing decides that it must stand aside and let Taiwan go its own way. In reality, Beijing would not sit idly by as the defense capabilities of the United States and Taiwan grow ever stronger. Indeed, the demonstration of U.S. naval power during the 1995–96 Taiwan Strait crisis had the unintended consequence of provoking a wave of new PLA investments that have eroded U.S. military dominance. Current efforts by Taipei or Washington to prepare for military conflict should account for the PLA’s predictable reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The very idea that “strategic clarity” is “clear” is a myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any approach to maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait must begin with understanding how deeply political the issue of Taiwan is for China. It is noteworthy that the 1995–96 Taiwan Strait crisis and the recent spike in tensions over Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan were driven by issues of high political visibility — not by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan or efforts to back Taipei in international organizations or initiatives to strengthen bilateral economic ties. The lesson is that the United States has more room to concretely support Taiwan when it focuses on substance rather than publicly undercutting Beijing’s core domestic narrative that China is making progress toward unification. Chinese authorities will inevitably grumble about quieter efforts, such as expanding defense dialogues between the United States and Taiwan, but these remain below the threshold of public embarrassment for Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, U.S. actions should both meaningfully support Taiwan and give Xi domestic space to proclaim that a path remains open to eventual unification. Examples of such efforts include deepening coordination between the United States and Taiwan on supply chain resilience, diversifying Taiwan’s trade through negotiation of a bilateral trade agreement, strengthening public health coordination, making more asymmetric defensive weapons available to Taiwan, and pooling resources to accelerate innovations on emerging technologies such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence applications. All such efforts would strengthen Taiwan’s capacity to provide for the health, safety, and prosperity of its people without publicly challenging Beijing’s narrative of eventual unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the United States must back its policy with a credible military posture in the Indo-Pacific, placing greater emphasis on small, dispersed weapons systems in the region and making larger investments in long-range antisurface and antiship missile systems. Such investments could bolster the United States’ ability to deny China opportunities to secure quick military gains on Taiwan. And if the United States sends weapons in a low-key manner, it will frustrate Beijing but leave little room for China to justify the use of force as an appropriate response. In other words, the United States should do more and say less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also resist viewing the Taiwan problem as a contest between authoritarianism and democracy, as some officials in Taipei have urged. Such a framework is understandable, especially in the wake of Russia’s disastrous invasion of Ukraine. It is easier to convince Americans of the value of a safe and prosperous Taiwan when contrasting its liberal democratic identity with Beijing’s deepening autocratic slide. Yet this approach misdiagnoses the problem. The growing challenge to maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait stems not from the nature of China’s political system — which has always been deeply illiberal and unapologetically Leninist — but from its increasing ability to project power, combined with the consolidation of power around Xi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/G8XGSYK.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ Footage of PLA military exercises, Beijing, August 2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more troubling, this approach boxes Washington in. If the United States paints cross-strait relations with bright ideological lines, it will hinder U.S. policymakers in making nuanced choices in gray areas. As American game theorist Thomas Schelling demonstrated, deterring an adversary requires a blend of credible threats and credible assurances. The assurance requires convincing Beijing that if it refrains from using force, then the United States will hold off on supporting Taiwan’s independence. When U.S. policy on Taiwan becomes infused with ideology, the credibility of American assurances diminishes, and the United States’ willingness to offer assurances to China becomes proscribed. Taking Beijing’s concerns into consideration may not fit the hawkish Zeitgeist in Washington, but this type of strategic empathy is imperative for anticipating an opponent’s calculus and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Framing tensions as an ideological struggle risks backing China into a corner, too, because it feeds Beijing’s anxieties that the United States will stand in permanent opposition to any type of resolution to the Taiwan problem. This, in turn, might lead Beijing to conclude that its only choice is to exploit its military strength to override the United States’ opposition and forcibly subsume the island, even at significant economic and political cost. Any Chinese leader would consider Taiwan’s escape from China’s grasp an existential loss. Biden’s comments in September 2022 that the United States would come to Taiwan’s defense if China were to launch an “unprecedented attack” have again sharpened the debate on whether U.S. policy is shifting toward a clearer articulation of when and how it would intervene on Taiwan’s behalf. Yet this debate over “strategic clarity” is a distraction. For one thing, the Chinese military already assumes that the United States would intervene if China were to launch an all-out invasion, so from Beijing’s perspective, U.S. involvement is already factored into military plans. Moreover, in the absence of a mutual defense treaty between the United States and Taiwan, which is not on the table, there is no binding requirement for Washington to intervene, even if a president has suggested that it should do so. What’s more, an outright and unprovoked invasion by the PLA is the least likely scenario the United States will encounter, and so the way in which the United States responds to Beijing’s aggression would inevitably depend on the specific circumstances of a Chinese attack. In this sense, the very idea that “strategic clarity” is “clear” is a myth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More important than rehashing a decades-old debate over strategic clarity is to focus on how the United States’ “one China” policy should be adapted to meet the new and pressing challenges presented by a vastly more powerful and aggressive China. Simply stating that U.S. policy has not shifted, as the White House did following Biden’s remarks, rings hollow to Beijing and to any honest observer of U.S. policy over the past six years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;balancing-act&quot;&gt;Balancing Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than perpetuate the fiction of constancy, the United States should tell the truth: its decisions are guided by a determination to keep the peace in the Taiwan Strait, and if Beijing intensifies pressure on Taipei, Washington will adjust its posture accordingly. And the United States should pledge that it will do the same if Taiwan pursues symbolic steps that erode cross-strait conditions. Such an approach would recognize that the status quo in the Taiwan Strait is dynamic, not fixed. It would recognize Beijing’s agency in either sustaining or undermining peace. Washington should make it clear that if Beijing or Taipei upsets stability in the strait, it would seek to reestablish the equilibrium. But for such an approach to work, the actions and intentions of the United States must be clear, and its commitment to this equilibrium must be credible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should be firm and consistent in declaring that it will accept any resolution to cross-strait tensions that is reached peacefully and in accordance with the views of Taiwan’s people. If Xi wants to find a peaceful path to unification, which he and other Chinese leaders still stress is their preference, then he must sell this option to Taiwan’s public. The truth is that such a reconciliation may not come for decades, if ever. But it is nonetheless worth pursuing a peace that allows Taiwan to grow and prosper in a stable regional environment, even if such a goal does not have the sense of finality that many American analysts and policymakers crave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After half a decade of deterioration, the U.S.-Chinese relationship stands at the edge of crisis. Bilateral frictions have moved from trade to technology and, now, to the threat of direct military confrontation. To be sure, Beijing’s threats toward Taiwan are the fundamental cause of the tensions across the strait. But this blunt fact only serves to highlight just how vital it is for the United States to act with foresight, resolve, and dexterity. A direct confrontation between the United States and China would wreak devastation for generations. Success will be measured by each day that the people of Taiwan continue to live in safety and prosperity and enjoy political autonomy. The fundamental objectives of American efforts must be to preserve peace and stability, strengthen Taiwan’s confidence in its future, and credibly demonstrate to Beijing that now is not the time to force a violent confrontation. Achieving these objectives requires elongating timelines, not bringing an intractable challenge to a head. Wise statecraft, more than military strength, offers the best path to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

The vastness of the region is not fully captured in two dimensions: the Arctic Circle spreads across roughly 14.5 million square kilometers, a greater area than any country save Russia.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;This fact is not only trivia; it has serious implications for the well-being of the communities who live there, the militaries who monitor it, and the scientists who seek to better predict the coming global impacts of climate change. To perform their functions well, each of these actors seeks tools to compensate for or overcome these vast distances, as well as the harsh environment that makes sustained presence in the Arctic so challenging. Increasingly, these communities — some of which have been in the Arctic for decades, and others for centuries — are coming to understand that artificial intelligence may be essential to monitor the region and predict changes within it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this edition of Northern Connections, the authors tackle the implications of this new tool for national security and climate research. Both pieces illustrate how governments, scientists, and Indigenous communities can use artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) to better understand key Arctic problem sets, particularly those that involve parsing either a massive amount of data or complex and shifting future scenarios. At the same time, both note that AI/ML, while holding immense potential, remains not entirely proven. In some cases, a lack of funding hinders a robust deployment of AI/ML; in others, it must compete with more established and orthodox methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first essay, Lieutenant Commander Michael Bielby of the Canadian Armed Forces lays out Canada’s incipient efforts to use AI/ML for its domain awareness mission in the far north. He explains the unique physical challenges of the region and the insufficiency of using only crewed resources to monitor it, given the finiteness of those assets and the vast distances involved. Passive and active sensors are the means to compensate for this reality, but as Lt. Commander Bielby notes, this creates a new problem: a “deluge” of data where it is not always possible for human operators to distinguish quickly (enough) between what might be an adversary vessel and what might simply be natural debris. He argues that AI/ML may well be the answer to this riddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second contributor is Dr. Lillian “Doc” Alessa, an Arctic and intelligence expert and a member of the National Climate Assessment Team. Dr. Alessa interrogates the applicability of AI/ML for researching the thaw of Arctic permafrost, which underlies 25 percent of the Northern Hemisphere. The rate at which climate change causes this permafrost to melt has serious consequences for not only local Arctic communities, but the entire world. Dr. Alessa argues that, especially if paired with the knowledge of those local communities, AI-generated models will allow policymakers to better understand permafrost thaw as well as test different scenarios of melting against various tactics for intervention or adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A responsibility of every state is to exercise its sovereignty through the protection of its defined territory from intrusions by foreign states. For that to happen, the state must understand what is happening within those physical spaces. It must have domain awareness. For a number of reasons, this becomes extremely challenging in far northern regions. In recent years, Canada and other Arctic states are increasingly considering how to develop and deploy AI/ML tools to address this domain awareness challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 40 percent of Canada’s land mass, roughly 3.5 million km2, lies north of 60° north latitude. As with most inhabited Arctic regions in North America, Europe, and Russia, it is scarcely populated — in Canada’s case, fewer than 120,000 people, or less than one person per approximately 26 km2. Understandably, it is very difficult to generate the requisite level of domain awareness necessary for the state to exercise sovereignty in this remote territory. The obvious solution is to start generating that awareness before state actors can breach territorial boundaries — in other words, to detect them at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This introduces a whole new problem set, as Canada’s exclusive economic zone north of 60° encompasses approximately 4 million km2. The economic and logistical feasibility of monitoring such a vast area using crewed resources would be taxing enough, but the task of generating maritime domain awareness becomes financially and logistically untenable when considering the inhospitable climate of the Canadian north, a lack of suitable extant infrastructure, and the fact that infrastructure development projects are plagued by supply chain issues and a shortened building season. To further exacerbate the issue, the finite crewed resources suitable to conduct this mission are also required to deliver similar strategic effects on overseas missions. As such, the only viable option, at this time, for Canada becomes the employment of space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (SB-ISR) capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the various factors that complicate maritime activity in northern waters — such as sea state (high sea states result in sea spray and accumulation of ice on the upper decks in sub-zero temperatures, which can affect ship stability and potentially result in a ship sinking or capsizing), icebergs, and the varying constructions of vessels plying those waters — no single SB-ISR sensor type is a panacea. An active sensor may detect the signal return off an object (e.g., metal reflect signals better than fiberglass) but cannot necessarily differentiate between a ship and a bergy bit, and passive sensors can be defeated simply by turning off an emitter. Therefore, a mix of active and passive sensors ensures a greater probability of detecting contacts. However, in solving one problem, another is created: multiple sensor feeds create massive amounts of positional data. The result is that Arctic operators drown in the deluge of data from SB-ISR sensors while starving for domain awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the deluge of data is framed as a big data issue, there are four variables to consider: volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. Maritime positional data from various sensor feeds for the approaches to North America and the Arctic exceeds tens of millions of reports daily (volume), is received in a variety of structured and unstructured reporting formats (variety), and arrives continuously (velocity). System operators are not able to keep up with the velocity of the data flow from SB-ISR sensors while performing the necessary quality-control functions (veracity) while also monitoring for anomalous behavior as bad actors attempt to exploit various interstitial gray areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to correlate the volume and variety of data at the velocity in which it is received is through the adoption of AI/ML. This technology will not only solve the operators’ problems but, at machine-to-machine speeds, will be able to cross-cue additional sensors based on the data received, thereby improving the probability of achieving positive identification and subsequent domain awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) is still somewhat of a newcomer to the adoption and implementation of AI/ML to support maritime domain awareness. However, the Royal Canadian Navy’s Innovation Team recently trialed an advanced maritime domain awareness software that uses AI/ML to detect surface vessel traffic acting unusually. In addition, the Royal Canadian Air Force, as the CAF Functional Authority for space, has factored AI/ML requirements into many of the SB-ISR projects currently under way. Given the complexities of the approval process for CAF projects, the implementation of many of these solutions is still a few years off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interim, the CAF’s most effective AI/ML mitigating strategy has been the reinvigoration of multinational partnerships, such as the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, and the (re)establishment of information-sharing agreements among allied nations and partner departments within the Canadian government. Once the data is shared, recipients can process it and notify the broader operational community of any indications and warnings of anomalous behavior. Within national chains of command, or in accordance with extant multinational treaties, this then allows platforms such as aircraft, ships, and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) to be tasked to conduct ISR missions against specific targets. This is a more efficient use of limited resources for known high-value targets and for missions of national importance. However, the weakness in this strategy is revealed in situations where the military is dealing with contacts that have not been positively identified and whose value is unknown. In such cases, the competition against other national interests and departmental priorities for the allocation of scarce resources makes it difficult to justify ISR missions. This is why this multinational approach, while useful, remains an interim solution at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more that countries depend on SB-ISR in the vast and remote high north to aid in the exercising of sovereignty, the more likely Arctic operators are to drown in a deluge of big data. In the long term, investing in the development of robust AI/ML capabilities that can be employed in the region is the only way for Arctic states to turn big data into domain awareness and ensure their sovereignty is protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the population of the Arctic is only around 4 million people, the region has global significance due to its strategic geography, exploitable natural resources, and rapid rate of climate and environmental change (CEC). It also contains permafrost, which is ground that remains below 0°C for two or more consecutive years, making it frozen and a largely stable foundation for the active layer, which supports above-ground flora, fauna, and built infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous (deep) and discontinuous (shallow) permafrost comprises a full 25 percent of the Northern Hemisphere, and current estimates suggest that between 30 and 85 percent of current subsurface permafrost will thaw within a century, depending on global temperature increases. While permafrost thaw is often thought of as a future phenomenon, it has been changing rapidly for roughly the past 40 years. The effects can be readily seen in natural terrain and built infrastructure, where degradation is ultimately placing at risk roughly $15.5 billion in civil infrastructure in the United States alone, much of which supports the defense enterprise. Furthermore, given that permafrost covers approximately 65 percent of the Russian Arctic, it is necessary to understand, with exquisite precision, where and when changes to Russia’s infrastructure will result in opportunities to gain strategic advantage by improving the Department of Defense’s own resilience to a highly variable operating environment. Understanding the complex dynamics of permafrost thaw and its effects on strategic activities such as defense and security requires leveraging all available tools, particularly AI/ML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea bucks a deep-seated tradition in Arctic research, where field research is synonymous with the golden era of exploration. However, field research places significant burdens on local communities and funding agencies, which incur high costs for increasingly low returns on investments. Especially when combined with the deep pools of local and place-based knowledge of Indigenous peoples, new tools such as AI/ML are a better means to improve U.S. and allied resilience to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the concept of resilience in Arctic defense is poorly articulated. It is a term often overused and thrown around in strategic intents and policies, holding different meanings for different interest groups. Here it is defined as the ability of three types of integrated systems — (1) social (people, including their cultures and perceptions); (2) ecological (the natural environments in which they live); and (3) technological (the tools and structures used by human organizations) — to maintain desired functions despite climate change. To be achieved, Arctic resilience in this context must include the social elements of cultures and human behavior. Given the many variables and their complicated interactions, it is more critical than ever that social and societal systems be incorporated into permafrost science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI/ML promises to yield the needed insights in time to be proactive and adapt successfully to the unprecedented rate of CEC. A holy grail for permafrost researchers, geopolitical strategists, and military planners alike is the development of data-driven scenarios within which it is possible to forecast potential early warnings of threats and opportunities to guide proactive interventions. AI/ML permits the user to take known interactions of variables (i.e., rule sets) within academic disciplines and apply them to a range of scenarios at landscape and regional scales as an integrated system. Working within these scenarios, AI/ML can process data to visualize the consequences and trade-offs of different CEC conditions and types of interventions at the local scale. Extending this to permafrost and defense, AI/ML creates knowledge of where and when a strategic advantage may be gained and by whom as CEC affects different types of infrastructure and ecological processes. For example, permafrost underlies the majority of Russia’s Arctic coastline and infrastructure in the region. Using AI/ML to model these effects accelerates the ability to accurately gauge, for example, which military bases will be at risk and what the consequences are to the United States and its partners and allies, which can lead to better precision in defense planning and diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI/ML can be used in this context only because extensive funding over the past 30 years has yielded rule sets for permafrost physics, soil biology, and behavior of built environments that are highly precise. This means AI/ML worlds can be used to scale down to individual structures, which can rapidly improve the way infrastructure, logistics, and operations are designed. However, knowledge of how humans will react to such changes is lacking, such as how communities could be held at risk by and respond to the loss of freshwater resources. AI/ML offers a readily available laboratory to run scenarios and understand trade-offs far more quickly, cost effectively, and safely than could ever be accomplished in the past. Its value is increased when it is used as a tool that enhances engagements with diverse human communities. Since it allows multiple variables to run simultaneously, and since these series can be adjusted and amended in real time by human stakeholders and rights-holders, it also helps eliminate much of the uncertainty that policymakers and decisionmakers dislike. For example, it can be used to better identify key water sources and the systems that need to be in place to either protect them or mitigate their loss, in order to ensure their resilience for future use. In short, knowing the likely effects of permafrost on key resources allows affected communities to articulate consequences, trade-offs, and their approaches to dealing with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that AI/ML does not provide answers or solutions, it merely enables the humans tackling these challenges to ask better questions, refine understandings, and then ask the harder questions together. This cycle has traditionally taken months or years but can be done within hours via AI/ML-assisted research. Indeed, the key to addressing the many unknowns of a rapidly changing Arctic and the roadmap to resilience in defense and security is asking the right questions. Using AI/ML offers the freedom to think and do things differently by envisioning scenarios of plausible futures where a diverse range of adaptation interventions can be examined — in collaboration with the people, especially local actors, who will have to carry them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latter point underlines yet another benefit of leveraging AI/ML: this process of refining questions simultaneously enhances partnerships. In fact, one of the most critical factors in using AI/ML effectively is close collaboration with rights-holders and stakeholders — ideally at the same time — whether they be local communities or military planners. Models that are not aligned with the perceptions and knowledge that exist at local scales induce higher uncertainties in outcomes. In other words, using AI/ML to understand the consequences of changes in permafrost and develop the interventions to build resilience relies as much on human behaviors as it does on engineering. AI/ML is a key tool to bring the end users, operators, and stakeholders directly into the data-driven scenarios where human perceptions, decisionmaking, and reactions can be incorporated in real time, something that cannot be achieved outside of AI/ML-built worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the overwhelming evidence that human behaviors and social dynamics are powerful determinants of resilience outcomes, disciplinary approaches in engineering, human factors (i.e., human-machine teaming), and ecology heavily dominate Arctic permafrost research. Alone, these will not deliver the level of adaptation needed to address CEC in the Arctic because adaptation is itself a human endeavor, which requires the integration of the social sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adaptation can be accomplished by leveraging the analytic power of AI/ML to integrate the authoritative data available in hand, in order to identify critical gaps in knowledge, training, and preparedness and gain a more precise understanding of resilience. Approaching permafrost in the Arctic as an engineering problem will not lead to resilience if social dynamics are not central to analyses. AI/ML has often been criticized as something that removes humans from the loop, but it is only through engagement with partners — those who must deal with the consequences of changing permafrost, especially the loss of freshwater systems — that it is possible to develop accurate scenarios where decisions can be made and the effects of those decisions can be seen more quickly. Approaching permafrost thaw in the Arctic through AI/ML-assisted scenarios built and amended by stakeholders will result in more effective policies and the acquisition of technologies that are tailored to specific adaptations. For example, instead of trying to move water over long distances, something that requires an enormous amount of fuel, water storage systems can be engineered specific to the locale in which permafrost is changing. Innovation is often met with resistance even at the highest levels, but a growing number of practitioners — including colleagues across academia, Arctic communities, the U.S. government, and partners from the Five Eyes and NATO alliances — recognize the need to shift the approach to science and encourage the use of AI-related tools such as agent-based modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI/ML is clearly a useful tool for permafrost research in the Arctic, and other nations are beating the United States to it. Leveraging it may even lead to ideas for novel applications relevant for questions of Arctic geopolitics, such as Russia’s militarization of the region. Without AI/ML, the United States may not gain insights at the speed of need, and research will remain slow and expensive, yielding models that are less useful to the U.S. defense enterprise and the stakeholders and partners in the Arctic on whom the United States relies. Leveraging AI/ML allows the mess of reality, in all its glorious diversity, to be incorporated into a structured set of analyses and scenarios that are only possible with advanced computational tools. It is the means by which the inputs from diverse stakeholders, whether the defense enterprise or an Indigenous corporation, can be fully included in establishing and maintaining adaptation actions that collectively ensure resilience in a rapidly changing Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

To ensure that those drawing lessons from the conflict do so from a solid foundation, this report seeks to outline key lessons, based on the operational data accumulated by the Ukrainian General Staff, from the fighting between February and July 2022. As the underlying source material for much of this report cannot yet be made public, this should be understood as testimony rather than as an academic study. Given the requirements for operational security, it is necessarily incomplete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia planned to invade Ukraine over a 10-day period and thereafter occupy the country to enable annexation by August 2022. The Russian plan presupposed that speed, and the use of deception to keep Ukrainian forces away from Kyiv, could enable the rapid seizure of the capital. The Russian deception plan largely succeeded, and the Russians achieved a 12:1 force ratio advantage north of Kyiv. The very operational security that enabled the successful deception, however, also led Russian forces to be unprepared at the tactical level to execute the plan effectively. The Russian plan’s greatest deficiency was the lack of reversionary courses of action. As a result, when speed failed to produce the desired results, Russian forces found their positions steadily degraded as Ukraine mobilised. Despite these setbacks, Russia refocused on Donbas and, since Ukraine had largely expended its ammunition supply, proved successful in subsequent operations, slowed by the determination – rather than the capabilities – of Ukrainian troops. From April, the West became Ukraine’s strategic depth, and the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) only robbed Russia of the initiative once long-range fires brought Russian logistics under threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tactical competence of the Russian military proved significantly inferior compared with the expectations of many observers based within and outside Ukraine and Russia. Nevertheless, Russian weapons systems proved largely effective, and those units with a higher level of experience demonstrated that the AFRF have considerable military potential, even if deficiencies in training and the context of how they were employed meant that the Russian military failed to meet that potential. Factoring in the idiosyncrasies of the Russian campaign, there are five key areas that should be monitored to judge whether the Russian military is making progress in resolving its structural and cultural deficiencies. These areas should be used to inform assessments of Russian combat power in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFRF currently operate with a hierarchy of jointery in which the priorities of the land component are paramount, and the military as a whole is subordinate to the special services. This creates sub-optimal employment of other branches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFRF force-generation model is flawed. It proposes the creation of amalgamated combined arms formations in wartime but lacks the strength of junior leadership to knit these units together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a culture of reinforcing failure unless orders are changed at higher levels. This appears less evident in the Russian Aerospace Forces than in the Ground Forces and Navy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFRF are culturally vulnerable to deception because they lack the ability to rapidly fuse information, are culturally averse to providing those who are executing orders with the context to exercise judgement, and incentivise a dishonest reporting culture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFRF’s capabilities and formations are prone to fratricide. Electronic warfare (EW) systems and other capabilities rarely deconflict, while processes for identifying friend from foe and establishing control measures are inadequate. The result is that capabilities that should magnify one another’s effects must be employed sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond assessments of the Russian armed forces, there are significant lessons to be drawn from the conflict for the British and other NATO militaries. The foremost of these are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In due course, it will be possible to extend this study to cover the later phase of the war when Ukraine moved on to offensive operations. As the UAF expend significant ammunition, however, and now depend on their international partners for equipment, it is important that those partners draw the appropriate lessons from the war so far, not least so that they can prepare themselves to deter future threats and to best support Ukraine. Ukraine’s victory is possible, but it requires significant heavy fighting. With appropriate support, Ukraine can prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no sanctuary in modern warfare. The enemy can strike throughout operational depth. Survivability depends on dispersing ammunitions stocks, command and control, maintenance areas and aircraft. Ukraine successfully evaded Russia’s initial wave of strikes by dispersing its arsenals, aircraft and air defences. Conversely, the Russians succeeded in engaging 75% of static defence sites in the first 48 hours of the war. Nor is setting up a headquarters in a civilian building sufficient to make it survivable. The British Army must consider the vulnerability of higher-echelon enablement. The RAF must consider how many deployable spares kits it has to enable dispersion of its fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warfighting demands large initial stockpiles and significant slack capacity. Despite the prominence of anti-tank guided weapons in the public narrative, Ukraine blunted Russia’s attempt to seize Kyiv using massed fires from two artillery brigades. The difference in numbers between Russian and Ukrainian artillery was not as significant at the beginning of the conflict, with just over a 2:1 advantage: 2,433 barrel artillery systems against 1,176; and 3,547 multiple-launch rocket systems against 1,680. Ukraine maintained artillery parity for the first month and a half and then began to run low on munitions so that, by June, the AFRF had a 10:1 advantage in volume of fire. Evidently, no country in NATO, other than the US, has sufficient initial weapons stocks for warfighting or the industrial capacity to sustain largescale operations. This must be rectified if deterrence is to be credible and is equally a problem for the RAF and Royal Navy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) and counter-UAS (CUAS) are essential across all branches and at all echelons. Although critical to competitiveness by providing situational awareness, 90% of UAS employed are lost. For the most part, UAS must be cheap and attritable. For land forces, they must be organic to units for the purposes of both situational awareness and target acquisition. The primary means of CUAS is EW. Another critical tactical requirement is to be alerted to the presence of UAS. For the Royal Navy, CUAS is critical for protecting vessels operating beyond the protection of a task force. For the RAF, the provision of look-down sensing to locate UAS to contribute to air defence is critical. This allows defensive resources to be prioritised on the right axes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The force must fight for the right to precision. Precision is not only vastly more efficient in the effects it delivers but also allows the force to reduce its logistics tail and thereby makes it more survivable. Precision weapons, however, are scarce and can be defeated by EW. To enable kill chains to function at the speed of relevance, EW for attack, protection and direction finding is a critical element of modern combined arms operations. Sequencing fires to disrupt EW and create windows of opportunity for precision effects is critical and creates training requirements. In modern warfare, the electromagnetic spectrum is unlikely to be denied, but it is continually disrupted, and forces must endeavour to gain advantage within it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For land forces, the pervasive ISTAR on the modern battlefield and the layering of multiple sensors at the tactical level make concealment exceedingly difficult to sustain. Survivability is often afforded by being sufficiently dispersed to become an uneconomical target, by moving quickly enough to disrupt the enemy’s kill chain and thereby evade engagement, or by entering hardened structures. Shell scrapes and hasty defences can increase immediate survivability but also risk the force becoming fixed by fire while precision fires and specialist munitions do not leave these positions survivable. Forces instead should prioritise concentrating effects while only concentrating mass under favourable conditions – with an ability to offer mutual support beyond line of sight – and should give precedence to mobility as a critical component of their survivability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has seen the return of conventional warfighting to Europe. This has provided an unparalleled opportunity to assess Russia’s military capabilities and the impacts of a range of modern weapons on the battlefield. Ensuring that the correct lessons are drawn from the conflict is vital in two key respects: for Ukraine, if it is to receive appropriate military support from its international partners; and for NATO members, if they are to ensure they are militarily capable of deterring aggression in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debates about the relative merits of armour, anti-armour weapons, electronic warfare (EW) and airpower have been fierce among external observers of the conflict. Most of these debates, however, have lacked any grounding in data. Much of the discourse surrounding the war has drawn on fragmentary online videos that show specific activities detached from a wider tactical or operational context. A great many definitive statements have been made about Russian capabilities based on the propaganda material produced by both sides. There are partial public datasets regarding Russian losses, but there is almost no detailed information on Ukrainian dispositions, actions, decision-making or setbacks. There is, therefore, a high risk that false lessons will be drawn from the war. Given that Ukraine now depends on its international partners for its strategic depth in training and materiel, a reasonable understanding of what transpired and the actual demands of modern combat in the Ukrainian theatre is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to August 2022, when Ukraine was on the defensive against a large-scale and determined Russian offensive, operational security demanded that the Ukrainian government minimise the available information on its forces, dispositions and tactics. This is still the case with the preparation and conduct of offensive operations by the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF), their preparations to counter newly mobilised Russian units and the effects of Russia’s renewed strike campaign against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. How Ukraine denied Russia its initial theory of victory and how the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) reprioritised to offensive operations in Donbas are now sufficiently historical to allow for a more open discussion of events. This report is an account of the pre-war plans of both Russia and Ukraine, the course of the initial phases of the war between February and July 2022, an overview of what has been learned about the AFRF, and an assessment of the implications for NATO and specifically the UK military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is methodologically problematic. It draws on the operational data accumulated by the General Staff of the UAF during the conflict, which was made available to the authors. A significant proportion of this data cannot be made public but was used to inform the conclusions of this report. A good example is Ukrainian losses, which are factored into the conclusions reached as regards the relative effectiveness of tactics and capabilities but cannot be disclosed as they remain operationally sensitive. Other data that is cited was sometimes obtained through methods and sources of collection that are sensitive. The authors have considered the data in the context of its method of collection and the corresponding confidence in its accuracy. However, these judgements cannot be discussed in the report because the nature of the underlying sources for this data remains classified. For this reason, this report should not be considered a work of academic scholarship and it does not use citations. Rather, it should be considered as testimony based on personal observations of the authors. This includes the direct participation in strategic and operational decision-making during the war by two of the authors: Lieutenant General Mykhaylo Zabrodskyi and Oleksandr V Danylyuk. It also includes extensive interactions and consultations with Ukrainian military and intelligence personnel at all levels and the observation of tactical activities by Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds, who worked in Ukraine in January, February, April, June, August and October 2022. Although this report is methodologically imperfect, the speed at which Ukraine’s partners must make decisions on procurement, training and capability development to ensure their own preparedness means that it was felt to be more useful to publish an imperfect study than wait for the evidence to be publishable long after its relevance to decision-makers had passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to clarify what is and is not considered in this report. The work is intended to properly frame the international understanding of the conventional military aspects of the conflict. It therefore focuses on areas that deserve attention. It is too short to be a comprehensive study of what transpired throughout the conflict. The conclusions are limited to the consideration of conventional operations and do not seek to assess the extensive unconventional campaign waged by Russia against Ukraine. That said, unconventional operations are necessarily described insofar as they provide context for conventional force employment, but conclusions on the lessons to be learned regarding unconventional operations from the war are to be the subject of a separate and adjacent study. It is also important to reiterate that this report does not cover events after July 2022 when the UAF began undertaking offensive operations; these activities have produced additional lessons that are important for a broader appreciation of the challenges on the modern battlefield, even though they are regrettably inappropriate to publicly disclose at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has five chapters. Chapter I outlines Russia’s invasion plan as set out in captured copies of the orders issued to a range of Russian units. Given the criticality of unconventional operations in this plan, and the impact of these activities on the posture and tasks assigned to Russia’s conventional forces, the chapter necessarily describes these in some detail. Since there was exhaustive discussion of the size and capabilities of Russia’s conventional forces around Ukraine prior to the conflict, these details are only described in terms of the alignment of Russian forces to operational groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter II sets out Ukraine’s capabilities, assumptions and starting positions at the beginning of the war. One of the major problems with public analysis of the conflict has been the lack of awareness of the capabilities of the UAF. For example, the public obsession with anti-tank guided weapons (ATGWs) largely ignored the large number of main battle tanks fielded by the UAF at the beginning of the conflict. This chapter, therefore, seeks to partly explain what Ukraine could field at the start of the war, as well as how Ukraine planned to defend itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter III covers the course of the first three phases of the invasion, from 24 February to the beginning of July 2022. It is largely narrative but focuses on the command decisions and key factors that shaped the success or failure of specific tasks undertaken by both Russian and Ukrainian forces. The chapter tries to also explain the concepts of operation employed by the AFRF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter IV details observations regarding the performance of the AFRF. Rather than describing Russia’s strengths and shortcomings in context, this chapter endeavours to identify wider cultural and structural challenges for its military that can be tracked to judge whether Russian military performance is improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter V provides a summary of relevant lessons for the British military seeking to refine its capabilities, training and organisation to be prepared for high-intensity warfare in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report concludes with recommendations for policymakers. First, consumption rates of munitions, materiel and systems during high-intensity warfighting will be high, and stockpiles are critical to conventional defence being credible; second, national policies, permissions and industrial processes must be adaptable enough to allow change at the speed of relevance; and third, getting the correct mix of and synergies between new and legacy systems is essential to effective modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-russias-planning-and-preparations&quot;&gt;I. Russia’s Planning and Preparations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s strategic objective in its invasion of Ukraine was the subjugation of the Ukrainian state. This plan was formulated first and foremost by Russia’s special services and a core group within the presidential administration, supported by senior officials in the Ministry of Defence. As such, it is necessary to briefly outline the wider context from which the orders to Russia’s conventional forces were derived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s military build-up against Ukraine began in March 2021 when large numbers of conventional troops were added to existing forces along Ukraine’s borders. This build-up performed three functions. First, it put pressure on Western governments to re-engage in the Minsk II negotiations to encourage Kyiv to make concessions and thereby avert a conflict. Second, it pre-positioned military equipment around Ukraine that would allow for a more rapid build-up of forces when the time came for the invasion. Third, it provided an opportunity for Moscow to assess the reaction of Ukraine’s international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s international partners dismissed the threat in spring 2021 because they did not observe the necessary enablers deployed with the Russian formations nor the necessary political shaping of the information environment in Russia to support an invasion. They were correct on both counts – the build-up turned out to be a mobilisation exercise. However, the lesson for the Kremlin was that the enablers could be brought to the formations faster than Ukraine’s partners could bring military capabilities: if these were the indicators that would cause international partners to react, they would do so too late. The Kremlin’s confidence that it could invade Ukraine without significant international interference was an important reason for undertaking the full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2021, the 9th Section of the 5th Service of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) was enlarged into a directorate and tasked with planning for the occupation of Ukraine. As part of this preparation, the FSB drew on extensive surveys carried out in Ukraine. These surveys painted a picture of a largely politically apathetic Ukrainian society that distrusted its leaders, was primarily concerned about the economy and thought an escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine was unlikely. Moreover, Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally articulated in an essay in July 2021 his belief that the people of Ukraine viewed Russians favourably and believed they were part of a shared civilisation, cruelly divided by historical political mistakes. The barrier, in his view, to correcting these mistakes was the government in Kyiv, which he accused of being a puppet to external powers hostile to Russia. The Russian military leadership was also confident that it would defeat the UAF after more than a decade of modernisation. Assurances from General Valery Gerasimov on Russia’s military capabilities played a key role in shaping the confidence of Russia’s special services in their plan. As Gerasimov told international interlocutors on the outbreak of the war, ‘I command the second most powerful Army in the world’. Separately Gerasimov told British counterparts that Russia had achieved conventional military parity with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conception of the Russian invasion therefore was developed around several key assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speed was critical to success to render the response of the international community irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The removal of Ukraine’s leaders would remove the barrier for pro-Russian Ukrainians to vocalise support for the occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Controlling heating, electricity and finance would be an effective means of controlling the apathetic majority of the Ukrainian population.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Russian military could defeat the Ukrainian military on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these assumptions, the FSB, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Gerasimov and elements within the presidential administration developed their plan to achieve Putin’s strategic goal. The key military-strategic tasks for the Russian military and security forces were to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Degrade Ukraine’s ability to defend itself by destroying its air, maritime and air-defence forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defeat Ukrainian Ground Forces by fixing them in Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diffuse Ukraine’s will and capacity to resist by eliminating Ukraine’s political and military leadership and occupying critical centres of political and economic power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deceive the Ukrainian government as to the time, location, scope and scale of Russia’s invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a tension in this plan between the aim of diffusing Ukraine’s political unity and deceiving Ukraine as to the intent. The former would have required a sustained shaping phase preceding the invasion. The latter demanded speed. It appears that Russian planners succumbed to optimism bias as to the dislocating effect that speed itself could achieve in diffusing Ukraine’s will to resist and therefore opted to undertake a shock and awe campaign with little preliminary shaping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia planned to commence the invasion with a massive missile and airstrike campaign against Ukraine’s air defences, command and control (C2) infrastructure, airfields and ammunition storage depots. This campaign would not target critical infrastructure such as power stations and railways, because these were vital to Russia’s plans for occupying the country. The elimination of Ukraine’s political leadership would primarily be a task for Russia’s special services. Another line of effort, allocated to Russia’s special forces and air-assault troops, was to capture Ukraine’s power stations, airfields, water supplies, central bank and parliament. The intelligence community of Ukraine believes that Russia also planned to use Belarusian airborne units to capture the Rivne and Khmelnytsky nuclear power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable these operations, Russia’s Ground Forces were to simultaneously advance under several groups of forces to clear and occupy administrative centres on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro River, along with Kyiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Odesa. Russian groups of forces were built around the military district command posts, with the name of the group of forces corresponding to the military district commanding the direction. This can cause some confusion as the military district names correspond with their geographical position in Russia, but do not correspond with their relative position in Ukraine. The northern axis was the main effort, focused on the encirclement and capture of Kyiv. For this purpose, the Russians formed two groups of forces commanded from the Eastern Military District Command Post. One group was formed in the Gomel region of Belarus and used the tactical sign ‘V’ with orders to attack Kyiv along the right (western) bank of the Dnipro River. The second group was formed in the Bryansk region of Russia and used the tactical sign ‘O’ with orders to surround Kyiv from the left (eastern) bank. The Southern Military District Command Post commanded units with the tactical symbol ‘Z in a square’, ordered to attack from occupied Crimea to establish control over the North Crimean Water Canal, Energodar and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, surround Mariupol, take control of the bridges over the Dnipro and advance along the right bank to Voznesensk with the aim of seizing the South Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant. The Western Military District Command Post commanded groups of forces projected from Kursk, Belgorod and Voronezh using the tactical symbol ‘Z’ and tasked with encircling the Ukrainian troops in Donbas along the Lozova–Gulyapole line or the Barvinkovo–Velika Novosilka line. Such an encirclement, combined with fixing operations along the line of control using conscripts from occupied Luhansk and Donetsk, was intended to cut off about 50% of the UAF (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4b41HF2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Original Russian Axes of Advance.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground forces were assigned sectors and tasks down to the level of the battalion tactical group. For mechanised forces, the intent was often to rapidly occupy and thereafter isolate and screen key objectives. On the axis from Gomel to Kyiv, for example, the force was divided into a screening force that was to establish positions facing west to cut off Kyiv from western Ukraine, and units responsible for pushing into the city. Very little consideration appears to have been given to Ukrainian reserves or the Territorial Defence Forces (TDF). The assertion in Russian planning that Ukraine could generate only 40,000 additional troops appears to be premised on the anticipated speed of the operation rather than an appreciation of Ukraine’s capacity for mobilisation. This emphasis on speed led to units being ordered to advance in administrative column by road and to attempt to bypass any initial resistance. The assumption was that by D+10, Russian units would transition to stabilisation operations. The synchronisation matrix of the 1st Guards Tank Army (Western Military District), for example, captured near Kyiv in March 2022, stated that by D+10 the force would ‘proceed to the blocking and destruction of individual scattered units of the Armed Forces and the remnants of nationalist resistance units’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final grouping of Russian forces comprised the amphibious component and dispositions of the Black Sea Fleet. Two amphibious task groups were created with the intention of conducting landings ahead of advancing Russian ground forces on the Kherson–Mykolaiv–Odesa axis. These were to go in after the initial invasion, preceding the Ground Forces to seize key intersections and chokepoints to enable the rapid onwards movement of troops along the coast after Mykolaiv. In addition to this task, the Black Sea Fleet was to support the massive strike campaign by launching Kalibr cruise missiles throughout the depth of Ukraine, and isolate the theatre by blockading the Ukrainian coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After D+10, the role of Russia’s conventional forces was to transition to a supporting function to Russia’s special services, responsible for establishing occupation administrations on the territories. Since these activities were critical to the Russian theory of victory in the operation, it is important to outline these plans to appropriately contextualise the role of the conventional force. The assumption appears to have been that Ukrainian government officials would either flee or be captured as a result of the speed of the invasion. It was also anticipated that shock would prevent the immediate mobilisation of the population, and that protests and other civil resistance could be managed through the targeted disintegration of Ukrainian civil society. To manage these protests Russian forces would be supported by Rosgvardia (Russian National Guard) and riot control units. Meanwhile the FSB was tasked with capturing local officials. The Russian counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories had compiled lists that divided Ukrainians into four categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those to be physically liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those in need of suppression and intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those considered neutral who could be induced to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those prepared to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those in the top category, the FSB had conducted wargames with detachments of the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) to conduct kill-or-capture missions. In many cases, the purpose of capture was to put individuals involved in the 2014 Revolution of Dignity (often referred to as the Maidan Revolution) on trial to be executed. Although initial lists of persons in the second category existed, the approach was to be more methodical, with the registration of the population through door-to-door sweeps and the use of filtration camps to establish counterintelligence files on large portions of the population in the occupied territories. Filtration would be used to intimidate people, to determine whether they needed to be displaced into Russia, and to lay the groundwork for records to monitor and disrupt resistance networks. Over time, Russia would bring teachers and other officials from Russia itself to engage in the re-education of Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intended method of political control had both a regional and national component. The regional component comprised the coerced cooperation of regional governors and local authorities. The national component involved the murder of Ukraine’s executive branch and the capture of parliament. The pro-Russian faction within the parliament would be encouraged to form a Movement for Peace, which other parliamentarians would be encouraged and coerced to support. This Movement for Peace would ban resistance in the name of preserving peace. Regions that resisted could thereafter be cut off from electricity, water and finance from the central bank, following motions through this parliamentary body. Ukraine’s nuclear power plants served three purposes therefore in the invasion plan: to function as reliable shelters for Russia’s troops and military personnel, equipment, command posts and ammunition depots; to gain control over Ukraine’s energy system, because nuclear power plants are responsible for generating more than 60% of Ukraine’s electricity; and to provide the option to obtain leverage for blackmailing European countries with the risk of radiation pollution as a result of possible accidents at nuclear power plants if they attempted to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the seizure of nuclear power plants and scientific facilities engaged in nuclear energy research in Kharkiv and Kyiv was an important element of Russia’s planned war propaganda. While justifying military aggression against Ukraine, Russian propaganda actively spread disinformation among its own population about the alleged threat Ukraine posed to Russia. Along with the narrative about the alleged presence of ‘American Pentagon biolaboratories’ in Ukraine, which were developing biological weapons, Russian propagandists and officials actively spread information about the alleged intention of Ukraine to restore nuclear weapons, which it gave up in 1994 in exchange for security assurances from Russia, the US and the UK as part of the Budapest Memorandum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goals of the Russian invasion were not only ‘denazification’, the destruction of national sovereignty and the banning of Ukrainian identity and ‘demilitarisation’, the destruction and banning of the UAF and the export to Russia of enterprises of the defence industrial complex of Ukraine, but also ‘denuclearisation’, the capture of nuclear power plants and their transfer to the direct management of Rosatom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces massed on the Ukrainian border in autumn 2021 received orders to the effect that they would be away from their barracks for nine months. These orders, issued approximately three to four months before the invasion, demonstrate that the Russian government anticipated having Ukraine under complete control by summer 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian plans for the invasion of Ukraine were detailed and offered solutions to most of the practical problems that Russia would face in occupying Ukraine. If competently executed, these plans could have succeeded. As shall be seen later in this report, they came much closer to doing so than is widely appreciated. Although the assumption that there would be minimal resistance was incorrect, the occupation of southern Ukraine demonstrates that speed did offer a realistic path to asserting control over territory, even without popular support. Furthermore, despite the resistance of the Ukrainian armed forces, Russia had the combat power at the beginning of the war to overcome many Ukrainian formations. Beyond the shortcomings in the execution of the plan and the poor performance of Russian combat units, there are fundamental aspects of the plan that must be understood to appreciate the peculiarities of Russia’s operations in Ukraine in the first phase of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These plans were drawn up by a very small group of officials and the intent was directed by Putin. Many officials executing elements of the preparation were unaware of the wider intent. Russian military personnel – even up to deputy heads of branches within the Russian General Staff – were unaware of the intention to invade and occupy Ukraine until days before the invasion, and tactical military units did not receive orders until hours before they entered Ukraine. While this helped to achieve operational surprise – which was no doubt the intent – the tiny pool of personnel involved contributed to a range of false assumptions that appear never to have been challenged. That the Russians overstretched in terms of the number of axes embarked upon, the small size of the force employed for many tasks, and the failure to develop appropriate contingencies is indicative of many contributing technical judgements to the planning not having been fully briefed about the overall context. No independent red teaming appears to have taken place. Instead, the plan itself – while theoretically plausible – compounded optimism bias in each of its stages and, most tellingly, offered no reversionary courses of action, indicated no decision points to determine whether conventional forces should adjust their posture nor envisaged any outcome other than its own success. Neither did the plan account for the needs of those tasked with implementing it, nor afford any agency to Ukraine. The FSB’s inaccurate assessment of the reaction of Ukrainian society is much less consequential in how the plan actually unfolded than the fact that there is no evidence in the Russian planning that anyone had asked what would occur if any of its key assumptions were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-ukraines-planning-and-preparations&quot;&gt;II. Ukraine’s Planning and Preparations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To properly understand what transpired in the opening phases of the conflict, the preparations made by the UAF since 2014 need to be appreciated. Many claims about the impact of Western military-technical assistance – for example – are problematic because they do not contextualise these systems alongside the existing capabilities of the UAF. Appreciating the scale of the conventional fight is important if the right lessons are to be drawn from the fighting. Once the structure and capabilities of the UAF are understood, the posture and dispositions of the force in February 2022 can be discussed in context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manoeuvre-brigades-special-forces-and-territorial-defence&quot;&gt;Manoeuvre Brigades, Special Forces and Territorial Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure and condition of Ukraine’s infantry and manoeuvre forces is worth considering, less in terms of their technical capabilities than in terms of their mindset, cohesion and C2. To begin, the Ukrainian Ground Forces had been in constant combat since 2014. Such combat may have been low intensity, but with more than 90 Ukrainian soldiers killed by Russian forces in 2021, it nevertheless required soldiers to take their tasks seriously and to prepare for escalation. For officers who rotated through the Joint Forces Operations (JFO) area, they had months to walk the ground, prepare positions and build an intimate understanding of the battlefield. The conversation throughout the UAF was what they would do in the event of a Russian escalation. Putting aside operational-level planning, even down to the level of platoon, the experience of junior officers and soldiers was to observe – for months – Russian positions that posed a threat to them and their comrades. These units had made extensive plans among themselves as to how they would defeat these positions in the event of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, at the operational level, it was understood throughout the UAF that Russia may renew its assault on Ukraine. In 2014, the Russian military had tried to seize the country, only to pull back. Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service and other parts of the Russian government had urged a more deliberate aggression against Ukraine in 2015. The possibility, therefore, had been at the forefront of the minds of UAF officers. Wargames and exercises at formation level envisaged a defence against the full capabilities of the Russian military. Ukrainian units were confident that at the tactical level they would be better trained and better prepared than their adversaries. The persistent concern among commanders was the impact of artillery on their freedom to manoeuvre and, crucially, on their lines of supply. This problem was exacerbated by the shortage of personnel. With 10 brigades covering the entire line of contact in the JFO, a brigade frontage at the start of the war was around 20 km. This left a limited reserve and depended on a manoeuvre defence to counterattack against breaches in the line. Each brigade started the war with around 10 days of ammunition, but there was limited confidence – given the threat from artillery – that more would reach the lines if the Russians committed all their capabilities to this axis. Nevertheless, having observed the treatment of Ukrainians in the occupied territories after 2014, Ukrainian forces were also highly motivated in preventing more of the country falling into Russian hands and morale among the troops was therefore high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lkmpCSq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retaining a sufficient force was a challenge from 2014. The main problem was pay. Although pay had been increased, it did not keep pace with inflation, nor was it competitive with pay in the private sector. Combined with the use of short-term contracts, this contributed to a high turnover of personnel. Prior to 24 February 2022, this created serious problems for the UAF. It not only meant that many units had a shortage of specialists such as communicators, but also that the Ministry of Defence was having to expend disproportionate resources to train new specialists who would rarely be retained in the force. There was a benefit to this situation, however. Ukrainian reservists and wider society contained a very large number of people who had military experience and were trained to perform specialist tasks. One of the major errors in Russian planning for the invasion was its assessment of the number of reservists Ukraine could mobilise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also several brigades and units where retention was less problematic, and these constituted highly experienced formations. Among these units were the seven brigades of the Air Assault Forces, and the Special Operations Forces consisting of two regiments and two special operations centres. In addition, there were the Special Units of Ukraine’s Special Services, including the 10th Special Unit of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Special Unit Alpha within the Security Service of Ukraine, the Special Forces of the National Guard, State Border Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service, responsible for operations deep behind enemy lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of the TDF was an attempt to capitalise on the depth of Ukraine’s reserves and the will of the population to create mass and therefore resilience. Established as a unified entity in January 2022, the TDF were conceptually promising, and over time have proven a valuable means of creating new combat units that can be trained to support the armed forces. However, even pre-existing Territorial Defence units were created far too close to the invasion to be well established and effective at the beginning of the war. It is important to understand that for the Ukrainian government, Russia’s campaign against the country was continued for almost a decade and the cost of maintaining large territorial defence structures versus their immediate military utility made investment in such a structure a challenge for the UAF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the TDF were only established in 2022, they lacked heavy weapons, or the C2 mechanisms to use them. They also had a limited command structure. While the value of the TDF has steadily increased – progressing from rear-area security to ground holding to contributing manoeuvre brigades to offensive operations – at the beginning of the conflict the lack of integrated C2 for these units made them an impediment in many cases. This is not the fault of the TDF personnel who mobilised to defend Ukraine, but simply reflects that trying to mobilise and coordinate such a large body of personnel with just over a month to establish chains of command and to distribute the necessary communications and training imposed a limit on how effectively they could be integrated into the armed forces. As of 24 February, therefore, the UAF had a limited body of experienced and professional manoeuvre brigades and had to make difficult decisions as to where to prioritise their deployment. They also had a large pool of tactically competent reserves, and a larger pool of willing civilian volunteers, but limited stocks of equipment to provision them. The critical question therefore was whether the professional body of the UAF could hold for long enough for a wider mobilisation to bolster Ukraine’s defences in the event of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;artillery&quot;&gt;Artillery&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its manoeuvre forces, Ukraine had systematically attempted to strengthen the combat support for its forces after 2014, recognising the significant fires capabilities of the AFRF. In the eight years of fighting before 2022, artillery had accounted for around 90% of casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, President Viktor Yanukovych’s pro-Russian government carried out a systematic reduction of missile and artillery troops. Thus, by the time of the Russian invasion of Crimea, the Ukrainian Ground Forces fielded one missile brigade armed with 9K79-1 ‘Tochka-U’ tactical missile complexes, two artillery brigades equipped with 152-mm self-propelled and towed howitzers ‘MSTA-S’ and ‘MSTA-B’, 152-mm self-propelled and towed guns ‘Hyacinth-S’ and ‘Hyacinth-B’, and 203-mm self-propelled guns ‘Pion’. They also fielded three artillery regiments, armed with 220-mm ‘Uragan’ and 300-mm ‘Smerch’ multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS). In addition, artillery units of mechanised and tank brigades used 152-mm and 122-mm artillery installations ‘Akatsiya’ and ‘Gvozdika’, as well as 122-mm MLRS ‘Grad’. The units of the Airborne Assault Troops had neither their own artillery nor tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since March 2014, Ukraine has focused on recovering its artillery capabilities. As a result, five new artillery brigades and a separate artillery regiment of the Ground Forces were created, as well as one artillery brigade and a separate artillery regiment of the Navy. The 19th Separate Missile Brigade regenerated two additional battalions with tactical missile complex ‘Tochka-U’. All new combined arms brigades in the Ground Forces, as well as all brigades of the marines, received their own brigade artillery groups. By 2019, the number of artillery battalions had doubled. As of February 2022, the Missile Forces and Artillery (RViA) of the UAF had 10 brigades and one regiment as part of the Ground Forces, as well as one brigade and one regiment as part of the Navy. The UAF had 1,176 barrel artillery systems, of which 742 were 152-mm calibre systems, 421 were 122-mm howitzers, and 13 units were 203-mm systems. The RViA also fielded 1,680 MLRS of all calibres, as well as about 40 tactical missile systems ‘Tochka-U’. In terms of the number of artillery systems, Ukraine fielded the largest artillery force in Europe after Russia. The difference in numbers between Russian and Ukrainian artillery was not so significant at the beginning of the conflict: 2,433 barrel artillery systems against 1,176, and 3,547 MLRS against 1,680.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAF had ammunition to support these systems in high-intensity warfighting for just over six weeks. Ammunition had been depleted by regular explosions at Ukrainian arsenals as a result of Russian sabotage. From 2014 to 2018, there were six such explosions, which destroyed more than 210,000 tonnes of ammunition, a large part of which were 152-mm shells and rockets for MLRS. For comparison, during the five years of the war in Donbas, the UAF spent about 70,000 tons of ammunition in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of Ukrainian artillery was not limited to increasing the number of artillery systems and units. A lot of effort was also put into qualitative improvement. Since 2015, all battalions began to receive UAVs ‘Furia’, ‘Leleka’, PD-1 and others, which significantly increased their ISR capabilities. US radars AN/TPQ-36, designed to determine the coordinates of enemy artillery, were transferred to Ukraine as part of US military-technical assistance and strengthened the capabilities for conducting counter-battery fire. The use of the ‘Kropyva’ combat control system – Ukrainian intelligent mapping software – saw an 80% reduction in the deployment time for artillery units. Simultaneously, the amount of time to destroy an unplanned target was reduced by two-thirds, and the time to open counter-battery fire by 90%. Special attention was paid to personnel training. Every year, the armed forces conducted more than 35 field brigade tactical exercises and more than 200 field battalion tactical exercises for artillery. Thus, Ukrainian defence plans aimed at using manoeuvre forces to fix and canalise attackers to enable their destruction by concentrated artillery fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;armour&quot;&gt;Armour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role and significance of armour in the conflict must be underpinned by an understanding of the tactical evolution of its employment over the past eight years and the scale at which armour is fielded by the UAF. Counting the two regular and four reserve tank brigades, tank units of mechanised and mountain brigades, as well as brigades of marines and air-assault troops, the UAF fielded about 30 tank battalions at the start of the conflict. A significant part of these tank units was formed between 2014 and 2018, for which 500 tanks were delivered to the UAF. The total number of Ukrainian main battle tanks at the time of the invasion was about 900. For comparison, the Russian armed forces had 2,800 combat-ready tanks in their invasion force, and Russian proxies in Donbas fielded about 400.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional tank doctrine would see its employment in the direct fire zone. However, during the years of the war in Donbas, the tankers of the UAF changed traditional approaches and developed techniques for indirect fire. For this task, high-explosive fragmentation projectiles are usually used. This requires the use of special guidance devices – an azimuth pointer and a side level. The use of modern technologies, in the form of graphic and calculation complexes, developed in Ukraine with the function of automated transmission of information to other tanks participating in the combat mission, made it possible to achieve high accuracy at distances of up to 10 km and reduced the time for calculating fire corrections to a few seconds. This technique blurs the line between tanks and artillery. The value of this technique is that it allows tanks to concentrate fire over a wide area while they can manoeuvre without the protection and screening needed by artillery pieces. Ukraine therefore planned to use armour as mobile reserves supporting its formations, capable of offering blunting fire against enemy movements and to support counterattacks if conditions permitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Ukraine produces BM ‘Oplot’ and T-84U, the lack of necessary funds forced the UAF to refrain from purchasing new tanks, and they instead chose to modernise their existing fleet. It was calculated that three or even four battalions of modernised tanks could be obtained for the funds required to purchase one battalion of new tanks. The 1st Tank Brigade was armed with T-64B and T-64BM ‘Bulat’ main battle tanks, which are modernised Soviet T-64 tanks. Modernised T-64s are equipped with digital radios, new internal communication and navigation systems, sighting systems with thermal imaging cameras, modified dynamic protection and other necessary options. The T-64BM ‘Bulat’ weapon system also includes the Ukrainian-made TAKO-621 tank missile system, enabling engagement of armoured vehicles, fortifications, helicopters and other targets at a distance of up to 5,000 m using Kombat guided missiles. In addition, the UAF have modernised T-72 and modernised gas turbine T-80BVs, which, due to their higher speed and manoeuvrability, are used by airborne assault troops and marines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the UAF fielded a considerable tank fleet, this does not alter the fact that Russian tanks at the beginning of the war generally had better protection and sighting systems and were able to engage targets from a greater distance. For short-range engagements, these differences in protection and sensor performance were less relevant but offered significant technical advantages to Russia in mid-range engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;anti-tank-capabilities&quot;&gt;Anti-Tank Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heavy emphasis in international commentary on anti-tank guided weapons (ATGWs) and especially those provided through military-technical assistance, means that it is vital to appreciate the volume of these capabilities and how they were distributed across the UAF to properly contextualise their impact on the fighting. At the beginning of February 2022, the armed forces received about 150 Javelin ATGW launchers with 1,000–1,200 missiles, 2,000 NLAW, as well as a large number of rocket-propelled anti-tank grenade launchers. Since Ukraine’s partners at that time were persuaded that, in the most optimistic scenarios, hostilities would be centred on street battles in the largest cities, the anti-tank weapons transferred were intended for close combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian anti-tank capabilities were not limited to Western-provided ATGWs, however. After 2014, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine purchased at least 650 launchers for anti-tank missile systems ‘Stugna-P’ and ‘Korsar’ and about 7,000 missiles for them, 150 tower systems for armoured vehicles with dual anti-tank missiles and 900 missiles for them, and 1,600 guided missiles ‘Cobra’ and ‘Kombat’ for tank missile systems. Thus, the anti-tank capabilities of the UAF at the beginning of February 2022 amounted to around 950 ATGW launchers (Javelin, ‘Stugna-P’, ‘Corsar’, ‘Barrier’) and about 9,100 missiles. To this should be added short-ranged systems such as NLAW, Kobra/Kombat missiles, as well as more than a thousand Fagot and Metis ATGWs and several thousand missiles for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to appreciate the characteristics of some of these systems, which determined how they were employed. ‘Stugna-P’, developed and manufactured at the Ukrainian state-owned enterprise KB ‘Luch’, is a more powerful equivalent of the Russian ‘Kornet’. The range of both complexes is the same – about 5,100 m – but the armour penetration of ‘Stugna-P’ is better. In addition, among the advantages of ‘Stugna-P’ is a quasi-top attack, a thermal sight that can be used at night at a distance of up to 3,000 m, as well as the ability to remotely control the launcher with a cable several dozen metres long, which significantly increases the survivability of operators on the battlefield. This class of ATGW is highly valuable for defensive operations because it allows for armour to be engaged at the ranges within which Russian armour seeks to conduct ATGW launches against defensive positions. This prevents the enemy establishing a safe overwatch position to support infantry advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution of these ATGWs was shaped by their relative training burden. Despite its effectiveness, Stugna-P and other wire-guided systems required considerable training time for operators to use the system effectively. This restricted these systems to being used by Ukraine’s existing ground forces. After 2014, a lot of attention had been paid to the training of anti-tank crews in the armed forces, and the School of Anti-Tank Artillery was created at the 184th Training Centre of the National Academy of Ground Forces. It took 30 days to prepare crews arriving from military units to properly employ Stugna-P.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javelin, by contrast, was much easier to employ, requiring days to train crews, while personnel could be trained to use NLAW in hours. Because of the wide range of additional uses of the Javelin CLU – such as ISR – these systems were prioritised for Ukrainian special forces and other specialist troops. NLAW, by contrast, was distributed widely to ground-holding units. Although Western training on these systems was excellent, the rapid delivery of training to new units often overlooked maintenance of the weapons – especially for maintaining batteries – and, as a result, there was a widespread problem early in the conflict with Western-supplied ATGWs being unusable when distributed to units. Over time, the appropriate instructions were disseminated to address this problem. The tactical employment of ATGWs by the UAF prior to the conflict was largely aimed at fixing or blunting enemy armoured manoeuvre and for use in raiding by light forces because of the speed with which units with these systems could displace. There were too few missiles, however, for these to be the primary means of attriting enemy forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-defence-capabilities&quot;&gt;Air-Defence Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most consequential causes of the international underestimation of Ukraine’s military prospects prior to the conflict arose from a simultaneous overestimation of Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) capabilities and a corresponding lack of familiarity with Ukrainian air-defence capabilities. It is therefore important to understand how Ukrainian air defences were organised and equipped at the beginning of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Russian aggression in 2014, developing the air-defence capabilities of Ukraine has been a constant priority of its government. The radio engineering troops, tasked with warning of an air attack, reorganised after 2014 to ensure they could detect targets at 300–400 km, and direct fighters and anti-aircraft missile troops against them. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the radio engineering forces of Ukraine consisted of four brigades, whose units maintained continuous radar coverage along the state border and ensured monitoring of the airspace of Ukraine. Their coverage over the Black Sea was less extensive. These units fielded 35D6M and 80K6 radars from KP ‘NVC’ ‘Iskra’, P-18 ‘Malakhit’ from HC ‘Ukrspetstechnika’, ‘Burshtyn-1800’ from NPP ‘Aerotechnika-MLT’, and other equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modernised 3D radar station 35D6M, which is also used as a surveillance radar for the S-300 anti-aircraft missile complex, is much more powerful than the outdated Soviet 19Zh6. The 35D6M radar can detect up to 300 air targets simultaneously at 360 km, while the 19Zh6 detects only 32 targets at 150 km. In addition, the Ukrainian radar has a higher accuracy in determining the coordinates, improved trajectory processing parameters and a new cooling system that significantly increases the service life of the klystrons. 35D6M also requires significantly less time to fully deploy or collapse the station, which increases its survivability. These developments had not been fully appreciated by the VKS prior to the invasion, leading to tactical errors in the employment of radio-electronic attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appearance in the UAF of the 80K6 ‘Phoenix’ radar, as well as previous versions of this system, including the 79K6 ‘Pelikan’, allowed the remote operation of the S-300PT(PS) anti-aircraft missile systems. This radar can be deployed in 15 minutes after going static, allowing for tactical redeployment. After 2014, the armed forces also received about 50 mobile ‘Malachite’ radars, which is a Ukrainian modification of the Soviet P-18MU ‘Terek’ radar. ‘Malakhit’ can detect targets moving at a speed of up to 1,000 m/s and tracking up to 256 targets at a distance of up to 400 km. In addition, this system can detect small and inconspicuous targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the war in Donbas was mostly land based, many military-political centres and industrial and energy facilities demanded air defence, which could not be limited only to detecting threats. Five nuclear plants, six dams of the Dnipro Cascade Hydroelectric Power Plant and two dams of the Dniester Cascade, and more than 10 enterprises and facilities of the chemical industry required constant cover by the anti-aircraft missile forces of the UAF, limiting protection for its manoeuvre forces. Since 2015, Ukraine has focused on restoring and increasing its combat capabilities. As of 2016, the anti-aircraft missile forces consisted of five anti-aircraft missile brigades and seven anti-aircraft missile regiments comprising 60 air-defence divisions. A Ukrainian air-defence division holds the equipment of a Western battery along with organic C2 and sustainment capabilities, thereby performing a battlefield task closer to that of a battalion. Overall, the UAF held 35 S-300PS/PT divisions, nine S-125 divisions, three S-300B divisions and 15 divisions of the Buk-M1 air-defence system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another critical component of the air-defence capabilities of the UAF was the extensive employment of man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS) across all units. The saturation of MANPADS in Ukrainian units, bolstered by those that were received as military-technical assistance before the Russian invasion, became an important element of countering Russian dominance in the air. MANPADS were complementary to the air-defence missile complexes because the latter forced enemy aviation to engage at low altitudes, where in turn they fell into the zone of impact of MANPADS. After 2014, Ukraine paid considerable attention to extending the lifespan and modernisation of its own MANPADS. The most common MANPADS in the UAF were the modernised ‘Igla-1’, which were distributed as organic elements to its units. Some were held in the Anti-Aircraft Missile Forces as mobile groups intended to provide protection for air-defence divisions as they displaced. A major problem with this distribution was the lack of access to the common air picture among those MANPADS teams not subordinated to the anti-aircraft missile forces at the beginning of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aircraft&quot;&gt;Aircraft&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian fighter aircraft were also an important component of the national air-defence system. As of 24 February 2022, the Ukrainian Air Force had about 50 MiG-29 fighters in service with the 40th Tactical Aviation Brigade in Vasylkiv and the 114th Tactical Aviation Brigade in Ivano-Frankivsk, as well as about 32 Su-27 fighters operated by the 831st tactical aviation brigade in Myrhorod and the 39th in Ozerny. The air force also flew Su-24 and Su-25 aircraft. After 2014, significant efforts were put into repairing fighters and a large proportion of the fleet was modernised. Although this left the air force with a higher proportion of available fighters, from a technical point of view it was overmatched by the combat aircraft of the VKS in almost every regard. Russian aircraft could generally see and shoot further while their countermeasures were effective against Ukrainian air-to-air munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the technical overmatch of the VKS, the training conducted by the air force prior to 24 February played a role in ensuring its survivability. An important element of the training was working out the survivability of units through the ability to disperse aircraft from the main airfields to operational ones. Special attention was also paid to the training of maintenance crews, their ability to carry out pre-flight preparation of aircraft in field conditions, and a full set of measures necessary for the performance of maintenance and routine repair of aircraft damaged during hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Ukrainian pilots understood the technical limitations of their aircraft, and the fearsome capabilities of Russian anti-aircraft systems, they had trained extensively for low-level flight over Ukrainian territory and were highly familiar with the exploitation of terrain to evade radar detection. Finally, as with other technical specialisms in the air force, Ukraine had struggled to retain pilots prior to 24 February, but consequently had a very large reserve of trained pilots. The critical limitation for the air force was airframes and their serviceability, not trained crews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maritime-defence-capabilities&quot;&gt;Maritime Defence Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian Navy was the least well equipped of the branches of service at the beginning of the war. Nevertheless, noting the economic impact of Russia’s control of the Sea of Azov, the navy had pursued modernisation since 2014 and had made important progress in expanding its capabilities. The first phase of naval modernisation was intended to be completed by 2025 and provided for the establishment of control over the territorial waters of Ukraine, maintaining coverage out to 40 nautical miles from the coast. For this purpose, the navy had to acquire the capabilities necessary for timely detection, identification and defeat of the enemy in this zone. The first step was to restore and modernise the system of ISR of the surface situation, including through the integration of capabilities available in other government agencies. In this context, it is particularly important to note the purchase of the multifunctional radar complex ‘Mineral-U’, created by the Ukrainian State Scientific Research Institute of Radar Systems Quantum-Radiolocation. ‘Mineral-U’ is designed for detection in active and passive modes and classification of surface targets at up to 500–600 km. It is mounted on a truck platform, is highly mobile and adapted for close interaction with the anti-ship missile complex ‘Neptune’, which became widely known after the sinking of the Russian cruiser Moskva on 13 April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed by the Ukrainian design bureau ‘Luch’, the coastal mobile missile complex RK-360 ‘Neptune’ was an important component of the navy’s modernisation, along with the development of coastal artillery, the provision of mine-blocking actions and the conduct of radio-electronic warfare. With a range of up to 280 km, manoeuvrability and sea-skimming capabilities, the Neptune can be considered a critical element of the overall Ukrainian maritime defence strategy. The first battalion of Neptune complexes was to be received in April 2022. The Russian aggression forced the accelerated transfer of systems but did not allow the full use of the capabilities of the complex in the first weeks of the invasion, as the crew still needed some time for final preparation. A serious challenge for the navy was also the lack of a sufficient number of missiles for the complexes. However, Ukraine’s receipt of Harpoon anti-ship missile systems as part of Western military-technical assistance, which are very similar to the Neptune, solved this problem and provided confidence in the ability of the navy to deter Russia in the northwestern part of the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessments-and-dispositions&quot;&gt;Assessments and Dispositions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having given an overview of the capabilities of the UAF in some critical areas prior to the invasion, it becomes possible to properly outline the resources available and thus prioritisation decisions that underpinned their dispositions prior to 24 February. The General Staff of the UAF had conducted extensive exercises and wargames to assess how to orchestrate the defence of the country against a wide range of contingencies. Despite having identified methods for defending all relevant axes, however, the limited number of available units without full mobilisation meant that the weighting of units had to be driven by an assessment of enemy intent. It is also important to emphasise that the economic impact of full mobilisation made this very difficult for the Ukrainian government in the face of a sustained threat that could delay major attacks for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until days before the full-scale Russian invasion, the intelligence community of Ukraine broadly assessed that the most dangerous enemy course of action was a high-intensity offensive against Donbas in late February 2022, with the Russians using the destruction of the Ukrainian forces in the JFO area as a means of destabilising the Ukrainian state. The most likely enemy course of action was assessed to be a prolonged period of political destabilisation to create favourable conditions for a military offensive in the early summer, with the main effort being against Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors contributed to the assessment that Donbas would be the main effort, despite extensive warnings from Ukraine’s international partners that Kyiv would be the enemy’s main effort. First, an assessment of Russian forces north of Kyiv concluded that they lacked sufficient troops to effectively isolate and seize the city. The offensive was therefore viewed as a diversionary deployment, aimed at drawing and fixing Ukrainian forces away from Donbas. As the terrain north of Kyiv was highly unfavourable for a major attack, it was assessed that Russia’s attempt to draw Ukraine to concentrate on this axis would make Kyiv disproportionately vulnerable from the east. Second, interception of communications and observation of the Russian units on the Gomel axis confirmed that the personnel did not believe they were going to war and were not prepared for major combat operations. The disconnect between strategic-level discussion that emphasised the threat to Kyiv – shared with Ukraine by Western partners – with this tactical picture, supported the belief that there was a strategic influence campaign that did not reflect the tactical preparations being made by Russian units. In this sense, it is worth emphasising that the Russian deception plan was largely successful through the information security measures taken, but that the impact on the combat effectiveness of Russian troops through a failure to brief them with sufficient time to prepare came at considerable cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence of Kyiv was seen as a necessary contingency for the UAF to plan against and, as the conflict came closer, the threat to this axis was perceived to have increased. Nevertheless, since Donbas was anticipated to be the main axis, over 10 combat brigades, constituting around half of the manoeuvre forces of the UAF, were kept in the JFO area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Donbas, Ukraine held forces around Kharkiv, Dnipro, Sumy and Odesa, a manoeuvre brigade and two artillery brigades in Kyiv, and units in training areas. There were no major formations committed forwards on the Gomel axis. Nor were there any major units committed to defend the approach from Crimea, even though this was specified in the national defence plan. The reasons for this are currently subject to an investigation. TDF were nascent, only had light weapons and were not yet fully integrated into the military command. Ukraine’s defence plans therefore aimed at a high-intensity defence in the direction of Donbas lasting six weeks, giving time for full-scale mobilisation of the reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major threat, identified before the conflict, relevant to the defence of Kyiv or Donbas, was Russia’s long-range strike arsenal. As a result, beginning one week prior to the invasion and accelerated 72 hours before, munitions stockpiles were dispersed from the main arsenals. Aircraft and air-defence systems were also dispersed hours before the invasion. As it became apparent that the Gomel axis was the enemy’s main effort and that another group of forces would strike through Chernihiv, a redeployment of Ukrainian forces was ordered approximately seven hours prior to the invasion. This took considerable time. The result was that many Ukrainian units were not at their assigned defensive positions when the invasion began and, especially on the northern axes, were not in prepared positions. Redeployments from the southern axis towards Kyiv also left fewer troops to hold the coast. Ukrainian units found themselves in a meeting engagement with the enemy. The critical point here is that the war started with the AFRF holding the initiative at the operational level but with their tactical units surprised by what they were being ordered to do. The UAF found themselves surprised at the operational level but with tactical units which had been psychologically and practically preparing for this fight for eight years. The interaction between these variables would be decisive in determining the outcome of the first 72 hours of fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-invasion&quot;&gt;III. The Invasion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having assessed the plans and dispositions of the opposing forces, this chapter outlines what occurred during the initial phases of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shock-and-mutual-surprise-d03&quot;&gt;Shock and Mutual Surprise: D+0–3&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invasion began with a massive fire-strike campaign across Ukraine. The strikes were preceded by the widespread application of electronic attack to disrupt and damage defensive radar and air-defence installations, along with the extensive use of aerial decoys to saturate the defences. This was followed by the employment of cruise and ballistic missiles launched from sea-, air-, and ground-based launch systems. In addition, Russian aircraft penetrated Ukrainian airspace to strike tactical targets. The Russian High Value Target list quite logically included industrial facilities, fuel and energy storage facilities, air-defence sites, C2 infrastructure, ammunition storage points and troop assembly areas, as consistent with Russian doctrine. It was noted that during the first two weeks, Ukrainian transport infrastructure was not targeted, except when it was required by a tactical situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some peculiarities to the order and effectiveness of this initial Russian fires campaign. For example, while the Russians had accurately mapped a large number of military sites, there were very few engagements against tactical groupings of forces, with the preponderance of strikes being at maximum depth and then working backwards towards Ukraine’s tactical echelons. As the tactical elements were the most mobile, however, this sequencing maximised the time available for tactical elements to displace. Furthermore, the Russian lists appeared to be linear and unresponsive to updated information. Many strikes were struck that had not been military positions for years. Moreover, against moving targets, new detections would apparently be added to the target list, without removing the previous reported location, so that dynamic strikes were often delivered too late. Furthermore, the number of munitions assigned to each target appeared to bear little correlation to the size of the target, suggesting limited familiarity with the effects of these classes of munitions among Russian planners. The result was that within the first 48 hours, approximately 75% of stationary Ukrainian Air Defence sites were engaged. At the same time, the estimated percentage for mobile air-defence sites was only about 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of the Russian strikes was greater than the number of platforms destroyed, however. Given the orders to redeploy Ukrainian forces, the damage and disruption to C2, the unexpected concentration on the Gomel axis, and the forced displacement of systems, many Ukrainian systems were alive, but uncoordinated for the initial 24 hours. A significant proportion of the air-defence infrastructure survived but was not in a position to conduct a coordinated defence. Instead, it largely delivered pop-up attacks against Russian forces. This suppression effect meant that for the first phase of the war, the success rate of interceptions of Russian cruise missiles, for example, was around 12–18%. Given that this rose to 40–60% in the second phase of the conflict, the effect of both the scale of the Russian strikes and the impact of dislocation on the effectiveness of the defence can be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian successes were disproportionately weighted to certain axes. The majority of available air-defence coverage for the southern coast around Kherson and Mykolaiv, for example, was destroyed or suppressed. Two air-defence sites responsible for screening the Dnipro River from the north were also destroyed, opening a gap in the defences which enabled the conduct of an air assault against Hostomel from Belarus. In addition to the dislocation caused by missile strikes, Russian aircraft flew sorties to strike specified targets along the axes of advance for their respective groups of forces. This further dislocated the positions of the air-defence forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important element of the Russian plan to disorganise Ukraine’s military C2 system was also to neutralise the top military leadership of the UAF. Thus, in the first days of the invasion, a large number of Ukrainian generals received personal messages from Russian military leaders urging them to surrender and assuring them that Russia did not intend to do any harm to Ukraine. Messages of similar content, but sent from anonymous numbers, were received by almost all colonels and other senior officers of the UAF. The strategic importance of this campaign is evidenced by the fact that on the second day of the invasion, Putin publicly appealed to the Ukrainian military to not resist the Russian invasion. This failed campaign also highlights the poor assessment of the psychology of the Ukrainian military by the Russian special services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical weakness of the Russian strike campaign was battle damage assessment. First, the Russian military appears to have presumed that if an action had been ordered and carried out then it had succeeded, unless there was direct evidence to the contrary. Evidence of success appears to have disproportionately relied on three data points: confirmation from pilots that they hit their target; confirmation from Russian satellites that a site showed damage; and confirmation from signals intelligence (SIGINT) that Ukrainians reported a strike and damage to their equipment. Russian satellite reconnaissance proved very limited, even though Russian survey space reconnaissance of Ukraine has been conducted since at least 2012, and detailed reconnaissance, in the interests of invasion planning, since mid-2021. A probable reason for this may be the insufficient number of satellites in the orbital grouping of the VKS and the overestimation of their technical capabilities. Indirect confirmation of this explanation is provided by the fact that the AFRF began buying additional satellite images of the territory of Ukraine and individual military facilities on the world market in April 2022. One of the visible failures of satellite intelligence is the inability to detect on time a significant volume of strategic railway movements by the UAF, which, in March 2022 amounted to three–four echelons per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poor Russian battle damage assessment process made the Russian military highly vulnerable to deception, which has been consistent throughout the conflict. Early strikes on Ukrainian airfields, for example, destroyed many hangars. By photographing this damage and printing the resulting pattern on to sheets, it became possible to clear the rubble and erect covers for aircraft to return to the site, sheltering in positions that the Russians would confirm as destroyed. This led – somewhat amusingly – to the Russians debating whether Ukrainian fighter aircraft were operating from subterranean shelters at several sites. Repeated strikes on dummy air-defence positions also saw a considerable wastage of ammunition, while Ukrainian troops could confirm that sites were destroyed over the radio even when they were still functioning, causing Russian aircraft to ignore air-defence systems in their mission planning. The already-publicly reported use of dummy HIMARS (high mobility artillery rocket system) later in the war to lure Russian fires is indicative of the systematic use of deception to ensure survivability by the UAF, and it has proven widely effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presumption of success caused the Russian military to take several unjustifiable risks in the disposition of its forces during the first 72 hours of the conflict. Aircraft did not fly with EW pods during the opening phase as they were not deemed necessary following the presumed success of the strike campaign. Similarly, Russian manoeuvre forces were not properly supported by air-defence units and Russian air-defence units were told to presume that aircraft were friendly. This enabled a significant number of ground-attack sorties by the Ukrainian Air Force, including using UAVs such as TB2, against Russian formations, even when they had attached air-defence units. Ukraine suffered aircraft losses in air-to-air engagements, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The penetration of Ukrainian territory by Russian air-assault units on the first day of the invasion deserves special consideration given its significance in the overall plan. Air-assault troops were landed at Hostomel in two waves, each comprising 10 helicopters. These followed the course of the Dnipro River from Belarus to remain below air-defence coverage and successfully reached their objective. In the first wave, two helicopters were shot down at Hostomel by MANPADS. This incident highlights the vulnerability of helicopters to MANPADS as, even under optimal conditions, there is little ability to prevent losses. The assault on Hostomel also highlights why air assault against positions – rather than axes – is extremely dangerous. Upon landing, the Russian VDV came under heavy artillery fire and were subsequently cleared from the airfield by a mechanised counterattack. Similar operations attempted in southern Ukraine and attempts to insert special forces in western Ukraine were unsuccessful for similar reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The behaviour of Russian Ground Forces during the first three days of the war – which differed considerably from pre-war expectations, from their orders and from doctrine – require some explanation. For reasons of operational security, orders were not distributed until 24 hours before the invasion to most units. As a result, Russian troops lacked ammunition, fuel, food, maps, properly established communications and, most critically, a clear understanding at the tactical level of how their actions fitted into the overall plan. It is not so much the case that tactical Russian commanders are incapable of initiative or mission command, but rather that they lacked the detailed instructions of their commanders’ intent or their role within the wider battle plan to make such decisions. Instead, by the time instructions reached battalion tactical groups (BTGs), what had begun as detailed operational planning descended into orders to reach specific locations within a specified timeframe. Confirming the notion that the conventional military component of the invasion was intended as a supporting demonstration of power rather than the main effort, Russian units were ordered to proceed in administrative column, and to bypass UAF units. Many Russian soldiers arrived in towns without their weapons loaded. They were – for the most part – not anticipating heavy fighting. Furthermore, old maps and a lack of time to coordinate the activity of tactical units led many units to move along the same roads, rapidly becoming intermingled, choking up key junctions and slowing down the rate of advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UHichWc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed and conception of the Russian advance posed grave dangers for the UAF. Russian Ground Forces made rapid progress towards Kyiv from Gomel where there were in any case very few Ukrainian troops. The axis past Chernihiv also posed major challenges as Ukrainian forces were caught between their positions, while the orders to bypass resistance left many Ukrainian units cut off, behind Russian lines. The UAF made three decisions at this stage that proved important. First, a large portion of Ukraine’s special forces and the special units of Ukraine’s Special Services were committed on the Gomel axis. Second, Ukraine mobilised reserve units, which rapidly created new battalions near Kyiv. Third, the UAF mobilised its cadets and the teaching staff of its military academies to force-generate additional infantry battalions. In this way a new group of forces was formed within the opening week of the conflict, supported by the two brigades of artillery held in Kyiv and one mechanised brigade. Even with these efforts, the Russians achieved a 12:1 force ratio advantage on the Gomel axis. Similarly, around Chernihiv, the 1st Tank Brigade found itself encircled and lacking infantry support, necessarily drawing on territorial defence units and reservists to adopt a position of all-round defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Donbas, the Russian operations to fix the bulk of the UAF proved almost entirely successful. Although the AFRF made little progress against the defensive positions along the line of contact, it proved impossible for Ukrainian troops to be redeployed from this theatre. To the south, the Russian breakout from Crimea proceeded in a manner consistent with the Russian invasion plan, with Melitopol and Kherson seized with minimal fighting and significant progress made in achieving the encirclement of Mariupol to bring the city under a state of siege. Russian progress towards Kharkiv proved entirely contrary to their plan and their forces were repulsed with heavy casualties. Initially Russian special forces entered the city in light vehicles, only to be isolated. When offered an opportunity to surrender, these personnel claimed that the Ukrainian defenders would soon be the ones surrendering once larger combat units arrived. The disparity in preparedness between these special forces’ groups and their conventional supporting units, however, hindered their coordination and the advanced parties were subsequently destroyed, while Russian forces transitioned to a deliberate break-in against the city, supported by widespread artillery strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above, it is important to recognise that the Russians achieved surprise and succeeded in bringing about highly favourable force ratios on their main axes. On the second day of the conflict, there was considerable anxiety in the UAF as to the ability to halt the advance from Gomel. In understanding why the Russians stalled, despite having the means and forces to push through the small Ukrainian units in front of them, it is necessary to consider the psychological state of the Russian troops. These troops were largely moving in administrative formations. They lacked a clear understanding of where they were. Whole towns did not exist when the maps they were using were made. They had not anticipated heavy fighting, nor did they have established communications to report the situation or to receive updated instructions. Ukrainian forces found themselves bypassed and often confronted with columns of unprepared Russian troops. Even without higher instructions, the immediate task was clear to these units, and, at the tactical level, Ukrainian forces therefore retained the tactical initiative. For the 1st Tank Brigade, for example, the first days of fighting saw numerous meeting engagements in forests at around 100–200-m range, where restricted movement limited the Russian ability to bring their mass to bear against a specific tactical situation. Better crew training combined with short-ranged engagements where their armament was competitive, and the faster autoloader on the T-64, allowed Ukrainian tank crews to achieve significant damage against surprised Russian units. Another example of the problem was that Russian units would arrive in towns and begin to try to engage with the civilian population to understand where they were. Their position would be reported and the Russian unit would be engaged with artillery. This contrast between expectations and reality induced panic and caused the abandonment of equipment that was widely observed on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-battle-for-kyiv-d437&quot;&gt;The Battle for Kyiv: D+4–37&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By D+3, it was apparent to Russian commanders that their plan had gone seriously wrong. It was evident that Ukraine’s air defences were still operational, that the Russian Ground Forces had stalled, and that there was fierce resistance. Moreover, it was apparent that the activities of the special services in Kyiv aimed at neutralising Ukraine’s political leadership – critical to Russia’s theory of victory – were failing as the Security Service of Ukraine identified, isolated and destroyed their infiltrated groups. In fact, as Ukraine mobilised, repositioned its forces, and as its air defences recovered from their initial displacement and surprise, the defence was hardening. There was therefore a need to transition from attempting the coup de main to deliberate combat operations to defeat the UAF. This transition in the Russian posture began on D+3 with a progressive improvement in the enemy’s cohesion over the following month. However, it took considerable time for Russian commanders to understand what was happening, to assert control over their units, or to adapt their tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fastest component of the Russian force to adapt was the VKS. From D+3, Russian aircraft began to change their tactics. Rather than flying single sorties to strike pre-designated targets, large strike packages of interceptors and aircraft armed with anti-radiation missiles would form up in an attempt to provoke Ukrainian air defences into illuminating. These would then be suppressed with anti-radiation missiles and hunted by Russian aircraft or helicopters at low level. The latter suffered heavy attrition to MANPADS employing these tactics and the depth of aviation operations gradually diminished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian transition to low-level hunting tactics coincided with the steady activation of air-defence complexes to protect Russian armed forces’ manoeuvre formations. At this time, Ukrainian air defences deconflicted from the Ukrainian Air Force’s interdiction missions by time, so that MiG-29s would conduct defensive counter-air sorties in pairs as the air defences displaced. This proved problematic because it was difficult to distribute awareness of these phases to deployed infantry with MANPADS. Both Russian and Ukrainian aircraft were threatened by friendly fire at this time. As a result, the deconfliction of air interdiction from Ukraine’s air defences was changed to a spatial approach, with areas in depth assigned to defensive counter-air patrols and areas to the rear assigned to air-defence forces. For a time, Ukrainian pilots were able to engage their Russian adversaries in air-to-air engagements, although they often found themselves outnumbered 6:2. Nevertheless, Ukrainian aircraft did inflict some losses in these engagements, despite losing several aircraft, reflecting the comparatively low training of most Russian pilots. In the first weeks of the invasion, when Russian forces neglected the need to provide air cover, long Russian convoys were also subjected to air strikes by both Air Force and Army aircraft, including Su-24M/MR bombers, Su-25 attack aircraft, Mi-24 and Mi-8 helicopters, and Bayraktar TB2 UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By D+10, defensive counter-air missions became harder to mount. Russian A50-M orbits ensured that the VKS had ample early warning of Ukrainian air movements. As Russian EW complexes began to be deployed systematically, Ukrainian pilots found that they often had their air-to-ground and air-to-air communications jammed, their navigation equipment suppressed, and their radar knocked out. The use of jamming pods on Russian aircraft also increased. Combined with an intensifying threat from air-defence systems, the Ukrainian Air Force progressively lost access to parts of the occupied territories. Close air support and the use of strike UAS also became impossible over much of the battle space owing to dense EW and air-defence coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rapid improvement in the performance and organisation of the VKS is noteworthy because these units were flying from inside Russia’s operational depth and did not therefore suffer from the confusion that was engulfing Russia’s Ground Forces in Ukraine, slowing their adaptation to the circumstances on the ground. Another good indication that the intent of Russian commanders shifted fairly rapidly is the decision by the Russian command not to commit its maritime assault forces, which had been intended to conduct landings between Mykolaiv and Odesa. To conduct the amphibious landing, two amphibious detachments of three large amphibious ships were formed. For the landing in the first wave, units of the 810th Marines Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet and the 336th Marines Brigade of the Baltic Fleet were initially planned. With small breaks, the amphibious forces manoeuvred in the Black Sea until the beginning of April 2022. After the initial reconnaissance landing by Russian special forces in the first days of the invasion with flat-bottomed raiding craft destroyed and heavy casualties, the Russian command determined to refrain from launching this attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those Russian ground units already in Ukraine, adaptation was slower. It is worth exploring why. The standard Russian approach to the formation of BTGs provided for the allocation of one or two BTGs from the composition of the full-time brigade or regiment. In forming, or more precisely, collecting, even one BTG from the brigade for a short-term military operation, the command tried to appoint the best personnel to its composition and distribute the best weapons and equipment for its mission. By itself, the BTG, in the understanding of the Russian command, was more like a ‘reinforced battalion’. The main difference with such a reinforced battalion compared with a permanent combined arms formation is that approximately half of its personnel, and the unit commanders, largely saw each other up close for the first time in their lives on the amalgamation of the BTG. One can only assume how much the relevant commanders were informed about the level of training, experience and equipment of such a unit. At best, they had to rely on the reports of the commanders of regular units about the readiness of their distributed forces and their capacity to perform tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to BTGs being units that had not trained together and lacking staff who knew one another, they were also non-uniform in their composition. These deviations did not appear to derive from the tasks they were assigned but instead arose from the equipment available from the units that generated them. Yet, to commanders at higher echelons, the Russian battle management appeared to treat all BTGs as comparable units of action with no tailoring of tasks to their respective capabilities. When military advances are used as a mere demonstration of force this would not have been critical. But once the force tried to transition to fighting, units were now assigned tasks for which they were poorly equipped. As an example, consider the composition of two BTGs, which operated in almost the same area in the east of Ukraine at the end of April 2022. One of them was from the 228th Motor Rifle Regiment of the 90th Armoured Division of the Central Military District (Svatove district): 23 APCs; six tanks; a 122-mm self-propelled artillery battery; three MLRS BM-21 ‘Grad’; up to 40 vehicles; and about 400 personnel. Another was from the composition of the 57th Motor Rifle Brigade of the 5th Army of the Eastern Military District (Rubizhne district): more than 30 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs); 14 tanks; a 122-mm self-propelled artillery battery; a 152-mm self-propelled artillery battery; a MLRS BM-21 ‘Grad’ battery; up to 60 vehicles; and about 800 personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confusion as to the location and composition of units combined with significant deviation from their pre-assigned tasks led to paralysis in command decisions and no new statement of intent being provided to tactical commanders to rationalise their own decisions. A combination of a lack of time to exchange encryption keys on radios, the effects of Ukrainian EW, poor training on communications equipment and the reversion to stealing cellular communications from local citizens allowed Ukrainian forces to monitor a significant quantity of Russian tactical communications. For the period of March, most of the radio exchanges of Russian troops at the brigade-BTG level consisted of information about the locations of units and individual elements, and only 10–20% related to combat management. Later, Friendly Force Information Requirements only partially considered the monitoring of the needs of class III and V supply which, in turn, created problems with ready supply and imposed loads on the control networks. This not only saw significant supply problems but also the nature of the traffic enabled Ukrainian forces to accurately target Russian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of understanding of Russian commanders as to the location or condition of their units and the lack of situational awareness of their tactical commanders near Kyiv and Kherson in March–April 2022 invariably led to the movement of newly arrived units along the same routes, repeated attempts to conduct already-exposed manoeuvres, the use of the same locations for temporary staging, and the overreliance on a small number of main supply routes. Even in the maritime theatre, this sticking to proven routes enabled a strike in early March using BM-21 Grad by the Ukrainian Marines on a Russian patrol boat at sea. Conversely, communication with 1st Tank Brigade was maintained along a small supply road running northwards on the left bank of the Dnipro that the Russians failed to sever, despite having an overwhelming force presence. This speaks to the poor situational awareness and lack of active patrolling by Russian units. The breakdown of communications also prevented units bringing up equipment to resolve a range of unforeseen tactical dilemmas. From an operational point of view, Russian intelligence obviously did not foresee the use of hydrotechnical structures for the improvement of existing natural barriers. An example of this is the slow response by Russian troops to the use of hydraulic structures on the Irpin River, which made it possible to raise the water level by 0.5–0.7 m and turn the small river into a significant obstacle for the Russian troops who were rushing to Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This general confusion among Russia’s Ground Forces gradually eased towards the end of March as senior officers came forward to establish situational awareness. In the meantime, however, on the axes approaching Kyiv, Ukrainian forces had effectively screened the flanks of the Russian force, which was in any case concentrated in too narrow an area for the number of troops pushed forwards. This unfavourable battlefield geometry made it impossible for the Russians to build up significant momentum, as they came under sustained and intense artillery fire throughout the month. By the time Colonel General Chaiko, commanding the Eastern Group of Forces, had re-established a clear picture of the battlespace, he faced a choice to break through Ukrainian lines and sever the roads to the west of Kyiv, or else withdraw. Initially the Russian forces attempted the former course of action. Unable to bring significant artillery or ammunition forward, however, they took massive casualties and, pressed from both flanks, were at risk of encirclement. When it became apparent that the Central Group of Forces was going to fail to invest Kyiv from the left bank, the decision was taken to withdraw from the Gomel axis and recover the troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Central Group of Forces, attacking via Chernihiv towards Kyiv, and via Sumy, faced a different dilemma. Having bypassed large Ukrainian combat units, while attempting to traverse over 200 km of densely wooded terrain, these forces had dissipated much of their combat power and were suffering heavily in ambushes and meeting engagements. Here the tactical initiative of Ukrainian tactical units and special forces inflicted heavy casualties. Given the use of Chernihiv as a strongpoint in all-round defence, the Central Group of Forces had the choice, once control had been re-established over its combat units, to either concentrate to reduce these positions to its rear, or else to screen these positions and continue towards the original objective, which was Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial success of the Southern Group of Forces slowed considerably as the combat power of this grouping dissipated across multiple axes. The problems that arose in some of the tactical decision-making among this group of forces can be observed from the lack of intent in orders regarding reversionary courses of action. For example, the Southern Group of Forces only encountered serious resistance on reaching Mykolaiv. As on other axes, the Russians achieved an advantageous force ratio and surprise. Available Ukrainian artillery in this sector was limited. Russian forces had also achieved air superiority. Nevertheless, adhering to the orders to bypass centres of resistance, the Russian units proceeded to try and encircle Mykolaiv to the north. In doing so, they dissipated their combat power, gave the Ukrainian Southern Command time to mobilise and organise more units, and left themselves with an exposed flank. As a result, this position became increasingly untenable, although it would take weeks of bitter fighting before Russian combat units stopped trying to push further west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Southern Group of Forces had much more success in closing off Mariupol. Despite many of the Russian tactical actions in this phase of the war, originating with precise and appropriate instructions from higher command, few of these commands could be properly executed. The advance on Mariupol represents an exception, where the higher operational intention to achieve encirclement was properly carried out. Here there was a skilful implementation of preparatory measures to block the communication routes from Mariupol to Volnovaha at D+8 during the encirclement of Mariupol. This set up conditions for the subsequent siege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The destruction of Mariupol – where the Russians had anticipated fierce resistance and were not expecting a rapid surrender by the local authorities – demonstrates the difference that could have been made elsewhere if Russian forces were properly prepared for heavy fighting. Here the model was similar to that used against Grozny in the Second Chechen War: massive employment of fires combined with assault groups to break up defensive positions. The commitment of the 8th Combined Arms Army using BTGs with poor infantry–armour cooperation in the first phase saw significant attrition among Russian units. Nevertheless, Russian forces quickly adapted, forming storm groups of armour and infantry, and creating storm detachments of Chechen troops who proved relatively effective. There were shortcomings in the Ukrainian defence of Mariupol that have since been rectified. The main issue was the establishment of unit boundaries and the division of responsibility between naval, ground and territorial defence forces of the UAF. Russian assault units accurately identified the unit boundaries and were able to exploit these to fracture the defence into several isolated pockets. Given that Russian tactical commanders understood the intent was to seize the city, they were able to effectively implement tactical actions. The longevity of the defence of Mariupol reflects the extraordinary bravery of its defenders. Ukrainian forces not only exceeded the expectations of the Ukrainian General Staff, but also inflicted heavy losses on the Russian attackers. The battlefield geometry, however, of an encirclement deep behind Russian lines, the extensive air defences erected around the city, and the lack of friendly air defences enabled the use of heavy bombers, massive artillery and other means to steadily reduce the defence. Ukraine’s Southern Command has subsequently worked to improve the coordination between Army, TDF and naval units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;refocusing-on-donbas-d3891&quot;&gt;Refocusing on Donbas: D+38–91&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian retreat from Kyiv saw a change in the objectives and strategy of the AFRF. Instead of seeking to seize the capital, Russian forces would endeavour to implement what the UAF had assessed to be their most dangerous course of action from the outset of the conflict: the destruction of the UAF in Donbas; seizure and annexation of Luhansk and Donetsk; and, from this position, force Kyiv to negotiate on unfavourable terms. The focus of Russia’s special services would also shift, from the destabilisation of the Ukrainian government to economic and political warfare against Europe to undermine international support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before describing the nature of the fighting, it is important to take stock of the relative condition of the forces, which were repositioned over the course of April. Russian forces had suffered from massive attrition around Kyiv and had lost a vast quantity of military equipment. Throughout April there was an ongoing debate in the Russian government as to the need for mobilisation. Eventually the decision was made against mobilisation. Alongside attrition, Russian forces were suffering from low morale given their lack of success on most axes. At this point, a peculiar bifurcation occurred in the Russian forces. On the one hand, the higher command was still convinced of the need to fight with the BTG as the preferred unit of action, even if this non-uniform and non-mission-specific grouping differed considerably in capability. Thus, when the offensive against Donbas was undertaken in earnest throughout May 2022, it is estimated that Russian forces were fielding a total of 146 BTGs located around Ukraine, of which 93 were active, 13 were being restored, and 40 were in first- and second-phase reserves. This included the 136 BTGs in the original invasion force and additional units formed from reserves and Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) and Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) conscripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, where the Russians had achieved success, they had formed mission-specific groupings, as in Mariupol. The need for non-uniform formations was also driven by several factors concerning human and material resources. Although the Russians were beginning to recruit new contract soldiers and commit Wagner mercenaries and other units, these groupings were largely organised into company-sized units. Heavy casualties among spetsnaz and air-assault units also led to these troops being fielded in company groups more often than battalions. Moreover, although the mobilisation of conscripts in Luhansk and Donetsk had produced around 35,000 troops, heavy casualties in these formations left them highly irregular. Equipment losses also led to the consolidation of capabilities, so that fewer BTGs fielded their assigned batteries of 152-mm howitzers, with these concentrated into artillery tactical groups instead. Over time, as the Russian military came under strain, its organisational principles were diverted into task-specific organisation, usually of brigade groups with several attached independent companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Materiel and personnel pressures were also shaping the disposition of the UAF between the assault on Kyiv and the offensive on Donbas. Ukrainian casualty figures remain classified and cannot be detailed in this report. Nevertheless, after months fighting outnumbered, the very high number of wounded – representing around 80% of casualties on the Ukrainian side, with around 40% of wounded personnel sustaining permanent injuries – left a number of key units heavily depleted. It was also noted at this time that the UAF did not have an established doctrine nor procedures for rotating units from contact. Units in Donbas, for example, had been under attack for more than a month with no reprieve, and it seemed probable that they would now face the full weight of a Russian offensive. Fatigue and concussion from artillery fire were serious issues best resolved through troop rotations. It became imperative to develop techniques to ensure the rapid circulation of troops. Despite these challenges, morale within Ukrainian units remained high, first, because of the failure of the AFRF to place Kyiv under siege, and second, because while a fight in Donbas would be difficult, it was also something that Ukrainian troops had prepared for over several years, offering confidence in their ability to blunt the Russian offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is briefly worth flagging here a political factor that shaped, and in some ways constrained, Ukrainian military preparations for the defence of Donbas at this time. The discovery of war crimes perpetrated at scale by Russian forces in occupied territories on the axes approaching Kyiv created a political climate in which the surrender of territory, and especially settlements, became politically unacceptable. Given the disparity in forces, a manoeuvre defence would have been most effective from a purely military point of view, enabling the enemy to be shaped and then cut off through counterattack to maximise its losses. However, the human cost of these tactics on the population, whom the UAF were mobilised to defend, would have been unacceptable. Showing that the Army would hold ground for as long as practicable was therefore not only a political imperative, but also important in underpinning the moral component of the fighting force. This is not to argue that political decisions inappropriately had an impact on military decision-making. Instead, it is one of the ongoing strengths of the Ukrainian state that there remains a healthy civil–military discourse and an ability to balance these critical factors. Nevertheless, this led to tactical dispositions that, from a purely military perspective, may have appeared suboptimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest challenge at this stage in the conflict for the UAF was equipment losses and the expenditure of ammunition. Although Western support had been symbolically invaluable in the early stages of the war, the enemy was stopped principally through the employment of Ukrainian arms. Nevertheless, Ukraine had, by this point, exhausted most of its MLRS and heavier-calibre Soviet-era artillery ammunition. By the commencement of the Russian offensive against Donbas, NATO systems were becoming available. However, only small numbers had arrived, while training and support for first- and second-line maintenance was not yet available. For example, many of the M777 howitzers that were delivered became inoperable due to maintenance issues after being misused by crews. Furthermore, there was not yet a structured way for equipment to be provided. Whereas piecemeal deliveries of a wide range of systems was workable for rocket-propelled grenades and other light weapons, it was problematic for heavy weapons such as artillery. With little consolidation of support, Ukraine began to receive a wide variety of equipment types, all of which differed in their maintenance and logistical requirements. The early stages of the offensive on Donbas, therefore, saw the UAF at their most vulnerable from the point of view of equipment. The question was whether materiel support would accelerate sufficiently to meet the imminent threat. While Ukraine managed to maintain artillery parity in the first stage of the war, in the second stage, thanks to the absolute superiority in the volume of ammunition, Russia began to achieve fires dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian offensive on Donbas proceeded in accordance with the sound logic of operational encirclement through attacks to the north and south of the JFO. Although the overall operational concept was sound, it must be noted that no effort was made to disperse Ukrainian forces on to other axes or otherwise present the UAF with competing imperatives. Thus, while the UAF had a shortage of armaments at this time, they also had a very limited and identifiable area where armaments needed to be concentrated. The protracted defence of the Azovstal steel works – long after the rest of Mariupol had fallen – proved important in slowing the release of forces to simultaneously pressure Donbas from the southern axis and thereby further limited the frontages that the UAF had to cover in the first weeks of the offensive. After initial attempts at an armoured breakthrough failed, the Russian military resorted to manoeuvre by fire. The efficiency of this approach was greatly hindered by the unwillingness of their infantry to make deliberate assaults without massive artillery preparation of the targets. It was not uncommon for a company position of the UAF – occupying a frontage of approximately 3 km – to be subjected to 6,000 rounds per day of fire. At this time, the Russians not only had vastly more ammunition than the UAF but also outranged most Ukrainian artillery and the concentration of EW limited the effectiveness of precision fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the concentration of effort on Donbas, Russia set up EW complexes with up to 10 complexes per 20 km of frontage. Collectively, these complexes effectively disrupted navigation along the front, and conducted direction finding to direct artillery and electronic attack against Ukrainian aircraft and UAVs. The use of UAVs during this period deserves special consideration. As the war became dominated by artillery duelling, the importance of rapid target acquisition increased. The narrowing of the contested front and concentration of artillery also offered fewer opportunities for human reconnaissance. Both sides used UAVs extensively throughout the conflict. These ranged from commercial and adapted quadcopters at tactical echelons to fixed-wing reconnaissance UAVs such as the Ukrainian SKIF and Russian Orlan-10. The latter two were especially valuable because they could fly at medium altitude, were too cheap to be economical targets for air defences and provided extensive imagery to enable rapid and responsive fires. Both parties also used large medium-altitude long endurance UAVs such as Ukraine’s TB2s and Russia’s Orion for target acquisition, although these platforms were scarcer, more vulnerable, and therefore only committed under favourable conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the importance of UAVs to remaining competitive, their attrition rates were extremely high. Of all UAVs used by the UAF in the first three phases of the war covered by this study, around 90% were destroyed. The average life expectancy of a quadcopter remained around three flights. The average life expectancy of a fixed-wing UAV was around six flights. Skilled crews who properly pre-programmed the flight path of their UAVs to approach targets shielded by terrain and other features could extend the life of their platforms. However, even when UAVs survived, this did not mean that they were successful in carrying out their missions. UAVs could fail to achieve their missions because the requirements to get them in place – flying without transmitting data, with captured images to be downloaded on recovery, for example – prevented timely target acquisition before the enemy displaced. Furthermore, such a method, while improving survivability, also necessitated the right locations to be preselected for image capture. Many missions failed to find targets because there was no target at the specified location. Alternatively, and more common, was mission failure owing to disruption of a UAV under control through electronic warfare, the dazzling of its sensors or the denial of its navigational systems from determining the accurate location of a target. In other instances, the Russians successfully struck the ground control stations of the UAV. In aggregate, only around a third of UAV missions can be said to have been successful. Here, the Orlan-10 should be singled out in terms of its utility because the cheap platform nevertheless had a high performance and proved difficult to counter, although its inertial navigation makes insufficient account of windage. Even the Russian military, however, found that it did not have enough of these platforms to sustain the loss rate during the battle in Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defeat of precision was critical to unit survival. Defeating precision could be achieved by preventing a launcher from accurately determining its position, even with very small displacements, by preventing the enemy determining the precise location of the target or through direct interference with the mechanism for precision strike. The latter did not always require expensive methods. When Russian reconnaissance troops began to mark Ukrainian defensive positions with laser designators, for example, it was found that having laser warning indicators over strongpoints could alert personnel being targeted, who could then pop smoke grenades to disrupt the accuracy of the strike. This would also blind the defenders, making them vulnerable to assault. Thermal optics, or the targeting of the designating team from another position to relieve the suppression of the targeted post was critical. The experience of the UAF showed that precision artillery was not only disproportionately effective, but also limited the vulnerability of the force by reducing its logistical footprint. Nevertheless, in the early phases of the fighting in Donbas when the UAF had few precision systems, Russian EW reduced the effectiveness of these systems. This disproportionately affected the UAF because the Russians primarily relied on saturation fire from unguided shells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian EW systems were highly effective, there were also noted weaknesses of these complexes. The Russians suffered extensively from these systems having an equally noticeable effect on its own troops. The AFRF have not yet managed to solve this problem, except in the case of some specific platforms such as the Su-34. Furthermore, there were often weaknesses in planning, partly exacerbated by the issue of fratricide. For example, when military communications were suppressed it was often possible to revert to cellular communications channels. Although the Russians have the means to target these communications, the Leer-3 payload carried by an Orlan-10 UAV is hard to synchronise with EW effects that make the use of UAVs exceedingly difficult. Furthermore, although navigational effects disrupted precision, direct jamming against precision systems was rarely effective. It is apparent that the Russians have refined, but done little to develop beyond, Soviet systems and some of their new systems such as the Repellent complex were largely ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this period, the Russians had consolidated much of their artillery into artillery tactical groups and began directing fires from higher headquarters owing to a shortage of trained fire controllers. Russian artillery would tend to operate in batteries a third of their range behind the forward line of own troops (FLOT), with a spacing of 100–150 m between their guns. Missions were usually assigned to the battery, whereas the UAF mostly assign fire missions to guns. Russian units with their own UAVs could deliver highly responsive fires, bringing effect to bear within 3–5 minutes of target detection. For targets that ran through a fire-control headquarters, the Russians continued to add new detections to the bottom of the list and prosecute strikes in order, leading to fire missions taking 20–30 minutes at the tactical level, and around 48 hours at the operational level. Russian artillery would conduct counter-battery fire, but never from the targeted battery. Instead, a targeted battery would immediately displace in the case of MLRS when under fire, or the crews would seek cover until fire lifted and then displace. Counter-battery fire would be assigned to a separate battery. The Russians rarely displaced after firing unless they received fire. This appears to have been because the volume of shells they needed to fire their missions could not be displaced or repositioned quickly, even if the guns could. Given their fires dominance, during this phase, their static approach was not overly costly until longer-range precision systems became available to the UAF, at which point the Russian fires system was severely disrupted. Owing to fire missions being coordinated at a high level, the AFRF at this time also exercised limited discipline in assigning weapons to fire missions but could instead draw on any available weapons system to complete a mission. Thus, Tochka-U were deployed for counter-battery effects. Overall, during the offensive against Donbas, Russian artillery were firing around 20,000 rounds per day, with their peak fire rate surpassing 32,000 rounds on some days. Ukrainian fires rarely exceeded 6,000 rounds a day, reflecting a shortage of both barrels and ammunition. For the offensive on Donbas, the Russians deployed over 1,100 tube artillery pieces with around 80–90 guns usually formed into a group to support the actions of brigade-sized groupings of three to four BTGs. The Russian advantage in artillery during May and June 2022 in Donbas was 12:1. Special attention should be paid to the use of Russian MLRS, including BM-21 Grad, 9K57 Uragan and 9K58 Smerch. Practically all these systems were used at their maximum range; 9K57 and 9K58, in particular, were used at 35–70 km. Despite their doctrinal role, MLRS were used not only on area targets, but also on point targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this overwhelming firepower, the Russians made slow progress. The assault tactics employed by Russian operations evolved over time. Initially there were repeated attempts to make progress using armoured thrusts. A shortage of infantry, and, in particular, of motivated and skilled infantry, led to heavy equipment losses. Thereafter, the Russians resorted to the total saturation of defended areas to compel withdrawal. This created a dilemma for the UAF because if ground was ceded, the Russians would advance, but to prevent it being ceded it was necessary to maintain troops under massive bombardment, with inevitably high casualties. The threat became more acute as the Russians developed more effective means of attack. Rather than uniform BTG manoeuvres, they began to operate in waves. LNR and DNR conscripts would be pushed forwards to skirmish and assault a position, forcing UAF positions to reveal themselves. These would be identified by Russian reconnaissance troops and subjected to precision artillery fire. There would then be a massive artillery bombardment followed by a deliberate assault by more capable troops comprising airborne, spetsnaz or Wagner companies. Notably, spetsnaz during this phase were almost exclusively employed as capable light or sometimes mechanised infantry. Once the UAF withdrew, the Russians would occupy the position with LNR and DNR conscripts and withdraw their more capable forces. This cycle would take one or two days, with the Russians aiming to go firm in the evening to have the night to harden their positions against counterattack. Of course, this process could only ever advance a couple of kilometres per day, and often less, depending on the distance between defence lines. It also incurred heavy Russian casualties, although these were disproportionately concentrated among LNR and DNR conscripts. The Russians also changed their use of armour from thrusts by platoon-sized groups of tanks supported by armoured infantry to using tanks for indirect fire or long-range engagements using barrel-launched ATGMs, copying the preferred approach of the UAF. A lack of training left Russian forces less accurate in applying these methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VKS operations during this time also shifted. Although heavy bombing was carried out in Mariupol, the penetration of Ukrainian airspace had declined after the withdrawal from Kyiv, other than with long-range precision fires. The VKS however recommenced the delivery of frontline effects as the offensive in Donbas got under way. This usually saw a fourship of Russian aircraft approach the Ukrainian air-defence zone at medium altitude, applying EW effects or launching anti-radiation missiles if Ukrainian radar illuminated. At the same time, a twoship of aircraft would approach the air-defence zone at very low level and usually conduct strikes with unguided munitions, including indirect rocket attacks after lofting. This technique – also applied by the Ukrainian Air Force and Army Aviation – could be effective in saturating an area target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than close air support, the VKS’s main effort was in releasing long-range precision fires from inside Russian airspace. Strategic aviation of the VKS comprising Tu-22M3 (Backfire) and Tu-95MS (Bear) long-range bomber aircraft operated as launch platforms for Kh-22/Kh-32 (AS-4 Kitchen) and Kh-55/Kh-555 (AS-15 Kent) from the first days of the war and proved to be effective. The first strikes with the use of air-launched missiles were noted on D+3 and continued throughout the conflict. For the period from February to the beginning of May 2022, approximately 180 Kh-22/32 and Kh-55/555 launches were recorded. Beyond air-launched effects, however, there was a marked difference in the pattern of long-range precision fires from the first phase of the war to the offensive on Donbas. The main portion of strategic, and sometimes operational, fire missions until the beginning of April 2022 was performed by the short-range ballistic missile systems 9M720 and 9M723 Iskander (SS-26 Stone). For the period from February to the beginning of May 2022, more than 200 missile strikes by this system were recorded. Missile strikes were conducted deep into the territory of Ukraine, up to the regions near the border with Poland. More than 160 civilian and military objects were hit. While Ukrainian Air Defences were effective at intercepting cruise missiles throughout the war, 9M720 proved exceedingly difficult to intercept, and 9M723 was almost impossible to manipulate via other means. The situation changed from D+14–16, when the number of SS-26 Stone employments significantly reduced, and at the beginning of April 2022, the Russians shifted from salvo to single strikes. The likely reason for this may be a shortage of missiles, the stocks of which were calculated for a short-term strategic operation. Russian industry has the capacity to manufacture six 9M723s per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the offensive on Donbas, although long-range precision fires continued, the Russians increasingly relied on obsolete systems. Target types that were struck with 9M720 earlier in the conflict were instead engaged, from April 2022, with the short-range ballistic missile system 9K79 (SS-21 Scarab A). A similar transition occurred with the employment of naval fires. For example, from D+60–65 there was a transition from target types that were previously engaged with Kalibr 3M-14K (SS-N-27 Sizzler), instead being engaged with 3K60 Bal (SSC-6 Sennight) and 3K55 Bastion (SSC-5 Stooge) coastal missile systems. The consequence of this inappropriate employment of munitions was reduced accuracy and, in many cases, the tragic striking of civilian structures. The main operational impact of these strikes on Ukrainian cities was to force Ukrainian air defences to be spread over a wide geographic area, limiting protection of the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continued threat from strikes originating in the Black Sea further stretched Ukrainian air and missile defences. Although the sinking of the Russian warship Moskva on 13 April 2022 caused the Russian Black Sea Fleet, other than fast attack craft, to move its operations further from the Ukrainian coast, the Russian Navy could still functionally perform two of its defined tasks. It could no longer approach the coast and threaten landings. However, Russian ships and submarines continued to deliver long-range missile strikes against southern and western Ukraine, while the transition from a close to a distant blockade did not fundamentally alter the economic isolation of Ukraine’s ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volume of fires delivered on the front in Donbas led progressively to the total destruction of defensive positions until they were no longer viable. This led, in mid-June, to the decision to withdraw from Severodonetsk. At this time, the Russian system of war was effectively inflicting casualties and taking ground from the UAF, but it also had several key dependencies and therefore vulnerabilities. The most prominent of these was its sustainment. The supply of fuel for the groupings of the AFRF in Ukraine was more a task of its delivery than a matter of availability. To solve this problem, a historically proven approach was mainly used: the exploitation of railways. The volume of transportation was large. For example, in just the period 1–19 April 2022, and only to the railway station of Rovenki (Luhansk region), 228 railway cisterns with fuel and lubricants (more than 13,600 tonnes) were moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the supply of ammunition, the Russian command used the classic system provided for by doctrinal documents. Its essence is in a multi-level delivery and distribution from brigade to battalion to company/battery. However, during the strategic operation against Ukraine, the function of the ‘brigade link’ had to be performed by divisional- and army-level logistics units because of the volume of materiel moved. The Russians were forced to reorganise their logistics at D+7 upon realising that the conflict would protract significantly beyond their initial planning assumption. The ammunition supply system was based on two organisational solutions. The first was that the supply of ammunition relied on a network of deployed so-called ‘field artillery depots’. Each of them turned out to be a complex of civilian industrial buildings adapted for the storage of ammunition. Such warehouses usually stored no more than two–three ammunition basic loads for an attached group of troops. One such warehouse could supply ammunition to units within a radius of 30–50 km. The second solution provided for the maximum accumulation of ammunition directly in units (company/battery-battalion/artillery battalion). This stimulated the dispersion of stocks and allowed for autonomy of actions in case of disruption of planned delivery. However, it also increased the probability of the destruction of stocks and reduced the tactical ability of artillery units to shoot-and-scoot, since they had large ammunitions stocks at their positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the requirements of Russian doctrine, which is essentially a carbon copy of the Soviet ones, the location of the main support elements and reserves of the divisional and army units is situated at a depth of up to 50 km from the line of contact. It is likely that such a requirement is justified for the conditions of dense operational order of battle with reliable cover of such elements by air defence. The practice of war in Ukraine showed something different – a decentralised operational structure and separate directions for advance. But the Russian command, for reasons not fully understood, continued to follow the doctrinal position unchanged, for more than 60 days. As a result, the specified objects regularly became targets for damage by the long-range MLRS BM-30 Smerch and Tochka-U – fired by the UAF. Only at the end of April 2022 was the concentration of a significant part of the personnel, equipment and materiel moved beyond the 50-km (later 100-km) security zone, based on the maximum range of weapons of the UAF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From D+20–30 the Russians began to secure and exploit surviving rail infrastructure in the occupied territories for the transportation of troops and materiel. Understanding the importance of rail transportation, primarily from the point of view of efficiency, the Russian command managed to ensure the unloading of military echelons 30–50 km from the line of contact in most directions. An understandable condition for this was its repair, restoration and protection with the involvement of military units of the Railway Troops of the Russian Armed Forces. For example, since May 2022, as part of the logistical support for the conduct of actions by Russian troops, the MLZH-VF-VT pontoon rail bridge was installed by the 29th Brigade of Railway Troops of the Western Military District near the destroyed rail bridge in Kupyansk (Kharkiv region), across the Oskil River. This was connected to the main railway by the Kupyansk-Vuzlovy–Vovchansk branch. To ensure adequate protection of rail communications, on the southern axes, Russian troops used such exotic means as armoured trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Russian logistics system was chaotic in the first phase of the war, the structural efficiency of the approach ensured consistent supply throughout the offensive on Donbas. However, the dependence on fixed rail infrastructure, the viable distances from the known railheads to the field depots, and the lack of manoeuvrability of units because of their materiel-heavy concept of operations all exposed the force to systemic vulnerabilities. The mapping of depots and unit support areas, once Ukraine obtained long-range precision fires through military-technical assistance, allowed for the systematic targeting of this logistics infrastructure and through this means the denial of the Russian concept of operation. The introduction of HIMARS and M270 firing GMLRS into the UAF therefore can be seen as the point where the Russian offensive on Donbas ended and the war entered a new phase. The character of the summer fighting involves many elements that remain operationally relevant, and, to that end, it is inappropriate to discuss this phase of the war at this stage. In due course, it will be possible to discuss the Ukrainian preparation for offensive operations. Nevertheless, what has been discussed already provides a rich body of data from which lessons can be identified as to the structural strengths and weaknesses of the AFRF and wider lessons about modern combat for NATO forces. These are considered in the following chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-assessing-russian-military-performance-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;IV. Assessing Russian Military Performance in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before 24 February 2022, Russia’s potential adversaries, through professional respect, assumed that Russian forces would employ their capabilities with a basic level of competence. But the size of their forces, sustained investment, their available firepower and the proficiency with which the AFRF had conducted smaller-scale operations in preceding years led to an overestimation of Russia’s actual military capabilities. There was also an overriding focus on the quantity of equipment, rather than the quality of personnel, their leadership, training and motivations. The general error was to take the best observed Russian performance and set this as the expected standard. This had a pernicious effect on policy by increasing fear of Russian forces among Ukraine’s international partners, which Russia exploited to coerce its adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 24 February 2022, many observers who have not had direct experience of the conflict have overcorrected for their early analytical errors. There is a perception that the AFRF are systemically incompetent, irredeemably corrupt, that their weapons are ineffective and unreliable, and that the force is incapable of adapting. This narrative is dangerous, both because it is inaccurate, and also because it encourages complacency. Ukraine benefited significantly in its preparations by measuring its readiness against Russia’s potential rather than its actual capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operational data outlined above shows that the Russian military suffered from major errors of judgement made by the Russian leadership, special services and the presidential administration. The force also suffers from structural weaknesses in its force design and training system that created specific operational and tactical frictions. It was also a force designed for ‘active defence’ strategic military operations, not for a large-scale attack on another sovereign country without full wartime mobilisation. Nevertheless, the AFRF have already demonstrated that they are able to learn and adapt. They remain highly lethal, determined to achieve the mission set by their president, and employing highly capable weapons systems. In future assessments of Russian capabilities, careful attention should be paid to the extent that they have corrected some of the systemic weaknesses in their force, which they are unlikely to be able to resolve during the current period of aggression. If they can make progress in resolving these issues, the gap between Russian potential and its capabilities may narrow considerably. This chapter outlines these key identified weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-has-a-hierarchy-of-jointery&quot;&gt;Russia Has a Hierarchy of Jointery&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed from the perspective of Russia’s Ground Forces, its military likely appears to be a highly joint organisation. Against Ukraine, the Russian Navy and VKS were both integrated into the campaign plan, adapted as the Russian plan was forced to change, and each contributed to the overall mission. Conversely, it is evident that Russian jointery functions as a hierarchy in which the Navy and VKS are subordinated to the Ground Force’s needs. This was demonstrated in the C2 arrangements during the conflict and the prioritisations of their mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the Russians had both airborne command posts in the form of Il-20 Coot aircraft and AWACS orbits provided by A-50M, the coordination of air operations was subordinated to the military district command posts of the Ground Forces rather than the VKS. Rather than running operations from a central combined air-operations centre, coordination of air tasking was managed by ground-based C2 and planned separately by air armies assigned to support each operational group of forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of Russia’s air campaign is that the initial targets were prioritised according to the extent that they enabled the Ground Force’s seizure of critical infrastructure. After the Ground Forces began to struggle to make progress, Russian airpower shifted from targeting air-defence sites to win control of the air and instead attempted to provide increasing levels of close air support. The depth of penetration decreased and became tied to the Ground Forces’ axes of advance. Thus, not only C2, but also the logic of prioritisation of air targets, was disproportionately shaped by the tactical challenges faced by the Ground Forces, arguably at the expense of the VKS planning to bring about control of the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Russian Navy, the task of blockade may be considered an application of sea power. Beyond this function, however, the Navy’s core tasks were similarly in support of land operations, either to put troops ashore to seize key lines of communication in advance of Ground Forces movements, or to simply provide strike platforms in support of the wider strike campaign, and, in particular, servicing of targets of tactical importance to the Ground Forces moving along Ukraine’s southern coast. The impact on the professionalism and identity of the service from being subordinated to the Ground Forces in this way is hard to measure but must necessarily contribute to the generally low level of seamanship demonstrated by the Moskva, whose radar was stowed when struck. A more effective employment of air and sea power would likely require a greater level of autonomy in planning for the separate branches with the prioritisation of tasks geared towards joint ends rather than subordinate to the logic of land operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-force-generation-is-not-aligned-with-its-concepts-of-operation&quot;&gt;Russian Force Generation is Not Aligned with its Concepts of Operation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet military was structured to fight in regiments, divisions and combined arms armies that also held independent brigades under command. The Russian armed forces have, for over a decade, pursued the concept of a BTG, constituting an all-arms formation with disproportionate enablement. After 2015, it was noted by the Russian General Staff that the BTG construct would not work without the divisional logistics structure sustaining it and, so, brigades and regiments would thereafter generate BTGs which would be supported by the divisional logistics effort and commanded by the associated combined arms army. The BTG would pool the experienced contract troops from the peacetime unit, thereby theoretically increasing the combat power of the forces generated. It would also allow mixed units of conscripts and contractors in peacetime, which was consistent with a training model that saw the upskilling of soldiers conducted in their units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia has attempted, for some time, to shift from a conscript-based force to a fully volunteer force, it has not been able to recruit enough contract soldiers to abandon conscription. Nor has the Russian military adopted a contract structure that retains experienced and educated personnel in positions of junior leadership. This is equivalent to the non-commissioned officer cadre in Western militaries. This makes the BTG construct highly problematic. The battalion staff is insufficient to manage all the enablers that are assigned. Moreover, because this is a composite formation drawing from multiple units and is only generated for operations, there is a lack of familiarity among the personnel in different arms of the BTG. The commander does not know their people. Thus, a small team of sufficiently trained personnel is unable to provide detailed instructions to each of its subordinate elements, but also does not know its subordinates well enough to be able to predict how they will handle brief and incomplete instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further problem with the BTG is its ability to absorb losses. An enabled company group – as a unit of action – either succeeds in its task or fails and can thereafter be rotated out if overly attrited. A BTG, however, because of the level of enablement, can become incapable of executing battalion tasks when key enablers are disproportionately attrited, even if many of its components are still useable. As an example, on 22 April 2022, as a result of engagements in the direction of Kurakhove, a BTG of the 136th Motor Rifle Brigade under the 58th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District was taken out of battle having lost 240 servicemen killed in action, 11 IFVs, four tanks, three self-propelled guns and three MLRS BM-21 ‘Grad’. Statistically, the BTG lost only up to 30% of its initial combat power, and many of its supporting elements were intact. However, as a unit, it was no longer capable of executing the tasks that it was being assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial response to this challenge introduced even more confusion into Russian operations. The units less affected by attrition within a BTG would be removed and assigned to other BTGs so that a new amalgamated formation with the requisite combat power was created. The result was to further intermingle personnel from different units, once again changing the command team and ensuring that commanders had no familiarity with their subordinates. It also created logistical and communications problems as units were cut across from one chain of command to another, creating frictions with encryption keys and compatibility problems, and ensuring that the calibres and thus the sustainment demands within a given formation changed periodically. A further complication was that, because the BTG structure put the most experienced troops and commanders in the first echelon, attrition was disproportionately among those with the most experience and therefore best able to manage the uncertainty of composite and amalgamated formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These frictions may have been manageable with a higher proportion of junior leaders. Instead, the Russian military found that junior commanders were rapidly promoted to fill the critical staffing requirements at battalion and higher levels, denuding companies of effective leadership and technical skills. As the conflict went on, the disparity between the precision and elegance of issued orders from headquarters and their execution widened considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the weaknesses of the BTG were the most evident, similar issues have bedevilled other Russian branches, most notably the VKS. Ukrainian assessments concluded that given limited flight hours and the practice of training being delivered in units, the VKS entered the conflict with fewer than 100 fully trained and current pilots. Combined with a military culture that assigns the most dangerous missions to the most experienced crews, attrition in the VKS has fallen disproportionately on this cadre, reducing the overall effectiveness of the force and its ability to train new pilots. In negotiations over prisoner exchanges, the AFRF have been eager for the return of experienced pilots. The mobilisation of trainers from their flying schools to frontline formations has also hampered the ability to generate new pilots. The Ukrainian military has noted a rise in both very young and very old pilots in the VKS, with ageing pilots returned to frontline service. This has corresponded with a significant reduction in the scale and complexity of VKS air operations over Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict. It is also a problem that has affected ground crews, for example with the discovery of left-on covers on the sensors of Russian aviation operating over Ukraine, an easily avoided mistake which has a severe impact on effectiveness and should be considered negligence. This suggests challenges in discipline and junior leadership among maintenance crews in the VKS. Another demonstration of this poor discipline in the VKS is the routine stacking of munitions next to aircraft on Russian air bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is harder to assess the limitations of the Russian Navy in terms of its force-generation model as there are fewer data points. Nevertheless, the alertness and damage-control capabilities on the Moskva suggest similar deficiencies in junior crew leadership may affect the Navy. The key point here is that Russia has built a force-employment concept that is beyond the capacity of its force-generation model to resource with the appropriate expertise. Key indicators for improvements in Russian military capability therefore will be whether it adjusts its force-generation model, or reconceptualises how it task organises for operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-russian-military-has-a-tendency-to-reinforce-failure&quot;&gt;The Russian Military Has a Tendency to Reinforce Failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first phase of the war, it was apparent that the course of events described in the orders issued to units diverged significantly from developments on the ground. Nevertheless, units continued to seek to execute their orders long after it had become apparent that assumptions in those orders were wrong. This behaviour has continued throughout the war. The continuous attempts to assault Bakhmut, for example, long after it ceased to be on Russia’s main effort, demonstrate that until an order is countermanded commanders will continue to try to execute their last instruction. In the early phases, during offensive operations, this was best demonstrated around Mykolaiv and Chernihiv. In both cases, Russian units had been ordered to bypass resistance to reach their objectives. The orders made clear that resistance was expected to be light. When this assumption was demonstrated to be false, however, Russian commanders continued to seek to bypass strongpoints, even when it degraded their tactical position, exposed their flanks and diluted their combat power by spreading concentrated forces over a long frontage in contact with Ukrainian troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should not be mistaken for a lack of flexibility or adaptability in implementing combat tasks. Russian units often rapidly adapt their methods in response to failure. They also demonstrate creativity within their assigned boundaries. In some contexts, the tendency to lean into a course of action poses dangers to the enemy. Much Western military literature discusses ‘cognitive shaping’ and the use of ‘information manoeuvre’ to divert or alter the enemy’s course of action. These are unlikely to be effective against such a military culture. Similarly, if a force intending to divert an offensive into a killing area is insufficiently strong to blunt the enemy, the response to contact may be – and often is – to lean into the confrontation. If the blocking force is not sufficiently large or lacks firepower, it risks being destroyed, even if it inflicts high casualties, rather than stops the assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of this tendency, it appears clear that anticipating the enemy’s intent and setting dispositions to optimally respond is more important than trying to shape that intent. If an enemy accelerates through a killing area or recommits to an axis even if its intelligence assessment of resistance was unrealistic, anticipating its assigned axis is the best means of placing killing areas in the right location. Conversely, even if a more favourable or apparently advantageous route presents itself, it is unlikely that the unit will deviate from its axis. Cognitive shaping, therefore, must be aimed at operational commanders, with such decisions rarely being made lower than the combined arms army command post. In delivering such a capability, it is essential to understand the theory of victory and higher intent to which the commander is working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further aspect of Russian orders, which is a significant weakness, is the near absence of reversionary courses of action. If unsuccessful, or if the higher intent is no longer achievable, this leads to requests for clarification being referred upwards. Once decisions are made at higher echelons, the lower echelons can alter their actions quickly. The decision to withdraw from Kyiv, for example, saw a rapid break from contact – with varying levels of order – on both main axes. This was largely executed competently. However, in the interval when higher headquarters seek to formulate a plan, paralysis tends to grip lower echelons if their initial orders do not reflect the position on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach has probably had the greatest impact in creating a gap between potential and actual capability as regards Russian fires. All reported contacts are treated as true. All fire missions appear to be given equal priority and are prosecuted in the order in which they are received unless an order to prioritise a specific mission comes from higher authority. It seems that those directing fire missions either do not have access to contextual information or are indifferent to it. In any case, observations of Russian pre-planned fires shows that they will strike targets that have moved and subsequently engage the same target in its new position, suggesting a purely chronological prioritisation of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Russian Navy, a similar dynamic can be observed. The orders to initiate amphibious landings were conditions-based as they were in support of ground forces which never reached the point to justify the action. Thus, these were called off before the forces were committed. However, subsequently, when the sinking of the Moskva enabled the Ukrainian Air Force to re-establish control of the air over Snake Island, it was notable that the Russian Navy continued to try to contest this outpost and the surrounding waters with fast attack boats. Lacking air defence, these were destroyed, mainly with TB2, while Snake Island became denied by Ukrainian long-range fires. Still, the Russian Navy sought to reinforce this failure even though control of the island had no functional impact on its ability to blockade Ukraine’s southern coast. They only stopped reinforcing this failure when higher-level orders accepted abandoning the position. The tendency to reinforce failure was less evident in the VKS, which adapted rapidly to battlefield developments and emerging threats in terms of the employment of its capabilities. The VKS did suffer from the same tendency when it came to targeting, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of fires without prioritisation is a tendency that should be carefully monitored, except in instances where a battery is directly allocated to a unit, has organic capabilities for target acquisition or is operating under higher command. If the Russians can resolve the cultural tendency to treat all instructions as valid until directly countermanded, and all intelligence as accurate unless contradicted, their capability may rapidly improve, coming closer to what their systems suggest they should be able to execute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-russian-military-is-culturally-vulnerable-to-deception&quot;&gt;The Russian Military is Culturally Vulnerable to Deception&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of too few experienced tactical commanders and a culture that leans into courses of action without distributing sufficient situational awareness for contextual judgement leads to a force that is systemically vulnerable to deception measures. It is vulnerable to deception for three reasons. First, the tendency to treat information received as true unless there is contradictory information leads to systemic confirmation bias. Second, the force does not encourage honest reporting of failures, while there is a shortage of capabilities for battle damage assessment. Third, Russian systems are largely designed around single missions. Even within an EW or air-defence system, each operator will control a different sensor or function. Operators are trained to examine the specific picture for which they are responsible. Neither in their systems’ design, nor in their culture, is there an effective fusion process. In consequence, although the force often has the information to spot inconsistencies in its sensor picture, it is rarely able to compare its datasets to identify these inconsistencies within an operationally relevant timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deception has succeeded against Russian forces at all echelons and across all three service branches. At the tactical level, the UAF have systematically employed false signals traffic and decoys of prestige systems to misdirect Russian fires. This has almost always succeeded, leading to a vast expenditure of munitions against non-existent targets and a corresponding vulnerability for Russian fires in revealing their positions. Tracking how the Russians were conducting battle damage assessment and thereby assuring the Russian military that all strikes were successful repeatedly led to the loss of Russian aircraft and other capabilities because they proceeded on the assumption that the threat had been eliminated. At the operational level, too, Russian forces have been predictable in allocating resources against telegraphed movements and failing to detect or prepare for concealed movements. This has even taken place when some Russian reporting streams have detected concentrations but have been unable to present a sufficiently convincing case to commanders to win resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability of the Russian forces to deception is also a risk for its adversaries. Especially prior to a conflict, the primary aim of a force is often deterrence or shaping. In much NATO discussion of these issues subtle changes in force posture, weapons fits on aircraft, patterns of behaviour and so on are used to try to message varying levels of readiness, preparedness and will. Many of these actions are premised on the assumption that they will be observed by the adversary. From a technical point of view, it is certainly true that the Russians can see these kinds of activities. However, when Ukrainian forces struck the cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea with Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles on 13 April 2022 there was no indication that its radar was operating. This was supposed to be the central ISTAR node for the air defence of the Black Sea Fleet, yet despite being in an active warzone, the ship’s primary sensors were not on. Nor was this an isolated incident. Russian aviation, shot down over Ukraine, has been found on more than one occasion to have its radar in the stowed position, with safety covers over primary sensors. These incidents speak to complacency, poor ground crew training and a lack of mission focus. When considering the issues of process and lack of fusion described above, however, the visibility of these subtle adjustments for Russian operational commanders is at best inconsistent and at worst non-existent. From a deterrence point of view – or for the purposes of shaping decision-making – this is concerning because it suggests that most of the nuance in messaging may be lost. Therefore, while the Russian forces may be vulnerable to deception, the message must be clearly telegraphed. In the context of deterrence, one of the biggest challenges may be preventing the Russians from deceiving themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In assessing whether the Russians are closing the gap between their potential and actual capabilities, it is important to pay close attention to their discipline in the employment of sensors, the level of fusion achieved between sensors and whether the situational awareness that is needed to provide officers context for information is properly disseminated. If these issues are addressed, there could be a rapid improvement in the performance of the Russian armed forces. Left unaddressed, the Russians, having the potential capabilities but not the necessary awareness, may fight by lashing out at sounds and in response to blows. One can readily trick such an adversary into striking in the wrong direction. But that does not stop it from being a dangerous adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-forces-are-prone-to-fratricide&quot;&gt;Russian Forces Are Prone to Fratricide&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fratricide has been a widespread problem for the Russian forces during their invasion of Ukraine. This has been across all systems. Russian air defences have regularly engaged friendly aircraft. When Russian troops deviate from their assigned axes or the timing of their actions becomes desynchronised, they are often bracketed by their own artillery. Russian units in complex terrain have also become embroiled in exchanges of fire between one another’s positions. This speaks to a lack of C2 and control measures during operations. It likely reflects Russian troops largely conducting scripted exercises rather than free-play force-on-force activity where they are used to dealing with the ambiguities that arise on the battlefield. Some Russian units are much better at this. Among line units, however, map-reading and other basic soldiering skills are not well understood, leading to disorientation and therefore a propensity to misidentify sources of fire. Artillery strikes on friendlies have arisen either because units have been detected retreating or redeploying by UAV and presumed hostile based on their direction of travel, or because pre-planned strikes have caught units that have moved slower or faster than dictated by planning. Here, a lack of IFF (identification, friend or foe) procedures is notable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the sub-tactical errors described above, fratricide is a systemic issue between Russian systems. For example, the Khibiny EW pod, mounted to a number of Russian aircraft, automatically detects radars and disrupts them. Unfortunately for the Russians, it tends to also do this to other Russian aircraft. Pairs of Russian strike aircraft mounting this system have therefore had to choose between having a functional radar or EW protection. They have often been ordered to prioritise their radar. This wider issue of confliction between systems, or lack of compatibility between communications equipment, could be managed if units had good situational awareness and a high level of training and reversionary planning in the deconfliction by time or space of their different EW effects. In practice, it leads to a great deal of confusion and mutual disruption. It also offers innumerable – albeit regularly shifting – seams through which effects can breach Russian defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further fratricidal issue is the culture of reporting within the Russian military. Those who fail are usually replaced or threatened with punishment. Alternatively, for senior officers, failure can lead to a different organisation being given leadership for a specified task. Far from incentivising success, this often leads to dishonest reporting in which the blame for failure is transferred onto others. This scapegoating of colleagues – endemic in the Russian special services but also in the military – obscures the actual operational problems that must be solved. These only become apparent when they can no longer be concealed, slowing the learning of lessons, but also leading to predictable and predicted vulnerabilities not being addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of fratricide therefore may be studied in three respects as a measure of progress in the development of the Russian Armed Forces. First, there must be an assessment as to the level of effort in future Russian systems to deconflict their effects. Second, there is the question of free-play exercises and testing deconfliction in a dynamic environment to build the necessary skills to avoid fratricide. Third, there is the cultural issue of an honest reporting culture. Without incentives to resolve these issues, it is likely that the Russian military will continue to employ effects that cause its troops harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final point on fratricide is the attitude of the Russian military generally, and of its officer corps in particular, to people – its own and civilians. The widespread war crimes by Russian troops throughout the conflict have been widely documented. But it should also be noted that many Russian officers do not invest time in looking after their personnel or caring for their welfare. The culture of hazing in the Russian military arguably creates strong disincentives for junior officers to become involved in the everyday lives of their subordinates. This stems from a general cultural approach that does not place a great deal of value on human life. For senior Russian officers who spent their time as junior officers in the Soviet Union there is still a mindset of seeing people as an inexhaustible resource to be expended. But that is not Russia today. Russia has a finite number of available military personnel. This culture of not valuing individuals is a form of institutional fratricide. Although it leads Russian troops to take a great deal of punishment without surrendering on the battlefield – there is an expectation and acceptance of suffering – it also leads to low morale, poor unit cohesion and troops who lack the team spirit to effectively conduct sub-tactical manoeuvre. Given Russia’s ageing population and its limited base for recruits, progress in its approach to its human capital is another important metric for assessing whether the Russian armed forces can improve their capabilities after this conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-lessons-identified-for-the-british-military&quot;&gt;V. Lessons Identified for the British Military&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian military – as outlined in the second chapter of this report – differed considerably in its size, capabilities, structure and culture compared with NATO forces. There are some threats that proved exceedingly difficult for the UAF that would not pose a threat to NATO armies. For example, NATO would not face the same technological disadvantages in the air against Russian aircraft or be unable to contest Russia’s distant blockade. Conversely, there are areas where the UAF are considerably more capable than the forces of many NATO states. Another feature of identifying lessons for future conflict is that some of the weaknesses identified in the previous chapter as regards Russia’s armed forces may be resolved following this conflict. This chapter, therefore, focuses on those aspects that are considered likely constants and applicable to a range of adversaries. This chapter is also specifically aimed at identifying relevant lessons for the British military in relation to how it is currently projected to develop until 2030, although many of the observations have application across NATO members. For other armies, slightly different lessons may apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;there-is-no-sanctuary&quot;&gt;There Is No Sanctuary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first clear lesson from the war in Ukraine is that the enemy can conduct strikes on targets throughout its adversary’s operational depth with long-range precision fires. Moreover, in target states, the Russians have proven able to retain networks of agents in place to observe key targets and to update their command on the movement of troops and stores. The integration of human intelligence (HUMINT) into Russian long-range precision-fires kill chains is critical. Given that Ukraine has also retained this capability, despite the exigencies of the counterintelligence regime on the occupied territories, it seems unlikely that states can plan on the assumption that they can conceal key sites, or the movement of materiel, from the enemy. The Russians have missed targets because of self-imposed frictions in their kill chains, usually striking too late rather than not at all. Their misses have not been for want of intelligence. The effect of these munitions on targets when they strike them is sufficient to destroy most military objects other than deep subterranean or heavily hardened structures. Non-hardened structures are also targetable by loitering munitions, whose accuracy and affordability make them a persistent and pervasive threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UAF, it was found that the ability to conduct dispersed operations was critical to survivability. Without this capability – to disperse and maintain aircraft in the field for a limited period, while periodically returning to main bases when repairs allowed – it is likely that the Ukrainian Air Force would not have survived the opening days of the conflict. Furthermore, dependence on single critical pieces of infrastructure for C2 is not only risky if they are struck, but also risks encouraging escalatory behaviour by the adversary. For the RAF it appears that a critical question for its survivability is the number of deployable maintenance kits available for its aircraft and the capacity to use secondary and tertiary airfields to disrupt enemy planning. This challenge is especially important in future concepts as aircraft become more dependent on software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian Ground Forces similarly found that long-range precision strikes were used against their stockpiles, against training establishments and against maintenance facilities when these were identified. Maintenance facilities had to be situated a long way from the front and dispersed, not because distance assured protection, but because increasing the space over which the enemy had to search for them improved survivability. Ukrainian war stocks survived because they could be rapidly displaced and dispersed. Russian materiel has remained highly vulnerable to long-range fires. The reduction in the logistical tail and therefore reduced vulnerability of precision systems is perhaps as important as their effect in terms of their superiority to non-precision fires. The historical approach of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps and 3 UK Division of erecting tented cities – command posts with a large physical footprint – is non-viable in wartime on the modern battlefield. These sites will be identified and struck. Moreover, as the Russians have found to their detriment, concentrated command posts inside requisitioned civilian buildings are similarly vulnerable to long-range precision fires unless all staff retain rigid communications discipline. Even here, the HUMINT threat means that locations should be moved frequently and key components of a staff dispersed. The capacity to access staff work remotely means that it is not strictly necessary to concentrate all headquarters components in close physical proximity to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of pervasive strike capabilities are different for the Royal Navy because naval operations are in continual motion and therefore do not suffer from the same vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the war in Ukraine has seen a vast expenditure of anti-ship munitions fired from the air, sea and land. These have mainly been fired against ground targets and in this role have had reduced accuracy. Technical examination of these munitions – and how and why they struck the wrong ground targets – demonstrates that they would be highly effective at sea, however. The volume of long-range anti-ship missiles the Russians can bring to bear means the fleet must not set patterns and work strenuously to break the targeting kill chain. Conceptually, the true problem for the Royal Navy lies in multi-domain concepts. In a constrained sea, in close proximity to the shore, or in sea space canalised by mines, the vulnerability to such fires increases exponentially. While sea power can deliver significant if non-decisive effects on an adversary from afar, if it is to affect the fight in other domains it must come closer. Much UK Commando Force thinking about ship-to-shore manoeuvre for raiding currently emphasises the exploitation of clutter in the littoral environment and the noise of civilian shipping. Ukraine demonstrates that once mines are in play during a major conflict, this clutter rapidly evaporates. Arguably a major conceptual gap has emerged in UK military thinking between the Royal Navy, with blue-water capabilities, and the rest of the force, with its emphasis on multi-domain integration. The conflict in Ukraine demonstrates that this is a conceptual gap to which the UK joint force needs an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the Russian missile systems are reliable and accurate. Cruise missiles can be intercepted, but the Russians routinely adapted flight routes for every mission and such missiles were observed to make up to 80 changes of course on their way to a target. It is not economical for any state to maintain coverage across the requisite frontage to be able to defend all targets with a sufficient density of air defences to guarantee defence against these systems. Russian ballistic missiles meanwhile – notably Iskander 9M723 – fly in a quasi-ballistic trajectory, launch six decoys that significantly alter their radar cross section and targetability, and retain a directional link to satellite-based navigation during the terminal phase, in addition to multiple redundant layers of navigation, that mean it is highly uneconomical to deploy interceptors to defeat these threats against all possible targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of attention given to Russia’s depleted stocks as regards these capabilities, given the rate of expenditure in Ukraine. This is an issue. Moreover, Russia cannot rapidly produce these missiles. It is estimated that it can fabricate around 100 Kalibr missiles per year, for example, and this may come at the expense of other munitions because many Russian munitions have common key modules that act as bottlenecks in the production of multiple systems. For Iskander 9M723, the Russians have been able to maintain a production line of six per month during the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, given that this arsenal has proven effective during the war, it can be assumed that its replenishment will be a priority for the Russian military. With China and Iran both relying heavily on similar complexes, and the proliferation of knowledge on how to achieve precision with these weapons, it must also be assumed that a convergence in systems design between these states will create economies of scale. Ironically the loss of military equipment may also encourage the Russian military to consolidate around fewer platforms, further increasing the capacity to prioritise resources. This lesson from the conflict regarding the threat that British forces must prepare for is pertinent to both the future as regards Russia and adversaries in other theatres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;warfighting-demands-significant-slack-capacity&quot;&gt;Warfighting Demands Significant Slack Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The professionalism of the British military and the competence of units is high. Ukrainian troops have found British training invaluable. British weapons have also proven highly effective on the battlefield. High morale, skilled soldiering and significant corporate experience are of limited value in high-intensity warfare without ammunition, however. It is abundantly clear that the British military is woefully deficient in its stockpiles across domains. At the height of the fighting in Donbas, Russia was using more ammunition in two days than the entire British military has in stock. At Ukrainian rates of consumption, British stockpiles would potentially last a week. Of course, given that the UAF fielded more than 10 times as many operational artillery pieces as the British Army at the beginning of the conflict, it might take more than a week for the British Army to expend all its available ammunition. All this demonstrates, however, is that the British Army lacks the firepower to deliver the kind of blunting effect that the UAF achieved north of Kyiv. The oft-cited refrain of the UK Ministry of Defence that these deficiencies are not a problem because the UK fights alongside NATO allies would be more credible if the situation were much better among any of the UK’s European allies. It is not, except in Finland. Nor – as Ukrainian troops discovered to their surprise – are ammunition, charge bags and other essential consumables consistent between NATO artillery systems; there is an inadequate capacity to draw on one another’s stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deficiencies are not limited to tube artillery. Air defence – whether air- or sea-launched, or ground-based – is similarly entirely inadequate. Ukraine has practical experience using British MANPADS. They are highly effective. Although Ukraine lacks experience with Sky Sabre, Sea Viper, Meteor or Aster missiles, the effectiveness of these systems has been widely demonstrated. Nevertheless, a cursory study of procurement data and, for the land environment, an examination of the units available for air defence, shows that there is insufficient depth of munitions for any of these systems to be credible in high-intensity conflict. The survivability of Ukrainian units has demanded organic MANPADS to be available at all echelons and across all arms. Even with 60 dedicated Air Defence divisions, Ukraine has struggled to provide air defence to its manoeuvre forces, its critical national infrastructure and population centres. It has had to prioritise between them. It is worth briefly noting that there is a point at which munitions become overly complex, expensive and slow to produce so that the value of their increased performance comes with diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s survival initially depended on its own large stockpiles of Soviet-calibre munitions. Now, Ukraine is almost entirely dependent on NATO supplies. It is evident, however, that manufacturing capacity in many NATO states cannot meet the needs of its members in the event of a major conflict. Establishing production lines and assuring access to key materials such as explosive energetics takes time. Beyond merely holding sufficient stockpiles and spares, therefore, it is also abundantly clear that NATO countries – including the UK – must work out a value-for-money proposition that allows defence industry to maintain slack capacity to be ramped up in the event of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where the British Army at present appears particularly strong is in its maintaining large training establishments disproportionate to the size of the force. The British Army maintains dedicated training schools for many of its military specialisms, which all require permanent staff and instructors. As demonstrated by the large-scale training to Ukrainian troops – carried out in parallel to the ongoing training of British forces – there is considerable slack capacity in this system. While this is a disproportionate cost on a small army in peacetime, its importance during any major conflict should not be underappreciated. Even assuming that British forces remain highly survivable, the rate of injury combined with the very small overall size of the British armed forces must see troop levels in frontline units decline in any major war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK must therefore be able to train a second echelon. Ukraine mobilised its instructors from training establishments early in the conflict and this has contributed to difficulties in training additional forces. Russia has suffered even more from this problem because it delivers a significant proportion of training in-unit, which is not possible for units that are deployed. The British Army, therefore, must not squander its resilience in training capacity for the sake of efficiencies in the short term. Given that the RAF and Royal Navy have pushed their training establishments towards externally contracted solutions, the scalability and adaptability of these structures in wartime should be critically examined. The air war over Ukraine has demonstrated a rapid action–reaction cycle between offence and defence that has required significant adaptation of tactics and methods. For the Royal Navy and the RAF it is vital that simulators and externally contracted training solutions enable rapid adaptation of tactics and parameters in conflict, lest trainees become forced to learn obsolete tactics as a result of the training tools available rather than operational requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where slack capacity is invaluable is logistics and maintenance. As explained earlier, the UAF suffered from a high rate of turnover of key specialists during peacetime. This, however, proved invaluable in war. The British military currently lacks logistical capacity for its existing forces, let alone in a situation where more forces would need to be mobilised, or where the UK was seeking to sustain a multinational formation over which it had command. The critical point is less whether logistics units can be retained in the force, but rather whether better recruitment of logistics personnel in which they receive training that certifies them for civilian work can create a depth of reserves with associated liability to underpin the sustainment of both the existing force and additional mobilised units in wartime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to appropriately establish which platforms, whether because of their ubiquitous utility, or the inherent vulnerability of their tasks, demand mass. Some, such as pontoon bridging, mortars and UAS must be available at scale. A large number of troops are required to know how to use these tools. While there are minimum characteristics of such devices for them to perform their assigned task, the rate of consumption of these capabilities demands that they are ruthlessly simplified and rationalised so that they can be produced at scale and cheaply. Identifying where such consumables demand complexity and striving for standardisation of complex components, even if other elements of a system may have variations, is vital for achieving sufficient economies of scale. Again, there is a challenge for industry because this demands a great deal of work up front on design, but a very narrow margin of return on each manufactured object. Developing an appropriate value-for-money framework to have industrial capacity in such areas is similarly critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uas-and-cuas-must-be-available-across-all-branches-and-echelons&quot;&gt;UAS and CUAS Must Be Available Across All Branches and Echelons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key lesson from the war is that UAS and CUAS must be available at all branches of the force. It is also evident that the UK and other NATO members have made mistakes in how they categorise UAS, generate the capability in the force and have governance for their employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because NATO forces were early adopters of UAS, they have inherited the legacy of earlier generations of system. Early UAS were expensive, complex and often difficult to fly. Thus, specific units were established to be trained to use UAS and considerable investment was put into making the platforms better. Furthermore, because NATO forces have used UAS in an environment where even small numbers of casualties were politically significant, the emphasis has been skewed towards force protection. Since UAS were flying objects, they should be managed as such. In the UK this places permission for launching UAS under the responsibility of the Military Aviation Authority. On NATO exercises careful attention is paid to airspace deconfliction, so that helicopters and UAS, for example, do not find themselves in the same airspace and at risk of collision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the evolution of the system of governance for UAS has proceeded logically and the structures around their use made sense when they were formulated, they have produced forces poorly suited for the operating environment, as observed in Ukraine and elsewhere. For pilots and other elements of the force, the expectation that UAS can be excluded from airspace is not viable. There will be many enemy UAS in the airspace. Training to manage this flight risk, therefore, is critical; training in an airspace without this hazard simply transfers risk from training to operations. In any case, given the need for troops to manage their electromagnetic signature and the impact of jamming, tactical echelons cannot guarantee getting information about their flight plans back to higher headquarters. Nevertheless, they will need eyes in the sky to retain situational awareness and to remain competitive. Requiring higher-echelon approval will make the employment of UAS uncompetitively slow. Requiring units to follow the procedures for aircraft in launching UAS also means that it is inordinately expensive to train UAS operators and this too becomes a constraint on their employment that means tactical units will not have enough pilots to keep up the required number of orbits to be competitive. For the UK, the implication is that UAS need to be classified as munitions rather than aircraft. At present, there are fewer administrative restrictions for the Royal Artillery to fire live 155-mm howitzer munitions over civilian roads than for them to fly a UAS over the same airspace to monitor what they are hitting. This must be changed, and it requires changes to policy, rather than simply expecting units to make the administrative burden of employing UAS manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS should be split into three broad categories for land forces. The first are rotary-type UAS able to manoeuvre close to the ground and in complex terrain, fielded across all manoeuvre formations for the purposes of route proving, reconnaissance, situational awareness, target acquisition, fire correction, and a wide range of other tasks. The second are fixed-wing UAS able to fly at medium altitude into operational depth and perform a single task, whether that be target acquisition or direct effects. Where multiple effects are required, this can be achieved by flying complexes of multiple UAS of this type. These should be used by units able to affect what they find, either reconnaissance units or artillery. Both the first and second category of UAS must be cheap and available in quantity. The third category comprises platforms carrying higher-echelon sensors. In Ukraine, this includes the TB-2, which was most useful as a maritime patrol platform. Platforms such as Watchkeeper and Protector fall into this category, best employed behind the FLOT and tasked with standoff sensing. It must be understood that employing these scarce assets depends on shaping, or else they will be rapidly attrited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS were also found to be highly useful for air and naval forces in Ukraine. The ability to put sensors aloft for a protracted period without the need for a wrap to recover pilots or the burden of life support on the platform greatly extended the range at which maritime patrolling could be conducted and the risks that could be taken to gain situational awareness. The lack of loitering munitions able to target air-defence radars has been noted as a critical deficiency in the UAF that would have enabled much more aggressive air operations. Flying at around 50–100 ft and using terrain, Ukrainian pilots have been able to get within around 15–30 km of targets. Although Western aircraft are much more capable, Russian surface-to-air missile (SAM) complexes remain highly lethal and would likely drive aircraft low. The Ukrainian Air Force found that the suppressive effect of HARMs (high-speed anti-radiation missiles) launched against Russian radar was short. Loitering munitions, by contrast, can remain in place and thereby create multiple dilemmas for SAM operators that could significantly increase the window within which aircraft could penetrate the Russian missile-engagement zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering UAS has proven no less important across all domains. For land forces, tactical sub-units must first have a means of detecting the presence of hostile UAS. Frontages must be covered by the means of defeating enemy UAS. Defeating UAS does not mean kinetically destroying them. It simply means denying the UAS the ability to achieve its mission. This could be done through the dazzling of sensors, or denial of navigation or control. The most efficient protection against UAS is EW and ensuring that electronic attack and electronic protection is available at all echelons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the British Army has under-resourced this capability. Having two EW signal regiments and assigning their capability to operational tasks leaves most of the force unprotected. It is also important to note that electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) fratricide and C2 are both major challenges of widespread EW employment. The UAF have suffered from battalion staffs who are not sufficiently familiar with EW capabilities to synchronise and manage these tools. The Russian military has suffered even more from this problem. The availability of these troops on exercise and an understanding across units as to how to work with their EW support is vital, especially to avoid EW personnel knocking down friendly UAS, or UAS being launched when the EMS has not been shaped to enable their employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, nevertheless, a need for kinetic defeat of some kinds of UAS, especially those penetrating operational depth to conduct target acquisition or loitering munitions. It is highly inefficient to have dedicated CUAS batteries in addition to air-defence batteries. Nevertheless, the munitions that air and missile defence batteries employ do not make CUAS missions economical. The answer must be the provision of intermediate munitions that can draw on the common air picture and guidance available to air-defence units but without the cost associated with munitions that must catch and defeat more complex targets. Point defence for critical sites is also an enduring requirement given the ability for long-range UAS to fly below the radar horizon on complex pre-programmed routes and thereby reach static targets in operational depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the RAF, the issue of CUAS is foremost one of integration. Given that loitering munitions targeting airfields, critical national infrastructure and other targets are exceedingly small and low flying, elevated sensors such as the AESA radar of the F-35 are ideal for detecting these targets. At the same time, the allocation of F-35s against such targets would be an entirely inappropriate use of the platform. The RAF therefore should either ensure that it has an economical means of supplying wide-area surveillance for tracking these threats or that it can offboard track data from combat air patrols to ground CUAS systems. Given that CUAS systems are often short ranged, these would not usually be priority recipients of such data, but ensuring access to that data will be important if the RAF wishes to avoid having assets drawn to suboptimal taskings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy also faces a CUAS challenge. UAS can be used on maritime patrolling to locate and monitor task forces in a more efficient manner than aircraft, while they are also less economical to engage. Conceptually this is not a novel threat. Of much greater concern is that as the Royal Navy seeks to project power into littoral environments, targets such as ship-to-shore connectors, fast attack boats and other vessels lacking air defence become highly vulnerable to armed UAVs. If the threat from anti-ship cruise missiles drives the main task force out to sea, the ability to operate in the littoral demands that fast attack craft have a means of detecting and countering UAS. The UAF have had considerable success against Russian fast attack craft with TB2. As countries such as Iran increase their investment in strike-capable UAVs, the ability for fast craft to operate within this threat is important beyond contests with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fighting-for-the-right-to-precision&quot;&gt;Fighting for the Right to Precision&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated in the discussion of UAS above, the experience in Ukraine clarifies some of the critical effects of a contested EMS. Military discourse has – for several years – focused on the problem of EMS denial. Its denial was a major challenge for the UAF in 2014 and 2015. Measures were taken to make the force more resilient. The 2022 invasion therefore provides a better canvas to assess the impact of EW on militaries with appropriately resilient systems, and tactics, techniques and procedures. The effect is not EMS denial. Limitations of power, the tactical necessity to manage signatures and the consequences of EMS fratricide all mean that even forces with large EW capabilities cannot achieve blanket denial across large geographic areas for a sustained period. Denial can be achieved for a short period, or across a limited geographic area. Targeted denial can be delivered for a sustained period over a wide area. However, any kind of targeted denial of bands of the EMS can be evaded through altering frequencies or bearers. The result is that EMS interference and disruption is continual, but denial is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that contesting the EMS is less of a priority. Left uncontested, EW slows kill chains, increases confusion and, perhaps most importantly, degrades precision. The inability to determine accurate locations, let alone transmit timely data on target locations, or for munitions to achieve precise impacts against targets, all risk a force losing competitiveness against an opponent. Precision munitions not only inflict disproportionately more damage to the enemy but significantly reduce friendly vulnerabilities in the rear by shrinking the logistics footprint. Precision depends on a functioning kill chain, however. To assure that kill chain and to ensure that the munitions function properly, it is essential to actively contest the EMS. The layering of EW and kinetic attacks is vital to ensure that limited stocks of high-end weapons deliver the effects required. For example, an attempt to deliver precision effects against a target can be disrupted through interference with navigation frequencies so that precise target acquisition is denied. Here, the use of an EW baseline to identify the location of the source of this interference can enable non-precision fires to force the EW platform to displace, thereby opening a window in which the coordinates for an accurate precision strike can be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, Ukraine distributed EW capabilities across its groups of forces to provide organic support on key axes. It was rapidly discovered that there was insufficient training in units to properly employ these troops. For that reason, the UAF have formed a Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities Command, enabling end-to-end management of capability development, electronic-payload preparation and delivery, as well as force protection and direction finding. Although a more centralised approach to the allocation of EW assets has been adopted, it remains necessary to have these capabilities available on all active fronts. The three basic tasks of EW troops are reconnaissance (direction finding), protection and electronic attack. It is necessary for EW troops to understand the fires plan and scheme of manoeuvre, and to have access to the synchronisation matrix of other arms in a force so that they can distribute capabilities to optimally support the other branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of contesting the EMS is pattern recognition in enemy cyber and electromagnetic activities, and the provision of advice on where there are seams in the enemy system that can be exploited. For example, wide-area jamming of navigational systems likely means that the enemy is not postured to conduct accurate fire missions. The lifting of this may indicate that UAS are about to be launched or that a fire mission is about to commence from a sector. However, this also means that friendly UAS committed to that sector can – for a time – accurately determine the location of the targets such as batteries that are fixed by virtue of their preparing to fire. Similarly, if enemy EW protection is strong, targeting the sources of emission will cause EW platforms to displace, revealing gaps in protection that can be exploited to deliver effects. All these effects, however, are limited in duration and require the necessary capabilities to all be available so that the window of opportunity can be exploited once it is identified. Understanding that EW may drive, as well as be a tool applied by, planning is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the British military EW is primarily available from the air and at sea, with limited numbers of specialists available for ground forces. Although Russian capabilities are quite effective in dividing air and ground components, with their air defences also drawing air forces into mission sets that will struggle to complement ground force activity, it is reasonable to assume that the British military could plan on using air assets for electronic attack. Naval EW support is harder to envisage because of the distance at which navies must operate from the land to remain survivable. Air-based electronic attack does not offer electronic protection, however. It is evident that there is a need for EW defence to be widely available for all manoeuvre elements. This includes deception. The British Army has had success in exercises through the emplacement of false command posts and other EW decoys. Russian and Ukrainian forces have also successfully employed these techniques. While units might be able to organically use such measures to improve their survivability, deception in the EMS also offers a valuable means of drawing out and then striking enemy prestige systems, especially those capable of delivering precision fires. Lining up the assets to take advantage of such a lure necessitates drawing on kinetic capabilities and their synchronisation of availability with EW capabilities. There is thus a need for planners – often at quite a junior level – to understand this game of cat and mouse and to be able to assign personnel to enable it. Attriting enemy precision capabilities or EW assets is critical in fighting for the right to precision. Whichever side can secure better access to the EMS is likely to retain significant tactical advantages that accumulate over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity contesting the EMS requires regular emissions. Operations also create significant EMS signatures even among disciplined forces. A force that sees the EMS as something to be feared, with its sole aim being the limitation of its signature, is likely to introduce so much friction into its operations that it cedes initiative and advantage to the enemy through self-imposed constraints. Avoiding this means that a force exposes itself to greater risk of targeting. Mitigating that risk requires an understanding of the force’s own signature across the force – not just among the specialist EW community – and comfort on planning actions that prevent the enemy’s detections creating timely and reliable information for targeting. Understanding the EMS is also important because in an active contest, EW troops cannot guarantee sustained protection. The enemy may successfully bring about windows of opportunity where it has an advantage in the EMS and can therefore bring precision effects to bear. Understanding the indicators for these conditions among manoeuvre force commanders is important if they are to take the appropriate countermeasures to ensure the survivability of their forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the importance of EW to air and maritime operations is significant, the war in Ukraine offers limited lessons for the RAF and Royal Navy in this context because Ukraine’s air and naval capabilities are too technologically inferior to Russia’s to provide a comparable problem set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;disperse-dig-deep-or-move-fast&quot;&gt;Disperse, Dig Deep or Move Fast&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of dispersion has been at the forefront of British Army discussion since 2015. In general, the importance of dispersion was vindicated by the data from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian infantry companies tend to disperse across a 3-km frontage. Greater concentration often decreases the survivability of units because it begins to make the use of precision munitions and the allocation of ISTAR assets economical in terms of the effect delivered per munition. One important consequence of dispersion is that it increases the tactical commander’s span of control. When combined with the multiple enablers necessary for a formation to be competitive, it is evident that a battalion commander in this conflict is often dealing with a comparable frontage to that traditionally occupied by a brigade, with similar effects in terms of their ability to maintain a physical presence among their troops. Since battalion staffs are not staffed like brigades – and would not be survivable if they were – there is considerable strain placed on company and battalion commanders. The British Army, which tends to put senior personnel within their rank into command positions, is in a reasonable position to handle this challenge. Nevertheless, developing C2 tools to allow beyond-line-of-sight C2 in sub-units is critical. Another challenge for dispersed forces, especially if they must echelon through one another, is identifying friend from foe. Ukrainian troops have tended to sacrifice camouflage for clear identification (using coloured bands) for their manoeuvre forces, relying on speed rather than concealment for survivability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although dispersion has proven critical to survivability against indirect fire, it also risks individual positions becoming isolated against enemy forces if they choose to concentrate. In concentrating, the enemy likely accepts higher rates of attrition, but that does not necessarily prevent ground from being taken. On both the attack and defence, the UAF have found that localised actions using reserves are critical to the reinforcement of sectors under pressure and thus to ground holding or building momentum. This ability for dispersed elements to echelon through one another to rapidly flank and defeat enemy concentrations has also been important in offensive operations. To do this, however, requires that the force concentrates, as survivability is afforded principally by mobility. If the period of concentration is sufficiently short and the target sufficiently mobile, it is difficult for the enemy to bring effective fires to bear on the right location. If these actions coincide with EW and other effects that extend the enemy’s kill chain, the window of opportunity for concentration at the appropriate point can be extended. Troops must remain mobile if under observation or they will come under highly effective fire. Even Ukrainian Special Operations Forces found that if they went static having penetrated the enemy, they risked being detected by UAS traversing the battlespace to the front and engaged with indirect fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of speed as the best means of protection is also evident in the employment of air-assault operations. Russia successfully penetrated deep inside Ukraine’s air defences precisely because it was able to open a window of opportunity in which the speed of insertion was critical. Ultimately Russia inserted too few personnel too deep for them to be reinforced. Ukraine has also employed aviation assault to cut ground lines of communication ahead of an advance. This too had to be done rapidly, exploiting gaps in enemy air defences. The prospect of pattern setting through second waves or resupply to these troops, however, is bleak, risking ambush for aviation en route or being caught on the ground by artillery. The feasible depth for such operations therefore is very limited. If under observation from UAS, troops ultimately have two options: having defeated the UAS they must either displace or move into hardened cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for hardened cover has been demonstrated throughout this conflict. Shell scrapes and other hasty procedures may improve the survivability of a unit against the opening salvo, but this salvo also risks fixing the unit in cover that is insufficiently protected. Once fixed, the enemy can transition to airburst or thermobaric munitions and thereby kill the target in place. In essence, troops should avoid making administrative stops in the indirect fire zone. If these are essential, shell scrapes may be justified. Mobility is the preferred means of improving survivability in this context. However, if troops are to remain in a position for any length of time, positions must be hardened and have overhead protection. Urban settlements, which often have cellars and other subterranean infrastructure, are optimal defensive points because these positions can be reinforced but begin as a sound basis for shelters. In the open, defensive positions should be dug underground. Both thermal sheeting and overhead cover are very important. Trenches in open ground are too easily targeted so they should be dug along treelines and other areas where there is overhead cover, thereby obscuring where in a trench there are entrances to hardened positions. Hardening positions – including entrances to trench structures – also requires the establishment of UAS detection and laser detection with countermeasures, such as smoke grenades. For any force required to hold vital ground, which is therefore restricted in its ability to displace and manoeuvre, excavation equipment should be available to rapidly emplace hardened defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is far from over. Although the Russian military is now on the defensive and withdrawing in multiple directions, there is not yet an indication that its hostile intent against Ukraine nor its efforts to undermine the West economically and politically have subsided. Although the massive sacrifices of the UAF have inflicted serious and widespread damage to the Russian capacity for offensive operations, Ukraine’s international partners need to fully appreciate the scale of the conflict, the adversary’s capabilities and the cause of their deficiencies to assess whether the Russians are effectively adapting when they try to recover from their recent setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has aimed to properly frame events in Ukraine by outlining Ukrainian decision-making, capabilities and intent, to clarify the scale of operations, and to distinguish between the consequences of Russia’s deficient planning and mistaken decisions compared with the structural and systemic weaknesses of its forces. The shortcomings of this report are that it does not deal in detail with Ukrainian losses nor does it assess the relative effectiveness of Ukraine’s tactics and performance. It also does not cover the second part of the conflict. For reasons of operational security, these issues will need to be discussed at a suitable point in the future. However, the authors have ensured that what is set out in this report’s conclusions is not contradicted by non-public data. It is hoped that this report has therefore provided a sound basis from which to identify critical lessons from the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than offer a summary of the many detailed and specific observations made in this report, it is worth instead summarising three critical points that policymakers should draw from the conflict if they are to ensure that their national security is built on sound foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the war in Ukraine has demonstrated that consumption rates in high-intensity warfighting remain extraordinarily high and that resilience demands a capacity to build new units, produce spare parts and ammunition, and have sufficient stockpiles to remain competitive in the opening phases of fighting. At present, it is evident that NATO members other than the US are not in a strong position on these fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the UAF were competitive against their adversaries not because of superior equipment in the early phases of the war but because they were adaptable – especially at the tactical level – and rapidly innovated new capabilities and concepts of employment to address specific areas of vulnerability where the Russians had achieved overmatch. For NATO countries, the critical question therefore is not whether a specific weapons system gives advantage, desirable though this is, but whether a country’s policies, permissions and industrial processes enable the rapid development, experimentation, refinement, acquisition at scale and employment of new systems and tactics. Do personnel at all levels have the permissions to contribute their expertise? Do tactical formations have the capability to procure and test equipment properly? Or is defence procurement a glacial process that is detached from the development of tactics, techniques and procedures? A state in the latter position is unlikely to adapt at the speed of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, there has been abundant debate over whether the war proves the utility or obsolescence of various military systems: loitering munitions versus artillery, or ATGWs versus tanks. These debates are largely nugatory. Legacy systems, from T-64 tanks to BM-21 Grad MLRS have proven instrumental in Ukraine’s survival. That does not mean, however, that historical concepts of employment for these systems remain advisable. The key priority is to understand how new capabilities not only offer opportunity in and of themselves, but also enable and magnify the effects deliverable by legacy systems. Perhaps most important is to appreciate how the correct employment of exquisite capabilities can magnify the impact of cheap and crude equipment. It is evident that to exploit these opportunities, changes to orders of battle, C2 and novel employment may be necessary. The grouping of armour as a reserve, to be committed under propitious circumstances, for example, may make more sense than its distribution into the leading edge of offensive manoeuvre forces. It is also entirely plausible that the synergies between old and new capabilities shift the balance of requirements for the next generation of armoured platforms. But the enduring utility of these tools is not diminished by these changes. In modernising, therefore, forces need to examine how old and new form novel combinations of fighting systems, rather than treating modernisation as a process of deciding what should be procured and what should be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, for all the new capabilities on the battlefield, the war in Ukraine has been marked by the usual miscalculations, uncertainties and human failings. For Ukraine, victory is essential but can only be achieved with the ongoing support of its international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence has made ‘multidomain integration’ (MDI) a conceptual cornerstone of UK military doctrine. In 2020 it released a Joint Concept Note (JCN 1/20) which set out an ambitious vision wherein the full capabilities of each service across all five domains would be able to function ‘as a seamlessly integrated force [that] must also be fused across government and interoperable with principal allies’. JCN 1/20 sets out multiple different areas where seamless integration will apparently be necessary across the joint force and wider government in order to be competitive in future conflicts. However, the same document admits that ‘there is no fixed route to a known MDI destination, so this concept provides a headmark to allow us to explore and develop our MDI ambition’. In other words, the UK currently has a conceptual aim, but no concrete plan for how to transform the force structure and processes that it currently has into ones that can undertake MDI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key contextual factor in the UK’s MDI ambitions is a desire to retain conceptual and technical alignment with the US. Under the banner of Joint All-Domain Operations (JADO), the US military is attempting to transform the way in which it wages war, to better meet the threat posed by an increasingly powerful and assertive People’s Republic of China. Each of the US armed services has ambitious programmes underway to revolutionise the way their assets exchange and use data, to heavily automate command-and-control processes, and to normalise real-time cooperative engagements across the joint force. The UK and other NATO allies are under pressure to follow the US lead at least to some degree, not least due to the need to retain interoperability with US forces as part of a warfighting coalition. While the Pentagon recognises the political importance of retaining operational interoperability with allies, this objective takes second place behind the perceived imperative to radically improve American high-end capabilities against a rising Chinese threat in the Indo-Pacific. Given this, allies such as the UK need to understand the emerging American reforms in detail and plan investment to ensure that crucial integration points across the joint force remain technically and doctrinally compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a widely held quasi-philosophical position across the UK, the US and the armed forces of other nations that future wars will be decided by whichever side can best manage and share data seamlessly across all force elements. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) is doctrinally and conceptually committed to a vision of the future force in which seamless cross-domain connectivity and integration is the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this high-level vision does not translate neatly into programme deliverables and prioritisation decisions. With limited resources and a host of urgent force modernisation and regeneration requirements, the UK’s short-to-medium investments in multidomain integration (MDI)/Joint All-Domain Operations (JADO)-type capabilities will need to be incremental, compared with the huge Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) programme underway in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One potentially useful model for the UK is the US Navy’s Naval Integrated Fire Control – Counter Air (NIFC-CA) programme, which has achieved an unprecedented level of real-time integration between surface warships, airborne assets and weapons in flight by focusing initially on connecting a limited number of core platforms essential to one mission set. To achieve similar results, the MoD will need to carefully prioritise early MDI investment tranches towards seamlessly connecting the assets that will gain the most combat effectiveness from the capability to share real-time situational awareness and conduct joint engagements with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting priority mission sets and using them as an analytical lens offers one way to identify the platforms and force elements where targeted investment in advanced cross-domain data sharing and third-party targeting capabilities would add the most tangible value in an operational context. The vignettes examined in this paper suggest that, in general, focusing on connecting key sensor assets such as F-35, E-7A and special operations forces teams, with long-range precision fires and integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) capabilities such as guided multiple launch rocket systems and Type 45, appears likely to significantly enhance combat effectiveness in challenging scenarios such as suppression of enemy air defence systems/destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) and IAMD, where the current force structure would struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that a necessary aspect of prioritisation is choosing which assets across the joint force do not currently need to be connected by an all-singing, all-dancing data sharing and automated command-and-control solution. Over-ambition coupled with a lack of focus in such a complex and interdependent effort involving all the armed services and Strategic Command is a recipe for programme failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE MINISTRY OF Defence (MoD) has made ‘multidomain integration’ (MDI) a conceptual cornerstone of UK military doctrine. In 2020 it released a Joint Concept Note (JCN 1/20) which set out an ambitious vision wherein the full capabilities of each service across all five domains would be able to function ‘as a seamlessly integrated force [that] must also be fused across government and interoperable with principal allies’. JCN 1/20 sets out multiple different areas where seamless integration will apparently be necessary across the joint force and wider government in order to be competitive in future conflicts. However, the same document admits that ‘there is no fixed route to a known MDI destination, so this concept provides a headmark to allow us to explore and develop our MDI ambition’. In other words, the UK currently has a conceptual aim, but no concrete plan for how to transform the force structure and processesthat it currently has into ones that can undertake MDI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key contextual factor in the UK’s MDI ambitions is a desire to retain conceptual and technical alignment with the US. Under the banner of Joint All-Domain Operations (JADO), the US military is attempting to transform the way in which it wages war, to better meet the threat posed by an increasingly powerful and assertive People’s Republic of China. Each of the US armed services has ambitious programmes underway to revolutionise the way their assets exchange and use data, to heavily automate command-and-control (C2) processes, and to normalise real-time cooperative engagements across the joint force. The UK and other NATO allies are under pressure to follow the US lead at least to some degree, not least due to the need to retain interoperability with US forces as part of a warfighting coalition. While the Pentagon recognises the political importance of retaining operational interoperability with allies, this objective takes second place behind the perceived imperative to radically improve American high-end capabilities against a rising Chinese threat in the Indo-Pacific. Given this, allies such as the UK need to understand the emerging American reforms in detail and plan investment to ensure that crucial integration points across the joint force remain technically and doctrinally compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I of this paper demonstrates the scope of the US Department of Defense (DoD)’s ambitions for creating a fully fledged JADO capacity across the entire joint force, via its new Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) architecture. It briefly explains how the US Army’s Project Convergence, the US Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) and the US Navy’s Naval Integrated Fire Control – Counter Air (NIFC-CA) and Project Overmatch programmes fit into the wider JADC2 effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapters II to IV use vignettes to examine which elements of the UK’s future joint force might benefit most from JADC2-style connectivity across three specific mission sets. The conclusion explores the implied priorities and considerations for the MoD in pursuing its doctrinal aim of MDI through a capacity to conduct JADO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note at the start that the scale and scope of the Chinese military threat in the Indo-Pacific, which is driving JADO ambitions in the US DoD, is of a different nature and magnitude to that faced by European NATO members. This has several important implications for what JADO will mean for the UK and its European NATO partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, unless European NATO members wish to simply purchase JADC2-compliant off-the-shelf platforms, network architectures and weapons systems from the US, they will have to incorporate JADC2 compliance and compatibility into their own existing and future platforms and C2 systems. If they do not, over time they will lose operational interoperability with the US as the latter moves to ever more tightly integrated and automated data sharing, targeting and C2 arrangements to facilitate JADO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, both off-the-shelf procurement of JADC2-compliant equipment and modernisation of hardware, software and communications suites on existing platforms will necessarily take place at a much slower pace in Europe than in the US due to limited funding and other competing priorities. For the UK, regenerating the platforms required to deliver a warfighting division, purchasing sufficient munitions and funding adequate training and exercise activity is already overstressing the budget available – especially in light of the refusal of the government to commit to any increases in Defence spending beyond maintaining 2% of GDP in the Budget Autumn Statement. As such, a comprehensive modernisation programme to make the whole UK Joint Force JADC2 compliant or otherwise capable of JADO-type activities is highly unlikely to be affordable for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Defence in the UK (and in other European NATO member states) has limited programmatic capacity to staff and manage large capital programmes simultaneously. In the UK in autumn 2022 a major increase in the Defence budget was promised by then Prime Minister Liz Truss as a result of the invasion of Ukraine. However, this increase was not confirmed in the Budget statement on 17 November. The Chancellor at the time acknowledged the need for increased defence spending, but deferred a decision until the Integrated Review had been amended in light of the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritisation will, therefore, be critical to enable the UK to make efficient use of initial MDI investment tranches and to avoid decision paralysis in the face of the scale of the challenge. Chapters II, III and IV of this paper provide mission-centric vignettes to explore where the greatest potential combat effectiveness gains might be achieved by early investments to unlock JADO-style capabilities between specific UK platforms. The vignettes comprise: a campaign to suppress enemy air defence systems (SEAD) in Eastern Europe; the provision of IAMD to a forward-deployed UK force in the Middle East; and a contested freedom of navigation operation (FONOP). These were chosen as tasks that UK forces may be called upon to conduct, and also because they span the spectrum of conflict from high-intensity warfighting against a peer nation to potentially contested shows of presence during competition. The vignette approach was chosen to demonstrate that tying MDI/JADO questions to mission-focused output metrics can help policymakers move beyond necessary but broad and convoluted conceptual and doctrine discussions and towards identifying practical investment priorities. In addition to suggesting where significant value might be gained, even concise mission-focused vignettes can also shed light on where investment in cross-domain real-time data sharing is not likely to lead to transformative increases in effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-joint-all-domain-operations&quot;&gt;What are Joint All-Domain Operations?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADO is a conceptual framework which has been created by the US DoD to describe its goal of integrated military operations across the domains of land, air, sea, space and the electromagnetic spectrum. The working US DoD definition of JADO is ‘actions by the joint force in multiple domains integrated in planning and synchronised in execution, at speed and scale needed to gain advantage and accomplish the mission’. The aim is to deliver integrated effects against an opponent across the phases of inter-state cooperation, competition and armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, JADO is not a programme as such, but rather a guiding vision of the sort of operations the US armed forces are to be capable of undertaking in a future conflict. The intent is that by operating in this way, US forces will be able to create multiple simultaneous dilemmas for an enemy which cannot all be solved, and which compel hostile troops and commanders to make difficult or impossible trade-offs. A critical component of this vision is the simplification and acceleration of current decision-making processes, moving from planning cycles measured in days to hours or even minutes. In some respects, this represents a simple desire to speed up the Observe Orient Decide Act loops which govern military decision-making at all levels. This has led some to suggest that there is little to differentiate JADO from earlier operational concepts.10 As a top-down set of guiding principles, JADO is also very similar to the vision laid out by the UK’s own MDI concept note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the US has a practical strategy which the DoD is pursuing to enable – called JADC2. The working definition of JADC2 in the DoD is ‘the warfighting capability to sense, make sense, and act at all levels and phases of war, across all functional areas, domains, and with partners, to deliver information advantage at the speed of relevance’. In more simple terms, JADC2 is a strategy which aims to connect all the sensors across the US Air Force, Navy, Army and Marine Corps into a single and highly automated network. Its primary function is to provide a new kind of joint decision-making and disseminating tool for commanders to enable them to plan, orchestrate and execute JADO. This vision of JADC2 is, to put it mildly, an extremely complex and ambitious undertaking. However, a unified decision-making tool is not the limit of the ambitions for JADC2 across the DoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, JADC2 is also a way to develop a highly automated ‘any-sensor, any-shooter’ network that will process and disseminate data between all the platforms within a joint force, and automatically allocate fire missions and other non-kinetic tasks to the optimal unit or platform at any given time. In this vision, the key output of JADC2 would be a version of a combat cloud or an Internet of Things, which has been described as an application enabled by modern digital communications networks to interface with connected sensors and shooters in a similar fashion to the Uber ride-hailing app. In this vision, a ‘shooter’ does not know or need to know where the target track that they have been automatically allocated was gathered from, and nor would the original source of that target data need to know which ‘shooters’ were available to prosecute the target when they sent the request for fires. Instead, the system would optimise the matching of detected target tracks and weapons solutions automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would represent a major shift from network-centric warfare to data-centric warfare. It requires a C2 system that can be platform-agnostic and capable of taking data from any sensor and supplying firing and targeting solutions to any available effector systems. It is critical to understand what this entails; most networked systems are designed to receive data from a specific sensor. For example, an air defence system is designed to receive target acquisition and tracking data from its own bespoke radars, whose data is formatted for that system’s fire control and battle management systems. The concept of JADC2 holds that the overarching battle management system and C2 network supporting multidomain operations should be able to rapidly receive, interpret, weight and assign actions in response to any data it receives and distribute it in a format that is usable by any other asset or weapons system connected to the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-where-is-jado-now&quot;&gt;I. Where is JADO Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of JADO is being explored through a series of experiments led by the US services that are designed to examine how it can be realised under the aegis of JADC2. JADC2 is both an approach and a procurement effort; it requires the US services to establish common data standards so that information can be shared seamlessly between them, as well as the procurement of new communications architectures that allow that information to be shared. However, it also requires a change in C2 culture with greater thought given to the synchronised, optimal allocation of resources, force positioning and decision-making. There are already several technical efforts underway within each service, which sit underneath the overall JADC2 effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Air Force is essentially the lead service on JADC2, with its primary efforts in this regard being channelled into its ABMS programme. ABMS is being developed in line with the Joint Warfighting Concept that will shape the doctrines created by the US services to define their role in JADO. JADC2 is the system that will enable US commanders to connect any sensor system to any effector. It is notionally a joint effort, although US Air Force officials have stressed that the technologies developed by the Army and Navy are designed to dovetail into the ABMS. In addition to integrating C2 efforts from across the US armed forces, JADC2 is also expected to integrate the US nuclear arsenal into the same network of sensors and effectors, although details on that effort are classified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABMS itself was originally intended to replace the E-3 AWACS before it was expanded to become a programme that will procure equipment and software, as well as implement new C2 and data policies. The US Air Force’s experiments within ABMS have demonstrated the ability to transmit data from Army and Navy radars to F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning fighter aircraft; it has been used in defence of US space assets and to engage cruise missiles. The US Air Force has also demonstrated the use of a KC-46 Pegasus tanker aircraft as a communications node that was used to relay information from fourth- to fifth-generation aircraft. The KC-46 application of the ABMS programme has become the first material step, taking it from a purely experimental standing to an in-service capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Army has launched Project Convergence, which is seeking to test the ability of national-level intelligence assets to coordinate and direct long-range fires with the assistance of AI. Project Convergence was established by the US Army Futures Command to test a single use case; a sensor-to-shooter link to enhance and test the ability of in-service systems to pass data between themselves. Its first iteration in 2020 proved that sensor-to-shooter time could be reduced from an average of 14 minutes to a few seconds. However, it also revealed that many of the systems in service with the US armed forces could not pass data to each other in compatible forms, leading to the realisation that the network that facilitates the flow of information is the centre of gravity as far as JADO is concerned. Project Convergence has since expanded to seven use cases and the establishment of the Joint Systems Integration Lab, which is charged with practising the movement of data between systems. Its work has been deemed vital to realising JADC2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Army’s technical contribution in the land domain is the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN), which has experimented with 4G and 5G and hybrid cloud architectures to support mounted and dismounted operations, including the movement of large data sets with low latency. The US Army has also moved its integrated air and missile defence (IADS) Battle Command System (IBCS) into low-rate initial production. The system enables assets from multiple domains to be integrated into a single air defence network. When provided with a suitable relay and datalink translation node (in this case an ‘EMC2’ network bridge on a U-2), IBCS has been used to coordinate an engagement between F-35 and the Army Field Artillery Tactical Data System. In the land domain at least, experimentation with JADO has made clear that passing data between systems in a usable form is the primary challenge to be overcome and emphasises that this is the centre of gravity around which the success of the project will turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Navy is focused on Project Overmatch, a secretive effort about which little is known except for the intention to introduce an AI-enabled network architecture and facilitate distributed operations through manned–unmanned teaming. Project Overmatch builds on the progress already made under the NIFC-CA programme, which was developed as an advanced version of what was initially termed ‘cooperative engagement capability’ (CEC) whereby aircraft and surface ships could share target track information and guide each other’s weapons in flight. In its fully operational state the NIFC-CA architecture currently connects surface combatant ships equipped with Aegis Baseline 9 or a later version of the powerful Aegis air and missile defence system to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler fast jets, and E-2D Advanced Hawkeye AWACS aircraft of the carrier air group (CAG). Its primary function is to create a fused recognised air picture which is fed by all the radars on ships and in the air back to the operations centre on the aircraft carrier itself. This allows a huge increase in the effective resolution and coverage of the whole fleet’s radar coverage. It is especially effective at increasing detection ranges against small or stealthy targets such as advanced anti-ship missiles and fifth-generation fighter aircraft due to the ability to exploit the dispersed positions of the various contributing radar sensors for multi-static triangulation. As a secondary function, NIFC-CA was designed to enable assets in the task group to designate targets for and guide each other’s missile systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way in which the US Navy developed NIFC-CA is potentially highly instructive for the UK and other Allied nations looking to invest in similar capabilities in their own forces. Rather than making NIFC-CA into a major acquisition programme of record, the US Navy inserted common network connectivity and data standards into the requirements within the major acquisition/modernisation programmes for specific platforms that were judged most critical for a specific mission – in this case counter-air and missile defence. The mission hinged most critically on the forward sensors on the E-2C/D Hawkeye AWACS, the later cancelled Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and the SM-3 and SM-6 ‘shooters’ used by the Aegis combat system onboard US guided missile destroyers and cruisers. Therefore, these systems were prioritised in terms of investment in unlocking shared situational awareness and third-party targeting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since NIFC-CA was not a major acquisition platform for a poorly defined future connectivity goal, but rather a budgetarily small programme with the power to insert requirements into pre-existing equipment acquisition or modernisation programmes, it did not fall foul of any of a series of major budget cuts over the decade of primary development. Even when JLENS was cancelled, this did not endanger NIFC-CA as a whole. Furthermore, once the cooperative engagement capabilities and combined situational awareness enabled by NIFC-CA in its early form had been demonstrated, it was easier to both justify the funding for and articulate the requirements needed to integrate other platforms, such as F-35C. Consequently, NIFC-CA is currently delivering real-time shared situational awareness and cooperative engagement capabilities between US Navy vessels, aircraft and weapons far in excess of what has yet been achieved by more ambitious but less well-defined US Air Force programmes, such as ABMS. The more ambitious Project Overmatch builds on the progress already made by the US Navy with an incremental and mission-specific approach to unlocking increased combat effectiveness through cross-domain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with this sort of operational capability, tangible UK progress in making JADO-style capabilities a practical reality remains largely experimental. The MoD has specified a guiding ambition to develop the capability to conduct MDI in doctrine and strategy publications such as JCN 1/20, and the Integrated Operating Concept. However, most practical investment is currently being undertaken by experimental establishments within each service. One example is the RAF’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), which has taken a somewhat different approach from the US to the problem of joint force connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking to build connectivity through feeds and common applications to link platforms or services, the RCO has focused initially on creating a common data environment called Nexus. The idea behind Nexus is to provide a virtual environment which acts as a Defence-owned portal where other platforms, networks, sensors and applications can both request and feed in data, according to published integration standards. Nexus concentrates on metadata so that applications and platforms alike can see what and who is doing what and where (at varying classifications) across the network, without having to off-board data wholesale as a standard procedure. This keeps baseline bandwidth demands low, and ensures that when a connected user specifically requests detailed data, there is sufficient capacity to pass it through the network along paths which have already been defined using the basic metadata. The RCO conducted flight trials with a hand-carried Nexus portal and a virtual communications hub application called Raven in 2021 on a Voyager tanker, and demonstrated the ability to pull data from satellite communications and a range of other sources into a common operating picture in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the creation of such a virtual data indexing and exchange medium is a significant step, it remains to be seen if it can be scaled up to meet the requirements of the whole force. It also does not by itself solve the problem of how to generate sufficiently low-latency real-time connectivity between joint force assets to enable third-party weapons cueing or guidance. Therefore, Nexus does not fill the same niche for the UK as NIFC-CA does for the US Navy or ABMS does for the US Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-vignette-1-sead-in-eastern-europe&quot;&gt;II. Vignette 1: SEAD in Eastern Europe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022, the once-theoretical spectre of a confrontation with Russian conventional forces in Eastern Europe has gone from the highest-risk/lowest-likelihood scenario at the top of NATO threat estimates to an unavoidable priority for future force planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance of the Russian aerospace forces’ fixed-wing and rotary assets during the initial two months of the war was notably poor – Russia failed to destroy the Ukrainian air force, or exert significant influence on the battles on the ground. This was, in large part, due to its inability to conduct effective suppression/destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD). Ukraine’s continued ability to operate its various mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems forced Russian aircraft to operate at very low altitude to take advantage of radar-horizon limitations and terrain for cover, but this left them vulnerable to anti-aircraft artillery and man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS) fire. The majority of combat air losses on both sides during the first phase of the war have been caused by SAMs and MANPADS – with the latter posing a threat precisely because the presence of the former forces both sides to operate at very low level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should prompt renewed prioritisation of SEAD/DEAD capability for NATO air forces, since at present only the US Air Force can field credible answers to the sorts of mobile SAM tactics used by both sides in Ukraine. Therefore, the first vignette in this paper examines where targeted investment in JADO-style capabilities within the UK’s joint force might add greatest benefit during a SEAD/DEAD operation against Russian forces in a geographically constrained flashpoint confrontation in Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and its allies would face three primary operational challenges during any SEAD/DEAD operation. The first would be detecting, identifying, mapping and then targeting the key long-range sensors, SAM systems and command nodes which provide the overall coordination for an IADS and allow it to threaten assets at long ranges. The second would be detecting, suppressing and then destroying the more numerous medium- and short-range mobile SAM batteries and systems which move with enemy ground forces. 45 The third challenge would be achieving sufficient effect against these two categories of targets (and their crews) to enable air superiority to be achieved, without taking unacceptable attrition in airframes or running out of critical munitions in the process. Any enemy air superiority assets would also need to be tracked and engaged if they attempted to engage UK or allied SEAD/DEAD assets, although NATO proficiency in the offensive/defensive counter-air mission set is already sufficient to provide a level of overmatch against any likely aerial adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time pressure is also likely to be a major factor, since the UK and most other Western nations depend heavily on the firepower and ISR delivered by air forces to allow their relatively small ground and maritime forces to achieve success against enemies able to field greater mass and firepower. Therefore, there would be heavy time pressure to achieve SEAD/DEAD results so that close air support and airborne ISR aircraft could be used freely within the area of operations. To work out where the greatest benefits might be gained from investment to allow joint, cooperative real-time engagements in such an operation, it is first necessary to identify the critical sensor and shooter platforms across the joint force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the potentially critical assets within the UK’s joint force are relatively easy to identify for any SEAD/DEAD campaign. For the first challenge of detecting, identifying and mapping the key long-range sensors and C2 nodes, standoff signals intelligence (SIGINT), electronic intelligence (ELINT) and radar-surveillance platforms – most obviously the RC-135W Airseeker and the new E-7A Wedgetail – would be critical in the run-up to any operation. However, once combat starts these aircraft would need to operate from beyond the reach of the long-range S-400 or S-300V4 SAM systems within a Russian IADS. This is because of their large signature, need to operate at high altitudes where long-range SAMs are most effective, and limited self-protection or evasion capabilities. Furthermore, many SIGINT and ELINT intercepts require significant processing and analysis before they can be fully exploited to help map an IADS and so incorporating an asset such as RC-135W into a JADC2-style real-time data sharing and targeting architecture might add only relatively marginal value compared to current processes. E-7A Wedgetail, by contrast, will be taking over from the E-3D Sentry as a key airborne battlespace management and C2 node within whatever new architectures are designed for combat air and joint forces use. As such, despite its likely position several hundred kilometres from the front lines during combat operations, it will remain a key communications relay and C2 node during active SEAD/DEAD operations, especially as a connective node between the air component and other elements of the force. Therefore, the E-7A is an example of where investing in radical improvements in the ability to exchange data in real time with forward sensors and long-range fires assets across all domains is likely to result in significant efficiency gains for the whole force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once combat operations begin, the most critical sensor nodes will be those that can detect, identify and track high-value enemy sensors, SAMs and C2 nodes from inside the threat range they pose. Obvious candidates within the UK’s current order of battle include the F-35B Lightning II and infiltrated special operations forces (SOF) teams. Both have the potential capability to get relatively close to threat systems covertly and can carry sophisticated sensors. The F-35’s sensor suite is particularly well suited to both hunting key nodes within an IADS and enabling more routine SEAD/DEAD efforts against mobile SAM systems in an ongoing campaign. This is because its sensors and software allow even a single aircraft to rapidly triangulate the position of a hostile SAM radar in flight more effectively than a whole flight of previous-generation ‘Wild Weasel’ F-16CJs with dedicated SEAD sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the F-35 and SOF teams have limited capabilities for direct kinetic attacks due to their relatively small numbers within the overall UK force structure, the need to husband limited munitions carriage capacity for key targets, and the need to avoid detection while deep in hostile territory. In other words, there is a significant mismatch between the ISTAR capabilities and the level of lethality which these assets can project into a hostile IADS when working alone. Therefore, in a SEAD/DEAD context, both F-35B and infiltrated SOF teams are likely to represent key UK sources of real-time situational awareness about key IADS targets, and also force elements whose lethality and survivability would be greatly increased by the ability to call in long-range firepower from other assets in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess which potential ‘shooters’ would bring the most benefit from JADC2-style connectivity with these forward sensors in a SEAD/DEAD operation, the first question is which platforms are likely to be able to deploy standoff weapons from sufficient range? Shooters must be able to threaten targets without unacceptable risk to sustainably leverage the situational awareness generated by the F-35Bs, SOF teams or other forward sensors for increased lethality. Within the UK joint force there are limited potential options, which makes prioritisation for investments in JADO-style cooperative engagement capabilities easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One clear candidate would be the guided multiple launch rocket systems (GMLRS) which currently provide the British Army’s long-range artillery firepower. GMLRS can fire rockets out to 70 km with submunition warheads that make each one lethal against lightly armoured vehicles across a spread pattern on impact. If the British Army’s GMLRS were equipped with such munitions, they would potentially be ideal for use against SAM batteries in the field. Furthermore, the UK has signalled its intention to procure the precision strike missile (PrSM) for its GMLRS launchers, which would provide a long-range precision strike capability of 499 km. PrSM has also been tested with a multi-mode seeker that would enable the missile to track and engage radars, which is expected to be included in the Spiral 1 upgrade of the missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other options could include Royal Navy surface or submerged vessels firing Tomahawk land attack missiles (TLAMs), or RAF Typhoons with Storm Shadow cruise missiles. However, due to their high cost and consequently limited inventory capacity, large cruise missiles such as Storm Shadow and TLAMs are likely to be reserved for high-value targets during a SEAD/DEAD mission such as long-range target acquisition radars, command centres and command vehicles. Therefore, they might benefit from real-time target data from penetrating ISTAR assets during the initial phases of any campaign, but would be less critical during the later DEAD phases, where the primary targets are likely to be mobile medium- and short-range SAM batteries. Against these targets, less costly and shorter-ranged munitions would be needed for viable mass of fires to be achieved. Therefore, likely candidates would be RAF Typhoons with SPEAR 3 (if it were purchased for the Typhoon Force), conventional Army AS90 or other 155-mm artillery batteries within range of SAM systems near the enemy front lines, and possibly AH-64E Apache gunships equipped with Hellfire or JAGM missiles. The point is that potential priorities for investment if SEAD/DEAD is chosen as a policy-relevant mission can be identified relatively easily by assessing where lethality would be most significantly increased through tactical real-time sensor-shooter integration across domains, compared to more traditional joint operations integrated at the operational or campaign level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from increased lethality, another aspect to potentially consider is which platforms would benefit most in terms of survivability from JADC2-style connectivity during a SEAD/DEAD operation. This is more difficult to define than lethality enhancement, since the survivability of any given platform is based more on contextual factors, including the risk appetite of both the attacking and defending force and the tactics each employ. However, a basic starting point would be to note that in a SEAD/DEAD operation the assets that might see increased survivability from JADC2-style connectivity are those which will be expected to operate within the missile engagement zone (MEZ) of enemy SAM systems (and possibly aircraft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the competition phase, before kinetic warfare begins, ISTAR assets conducting mapping of the IADS and airspace monitoring may well be operating within the MEZ of long-range enemy SAMs. The same may be true of tanker aircraft conducting aerial refuelling for both ISTAR and combat air patrol orbits close to adversary territory. If they perceive a direct conflict as inevitable or desirable, the adversary might attempt to open hostilities by conducting long-range SAM launches at these high-value enablers while they are within range. Given the lack of agility and limited self-defence options available to airliner-derived platforms, the ability to receive the earliest possible warning of hostile missile launches from any available sensor is critical to increasing their odds of survival. The Voyager MRTT in particular will be a key part of any air operation due to the critical nature of aerial refuelling capabilities for all fast jet and most ISTAR operations. Once shooting starts, tanker orbits will be pushed significantly further back from potential threats, which will keep them safer but means that each fuel offload grants less time on-mission for combat air assets. The centrality of the Voyager MRTT to almost all significant RAF air operations, and its consequent ubiquitous presence in the battlespace, is why it has already been chosen for airborne trials of the new Nexus common data platform and Raven communications node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enhance the survivability of key assets such as the Voyager MRTT, the most valuable airborne connection in a SEAD context is likely to be the F-35, since its electro-optical/infra-red surveillance suite can detect, classify and track missile and rocket launchers from hundreds of kilometres away in any direction around the aircraft. Ground-based long-range missile defence radars such as the MPQ-65 and AN/TPY-2 used by allied Patriot and THAAD batteries could also provide advance warning to airborne assets of long-range SAM launches due to their high flight apexes and consequent similarity to ballistic missiles. As will be seen in Vignette 2, these missile defence assets are also likely to benefit in situational awareness terms from being linked via such enablers to forward air assets for their own mission sets. Orbital missile launch detection and tracking capabilities would also be a potentially useful source of launch warning information if they were able to process the signatures of long-range SAMs and relay warnings in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vignette is not intended to imply that SEAD/DEAD is necessarily one of the critical missions against which initial UK investments in enabling practical JADO-style capability should be judged. Rather, it is intended to illustrate that considering how the existing and projected force structure would need to be employed against a notional mission set can guide analysis towards the assets that would likely give the greatest return on investment in improved connectivity across domains. In the case of the SEAD/DEAD mission, even a superficial examination of the force structure suggests that necessarily limited early investment could deliver significant increases in combat effectiveness without needing to achieve whole force transformation along the lines of American JADO efforts. The UK has a small number of assets that could be tasked with covertly penetrating defended areas, and which can carry potent sensors, but have limited organic firepower. It also has a limited range of assets that can deploy long-range firepower capabilities but which are reliant on off-board targeting information to hit elusive targets from a safe distance in a high-intensity scenario. Therefore, connecting these two sets of capabilities would be a natural place to invest in delivering an initial real-time cross-domain connectivity programme for the UK if SEAD/DEAD is assessed as an important mission set. The survivability of critical enabler nodes, such as tankers, which lack organic self-defence and evasion capabilities, could also potentially be significantly enhanced by being connected to force elements able to provide early warning of enemy long-range missile launches. They would likely also be present in theatre anyway due to their key roles. Therefore, they might also make logical sense as a priority for early upgrades to enhance their real-time connectivity with other force elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, a brief examination of the critical assets for a notional SEAD/DEAD campaign suggests that if this mission were chosen as a key planning task, the MoD could usefully prioritise initial MDI/JADO-style cross-domain connectivity investment towards penetrating assets, long-range precision fires capabilities and large enabler aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-vignette-2-integrated-air-and-missile-defence&quot;&gt;III. Vignette 2: Integrated Air and Missile Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vignette examines a notional scenario where the UK is required to provide an element of an IAMD capability for a European force that has been forward deployed to the Middle East in an uncertain political climate with an evolving insurgency led by a regional actor. Across current and future deployments of this type, the threat to British and allied troops deployed on the ground is likely to be increasingly significant and sophisticated. In any political environment where tolerance of casualty risk is limited, having a credible IAMD solution for forward deployed forces is likely to be increasingly essential for operational viability. However, providing IAMD to forward deployed forces is a complex challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat environment has developed considerably over the past decade due to the democratisation of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) and the proliferation of larger remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS) that can be used as munitions in their own right and also to rapidly cue in long-range fires with precision. Whereas past forces would have to contend only with an opponent’s air force and incoming rocket artillery, a European force deployed anywhere in the world today will likely face threats from armed sUAS and RPAS, as were encountered by Russian forces deployed to Khmeimim Airbase in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More complex missile threats have also proliferated. Houthi attacks against critical national infrastructure in Saudi Arabia have often come from different directions simultaneously, and been conducted across a wide geographical area, forcing the available Saudi air defences to be dispersed, thus diminishing their efficacy. Iran itself has demonstrated the ability to conduct attacks against American bases; the 2020 ballistic missile strikes against the Al Asad air base in western Iraq are the most prominent demonstrations of this capability. Sixteen ballistic missiles were fired at the base in retaliation for the assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, 11 of them – each carrying a 1,000-lb warhead – hit the base, causing extensive damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the future threat environment for UK forces deployed to the region is likely to be characterised by a mix of massed sUAS and loitering munitions, as well as higher-end cruise and ballistic missiles, used together in such a way as to increase the complexity of the IAMD challenge. Given this, more traditional siloed deployments of air and missile defence systems, such as Phalanx-B to guard Camp Victory in Iraq from rockets, artillery and mortar rounds, or Patriot PAC-3 batteries to reduce the threat to Eastern European allies from short-range ballistic missiles in 2022, are likely to be insufficient. No one system can efficiently or effectively cover the threat spectrum adequately. It follows that enhancing the ability of UK systems to connect to a common recognised air picture, and the ability to link together and cross-cue different sensors and effectors for layered effects, is likely to offer the best means to increase combat effectiveness for IAMD coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary challenge in any IAMD scenario remains the detection and tracking of incoming threats, and so protecting a UK deployment in the Middle East against the sorts of potential threats outlined would require the provision of persistent omni-directional air situational awareness across all the likely incoming threat altitudes, ranges and speed bands. This is an extremely difficult requirement to meet within the UK’s current order of battle, but in principle it requires the ability to combine the outputs from as many of the available ground-, maritime- and air-based radars and other sensors as possible into a common situational awareness picture. Obvious candidates within the existing force structure include the Giraffe Agile Multi-Beam radar that forms a core part of the British Army’s Sky Sabre medium-range air defence system, the Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) radar mounted on the RAF’s new E-7A Wedgetail AWACS aircraft, the Sampson radar on any Type 45 destroyers operating in littoral waters nearby, and the smaller radars carried by counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) solutions such as Drone Dome or ORCUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the IAMD threat encompasses such a broad range of target sizes, speeds and ranges means that operational effectiveness is likely to be disproportionately improved if systems optimised to cover different threat bands and altitudes can be linked together to create a combined situational awareness picture in real time. For threats coming in at close to ground level, sUAS and loitering munitions are likely to be a particularly challenging problem set, since these systems often have a low radar cross section and very small electro-optical/infra-red signature, and can travel extremely slowly. These properties, together with clutter from uneven ground, vegetation and buildings, make them particularly difficult to track and engage with traditional air defence radar systems. The UK has a limited ability to counter these threats in the form of its Drone Dome system procured from Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in 2018, which is designed to target sUAS using soft-kill effects. Additionally, the RAF has developed the ORCUS C-UAS system with Leonardo, which also employs soft-kill effects to defeat sUAS, although only four are expected to be delivered. Complex threats such as cruise missiles and RPAS can be countered by the Army’s Sky Sabre, which provides a detection range of 120 km and an engagement range of 25 km. It is claimed to be capable of hitting a target the size of a tennis ball travelling at the speed of sound. Importantly, Sky Sabre is already capable of sharing data with Royal Navy and RAF assets in theatre via the Link 16 tactical datalink. Building on these foundations, an obvious priority candidate for investment in automated, real-time cross-domain connectivity in an IAMD context would be the RAF’s new E-7A Wedgetail. It not only carries a high-resolution MESA radar that can contribute a look-down view of low-flying targets at far greater ranges than land-based radars but is also the standard Link 16 network gateway that would already be expected to interface between airborne and ground-based IAMD assets to build a common recognised air picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of ‘shooters’, the list of UK systems that can be considered for integration is currently quite short but in need of expansion to properly cover the wide range of potential threats. They include: Drone Dome and ORCUS for C-UAS effects; Starstreak and its vehicle-mounted high-velocity missile variant for short-range air defence; Sky Sabre for medium-range air defence; and the Royal Navy’s ship-borne CAMM short-range and Aster 15 and 30 medium-/long-range missiles as part of the Type 45 Destroyer’s Sea Viper air defence system. The ability to integrate high-end land-based capabilities such as Patriot PAC-3 or THAAD fielded by allies and partner nations would significantly increase potential effectiveness from both a ‘shooter’ and a ‘sensor’ point of view. In addition, any IAMD C2 network must incorporate high-fidelity data about friendly and civilian air operations in the airspace in question. Without an accurate, common and comprehensive recognised air picture it is very challenging to manage IAMD engagements safely and effectively. This requirement for deconfliction is another reason why E-7A, as the single best ‘source of truth’ within the air component about the aerial battlespace, would be a high-gain priority for any efforts to enhance IAMD effectiveness through JADC2-style connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK already has a somewhat developed capability that can be used to integrate sensors and effectors from multiple domains into a single IAMD. The SkyKeeper system from Lockheed Martin UK has been developed and refined to meet the Land Environment Air Picture Provision (LEAPP) capability requirement. A contract for its upgrade and service life extension was awarded in January 2022, which will improve the capabilities of the truck-mounted system and extend its service life to 2029. SkyKeeper can integrate C-UAS, counter-rocket and mortar (C-RAM) and conventional air defence assets into a single recognised air picture for the operators of each system. In the future, the system is claimed to have significant growth potential for use as a battlespace C2 network, which would allow incoming threats to be identified and then allocated to the most suitable of a potentially wide variety of shooters such as C-RAM, Sky Sabre or C-UAS effectors. The current SkyKeeper version unveiled in 2019 can receive data feeds from most sensors and transmit target tracking data using common data links such as Link 16 from air assets and Link 11 from naval assets. Lockheed Martin UK also claims that it can integrate the wide-area sense and detect sights of Ajax into the system, and can also integrate data from the F-35 Lightning II into the network if required. This would be a significant expansion of the current LEAPP requirement set, but illustrates that there are already networking solutions in place with UK forces that could potentially be used as building blocks for increasing the real-time integration of sensors and potentially shooters from across the joint force in an IAMD context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vital importance of a high-fidelity common recognised air picture, and the multifaceted nature of the potential threats ranging from sUAS to salvoes of ballistic and cruise missiles that might face UK forces deployed in the Middle East make the priorities clear for early investments in JADC2-style cross-domain connectivity if IAMD is identified as a priority mission set for the future joint force. Significant increases in effectiveness and operational flexibility could be expected if existing network and C2 capabilities such as LEAPP that currently focus on connecting systems in a single domain could be expanded or linked to allow routine real-time data exchange with airborne sensor nodes such as the E-7A Wedgetail, F-35 and Crowsnest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, enabling full-spectrum IAMD coverage in a theatre as complex as the Middle East with capabilities currently in the UK inventory is unlikely to be possible. Seamless data sharing with allied ground-based capabilities such as Patriot PAC-3 and THAAD, as well as E-3A/F/G AWACS, would be necessary for deconfliction purposes but would also be a high priority due to the potential improvements to mutual sensor and shooter coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-vignette-3-contested-freedom-of-navigation-operations&quot;&gt;IV. Vignette 3: Contested Freedom of Navigation Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy conducted a potentially opposed FONOP in June 2021 when HMS Defender sailed close to the Russian-occupied territory of Crimea in the Black Sea. During this operation, Defender was harassed by Russian attack aircraft and gunboats and locked up by shore-based radar systems. The Royal Navy has also conducted FONOPs in the South China Sea close to artificial reefs built by the People’s Liberation Army Navy to create illegal bastions of territory claims and area-denial system coverage. The US Navy frequently conducts FONOPs, and they are seen by many NATO nations as a crucial politico-military tool to assert rights of access to the global commons against aggressive attempts to change borders or interdict sea lines of communication (SLOCs) by force. With Russia committed to long-term confrontation with the West following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and China continuing its policies of attempting to change the status quo in both the South and East China seas, FONOPs are likely to remain an important tool for Western policymakers in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the continuing development and proliferation of highly capable anti-ship missiles, submarines and more novel potential threats, such as swarms of sUAS and loitering munitions, will all ensure that even major surface action groups will face considerable danger during contested FONOPs at times of heightened tension. The US Navy’s NIFC-CA architecture was developed precisely to enhance the survivability and lethality of naval task forces against high-end threats in a warfighting context by greatly improving the situational awareness and weapon effectiveness of the destroyers and aircraft against incoming threats. At a less ambitious scale, it is worth examining where similar automated C2 and data-sharing functions between platforms would add most value for the UK in the context of FONOPs to defend access to contested SLOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar fashion to the preparatory stages of a SEAD/DEAD campaign, the first challenge in reducing the risk to a planned FONOP would be to try to detect, identify and then track the locations of the primary anti-ship threats in the contested maritime area. These will generally comprise coastal defence cruise missiles and the ground-based and possibly airborne radars that provide them with target information, as well as, potentially, missile-carrying small-boat swarms, sUAS and in the case of larger powers possibly aircraft and submarines. The nature of the threat in each geographic context will determine the scope and feasibility of mitigation and (if necessary) defence or deterrence measures to ensure a FONOP can be conducted successfully. However, in all cases a thorough understanding of enemy force dispositions and capabilities will be essential. Without such an understanding it is impossible to adequately protect a vessel conducting FONOPs during periods of high tension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge will be to ensure that the ship or task group is provided with as many credible defence and/or retaliatory options as possible to deter hostile action by denial and/or punishment respectively. The third will be ensuring adequate connectivity between the ship conducting the FONOP, any supporting assets, and higher command levels who can provide rapid guidance on changing political circumstances, rules of engagement or orders throughout the period of vulnerability. This may be very difficult given that an adversary is likely to make liberal use of electronic warfare to interfere with the sensors and communications of the ship and any supporting elements, as such actions signal displeasure and create windows of kinetic vulnerability without the escalation implications of kinetic force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence collection assets being used to ascertain the localised threat nature and location of key adversary capabilities are unlikely to be a major priority for integration if they will be conducting their missions well in advance of the FONOP in question. By its nature, the side conducting a FONOP generally has a significant degree of control over the timing of the passage through the contested waterway. Therefore, increasing the ability to pull information off ISR assets in real time through greatly increased connectivity is unlikely to provide more than a marginal increase in the efficiency of such preparatory activity compared to current practices. On the other hand, on the day of the FONOP itself, as the ship(s) in question sail towards the contested area, the ability to provide real-time connectivity between supporting ISR assets and the surface action group could add significant value. ISR assets such as P-8 Poseidon or RC-135W Rivet Joint may be able to detect any changes in the movement patterns and electronic emissions of adversary ground-based and maritime threat systems which could signal intent to conduct an attack. The faster this information can be relayed to the task group, the more effective any defensive and/or retaliatory measures can be made, and the greater the deterrent effect on an adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the FONOP transit itself, the ship’s onboard radar systems would provide the primary source of defensive situational awareness, alongside the sensors of any embarked aviation – such as the MX15 sensor ball and SeaSpray AESA radar mounted on the Royal Navy’s Wildcat HMA.2 helicopters. The outputs from these sensors are theoretically already supposed to be well integrated via the Merlin Mk2 Crowsnest system which (if present) would also provide another source of wide area radar surveillance to spot incoming threats. These systems should, on their own, provide excellent radar coverage of both the aerial and surface threat picture during the hours of the transit itself. However, the interception of incoming missile threats would still rely on the radar picture from the ship’s own sensors, which restricts the range at which such engagements can be conducted against sea-skimming threats. Sufficiently high-resolution/low-latency data sharing between airborne sensors (including F-35B, if in theatre) and the Type 45 to enable third-party missile guidance for Aster 30 could enable the ship to engage incoming threats beyond the radar horizon of its own sensor coverage. Against supersonic or hypersonic threats this would significantly enhance the odds of a successful defensive engagement and might also allow the launcher to be targeted rapidly with naval gunfire or TLAMs to prevent further hostile launches. This is precisely what NIFC-CA allows for the US Navy. However, the Royal Navy lacks a long-range missile capability comparable to the US SM-3 and SM-6 series, and aside from the F-35B’s radar, the available airborne radars, which include Crowsnest and SeaSpray, may lack the technical capacity to provide missile guidance even if furnished with a sufficiently advanced ability to share data with both ship and missile in flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, NIFC-CA or JADC2-style connectivity with airborne assets with high-end sensors offers the opportunity to enhance the guidance quality and effective range against sea-skimming or surface threats for the missiles carried by Royal Navy ships during a contested FONOP. This would not only offer the potential for lower risk against a given threat but also lower the political escalation risk during an actual engagement – since the number of munitions fired can prove the symbolic difference between a skirmish and a major confrontation at the geopolitical level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same can be said of both the precision and need for any retaliatory strikes against shore-based or maritime attackers. From an escalation-control point of view, the ability to intercept incoming threats is preferable to needing to go after the enemy launch site/vehicle, if possible, but where the latter is desirable or necessary, it is better to use fewer missiles to accomplish the task. Therefore, there are potential efficiencies to be gained from investment in JADC2-style connectivity for the likely force package the UK might deploy for a contested FONOP. However, they are marginal compared to the potentially dramatic combat effectiveness gains identified if initial investment were focused on priority areas in the context of an IAMD or SEAD/DEAD mission set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is intended to illustrate that a mission-facing approach could help UK policymakers identify the most relevant and potentially easiest capabilities across the force to concentrate on integrating in the early tranches of necessarily sequential MDI/JADO-type transformation efforts. Currently, there is a widely held quasi-philosophical position across the UK, the US and the armed forces of other nations that future wars will be decided by whichever side can best manage and share data seamlessly across all force elements. The UK’s Joint Concept Note 1/20 makes clear that the MoD is committed to a vision of the future force in which seamless cross-domain connectivity and integration is the norm. However, this high-level vision does not translate neatly into programme deliverables and prioritisation decisions within stretched budgets and limited programme management capacity. Even ambitious transformation projects have to start somewhere, and well-targeted initial investments in integrating a limited number of key capabilities across the domains could deliver significant enhancements to whole-force combat effectiveness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Navy’s approach, with its NIFC-CA programme model, offers a potentially useful model for the UK to pursue JADC2-type connectivity across the force in more manageable and easily defined blocks. Rather than attempting root-and-branch change across the whole force simultaneously, the US Navy created an unprecedented level of real-time integration between surface warships, airborne assets and weapons in flight by focusing initially on connecting the core platforms essential to a given mission, and then building on the progress made once initial investment had yielded real-world results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, the lessons are clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MoD, and Strategic Command as the integrating authority, need to prioritise early investment in real-time data sharing and combined C2 capabilities between the platforms and systems likely to deliver the greatest improvement in combat effectiveness for the force in specific key mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mission-specific analysis can be used to identify which force elements would make most sense to concentrate early investment tranches on, by providing a framework through which to examine if and where advanced cross-domain data sharing and third-party targeting capabilities between specific platforms would add the most tangible value in an operational context.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, even a superficial analysis of kinetic mission sets such as the ones provided in this paper suggests that enhanced data sharing and third-party targeting capabilities linking key sensor assets, such as F-35, E-7A and SOF teams, with long-range precision fires and IAMD capabilities like GMLRS and Type 45, could greatly enhance combat effectiveness in challenging scenarios where the current force structure would struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that analysis of some mission sets may suggest that for many force elements the potential combat effectiveness gains from currently deliverable JADC2-style integration would offer significantly less in terms of return on investment in the near term than other options for that funding. This should not be seen as a bad thing since careful prioritisation is undoubtedly necessary across defence, given limited budgets, personnel headroom and programme management capacity. Therefore, choosing which assets across the joint force do not yet need to be connected by an all-singing, all-dancing network and automated C2 solution is perhaps just as important as identifying what assets ought to be connected with all possible speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of defence may eventually include something akin to the vision laid out in Joint Concept Note 1/20 and other top-level strategy documents; a completely connected joint force, fully integrated in real-time not only across all domains but also across government departments. However, there is a huge gulf between this ambition and the current state of the joint force. With limited resources and a host of urgent force modernisation and regeneration requirements, the UK’s short-to-medium investments in MDI/JADO-type capabilities will need to be incremental and focus on seamlessly connecting and integrating the assets that will see the greatest combat effectiveness increase from the capability to share real-time situational awareness and conduct joint engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

Much of the existing commentary focuses on how or when a Chinese attack on Taiwan could occur, but there is little discussion of the nonmilitary consequences of such a scenario for China and the world. This brief explores the implications of a Chinese attack on Taiwan based on reasonable, albeit speculative, assumptions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When considered more holistically, the implications of an attack on Taiwan would be grim for Beijing, even if Chinese forces “successfully” capture the island. China would probably be diplomatically and economically isolated from key advanced economies, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping would have to tread a narrow path to avoid dire consequences for China and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as a whole. This analysis helps clarify what could be at stake for the world and reaffirms the importance of deterring Beijing from contemplating such an attack on Taiwan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation has increased over the past several years that Beijing is accelerating plans for an invasion of Taiwan. While there is little doubt that Beijing seeks to fully annex Taiwan into the People’s Republic of China (PRC) one day, questions remain about the timing and methods that China might use to achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons Beijing might undertake a military campaign against Taiwan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long-standing territorial and national identity aspirations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xi’s own personal ambitions and sense of legacy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Addressing a perceived threat to its own security stemming from deepening U.S.-Taiwan defense cooperation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responding to perceived provocations from Taiwan, specifically a formal declaration of de jure and permanent independence from the PRC&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a great deal of commentary and analysis has explored how the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might undertake a military campaign to annex Taiwan, a critical — yet underemphasized — question remains regarding the types and magnitudes of costs Beijing would pay for such actions. Nearly all discussions of China’s potential invasion of Taiwan ignore the economic and diplomatic costs of such a move, make unrealistic assumptions about what China could achieve (including technological and economic gains), or otherwise minimize the challenges that China would face if an invasion of Taiwan were successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The below analysis is an initial exploration into some of these potential nonmilitary consequences for China. It does not seek to prove or disprove Beijing’s true intentions and timelines toward Taiwan, nor does it claim to know how Chinese leader Xi Jinping is assessing the risks and rewards of an invasion. Rather, it highlights costs that Beijing would likely face if it successfully invaded Taiwan, based on plausible assumptions of how China, Taiwan, the United States, the international community, and global investors would react.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, this brief looks at three distinct phases of a possible Chinese attack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The period leading up to an attack&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The period between the initial phase of an attack and the end of major conflict&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The period following a successful PLA invasion&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the analysis focused on how a successful invasion by the PLA would impact China’s economic, diplomatic, and political circumstances, this brief intentionally remains nonspecific about the type of attack or invasion it might launch. At a minimum, this analysis assumes that it would include the direct use of lethal force by the PLA’s air, land, and sea capabilities to defeat and subdue Taiwan’s military and to depose the civilian political leadership on the island. It also assumes that the U.S. military would intervene, but its actions would be limited and ultimately unsuccessful in halting the Chinese invasion. And it further assumes that no nuclear weapons would be used. Such assumptions are not predictions of actual outcomes, but rather necessary simplifications adopted so this brief can focus on the issue of costs associated with a relatively smooth path to military victory for Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any conflict in and around Taiwan would entail major economic, financial, diplomatic, and reputational costs for Beijing, both directly and indirectly. Even if China “won” in the military domain and thus accrued additional regional military benefits, its economic and diplomatic position would likely be substantially worse off. Simply put, China would have gained Taiwan but sacrificed its larger ambition of becoming a global and comprehensive superpower. This is the very definition of a Pyrrhic victory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even absent U.S. intervention, any conflict initiated by the PRC would have immediate and dramatically negative effects on China’s ability to import and export goods, on its domestic financial markets, on business sentiment, and on the exchange rate of its currency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s costs would significantly increase if the U.S. military intervenes meaningfully, even if delayed by several days or even weeks. The blunt geographic truth for China is that conflict in the Taiwan Strait would occur directly off the shore of its most economically important and populated provinces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even supposing Chinese troops could overcome Taiwan’s defenses, they would then occupy an island inhabited by a hostile population with a shattered local economy, including its semiconductor sector, while China itself would face severe economic and diplomatic repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise is necessarily speculative and requires many assumptions. Perhaps the most important ones are that Taiwan offers at least some resistance and that U.S. leadership can effectively organize some semblance of an anti-China coalition among advanced economies. In addition, forecasting the effects of major discontinuities requires considerations for societies’ potential reactions under stress rather than under normal conditions. History suggests that major crises can trigger or inspire rapid shifts in consensuses based on reevaluations of national, political, or cultural priorities that can supersede economic logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has compelling strategic reasons for deterring China from attacking Taiwan. This exercise is not intended to suggest that losing Taiwan to the PRC would be a positive outcome for Washington. Rather, the key point is that even in this dire scenario, China would still likely be the country that most suffers diplomatically and economically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimating the effects of such a conflict with any precision is extremely difficult, in part because there is no analogous historical case upon which to draw. The world’s two largest economies might be at war with each other. Global supply chains are far more integrated now than before World War II — or even World War I, which ended the first era of globalization. The disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine war are not a good proxy because Russia’s economy is far smaller than China’s, the conflict and Western response have not stopped key Russian exports, and Western powers are not directly engaged in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, this brief concludes that the implications of a PRC attack on Taiwan would be cataclysmic for China, the United States, and the world. Simply put, any attempt to achieve “reunification” through force is likely to fracture global geopolitics and economies far beyond today’s “partial decoupling” trends and preclude any long-term “national rejuvenation” for China’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phase-one-pending-chinese-attack-on-taiwan&quot;&gt;Phase One: Pending Chinese Attack on Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beijing’s preparation for an attack on Taiwan would likely alert foreign governments and investors to the impending conflict, but the signals would not be entirely clear.&lt;/strong&gt; These actions would include measures to mobilize its forces, insulate its economy and financial system, ready its population, and prepare the diplomatic space for a conflict that Chinese leaders might assume will entail enormous costs for the Chinese Communist Party. While Beijing would strive to obscure its intentions in some scenarios, the required military, economic, and political preparations would be at least partially detectable to the international community. Such observable signals might include stockpiling of munitions, a freeze on military demobilizations, and an intensification of bellicose propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States would warn of China’s military intentions, hoping to rally allies and deter Beijing.&lt;/strong&gt; The effectiveness of such warnings would depend on the strength of U.S. leadership, the state of Washington’s diplomatic relations with third countries, and the credibility of U.S. intelligence. Beijing would likely proceed toward an attack in a manner that clouds or frustrates U.S. efforts to assign blame to China, such as by claiming that Taiwan provoked Beijing by crossing red lines or even that Taiwan’s military attacked Chinese territory or a Chinese asset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some U.S. allies and partners would join Washington in warning of Beijing’s intentions.&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. allies — most likely including Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom — would coordinate planning for steps that could deter China. However, even among allies, the bar for assuming an attack on Taiwan is imminent would be high. The intensity of allied responses would thus largely depend on the credibility of U.S. intelligence, the strength of U.S. government statements and actions, and Taiwan’s own demonstrations that it took the threat seriously. This would include military preparations and the threat — or perhaps use of — economic sanctions on China to deter military action. On the other hand, the United States and its allies would be wary of acting too drastically, which might escalate the crisis, including by triggering responses from Beijing, precluding off-ramps for China, or damaging the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other governments would be slow to respond.&lt;/strong&gt; Some might believe Beijing’s actions are mere saber rattling, as some Western governments did ahead of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine despite clear warnings from Washington. Some leaders would hesitate because they want to avoid taking disruptive emergency measures not yet seen as justified by their uncertain or oblivious polities. Other leaders would try to avoid committing themselves to either side in a conflict. Behind the scenes, Beijing would likely be using all its diplomatic channels to pressure third countries to remain on the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International firms and investors would need to make important early decisions in an environment of extreme uncertainty.&lt;/strong&gt; Financial markets would be the first to respond, with strong downward pressure on Chinese assets and the renminbi’s exchange rate. Many foreign investors would assume the crisis will harm business sentiment in China and, even if resolved, at least incrementally slow the economy. Direct investors would be slower to respond than portfolio investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because Beijing’s true intentions, including the scope and scale of a possible attack, would not yet be entirely clear, many firms operating in China, Taiwan, or the broader region would adopt a “wait and see” approach.&lt;/strong&gt; Global headquarters would be looking to in-country staff for information and updates — though even staff in China and Taiwan would be struggling to interpret events. Because the costs of shifting supply chains or divesting from China could be substantial, many companies would delay making drastic decisions in the hope that a crisis never materializes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phase-two-period-of-conflict&quot;&gt;Phase Two: Period of Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A conflict over Taiwan would devastate the global economy, but the costs would be especially high for China.&lt;/strong&gt; The negative economic impact would be felt as soon as hostilities begin. Commercial shipping through the war zone and nearby ports would collapse, supply chains for many goods would seize up, and financial markets would panic — potentially even more so than during the 2008 global financial crisis. Beijing would likely impose emergency economic measures such as even stronger capital controls, selling Chinese assets abroad, stockpiling emergency supplies, suspending critical exports, rationing key imported goods, or restricting foreign travel. Early resistance by Taiwan’s military would compel China to take economically disruptive measures to protect its military assets in its eastern provinces and population centers from air or missile attacks from Taiwan or U.S. forces. Even a minimal level of U.S. military involvement would significantly disrupt this vital region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phase-one-pending-chinese-attack-on-taiwan-1&quot;&gt;Phase One: Pending Chinese Attack on Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phase-two-period-of-conflict-1&quot;&gt;Phase Two: Period of Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A conflict over Taiwan would devastate the global economy, but the costs would be especially high for China.&lt;/strong&gt; The negative economic impact would be felt as soon as hostilities begin. Commercial shipping through the war zone and nearby ports would collapse, supply chains for many goods would seize up, and financial markets would panic — potentially even more so than during the 2008 global financial crisis.

Even a minimal level of U.S. military involvement would significantly disrupt this vital region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The two most important determinants of the war’s intensity and duration — and thus economic impact — would be the degree to which Taiwan resists and whether the United States is engaged militarily. Neither condition is certain, but both are probable.&lt;/strong&gt; To assume Taiwan would not resist, one must have a bleak view of Taiwan’s civil society. To assume the United States would not engage militarily, one needs to at least assume that Beijing’s military operations would be extremely effective and quick while also not targeting U.S. forces in the region. Beijing would have an official pretense for any military action, but unless Taiwan took reckless actions, such as declaring independence, it is unlikely that leaders in Washington and other Western capitals would find them convincing. In the early days of the conflict, global firms and investors would assume that U.S. military intervention and general escalation pose high risks, absent extremely unlikely statements by Washington that explicitly disavow Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 2016 study by the RAND Corporation estimated that a year-long war between the United States and China would reduce China’s GDP by 25–35 percent and U.S. GDP by 5–10 percent.&lt;/strong&gt; However, the study did not examine the implications for global supply chains or estimate effects from sanctions, infrastructure damage, or cyberattacks. Given China’s subsequent economic growth, the economic damage ratios now are probably somewhat more in China’s favor, but the overall costs (considering all factors) could be considerably higher. A war would have an immediate impact on the three Chinese provinces nearest to Taiwan — Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang — which together account for 22 percent of China’s GDP and 17 percent of its population. Damage would not be limited to coastal provinces, however, because interior provinces are part of an intricate network of domestic supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most maritime trade and air freight within range of the war zone would be disrupted.&lt;/strong&gt; International shipping and logistics firms would try to reroute traffic around the conflict zone and would avoid entering ports in or near Taiwan. Shipping insurance premiums would surge. Chinese ports accounted for roughly 40 percent of shipping volume among the world’s 100 largest ports in 2020; six of China’s largest ports are near Taiwan and would likely be directly impacted by a Chinese attack. Nearly half of the global container fleet and five-sixths of the largest ships transit through the Taiwan Strait, most of which would be rerouted. A complete disruption of China’s trade would reduce global trade in added value by $2.6 trillion, or 3 percent of world GDP — and this figure, based on peacetime valuations of global supply chains, only captures the first-order effect on trade. In the short term, however, existing inventories of goods or supplies would mitigate the effect on global firms and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even in the early stages of a conflict, multinational corporations (MNCs) would face significant pressure to begin unwinding operations in China.&lt;/strong&gt; Managers’ foremost consideration in the hours and days after a Chinese attack would be employee safety, and many foreign MNCs would seek to exfiltrate foreign passport holders. Companies operating near the eastern coastline would likely halt operations even if they encounter no supply chain disruptions. MNCs exporting from or sourcing parts from China might try to shift production or inputs to other locations, although this would be expensive, and there would be competition from other firms doing the same thing with limited alternative capacity. MNCs operating in China for access to its domestic market would be the least likely to try to pull out because direct investments, such as factories and retail locations, are difficult to liquidate in a crisis. Such firms might conclude that even in dire scenarios, the Chinese market would still be enormous — at least after the conflict. However, they would fear the appropriation of their assets by Chinese authorities and the reputational costs in other markets if they remain in a China hostile to the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China would face significant capital-flight pressures and a massive selloff of Chinese assets.&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese citizens, companies, and investors — as well as foreign firms — would seek to jump the queue and avoid having their international capital ensnared by Western sanctions. While China already maintains stringent capital controls, the central bank would likely issue additional unofficial “window guidance” to China’s major state banks, directing them to halt outgoing transfers. Unofficial and illicit channels exist for motivated parties, but they are relatively narrow owing to regulators’ efforts to diminish their effectiveness. In addition to selling off onshore Chinese stocks, many investors would also dump their holdings of Chinese stocks listed on overseas exchanges. The exchange rate of the onshore and offshore renminbi would plunge, necessitating heavy interventions by the central bank to arrest the slide. As during other periods of heightened risk, global investors would flee to assets perceived as safe, especially U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. bank deposits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States would impose at least some economic sanctions on China in any scenario. But if U.S. forces were engaged, the sanctions would be severe, and Washington would probably coordinate with — or even compel — major allies to join such sanctions. U.S. politicians and the public would likely not tolerate continued direct trade or investment with China if U.S. forces suffer even a low number of casualties fighting Chinese forces, although indirect economic linkages would remain. Financial sanctions on major Chinese banks would have a devastating economic impact, including for U.S. firms and consumers. The expected costs of such actions suggest they would only be used in full once a conflict breaks out and the United States becomes militarily involved. If U.S. personnel start dying and the public sees bloody images of China’s attack on Taiwan, Western sentiment would likely turn swiftly and decidedly against China. A Western sanctions coalition could coalesce quickly, as happened after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in part because of lessons learned and coordination mechanisms established in response to the sanctions against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major U.S. allies, even if not engaged militarily, would likely support Washington’s efforts to punish China economically.&lt;/strong&gt; While China’s market and supply chains are critical for many international firms, overall, the United States is even more important as a consumer market, investment destination, and financial market. The European Union’s — even just Germany’s — economic and financial ties to the United States are far deeper than those with China. Perhaps more importantly, Europe’s political, cultural, and security ties with the United States would present European leaders with a binary choice they might otherwise hope to avoid. Washington would exert significant pressure on its allies to join its sanctions efforts; if the United States were engaged militarily, those requests might become ultimatums, which Western leaders would need to weigh against the expectation that China’s economic growth and liberalization has peaked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan’s economy would be shattered and cut off from most trade, losing the ability to export the majority of the world’s semiconductors and microchips.&lt;/strong&gt; Much of its infrastructure would be damaged during combat or from sabotage by local actors, and Taiwan’s ports would be well within the combat zone. This would halt Taiwan’s microchip exports, of which roughly 60 percent go to China as inputs into electronics that are then exported to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global supply chains for consumer electronics would be particularly damaged.&lt;/strong&gt; China’s exports of consumer electronics, such as smartphones and laptops, have accounted for nearly 40 percent of the global total since 2014. Because of shipping disruptions and possible suspensions of trade with advanced economies, China’s domestically produced microchips would also probably not be exported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even if the PLA were successful in seizing and holding Taiwan, Beijing would still face enormous economic, diplomatic, and political challenges.&lt;/strong&gt; The only plausible pathway to mitigating these challenges would be for China’s military operations in Taiwan to be quick (to shorten the window Washington has to respond) and clean (to minimize fighting and damage, including civilian casualties in Taiwan), as well as avoid triggering an international backlash, particularly from advanced economies. More realistically, an attack on Taiwan — even a successful one — would result in some level of U.S. military involvement, a direct response from Taiwan’s military and people, and international outrage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/83OVRSJ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China would occupy a new but significantly damaged and isolated “special administrative region,” which would face a severe economic contraction and be expensive to subdue, police, and rebuild.&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese military and security forces would contend with a restive population, even assuming local resistance is not prolonged. Reconstruction costs would be high and absorb much of Taiwan’s remaining fiscal capacity. The public on the mainland might object to spending Chinese resources to occupy and rebuild Taiwan, given that the island is nominally more developed than most of the mainland and its people are considered hostile. Chinese leaders probably would have planned for the post-war environment based on optimistic assumptions, in part because experts and planners would have been reluctant to suggest that Taiwan’s population is sincerely opposed to “reunification.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TSMC), would be severely damaged and unable to resume production of cutting-edge microchips.&lt;/strong&gt; Assuming TSMC is not affected during combat or destroyed by saboteurs, its seizure by Chinese forces would only give China a snapshot of its technology in an otherwise fast-moving global industry. Beijing would also need to coopt or compel TSMC’s employees to continue working for the firm. Furthermore, TSMC relies on foreign inputs, including for chip designs and chip-manufacturing equipment. The governments of key advanced economies would likely impose export controls on those inputs, even if this means losing access to leading-edge fabrication capabilities. Foreign firms reliant on TSMC for production would no longer consider its Taiwan facilities reliable even after reconstruction. However, TSMC’s overseas assets might continue operating, assisted by TSMC staff who escape Taiwan and perhaps after being acquired by other firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s economic and diplomatic relations with advanced economies would significantly deteriorate.&lt;/strong&gt; Western sanctions and export controls on China would probably persist for months or perhaps years after a conflict, even if U.S. military forces are defeated. In Washington, Tokyo, and some European capitals, there would be little to no political appetite to resume normal economic relations with a belligerent China. Both sides would suffer, but China would suffer more. In 2021, the Group of Seven (G7) economies — a reasonable proxy for the U.S. alliance network — had a collective GDP 65 percent larger than China’s, even at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates favorable to China, and directly absorbed 41 percent of China’s exports. China has little prospect of eliminating its key external economic dependences — technology, commodities, and the U.S. dollar — in the medium term. After a conflict, China would largely maintain access to commodities from emerging markets and developing countries. However, China would struggle to overcome technology export controls and sanctions based on the global dollar network, upon which its remaining trading partners would also remain reliant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s periphery would become increasingly hostile.&lt;/strong&gt; Any Chinese attack on Taiwan would provoke significant anxiety among China’s neighbors. If the United States were perceived to have intervened aggressively, even if ultimately unsuccessfully, U.S. credibility as a security partner would largely remain intact, if somewhat bruised. On the other hand, if U.S. intervention were seen as halfhearted, countries might put less stock in Washington as a security guarantor, and some might develop their own capabilities, including nuclear weapons, to deter China. Either way, China’s aggression would likely galvanize a surge in military spending and pronounced bandwagoning against Beijing by Japan, South Korea, Australia, and India, but also Vietnam and the Philippines. Most other emerging markets or developing countries, however, would probably try to remain neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annexing Taiwan would likely give Xi Jinping an initial bump in public approval, but the mounting costs of “state-building” would erode overall domestic confidence in the CCP.&lt;/strong&gt; Propaganda organs would seek to contain criticisms of the invasion, but the proximity of the conflict would make it difficult to obscure the likely military casualties. Such efforts would be further undermined by the vast network of overseas Chinese nationals with unfettered access to information on the invasion’s course and consequences. Beijing would probably feel forced to use terror and repression to subdue pockets of resistance (real or imagined) in Taiwan, and reports of such atrocities would inevitably filter through to the mainland population. An invasion of Taiwan and the associated occupation phase would also distract Beijing from addressing China’s pressing domestic agenda and economic headwinds. To take control of the narrative and tamp down on any domestic unrest (again, real or imagined), the CCP would feel compelled to flex all its coercive muscles, and thus China would enter a new and more protracted phase of its police state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s economy would be on a wartime footing, and its hope of achieving high-income status would be severely diminished.&lt;/strong&gt; Beijing would struggle with China’s overburdened fiscal system and state-sector debts amid capital outflows — and could face a systemic financial crisis. MNCs would expect Western sanctions and export controls to persist, while also forecasting far less potential from the Chinese market, and thus would generally maintain lower exposure to China. Foreign MNCs operating in China would fear asset nationalization, and even MNCs who want to remain or reinvest in China would face a Chinese government that scrutinizes companies representing “hostile” Western countries. China’s outbound investments and lending would be constrained. Amid draconian capital controls and a loss of foreign investor confidence in China’s trajectory and reforms, the renminbi would not substantially internationalize.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this initial exercise is to sketch out some of the likely responses to a Chinese attack on Taiwan and the associated political, economic, diplomatic, and strategic consequences Beijing would face. The conclusion reached is stark: China would court disaster if it launched an invasion across the Taiwan Strait. Even under optimistic assumptions about the combat performance of the PLA and the relatively muted or constrained military responses by Taiwan and the United States, there is a precariously narrow path Xi Jinping would need to follow to emerge from the gambit unscathed. Once more realistic assumptions begin to be layered in, the picture becomes dire for the CCP and China as a whole. Equally as significant, any Chinese attack on Taiwan would also have an extraordinary impact on the global economy, especially for U.S. partners and allies in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key strategic challenge for the United States remains to ensure Beijing never actively contemplates an attack on Taiwan. While it is likely Beijing broadly understands the costs associated with such an action, the increasing isolation of Chinese leader Xi Jinping and the concomitant rise in groupthink in Beijing’s policymaking circles means that one cannot assume Chinese leaders will continue to conduct a sound cost-benefit analysis. It thus remains critical to find direct and clear ways to communicate to Xi Jinping the costs he would face for undertaking any attack on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

Drawing lessons from the Cold War, the author distills six principles to guide crisis management among U.S. policymakers navigating an increasingly crisis-prone U.S.-China relationship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With U.S.-China relations already headed toward a more belligerent rivalry, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022 was bound to cause heartburn in Beijing. China responded with an elaborate show of force around the island: shooting missiles over Taiwan and into Japanese exclusive economic zone (EEZ) waters, firing rocket artillery into the Taiwan Strait, declaring a ring of maritime exclusion zones around Taiwan, and surging over 200 military aircraft and 50 ships into Taiwanese airspace and waters. Many now refer to the event as the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet compared to previous confrontations around Taiwan, the United States this time failed to play much of its appointed part. The Biden administration mostly stayed aloof, condemning China’s actions but not dispatching U.S. forces to confront China directly. If there was a crisis, it was largely one-sided, with China posturing and slinging missiles and the United States watching from the sidelines. The resulting U.S. coolness left China thrashing in a performative display that produced condemnations from Japan, Australia, and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This U.S. strategy might have been quietly brilliant, inviting China to stamp and roar and drive many countries further into a balancing coalition. The administration may have decided that a belligerent response would have been inappropriate given that it had been the action of a U.S. official that had sparked the crisis. But it remains to be seen if restraint was the right choice. The crisis arguably furnished China with an ability to set a new threshold for military intimidation in the strait and beyond. Some observers worried that U.S. moderation would encourage China to escalate its coercion in the future, a concern fueled in part by commentary in China that seemed to brag about the absence of a more forceful U.S. response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing seems clear: an era of persistent confrontations in U.S.-China relations has arrived. The escalating rivalry is, unavoidably, a long-term campaign for predominance in which each side makes investments, builds forces, and develops technologies to gain competitive advantage — as symbolized by the set of potent sanctions Washington recently imposed on Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. But it will also take a more perilous form as a series of discrete collisions that demand careful statecraft. Not all these events will be on the scale of the Taiwan Strait Crisis. Some could involve sudden disclosures of Chinese troops at foreign bases, large-scale cyber intrusions of U.S. systems, or proxy conflicts that emerge out of disputes over third parties. But some of the confrontations could be even violent and dangerous, such as outright Chinese military action against islands in the Taiwan Strait, an all-out blockade of Taiwan itself, or even seeming preparations for an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In dealing with the Taiwan issue and larger U.S.-China relations, the United States should keep firmly in mind that these are primarily political issues, which demand diplomatic solutions. Attending to the statecraft of the larger relationship is the essential route to avoiding and mitigating crises. But in intense rivalries, crises are likely to emerge despite such efforts. In such an era of persistent clashes, the United States will need criteria to guide its responses — a handbook for managing a series of skirmishes within the larger rivalry. This essay offers an initial down payment on such thinking by drawing lessons from the most recent U.S. experience with managing crises within a larger rivalry: the Cold War. It uses those lessons to suggest six principles for managing confrontations with China. The resulting approach is to get the fundamentals of a systemic competition right and then strike a difficult but necessary balance: respond rapidly and decisively in support of a few vital commitments while resisting the urge to endow lesser clashes with undue significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diagnosing-a-rivalry-lessons-and-insights-from-the-cold-war&quot;&gt;DIAGNOSING A RIVALRY: LESSONS AND INSIGHTS FROM THE COLD WAR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some critical ways, the emerging rivalry is unlike the Cold War. China is more of an aggrieved rising power determined to recapture its place in world politics than the Soviet Union was at the beginning of the Cold War. China’s economic and technological power is vastly greater, and it may turn out to be more pugnacious in crises — more self-righteous, more overconfident (partly out of a faith in its ability to control crises and limited wars in a mechanistic way), more anxious to use crises to teach punitive lessons, and less willing to negotiate or even communicate during a skirmish if it believes doing so would signal weakness. But there are enough areas of similarity between these two crisis-prone rivalries that the Cold War experience can offer relevant lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lesson-one-major-rivalries-are-systemic-contests&quot;&gt;LESSON ONE: MAJOR RIVALRIES ARE SYSTEMIC CONTESTS.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, the Cold War suggests that principles for managing confrontations should be grounded in a conception of the rivalry’s essential character. If it is a primarily military or imperial contest for strategic points, then the resolution of individual standoffs at such sites may be decisive. The Cold War, however, was not such a contest — it was a competition between systems and their domestic and international bases of power. The dominant center of gravity was domestic economic, social, technological, and cultural dynamism. Societal dynamism is the foundational measure of systemic competitiveness, and the Soviet system failed that test in the Cold War — it could not generate sufficient growth, innovation, or legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War systemic competition played out in international terms as well, in the struggle for leadership of international markets, institutions, and processes — the ability to set the rules of the international system and become the hub of predominant networks of finance, trade, people, and ideas. In such a systemic contest, power emerges from the production of legitimacy, economic power, and cultural influence that radiates outward and reshapes world politics. Any systemic contest is a struggle to be the dominant gravitational force in world politics. Here, too, the United States prevailed: the primary international institutions became increasingly oriented toward the United States and other leading democracies, which came to embody far greater magnetic power due to their economic dynamism, cultural attraction, military power, and broadly accepted legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the same themes can be detected in the current rivalry between the United States and China. It is certainly a contest of domestic systems: China’s economic dynamism, and the innovation and technological sophistication it has spawned, underlies its ability to challenge the United States. In global terms, China is seeking to gain influence in the United Nations and other international forums, weaken U.S.-led institutions, and build a set of Sino-centric ones, from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China is seeking dominance, and the ability to use others’ dependencies for leverage, in several high-technology sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theory of the nature of rivalries carries important lessons for the management of confrontations. Overreacting to individual encounters will usually be a mistake: a rivalry focused on long-term systemic attraction will not be determined by any one clash. In a contest powerfully influenced by attractive power and perceived legitimacy, over-aggressive and belligerent states will tend to undermine their long-term strategic position. They will also do so for classic reasons of strategic overreach: great powers that pour resources into distant clashes of secondary importance end up exhausting themselves and becoming strategically insolvent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the Cold War also suggests that gravitational effects and network power depend partly on perception and on others’ confidence in an actor’s power. Cultivating a reputation for strength and reliability is a systemic requirement every bit as important as avoiding overreach. Establishing guardrails on a rival’s progress, through a carefully selected set of inflexible commitments — in the case of the Cold War, the core U.S. alliances in Europe and Asia — can safeguard a baseline level of credibility. And it can provide running room to be more flexible on secondary issues without sparking a collapse of a great power’s global position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;overreacting-to-individual-encounters-will-usually-be-a-mistake-a-rivalry-focused-on-long-term-systemic-attraction-will-not-be-determined-by-any-one-clash&quot;&gt;Overreacting to individual encounters will usually be a mistake: a rivalry focused on long-term systemic attraction will not be determined by any one clash.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such flexibility is available because of a related lesson from the Cold War: while a reputation for credible commitments is important, reputation is a contingent factor — not every standoff carries the same reputational weight, and the lessons that friends and rivals take from individual crises will depend on many factors. Iain Henry has documented, for example, in the context of earlier Taiwan Strait crises, that U.S. allies sometimes prefer that the United States not fulfill other commitments if they do not directly enhance the ally’s security. Some U.S. allies and key regional states welcomed pre-Korean War U.S. statements that it would not defend Taiwan, fearing that to do so would drag them into conflict. More recent cases — such as Russia’s reaction to the U.S. failure to enforce a red line on chemical weapons use in Syria — reinforce the point that the credibility lessons others draw from U.S. actions are specific to each case. There is no imperative to show strength in every test of wills. An important lesson of the Cold War, then, is that even a bitter systemic rivalry is not a zero-sum affair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lesson-two-the-ambitions-of-a-great-power-are-a-work-in-progress&quot;&gt;LESSON TWO: THE AMBITIONS OF A GREAT POWER ARE A WORK IN PROGRESS.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War also suggests that any strategy for managing recurring confrontations should rely upon an accurate diagnosis of the rival’s intentions. A China on a global mission of military adventurism would demand a very different series of responses in discrete crises from a China in a defensive crouch, reacting to perceived attacks from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. strategy in the Cold War reflected in part an extended, imperfect effort to calculate the real intentions of Soviet leadership. Debates around such issues began with George Kennan’s “Long Telegram” and “X” article, which detected an urge to power in the Russian culture and Soviet system but also real risk aversion, and continued through the argument over the sincerity of reformers of the Gorbachev era. But in retrospect, perhaps the most important lesson was how inchoate Soviet ambitions were — grand and global in rhetorical content but mixed, often half-hearted, and contradictory in application. Far from being set in stone, Soviet intentions were a work in progress, an evolving set of ideas, commitments, and opportunistic grabs unfolding under nebulous long-term doctrines. A key lesson of the Cold War, then, is the potential gap between the ideological, rhetorical, and even strategic proclamations of a great power and its practical ability, or even at times desire, to pursue them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related lesson is that the Soviet intentions and actions, which unfolded during the Cold War, were reactive as much as self-generated. Soviet leaders occasionally glimpsed windows of opportunity based on perceived U.S. or Western weakness. More often, however, their ambitions were driven by concerns about what the United States was doing or might do, or about the dangerous potential of emerging trends. One does not have to fully embrace a comprehensive revisionist account of the Cold War to accept that in Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, Afghanistan in 1979, the Able Archer nuclear crisis of 1983 and many other cases, Moscow was acting out of reactive alarm rather than calculated revisionist ambitions. Even the Cuban Missile Crisis stemmed primarily from Khrushchev’s worries about a U.S. invasion of Cuba and an unfavorable nuclear balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of emergent rather than fixed national intentions has much in common with the portrait of Germany authored in 1907 by the British civil servant Eyre Crowe. It was obvious, Crowe wrote, that “Germany distinctly aims at playing on the world’s political stage a much larger and more dominant part than she finds allotted to herself under the present distribution of materiel power.” But the issue was whether this reflected a formally outlined agenda or a series of improvisations. It was entirely plausible, he argued, that “the great German design is in reality no more than the expression of a vague, confused, and unpractical statesmanship, not fully realizing its own drift” and that “Germany does not really know what she is driving at.” Crowe concluded that it did not matter much which interpretation was correct: a belligerent Germany fueled by an “erratic, domineering, and often frankly aggressive spirit” was moving in a direction perilous to British interests whether it had a strict plan or not. It had to be opposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, the Soviet Union’s ambitions in the Cold War reflected at least as much of an ongoing extemporization under imprecise long-term desires as any consistent long-term plan. This does not mean that the Soviet Union was not aggressive or goal-oriented: Vladislav Zubok has pushed back against excessively revisionist accounts of Soviet intentions, noting that ideology did fuel Soviet foreign policy and that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stalin’s policy was not one of confusion and defense, but one of cautious expansionism. Various factors intervened to prevent implementation of his policies, but historians should not overlook specific designs and intentions that produced those policies in the first place. Stalin was clever and scheming, and he regarded the Western powers as dangerous rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting Soviet objectives were in many ways inexact and conceptual, more of a work in progress than a preset plan. Any given Soviet lunge — backing Kim Il-sung’s invasion of South Korea, putting missiles into Cuba, or invading Hungary or Czechoslovakia — was more likely to be a momentary, unplanned scheme or reaction than a cog in an orchestrated machine of conquest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this emergent, improvisational character of goals and the lack of detailed information about others’ thinking, the Cold War and earlier great power rivalries show the great difficulty of gauging a rival’s true intentions. States uncertain of others’ goals then often engage in worst-case analysis and overreact to specific moves. In the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union frequently misread the true reasons behind specific actions and reacted based on often exaggerated beliefs about each other’s purposes. A classic example was the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan: the Carter administration saw it as the first step toward military control of the Persian Gulf, when in fact Soviet leaders were desperately trying to prevent the country from slipping out of the Soviet orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to believe that this basic model applies to China today; it is a state with elaborate goals, but ones without precise form and subject to misunderstanding. China’s international objectives are more of an improvisational work in progress in service of some clear but very broad long-term goals, rather than the working out of a rigid, pre-planned campaign. To be clear, this is not to suggest that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) lacks ambition: China aspires to modify and even partially dismantle the U.S.-led post-war order and achieve some version of global leadership and deference to its wishes, at least in its own region. Some degree of global control is inextricably linked to the CCP’s core ambition of national rejuvenation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s goals are therefore formidable and potentially dangerous to U.S. interests. The argument here is only that the detailed requirements for a world that would meet these goals are being worked out over time, and the strategies China uses to obtain them are also emerging through trial and error. Much like Germany in 1907 or the Soviet Union in 1946, China has a broad sense of a desired future — but the shape of its precise components, and what it is prepared to do to achieve them, remain very much a work in progress. And they will emerge through a long-term interaction with its primary perceived antagonist, the United States — not because the United States is responsible for all Chinese belligerence, but because Beijing will respond in part to perceived threats and to actions which appear intended to deny it the achievement of what it regards as legitimate interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is apparent from the phrases that Chinese officials and scholars have used to depict their goals, which are powerful but also vague and abstract. Statements such as “win-win cooperation” and “a community of common destiny” seem more like assertions of hope and general intent than a commitment to a specific agenda. Hal Brands and Michael Beckley argue that “China doesn’t want to be a superpower — one pole of many in the international system. It wants to be the superpower — the geopolitical sun around which the system revolves,” but even that potent objective could take many forms. They admit that its goals exist more in a “rough consensus” than any “detailed, step-by-step plans” and that it does not require “outright physical dominance” in the manner of some previous imperial powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most powerful recent case for an expansive view of China’s ambitions is Rush Doshi’s book The Long Game, which makes the argument that Chinese official sources suggest an almost unlimited thirst for regional hegemony and global predominance. Yet even in his extensive account, most of the phrases attributed to official documents are rather vague: “make new and greater contributions to humanity,” “actively accomplishing something,” “a new type of international relations,” a “community of common destiny,” and other fuzzy exhortations. More pointed and specific demands, such as the suggestion that U.S. alliances must be ruined, tend to come from individual scholars or breast-pounding statements from specific Chinese commentators. In fact, many Chinese sources explicitly reject such terms as “hegemony,” associating it with Western imperial ambitions and claiming China seeks something very different. Some explicitly accept the idea of sharing world power, as Doshi puts it at one point, as “co-equals” with the United States. As Paul Heer put it in a respectful but critical review of Doshi’s book: “What Doshi appears to be overlooking or dismissing here is the possibility that China seeks to escape subordination to the United States, but without presuming that it can, in turn, subordinate the United States: that it expects a central role in global leadership without presuming exclusive global hegemony.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other sources recognize the loose concepts and definitions inherent in Chinese strategic statements. One recent RAND study concluded that “no official Chinese document that outlines a strategy for managing competition with the United States is known to exist… At most, officials have described Chinese concepts, guiding principles, and proposals for foreign policy, all of which provide important clues as to Chinese intent.” Nadège Rolland argues that Beijing seems intent on some form of recognized primacy but explains that the precise elements of such a vision remain unformed and subject to debate. The vagueness, silence, and variety of opinions in Chinese thinking on strategic objectives suggest to Aaron Friedberg that “analysis of China’s long-term strategy cannot help but rest heavily on inference and speculation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friedberg is deeply concerned about expansive Chinese ambitions, but he too relies on generic terms to capture China’s intent — seeking “predominance,” “preponderance,” or “hegemony” — while admitting that its “precise definition, and the extent to which” these concepts “can be achieved at acceptable cost at any given moment, remain[s] open to discussion and debate.” At one point he suggests that a more emergent approach to objectives may reflect an essential characteristic of Chinese strategy. Whereas Western strategy tends to be goal-directed, Chinese thinking tends to be “more organic and improvisational and less mechanical and deterministic.” Friedberg also points out that different Chinese officials “may be divided, or even undecided,” about the shape of their objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese writings also admit constraints on the tools the country might use to gain its desired future. They emphasize avoidance of war with the United States as well as other limits, such as an emphasis on nonmilitary forms of power, and recognize “the importance of having a balanced and nuanced strategy that avoids disastrous missteps.” Chinese strategy recognizes that a stable international environment and a friendly regional environment are essential to national rejuvenation, and Chinese official and unofficial sources stress the need for international legitimacy as a supporting pillar for both domestic legitimacy and the kind of leading global role Beijing seeks — based on the open acceptance of Chinese authority as a force for good, not the grudging tolerance of a resented coercion. Some Chinese sources have described an “ideal security environment” in ways that do not appear to demand hegemony at all. Chinese sources dispute the question of whether the United States would accept subordination to a clearly superior China, and therefore whether China should seek such a future. China sees little need to impose its political system on other countries or to develop a global network of military bases. Most fundamentally, the CCP’s predominant goal is to maintain its own power, and risky international steps that could pose serious threats to its rule will usually trade off against this most essential of objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important place to judge the scope of Chinese ambitions as they play out in practice, as opposed to theory, is in its push-and-pull with specific targets of influence. South Korea provides an interesting recent example. When Seoul announced in 2016 an intention to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in cooperation with the United States, China reacted angrily, calling the capability a threat to its nuclear deterrent. When South Korea went ahead with an initial THAAD deployment in 2017, China imposed economic sanctions, which cost South Korea and estimated $8 billion or more. The Moon Jae-in administration in South Korea sought to proceed with a partial deployment while mollifying Beijing, offering a promise of “three nos”: Seoul promised not to deploy more than one THAAD system, not to actively join a U.S. missile defense network, and not to seek a trilateral military alliance with the United States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This result demonstrated some Chinese influence but not an ability to dictate outcomes: China backed off its sanctions even though the initial THAAD system remained in place. Since that time, China’s belligerence has had a significant price. Public opinion in South Korea turned starkly against China. The new president, Yoon Suk Yeol, has declared that the “three nos” do not represent permanent South Korean policy and describes the U.S. alliance as “fundamental” to South Korean security. Chinese diplomacy on this issue has been improvising in service of a general goal — and the outcome does not reflect a linear march toward the future of Chinese regional suzerainty described in the most aggressive statements of its scholars and officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More evidence for the emergent, unplanned nature of Chinese ambitions comes from studies of its primary tool for achieving hegemony — the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As analysts such as Raffaello Pantucci, Alexandros Petersen, Will Doig, and Jonathan Hillman have chronicled, to observe the working out of the BRI on the ground is to see a massive exercise in decentralized initiative and frequent ad-libbing. The overall enterprise does support a broad Chinese hope to play a leading role in world politics, and surely elements of it are planned from Beijing. But the empirical record of its unfolding suggests an accumulating set of emerging programs and ideas rather than a rigid and deterministic program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ambitions thus appear to reflect a typical degree of elaborate geopolitical self-image characteristic of rising great powers, infused with China’s particular blend of resentment over past mistreatment and sense of cultural superiority. The United States should not underestimate the intensity, reach, or emotional resonance of those ambitions. On the other hand, the precise scope of a world China could live with remains undefined. “The question of whether they will have to settle for something less than clear-cut preponderance is probably unresolved at this point in the minds of China’s leaders,” Aaron Friedberg concluded. Individual confrontations, much as in the Cold War, can represent many things: a carefully planned step toward regional hegemony, a defensive reaction to a perceived threat, a trial or experiment, or the initiative of one part of the CCP bureaucracy. And along the way, U.S. actions and responses to Chinese behavior will shape Beijing’s perceptions of the degree to which the United States is fundamentally opposed to its core interests, and the sort of world it believes is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lesson-three-there-is-wisdom-to-moderation-in-crises&quot;&gt;LESSON THREE: THERE IS WISDOM TO MODERATION IN CRISES.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War offers a final lesson in the handling of individual U.S.-China clashes. Despite the common idea that containment demanded an immediate answer to every Soviet and Chinese initiative, in fact, Washington succeeded in the Cold War in part precisely because it picked its spots. President Harry Truman rejected demands to escalate the Korean War and accepted an unsatisfying draw. Dwight Eisenhower refused French pleas to join the war in Indochina during the 1954 siege of Dien Bien Phu, rebuffed calls to intervene during Moscow’s invasion of Hungary in 1956, and sought to preserve U.S. geopolitical legitimacy by opposing British and French interventions in Suez that same year. The United States did not commit force to respond to Soviet interventions in Czechoslovakia in 1968 or Afghanistan in 1979. It accepted a communist takeover of Cuba and allowed an anti-American theocracy to take root in Iran. In some of these cases, of course, Washington turned to covert regime change operations to pursue its goals, but it avoided the use of force in the initial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That dismal parade of nonresponses would seem to be an obvious recipe for failure — allowing a rival to succeed, or accepting U.S. losses, in one crisis and war after another. Yet the United States prevailed because the rivalry ultimately represented a clash of systems, one decided first and foremost by the organic power of the relative societies. The United States did erect a strong floor under the day-to-day competition by committing resolutely to a handfulof treaty commitments and vital interests, notably the defense of Europe, South Korea, and Japan, which placed strict limits on how far Soviet or Chinese success in other crises would cascade. But it prevailed (and survived) as much due to restraint as to belligerence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weathering these collisions required something else as well: a mutual willingness to combine steadfastness with reassurance and compromise during even the worst crises. Both sides showed a recurring ability to respect the most essential interests of the other and to accept that avoiding escalation demanded conciliation. This was the pattern in U.S. restraint in Korea and Vietnam, in the series of crises over Berlin, in the Cuban Missile Crisis, and in many other cases. Managing confrontations was as much about empathy and compromise as it was about power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;yet-the-united-states-prevailed-because-the-rivalry-ultimately-represented-a-clash-of-systems-one-decided-f-irst-and-foremost-by-the-organic-power-of-the-relative-societies&quot;&gt;Yet the United States prevailed because the rivalry ultimately represented a clash of systems, one decided f irst and foremost by the organic power of the relative societies.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, U.S. appreciation for this fact was wildly inconsistent. All too often, U.S. officials misread individual confrontations as the result of Soviet aggressiveness and belligerence rather than fear and desperation. Some of the most dangerous moments in the Cold War flared up when one or both sides exaggerated the stakes of local disputes. This basic misperception cropped up again and again, from the Berlin crises to Afghanistan to perhaps the most famous and perilous example, the 1983 war scare produced by Soviet fears of an imminent U.S. nuclear strike. It was also a product of a related fact about Cold War clashes: despite immense intelligence apparatuses and decades-long personal ties, each side often had only the most rudimentary information about the other’s true thinking. Partly as a result, crisis signaling never worked as well in practice as in game theory. In the chaos of major clashes, signals were misinterpreted or ignored as often as accurately read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But U.S. moderation through many Cold War crises also suggests a more reassuring lesson: Soviet imperial objectives were to some degree self-correcting in the responses they provoked from others. Before 1950, for example, the United States was not fully committed to the defense of either South Korea or Taiwan. It was willing, for a time, to assume that Taiwan would be reabsorbed into the new mainland regime. But the Soviet-sponsored invasion of South Korea changed all that, sparking renewed U.S. and allied defense investments and commitments. The Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968 turned out to be strategically disastrous, alienating much of the nonaligned movement and speeding the collapse of domestic support for the Soviet system. The more belligerently aggressive Moscow became, the more it drove countries to seek implicit or explicit security help from the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is seeing much the same dynamic play out with China today. The more it seeks to intimidate its neighbors and capture influence within the societies of other countries, the more it steals intellectual property and imposes elaborate technology transfer demands on foreign firms, the more Beijing alienates those it is trying to win over. With Europe imposing much stricter controls on technology cooperation, Japan considering a doubling of its defense budget, and countries throughout Asia accelerating networks of security cooperation, China’s most aggressive ambitions may turn out to be, like the Soviet Union’s, a self-correcting threat. This has implications for its goals: China may seek regional hegemony, but if it encounters more visceral opposition with every new step, it will have to recalibrate its objectives over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;principles-for-managing-confrontations&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLES FOR MANAGING CONFRONTATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sources of insight lead back to the central goal of this essay — to nominate principles for managing an era of persistent altercations within a combative rivalry with China. The Cold War lessons summarized above can help inform these principles. Those lessons highlight the possibility of a rival whose ambitions are substantial but not clearly defined. They warn of the risks of misinterpreting China’s true motives in any crisis and suggest that a long-term systemic rivalry will not be determined by almost any one clash — but they also emphasize the need to draw some clear limits to an aggressive state’s opportunism. They make clear the need to balance strength in any one standoff with the need to remain patient, signal a willingness to compromise — if such a step remains possible in the context of U.S. China Policy — and avoid escalation. And the Cold War experience hints that China’s belligerence will be partly self-correcting and that successive crises can be one tool for shifting the global alignment of power against Beijing. Seven principles for managing confrontations embody these lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-one-establish-the-boundaries-of-us-tolerance&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE ONE: ESTABLISH THE BOUNDARIES OF U.S. TOLERANCE.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first principle requires identifying the potential confrontations that would justify strong and determined responses, with either military force or a comprehensive nonmilitary campaign of cost imposition. These are the confrontations in which the United States would draw red lines to circumscribe the outer bounds of China’s territorial encroachment, identifying those commitments and interests that will generate a rapid and substantial U.S. military response. Some U.S. experience with China indicates that China does respect firm boundaries when others draw them, suggesting that the strictest red lines would largely be respected (except for Taiwan, discussed below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 suggests a rough categorization of potential crises along two indices: (1) the degree of U.S. national interests involved, and (2) the precedential importance of an issue in regulating Chinese ambitions. Confrontations that reflect high measures on both indices (the top-right box) would call forth a powerful and direct response. An example would be a massed Chinese maritime coercion campaign to impose Japanese withdrawal from the Senkakus: such a gambit would demand rapid and substantial U.S. military deployments, reaffirmations that any action against Japan would trigger the U.S.-Japan security treaty, and other steps. Once it has identified the issues in this quadrant, the United States would then make unequivocal deterrent threats around them to avoid clashes in the first place. It has begun to do this with actions such as the statement that the Senkakus fall under the U.S.-Japan security treaty and the 2019 clarification that “any armed attack on Philippine forces, aircraft or public vessels in the South China Sea would trigger mutual defense obligations under Article IV of our Mutual Defense Treaty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the figure also highlights confrontations in which the United States would have more room for maneuver. The bottom-left corner includes issues that call for ongoing competition rather than risk-taking confrontations; when they flare into momentary public crises — such as the revelation of a specific Chinese human rights abuse or agreement to build a new military base — the United States could react calmly and indirectly. The most challenging quadrant to handle would be the bottom right: forms of Chinese coercion or outright aggression that threaten non-treaty allies, but which could, if successful, turbocharge Chinese ambitions. Here, the United States could potentially rally world opinion, support the beleaguered state in significant ways, or impose punishments on China, but not deploy forces or risk a direct confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/byDcnVA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Categorizing Potential Confrontations.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matrix does not distinguish crises based on who initiates confrontation, a crucial factor. The restrained U.S. approach in the recent Taiwan Strait Crisis was probably dictated in part by the role of U.S. actions in creating it. Whether a given crisis arises from U.S. or allied actions, or fully unprovoked Chinese belligerence, will have to be considered when categorizing a given confrontation and the appropriate responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue is notably absent from the figure — Taiwan. Much of the debate about U.S. policy really amounts to which cell it belongs in. Many would place it on the right-hand side, as a precedent-setting issue for Chinese ambitions — though some would disagree, suggesting that it is such a unique issue that it holds limited meaning for restraining wider Chinese ambitions. Most of the debate, though, will be about the lower-right versus upper-right cells. Is this an issue that, when crises erupt, the United States should signal a strong and immediate response, including military deployments and threats of escalation? This question is addressed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-two-emphasize-understanding-and-strategic-empathy&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE TWO: EMPHASIZE UNDERSTANDING AND STRATEGIC EMPATHY.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major theme of Cold War crises was how often each side misread the intentions of its rival — and how dangerous such misperceptions could be. In the current rivalry, these risks may be compounded by China’s doctrinal emphasis on moving rapidly, decisively, and violently at the beginning of a crisis or war to seize the strategic advantage. China’s own myopic conviction that its ambitions reflect a rightful demand for fair treatment may make it blind to the ways in which it generates crises, something the United States needs to understand and navigate around. In recent crises, U.S. signals of toughness, based on limited information about Chinese intentions, have arguably created unnecessary risk. And the history of Chinese crisis behavior suggests that, like most great powers, it is most likely to take risk and escalate events when it perceives itself in a domain of losses, under severe pressure, and losing strategic position and credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will therefore be essential for senior U.S. officials to put in place wide-ranging sources of information, from inside as well as outside government, and formal analytical products that constantly invite them to put themselves into the mindset of leaders in Beijing. This is easier said than done, and the hints of a new orthodoxy on China are already evident that will make it even tougher. It will demand committed effort from presidents and senior advisers to be sure they are drawing from the widest possible basis of information and interpretations — offices, products, and processes that go well beyond reporting on China to representing its mindset, as well as relationships between U.S. and Chinese officials that provide some basis for correcting misimpressions during future crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-three-keep-from-generating-crises-ourselves-especially-with-unnecessary-political-provocations&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE THREE: KEEP FROM GENERATING CRISES OURSELVES, ESPECIALLY WITH UNNECESSARY POLITICAL PROVOCATIONS.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be times when the United States believes it needs to take strong action on some issue in the relationship, actions China will view unfavorably. But Washington should avoid provoking unnecessary confrontations to the greatest degree possible. Partly this is simple resource management: Expending time, diplomatic capital, and military readiness on needless clashes is not good strategy. This imperative is partly about managing Chinese perceptions, avoiding, to the degree still possible (which may be limited), the idea that the United States is determined to challenge China in every opportunity. But it is also partly about sending a signal to third parties that both sides in this rivalry are not equally responsible for its most dangerous moments — that the United States, to the degree possible, seeks stability and China is the author of instability. All of those principles help to set the context for the successful resolution of individual confrontations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the challenge for the United States is to avoid the central source of instability when dealing with rising, dissatisfied powers — signaling that the only way for them to achieve their rightful place in world politics is through warfare. Accommodating some Chinese aims and ambitions is not only appropriate, it is essential if we are to avoid a bitterly zero-sum contest with an aggrieved and increasingly paranoid great power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-four-develop-options-for-shoring-up-credibility-away-from-the-local-confrontation&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE FOUR: DEVELOP OPTIONS FOR SHORING UP CREDIBILITY AWAY FROM THE LOCAL CONFRONTATION.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any significant clash will raise the age-old issue of credibility and reputation, sparked by fears about the lessons that third parties will draw from U.S. conduct in such standoffs as well as concerns about domestic political costs of inaction. As noted, this concern for reputation can sometimes push great powers to take risks beyond those the interests at stake would seem to support. To avoid being trapped into excessive reactions out of a concern for credibility, the United States should identify indirect ways to shore it up — actions away from the local confrontation that signal U.S. strength and commitment without undertaking costly adventures. Partly this can involve preset options to quietly reset expectations in the wake of crises, including enhanced U.S. military posture, public statements of commitment to friends and allies, arms aid and transfers to partners, and expanded security cooperation activities. It can energize dialogues with U.S. friends and allies on shared steps to bolster collective credibility when a local military response is not judged to be sensible. None of this would involve starting new proxy conflicts or putting U.S. credibility on the line in new places or conflicts. The options would focus on reinforcing existing alliances and commitments to make clear that restraint in one confrontation will not produce a domino effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-five-multilateralize-confrontations&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE FIVE: MULTILATERALIZE CONFRONTATIONS.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has the great advantage of enjoying the active or tacit support of most key industrial powers, and most countries in Asia, in the effort to constrain the most aggressive forms of Chinese power. Both before and during crises, the United States should continue to seek to recruit collective support for norms and principles; then, when China prompts a clash with belligerent actions, it will face significant global criticism and confront a strong coalition of states insisting that it respect certain norms of conduct. One example is the growing European presence in Asia, in particular, conducting various forms of freedom of navigation demonstrations and security engagements with Asian nations. There is an ample institutional framework for such an effort, starting with the United Nations and running through bilateral and multilateral alliances, minilateral groupings such as the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) initiative, informal groups such as the Quad, and regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The United States will have uneven success in recruiting support in these venues depending on the nature of the crisis, but a major focus now can be to build a strong normative foundation for later support in crises. It would accelerate efforts to ensure that, especially in crises involving true U.S. red lines, China would confront a substantial coalition opposing its belligerence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-six-use-confrontations-as-levers-to-seek-competitive-advantage&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE SIX: USE CONFRONTATIONS AS LEVERS TO SEEK COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should seek with every event not merely to fulfill its immediate interests but to rally world opinion against Chinese coercive provocations and put into place a gradually increasing deterrent posture in the region. After each crisis, for example, the United States can approach key regional actors, such as the Philippines, and propose slightly improved U.S. force presence and deepened bilateral training and exercise activities. It can try to ensure that each confrontation has some of the echo effect of major Soviet adventures in the Cold War, from Korea to Czechoslovakia to Afghanistan, in stiffening the commitment of other states to respond to the next provocation. To do this, however, the United States will need far better tools of informational statecraft to help shape opinions, especially in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reap such competitive benefits, the United States should develop concepts and capabilities to ensure that, once a confrontation is underway, the passage of time benefits the United States rather than China. Whether it is a maritime standoff over a set of disputed islands, a partial or complete quarantine of Taiwan, or another clash with the potential to last days, weeks, or even months, the side that accumulates more strength over time will have the advantage. If China believes it can outlast the United States, it will have every incentive to disregard short-term challenges and hold out to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;principle-seven-use-each-confrontation-as-an-opportunity-to-build-communication-channels-rules-of-engagement-and-norms-of-conduct&quot;&gt;PRINCIPLE SEVEN: USE EACH CONFRONTATION AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD COMMUNICATION CHANNELS, RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, AND NORMS OF CONDUCT.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War also highlights the role of mutual understandings in helping to manage the pressure-packed days or weeks of individual crises. A great risk with China today is that the formal crisis management mechanisms that do exist are embryonic, frequently ignored or bypassed, and not developed through mutual practice. Personal relationships between U.S. and Chinese officials are either nonexistent or, with a few exceptions, poorly developed. In some past crises, the absence of rapid U.S. responses to Chinese signals was potentially dangerous. In the wake of every crisis, the United States could approach China with an offer to jointly learn lessons and find ways of avoiding inadvertent escalation in future clashes, including through codified rules of engagement, mechanisms of communication, and informal standards of conduct. This is especially true at senior levels: Chinese habits of centralized decisionmaking and constraints on regular contacts at many levels may leave little room for strengthening rules of engagement from the bottom up. Senior U.S. officials and U.S. presidents should therefore use the aftermath of any crisis as an opportunity to argue for processes and contacts that improve mutual understanding, and mechanisms for easy conversation, at their level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;a-great-risk-with-china-today-is-that-the-formal-crisis-management-mechanisms-that-do-exist-are-embryonic-frequently-ignored-or-bypassed-and-not-developed-through-mutual-practice&quot;&gt;A great risk with China today is that the formal crisis management mechanisms that do exist are embryonic, frequently ignored or bypassed, and not developed through mutual practice.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-does-this-leave-taiwan&quot;&gt;WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE TAIWAN?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those principles may work reasonably well for most U.S.-China confrontations, but they may be of less use on the dispute most likely to spark crises: the status of Taiwan. The issue resides in a vague middle ground between the two right-hand cells in Figure 1 — possibly, but not necessarily, justifying inclusion with the clashes that would prompt an immediate and uncompromising U.S. response to Chinese coercive modes. That obscure status is becoming ever more complex and strewn with dilemmas. On the one hand, the case for the U.S. policy of ambiguity remains strong: to promise unqualified defense of the island would provoke China and possibly tempt Taiwan to take actions which would irretrievably inflame the issue. Signaling restraint to extend China’s timeline for achieving its interests, in part by “keeping the possibility of peaceful unification alive” to the degree possible, has been an essential component of maintaining peace. This has meant avoiding symbolic actions that will infuriate Beijing and doing everything possible to reintroduce a degree of patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustaining that approach is critical and should be a U.S. policy priority. Yet it cannot be denied that all trends are now running in the direction of more formal U.S. commitments to defend Taiwan. Having watched the horrors of the Ukraine war unfold, the United States may now be far less likely to exercise similar restraint over Taiwan. President Biden has said multiple times that the United States would defend Taiwan, only to have his words walked back. The most recent of these statements implied the United States would fight even if Taiwan declared independence, a clear shift from existing policy. Meanwhile, Congress seems on the verge of passing a Taiwan Policy Act that would represent nothing short of a revolution in U.S. security relations with Taipei. There may now be no going back to the precise forms of mutual restraint around the Taiwan issue that helped produce relative stability for the last 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of dealing with confrontations over Taiwan is further complicated by the fact that they may not represent an outright invasion. More likely is an interim series of crises below that threshold, intended to signal China’s determination and warn the United States, Taiwan, and others off any course that hints at de facto independence. Such moves could include repeated exercises, penetration of Taiwanese airspace, cyberattacks on Taiwan’s civilian and military infrastructure, large-scale political warfare, direct attacks on islands in the strait, attacks on undersea cables carrying internet connectivity to the island, temporary or quasi-permanent blockades of parts of the surrounding waterways, or an energy embargo. Even if Beijing does move toward a full invasion, it would have to undertake many forms of preparation — from months or years of surging defense production to national mobilization to more immediate movement of forces — that would create a crisis of impending war long before the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be no simple playbook for U.S. responses to such a diverse array of actions, but the principles for managing persistent confrontations suggested above can still provide some guidance. First, the essential foundation for any U.S. approach to future crises should begin with an effort to reaffirm elements of stability to reset the context for future confrontations. If China comes to believe that the United States is inching toward open support for Taiwanese independence, it will have less incentive to restrain the escalatory dynamics of any crisis. It may be too late to resuscitate the comprehensive policy of ambiguity, but Washington can still offer a modified reassurance to Beijing. It can pledge that the One China Policy remains in place, indicate that the United States has no intention to formally recognize an independent Taiwan, and insist that both sides restrain actions that could lead to war. Washington could even publicly signal that a Taiwanese declaration of independence would void any U.S. promises. (In fact the 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy came fairly close to saying all of this.) In return it should request more consistent pledges from Beijing that it remains committed to the peaceful resolution of the issue, as it has long claimed. A mutually agreed series of such statements could move the public position of both sides back from the brink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, however, and in tension with that effort, the United States now seems compelled to clarify its red lines for future Taiwan crises in ways more explicit than the policy of ambiguity had allowed. It could declare that an unprovoked Chinese attack on Taiwan proper would produce U.S. military involvement of some kind, leaving substantial leeway in terms of what military response it would undertake. It could continue to insist on freedom of navigation in international waters — including international maritime freedom to engage with Taiwan (thus placing a comprehensive Chinese blockade across the U.S. threshold of tolerance). This would amount to placing only the most severe confrontations in the upper-right quadrant of Figure 1, actions that would trigger a U.S. military response in a crisis (such as large-scale military movements). Lesser contingencies — including Chinese cyberattacks, missile flights, violations of Taiwan’s airspace, and even direct attacks on small islands in the strait — would fall into the lower-right quadrant and leave the United States with greater freedom of action in responding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under such an approach, the United States would not reflexively seek to confront any Chinese coercive act around Taiwan. It would not adopt a policy of disrupting any Chinese exercises, flights, or sailings that cross certain territorial lines, unless they dealt with red-line issues. As in the recent strait crisis, it would take a largely hands-off approach unless there were clear actions or indications that China was preparing to violate one of the red-line issues. The approach aims to recreate, in miniature, the essential U.S. approach during the Cold War, combining firm commitment to a small number of essential red lines with flexibility on most other clashes. The result would split the difference on ambiguity, but in ways that do not reflect a major departure from U.S. policy, which has always insisted on a peaceful resolution of the issue and strongly hinted that the United States would respond militarily to an outright invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, before or during a major crisis, the United States could follow other elements of the principles for managing confrontations suggested above. It could recruit statements from other countries insisting that China not use military force as well as expand multilateral exercises, sailings, and security cooperation efforts to make clear that an unprovoked use of force would put Beijing afoul of most of the world economy. For lesser contingencies where it chooses restraint, such as the recent crisis, the United States could undertake parallel actions to demonstrate strength, reassure regional actors, and reaffirm its credibility. It could finally get serious about its information instrument of statecraft and use Chinese belligerence to drive regional and global opinion during future skirmishes. At the same time, it would do everything possible to enhance channels of communication and personal relationships and approach Beijing after each clash to reaffirm key rules of the road. Fourth and finally, this approach has implications for U.S. operational military posture in the region. A relatively calm and contained approach to many confrontations will have much greater credibility if the United States and Taiwan have a stronger persistent, preset ability to impose costs on aggression, rather than having to spend weeks or months flowing forces to the area. This demands, first and foremost, that Taiwan take stronger steps for its own defense. More spending, a true commitment to a more asymmetric emphasis, and a transformation of Taiwan’s reserve forces are minimum necessary steps. For the United States, this approach would call for more submarines; unmanned undersea systems; advanced sensing and targeting systems, including long-range drones; loitering munitions; some number of long-range precision fire systems (including bombers); and demonstrated offensive cyber capabilities. The United States would also need to design the highest-impact forces to be able to rapidly deploy to the region — even onto Taiwan — once it received unambiguous warning that China was assembling forces for a full, unprovoked invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-temperate-strategy-for-managing-confrontations&quot;&gt;TOWARD A TEMPERATE STRATEGY FOR MANAGING CONFRONTATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conceptualizing the emerging U.S.-China rivalry, most U.S. officials and analysts have become accustomed to thinking of the competition as a persistent contest to shape measures of advantage on some grand long-term scorecard. But an equally important set of choices will be episodic — the ways the United States approaches specific crises and confrontations to gain strategic advantage while avoiding conflict. It needs a strategy for managing such clashes as much as it requires a general approach to national competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Cold War offers a blueprint for such a strategy, it suggests that a great power must first get its fundamental socioeconomic engine right and work to set the alignment of world politics to its advantage. To limit the cascading effect of any one loss or compromise, it must lay out a handful of vital commitments on which its commitments are resolute and credible. The U.S. experience with China in recent decades suggests that such explicit line-drawing on the most important issues can have a meaningful effect on Chinese behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;but-an-equally-important-set-of-choices-will-be-episodic--the-ways-the-united-states-approaches-specif-ic-crises-and-confrontations-to-gain-strategic-advantage-while-avoiding-conflict-it-needs-a-strategy-for-managing-such-clashes-as-much-as-it-requires-a-general-approach-to-national-competitive-advantage&quot;&gt;But an equally important set of choices will be episodic — the ways the United States approaches specif ic crises and confrontations to gain strategic advantage while avoiding conflict. It needs a strategy for managing such clashes as much as it requires a general approach to national competitive advantage.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having done these things, great powers can then be restrained in most individual crises beyond those issues or allies because they are not going to decide the outcome. Repeatedly in the Cold War, the United States responded to clashes with at least a degree of restraint — in Korea, Dien Bien Phu, Hungary, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. There is every reason to believe the same basic rule will hold in the rivalry with China: the United States cannot be so spring-loaded to respond that it turns every clash into an existential contest of wills. This suggests, on Taiwan and other issues, a challenging but manageable balancing act that combines strengthening the most essential commitments with a determination not to overreact to other issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One risk, at this point, is that the room in the U.S. national security context for compromise, understanding, and sensible accommodation appears to be narrowing rapidly. Especially with the recent announcement of understandable constraints on dealing with China’s semiconductor industry, the United States is giving every indication of viewing the rivalry in increasingly zero-sum terms. This will convince Chinese officials and commentators that their most pessimistic instincts have been correct: the United States has no intention of offering shared leadership of world politics. The policy case for each of these specific actions, such as information technology constraints or arms sales to Taiwan, may be compelling. But the sum of these actions is creating an environment in which Beijing has much less incentive to hold back when a crisis arrives because it thinks its rival is operating according to a zero-sum mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;there-is-every-reason-to-believe-the-same-basic-rule-will-hold-in-the-rivalry-with-china-the-united-states-cannot-be-so-spring-loaded-to-respond-that-it-turns-every-clash-into-an-existential-contest-of-wills&quot;&gt;There is every reason to believe the same basic rule will hold in the rivalry with China: the United States cannot be so spring-loaded to respond that it turns every clash into an existential contest of wills.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessica Chen Weiss recently made an impassioned plea for strategic goals and direction in a U.S. China Policy rapidly being swallowed up by worst-case assumptions and zero-sum thinking. “U.S. politicians and policymakers are becoming so focused on countering China that they risk losing sight of the affirmative interests and values that should underpin U.S. strategy,” she argues. U.S. policy “has struggled to define success” in the overall competition and has become dangerously reactive and, at times, exaggerated. As a result, “Both countries are intent on doing whatever is necessary to demonstrate that any move by the other will not go unmet.” The same dynamic could easily come to characterize the U.S. approach to specific crises. In its approach to the periodic clashes that will increasingly come to characterize this relationship, no less than in the overarching rivalry, the United States needs a positive strategy for success.&lt;/p&gt;

What is far less obvious is the level of confrontation between the U.S. and its strategic partners with both Russia and China, the rising levels of other types of violence emerging on a global level, how serious these wars and crises can become, and what kind of future could eventually emerge out of so many different crises, confrontations and conflicts, and trends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis explores the risk on the basis that war does not have to mean actual military conflict. Here, it is important to note that avoiding or minimizing combat is scarcely peace. As Sun Tzu pointed out in the Art of War well over 2,000 years ago, “war” does not have to involve the use of military force or any form of actual combat. His statement that “the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting” applies to every form of major military confrontation and gray area warfare between opposing powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It recognizes that it is all too easy to predict dire outcomes from the War in Ukraine, the current arms races with Russia and China, and growing levels of violence and confrontation between other states. There is still a case, however, for examining the broader impact of the war, the growing intensity of the arms races with Russia and China, and the current overall patterns of global conflict as the world enters the winter of 2022-2023. It is already clear that this will be a deeply troubled winter in many areas of the globe, that the level of confrontation between major powers has risen sharply, that they do seek to subdue the enemy without fighting, and their rivalry has become the equivalent of political and economic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is equally clear that the wide range of lower-level conflicts between other powers, their civil wars, and the abuses many governments commit against their own citizens are also intensifying, although many of these conflicts have been going on in some form for years or even decades. In far too many cases, the world is not moving toward peace. It is moving towards repression and war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, this analysis argues that the world already faces a series of possible and ongoing “Winter Wars” in 2022-2023 that may not escalate to open military conflict but that are wars at the political and economic level and in competition to build-up more lethal military forces both for deterrence and to exert political leverage. It also shows that these “Wars” already pose serious risks and could escalate sharply and in unpredictable ways for at least the next five to ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global list of wars that are ongoing in the winter of 2020-2023, and that seems likely to continue to affect global security in the future, that this study examines includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “Winter War” in Gray Area, Spoiler, and Proxy Warfare&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “Winter War” in Fragile, Divided, Authoritarian, and Undeveloped States&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis warns that the world is not moving towards peace, that new forms of Cold War divide all the world’s major powers, and that far too few smaller states have solid levels of development, effective governance, and are moving toward peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least one war has already escalated into a major conflict, and that involves fighting between Ukraine and Russia that seems almost certain to continue to escalate through the winter of 2022-2023. The Russian invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022 began with what appeared to be a Russian effort to seize the entirety of Ukraine, became a war of attrition on the ground, and has now escalated to a strategic level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine, however, has had sufficient support from the West and other states to be able to defend against Russia to the point where it has forced Russia to mobilize. The U.S. alone has provided some $60 billion in arms, economic aid, and other support by early October 2022, and is fighting the equivalent of a proxy war against Russia. Britain, the EU, and several other strategic partners have been providing major aid to Ukraine as well, and while Russia may have tried mobilizing up to 300,000 troops in October, it had also mobilized a substantial part of the developed world against it in ways where their aid to Ukraine did far more to challenge Russia than any aspects of their normal defense spending and modernization of their forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tying-combat-to-attacks-on-ukrainian-civil-targets&quot;&gt;Tying Combat to Attacks on Ukrainian Civil Targets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and other supporters of Ukraine have waged an economic war of sanctions, and trade controls on Russia, as well as have provided economic and military aid to Ukraine, but Russia has responded more effectively in other ways with a combination of military escalation and an economic war over energy exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has escalated to conducting military attacks on Ukraine’s population and economic and military warfare against its infrastructure. Russia has adapted its past reliance on “General Winter” and “General Mud” to try to destroy Ukraine’s economy and its ability to resist. The War in Ukraine has escalated from fighting a land/air/missile battle for the control of the Eastern Ukraine to a Russian strategy designed to destroy enough of the Ukrainian economy and infrastructure to force the Ukrainian government to end the fighting in ways that leave Russia with significant territorial gains, and Ukraine with a crippled economy that will take years to repair and with an uncertain future political and economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of the expansion of Russian attacks to civil and critical infrastructure targets has already reached critical levels by the end of October 2022 and has briefly shut off the flow of water and electric power to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in early November. The Ukrainian government reported then that strikes on key electricity generating targets in Ukraine had destroyed almost a third of its electric and other power generating facilities and left at least 1.5 million Ukrainians without power. They deprived Kyiv of safe drinking water for at least several days. Ukraine may be able to repair part of its infrastructure and deploy more effective and air defenses in the months to come but this is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Russia military attacks interacted with broader forms of economic warfare in Ukraine. They include attacks on Ukrainian grain exports and other targets that affect the entire Ukrainian economy. They have already levels of inflation that have reduced many Ukrainians to the poverty level and sharply increased Ukraine’s needs for economic aid as well as created a legacy that will require a massive post-war recovery program. Unless the Russian attacks halt or Ukraine is given a much larger set of missile and air defenses, they will create steadily growing problems in maintaining a decent life as winter progresses – often increasing poverty to the point where hard choices have to be made between “heat” and “eat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While accurate cost and supply data are lacking, Russia’s purchase of low-cost precision-guided conventionally armed missiles and drones from Iran may allow Russia to both destroy such Ukrainian economic targets and to saturate the more advanced air/missile defense systems the U.S. is providing to Ukraine – systems which will only provide limited area coverage for much of the winter, and whose operation is substantially more costly than Russia’s missile strike forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such attacks may cumulatively limit internal Ukrainian popular support for the war, and sharply reduce Russian casualties and embarrassing military defeats. At a minimum, the new Russian tactics and missile strikes will extend the length and intensity of the fighting, sharply raise its cost of military and civil aid and the cost of any postwar recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They may well force Ukraine to compromise on a settlement or to fight a debilitating war indefinitely into the future and show NATO European states – especially those near the Russian border – that Russia still presents a major threat them regardless of the problems the fighting has revealed in its land forces. They also seem likely to make Russia steadily more reliant on such tactics in the future, and to continue to link the use of such missile and air attacks to the threat of escalating to theater nuclear warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-realities-versus-the-laws-of-war&quot;&gt;Russian Realities Versus the Laws of War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From another perspective, such Russian attacks provide all too clear a demonstration of the fact that future combat is likely to involve more intense and deliberate attacks on civilian targets in spite of the “laws” of war. The war in Ukraine is also scarcely unique. Virtually all recent lower-level conflicts have involved attacks on civil targets – often by terrorists or in internal civil conflicts, but also by states against states, regimes against parts of their own, or the factions in civil conflicts. With few exceptions, is also clear that the laws of war are unenforceable. Even most of the cases where the attackers lost the war did not result in any special punishment, and little real-world effort has been made to find more effective deterrents to such strikes on civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is striking that Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu openly stated on November 1st, 2022, that Russia was deliberately targeting the Ukraine’s critical civilian infrastructure in a legitimate effort to reduce the country’s military capacity. He stated that, “With precision-guided strikes, we continue to effectively hit military infrastructure facilities, as well as facilities that affect the reduction of Ukraine’s military potential.” The most Shoigu did to imply any restraint was to state that, “Comprehensive measures are being taken to prevent the death of Ukrainian citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key legacy of the war in Ukraine from the fighting of 2022/2023 may well be that it demonstrates that relying on unenforceable laws of war to provide real-world security for civilians may sometimes have worse consequences for the civilians involved than having no laws at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also a grim reality of modern warfare that other recent conflicts have shown almost any war fought in populated areas or cities involving key lines of communication or involving the use of artillery near population centers and critical infrastructure, will produce serious civilian casualties and amounts of damage to civilian facilities. The same is likely to be true of conflicts against terrorists, extremists, and any other faction that shelters in populated areas and use civilians as some form of shield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-between-the-west-politics-and-energy&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” between the West Politics, and Energy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It currently seems doubtful that any resolution of the war in Ukraine will produce any stable form of peace or fail to lead to enduring confrontation and between Russia and the West and a continuing risk of new forms of active conflict. The current confrontation has already escalated to the level of political and economic warfare and may well be followed by a struggle to modernize and reshape the military forces on each side that has both conventional and nuclear dimensions and gray area clashes and spoiler operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;war-without-combat&quot;&gt;War Without Combat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, it is important to note that avoiding or minimizing combat is scarcely peace. Russia and the West, are clearly seeking to “subdue the enemy without fighting.” The same is true of the current relations between the U.S. and its strategic partners and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, many “winter wars” are being fought on a political, economic, and ideological level – and by building up national military forces in ways that give them enough strategic leverage to force the opposing side to meet its opponents’ strategic goals without direct combat between them. The versions of these wars between are also generally being fought to change the political and economic behavior of other states rather than conquer them, to keep them from intimidating or forcing given patterns of action on other states, or to make them conform to international standards that are cooperative in nature. As such, some have a massive grand strategic impact on the world even though they are being fought without combat and an effort seeking to dominate or conquer the opponent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other such wars are far more limited. For example, proxy wars can be fought in ways that involve indirect combat. Examples are proxy wars like the West’s military aid to Ukraine, and Russia’s use of mercenaries in Libya and “advisors” in Syria. More generally, they can be fought in the form of spoiler operations that push other parties into fighting, in the form of deployments and exercises that act as military threats, and by using military forces passively to exert political leverage and influence. In practice, military deterrence is simply another a form of warfare: it too exploits the competitive use of military forces to achieve as strategic objective without fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is reflected in the fact that the war in Ukraine has created broad political and economic conflicts between Russia and much of the West. Both sides have steadily escalated their political and economic conflict since the start of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. Putin has responded by mobilizing Russia, carrying out a major political campaign against the West, denouncing the U.S. and other states for supporting Ukraine, and accusing the United States and other Western powers of seeking to dominate Europe and isolate and dismember Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West has responded by building up its military presence in the forward areas of NATO, denouncing Putin, seeking support from the UN in criticizing the Russian attack and conduct of a war in Ukraine with steadily increasing civilian casualties and damage. The West not only is fighting a proxy war against Russia, but it has also launched the equivalent of economic war against Russia, which included halting gas and other imports from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S., Canada, European NATO and EU states, and many other states are now providing arms transfers, security assistance, financial aid, and economic aid to Ukraine while simultaneously waging economic and political war directly against Russia. And, as noted previously, Russia is replying in kind. This form of economic and political warfare, and competing major military build-ups, seems certain to escalate steadily throughout the winter and may well continue for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-broader-forms-of-economic-and-political-warfare&quot;&gt;The Broader Forms of Economic and Political Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither Russia nor the West are currently winning the economic and political side of the Ukraine War, nor seem likely to emerge as the winner in the near future. On the one hand, it is all too clear that Putin sharply underestimated the economic and political reaction of Western and many other states prior to his invasion of the Ukraine. There is no doubt that the Russian people have suffered deeply from Western reactions and sanctions. As yet, however, there has been only limited Russian popular resistance to the war, and Putin has escalated his war fighting efforts in spite of Western political and economic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the West has miscalculated as well. It began to implement major economic and political sanctions against Russia immediately after its invasion of the Ukraine. However, Western planners seem to have sharply underestimated Russia’s ability to survive them. They did not foresee the sustained and escalating impact Russia’s reactions would have on European and other energy supplies, on global food exports, on global political divisions, and on Russia’s actual military behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of November 2022, the economic and political side of this war has escalated to the point where the West keeps adding sanctions and trade and investment barriers, including controls over the critical technologies, components, and materials similar to the war of sanctions against Iran and North Korea. Russia has replied in kind by using its gas exports to sustain its economy, and its ability to limit Ukrainian grain and other food exports by sea – measures that have sharply increased the cost of food to many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, Figure One shows that Russia has actually increased its exports to a number of countries that support Ukraine and has not suffered nearly as much as some planners initially estimated in developing sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/j3JzRDK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-energy-war-as-an-indicator-of-the-seriousness-of-economic-warfare&quot;&gt;The Energy War as an Indicator of the Seriousness of Economic Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trade war and political and economic sanctions are only a part of this story. Figure Two shows that Russia has successfully retaliated against NATO and the other outside powers supporting Ukraine by conducting an energy war that has done critical damage to many Western economies. This energy war has interacted with impact of COVID and other Western economic problems that COVID helped create. The end result is that the West may have suffered as much as Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Russia has had some success in working with OPEC – and states as divided as Iran and Saudi Arabia – to place limits on global exports that help support its position. This has helped raise energy prices in virtually every Western and energy importing state and has succeeded in creating a level of inflation and other economic damage to the West which is roughly equivalent to the damage the West has done to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy war has also had many negative impacts on the rest of the world. It has again interacted with the impact of COVID, an uncertain global financial situation, and the damage done by global climate change. It has helped create a broader global crisis in food supplies, the rising levels of international poverty now reported by the UN and World Bank, and internal and local wars on a global basis. It is all too clear from this aspect of the War in Ukraine that there is no global “village,” but there clearly is “globalism” in the form of vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no clear way to predict the future impacts of this energy warfare during the winter of 2022-2023, or how it may develop in the months and years that will follow. However, the war’s impact on Russian energy exports and the global cost of oil and gas has already been critical and may lead to major strategic changes in the flow of energy exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned in the annual World Energy Outlook for October 2022 that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The world is in the middle of a global energy crisis of unprecedented depth and complexity. Europe is at the center of this crisis, but it is having major implications for markets, policies and economies worldwide. As so often is the case, the poorest and most vulnerable are likely to suffer most. The strains did not begin with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but they have been sharply exacerbated by it. Extraordinarily high prices are sparking a reappraisal of energy policies and priorities. The Europe-Russia energy relationship lies in tatters, calling into question the viability of decades of fossil fuel infrastructure and investment decisions built on this foundation. A profound reorientation of international energy trade is underway, bringing new market risks even as it addresses longstanding vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many of the contours of this new world are not yet fully defined, but there is no going back to the way things were. And we know from past energy crises that the process of adjustment is unlikely to be a smooth one. That adjustment will also be taking place in the context of commitments made by governments to clean energy transitions. A central theme of this World Energy Outlook 2022 is how the levers of technological change and innovation, trade and investment and behavioral shifts might drive a secure transition towards a net zero emissions energy system, while minimizing the potential risks and trade-offs between various policy objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s energy crisis shares some parallels with the 1970s oil price shocks, but there are also important differences. The crises in the 1970s were concentrated in oil markets and the global economy was much more dependent on oil than it is today. However, the intensity of use of other fossil fuels has not declined to the same extent; for natural gas it has risen in many cases. The global nature of the current crisis, its spread across all fossil fuels and the knock-on effects on electricity prices are all warning signs of broader economic impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The global energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is having far-reaching implications for households, businesses and entire economies, prompting short-term responses from governments as well as a deeper debate about the ways to reduce the risk of future disruptions and promote energy security. This is a global crisis, but Europe is the main theatre in which it is playing out, and natural gas is center stage – especially during the coming northern hemisphere winter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High energy prices are causing a huge transfer of wealth from consumers to producers, back to the levels seen in 2014 for oil, but entirely unprecedented for natural gas. High fuel prices account for 90% of the rise in the average costs of electricity generation worldwide, natural gas alone for more than 50%. The costs of renewables and carbon dioxide have played only a marginal role, underscoring that this is a crisis where energy transitions are the solution, rather than the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Price and economic pressures mean that the number of people without access to modern energy is rising for the first time in a decade. Around 75 million people who recently gained access to electricity are likely to lose the ability to pay for it, and 100 million people may revert to the use of traditional biomass for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There remain huge uncertainties over how this energy crisis will evolve and for how long fossil fuel prices will remain elevated, and the risks of further energy disruption and geopolitical fragmentation are high. In all our scenarios, price pressures and a dim near-term outlook for the global economy feed through into lower energy demand than in last year’s Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the loss of its largest export market in Europe, Russia faces the prospect of a much-diminished role in international energy affairs. 2021 proves to be a high-water mark for Russian export flows. Its share of internationally traded gas, which stood at 30% in 2021, falls to 15% by 2030 in the STEPS and to 10% in the APS. Importers in China have been actively contracting for liquefied natural gas, and there is no room in China’s projected gas balance for another large-scale pipeline from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trends in this energy war through early November 2022 are shown in Figure Two, and it is clear that the rise in energy prices through the late fall of 2022 illustrates the overall success of Russia’s ability to conduct economic warfare and the risks it may impose for the future. It should be stressed, however, that there is no way to predict the future extent to which Russia and OPEC states will cooperate, nor whether Russia may make a major effort to shift its energy exports from pipelines to northern Europe to pipelines to China and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such shifts in Russian exports to China would take time to make and major new pipelines to China would be highly expensive, require gas exports to be liquified, and tie Russia to a single customer, and present potential issues in dealing with climate change to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, estimates of future Chinese oil and gas demand by the International Energy Agency indicate that if Russia did shift its export capabilities to provide far larger exports to China, China would become a major Russian customer well beyond 2030. Moreover, any analyses of China’s strategic vulnerabilities do indicate that obtaining energy imports that did not pass through the Indian Ocean, Straits, and South China Sea could greatly reduce one of its key vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some argue that there is one area where such a war might have global benefits, but such benefits are questionable. Some analysts also feel that the energy crisis may help speed reductions in the global use of fossil fuel as well. However, the IEA stressed in its October 2022 estimates that reaching zero emissions by 2050 would require clean energy investments higher than $4 trillion by 2030. It also estimated that currently planned investments would only reach half of that figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-in-conventional-build-ups-by-the-us-nato-and-russia&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” in Conventional Build-Ups by the U.S., NATO, and Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a matter of semantics as to whether an arms race should be described as political or as military warfare, and the answer is probably both. The same is true of arms control, which generally is as much a battle for political influence, and the ability to use military forces as political leverage, as any move towards peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the War in the Ukraine has already shown Russia and the world that Russian conventional military forces have serious weaknesses, has helped lead to a new and more proactive NATO strategy, and led key Western nations like Germany and Britain to call for major increases in military spending. It has also led the United States to put more emphasis on NATO at a time it sees China as its primary threat and adopt a strategy that calls for major new efforts in military reform and modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. made this clear in the new National Security Strategy that it issued in October 2022:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Alongside our allies and partners, America is helping to make Russia’s war on Ukraine a strategic failure. Across Europe, NATO and the European Union are united in standing up to Russia and defending shared values. We are constraining Russia’s strategic economic sectors, including defense and aerospace, and we will continue to counter Russia’s attempts to weaken and destabilize sovereign nations and undermine multilateral institutions. Together with our NATO Allies, we are strengthening our defense and deterrence, particularly on the eastern flank of the Alliance. Welcoming Finland and Sweden to NATO will further improve our security and capabilities. And we are renewing our focus on bolstering our collective resilience against shared threats from Russia, including asymmetric threats. More broadly, Putin’s war has profoundly diminished Russia’s status vis-a-vis China and other Asian powers such as India and Japan. Moscow’s soft power and diplomatic influence have waned, while its efforts to weaponize energy have backfired. The historic global response to Russia’s war against Ukraine sends a resounding message that countries cannot enjoy the benefits of global integration while trampling on the core tenets of the UN Charter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While some aspects of our approach will depend on the trajectory of the war in the Ukraine, a number of elements are already clear. First, the United States will continue to support Ukraine in its fight for its freedom, we will help Ukraine recover economically, and we will encourage its regional integration with the European Union. Second, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory and will continue to build and deepen a coalition with allies and partners to prevent Russia from causing further harm to European security, democracy, and institutions. Third, the United States will deter and, as necessary, respond to Russian actions that threaten core U.S. interests, including Russian attacks on our infrastructure and our democracy. Fourth, Russia’s conventional military will have been weakened, which will likely increase Moscow’s reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning. The United States will not allow Russia, or any power, to achieve its objectives through using, or threatening to use, nuclear weapons. America retains an interest in preserving strategic stability and developing a more expansive, transparent, and verifiable arms control infrastructure to succeed New START and in rebuilding European security arrangements which, due to Russia’s actions, have fallen in to disrepair. Finally, the United States will sustain and develop pragmatic modes of interaction to handle issues on which dealing with Russia can be mutually beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new National Security Strategy also made it clear that the U.S was returning to a broader emphasis on supporting European security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Europe has been, and will continue to be, our foundational partner in addressing the full range of global challenges. To effectively pursue a common global agenda, we are broadening and deepening the transatlantic bond – strengthening NATO, raising the level of ambition in the U.S.-EU relationship, and standing with our European allies and partners in defense of the rules-based system that underpins our security, prosperity, and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, Europe stands at the front lines of the fight to defend the principles of freedom, sovereignty, and non-aggression, and we will continue to work in lockstep to ensure that freedom prevails. America remains unequivocally committed to collective defense as enshrined in NATO’s Article 5 and will work alongside our NATO Allies to deter, defend against, and build resilience to aggression and coercion in all its forms. As we step up our own sizable contributions to NATO capabilities and readiness – including by strengthening defensive forces and capabilities, and upholding our long-standing commitment to extended deterrence – we will count on our Allies to continue assuming greater responsibility by increasing their spending, capabilities, and contributions. European defense investments, through or complementary to NATO, will be critical to ensuring our shared security at this time of intensifying competition. We stand behind NATO’s continued adaptation to modern security challenges, including its emphasis on defense in cyberspace, climate security, and the growing security risks presented by the PRC’s policies and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the new U.S. strategy document described support of the Ukraine in terms close to support of continuing NATO aid at a level equivalent to proxy warfare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Europe has been, and will continue to be, our foundational partner in addressing the full range of global challenges. To effectively pursue a common global agenda, we are broadening and deepening the transatlantic bond – strengthening NATO, raising the level of ambition in the U.S.-EU relationship, and standing with our European allies and partners in defense of the rules-based system that underpins our security, prosperity, and values. Today, Europe stands at the front lines of the fight to defend the principles of freedom, sovereignty, and non-aggression, and we will continue to work in lockstep to ensure that freedom prevails. America remains unequivocally committed to collective defense as enshrined in NATO’s Article 5 and will work alongside our NATO Allies to deter, defend against, and build resilience to aggression and coercion in all its forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we step up our own sizable contributions to NATO capabilities and readiness – including by strengthening defensive forces and capabilities, and upholding our long-standing commitment to extended deterrence – we will count on our Allies to continue assuming greater responsibility by increasing their spending, capabilities, and contributions. European defense investments, through or complementary to NATO, will be critical to ensuring our shared security at this time of intensifying competition. We stand behind NATO’s continued adaptation to modern security challenges, including its emphasis on defense in cyberspace, climate security, and the growing security risks presented by the PRC’s policies and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;putting-the-conventional-military-balance-in-perspective&quot;&gt;Putting the Conventional Military Balance in Perspective&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As yet, there are no clear Russian plans to correct the many weaknesses the War in the Ukraine has revealed in its forces. It is clear, however, that Russia must be making such plans, and will take a much more competitive stance to shaping forces that can influence, deter, and – if necessary – fight NATO and Western supported countries. Putin’s speeches have made this all too clear, and Russia would in any case have to make major efforts to restructure and modernize its forces just to keep up with the many new advances in weaponry and military technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S., Canada, and NATO European states must make similar changes. They not only must compete with Russia, but also most must compensate for years of decline in the size of their forces, rates of modernization, and any real-world effort to improve interoperability either within their forces or by providing new forces and capabilities to match the changes in the most advanced national forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of the Ukraine has shown all too clearly that most NATO countries have underestimated the Russian threat and have taken excessive “peace dividends” in terms of cuts in their defense efforts since 1992. Most former Warsaw Pact states that are now in NATO, and on or near the borders of Russia have failed to properly convert and modernize their forces to fight as part of NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, most NATO countries also failed to take effective steps to correct this situation after Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. They never met NATO’s goal of spending 2% of their GDP on military forces, and those that did found that this goal was too low to properly modernize, and maintain, readiness and force size. Seen with the hindsight provided by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, NATO countries generally came closer to “farce” planning than force planning. So far, neither NATO nor any NATO country have made their plans to deal with this situation clearly. They do not publish meaningful force plans, net assessments, or projected budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, there is no current way to know how well either Russia or NATO countries will engage in the “war” to modernize their forces and make them more effective, although Russia is clearly attempting to increase its influence and military role in Belarus and Moldova. The broad structure of U.S., European NATO, and Russian conventional military balance is shown in Figure Three, along with the forces of China which is the core of another winter war discussed later in this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of traditional comparison of personnel and major weapons strength does not, however, approach a meaningful net assessment. It does not cover the wide range of competition for economic power, dominance in technology, and the capability to fund military competition between the United State and its strategic partners, Russia, and China. This analysis is far too long to include in this analysis, but it is summarized in a different study entitled Major Powers and Strategic Partners: A Graphic Net Assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not reflect the scale and impact of the massive cuts in the military forces of the former Soviet Union as shrank to become Russia, or the equally serious cuts in the forces that NATO countries deployed in Europe in 1992. It only compares key elements of force size based on active personnel and major weapons platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that it does not compare training, other elements of readiness, sustainment and warfighting reserves, military industrial and technology bases, deployments and power projection capabilities, and interoperability. It also does not show comparative modernization and the massive shifts taking place in the role of battle management and secure communications, space, cyber, smart and long-range munitions, artificial intelligence, joint all-domain capabilities, and all the other emerging and disruptive technologies that are reshaping military forces on a global basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such force comparisons help put the military dimension of the winter wars in perspective, but they also have serious limits. In many ways, traditional force comparisons are the equivalent of the kind of military analysis that focus only on infantry and cavalry before World War I, or that ignored the new role of armor, air power, and changes in the role of sea power before World War II. Put generously, traditional military strength analysis probably only addresses about 20% of modern military capability, and much of the “war” in the restructuring of Russian and NATO conventional forces triggered by the ongoing war in Ukraine will parallel the changes triggered by shifts in nuclear forces, dual capable forces, and precision conventional strike capabilities discussed later in this analysis. They will play out over the coming decades as a revolution in military forces that no one can currently predict and fully characterize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ukraine-war-and-the-conventional-arms-race&quot;&gt;The Ukraine War and the Conventional Arms Race&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are very real financial limits on what both sides can spend on improving and modernizing their conventional military forces, and the economic war between Russia and the West will have a major impact on their spending. The improvements in military capability that both sides must now make are also driven by the need to make very costly improvements in their military forces and will probably involve the need to higher percentages of total national GDPs over the period of a decade or more. This will inevitably increase the competition over military spending versus spending on civilian programs and needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is particularly true of Russia. The military and economic cost of the war in Ukraine alone has already reached levels which the Russian leadership almost certainly grossly underestimated in launching the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost to Western states and their strategic partners of their military and economic support for Ukraine has also been far higher than political leaders anticipated in shaping their initial aid plans. The rises in prices for energy and other imports mentioned earlier have raised inflation to critical levels, and there already have been political calls for less aid to Ukraine and broader political indications that NATO countries are cutting back on their plans to modernize and improve their forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, however, is now far poorer than its Western challengers. Once again, the full range of trends involved is too complex to show in this analysis and is provided in a separate report called Major Powers and Strategic Partners: A Graphic Net Assessment. One metric alone, however, shows how serious the economic challenges Russia faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank estimates that the U.S. alone had a GDP of $22.966 trillion in current dollars in 2021, the EU had a GDP of $17.089 trillion, and NATO estimates that NATO Europe and Canada had a GDP of some $22.687 billion. The World Bank estimates that Russia only had a GDP of $1.776 billion in 2021, which scarcely makes it an economic superpower in global terms. Unlike the U.S. its only major strategic partner is Belarus, which had a GDP of only $0.682 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democracies do have to respond to popular civil demands by paying far more of their government income to meet civil needs, but NATO’s total estimated GDP in 2021 was $45,653 trillion, some 26 times the Russia GDP of $1.776 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are no reliable ways to compare the publicly reported military spending of command economies like Russia or China – which often conceal key aspects of national security spending – with the relatively open and reliable reporting of Western states. If one looks at some of the best and most directly comparable estimates of military spending, however, NATO reports that the U.S. spent $793.99 billion on military forces in 2021, and NATO Europe spent $361.29 billion for a NATO total of some $1,096.6 billion. In contrast, the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimates that Russia spent only $62.2 billion by the NATO definition of defense spending. This is only 5.7% of the reported total for NATO, which is 17 times the Russian figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, these GDP and military spending figures indicate that Russia is anything but a superpower in economic strength and military spending military. This becomes even more clear if one looks at the GDP and military spending of China and America’s key Asian strategic partners as additional standards of comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank estimated that China had a GDP of $17,734 billion in current dollars, while key Asian strategic partners like Japan had a GDP of $4,937 billion and South Korea had $1,799 billion. These figures show that the World Bank estimated that China’s GDP was almost exactly ten times larger than Russia’s. If one looks at the IISS military spending estimates, the IISS indicates that China’s official military spending figure was $207 billion and was $270 billion by NATO’s definition. The $270 billion figure indicates that China was spending 4.5 times as much on military forces as Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These comparisons are critical because it seems likely that the winter of 2022-2023 will mark the beginning of a lasting military confrontation between Russia and NATO, and a race to modernize and improve military forces that will last at least as long as Putin is in power. If the previous economic and military spending figures do represent real comparative power, they indicate that the funding of such a race to improve the military capabilities could sharply favor the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also illustrate why the U.S. and Western effort to support Ukraine is so important, and so cost-effective. The U.S. aloe had sent well over $50 billion in military, humanitarian, and civil aid by November 2022 – scarcely a minor sum – and it was clear that the Ukraine would be dependent on outside aid indefinitely to both continue fighting and recover from the war after any settlement. The cost to Russia, however, was far greater and placed a burden on a far weaker economy – to the point where it was pushing Russia into the status of a second level military power. At the same time, it sent a critical message to China about U.S. strength and resolve that was equally important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. national security strategy issued in October 2022 singled out China as the primary threat to the U.S., and several key U.S. security partners in NATO – notably Britain – have recently focused on China. Funding a “race” to modernize NATO will be limited by the fact that the U.S. and some strategic partners must also focus on China and other threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, some experts question whether the current estimates of Russian military spending are too low. Russia has the potential military advantage of unity and a totalitarian leadership that can exert direct control over a command economy and do so with far less need to respond to popular civil needs. Although Russia also has suffered major losses in the fighting in Ukraine and has used up many of its reserves of weapons, munitions, and parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, NATO countries will enter the winter of 2022-2023 with major civil economic problems, and new popular demands for government spending that seem likely to limit member country military spending. NATO will also begin the broader Ukrainian War arms race having taken larger peace dividends over the last two decades, and with 30 (32?) member countries that have radically different force structures, poor overall interoperability, and radically different trends in real world force modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the unclassified data on the Russia military industrial base, and many key elements of its national and military technology base, are very limited. While it is not clear that this is still the case, it is also important to remember that Cold War intelligence estimates of the military expenditures of the Soviet Union were later shown to be gross underestimates of the actual spending as the West gained access to the Soviet Union. The same was true of the Soviet Union’s military research and development activities, and the size and efficiency of its military industries – many of which provide to be far larger – and at the same time less efficient – than expert estimated during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More data are available on the U.S. and Western military industrial base, and many key elements of its national and military technology base, but a close example indicates that many seemingly comparable data are not truly comparable, and that there are many gaps in coverage, particularly on actual programs, ongoing active activities, and any credible measures of effectiveness. It is also clear from the history of many national efforts that quantity is not a measure of quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-warin-precision-strike-capabilities-airmissile-defense-and-emergingdisruptive-technologies&quot;&gt;The “Winter War”in Precision Strike Capabilities, Air/Missile Defense, and Emerging/Disruptive Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, it is also important to put any such arms races in the proper context. Advances in military technology will have their own influence and all of the world’s major powers will have to compete in making major expenditures on new military technology, weapons, and new forms of warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and Ukraine have shown that new conventional weapons with precision strike capability, and advances in targeting and related forms of intelligence, can make a major difference in both military combat and in strike civilian targets. These weapons range from short-range systems like anti-tank missiles and drones to long range missiles and launch platforms ranging from hand-held weapons to theater-wide strike capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and a number of European states already have long-range precision conventional strike systems that can destroy critical infrastructure and high value targets, and all of the world’s major powers are working on the development of new longer-range ballistic, cruise, and new approach to strike technology. Other developments include other related advances in precision strike capabilities against critical civil and military systems, advances in many forms of targeting, and the deployment of steadily more to advanced 5th generation aircraft, in multi-platform weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost inevitably, these advances in strike systems mean that missile and air defenses will be a matching source of competition, and another form of “war.” As is discussed shortly, the advances in precision strike also creates the risk that many new systems may acquire dual capability and nuclear warheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the more advanced current defense systems like the Russian S-400 and the U.S. Patriot have serious increase limits and there are good reasons why Ukraine had steadily increased its calls for more advanced air and missile defenses, why Russia will seek to speed up the development of its new systems and why the U.S. and NATO Europe must now seriously consider major near-term investment in effective theater defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has also highlighted the vulnerability of existing armor, the need for more advanced artillery, the vulnerability of ships to missiles, and a host of other advances in secure communications, battle management, logistic support systems. They also interact with a wide range of new military technologies that affect the use of space, cyber warfare, artificial intelligence, and other emerging and “disruptive” technologies that can do far more to integrate every aspect of military operations and forms of joint all-domain operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these advances are cheap, but some deployments have already begun, and they may amount to a near revolution in military force structures and operations over the coming decade. This means the competition in the development and deployment of high technology military capabilities and systems will be a form of “warfare” where selecting the right mix of improvements could give one side a major advantage in terms of both deterrence and strategic leverage in peacetime, and where making the right investments selectively will be critical in shaping both deterrence and the nature of any actual warfighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winter of 2022-2023 is not likely to produce major new developments in these areas, but each round of Russian missile attacks and every expansion of the target base does increase NATO’s need to move more quickly, invest more, and develop some coherent plans for deployment in all four areas. Like many other aspects of the “winter war,” the fighting already is a major catalyst in shaping global arms races and one where it seems less and less likely that the world will return to anything like the levels of pre-Ukraine War stability, peace dividends, and arms control that had
existed since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-inrussia-us-and-western-and-chinese-nuclear-forces&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” inRussia, US and Western, and Chinese Nuclear Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges will also be further increased by yet another form of winter war. Russia has raised the issue of tactical nuclear warfare in the Ukraine War, and this is only a small part of the near collapse of many forms of nuclear arms control, and a steadily heightening nuclear arms that has reached the point where the competition in global strategic weapons has shifted from a competition between the U.S. and Russia to one that includes China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, Russia, the U.S., Britain, France, and China became involved in a major nuclear modernization effort long before the Ukraine War began. Here, a substantial amount of official unclassified data are available. The total nuclear weapons holdings of Russia, the U.S., Britain, France, and other powers are summarized in Figure Four. U.S. nuclear modernization plans are summarized in Figure Five, and Russian and Chinese plans are summarized in Figure Five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be stressed that the summaries in Figures Four, Five, and Six use unclassified material developed in 2021, and their contents may differ significantly from current intelligence estimates, as well as from outside analysts who produced Figures Four and Five, which include Hans M. Kristensen, Matt Korda, Robert Norris, and Amy F. Wolf of the Congressional Research Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data for China are particularly uncertain, since comparatively little unclassified detail is available on Chinese nuclear weapons developments. However, there have been reports that China has built three new fields of at least 250 new missile silos, and now has three new fast breeder reactors it can use to increase its production of Plutonium and nuclear weapons. Reports have also surfaced that China will actively participate in adapting different types of theater and tactical nuclear weapons to provide proven, functional nuclear warheads for the newer missile systems of Russia, China, and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the data for 2022 in Figure Five show, the War in the Ukraine has given Russian nuclear efforts a new and higher profile. Its importance has also been highlighted by the fact Putin has talked about “dirty” radiological bombs and made repeated references to the use of theater nuclear weapons, in his public speeches on the Ukraine War. Reports have also been made that Russian generals have begun to seriously discuss tactical and theater nuclear options, and members of the U.S. Congress have debated the need for new nuclear armed cruise missiles as a possible counter to such Russian weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is far from clear what holdings Russia and each NATO country now have of operational weapons because many are in storage, but unclassified estimates in Figure Four indicate that Russia has close to 2,000 theater and tactical nuclear weapons out of an inventory of as many as nearly 4,500 stored weapons, and the U.S. has some 3,750.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also clear that nuclear weapons represent the one major area where Russia is still a true superpower in military terms. The Ukraine war has made its weakness in conventional forces all too clear, and current estimates of its research and development resources indicate that it cannot compete with the West in military technology, or with the rising technology base of China. It does, however, have major holds of nuclear weapons that it inherited from the former Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some aspects of such estimates are uncertain – particularly for China; the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) is almost certainly broadly correct in estimating that Russia had some 6,257 nuclear weapons in its total inventory in 2021. This compared with 5,550 for the U.S., 350 for China, 225 for Britain, 290 for France, 160 for India, 165 for Pakistan, 90 for Israel, and 45 for North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s holdings also give it the ability to deploy large numbers of theater/tactical nuclear weapons, although the figures involved are uncertain. An unclassified estimate by the FAS indicates that Russia had 2,565 strategic nuclear warheads and 1,912 non-strategic and defensive force warheads in early 2022 and reported that some experts felt the latter number might double 2030. It also listed possible deployments of tactical and theater weapons in naval, air, land, and missile defense forces, and a wide range of possible delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no similar estimates of the holdings of non-strategic weapons by most other states, but the FAS does indicate that the U.S. may be the only power with large holdings that could be rapidly adapted for theater and tactical use. It could draw upon 2,000 nuclear in storage and 1,750 more weapons awaiting dismantlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FAS also reports that the U.S. had 100 B-61 nuclear bombs in Europe for F-16, F-18, Tornado, and F-35 combat aircraft with yields from 50 KT to 170 KT and is adapting some strategic weapons to have a lower yield option that could be used for theater and tactical targeting. It states that, “Belgian, Dutch, German, and Italian air forces are assigned nuclear strike missions with US nuclear weapons.” It reports France had some 300 variable yield nuclear weapons – three sets of 16 for its submarines and 54 cruise missiles for carrier and land-based Rafale delivery systems which could be used for both strategic and theater strikes. It does not report Britain as having tactical or theater nuclear weapons and indicate all of its weapons are for its SSBNs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arms Control Association reports that the United States has some 100 B-61 nuclear gravity bombs, and that that are forward-deployed at six NATO bases in five European countries: Aviano and Ghedi in Italy; Büchel in Germany; Incirlik in Turkey; Kleine Brogel in Belgium; and Volkel in the Netherlands. Another 130 U.S. B-61s are in inventory. France and Britain also may have low yield or other nuclear weapons in storage that could be used or modified for theater use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, a situation already exists where there is a revival of active competition in the deployment of theater nuclear forces as forms of military leverage and a higher – if still limited – risk of their use actual warfare fighting. It is also clear that the future of arms control is highly uncertain, and that Russia has on obvious incentive to try to use its nuclear weapons to obtain political and military leverage. Combined with the faltering progress in arms control and the fact the U.S must now compete with China as well as Russia, the War in the Ukraine again highlights the fact that there is another kind of Winter War, and one that potentially is far more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seems to be more than doubling its stockpile of nuclear weapons. May have risen from around 200 to 350 by 2020. 272 operational for exiting missiles and bombs and 78 for new systems. Possibly grew by 118 warheads during 2020-2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have detected 270+ new missile silos. 119 in Northwestern China seem to be for ICBMs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Has shunned arms control and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steadily improving nuclear command and control and battle management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deploying advanced solid-fuel mobile ICBMs (DF-21 &amp;amp; DF-31/DF-31A/DF-32AG), MIRV’d liquid-fueled ICBM (DF-5B), new MIRV’d DF-41 ICBM, Type 094 SSBN with JL-2 SLBMs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing low noise 096 SSBN and 9,000 kilometer range 096 SLBM.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Progressively harder to determine what theater and short-range delivery systems may become dual-capable. DF-21 MRBM (2,150 KM) and DF-26 IRBM (4,000 KM) known to be nuclear. DF-21 is precision strike, dual-capable and could deliver low-yield nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;May be evolving far beyond countervalue second strike capability. Examining use as theater warfare threat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-in-china-from-cooperation-and-competition-to-confrontation-and-active-war-planning&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” in China: From Cooperation and Competition to Confrontation and Active War Planning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, it is clear that the levels of tension between China and the U.S and several of its strategic partners have created yet another form of winter war. While the active combat in Ukraine has gotten more public attention than the growing level of political, economic, and military confrontation between China and the US and its European and Asian strategic partners, the extent of political and economic warfare between the U.S. and China is nearly as great, and the current level of military confrontation between the U.S. and China has received at least as much attention in U.S. strategic and war planning as the confrontation between the U.S. and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of tension between China and the West has also increased sharply as the world has entered the winter of 2022-2023. President Xi Jinping clearly emerged at the dominant leader of China at the 20th Party Congress in October 2022 and made it clear that he was committed to make China the dominant economic and military power in the world, and to expanding its political role and leverage on a global basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-china-in-the-new-us-national-security-strategy&quot;&gt;The Role of China in the New U.S. National Security Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. National Security Strategy issued October 2022 makes it clear that the U.S. now sees China as the primary threat to its security, and more in terms of war than any real intention to emphasize cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The 2022 National Defense Strategy advances a strategy focused on the PRC ,and on collaborating with our growing network of Allies and partners on common objectives. It seeks to prevent the PRC’s dominance of key regions while protecting the U.S. homeland and reinforcing a stable and open international system. Consistent with the 2022 National Defense Strategy, a key objective is to dissuade the PRC from considering aggression as a viable means of advancing goals that threaten vital U.S. national security interests. Conflict with the PTC is neither inevitable or desirable. The Department’s priorities support broader whole-of-government efforts to develop terms of interaction with the PRC that are favorable to our interests and values, while managing strategic competition and enabling the pursuit of cooperation on common challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…The most comprehensive and serious challenge to U.S. national security is the PRC’s coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor to refashion the Indo-Pacific region and the international system to suit its interests and authoritarian preferences, The PRC seeks to undermine U.S. alliances and security partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region, and leverage its growing strength and military footprint to coerce its neighbors and threaten their interests, The PRC’s increasingly provocative rhetoric and coercive activity towards Taiwan are destabilizing, risk miscalculation, and threaten the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait. This is part of a broader pattern of destabilizing and coercive Chinese behavior that stretches across the East China Sea, and along the Line of Actual Control. The PRC has expanded and modernized nearly every aspect of the PLA, with a focus on offsetting U.S. military advantages. The PRC is therefore the pacing challenge for the Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The PRC is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. Beijing has ambitions to create an enhanced sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and to become the world’s leading power. It is using its technological capacity and increasing influence over international institutions to create more permissive conditions for its own authoritarian model, and to mold global technology use and norms to privilege its interests and values. Beijing frequently uses its economic power to coerce countries. It benefits from the openness of the international economy while limiting access to its domestic market, and it seeks to make the world more dependent on the PRC while reducing its own dependence on the world. The PRC is also investing in a military that is rapidly modernizing, increasingly capable in the Indo-Pacific, and growing in strength and reach globally – all while seeking to erode U.S. alliances in the region and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…Our strategy toward the PRC is threefold: 1) to invest in the foundations of our strength at home – our competitiveness, our innovation, our resilience, our democracy, 2) to align our efforts with our network of allies and partners, acting with common purpose and in common cause, and 3) compete responsibly with the PRC to defend our interests and build our vision for the future. The first two elements – invest and align – are described in the previous section and are essential to out-competing the PRC in the technological, economic, political, military, intelligence, and global governance domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Competition with the PRC is most pronounced in the Indo-Pacific, but it is also increasingly global. Around the world, the contest to write the rules of the road and shape the relationships that govern global affairs is playing out in every region and across economics, technology, diplomacy, development, security, and global governance. In the competition with the PRC, as in other arenas, it is clear that the next ten years will be the decisive decade. We stand now at the inflection point, where the choices we make and the priorities we pursue today will set us on a course that determines our competitive position long into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many of our allies and partners, especially in the Indo-Pacific, stand on the frontlines of the PRC’s coercion and are rightly determined to seek to ensure their own autonomy, security, and prosperity. We will support their ability to make sovereign decisions in line with their interests and values, free from external pressure, and work to provide high-standard and scaled investment, development assistance, and markets. Our strategy will require us to partner with, support, and meet the economic and development needs of partner countries, not for the sake of competition, but for their own sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will act in common purpose to address a range of issues – from untrusted digital infrastructure and forced labor in supply chains and illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. We will hold Beijing accountable for abuses – genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, human rights violations in Tibet, and the dismantling of Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms – even as it seeks to pressure countries and communities into silence. We will continue prioritizing investments in a combat credible military that deters aggression against our allies and partners in the region, and can help those allies and partners defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;growing-chinese-ties-to-russia&quot;&gt;Growing Chinese Ties to Russia?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, serious questions exist about the extent to which U.S. and other security efforts to deal with China can be separated from those necessary to deal with Russia. Although most experts feel there are serious limits to the level of “friendship” and alliance between the two countries, this is far from certain. For example, Japan’s 2022 defense white paper notes that Russian and Chinese overflights and naval exercises have sharply increased in the areas north of Japan and treats them as a serious potential threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. National Security Strategy, issued in October 2022 makes it clear that the U.S. sees both China and Russia as major threats to the international order, although it views such threats as different in character:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The People’s Republic of China harbors the intention and increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its benefit, even as the United States remains committed to managing the competition between our countries responsibly….The most pressing strategic challenge facing our vision is from powers that layer authoritarian governance with a revisionist foreign policy. It is their behavior that poses a challenge to international peace and stability – especially waging or preparing for wars of aggression, actively undermining the democratic political processes of other countries, leveraging technology and supply chains for coercion and repression, and exporting an illiberal model of international order. Many non-democracies join the world’s democracies in forswearing these behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Russia and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) do not. Russia and the PRC pose different challenges. Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and open international system, recklessly flouting the basic laws of the international order today, as its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine has shown. The PRC, by contrast, is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… we recognize that globalization has delivered immense benefits for the United States and the world but an adjustment is now required to cope with dramatic global changes such as widening inequality within and among countries, the PRC’s emergence as both our most consequential competitor and one of our largest trading partners, and emerging technologies that fall outside the bounds of existing rules and regulations. We have an affirmative agenda for the global economy to seize the full range of economic benefits of the 21st century while advancing the interests of American workers. Recognizing we have to move beyond traditional Free Trade Agreements, we are charting new economic arrangements to deepen economic engagement with our partners, like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF); a global minimum tax that ensures corporations pay their fair share of tax wherever they are based in the world; the Partnership for Global Investment and Infrastructure (PGII) to help low- and middle-income countries secure high-standard investment for critical infrastructure; updated rules of the road for technology, cyberspace, trade, and economics; and ensuring the transition to clean energy unlocks economic opportunities and good jobs around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… The world is now at an inflection point. This decade will be decisive, in setting the terms of our competition with the PRC, managing the acute threat posed by Russia, and in our efforts to deal with shared challenges, particularly climate change, pandemics, and economic turbulence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also made it clear since at least the early 1990s that its military build-up is focused largely on the U.S., the Pacific, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the Middle East. It has cooperated with Russia in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization since the days when it was the Shanghai Five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also based much of its military modernization on Russian weapons and technology, and Japan’s 2022 defense white paper notes that Russian and Chinese overflights and naval exercises have sharply increased in the areas north of Japan and treats them as a serious potential threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it seems likely that Russia will ultimately emerge from the war in the Ukraine in greater need of a major outside strategic partners, China and Russia could both gain from a stronger partnership in the strategic aspects of their wars in energy, economics, and technology, and building up their military strength in gaining military leverage and in the event of any serious regional or theater conflict. It is true that authoritarian regimes tend to seek partnerships that serve the ambitions of their individual leader, but in this case that ambitions may increasingly coincide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-military-build-up&quot;&gt;China’s Military Build-Up&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China does seem to be far more successful than Russia in moving towards the point where it can compete directly with the U.S. and its strategic partners in conventional military power. The new U.S. strategy describes China’s efforts to improve its conventional military forces in terms that describe them as focusing on all the major elements of the U.S. effort to improve its conventional military forces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In addition to expanding its conventional forces, the PRC is rapidly advancing and integrating its space, counterspace, electronic, and informational warfare capabilities to support its holistic approach to joint warfare. The PLA seeks to target the ability of the Joint Force to project power to defend vital U.S. interests and our Allies in a crisis or conflict. The PRC is also expanding the PLA’s global footprint and working to establish a more robust overseas and basing infrastructure to allow it to project power at greater distances. In parallel, the PRC is accelerating the modernization and expansion of its nuclear capabilities. The United States and its Allies and partners will increasingly face the challenge of deterring two major powers with modern and diverse nuclear capabilities – the PRC and Russia – creating new stress on strategic stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has already made significant progress in achieving parity with the U.S. The conventional balance shown earlier in Figure Three reflects massive increases in China’s conventional military strength since 1990, and these numbers only show a comparatively small part of the massive Chinese shift away from a reliance on creating the largest possible ground forces to defend Chinese territory in 1990 to creating land, naval forces, and air forces as modern or more modern that U.S. forces. China has been creating major power projection capabilities in the Pacific and Indian Ocean since at least the md-1990s, and China has published a variety of unclassified defense white papers and strategies that make it clear that it is seeking to become superior in its ability to use the most advanced emerging and disruptive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unclassified series of estimates of the growth of Chinese sea power relative to U.S. sea power is shown in Figure Seven, and shows that China is not only becoming a major blue water navy, but could also overtake the US Navy in numbers. While Chinese ships would generally be smaller, they do not need the ability to project power across the entire Pacific over long periods of time that the U.S. Navy must provide, and work by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and General Accountability Office (GAO) warn that the U.S. Navy may have significantly overestimated the ship building efforts that current budgets allow it to perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of Chinese efforts over the past few decades are also reflected in the estimate of the military balance in the northwestern Pacific is shown in Figure Eight. It shows that Chinese, Taiwanese, and U.S. military forces are already postured for a possible war over Taiwan, and the overall level of military confrontation in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, Figure Nine shows that unclassified intelligence assessments, and a variety of unclassified studies by outside experts, report that that China is increasing its military spending far more quickly than Russia, and Figure Ten highlights a Japanese official estimate of how the increases in Chinese military spending are affecting some key aspects of the regional balance by showing the rising totals of modern Chinese naval surface vessels, submarines, and combat aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures Nine and Ten show that China and Xi can also draw upon a far stronger economic base and level of military spending in stepping up such competition than Putin can in Russia. China is also making a far larger annual investment in technology and a far higher level of manufacturing capability. These affect many aspects of its comparative military industrial base and ability to eventually match the U.S. and West’s technology base – trends that are shown in detail in Major Powers and Strategic Partners: A Graphic Net Assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trends in latter assessment also show that China’s rapid growth as a global economic trading power, aggressive foreign investment, and state-driven ability to seek economic ties and leverage on global basis – exemplified by its Belt and Road Initiative – have made it a much more serious challenger than Russia, although its action have alienated a number of states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s future growth does, however, face growing challenges. Its rate of economic growth has diminished since 2021, it has badly mismanaged its effort to deal with COVID, its property market is in a crisis, its labor and manufacturing costs are rising, it is over-regulating its technology sector, unemployment is rising, and its population is aging. Nevertheless, China is still growing sharply as a military and global power, and the U.S. National Security Strategy issued October 2022 makes it clear that the U.S. now sees China as the primary threat to its security, and more in terms of war than any real intention to emphasize cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The 2022 National Defense Strategy advances a strategy focused on the PRC ,and on collaborating with our growing network of Allies and partners on common objectives. It seeks to prevent the PRC’s dominance of key regions while protecting the U.S. homeland and reinforcing a stable and open international system. Consistent with the 2022 National Defense Strategy, a key objective is to dissuade the PRC from considering aggression as a viable means of advancing goals that threaten vital U.S. national security interests. Conflict with the PTC is neither inevitable or desirable. The Department’s priorities support broader whole-of-government efforts to develop terms of interaction with the PRC that are favorable to our interests and values, while managing strategic competition and enabling the pursuit of cooperation on common challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…The most comprehensive and serious challenge to U.S. national security is the PRC’s coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor to refashion the Indo-Pacific region and the international system to suit its interests and authoritarian preferences, The PRC seeks to undermine U.S. alliances and security partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region, and leverage its growing strength and military footprint to coerce its neighbors and threaten their interests, The PRC’s increasingly provocative rhetoric and coercive activity towards Taiwan are destabilizing, risk miscalculation, and threaten the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.

The PRC has expanded and modernized nearly every aspect of the PLA, with a focus on offsetting U.S. military advantages. The PRC is therefore the pacing challenge for the Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;guessing-at-the-future&quot;&gt;Guessing at the Future&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no reliable way to project the comparative rate of Chinese and U.S. modernization at this point of time. As has already been discussed in the case of Russia, the unclassified data on Chinese military industrial base, and many key elements of its national and military technology base, are very limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, it is also important to point out that more unclassified data are available on the U.S. and Western military industrial base, and many key elements of its national and military technology base, but a close example indicates that many seemingly comparable data are not truly comparable, and that there are many gaps in coverage, particularly on actual programs, ongoing active activities, and any credible measures of effectiveness. It is also clear from the history of many national efforts that quantity is not a measure of quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The available unclassified data do clearly indicate that China’s efforts are now massively greater than Russia. Nevertheless, it is still far from clear when China expects achieve any parity in its conventional forces and power projection capabilities in its areas of primary interest. Chinese national strategy and defense reports have listed a number of possible years for such parity that have extended from the late 2020s to well beyond 2035. In practice, however. China has been careful to qualify their meaning and strategic impact. It also has failed to tie them to future forces levels, success in meeting modernization goals, and levels of defense spending, or any clear intensions to use them for active combat as distinguished from military leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, the full range of U.S. efforts to reshape and modernize its forces to deal with China is also unclear. The full impact of the new strategy on U.S. plans to deal with China and Russia will only begin to become clear when the President submits his new defense budget proposal to Congress early in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S., however, is already reshaping its Navy and Marine Corps to deal with the emerging Chinese threat, however, and media reports make it clear that it is conducting a wide range of war games and studies to deal with the possibility of war to defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion as well as to support Japan, Australia, South Korea, and other partners and friendly states. The National Security Strategy document notes that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have an abiding interest in maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, which is critical to regional and global security and prosperity and a matter of international concern and attention. We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side, and do not support Taiwan independence. We remain committed to our one China policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances. And we will uphold our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act to support Taiwan’s self-defense and to maintain our capacity to resist any resort to force or coercion against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any major conflict or clash between the U.S. and China seems unlikely in the near term, and both President Biden and a top U.S. official in the Department of Defense have stated that war is unlikely in next two years, although he expects the PRC to increase pressure on Taiwan as it expands its military capabilities for an amphibious invasion. Two years, however, is scarcely a long period in strategic terms, and media reports make it clear that the U.S. is conducting war games and exercises to find the best way to deal with a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and is planning for a sudden war over Taiwan and one that could easily escalate to cover much of the South China Sea and the rest of the western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the “Winter War” between the U.S. and China is far more serious at a practical military level than U.S. and Chinese political rhetoric usually indicates and presents a special challenge for the US. The late Andrew Marshal highlighted this challenge early in China’s competition with the U.S. by highlight what he called “countervailing power:” The ability of one side to pressure the other by create a military crisis and build-up that forced the other spend far more of its money and military efforts to meet a challenge than the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, Taiwan is a clear case in point. Competing at the far end of the Pacific where China normally deploys much of its military power, and over the comparative vast distances the Pacific imposes in terms of power projection, is far more expensive for the U.S. than for China. China could step up the level of force the U.S. needs to compete through relatively simple deployments and at little cost, and it takes relatively minimal risk. A successful U.S. defense of Taiwan would scarcely lead to an invasion of China and would confront the U.S. with having to then sustain a far greater forward military presence tailored to the defense of one strategic partner, while any U.S. failure to defend would undermine its entire strategic position in Asia. The base case for the U.S. is close to the worst case in terms of countervailing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also clear from the U.S. National Security Strategy that the U.S. sees the expansion of Chinese influence in Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the Gulf, the rest of the Middle East, and Africa as hostile and as a far broader threat. No one on either side can dismiss that risk of a conflicts somewhere else in the Pacific or Asia, or be certain of the level of theater-wide escalation or intensity of combat that might occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the level of tension over trade, economic policy, and technological espionage has also reached a level of confrontation bordering on economic warfare. China is after all the land of Sun Tzu and has already shown how well it can focus on forms of warfare that rely on economic power and military influence rather than combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it seems likely that if the full range of Western intelligence on Chinese nuclear weapons, and nuclear and dual-capable delivery systems was made public, it might well indicate that China intends to become a far larger nuclear power and one that can directly compete in strength with the U.S. and Russia. Certainly, its improvement in ICBMs and SSBNs, and its development of a wide range of longer range and advanced strike systems will be given far greater capacity than it has had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A meeting of President Biden and President XI on November 14th, 2022, tried to put a different face on these developments, and give the impression that the U.S. and China were actively seeking to improve their level of cooperation. In reality, however, it seemed to be largely an attempt to find ways to maintain trade and more limited forms of economic cooperation between two powers that were actively involved in political and economic warfare in many areas than any real progress towards real cooperation and cutbacks in their military build-ups on ongoing levels of political and economic warfare. It was all too clear from the White House statements about the meeting that the meeting did not resolve any key issues, but was designed rather to find some areas where both sides could benefit without making any serious changes in their competition, and that it reflected more of a reaction to the common problems the U.S. and China faced because of COVID and the war in Ukraine than any serious effort to change their strategic positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Xi and the 20th Party Congress, and the new US National Security Strategy issued in October 2022 have already made China part of a “winter war,” and one with all of the same major risks as the “winter war” with Russia. However, this is a combination of military confrontation and political and economic conflict whose intensity has been steadily rising for more than a decade, and that seems just as likely to ensure for years to come as the “winter war” with Putin’s Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-in-the-middle-east&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” in the Middle East&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a wide range of other active and potential “winter wars,” most of which preceded the War in Ukraine, and that involve threats and actual conflicts that will continue through the winter of 2022-2023. Many seem certain to continue for years to come. All have the potential to become much worse, however, and their cumulative impact places yet another major burden on U.S. and partner resources and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key center of such “winter wars” is North Africa, the Middle East, and the Persian/Arab Gulf. Algeria and Libya are key centers of instability and civil tension in North Africa. Syria and Iran are key centers of instability in the Middle East, Iraq’s stability and unity is uncertain, and it seems likely that the Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Tigray, Somalia, and Yemen will continue to be flashpoints in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps explain why the U.S. has been actively involved in warfare in the Persian/Arab Gulf region since at least the first Gulf War in 1990, although it was indirectly involved in the Iran-Iraq War during 1980-1988, as well as every major Arab-Israel conflict. It is still involved in the fighting in eastern Syria and support its strategic partners in their fight against terrorism and their deterrence of external threats. Russia is involved in the civil war in Libya and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a purely military viewpoint, Iran is the most current serious regional threat in the region. Its arms race with the Arab Guld states has been a war for political and military leverage. Iran is also a potential nuclear power, and one that may well have completed the design and passive testing of non-fissile nuclear weapons. It can come steadily closer to the production of weapons grade Uranium, and it that may form serious security and economic ties to Russia and China. There is also a risk that Iran may be able to form a more serious security alliance with Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and even a Hezbollah dominated Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia are both competing with the U.S., Britain, and France for military influence and leverage in the region. China now has a military base in Djibouti, is playing a major role in the development of Pakistan’s ports and may be seeking to create more serious ties to Iran that include port facilities on its territory outside the Gulf. Russia is buying missiles and drones from Iran and Russian mercenaries have been active in the Libyan civil war. In contrast, U.S. ties to Egypt and the Arab Gulf states are weakening, as is European influence and ability to deploy land and air forces east of Suez. It is also clear that extremist and terrorist movements continue to be a threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Figure Eleven shows, the Middle East and nearby areas in North Africa and Asia are also major centers of terrorism and extremism. The terrorist activities sometimes interact on a regional basis, and most are driven by both failed governance and development, and at least low-level fighting between sects, ethnic groups, and tribes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As yet, these shifts do not seem to pose serious risks of new levels of conflict, but they do have that potential. Moreover, U.S. relations with Turkey do seem to be steadily more distant, and the overall level of development, stability, and security in the region continues to decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-in-asia-and-the-koreas&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” in Asia and the Koreas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Afghan conflict seems to be over, although the Taliban have yet to show they can actually govern effectively. However, Asia and the Indian Ocean region present a continuing range of regional and internal security problems and the own range of wars for territory and military influence. China has recently clashed with India. India and Pakistan are steadily arming for another possible round of war, that could involve the use of nuclear weapons. Myanmar is a nightmare of internal conflict and repression, Afghanistan faces major internal instability, and there is a wide range of religious and ethnic tensions that include Chinese repression of the Uyghurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most serious current risk of a major conflict in the in the region, however, seems to be the rising level of tension and arms race between North Korea and South Korea, which could easily escalate to involve the U.S. and Japan, and possibly Russia and China.An estimate of the conventional military balance in the Koreas is shown in Figure Twelve, but it seems likely that the level of U.S. forces in South Korea would change so quickly if a serious combat began that such a Figure can only provide limited insight into the risks involved. It also does not mention North Korea’s possession of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of Figure Twelve also warns that North Korea has begun a new kind of “winter war” by sharply increasing its missile firings, and this chart does not include the further massive increases in missile tests, and violations of South Korean territory in October and November of 2022. By early November. North Korea had already launched 86 missiles – an annual record – and fired 23 missiles in one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Korean missile tests have illustrated its potential threat to Japan, and to U.S. military bases in Japan and Guam, and North Korea seems to have tested an ICBM-like missile in November 2022, although the test failed. It is clear that North Korea is increasing its nuclear weapons inventory, is making extensive use of its centrifuge facilities to produce more fissile material and may conduct its first nuclear weapon test in years during the winter of 2022-2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, this new level of confrontation does seem to be designed more to use military force to gain influence than present a near-term risk of any major conflict. Nevertheless, the possibility remains of that incident could trigger such a conflict. North Korea’s ties to China, its recent sales of artillery weapons Russia, and the sheer extremism of North Korea’s authoritarian leader are all warnings that such an incident could occur in ways that involve all of the major powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-wars-in-gray-area-spoiler-and-proxy-campaigns&quot;&gt;The “Winter Wars” in Gray Area, Spoiler, and Proxy Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way to predict what existing or new gray area, spoiler, or proxy campaigns will escalate to the point where they become serious problems for the U.S. or its partners, but many risks already exist – including ones in Latin America and the rest of Africa, and rising tensions with China and Russia will inevitably increase this risk over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, Russia’s trade war with the West qualifies as a serious level of gray area operations, as does the West’s proxy war in the Ukraine, and Russia’s more direct proxy roles in Syria and Libya. So does China’s effort to control critical mineral and manufacturing resources in solid state devices, batteries, and other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and its strategic partners also have come to realize how serious industrial and technology espionage and efforts to dominate key areas of trade have become, and that these are serious forms of gray area warfare that they have taken actions to address that approach to economic warfare. The same seems to be true of Chinese efforts to control strategic minerals and investment patterns that have been designed to give China added economic leverage, particularly in areas like the materials need for advanced batteries and solid-state devices – area critical to both civil and military technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-winter-war-in-fragile-divided-autonomous-undeveloped-states-and-against-terrorism-and-extremism&quot;&gt;The “Winter War” in Fragile, Divided, Autonomous Undeveloped States, and Against Terrorism and Extremism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is no doubt that the larger “winter wars” are only part of the overall threat to the developing world, where most states face increasing problems in terms of food supplies, energy imports, and poverty this winter, as well as serious damage from climate change and global warming. These have, however, been increased to some extent by the War in the Ukraine’s impact on food exports and energy costs, and many of these problems are the result of internal tensions and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new U.S. National Security Strategy recognizes the existence of a growing global food crisis and energy problems. The various NGO lists of fragile states also reflect a growing number of what are called “fragile states,” also they often should really be called “failed states” or governments – something that is all too clear when the rankings of “fragile states” are compared with the corruption rankings of Transparency International and the governance rankings of the World Bank. UN estimates of population growth, and various failed state indices of NGOs warn that this is a major problem for poorer and less developed states that gets far too little practical attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global trends in the winter of 2022-2023, and the risk they create of more serious forms of war, are also clear. The IMF World Economic Outlook for 2022, issued in October 2022, warns that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our latest forecasts project global growth to remain unchanged in 2022 at 3.2 percent and to slow to 2.7 percent in 2023 – 0.2 percentage points lower than the July forecast – with a 25 percent probability that it could fall below 2 percent. More than a third of the global economy will contract this year or next, while the three largest economies – the United States, the European Union, and China – will continue to stall. In short, the worst is yet to come, and for many people 2023 will feel like a recession. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to powerfully destabilize the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beyond the escalating and senseless destruction of lives and livelihoods, it has led to a severe energy crisis in Europe that is sharply increasing costs of living and hampering economic activity. Gas prices in Europe have increased more than four-fold since 2021, with Russia cutting deliveries to less than 20 percent of their 2021 levels, raising the prospect of energy shortages over the next winter and beyond. More broadly, the conflict has also pushed up food prices on world markets, despite the recent easing after the Black Sea grain deal, causing serious hardship for low-income households worldwide, and especially so in low-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Persistent and broadening inflation pressures have triggered a rapid and synchronized tightening of monetary conditions, alongside a powerful appreciation of the US dollar against most other currencies. Tighter global monetary and financial conditions will work their way through the economy, weighing demand down and helping to gradually subjugate inflation. So far, however, price pressures are proving quite stubborn and a major source of concern for policymakers. We expect global inflation to peak in late 2022 but to remain elevated for longer than previously expected, decreasing to 4.1 percent by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank warns that while the rise in global poverty caused by COVID may now be declining, this decline is uncertain and that some 75 to 95 additional millions of people are still in a state of dire poverty. Its 2022 Poverty and Prosperity Report indicates that, “nearly half the world – over 3 billion people – lives on less than US $6.85 per day, which is the average of the national poverty lines of upper-middle-income countries,” and that “574 million people – nearly 7 percent of the world’s population – will still be living on less than US $2.15 a day in 2030.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no coincidence that the World Bank list of Fragile and Conflict Affected Situations in FY2022 shown in Figure Thirteen includes so many countries governed by regimes that have failed to develop effectively, have failed to heal the division between their peoples are actively exploited, and/or highly authoritarian and repressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the UN Human Development Report for 2022, reports record levels of political polarization, and negative views of the world, and that more than 6 in 7 people polled feel insecure about the level of global progress. It notes that declines on the Human Development Index (HDI) were widespread, with over 90 percent of countries enduring a decline in 2020 or 2021. The Global Peace Index, which covers 163 countries, found the 11th deterioration in peacefulness in the last fourteen years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These negative trends were partly driven by the impact of COVID, and the inflation and food crisis caused by the War in the Ukraine, but they were also driven by failed national governance over what has normally been periods of several decades, and the end result is that there has been a steady rise in global political extremism, and in ethnic, sectarian, and tribal tensions and conflicts. They have also led to a more than 100% increase in the number of refugees since 2011, and an 8% increase in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UNHCR report on the global trends in refugees for 2022 reports that by the end of 2021, there were 27.1 million refugees globally and 53.2 million people displaced within their home countries. In virtually every case, the country involved at most received humanitarian aid and only provided temporary relief and failed to make any serious advances in development or providing lasting solutions to the problems that were creating more refugees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer scale of the current level of global conflicts is illustrated in the fact that the summary list of ongoing conflicts that is available on Wikipedia is four pages long, although this list ignores many smaller ethnic, sectarian, tribal, and other low-level internal civil conflicts. ACLED also provides an extensive analysis of such conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of global terrorism and extremism have also risen in recent years, as is shown in the graphs showing the trends in global terrorism developed by START shown in Figure Fourteen, and in the series of maps in available in the Counterterrorism Guide of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence. It also is all too clear from the 2021 U.S. State Department Country reports on Terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key irony behind any focus on these trends in terrorism and extremism, however, is that they are a relatively minor part of the problems affecting the overall patterns in global violence, particularly in lower incomes states. If one examines the trends and impact of poor governance, corruption, leadership that favors given internal factions, failed development efforts, and repression; they almost certainly do more to threaten their populations than terrorists or extremists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially true of governments that Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way have characterized as competitive authoritarianism: “In competitive authoritarian regimes, formal democratic institutions are widely viewed as the principal means of obtaining and exercising political authority. Governments that control a pliant or cowed media as well as the security services and many elements of the economy and where the regime fails to meet conventional minimum standards for democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, such authoritarian governments probably do at least an order of magnitude more damage to their peoples than terrorist and extremist movements. They also make their countries more vulnerable to exploitation by more developed powers and encourage more developed powers to exploit their weakness and instability interact with the forces creating instability. One key example is Assad’s Syria. His Russian-backed war to reestablish his power and control has been estimated to have killed as many as 499,700 to 600,000 by March 2022. More conservative estimates put the figure at over 350,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates of the total deaths caused by terrorism and extremism differ sharply, but a high estimate indicates that they average around 26,000 per year over the same ten-year period as the estimate for Syria, or a total 260,000. Statista reports annual figures ranging from 11,098 to 32,763, or 250,141 for the eleven years of the Syrian civil war. The Global Terrorism Index For 2022 reports only 7,142 deaths from terrorism and extremism, in 2021, and an uneven pattern of decline in deaths from a peak of only 10,669 in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Syria is only the worst of many countries where governments kill their peoples. No similar estimates are available, but there are all too many examples. Myanmar is certainly one of the worst. Iran is another, and there are all too many additional states in Africa and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it should be remembered that all of these trends generally interact with failures to adequately cope with disease, global warming, and population growth. The first two of these trends are already the source of global attention, but Figure Fifteen indicates a massive rate of actual population growth between 1950 and 2020 that makes the additional threat from population pressure all too clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-peace-globalism-and-a-global-village-to-a-world-filled-with-global-tensions-and-warfare&quot;&gt;From Peace, “Globalism,” and a “Global Village” to a World Filled with Global Tensions and Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this discussion of “winter wars” may seem to be deliberately pessimistic and to focus on worst cases. It also discusses wars that have sometimes already gone on for decades, and many that seem likely to gone on for a decade or more after the winter of 2022-2023. It is still striking, however, that it describes overall patterns in global violence and conflict a world where it has taken less than a decade to go from a focus on how the world might come together in a form of “globalism” – one that approximates a peaceful and cooperative “global village” – to a world with so many tensions and risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the broad use of the term “war,” this analysis also shows that Sun Tzu was all too correct in stating that “the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.” World War I and World War II have shown how dangerous it can be to escalate to major conflicts, and today’s world of nuclear weapons, tightly integrated global supply chains, and steadily more lethal forms of conventional combat have greatly increased the damage a truly major war can inflict. It is all too clear that the relations between the great powers, and between the more advanced and developed democracies and authoritarian and repressive states, have shifted from the image of cooperation to active confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis shows that major powers and developed nations are actively involved in trying to achieve the “supreme art of war.” The list of “winter wars” makes it all too clear that major powers now focus on political and economic conflicts and confrontations and on efforts to use military force that are limited to exploiting political and military leverage without engaging in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the major powers still seem to find it obligatory to at least mention “cooperation,” and actively seek to keep some degree of real-world cooperation in areas where all sides can still benefit from cooperation, the primary focus of their political and economic confrontation, and military build-ups, has clearly shifted. They are all trying to achieve their strategic objectives by creating a far more confrontational set of military goals and plans, and taking more serious risks in terms of political and economic struggles that at least approach a form of warfare and increase the risk of some form of escalation to the actual use of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the analysis does understate the full threat of “winter wars” to the extent it has touched relatively briefly on the number of developing and poorer states that are experiencing serious internal violence, and where the failures of their governments to come to grips with internal tensions, population growth, and sustained development makes them as much of a threat to their peoples as any terrorist or extremist faction. It has not tried to address the combined impact of war, climate change, population pressure, and disease – although all of these problems reinforce each other, and climate change, population pressure, and disease – like failed governance – often have greater impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the analysis has concentrated on the nature and scale of key types of political, economic and military conflicts, but not on whether any given side has a clear strategic objective in trying to “win.” Putin’s grand strategic objective seems to be close to one of rebuilding the former Soviet Union and strategic partnerships of equal importance, but there is no way to know how real this goal really is. The same is true of China’s grand strategic objectives which are equally broad and vague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. new national strategy does talk about the creation of a world with a common economic system and set of international rules – one most it strategic partners support but does not present any plan for achieving it. As for all too much of the rest of the world – rhetoric aside – the national grand strategic goal of its leadership seems to be to retain or expand their power at the national, local, and regional level. The current process of a given “winter war” is clear, but the grand strategic goal is not defined beyond some broad level of rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santana once warned that “he who forgets the past is condemned to repeat it.” In some ways, the world has already done so in two World Wars. For all of the military tensions that preceded World War I, most Europeans though assumed that the equivalent of a stable level of deterrence had been established following the war of 1870, which would prevent any major European conflict in spite of the arms races that were increasing the lethality and size of European forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results were devastating, but similar assumptions about postwar stability largely governed Europe until the depression and the collapse of the Weimar democracy in Germany, and then helped encourage isolationism and appeasement until the German invasion of Poland. The result was World War II – a war that did even more damage on a global basis than World War I, and then helped to create a Cold War that may well be returning in more lethal and even more global form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, this analysis of Winter Wars warns that the corollary to Santana’s thesis may well be that “we repeat the past regardless of whether we remember it or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

Fosun’s investments in Portugal provide insight into the Chinese Communist Party’s activism in shaping the business environment for private sector players, as the company’s international strategy faced the challenge of balancing alignment with state goals against a regulatory crackdown on private sector outbound spending.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In recent years, China’s unique brand of state capitalism has undergone profound changes at home and abroad. These have involved a widening array of state and non-state actors and an enhanced role for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in both top-down economic strategy and bottom-up business decisions for a range of companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previous reports in this series on the evolving Chinese economic model have detailed, this latest iteration of state-directed economic decisionmaking is most notable for the increasingly complex array of incentives and alignments between commercial and national strategic objectives that characterize outbound spending by Chinese companies today. This framework for conceptualizing, and responding to, the unique non-market aspects of China’s emerging global investment regime is best articulated as a shift from “China Inc.” to “CCP Inc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“CCP Inc.” is comprised of an ecosystem of key state-owned and private commercial actors, state-owned financiers, government regulators, and CCP organs that are connected through an increasingly complex web of direct and indirect transactional, financial, strategic, operational, and political relationships. Importantly, these ecosystems operate both within the domestic commercial space, where they have been honed to provide integral support to state development goals, as well as in the international commercial space, where they provide a significant boost to the reach and economic influence of a given Chinese commercial entity, when compared with standalone private sector competitors from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study explores how the CCP Inc. ecosystem has enabled a range of state-owned and private Chinese companies to embed into Portugal’s financial system with a view toward widening China’s financial presence within the country, in Europe more broadly, and in a range of other markets. This study focuses in particular on Fosun International Limited [复星国际有限公司] — a Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of the Shanghai-headquartered conglomerate Fosun Group and a key private sector player — which for many years has acted as a prominent source of foreign direct investment into Portugal’s financial sector, alongside and in concert with a range of Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, this study will examine the role of two key Fosun subsidiaries in Portugal — insurer Fidelidade Companhia de Seguros, SA, (Fidelidade) and Banco Comercial Português (BCP Millennium) — and the role they have played in enabling the CCP Inc. ecosystem to engage in Portugal’s financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pMIFvQS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, this study will explore how Fosun — as a nominally private company — was both allowed and encouraged to invest heavily in a range of Portuguese assets as the contours of the CCP Inc. model have developed in recent years. Fosun’s success in aligning its investments within the parameters of the CCP Inc. framework is particularly notable given that its expansion in Portugal occurred at a time when outbound private investment by other major Chinese conglomerates was not only under scrutiny but also being actively reined in by senior Chinese officials, who had become acutely concerned about aggressive outbound spending by the Chinese private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unique ability of Fosun to continue investing abroad at a time when private sector outbound spending was otherwise being actively curtailed speaks to one key aspect of the CCP Inc. model: private sector alignment with national strategic objectives. While such alignment has long been a part of the key performance indicators for China’s SOEs, the CCP’s activism in shaping the business environment for private sector players, as well as increasingly impacting the business strategies of private companies, is a more recent phenomenon. It is also foundational to the shift from the earlier “China Inc.” model to today’s “CCP Inc.” ecosystem. Nowhere is this more evident, at present, than in China’s domestic technology sector, specifically regarding platform economies, as the CCP has sought to bring the sector firmly in line with national governance objectives over the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this dynamic is also apparent in China’s approach to outbound spending and specifically in recent investments in Portugal’s financial sector. As Portugal has become a critical node in China’s strategy for engaging with and investing in Europe over the past decade, Fosun and other companies’ ability to align with that geopolitical objective set the stage for some of the largest Chinese investments in the continent. Moreover, this occurred even as other private sector conglomerates were being pressured to divest a range of assets throughout the world, thanks to the CCP’s efforts to contain outbound spending and reduce those companies’ overall debt loads and related systemic debt risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study proceeds in four chapters. The first chapter outlines the initial Chinese foray into Portugal as SOEs, and notably Fosun, played a key role in bailing out the country on the back of the European debt crisis that erupted in 2010. Importantly, these initial investments from 2011 to 2014 largely took place within the more well-known China Inc. model, whereby SOEs (primarily) invested in a foreign country to directly, and to a large extent overtly, support China’s geopolitical aims. However, these initial investments, particularly by Fosun, laid the groundwork for the more complex CCP Inc. ecosystem to deepen its presence within Portugal in the following years, especially as the importance of the Portuguese market and Sino-Portuguese relations became a linchpin in China’s Europe strategy amid increasing Sino-European tensions and European skepticism toward the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second chapter of this study examines the ways in which Fosun, in particular, used its initial investment in the Portuguese financial sector, a key element of China’s bailout of Portugal, to pave the way for additional Chinese investment and relationships within the sector. Through this investment, Fosun increasingly became part of a wider network of Chinese companies operating in the market while bolstering commercial and diplomatic ties with a key European partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third chapter steps back to examine the wider context in which Fosun’s investments took place. Key to this context was a concerted, protracted effort by senior Chinese officials to gain better control over outbound private sector spending, shore up financial stability, and ensure much closer alignment between private sector business operations and strategic objectives of the party-state. Private sector alignment is a key element of the CCP Inc. model, and Fosun’s ability to continue operating successfully within this narrower scope for maneuver not only epitomizes the CCP Inc. model at work but also underscores the pitfalls for nominally private Chinese companies of stepping outside of the CCP Inc. framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final chapter of this report concludes by highlighting the elements of Fosun’s use of the CCP Inc. model, via its two key Portuguese subsidiaries, to leverage its presence within the Portuguese financial sector to support China’s wider geopolitical and global commercial aims throughout Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies began investing heavily in Portugal in 2011, when the country was facing mounting economic headwinds thanks to a decade of lackluster economic performance and associated debt accumulation, the lingering effects of the 2007–08 global financial crisis, and the subsequent debt crisis that metastasized throughout Europe in 2010–13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country’s challenges culminated in a €78 billion ($104 billion) economic bailout program lasting from 2011 to 2014 that was initiated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in conjunction with the European Central Bank (ECB) and European Commission, the three of which would colloquially come to be referred to as “the troika.” These funds provided to Portugal by the troika were part of the group’s wider European bailout program that ultimately amounted to close to €500 billion ($667 billion) and included a wide range of countries, most notably Greece, Ireland, Spain, Hungary, and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The troika’s key stipulations around its bailout program for Portugal included the need for the Portuguese government to lower public debt and spending, introduce structural economic reforms, and privatize certain national assets, including stakes in national power companies. Additionally, Portugal’s domestic banks had significant exposure to the country’s economic challenges, which set the stage for Chinese companies — and Fosun in particular — to invest in state-owned assets in the financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, as part of the bailout, the Portuguese government opted to raise funds through the sale of stakes in electric utility company Energias de Portugal (EDP), grid operator Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN), and Caixa Seguros e Saúde, the insurance arm of Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD), Portugal’s largest state bank. At the time, Caixa Seguros e Saúde enjoyed a 26 percent market share in the insurance sector, making it the country’s largest insurance group. Three major subsidiaries were at the core of the group: Fidelidade, Portugal’s largest insurer, health insurer Multicare, and travel and transport insurer Cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese SOEs stepped in to undertake investments in the Portuguese power sector, and in late 2011, Portugal completed the sale of a 22 percent stake in EDP to the China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG) [中国长江三峡集团] for €2.7 billion ($3.8 billion), making the Chinese SOE the utility company’s largest shareholder. Months later, the State Grid Corporation of China [国家电网] purchased a 25 percent stake in power company REN for €390 million ($543 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government’s backing of these deals, and strong interest in pushing forward a commercial and bilateral relationship with Portugal at the time, was underscored by the premium that CTG offered on the EDP investment. The Chinese SOE outbid other interested parties by offering to purchase its stake in the Portuguese utility company at a 53 percent markup on EDP’s share prices at the time, bringing in an unexpectedly large revenue windfall for the embattled Portuguese government. This revenue generation was particularly important given the troika’s requirement that the Portuguese government raise at least €5.5 billion ($7.7 billion) via asset sales during the period of the bailout program. That goal would be aided considerably by Fosun’s €1 billion ($1.39 billion) investment in Caixa Seguros e Saúde, which is more commonly referred to by the brand name of its key subsidiary, Fidelidade, the largest and most important subsidiary of the group. Ultimately, the Chinese asset purchases detailed above would account for over 70 percent of the revenue generation requirements put in place by the troika around Portugal’s bailout program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the economic bailout program from the IMF, ECB, and European Commission progressed, Portuguese authorities began the process of undertaking an equity sale in Caixa Seguros e Saúde throughout 2013. Lisbon contacted 66 potential investors and received five preliminary offers for the insurance group. Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Limited was one of two bidders selected to provide a final proposal, with the U.S. private equity firm Apollo Global Management tendering the other final offer. Fosun would go on to successfully win the bid and acquire an 80 percent stake in Fidelidade, Multicare, and Cares for €1 billion ($1.3 billion). Fosun’s financial adviser, Morgan Stanley, said the deal, which was financed in part by the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), was the largest acquisition between Chinese and European financial institutions since 2008. Importantly, Manuel Rodrigues, Portugal’s secretary of state for finance, said that Fosun won the deal over Apollo not only because of a better financial offer but also because Fosun promised it would not break up the insurer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal enabled Fosun to become the only major private sector Chinese player to participate in Portugal’s bailout. However, the deal progressed with clear backing at the highest levels of the Chinese party-state, with Chinese president Xi Jinping and Portuguese president Aníbal Cavaco Silva both on hand to witness the official closing of deal in Beijing in May 2014. According to Fosun, the deal also marked the first major outbound investment of a Chinese firm to acquire a foreign insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This investment ultimately laid the groundwork for Fosun to further deepen its presence in the Portuguese financial sector and also set up future key investments in the sector by other Chinese players, namely state-owned UnionPay [中国银联], in 2018. It also further widened the reach of Chinese players in the power sector and enabled a foray into the Portuguese healthcare sector, among other key industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, later in 2014, Fosun joined state-owned State Grid Corporation of China as an investor in the Portuguese grid operator REN by purchasing a 3.97 percent stake in the company. Later that year, through its newly acquired Fidelidade subsidiary, Fosun acquired a 96.07 percent stake in healthcare services provider Espírito Santo Saúde – SGPS, SA, which owned one of the largest private hospitals in Lisbon, Hospital da Luz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this period, Fosun clearly indicated the strategic nature of its investments in Portugal as an anchor through which to pursue investments throughout Europe. In the press release announcing its acquisition of Espírito Santo Saúde, for example, Fosun directly stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Portugal is a very important market for Fosun and a strategic destination in Fosun’s global investment footprint. Fosun aspires to anchor from Portugal to seek and identify different investment opportunities within Portugal and in other parts of Europe, covering industries including real estate, leisure travel, healthcare, and consumer sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While such an approach would seem to be justified in terms of the company’s business strategy toward the European market, the approach paralleled a similar tack by Chinese officialdom. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs highlighted this approach after a 2013 meeting between then-foreign minister Yang Jiechi and Portuguese minister of state and foreign minister Paulo Portas, underscoring that Portas “welcomed more Chinese enterprises to invest in Portugal, noting that Portugal is willing to further advance the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership and thereby promote the comprehensive development of EU-China ties.” This approach by Fosun similarly parallels that of Chinese SOE investments in Portugal, with CTG’s investment in EDP being undertaken in large part as an effort by the Chinese company to gain a foothold in the wider European renewable energy market — a goal that would be further underscored by CTG’s 2018 attempt to take full ownership of EDP and its renewable energy subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wider strategic push by Chinese authorities and companies into the Portuguese market is highlighted by the fact that overall Chinese foreign direct investment in Portugal went from virtually zero in 2010 to €5.7 billion ($6.3 billion) by the end of 2016, with Fosun playing a critical role in some of the largest investments during this period, most notably in the financial services sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this study details, Fosun’s ongoing ability to deepen its investment presence within Portugal throughout this period was due in significant part to the company’s recognition of and integration into the evolving CCP Inc. model of outbound investment, especially as it was crystalizing in 2017–18. As such, the company’s direct connections — including through its leadership — to different elements of the CCP are important to note, as such associations work to reinforce alignment between official party and state bodies and private sector actors in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Fosun’s founder and chairman, Guo Guangchang, has long-standing connections to various CCP institutions. Guo was a member of the 10th and 11th National People’s Congresses — China’s legislature — which ran from 2003 to 2008 and 2008 to 2013, respectively. He was also a member of the 9th (1998–2003) and 12th (2013–2018) National Committees of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference — China’s top political advisory body, which has a remit to undertake so-called United Front work to ensure alignment between the CCP and non-CCP groups, including the private sector. Guo is also a current member of the standing committee of the All-China Youth Federation, a CCP-led body affiliated with, among other groups, the Communist Youth League of China, a key power base of former CCP general secretaries Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao as well as the current premier, Li Keqiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Guo, Fosun’s board features several other members with connections to the party-state. Co-CEO and executive director Chen Qiyu, for instance, was a member of the 12th and 13th standing committees of the Shanghai Municipal People’s Consultative Conference. Another co-CEO and executive director, Xu Xiaoliang, is a member of the Shanghai Youth Federation, Shanghai’s local chapter of the All-China Youth Federation. Meanwhile, non-executive director Zhang Shengman was previously a deputy director at the Ministry of Finance, and non-executive director Zhang Huaqiao is a former People’s Bank of China official and former non-executive director of the state-owned Sinopec Oilfield Service Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a handful of the key public affiliations that Fosun’s leadership has, or previously had, with institutions within the party-state system. And while such affiliations are not unusual among Chinese private sector executives, such associations and relationships could only have helped in Fosun’s successful navigation of and alignment within the CCP Inc. ecosystem in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Fosun was well placed to play a key role in China’s strategic expansion within the Portuguese financial sector, for a range of reasons. As the next chapters of this study detail, the company was able to deftly execute that expansion — not only to its own advantage, but also in a way that enabled other Chinese entities, notably some key state-owned financial institutions, to deepen their presence within the country throughout the years following the initial bailout program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fosun-and-ccp-incs-growing-presence-in-the-portuguese-financial-sector&quot;&gt;Fosun and CCP Inc.’s Growing Presence in the Portuguese Financial Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fosun’s initial investment in Fidelidade established a foundation through which the company would deepen its own ties, and widen the CCP Inc. network, within the Portuguese financial sector — as well as eventually act as a base of CCP Inc. connectivity throughout key BRI countries and Latin America. In coming years, these investments would enable deeper relationships for other Chinese SOEs, particularly UnionPay International and China Reinsurance Corporation (China Re), within Portugal, a process that continued to run in parallel to the wider CCP courting of Portugal as a key component in its strategy toward Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the initial Chinese bailout of Portugal, Fosun made one of its most critical investments when it purchased a sizable stake in Banco Comercial Português (BCP Millennium), Portugal’s largest private bank, in November 2016. Fosun signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with BCP Millennium to acquire a 16.67 percent stake for €174.6 billion ($193.2 billion) and signaled its intention to raise its stake to 30 percent over the years to come. The initial share purchase made the company BCP Millennium’s largest shareholder alongside Angolan state oil company Sonangol Group. Subsequently, Fosun acquired a 30 percent stake in multiple tranches over several years, upping its stake in the bank to 27 percent throughout 2017 and to 29.93 percent in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Fosun boosted its ownership of BCP Millennium, the bank also began to undertake a critical role in pushing forward Chinese commercial, policy, and geopolitical aims in Portugal. Critically, in May 2018, BCP Millennium acted as the intermediary for state-owned China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG) in its €9 billion ($10.6 billion) bid to take a controlling interest in utility company Energias de Portugal (EDP) as well as the company’s renewable energy arm, EDP Renováveis. CTG launched the bid as an all-cash tender offer for the outstanding shares that the Chinese SOE did not obtain in its 2011 investment in the company, looking to purchase the outstanding 76.7 percent at a 5 percent share-price premium over the €3.09 ($4.30) share price at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NJcn0T6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Fosun’s Evolving Ownership Stake in BCP Millennium over Time.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s research based on multiple sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CTG’s bid was of particular importance at that time: it not only represented a major new push by a Chinese SOE into the European renewable energy market, but it came at a time when Chinese foreign direct investment into Europe had become increasingly controversial. EDP shareholders, led by activist investment firm Elliott Investment Management, which held a 2.9 percent stake in EDP at the time, eventually blocked the bid, arguing that Fosun undervalued CTG and citing a shareholder voting rights reform requirement, included by CTG as part of the takeover bid, as too onerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, though, the potential transaction came in the wider context of increased Western skepticism around Chinese outbound investment and was under scrutiny from European and U.S. regulators. Indeed, the episode underscored a growing rift between Portuguese and other European governments over Chinese investment in Europe. Portugal’s then-prime minister António Costa indicated he had “no reservations” around the proposed takeover, even as German, French, and Italian regulators had moved to push forward a draft EU screening framework for investment into the bloc that would give EU regulators in Brussels the ability to weigh in on investments deemed “likely to affect security or public order in one or more member states.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ultimately unsuccessful, BCP Millennium’s participation — and by extension Fosun’s participation — in facilitating the offer on behalf of CTG highlights a key example of the CCP Inc. ecosystem at work. The foothold of the nominally private Chinese company in the Portuguese financial sector was key to allowing CTG to push the bid forward. It reflected not only an effort to expand the reach of CCP Inc. into the Portuguese economy but also an attempt to further China’s foreign policy aims by boosting its presence in the European renewable energy market and trying to circumvent growing European skepticism toward Chinese investment in strategic European assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even as CTG’s takeover attempt faltered, BCP Millennium continued to act as a key conduit for a deepening Chinese presence in the Portuguese financial sector and the wider Portuguese economy. Indeed, throughout 2018, the bank’s ties to a number of Chinese financial institutions, and within Chinese financial markets, grew rapidly. In May of that year, BCP Millennium re-signed an MoU in Beijing with Chinese state-owned lender ICBC — one of the underwriters of Fosun’s initial Fidelidade investment in 2014 — which had initially been drawn up in 2010. BCP Millennium’s explicitly stated intention, and that of its major shareholder, Fosun International, in re-signing the MoU was to leverage the relationship to deepen economic ties between China and Portugal, using the latter as a key launching pad for deepening these same ties in Europe and Portuguese-speaking African countries. Indeed, the press statement accompanying the MoU signing stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[BCP Millennium] remains committed to being a relevant part of an international business platform between China/Macao, Portuguese speaking countries — namely in Africa — and Europe, in order to support trade activity and investment flows in those geographies . . . taking advantage of ICBC’s regional presence and influence as well as other potential synergies in cooperation with the bank’s principal shareholder, Fosun International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, BCP Millennium signed an agreement in June 2018 to conduct renminbi clearing and settlement with the Bank of China Macao, which “reinforced the bank’s presence in the Chinese market” as it became “the first bank in Portugal to be considered a participating bank with access to Macao’s payments system.” Importantly, the Bank of China had been another major underwriter of Fosun’s initial Fidelidade investment, underscoring the long-standing relationship between Fosun, its Portuguese subsidiaries, and the Chinese lender. That same month, BCP Millennium officially signed an agreement with Alipay (the payment arm of China’s fintech giant Ant Group), pursuant to a March 2018 MoU, which allowed it to become the first bank to facilitate transactions between Portuguese merchants and Chinese travelers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most notably, in December 2018, BCP Millennium signed an agreement with UnionPay International — a subsidiary of the state-owned payments provider China UnionPay — to become the first European bank to issue UnionPay bank cards, marking a major overseas expansion for the Chinese SOE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BCP Millennium agreement with UnionPay marked a particularly exceptional example of the CCP Inc. ecosystem in action. Not only did the agreement offer UnionPay — officially the largest global issuer of bank cards at the time but with little presence in the European Union — a key foothold in the European market, the deal also further underscored BCP Millennium’s place as a key touch point for a range of Chinese financial and non-financial institutions in Portugal. The unique placement of BCP Millennium as a key player in the Sino-Portuguese relationship was underscored in no uncertain terms by the fact that the deal with UnionPay International was signed as part of a state visit by Xi Jinping to Portugal in late 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the trip, Xi Jinping and Portuguese prime minister António Costa signed several bilateral cooperation agreements, including a formal agreement for Portugal to sign onto the BRI. These agreements were paired with an additional announcement of 17 key commercial agreements in the areas of infrastructure, finance, automobiles, and science and technology, including the UnionPay International deal with BCP Millennium. Other key deals inked at the ceremony included a memorandum between telecommunications company Altice Portugal (formerly known as Portugal Telecom) and Huawei Technologies Company to strengthen cooperation on 5G frequency band licenses and an agreement to establish the STARlab project — a joint space and maritime technology laboratory between the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Portuguese aerospace and defense company Tekever, and Portugal’s Centre for Product Engineering and Development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the international subsidiary of the state-owned China Oil and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO) signed an agreement with the Portuguese Trade and Investment Agency to establish the COFCO International Centre of Excellence for corporate shared services. Following the deal, the chairman and CEO of COFCO International stated that “Portugal’s positive approach towards international business, skilled human resources and strategic location were the main reasons for choosing Portugal over several other candidate locations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signing of the BCP Millennium agreement with UnionPay alongside such obviously important strategic agreements in the areas of technological infrastructure, aerospace and maritime research, and agribusiness underscores both the high-level Chinese government backing for the financial sector cooperation as well as its own strategic importance. Indeed, during a meeting with Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa on the same state visit, Xi highlighted China’s strategic approach to the bilateral relationship with Portugal by saying that “as a member of the European Union, Portugal has huge influence on Africa and many Portuguese-speaking countries, and is a key link in China’s economic internationalization strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its part, Fosun International indicated that the BCP Millennium tie-up with UnionPay International, first floated in late 2017, was a major milestone in the company’s push to “promote the synergy of various sectors such as banking, insurance, and health” within Portugal as the company moved to “fully mobilize resources to promote outstanding domestic [Chinese] financial enterprises, [including] . . . [the] Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China UnionPay, the China-Africa Fund, [and] the China-Portugal Fund.” Additionally, Fosun leadership indicated that “together with BCP, [the company would] help Chinese enterprises to go global, and jointly carry out cooperation in payments, investment, loan business, and other aspects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s 2018 state visit to Portugal, and the wide array of commercial deals and relationships connected to that visit, represent a snapshot of CCP Inc. in action. While high-level state visits are used by many countries to help reinforce commercial ties, the highly strategic nature of each of the deals that were signed on Xi’s Portugal trip speaks to a more fundamental alignment between CCP strategic objectives and Chinese commercial interests abroad. It further underscores the incentives of a range of companies — including BCP Millennium’s Chinese parent, Fosun — to support official efforts to cement Portugal as a critical partner on the European continent and as a potential launching pad into the wider region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;critical-context-of-fosuns-success-with-bcp-millennium&quot;&gt;Critical Context of Fosun’s Success with BCP Millennium&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fosun and BCP Millennium’s success in enabling a wider CCP Inc. network of investment into Portugal is particularly notable considering that it came at a time when outbound investment by other private sector Chinese conglomerates was being actively reined in by Chinese authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2017, Chinese officials had become increasingly concerned about soaring rates of outbound investment over the previous several years. For example, Vice Premier Liu He commissioned a study to examine the economic vulnerabilities created by such large outbound flows of direct investment, particularly in light of the role such investment played in bursting Japan’s economic bubble in the 1990s. According to media reports, the study included a recommendation to gain greater control over, and reduce the scale of, outbound investment by some of China’s largest private sector companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the topic of outbound investment, and its potential role in destabilizing the domestic financial system, reportedly emerged as a key topic of discussion at an April 2017 Politburo meeting. Importantly, China’s 25-member Politburo typically discusses key economic policy priorities at its monthly meetings once a quarter, in January, April, July, and October. And while the official readouts of the Politburo meeting and Politburo study session from that month do not explicitly mention the goal of reducing outbound spending by Chinese companies, they focus intensely on senior Chinese policymakers’ clear concern about reducing financial system volatility and instability, including vulnerabilities and potential spillover effects created by the Chinese financial system’s growing linkages with the global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, in the readout of the Politburo study session on financial security on April 26, 2017, Xi clearly stated that “financial security is an important part of national security and an important foundation for the stable and healthy development of the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8WC9zxj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 9: Overall Chinese Outbound Investment 2010–2020.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://fec.mofcom.gov.cn/article/tjsj/tjgb/&quot;&gt;“走出去”公共服务平台 [“Going Out” Public Service Bulletin], 中华人民共和国商务部 [Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China], accessed November 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These key Politburo meetings would ultimately set the stage for a prolonged, multiyear effort to de-risk the domestic Chinese financial system, part of which involved a crackdown on foreign and domestic financial activities by some of China’s largest private sector conglomerates, including the HNA Group, Dalian Wanda Group, Anbang Insurance Group, and Fosun Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the crackdown on outbound investment deals, these four companies alone accounted for a whopping $57 billion in outbound spending from 2015 to mid-2017, representing a full 15 percent of all outbound spending by Chinese companies during this period. In June 2017, financial authorities specifically requested reports from banks on the overseas loans made to each of these companies, and over the following several years, scrutiny of the companies’ financial positions, and specifically their overseas spending and assets, ramped up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the State Council released a key set of opinions in August 2017 to codify and tighten the previously disparate rules around outbound investment by laying out specific areas of overseas direct investment that were encouraged, restricted, and prohibited. Encouraged investment areas included those in the services sector, in technology that would help to move China up the value chain, and for projects under the umbrella of the BRI. Restricted investment areas included real estate, hotels, cinemas, entertainment, sports clubs, and “investment platforms without specific industrial projects.” Meanwhile, prohibited investment areas included “investment involving the production of core technologies and products of the military” or “investments that endanger or may endanger the interests of the state” — a broad umbrella under which Xi had placed financial system stability just months before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the following several years, the four major private sector conglomerates that had been singled out by authorities for renewed scrutiny, including Fosun, would see a range of regulatory outcomes in terms of their ability to maintain and expand their respective portfolios of overseas assets, a process that further highlighted some key aspects of the emerging CCP Inc. framework at that time. Core among these was the need for nominally private sector entities to more clearly align with national strategic objectives in undertaking outbound spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this context, then, it is notable that Fosun was able to continue deepening its ties in the Portuguese financial sector, through its Fidelidade subsidiary and related investment in BCP Millennium, over the course of 2017 and 2018. Indeed, of the four conglomerates that came under Beijing’s scrutiny, Fosun has seen by far the best regulatory outcomes and clearly maneuvered to get back into the good graces of senior policymakers. By comparison, Anbang Insurance Group (安邦保险集团) was taken over by the government in February 2018. The company’s non-core assets were wound down over the following three-year period of government receivership, and its founder and chairman, Wu Xiaohui, was handed an 18-year prison sentence for fraud. Meanwhile, on the very same day that Anbang’s government takeover was announced, Fosun announced plans to purchase a controlling interest in one of France’s oldest fashion design companies. For its part, HNA Group [海航集团] has been placed into bankruptcy and taken over by provincial authorities, while its chairman and CEO were both detained by authorities on suspicion of crimes in late 2021. Finally, Dalian Wanda’s [万达集团] overseas asset base is now a fraction of its peak, as the company shed assets amounting to $19.2 billion between mid-2017 and early 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fosun’s success in navigating the regulatory crackdown, especially in comparison to its highly chastened peers, can be explained in part by the clear alignment between its investments in Portugal and Chinese policymakers’ objectives to leverage commercial and diplomatic relations with the country as an avenue for deepening commercial engagement and investment in Europe more broadly as well as to cultivate a key ally in mitigating rising European skepticism toward Chinese investment. Indeed, as internal concern around capital outflows via unruly overseas direct investment was beginning to percolate among the Chinese leadership in late 2016, Xi called directly for more Chinese investment in Portugal, going so far as to say that China would encourage expansion in areas including finance, insurance, and healthcare — areas in which Fosun was already the leading Chinese player in the country through its investments in Fidelidade and BCP Millennium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the government’s crackdown on outbound investment and high debt levels among China’s private sector conglomerates moved forward, Fosun’s domestic messaging within China also began to align more closely with CCP and Chinese state priorities. As soon as July 2017, Fosun chairman Guo Guangchang began to publicly support Beijing’s tougher rules on overseas investments, citing a reduction in potential risks to financial security as one element of his support of the eradication of irrational outbound investment. Guo’s clear and public alignment with the new outbound investment framework, and his company’s subsequent ability to operate successfully within it, is particularly notable given the fates of the Anbang and HNA chairmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this alignment came not only on the back of the crackdown on overseas spending but also after Guo had previously been caught up in Xi’s sweeping anti-corruption crackdown on the financial sector. In late 2015, Guo was among several high-profile private sector Chinese executives that were subjected to anti-corruption investigations and temporarily went missing from public view. On December 10, 2015, local financial media reported that Fosun executives had been unable to reach Guo since noon that day. Guo’s sudden disappearance ultimately led to a brief suspension of trading for Fosun International shares on the Hong Kong exchange before he resurfaced on December 14, saying he had been assisting judicial authorities in their investigations but offering no further details. Some observers speculated that Guo’s detainment was related to his relationship with Yao Gang, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or Ai Baojun, vice mayor of Shanghai, both of whom were under investigation by anti-corruption authorities at the time. Such an experience may have heightened Guo’s political sensitivity and helped him shepherd Fosun successfully through the evolution of the CCP Inc. ecosystem in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, after the crackdown on outbound spending, Fosun International began to more explicitly tie its outbound investment efforts to support of the BRI, with co-CEO Xu Xiaoliang saying in September 2017, just weeks after the release of the State Council’s opinions on outbound investment, that “now that we know what the government encourages and discourages, we have a clearer idea of where to expand our global footprint.” Guo further highlighted this point in a 2018 interview, stating: “Our overseas investments are approved by the Chinese government and the local governments, not just in Europe but globally” and “The Chinese government . . . support[s] the companies who respect the law.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3uXqOOW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 10: Timeline of the Regulatory Crackdown on Outward Direct Investment.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s research based on multiple sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short order, these increased efforts at public alignment with the CCP’s enhanced oversight of outbound spending by nominally private sector Chinese conglomerates were overtly recognized. In December 2017, the CCP’s official mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, went so far as to publicly praise Fosun’s outbound investment activities in an op-ed, juxtaposing those efforts directly against other Chinese companies that had failed to realign to the emerging CCP Inc. model of outbound investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article highlighted the achievements of China’s ongoing investment presence beyond its borders, arguing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Behind the dazzling achievements, some enterprises take advantage of the “going out” strategy to strengthen and refine their brands; however, some are involved in undesirable foreign investment behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article went on to call out Fosun’s investment in BCP Millennium as a model for other companies to emulate, highlighting the initial groundwork that the tie-up was already laying for UnionPay to expand in Europe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Recently, BCP [Millennium], which has Fosun as an investor, reached a strategic cooperation agreement with UnionPay to jointly carry out UnionPay card issuance, innovative payment promotion, and other cooperation in Europe. This exemplifies Fosun’s successful practice of helping the Belt and Road Initiative and Chinese enterprises with their global layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the article hit home the point that outbound investment by a range of Chinese companies can only succeed within the framework of overt policy support, stating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Steady and positive “going out” is not possible without policy support and guidance. In the face of the excessively rapid growth of outbound foreign investment in fields such as real estate, hotels, cinemas, entertainment, and sports clubs in recent years, relevant regulatory authorities have provided risk warnings and adopted a series of policy measures. According to Guo Guangchang, chairman of Fosun International, “Capable government ensures effective markets. Stable, predictable, more transparent, and fairer policies can support real and legal foreign investment in line with the national strategy, which guarantees long-term and healthy development of companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clear realignment of Fosun within the parameters of the CCP Inc. model not only allowed the company to gain high-level backing for its ongoing investments in the Portuguese financial sector throughout 2017 and 2018 but also underpinned increasing ties between Fosun-invested Portuguese companies and other major Chinese financial players along the BRI and into a wider range of international markets over the following years, as the next chapter of this report explores. Moreover, the ability of Fosun to continue operating within Europe and to deepen its ties — and those of the wider CCP Inc. ecosystem — is even more striking when considering the outcome of similar investments by the other nominally private sector Chinese conglomerates during this period of enhanced scrutiny. Most notable in this regard is the fate of HNA Group’s 2017 investment in Germany’s Deutsche Bank AG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a move similar to that of Fosun’s investments in Fidelidade and BCP Millennium, HNA Group bought stakes in Deutsche Bank in February and March 2017, becoming one of the bank’s largest shareholders, with a 4.8 percent stake, worth just over €1 billion ($1.13 billion). Then, in May 2017, just around the time that Fosun was increasing its stake in BCP Millennium, HNA went on to boost its investment in Deutsche Bank further, ultimately taking on a near 10 percent stake in the German lender, making the Chinese conglomerate its largest shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parallels between the HNA and Fosun investments in key European financial players are particularly notable, not only for their similar timing but also given that HNA’s investment came as the German lender was struggling under the weight of an array of regulatory penalties and poor investment decisions from 2013 to 2016, requiring infusions of outside capital to help steady the bank in 2016 and 2017. These dynamics were similar to the challenges faced by a range of Portuguese financial institutions in the wake of the European debt crisis, which opened the door for the initial Fosun investment in Fidelidade and later BCP Millennium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sg4CMvZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 11: Selected Major Overseas Investments by HNA 2015–2017.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s research based on multiple sources cited throughout this report and others. Please reference the endnotes for complete additional citations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the ultimate fate of Fosun’s investments in Portugal could not have been more starkly different than that of HNA’s investment in Deutsche Bank. Indeed, rather than utilizing its position as a key shareholder in the German lender to enable a growing presence of the CCP Inc. ecosystem within the German economy and financial sector, as Fosun was able to achieve in Portugal, HNA quickly made an about-face on its German investment, selling down its stake to 8.8 percent in February 2018 and losing its status as the firm’s largest shareholder after less than a year in that position. While this initial paring of HNA’s stake in Deutsche Bank was widely attributed to the need to raise capital in order to address liquidity issues that the Chinese conglomerate was facing in early 2018, the company continued to sell off its stake in the coming years as Chinese officials demanded that the company wind down its non-core business lines and assets. Ultimately, HNA was effectively taken over by the provincial government of Hainan, where the group is based, which began the process of restructuring the group in late 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The juxtaposition of HNA’s failed overseas investments, as well as the forced spin-off of its foreign assets and its ultimate takeover by local authorities, against the ongoing flourishing of Fosun’s overseas expansion throughout this period throws into stark relief just how successful the latter company was in both recognizing and aligning with the rapid evolution of the CCP Inc. model during the 2017–18 time period. Fosun’s public and high-profile alignment with the concerted regulatory push to fully align overseas spending tightly with CCP and Chinese state strategic objectives was a critical element in its continued success investing abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Fosun’s overt drive to leverage its investments and business relationships in Portugal to open additional overseas business opportunities for a range of Chinese state and private companies — both within and beyond the financial sector — speaks to a clear recognition of the importance of the ecosystem aspect of the CCP Inc. model. Indeed, in this model the outbound spending and foreign commercial presence of a given company is not simply meant to boost that company’s bottom line, nor even to solely support China’s diplomatic and strategic objectives abroad. Importantly, such investments are also meant to boost commercial opportunities for other Chinese players in overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, Chinese companies — both state-owned and nominally private — can swim in the wake of other Chinese companies’ success in penetrating foreign markets, and the relationships between these companies work to reinforce China’s overall foreign commercial presence. The People’s Daily article praising Fosun’s efforts to open a pathway for UnionPay International’s expansion in Europe makes this point explicit, and Fosun would go on to further internalize and execute on this element of the CCP Inc. model in future overseas operations alongside other key Chinese SOEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-on-success&quot;&gt;Building on Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fidelidade’s Presence beyond Portugal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the increased scrutiny of outbound investment by nominally private Chinese companies in 2017, Fosun continued to deepen the alignment between its global investment portfolio and China’s national objectives, further integrating into the CCP Inc. model in the process. Another key tie-up came in 2019 when Fosun’s Fidelidade subsidiary entered into a strategic partnership with China Reinsurance Corporation (China Re) [中国再保险] to provide project financing and reinsurance for the BRI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with Fosun’s moves to align both messaging and investments with CCP priorities, the agreement was signed in April 2019 in Beijing at the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, a gathering that was widely seen as core to furthering China’s geopolitical and global commercial objectives at the time by seeking to redefine the BRI against growing global critiques of the effort. The initiative’s growing reputation as environmentally unfriendly, corrupt, and debt-fueled had led Chinese leadership to seek to recast the effort. This push fit within officials’ wider efforts to gain greater control over outbound spending as they sought “to exert more control over the program . . . including [with] clearer rules for state-owned-enterprises, restricting use of the BRI brand, and building overseas auditing and anti-corruption mechanisms.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping chaired the forum, which was attended by thousands of participants, many from the foreign business community, and dozens of foreign heads of state. Xi held a spate of bilateral meetings as part of the forum, including talks with President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa of Portugal, where Xi characterized the bilateral relationship as one of “prominent strategic significance, high complementarity in interests, and strong economic complementarity.” The readout of the meeting further underscored China’s view of Portugal as a key channel for stabilizing and improving broader relations with Europe, saying “it is believed that the Portuguese side will also continue to play an active role in maintaining the right direction of China-Europe relations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inking the Fidelidade partnership with China Re at the forum, therefore, worked to boost the prominence of the agreement, which was listed by Chinese state media as one of 17 key investment projects announced at the gathering. Reporting around the agreement further indicated that the primary area of focus for the partnership would be to enhance “reinsurance solutions for projects in Portugal, Spain, France, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde and Peru.” For its part, Fidelidade expressly stated that the partnership with this important SOE, the only state-owned reinsurer in China, would enable the Fosun-owned group to widen its reach throughout various geographies to “diversify its scope and develop new opportunities for international business growth, bolstering its offer to the Chinese community around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, China Re’s publicity around the agreement further underscored that it would help to unlock new investment opportunities within China and around the world for Fidelidade, saying: “The two sides will also seek opportunities for cooperation in the construction of the Greater Bay Area of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, especially to exert the influence of Fidelidade Insurance Group of Portugal in Portuguese-speaking countries and provide professional services for Macao to exploit markets of Portuguese-speaking countries.” In addition, linked to the Fideldidade-China Re strategic cooperation was a separate effort between China and Angola to enact a strategic cooperation agreement with Fidelidade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the establishment of its partnership with China Re appears to have been the marquee agreement that Fidelidade undertook in 2019, Fosun was simultaneously expanding its presence in a range of other markets around the world through its Fidelidade subsidiary with the express purpose of offering insurance support to Chinese projects, most notably throughout Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That year, Fidelidade announced it would sell insurance in Chile “through a series of partnership agreements. Elsewhere in South America, the Portuguese company acquired 51 percent of Peruvian insurer La Positiva Seguros y Reaseguros, through its local subsidiary, and purchased an almost one-fourth ownership of Alianza Compañía de Seguros y Reaseguros in Bolivia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These investments were undertaken within the context of specific Chinese policies to leverage the insurance sector to support and stabilize a range of investment activities in Latin America, as emphasized in a January 2022 report on Chinese insurers in Latin America from the Inter-American Dialogue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s top planners have noted the importance of enhanced insurance support for the country’s overseas operations in recent five-year plans and in policies toward Latin America. China’s 1+3+6 Cooperative Framework, introduced to the region by Xi Jinping in 2015, is among the Latin America-specific policies intended to boost funds, credit loans, and insurance to the region — in this case for project development in logistics, electricity, and information technology. . . . As Zhu Junsheng, deputy director of the Insurance Research Office of the Financial Research Institute of the Development Research Center of the State Council noted, Chinese infrastructure firms, insurers, and other actors are expected to increasingly work together to identify high-quality overseas projects and ‘increase the attractiveness of infrastructure projects to market funds.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These deepening investments and relationships, in both Latin America and BRI countries, that Fosun has pursued in recent years via its Fidelidade subsidiary show the ongoing and intensifying alignment of Fosun’s global commercial objectives with Chinese geopolitical and strategic interests. Additionally, the ever-growing roster of key SOE financial players with which Fosun and Fidelidade are partnering in these endeavors further highlights Fosun’s ability to leverage the CCP Inc. ecosystem to its advantage. That is especially true considering that over the past several years senior Chinese officials, including Xi Jinping, have repeatedly stated their view that the Portuguese relationship and market should be seen as a critical anchor for China’s growing commercial and diplomatic presence around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of Chinese-invested companies such as Fidelidade and BCP Millennium to leverage their relationships with Chinese SOEs to expand into a wide range of markets around the world is a core component of the CCP Inc. ecosystem. Such cooperation allows for a wider array of relationship building, networking, and financial and policy support than any one company could achieve on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally as important, Fosun’s maneuvering to embed itself within the Portuguese financial sector through high-profile, strategic investments has allowed the company to act as one of the key anchors in the wider CCP Inc. approach to the Portuguese market. Indeed, the fact that this nominally private company worked to boost the presence of key state-owned actors within Portugal — including the China Three Gorges Corporation, UnionPay, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and the Bank of China — rather than the other way around, speaks to the essence of the shift from “China Inc.” to “CCP Inc.” that has taken place in recent years and is ongoing today. Moreover, Fosun’s maneuvering to buoy the strategic national objective of developing commercial and diplomatic ties with Portugal as a jumping off point to pursue deeper engagement in European and other markets underscores how thoroughly the CCP has co-opted the Chinese private sector as the CCP Inc. model of economic governance has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this report has highlighted, these achievements are all the more remarkable given the fast-evolving nature of policies dictating outbound private sector Chinese investments at the time Fosun was pursuing its expansion into Portugal, especially in light of the failure of other private Chinese conglomerates to achieve similar alignment with national goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this case study not only highlights some of the crucial elements of the CCP Inc. model in action but also underscores the still-evolving nature of that model. As state-owned and nominally private Chinese companies continue to widen their investment footprints throughout the global economy, it will be critical for policymakers and business leaders in Western countries to deepen their understanding of the contours of the CCP Inc. ecosystem as it has evolved to date. But additionally, to compete against the CCP Inc. ecosystem going forward, Western countries must also seek to anticipate how the ecosystem will become further refined and design forward-looking global trade and investment regimes robust enough to meet the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) conducted significantly more extensive fixed-wing strike operations during the first days of the invasion than has been previously documented, while Ukrainian ground-based air-defence (GBAD) capabilities were suppressed by initial attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During this period, Ukrainian fighter aircraft inflicted some losses on VKS aircraft but also took serious casualties due to being totally technologically outmatched and badly outnumbered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian fighters have remained highly effective and lethal against Ukrainian aircraft near the frontlines throughout the war, especially the Su-35S with the R-77-1 long-range missile and, in recent months, the Mig-31BM with the R-37 very long-range missile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From early March, the VKS lost the ability to operate in Ukrainian-controlled airspace except at very low altitudes due to its inability to reliably suppress or destroy increasingly effective, well-dispersed and mobile Ukrainian surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian GBAD has also been highly effective since March, especially the long-range S-400 SAM system supported by the 48Ya6 ‘Podlet-K1’ all-altitude long-range surveillance radar system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Numerous MANPADS provided to Ukrainian troops and later mobile air-defence teams meant that low-altitude Russian fixed-wing and rotary penetrating sorties beyond the frontlines proved to be prohibitively costly during March, and ceased by April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout the war, most Russian airstrikes have been against pre-designated targets with unguided bombs and rockets. The Su-34 fleet has regularly also fired stand-off missiles such as the Kh-29 and Kh-59 against fixed targets, and Su-30SM and Su-35S fighters have regularly fired Kh-31P and Kh-58 anti-radiation missiles to suppress and target Ukrainian SAM radars.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without air superiority, Russia’s attempts at strategic air attack have been limited to expensive cruise and ballistic missile barrages at a much more limited scale. These failed to achieve strategically decisive damage during the first seven months of the invasion. However, the latest iteration is a more focused and sustainable bombardment of the Ukrainian electricity grid, blending hundreds of cheap Iranian-supplied Shahed-136 loitering munitions against substations with continued use of cruise and ballistic missiles against larger targets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The West must avoid complacency about the need to urgently bolster Ukrainian air-defence capacity. It is purely thanks to its failure to destroy Ukraine’s mobile SAM systems that Russia remains unable to effectively employ the potentially heavy and efficient aerial firepower of its fixed-wing bomber and multi-role fighter fleets to bombard Ukrainian strategic targets and frontline positions from medium altitude, as it did in Syria. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It follows that if Ukrainian SAMs are not resupplied with ammunition, and ultimately augmented and replaced with Western equivalents over time, the VKS will regain the ability to pose a major threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the short term, Ukraine also needs large numbers of additional man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS) and radar-guided anti-aircraft guns, such as the Gepard, to sustain and increase its ability to intercept the Shahed-136s and protect its remaining power infrastructure and repairs to damaged facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the medium term, Ukraine needs cost-effective ways to defend itself against the Shahed-136. One option could be compact radar and/or laser ranging and sighting systems to allow numerous existing anti-aircraft guns to be much more accurate and effective against them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian Air Force fighter force needs modern Western fighters and missiles to sustainably counter the VKS. Russian pilots have been cautious throughout the war, so even a small number of Western fighters could have a major deterrent effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any Western fighter supplied in the short–medium term needs to be capable of dispersed operations using mobile maintenance equipment and small support teams, and flying from relatively rough runways, to avoid being neutralised by Russian long-range missile strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, it initiated the first large-scale peer conflict in Europe since the Second World War. The stakes are extremely high, as the outcome of the war will define not only the future of Ukraine and of Russia, but also the global geopolitical system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, therefore, there has been an unprecedented degree of sustained global public, political, military and media interest driving external analysis of the war. Since the start of the invasion, military analysis in both public and professional communities has focused heavily on Russia’s employment of ground forces. This is logical since the Russian Ground Forces have done by far the most damage, possess most of Russia’s conventional firepower and are the most important component of Russian military capability. By contrast, Russian Aerospace Forces’ (VKS) fixed-wing and helicopter operations during the conflict have remained more sparsely documented and only partially understood outside those Ukrainian Air Force, Navy and Army personnel directly involved in countering their operations day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External analysts, including the lead author of this report, have so far focused on trying to explain the apparent absence of a large-scale air campaign or strategically significant results achieved by the VKS. The pervasive use by both sides of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) – usually called ‘drones’ – and UAVs – also usually called ‘drones’ – carrying modern cameras, and the ubiquitous presence of smartphones among troops, has ensured that detailed footage of the ground war has been captured and broadcast in unprecedented detail throughout the war. By contrast, the combat air environment is inherently much harder to film due to the speeds, distances and altitudes involved. Consequently, much of what is known about the air war over Ukraine has been gleaned from isolated clips filmed from the ground, and carefully selected footage collated and released by both the Ukrainian and Russian Ministries of Defence as part of information operations. Therefore, while analysts have been able to observe fragments of the air war, and to track competing kill/loss claims and count wreckage on both sides, there has so far been very little granular information available in the public domain about the actual Russian air war over Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report sets out to start the process of uncovering how Russia’s VKS has operated over Ukraine between the start of the invasion in February and late October 2022. It is based on fieldwork conducted in Ukraine in August and October 2022, which included interviews with Ukrainian Air Force officers working in both the aviation and air-defence branches, interviews with senior intelligence officers and military scientists, and examination of captured and recovered Russian weapons systems. To protect sources, the interview subjects have been anonymised and precise dates and locations are not disclosed. The interviews were, of necessity, conducted with Ukrainian officials and officers but not Russian ones and, consequently, they represent an incomplete view from only one side of the air war. To guard against over-reliance on single sources, most of the interviews were conducted with multiple individuals representing different parts of their services. Where possible, information has also been cross-referenced between different interviews, and also evaluated against externally available footage and existing open-source intelligence data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I provides details of the operations undertaken by the fixed-wing fighter, fighter-bomber and attack aircraft of the VKS. There were significant changes in objectives, tactics, operational intensity and weapons use at various phases of the war, so this chapter takes a chronological approach to explain their evolution over time. Chapter II examines Russian attack aviation (helicopter gunship) operations during the war. Chapter III examines the Russian long-range precision-strike campaign, looking at the patterns of use, targets and some characteristics of the cruise and ballistic missiles Russia has used to bombard Ukraine. It also provides some analysis of the Iranian-supplied Shahed-136 (called Geran-2 by Russia) loitering munitions (often inappropriately called ‘kamikaze drones’) that have been extensively used against Ukrainian infrastructure since September 2022. Finally, the report concludes with an analysis of the main priorities for aid that Ukraine needs from its international partners to improve its air-defence capabilities. There are several areas that are already becoming critical requirements if Ukraine is to sustain the battlefield momentum that it has won over Russia at such a devastating cost since February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report deliberately avoids giving detailed descriptions of Ukrainian air combat and ground-based air-defence (GBAD) tactics, operations and losses to protect Ukrainian operational security. As such, it does not attempt to give a comprehensive or final account of the air war, but rather to usefully increase Western understanding of the use of Russian airpower during the conflict within the bounds of what can be verified and publicly discussed at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-russian-fixed-wing-combat-operations&quot;&gt;I. Russian Fixed-Wing Combat Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE IMPACT OF hundreds of Russian cruise and ballistic missile strikes across Ukraine and the ill-fated air-assault operation at Hostomel Airport dominated the external view of Russian air operations during the initial week of the invasion. Ukrainian fast jets flew several visible combat air patrols (CAPs) over Kyiv and other cities, but various viral pieces of footage claiming to show air-to-air combat between Russian and Ukrainian jets were quickly recognisable as fakes created using commercial flight simulator software. This led several commentators, including the lead author of this paper, to put forward various theories for the apparent absence of VKS activity during the first week of the invasion. The VKS had deployed a fast-jet force of around 350 modern combat aircraft for operations in Ukraine; so the lack of a publicly visible air campaign came as a major surprise to most analysts. The tentative conclusions reached by this author in March about the lack of VKS capacity to mount complex, large-scale operations still hold today, but early analysis was wrong about the lack of significant Russian air activity in the early days of the war. This chapter explains how, in fact, the VKS mounted significant strike and offensive counter-air operations during this period, and the Ukrainian Air Force engaged in numerous air-to-air clashes to oppose it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first week of the invasion, Russian electronic warfare using jamming equipment and E-96M aerial decoys were highly effective in disrupting Ukrainian GBAD. S-300 and SA-11 ‘Buk’ radar-guided surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems were particularly badly affected in the north of the country, especially to the north of Kyiv along the Hostomel/Irpin and Chernihiv axes. Cruise and ballistic missile strikes had also damaged or destroyed multiple long-range early warning radars throughout the country, and destroyed various Ukrainian SAM sites in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in the south. The physical destruction, along with the electronic disruption and suppression of SAM systems in the north and northeast, left the Mikoyan Mig-29 and Sukhoi Su-27 fighters of the Ukrainian Air Force with the task of providing air defence over most of the country for the first few days of the war. The Ukrainian air defences progressively recovered as jammed and damaged radar systems were reset and assets were rapidly repositioned during the second and third days. After that, the Air Force and air defence infrastructures worked in tandem. Deconfliction between aircraft and GBAD was coordinated by time until 3 March, after which deconfliction began to be coordinated by space because of friendly fire incidents. In other words, SAM systems and combat aircraft sorties began to be deconflicted by being allocated separate operational areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ukrainian GBAD units were electronically degraded and trying to reorganise and recover from physical strikes, Russian GBAD units inside Ukraine were also suffering from major limitations. Mobile air-defence assets, such as the short-range SA-15 ‘Tor’ and medium-range SA-17 ‘Buk’, had been sent into Ukraine with no functional communications plan. They were also advancing out of sequence and often separated from the formations that they were supposed to protect; and they were operating under very restrictive rules of engagement which instructed them to assume anything flying was Russian. The inability of radar-guided SAMs on either side to perform as anticipated during the first week and a half meant that fixed-wing aircraft on both sides had remarkable freedom to penetrate significant distances across the rapidly changing frontlines. This would quickly cease to be the case from early March, when both sides’ GBAD reorganised and became far more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the invasion, Russian Sukhoi Su-34 ‘frontal bomber’ and Su-30SM and Su-35S multi-role fighter aircraft flew around 140 sorties per day, conducting fighter sweeps and strike sorties up to 300 km inside Ukrainian territory at altitudes of between 12,000 ft and 30,000 ft. During the first three days, the primary targets of these VKS strikes were Ukrainian air defences. Over 100 fixed long-range radar installations, bases, munitions storage sites and positions occupied by mobile long- and medium-range SAM systems were attacked, with Russian fixed-wing sorties concentrating their activities along the routes intended to be used by airborne and helicopter assault forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, all the medium- and high-level strikes were conducted against pre-designated locations that had been extensively mapped by Su-24MR reconnaissance bombers. The Ukrainian Air Force observed that the latter constantly flew two–four sorties per day at medium to high altitude along Ukraine’s borders from early February to the end of April. Su-34s carried out the bulk of the strikes with multiple unguided FAB-500 and OFAB-250 bombs, and, during the first week, typically operated at medium altitudes of around 12,000 ft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these medium-level daylight strikes were carried out by single aircraft, with fewer than 25% of strikes conducted by pairs or larger formations; and none were observed that involved more than six aircraft in a strike package. This contributed to inconsistent damage results as well as inefficient battle damage assessment (BDA), meaning that follow-up strikes were seldom carried out. Nevertheless, VKS fixed-wing air strikes were effective in the south, where, in conjunction with cruise and ballistic missiles, attacks badly degraded the limited Ukrainian Air Force and Naval air-defence capacity deployed in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. However, most of the targets hit were static radars and outdated S-125 (SA-3) SAM sites, and the only serious damage was to Ukrainian mobile SAM systems against trailer and truck-mounted S-300PS/PT units that either received too little warning to be able to move, or were stuck due to lack of spare parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian Su-35S and Su-30SM fighters flew numerous high-altitude CAPs at around 30,000 ft in support of the medium-altitude Russian strike aircraft operating widely during the first three days. They scored multiple air-to-air kills against Ukrainian Mig-29 and Su-27 fighters, as well as against low-flying Su-24 and Su-25 attack aircraft that were conducting strikes with unguided bombs and rockets against Russian military convoys on the Kyiv axes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian pilots confirm that Russia’s Su-30SM and Su-35S completely outclass Ukrainian Air Force fighter aircraft on a technical level. The long range and good look-down, shoot-down performance of their N011M Bars and N035 Irbis-E radars, and the much longer reach and active-radar guidance capability of the R-77-1 air-to-air missile compared with the semi-active R-27R/ER available to Ukrainian fighters, are the most important aspects of this technical overmatch. Throughout the war, Russian fighters have frequently been able to achieve a radar lock and launch R-77-1 missiles at Ukrainian fighters from over 100 km away. Even though such shots have a low probability of kill, they force Ukrainian pilots to go defensive or risk being hit while still far outside their own effective range, and a few such long-range shots found their mark. Furthermore, the R-77-1’s active radar seeker, combined with the modern N011M and N035 radars, give Russian fighters the ability to launch missiles in track-while-scan (TWS) mode, meaning that Ukrainian pilots are unlikely to get warning from their radar-warning receivers (RWRs) that they have been launched on until the missile itself goes active a few seconds before it hits. In contrast, the R-27R/ER missiles that Ukrainian fighters are armed with require a single target track (STT) lock to be maintained by the launching fighter’s own radar throughout a missile engagement. This means that Russian pilots receive an RWR warning when a Ukrainian pilot launches a radar-guided missile at them, and that if the Ukrainian fighter even briefly loses radar lock during missile flight, due to either side manoeuvring, deploying countermeasures or electronic warfare, then the missile will miss.&lt;/p&gt;

▲ Internal view of R-77-1 air-to-air missile section showing rear fin control actuators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This deeply unequal radar and missile performance compared with Russian fighters, as well as being tactically outnumbered by up to 15:2 in some cases, forced Ukrainian pilots to fly extremely low to try to exploit ground clutter and terrain masking to get close enough to fire before being engaged.30 This was still highly dangerous, and flying low further increased the range discrepancy between the effective ranges of Russian and Ukrainian air-to-air missiles, since Russian fighters were at higher speeds and high altitude, giving their missiles much more energy at launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TB0O4uG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
▲ Section of casing from R-77 warhead showing expanding rod and pre-formed shrapnel sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these disadvantages, aggressive Ukrainian tactics and good use of the low-level terrain during the first days of the invasion led to multiple claims and several likely kills against Russian aircraft, although Ukrainian fighters were often shot down or damaged in the process. After three days of skirmishing in which both sides lost aircraft, there was a notable pause in Russian strike and fighter sorties venturing deep behind Ukrainian lines, which lasted for several days. As such, during the latter half of the first week, Su-34 and Su-35S pairs instead conducted numerous standoff launches against suspected Ukrainian radars and bases using Kh-31, Kh-58 and Kh-59 missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early March, however, Russian SAM defences rapidly became much better coordinated and the threat from long-range S-400 ‘Triumph’ SAM systems based in Belarus and Crimea forced Ukrainian aircraft to fly at extremely low altitude – below 100 ft – for most of their sorties on the northern and southern axes. The threat from these long-range SAMs was compounded by the presence of a Russian S-band 48Ya6 ‘Podlet-K1’ all-altitude radar in Belarus covering the Kyiv axis, and another in the south (which was later destroyed near Nova Kakovkha). These mobile radar systems were introduced in 2018, and have allowed Russian forces to track Ukrainian fixed-wing and rotary sorties at altitudes as low as 15 ft at well over 150 km. Given the method of operation of the Podlet-K1, it is unlikely to be capable of successfully supplying the high-resolution data required for terminal guidance illumination of low-flying targets at longer ranges. The success on various occasions of low-flying Ukrainian fighters in ambushing Russian high-altitude patrols during the first week of the war in areas covered by the Podlet K-1 system would suggest it only gives a relatively low-resolution tracking capability. On the other hand, this may simply indicate a poor dissemination of surveillance information from the radar to the Il-20M ‘Coot’ airborne command post and relay aircraft passing information from ground networks to patrolling Russian fighters. However, Podlet-K1 was designed to allow modern S-300 variants and the S-400 system to fire long-range missiles at a detected target, relay mid-course updates on the target movements to the missiles while in flight, and hence guide the missile close enough to detect and lock on to the aircraft in question with its own active radar seeker head as it descends from a high apex. The confident Ukrainian attribution of the loss of several aircraft to S-400 missile engagements while flying at very low altitude and at significant distances would, therefore, seem to suggest that longer-ranged missiles fired by these SAM systems do indeed possess a post-apex lock-on capability as previously theorised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Donbas front and in the south, a similar task was performed by A-50M/U Mainstay AWACS aircraft which flew an average of two–three sorties per day, providing higher-resolution early warning and vector information on low-flying Ukrainian aircraft in those sectors. However, the effectiveness of A-50M as a force multiplier has been limited throughout the war by two factors. First, Ukrainian forces have found A-50 to be fairly easy to degrade via electronic attack, and report consistent success in doing so. Second, because the Russian air operation is subordinated to the Ground Forces, surveillance information is not typically relayed directly between A-50M and fighters on CAP or to long-range GBAD units such as S-400 batteries. Instead, information is normally relayed via the military district command post or a combined arms army command post, then either directly or via an Il-20M relay aircraft to the GBAD units and fighter patrols. This significantly slows the rate of data transfer and limits the VKS’s ability to use A-50M/U to directly guide weapon engagements by GBAD assets or fighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the first chaotic week of the invasion, it was becoming increasingly clear that Russian ground forces on the Kyiv and Kharkiv axes had become bogged down amid fierce Ukrainian resistance and Russian logistics difficulties. The airborne assault on Hostomel Airport had been repulsed by Ukrainian rapid reaction forces, and suddenly Russian forces had to adapt to a new plan. However, they had no coherent communications plan; many units had not exchanged encryption keys and had a shortage of trained radio operators. Furthermore, some radios were found to contain cheap Chinese substitute components lacking military-grade encryption, and so jamming resistance became a critical issue. The electronic warfare capabilities that had been initially very effective in degrading Ukrainian SAM systems were also causing serious electronic fratricide problems and thus compounding an increasingly critical communications breakdown among Russian ground force elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian ground forces being unable to effectively communicate now became a greater threat to the Russian operation than Ukrainian SAM systems, so their electronic warfare assets began to greatly scale back their operations after the first two days. This allowed newly relocated Ukrainian SAM systems to regain much of their effectiveness, although it took time to repair or adapt to much of the damage to key radar systems for early warning and long-range missile guidance. In the first week of March, however, Ukrainian SAMs began to inflict significant losses on Russian attack sorties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective Ukrainian SAMs against Russian fixed-wing aircraft have consistently been SA-11 ‘Buk’ systems operating transporter-erector launcher and radar (TELAR) vehicles as individual pop-up threats rather than as formed batteries alongside the usual target-acquisition radar and command vehicles. Alongside the longer-ranged S-300PS/PT and S-300V SAMs that had escaped destruction during the initial wave of strikes, the SA-11s quickly made Russian medium- and high-altitude operations prohibitively dangerous on the Kyiv and Kharkiv axes. At the same time, the VKS received new targeting priorities as it was swiftly becoming clear to the Russian leadership that the original military plan to rapidly seize Kyiv and other key cities and overthrow the Ukrainian government had failed. Therefore, the main VKS air effort was switched from attacks on Ukrainian air-defence capabilities to attempts to support the ground forces directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Ukrainian GBAD capabilities rapidly recovering from initial suppression and damage, they took over as the primary arm responsible for repelling the VKS near the frontlines from 3 March. The failure of Russia’s initial strike campaign to destroy the bulk of Ukraine’s medium-range SA-11 and SA-8 SAMs meant that as the VKS was re-tasked to attack Ukrainian Army positions in aid of the ground offensive, its pilots were forced to abandon flying at medium or high altitudes when penetrating Ukrainian airspace. At very low level, radar-guided SAM systems have a comparatively short effective range due to clutter and the curvature of the earth blocking their radar field of view to the target. Therefore, the final days of February and the first week of March saw the VKS conduct around 140 sorties per day, using Su-25, Su-30SM and Su-34 aircraft to conduct strikes at 500 ft or below using unguided bombs and rockets on Ukrainian positions. Once again, the sorties were flown as singles or pairs rather than larger formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While flying low did reduce losses from radar-guided SAMs, it also brought Russian jets into the range of the thousands of man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS) that had been widely issued to Ukrainian troops. The results were predictable, with at least eight assorted Su-25, Su-30 and Su-34 jets being shot down by MANPADS in a week. These strikes were also significantly less accurate than the medium-level bombing that had been conducted in the first few days and in Syria, since they were also conducted with unguided bombs and rockets. At very low levels pilots have only seconds to visually acquire, identify and then manoeuvre their aircraft to accurately drop weapons on targets. In this case, the targets were Ukrainian forces which were frequently well dug in and operating many of the same vehicles and weapons as Russian forces. A lack of up-to-date maps also compounded low-level navigation and target-recognition difficulties for Russian pilots. Consequently, penetrating daylight low-level strikes achieved little serious damage against Ukrainian forces and the concept of operations was rapidly judged to be unsustainable by experienced VKS fixed-wing pilots, who quickly began to refuse to fly missions beyond Ukrainian lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian Air War and Ukrainian Requirements for Air Defence15Bronk with Reynolds and Watling very low levels pilots have only seconds to visually acquire, identify and then manoeuvre their aircraft to accurately drop weapons on targets. In this case, the targets were Ukrainian forces which were frequently well dug in and operating many of the same vehicles and weapons as Russian forces. A lack of up-to-date maps also compounded low-level navigation and target-recognition difficulties for Russian pilots. Consequently, penetrating daylight low-level strikes achieved little serious damage against Ukrainian forces and the concept of operations was rapidly judged to be unsustainable by experienced VKS fixed-wing pilots, who quickly began to refuse to fly missions beyond Ukrainian lines. In response, the VKS shifted its penetrating sorties to night attacks from 9 March 2022. Since most Ukrainian MANPADS operators lacked night-vision goggles at this time, initial VKS losses were greatly reduced by operating in darkness. However, the only one of its fast jet fleets with cockpit equipment and appropriate training for contested low-level night operations was the Su-34s. Consequently, the Su-34 fleet bore the brunt of the remaining penetrating strike operations flown by the VKS before they were curtailed in April. As before, the primary armament remained heavy loads of FAB-500, or mixed OFAB-250 and OFAB-100 unguided bombs, although the Kh-29T/L standoff missile and Kh-31P anti-radiation missile (ARM) began to see increasing use for specific targets and suppression of enemy air defences (SEAD). With the difficulties of target acquisition and accurate attacks at low level compounded by flying at night, the general targeting profile also changed. Unable to accurately hit Ukrainian military units, the VKS defaulted to simply bombarding besieged cities as it had in Syria, except at night and from low level. Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol were all heavily bombed by the Su-34s during this period, since Russia was desperately looking to make symbolic progress as the Battle for Kyiv increasingly swung in Ukraine’s favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout March, Su-35S and Su-30SM fighters continued to conduct CAPs between 30,000 and 50,000 ft, but generally without entering Ukrainian-controlled airspace. Instead, they acted as a deterrent to Ukrainian attack sorties, but were also tasked to conduct SEAD operations. To this end, their CAPs were used as bait to try to make Ukrainian SAM systems turn on their radars to fire at them. If SA-11s or other SAMs did try to engage them, the Flankers would fire Kh-31P and, later, older Kh-58 ARMs at long ranges to home in on the radar emissions, and then turn away. Meanwhile Su-25 singles or pairs flown by experienced crews would fly in at low altitude to try to find and kill the SAM with rockets while it was suppressed. However, there were few Russian pilots capable of low-level destruction of enemy air defences (DEAD) sorties in an Su-25 with unguided rockets, and those that could frequently paid for their bold tactics by being hit with MANPADS from Ukrainian troops. Ukrainian Air Force aviation and air-defence commanders confirmed in multiple interviews that while Ukraine has lost a number of SA-11 and SA-8 SAMs to the many Kh-31P and Kh-58s fired since the invasion, none of the low-level Su-25 DEAD rocket attacks was successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the collapse of the Kyiv axes in April, Russian forces were reorganised and concentrated against Ukrainian positions in Donbas and in the southeast in the surrounded city of Mariupol. This allowed far better coordination of Russian aircraft, long-range strike capabilities, electronic warfare assets and GBAD with ground operations. Alongside continued heavy use of Kh-31P and Kh-58 ARMs by VKS fighters, Russian troops also began to effectively coordinate operations with hunting complexes of Orlan-10 UAVs to force Ukrainian SAM systems to unmask and then suppress them for long enough using electronic warfare attack to designate individual SAMs for accurate artillery and missile strikes. This rapidly forced medium-range Ukrainian Air Force SA-11 ‘Buk’ and short-range Ukrainian Army SA-8 ‘Osa’ SAM systems to operate further back from the frontlines to reduce loss rates, and allowed Russian aircraft a significant degree of freedom to operate at medium and high altitudes in the vicinity of the frontlines. Nevertheless, actual penetrations of Ukrainian lines to conduct strikes with fixed-wing aircraft on targets other than Ukrainian Army positions rapidly decreased due to persistent losses during even low-altitude night-time operations by Su-34s against cities such as Kharkiv, which involved very limited penetration distances. Instead, the Su-34 fleet began to regularly employ Kh-29T/L tv/laser-guided missiles for standoff attacks from medium altitude at distances of 8–15 km against fixed targets from mid-April. During this period, Russia also used 16 Tu-22M3 ‘Backfire’ bombers to drop heavy unguided bombs on the besieged Azovstal steel works in Mariupol from medium altitude by day on 21 April, in addition to repeated attacks by Su-34s carrying sticks of heavy FAB-500 unguided bombs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable feature of VKS fixed-wing strike operations from February to April was that BDA was poor. The primary assessment metric was whether crews reported hitting the target upon landing, and orbital imagery assessment was used to then confirm damage observed as expected. This meant that in most cases where damage was only superficial or had actually failed to hit the intended targets, follow-up sorties were not flown. A marked tendency to overstate successes has been a consistent feature of Russian intelligence and military BDA and planning cycles during the period leading up to and then during the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. This is an almost unavoidable consequence of the way that the Russian political system works, where reporting what seniors wish to hear, reinforcing their previous decisions and inflating successes, is an absolute prerequisite for promotion to higher rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the war to date, Russian Su-25SM/SM3 ground-attack aircraft have been used differently from the rest of the VKS fixed-wing fleet, being generally tasked with operations against Ukrainian Army targets at grid locations supplied by friendly assets on or near the frontlines. The deepest recorded strikes using unguided lofted rocket attacks by Su-25 formations were less than 100 km from the Russian frontlines, and most involved far shorter penetrations of Ukrainian lines. Su-25 sorties remained almost exclusively at low altitudes below 1,000 m and often at less than 100 m, especially close to the frontlines during rocket attacks or if patrolling for targets. MANPADS have been the primary threat for the Su-25, due to the need to regularly cross parts of the frontlines during such operations. However, their defensive aids suites have performed consistently well against most MANPADS; the losses have come from repeat exposure in areas with high concentrations of MANPADS teams, rather than a high probability of kill during individual engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From September 2022, the launch of the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kherson and subsequent counter-offensive in the Kharkiv region in the northeast granted Ukraine the initiative and has forced the Russian Army to go on the defensive across almost the whole of its remaining frontlines. In the air too, Ukraine has been able to significantly attrit and subsequently impose a degree of suppression on Russian GBAD using the Western-suppled AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation (HARM) missile. As such, Ukrainian Su-25 and Su-24 attack aircraft have become increasingly active, conducting regular standoff rocket attacks and even bombing runs against Russian positions in Kherson and Kharkiv. This has forced the VKS to adopt an increasingly defensive posture. The VKS has divided the Ukrainian/Russian lines into eight zones and maintains a regular posture of a pair of Su-35S fighters or Mikoyan Mig-31BM interceptors in each one. Without regular tanker support – which the VKS does not provide to fighter units due to limited capacity and prioritising the strategic bomber force – times on station for these CAPs are unlikely to exceed two hours, so at minimum this posture requires around 96 sorties per day to sustain in daylight. However, these patrols have proven highly effective against Ukrainian attack aircraft and fighters, with the Mig-31BM and R-37M long-range air-to-air missile being especially problematic. The VKS has been firing up to six R-37Ms per day during October, and the extremely high speed of the weapon, coupled with very long effective range and a seeker designed for engaging low-altitude targets, makes it particularly difficult to evade. The long range of the R-37M, in conjunction with the very high performance and high operating altitude of the Mig-31BM also allows it significant freedom to menace Ukrainian aircraft near the frontlines from outside the range of Ukrainian defences. The VKS has also started employing the R-37M from at least a few of its Su-35S fighters, which not only increases the reach of the latter in combat but may also suggests Russian stocks of the R-37M are in little danger of running out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2zzOuTc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
▲ MiG-31 BM carrying R-77-1 and R-37M missiles taking part in operations in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the demands for close air support from the Russian Army which has been forced to retreat from Kharkiv oblast and parts of Luhansk and Kherson, the strike tempo being flown by the VKS Su-25 and Su-34 fleets has not noticeably increased. The Su-25 force continues to conduct regular standoff rocket attacks, but these are only capable of producing a barrage effect in a rough area. The lack of targeting pods and multi-role expertise across the Russian fighter fleets leaves the Su-34 fleet as the only VKS element theoretically capable of conducting effective standoff dynamic targeting against Ukrainian forces moving in the open. The VKS is almost certainly anxious to minimise further losses of these expensive and complex aircraft, after losing at least 17 since February. Therefore, footage of Su-34s conducting unguided bombing runs over the frontlines at low level – exposing them to a high degree of risk from MANPADS and ground fire – suggests a degree of desperation. It may be that stocks of Kh-29T/L and other standoff missiles are running low, or that the Su-34s are struggling to accurately find and hit Ukrainian battlefield targets without coming in very low and getting close enough to visually identify them. There have also been several crashes in the VKS Su-25, Su-30 and Su-34 fleets during non-combat-related accidents since early September. Each one may be individually explained by bird strikes, pilot error or technical failures. However, collectively they suggest that eight months of war have taken a toll in terms of accumulated airframe and aircrew fatigue. Tired aircrew, ground personnel and continuing operational demands for support from the ground forces that force normal maintenance, leave and overhaul periods to be ignored are all likely to be contributing factors. In particular, the ground-attack-focused Su-25 and Su-34 fleets have both taken much heavier losses than the fighter fleets, with 23 of the former and 17 of the latter confirmed lost from pre-war fleets of around 110 modernised Su-25SM/SM3s and 130 Su-34(M)s. This will have further increased the burden of an operating tempo far in excess of peacetime expectations on the aircraft and pilots that remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the VKS conducted a more significant fixed-wing strike campaign during the initial days of the invasion than has previously been documented by external analysts. The ground-based Ukrainian air-defence network was initially suppressed by electronic attacks, decoy use and physical strikes, and this allowed Russian aircraft to attack more than 100 targets deep inside Ukraine. Ukrainian Air Force fighter aircraft bore the brunt of the air-defence task until the SAM systems and radars of the GBAD network had been relocated and reset sufficiently to take over primary responsibility at the beginning of March. The great disparity in technical capabilities and numbers between Ukrainian Air Force fighters and Russian ones meant that while Ukrainian fighter pilots were able to inflict some losses on Russian aircraft using aggressive low-level tactics, they also took many losses in return. However, once the SA-11 and S-300 SAM systems began to operate effectively, Russian strike aircraft were forced to operate at low altitudes when penetrating Ukrainian-controlled airspace, and Russian fighters had to stand off to patrol at high altitudes. Russia’s inability to effectively conduct DEAD against Ukrainian SAM systems has so far denied them the ability to control the airspace over most of Ukraine. The VKS has used Kh-29 and Kh-59 missiles to hit fixed targets from standoff ranges, usually using the Su-34 fleet. It has also used the Su-35S and Su-30SM fleets to fire large numbers of Kh-31P and Kh-58 anti-radiation missiles to suppress Ukrainian radar-guided SAMs, though this has failed to produce many actual kills. However, Russian close air support efforts have generally been limited to low-level unguided bombing runs and unguided rocket barrages, which have failed to inflict decisive damage on Ukrainian ground forces and have led to sustained losses to MANPADS among the Su-25 and Su-34 fleets. On the other hand, Russian high-altitude fighter CAPs with Su-35S and more recently with Mig-31BM interceptors are continuing to shoot down significant numbers of Ukrainian ground attack aircraft near the frontlines from distances that render them all but immune to return fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-russian-attack-helicopter-employment-and-performance&quot;&gt;II. Russian Attack Helicopter Employment and Performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the Su-34 frontal bomber fleet, the dominant ground-attack platform in the Russian air campaign has been the Ka-52 ‘Alligator’ attack helicopter. Alongside Mi-28 ‘Havok’ and Mi-24/35 ‘Hind’ gunships, the Ka-52 fleet conducted aggressive hunter-killer sorties at very low altitude against Ukrainian forces during the early months of the war. These sorties were generally flown in pairs and used a combination of unguided rockets and cannon fire against troop concentrations and soft-skinned vehicles, and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) against armoured vehicles and other hardened targets. In Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in the south, where Ukrainian air defences took particularly heavy damage in initial strikes on 24 February, hunter-killer sorties from Ka-52s were observed penetrating up to 50 km into Ukrainian-controlled territory during late February and into early March. Ka-52s and Mi-24s also escorted the Mi-8/17 transport helicopters carrying Russian airborne troops into Hostomel Airport on the first day of the invasion, with at least one Mi-24 being shot down by a Javelin anti-tank missile used in direct attack mode and a Ka-52 force landing after taking small arms fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the battle for Kyiv, Mi-24 and Mi-28 gunships operated alongside the Ka-52 in the hunter-killer role at night, as well as in daylight. However, typically night operations of this kind have been flown by the Ka-52 fleet due to their superior night-vision equipment. It is also likely that the doctrinally established role for Ka-52 – to provide support to Russian special operations forces including in adverse conditions and at night – meant that a much greater proportion of Ka-52 aircrew were trained and current in low-level night operations compared with in the Hind and Havok fleets. However, following the Russian retreat from Kyiv in April, penetration distances and the number of hunter-killer sorties began to diminish rapidly across all the gunship fleets. Heavy losses taken during daylight operations, especially among experienced crews, created a dynamic whereby Russian rotary crews became very hesitant to cross the Ukrainian frontlines from April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian helicopter (and fixed-wing attack jet) defensive aids suites combining missile-approach warning sensors and countermeasures-dispensing programmes have functioned reasonably well throughout the conflict, succeeding in decoying many incoming missiles. However, the sheer number of MANPADS fired at them during penetrating sorties ensured that many hits were still scored. Furthermore, at several points during early March and later in Donbas, Russian helicopters failed to dispense flares when engaged by MANPADS. This suggests that either they had run out already during that sortie, or potentially supply chain issues were forcing crews to fly with their defensive aids suites set to semi-automatic or manual modes to reduce consumption rates at the cost of reduced effectiveness. The British Starstreak and the American Javelin anti-tank missile (used in direct-attack mode) have been particularly effective against all Russian helicopters as they are immune to being decoyed by flares or chaff countermeasures. However, these weapons require a significantly greater level of operator training and are more expensive and scarcer than normal MANPADS. Javelin has also largely been saved for attacks on Russian tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After heavy initial losses, Russian helicopters almost solely engaged in attacks with unguided rockets from behind the Russian frontlines during the Russian offensive in Donbas between April and July, and in defensive operations against Ukrainian counter-offensives in Kherson and Kharkiv since September. During these indirect rocket attacks, Russian helicopters typically approach a target area while flying at below 200 ft, then pitch up to between 15 and 30 degrees and fire S-8 and S-13 unguided rockets in a lofted trajectory against known concentrations of Ukrainian forces in a general grid square. Immediately after firing all their rockets in a salvo, they turn away while dropping countermeasures without crossing their own lines. The accuracy that can be obtained using these tactics is generally poor, sufficient only to force Ukrainian forces in the open to take cover, or to fix dug-in units in place until the impacts subside. In Donbas, both Ka-52 and Mi-24s also regularly conduct these indirect attacks at night to keep Ukrainian troops awake. In general, however, Russian helicopters have struggled to conduct low-altitude sorties at night outside the areas of Donbas, occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014 and thus well known to them. Russian maps of most of Ukraine as provided to all troops are often decades out of date and helicopter crews are no exception, making low-level flight at night very hazardous since obstacles are unlikely to be mapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATGMs are sometimes also used by gunships to attack Ukrainian positions, or vehicles that can be spotted and identified without crossing the lines. However, Russian gunships face a notable disadvantage when operated in this manner since they have very poor vibration dampening. This means that the gyro-stabilisation of internal optics struggles to produce a clear picture at high magnification levels, making acquisition, positive identification and precise laser or command-wire guidance at longer ranges very challenging. This limits the practical range of Russian helicopter-launched ATGMs, and forces them to expose themselves to potential attack by MANPADS, Javelin in direct attack mode, and ground-launched ATGMs by firing from close to the frontlines. The final penetrating hunter-killer sorties were conducted by Ka-52s in June 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confirmed losses of Russian gunships at the time of writing, where wreckage has been positively identified, include eight Mi-24/35 ‘Hind’, six Mi-28 ‘Havok’ and 23 Ka-52 ‘Alligator’ helicopters. The true total is undoubtedly higher, but Stijn Mitzer and Joost Olieman’s numbers in the Oryx blog also include several helicopters destroyed on the ground or in accidents, and the overall proportions are likely to be fairly representative. What stands out is that the Ka-52 fleet has taken a disproportionate number of losses compared with the other gunship types operated by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons that are likely to have contributed to this. First, the Ka-52 has seen more intensive use than the other fleets, both by day and especially at night, on all fronts in Ukraine. Second, the Ka-52 has notable deficiencies in armour protection compared with other Russian attack helicopters, especially the engine compartments, which have no armour plating at all – leaving them potentially vulnerable to damage from even small arms fire. Third, the Ka-52 uses a different ATGM from the Mi-28 and Mi-24/35; the 9K121 Vikhr uses a laser beam-riding guidance system with the seeker on the missile mounted at the rear facing backwards rather than in the nose like a traditional laser seeker. In other words, the seeker on the Vikhr looks back at the helicopter to ‘see’ the laser guidance beam, rather than looking for a laser spot reflected off the target. This makes it almost impossible to jam in flight and also cheaper than comparable traditional ATGMs. However, it also means that the Ka-52 cannot drift more than a few degrees per second to the left, right, up or down while guiding the missile in flight, or the laser beam from the helicopter will move outside the field of view of the seeker and guidance will fail. The result has been that Ukrainian troops have been able to shoot down Ka-52s using wire-guided Stugna anti-tank missiles on several occasions, when the helicopters were hovering almost stationary attempting to identify and guide their Vikhr missiles to targets near the frontlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gj8vcTc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
▲ S-8 unguided rockets ready for loading on to a Kamov Ka-52 attack helicopter for standoff attacks against Ukrainian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple Ka-52 airframes have also been recovered after being shot down in a condition that suggests poor maintenance and crew training are problems. Modern encrypted radio sets have been found without the encryption keys needed to use them, and in others the radar and other sensors have been found either in the stowed position or with pins or covers still fitted that prevent them from working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the Russian attack helicopter fleet was initially used to conduct aggressive hunter-killer sorties behind Ukrainian frontlines, with penetration depths of up to 50 km relatively common. However, losses to MANPADS were heavy and so Russian tactics shifted during March, with penetrating sorties becoming less and less common; they were replaced by rocket ‘lofting’ attacks from a safe distance. Since April, Russian attack helicopters have been used extremely cautiously, with a heavy reliance on standoff rocket attacks rendering them little more than flying rocket artillery assets. Despite this cautious approach, they continue to be shot down regularly by Ukrainian frontline units using MANPADS, Javelin and, occasionally, ATGMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-russias-long-range-strike-campaign-cruise-missiles-ballistic-missiles-and-loitering-munitions&quot;&gt;III. Russia’s Long-Range Strike Campaign: Cruise Missiles, Ballistic Missiles and Loitering Munitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion began with a heavy cruise and ballistic missile barrage, the opening salvo in a sustained long-range precision-strike campaign which averaged around 24 missiles per day for the first three months of the war. From 24 February to the end of May, more than 2,000 3M-54 Kalibr, Kh-101, Kh-55, Kh-555 and other cruise missiles were fired into Ukraine, usually in salvos of 4–12 at once. The Kalibrs are fired from naval ships and submarines in the Black Sea, while the Kh-101, Kh-55 and Kh-555 are typically launched from Tu-95 strategic bombers from inside Russian airspace. Around 240 9M720 and 9M723 ballistic missiles were also fired from Iskander-M ground-based launchers at around 160 targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian land-attack cruise missiles and ballistic missiles have performed well throughout the conflict, with most impacting within 3–10 m of their intended aiming points, except when degraded by Ukrainian electronic warfare assets. Furthermore, during the initial strikes, Ukrainian air defences were themselves degraded by electronic warfare and most were relocating during the early salvos to avoid being destroyed so only succeeded in intercepting a small proportion of the incoming cruise missiles. Intercepting Russian Tochka-U and Iskander ballistic missiles has proven very difficult throughout the conflict due to a lack of suitable interceptor missiles and the short range of potential coverage for each system against such threats. Iskander 9M723 is especially problematic for Ukrainian air defences due to its quasi-ballistic manoeuvring capabilities and the fact that it launches six penetration aids to generate additional radar returns and electronic warfare effects during its terminal phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary Russian long-range strike objective during the first three days was to degrade and destroy Ukrainian air-defence capabilities. As such, Russian strikes overwhelmingly targeted air-defence sites including fixed radars, fixed S-125 (SA-3) SAM sites, command centres, airbases, ammunition storage sites and known long-range S-300 mobile SAM sites. Most of these represented fixed targets that Russia had been able to identify and integrate into a strike plan during the months leading up to the invasion. Conventional methods for locating targets included orbital reconnaissance and electronic and signals intelligence (ELINT and SIGINT) aircraft such as Su-24MR ‘Fencer-E’ and Il-20 ‘Coot’ aircraft conducting standoff reconnaissance flights to map Ukraine’s defences. However, perhaps Russia’s most important source of targeting information for the opening and subsequent stages of its strike campaign remains human intelligence (HUMINT). The Russian ‘special services’ including the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), Federal Security Service (FSB) and Main Directorate of the General Staff (GU) run active teams and officers who control networks of recruited assets, including important regional and national politicians and military officers inside Ukraine. Controlling Ukraine has been one of Russia’s longest running foreign policy goals, and thorough penetration of its government and security apparatuses has been a task for the Russian special services ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union. As such, Russia has had access to detailed information about the workings of the Ukrainian state and military for decades, which provides a rich source of data for planning and targeting long-range strikes against fixed defence sites, bases and important infrastructure nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite detailed Russian target lists and heavy firepower, Ukrainian air defences were on alert on the 24 February and, after receiving urgent warnings from partner states, relocated most of their mobile air-defence systems shortly before their positions were struck by the first wave of Russian missiles. Consequently the losses among mobile assets were light, consisting of a number of S-300PS/PT SAM transporter erector launchers (TELs) that could not be moved in time due to insufficient warning and poor chassis serviceability. However, many static early warning radars were hit and at least temporarily knocked out. Several older static SA-3 SAM sites were destroyed. The Russian missile (and fixed-wing) strikes were most effective in the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions where warning times were lower than in Donbas or in the north and many units had older, less serviceable equipment. Strikes on Ukrainian Air Force airbases and ammunition stowage also caused limited damage due to timely dispersal of airworthy Ukrainian aircraft to smaller bases and relocation of most ammunition stocks in the hours prior to the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mM4czEV.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
▲ Penetration aid from a Russian 9M723 Iskander ballistic missile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening salvos exhibit one of the clearest features of Russia’s long-range strike campaign against Ukrainian military targets during the war. The Russian military and intelligence services collectively demonstrated an ability to collect detailed information about Ukrainian air-defence target locations. This was then used by each Military District command centre to develop a coherent target list according to the overarching plan at the operational level, which was then used to assign targets to individual strike assets serving each of the four main operational directions. The missiles themselves generally hit the aiming points assigned to them with sufficient precision, and the opening salvo was well coordinated with electronic warfare effects to ensure almost all of them got through the largely blinded and suppressed Ukrainian air defences. However, in many cases the targets of each strike had moved by the time the missiles hit their designated aiming points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the initial salvos failed to destroy Ukrainian air-defence capability on 24 February, the Russian target detection, tracking and fire-mission assignment process was not fast enough to stay ahead of continued Ukrainian dispersal and shoot-and-scoot tactics. For example, HUMINT on a Ukrainian air-defence position located by GU assets would be passed into the ‘Akatsiya’ strategic command architecture in Moscow, then integrated into the next 24 hours strike plan at Military District command-centre level, and assigned to a strike asset. This process takes at least 48 hours and sometimes significantly longer to result in a strike. As such, when used against mobile targets the Russian long-range strike complex has consistently generated accurate strikes using expensive cruise and ballistic missiles (or long-range rocket artillery) on the exact positions long since vacated by Ukrainian systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having failed to achieve a quick military victory in the first few days, Russian long-range strike assets were re-tasked in early March from Ukrainian air-defence sites to infrastructure and government targets. These included transmission towers for Ukrainian television and radio in Kyiv, Vinnytsia and other cities, and attacks on internet and mobile phone infrastructure. These strikes were coupled with a significant increase in the already-intensive Russian offensive cyber campaign against Ukraine. There were also sporadic strikes on government buildings and symbolic civilian targets such as Kharkiv University, which caused many civilian casualties and increased refugee flows out of the country. The primary aim appears to have been to degrade Ukrainian government public messaging and coordination capacity in the hope that Ukrainian resistance and political unity might still fracture and allow a pro-Russian takeover. Targeting buildings with governmental, security and cultural importance in cities with large cruise and ballistic missile warheads also served to increase the pressure on President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian public by raising the spectre of massive damage and civilian casualties in besieged cities if fighting continued. Strikes were also directed at important Ukrainian defence industry factories to reduce the capacity to produce, maintain, modernise and repair domestically manufactured equipment, as well as targeting a training and assembly base for Western volunteer fighters in Lviv on 13 March. While significant damage was done, it did not have decisive results due to the scale of Western support, the volume of captured Russian military equipment, ammunition and spares available to Ukrainian forces, and the rapid dispersal of many previously centralised facilities to reduce their vulnerability to further attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weight of fire that Russia could sustain limited the overall effectiveness of this approach, since aside from large broadcast towers, physically destroying a critical mass of communications equipment in a country the size of Ukraine would require attacking a huge number of relatively small targets. By mid-March the VKS fixed-wing fleet was flying almost no penetrating sorties by day, and those that were being flown were exclusively low-level flights to drop unguided bombs on area targets in support of the ground forces. Large-scale cyber attacks also failed to have a decisive effect as Russia had been conducting sustained cyber warfare against Ukraine since 2014, so most key networks were heavily defended, with attention given to backing up critical data with help from allies. This left only Russia’s cruise and ballistic missile arsenals available to conduct deep strikes across most of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also relies heavily on its long-range precision-strike arsenal for conventional and tactical nuclear deterrent capability against NATO under the doctrine of non-contact warfare. With the Russian Army increasingly bogged down and overstretched in Ukraine, and a strategy of brinkmanship from President Vladimir Putin predicated on intimidating the West into abandoning or at least limiting its military assistance, Russia cannot afford to fire its entire stockpile. Therefore, Russia’s military leadership began to plan for a new set of targeting criteria that could deliver a greater strategic effect with the limited number of total missiles available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next major Russian bombardment strategy was instigated in June, with several weeks of daily strikes against Ukrainian fuel storage facilities, refineries and key railway infrastructure. This could potentially have had a very serious effect on the Ukrainian population and the war effort over time if it had been conducted on a large scale from the outset. However, two major factors conspired to reduce its impact to a manageable level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Ukrainian air defences had, by this stage, been reorganised and redeployed to provide much more effective coverage against cruise missiles around key cities and facilities. Whereas during March and April interception rates had been around 20–30%, by mid-June they were roughly 50–60%. The SA-11 ‘Buk’ SAM systems provided the bulk of the anti-aircraft threat near the frontlines to keep Russian fast jets and helicopters flying low or further back behind Russian lines. The long-range S-300PS/PT and S-300V1 SAM systems are more capable against cruise missiles and Tochka-U ballistic missiles than SA-11, and provide coverage over a wider area. They are also more valuable and less mobile than SA-11 so it made less sense to risk having them destroyed by Russian SEAD/DEAD efforts by deploying them close to the frontlines. Therefore, Ukraine’s S-300 systems were primarily deployed to defend cities and infrastructure, and have proven highly effective against all types of Russian cruise missiles, especially when supplied with early warning information of launches from either Ukrainian sensors or partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6UYeU3S.png&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;
▲ Russian 3M-54 Kalibr cruise missile shot down in Kyiv oblast late October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia was already running uncomfortably low on missile stocks given its requirements to maintain a contingency stockpile to deter NATO and the heavy expenditure from February to June. Despite benefiting from an impressive degree of component modularity and commonality between different missile types, including between cruise missiles such as 3M-54 Kalibr and ballistic missiles such as 9M723, Russian industrial production capacity is very limited compared with the rate at which they have been expended. For example, the modernised 9M723 Iskander production line has a monthly output capacity of six missiles. Effective sanctions enforcement to complicate Russian acquisition of Western micro-electronics would make their sustainment problems considerably worse given the heavy reliance on US, Taiwanese and other Western chips in all their standoff missiles. As a result of these shortages, firing rates of Russia’s standard long-range land-attack missiles were lower from June to September than the 24 per day average in the first three months of the war. In combination with a revitalised Ukrainian air-defence capability, this lower rate of fire has hampered the ability of Russian long-range strikes to prevent Ukraine steadily gaining the initiative in the war during this period. However, during this period Russia’s stockpile limitations and inadequate production capacity for traditional cruise and ballistic missile types led to several significant actions on the part of the Russian military leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OjhCJlo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image8&quot; /&gt;
▲ 9M723 Iskander ballistic missile remains with penetration aid (decoy) dispenser tubes visible. The R-77-1 air-to-air missile is also visible (left).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Russian forces began firing large numbers of other long-range missile types in the land-attack role. Older Kh-22 ‘Kitchen’ anti-ship missiles have been fired into Ukraine throughout the conflict, but as early as mid-March Russia also began launching the relatively new, supersonic and hugely expensive P-800 ‘Oniks’ anti-ship missile from its ‘Bastion-P’ systems in Crimea. However, the radar-guided terminal-homing capabilities of anti-ship missiles are not optimised for attacking ground targets, and so offer not only reduced precision compared with dedicated land-attack weapons when used in that role, but can also sometimes home in on the wrong target once they go active. One likely case was the devastating attack on a shopping centre in Kremenchuk in July 2022 where a Kh-22 apparently missed its intended target nearby and instead homed in on the large radar reflection of the shopping centre’s flat metal walls and roof. Russia also began to regularly use its S-300V1 and S-300VM tracked long-range SAM systems in the land-attack role, especially in the south near Kherson. Both versions fire the 5V55 missile which was designed to have a secondary land-attack capability for self-defence of the S-300V1. In the land-attack role, it has a ballistic trajectory with a maximum range of 82 km. Its high supersonic speed makes it impossible to intercept with current Ukrainian air-defence systems and it delivers a large 130-kg high-explosive fragmentation warhead. However, it is a very inaccurate weapon, being purely ballistic with no terminal homing capabilities against ground targets, and so Russian forces generally use them as indiscriminate bombardment weapons against cities – especially Mykolaiv. Russian industry has also opened a new production facility to recondition and return old stocks of Tochka-U ballistic missiles to usable condition to supplement dwindling 9M720/723 Iskander-M stocks and production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second significant consequence of Russia’s ineffective (albeit very destructive) initial standoff missile campaigns and limited remaining stockpiles was a deal with Iran to supply large numbers of Shahed-136 loitering munitions and Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) support to teach Russian units to assemble and use them. The first Shahed-136 (Russian name, ‘Geran-2’) attacks were recorded by Ukrainian air defenders in mid-September, with attacks against Odesa alongside Iranian-supplied armed Mohajer-6 UAVs. An IRGC training group protected by an FSB security detail was identified and monitored by Ukrainian intelligence services, and destroyed with a precision artillery strike in Kherson around this time. Unfortunately this did not end the Russian acceptance and ramp-up process for large-scale Shahed-136 use as a long-range strike weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shahed-136 itself is a propeller-powered missile with a warhead capacity of 20–40 kg, depending on fuel load, desired range and consequent centre of gravity limitations. It has a maximum range of well in excess of 1,000 km and typically cruises at around 150–170 km/h. Guidance is provided using a mixture of inertial navigation and civilian GPS receivers with some features to improve jamming resistance, allowing it to hit fixed aiming points, but not moving targets. The accuracy is sufficient to produce multiple hits on a single building, and the Shahed-136 can also bank to circle around a target upon arrival to perform a steep (&amp;gt;70-degree) terminal dive from a specific bearing programmed before launch. A modified version equipped with specialist seeker heads and datalinks can apparently hit moving targets if designated by a more sophisticated UAV such as the Orlan-10, although these modifications significantly increase the price and are not common. The basic Shahed-136/Geran-2 is a relatively simple, cheap and precise weapon for use against fixed targets for which Iran can supply components and Russia could license manufacture in very large quantities. This makes it an important medium- and long-term component in Russia’s current long-range strike strategy against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YkxguzD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image9&quot; /&gt;
▲ Wing-tip section from a destroyed Shahed-136.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Russian strategy opened with a barrage of cruise missiles and ballistic missiles against targets in multiple Ukrainian cities, including in central Kyiv on 10 October. This time, cruise missiles were launched alongside tens of Shahed-136 loitering munitions. More than half the total incoming weapons were shot down by Ukrainian air defences, but those that got through still inflicted serious damage and multiple civilian casualties. Despite Putin claiming that the strikes in cities were a one-off retaliation for an explosion on the Kerch Bridge the previous week, the new strategy – to target electricity infrastructure – was already being prepared before the bridge was bombed. On 9 October a new commander of the Russian military campaign against Ukraine, General Segey Surovikin, was appointed. Notorious for the brutality of the campaign he ran in Syria in his previous role as the commander of the VKS, Surovikin was appointed to implement a strategy that many of the more extreme Russian political and media commentators have been urging for months – to deprive the Ukrainian civilian population of light and heating as winter approaches via large-scale strikes on infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 10 October, Ukraine has seen multiple daily waves of Shahed-136s fired against electricity substations, infrastructure-control offices and facilities across most of the country. The relatively small warhead is less suitable than cruise missiles or ballistic missiles for destroying large or hardened targets. Therefore, the expensive Kh-101 and Kalibr cruise missiles and 9M723 Iskander, drawn from increasingly depleted stocks, have been simultaneously used to hit power stations and other large electricity-related targets. Most of the Shahed-136s that are launched are being shot down by Ukrainian fighters, SAMs, MANPADS teams and anti-aircraft gunfire. However, they are being used in large enough numbers already – with more than 400 fired since mid-September – that they are draining Ukraine’s air-defence missile stocks in an alarming way, and still each day some get through to their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, Russia’s long-range missile campaign has gone through several phases. The opening salvoes targeted Ukrainian Air Force air-defence capabilities and stockpiles. Strikes subsequently focused on Ukrainian defence industry, communications infrastructure and small numbers of symbolic buildings in key cities. After the Russian ground campaign refocused on offensive operations in Donbas, fuel storage, refineries and railway infrastructure became primary targets for long-range strikes. However, in each of these cases Russia was unable to generate a critical concentration of strikes to have decisive effects on Ukraine’s ability to continue fighting. Under General Surovikin the strategy has changed again. Iranian-supplied loitering munitions and more expensive traditional precision-strike weapons are now being used in tandem to systemically target critical civilian electricity infrastructure. The multiple daily air-raid alarms disrupt work and sleep patterns and cause fear and anxiety for people who had hoped the threat to their homes was receding. More worryingly, temporary blackouts that grow more frequent each day across many of Ukraine’s key cities after just three weeks of this new strike campaign suggest that it poses a major threat to Ukraine’s ability to keep its people warm and safe during the coming winter months. It is unlikely to change Russia’s battlefield fortunes in Ukraine, but the latest iteration of Russia’s long-range strike efforts is causing major problems and generating new requirements for Ukrainian air-defence equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-the-need-for-more-western-aid-to-improve-ukrainian-air-defence&quot;&gt;IV. The Need for More Western Aid to Improve Ukrainian Air Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the success of the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kharkiv, its subsequent recapture of Lyman and continued pressure in Luhansk and Kherson, Russia is faced with the prospect of military defeat on the ground in 2023. Partial Russian mobilisation will take several months to produce even barely competent new troops to augment battered regular units, let alone entire new formations. The task will be especially difficult given that the instructors and experienced officers Russia would normally count on to train new conscripts are largely either stuck trying to hold the frontlines in Ukraine or have become casualties. In response to the lack of viable options on the ground, Russia’s leaders have turned to renewed long-range bombardment against civilian critical utilities. The plan is to cause enough civilian suffering that the Zelensky government is either forced to negotiate ceasefire terms or face major civil unrest that delays preparations for a renewed counter-offensive push to liberate the remaining occupied territories of Ukraine in spring 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s air and missile strike operations between February and August 2022 failed to produce decisive effects against Ukrainian target sets that ranged from air defences to communications, military industry, transport and fuel infrastructure. The failure of the VKS to mount an effective SEAD/DEAD campaign in the face of effective, dispersed Ukrainian Air Force GBAD operations cost it the ability to operate above very low altitude in Ukrainian airspace. This was critical in allowing the Ukrainian Air Force fighter and ground-attack fleets to survive and continue to contest control of the air and attack Russian ground forces, despite being completely outmatched at a technical level. Meanwhile, the large number of MANPADS provided to Ukrainian troops and later mobile air-defence teams near the frontlines meant that even very low altitude VKS fixed-wing penetrations proved prohibitively costly in March, and ceased by April 2022. In consequence, Russia has not been able to effectively employ the potentially heavy and efficient aerial firepower of its fixed-wing Su-34 ‘frontal bomber’ and multi-role fighter fleets by bombing Ukrainian strategic targets, except during the first few days of the invasion. Instead, Russia’s attempt at strategic air attack has been limited to expensive cruise and ballistic missile barrages at a much more limited scale. These barrages have nevertheless caused major damage and have killed many Ukrainian citizens. Fortunately, Russia’s limited stockpiles and production capacity of standoff missiles prevented adequate concentration or sustainment of effects against communications, transport or fuel infrastructure target sets. However, this should not lead to Western complacency about the need to urgently bolster Ukrainian air-defence capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian adoption of the Iranian Shahed-136 as a cheap weapon able to conduct large-scale, sustained precision strikes on civilian infrastructure and other fixed, non-hardened targets marks a key change in the character of the air war. Ukrainian air defences are currently shooting down the majority of incoming Shahed-136s and around half of the cruise missiles fired by Russia using a combination of SAMs, fighters with R-73 air-to-air missiles, mobile MANPADS teams and anti-aircraft guns. However, most of these interceptions use munitions that are far more expensive and are available for Ukraine in more limited quantities than the Shahed-136 is likely to be for Russia. Western SAM systems that have been supplied so far have proven highly effective against incoming cruise missiles, including the stealthy Kh-101, but have been supplied with inadequate ammunition for Ukrainian usage rates even though they are not being used against Shahed-136. MANPADS are effective and relatively efficient against Shahed-136 and cruise missiles when they pass within range of mobile air-defence teams. However, the numbers required are large due to short range and the need to defend cities and infrastructure across Ukraine, in addition to protecting frontline troops from Russian attack aviation and UAVs. Due to its relatively small size, shape, low altitude flight and low speed, legacy Soviet and Russian self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (SPAAGs) such as Shilka and Tunguska also struggle to reliably shoot down the Shahed-136, although the German Gepard is highly effective. After two weeks of sustained Russian attacks on electrical infrastructure, new deliveries of equipment and systems specifically tailored to efficiently providing defence against Shahed-136 attacks are already one of Ukraine’s top priorities in terms of support from its international partners. The weapon is simple and not especially difficult to intercept, but most of the current means of doing so are too expensive or draw on unacceptable numbers of weapons required for other defence tasks to provide an adequate medium-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, therefore, Ukraine urgently requires deliveries of large numbers of additional MANPADS for mobile and static air-defence teams, and many modern SPAAGs such as the Gepard, LvKv 90 or Skyranger as possible. It also requires additional supplies of night-vision goggles to enable MANPADS teams to operate effectively at night. Additional ammunition and more launchers for the highly effective IRIS-T SLM and NASAMS systems are also critical to enable the Ukrainian Air Force to defend remaining electricity infrastructure and protect repair work from higher-end cruise missile attacks. With rolling blackouts already affecting much of the country and the weather already getting cold, the urgency of these requirements is hard to overstate. Neither MANPADS or SPAAGs should be considered politically sensitive as they are fundamentally defensive weapons needed to protect civilian infrastructure that do not require the absolute latest in cutting-edge technology to be effective. Rapidly gifting even small inventories of stored MANPADS and SPAAGs currently offers European states that wish to support Ukraine but face political difficulties in delivering longer-ranged offensive weapons or heavy armoured vehicles to make a real difference now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, Ukraine needs a way to produce or at least procure and operate efficient defence systems against Shahed-136 and other UAVs at scale. Countries that have significant experience defending against multiple relatively slow loitering munitions and UAVs such as South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Israel would make sense in terms of potential sources of ideas and subsystems, even if politically they were unwilling to directly supply Ukrainian forces. In general, gun systems are preferred over missiles where possible due to the much lower cost per engagement and higher availability of ammunition compared with SAMs and MANPADS. A relatively simple new product that combined a small counter-UAV AESA radar with an attachable predictive aiming reticule sight is one option that, if possible, would offer a way to significantly enhance the capability of Ukraine’s many traditional anti-aircraft guns such as ZSU-2-23 and 14.5-mm/12.7-mm heavy machine guns against Shahed-136.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine also needs a way to resupply its Soviet-made and domestically upgraded S-300 and SA-11 ‘Buk’ SAM systems in both the anti-missile and battlefield anti-aircraft/counter UAV role. Eight months of high-intensity combat have consumed unprecedented and unforeseen quantities of interceptor missiles, and Western allies have few ways to supply more directly or indirectly. Western militaries have invested very little in production of medium- and short-range GBAD systems since the end of the Cold War due to overwhelming air superiority in every conflict since then. This means that production is now having to ramp up from a very low level and existing inventories are too small to meet Ukraine’s needs. This will make it impossible to replace the large number of remaining S-300, SA-11, SA-15 ‘Tor’ and SA-8 ‘Osa’ systems operated by Ukraine directly in the medium term, let alone expand coverage. Therefore, it would seem sensible for Ukrainian industry to work with industrial partners in Western countries to set up new manufacturing lines as fast as possible for key SAM system ammunition such as the 5V55 missile for S-300PS/PT and S-300V1, and the 9M38 missile for the SA-11 ‘Buk’. This would have the side benefit of greatly improving Western familiarity with missile families that in various derivations are still in widespread use by adversaries including Russia, China and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukrainian SAMs are allowed to run out of ammunition, then not only will Ukrainian infrastructure and other key target sets become dramatically more vulnerable to Russian missile strikes, but the Russian VKS fixed-wing fleet would suddenly again be able to start penetrating deep into Ukrainian-controlled airspace at medium and high altitudes. Russian fighters retain the capability to dramatically overmatch Ukrainian ones if allowed to roam freely at high altitude, as has been shown by their lethality against Ukrainian Air Force jets conducting low-level operations against Russian positions in Kherson in recent weeks. In addition to the radar performance and missile range advantages that have always been a factor, the VKS Su-35S and Mig-31BM fleets can now draw on a lot of live air-to-air combat experience from conducting continuous CAPs close to Russia’s own borders. As such, the underwhelming VKS fighter performance during the first days of the invasion is unlikely to be repeated if Ukrainian SAMs are starved of ammunition to the point that they can no longer deter Russian fixed-wing incursions. Furthermore, despite the relatively poor operational-level coordination between different Russian fast-jet fleets, and limited close air support capabilities against organic battlefield targets in contested environments, the experience of rebel groups and the Islamic State in Syria should remind those quick to dismiss the VKS of how much firepower they can and regularly do apply to fixed targets if allowed to operate freely at medium altitudes. The inability of the Russian Air Force to coordinate large-scale complex SEAD/DEAD operations to neutralise Ukraine’s ground-based air-defence network has been the key factor that has prevented it from being one of the main threats to Ukraine’s war effort so far. It is vital that the West does not lose sight of the fact that it must help Ukraine to keep that air-defence network supplied and reinforce it, otherwise that situation could change fairly rapidly in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian Air Force also urgently needs more Western weapons that can enhance the standoff lethality of its existing attack jet fleet in a similar manner as the AGM-88 HARM was integrated to allow SEAD strikes against Russian SAMs. Due to the very serious threat from Russian long-, medium- and short-range GBAD systems and Russian fighter patrols, Ukrainian attack aircraft must fly very low when anywhere near the frontlines and still regularly suffer losses. Very low-level approaches to target areas make detecting and designating for laser-guided weapons or achieving electro-optical or infra-red lock-on against targets almost impossible due to the very short period and range within which they appear within the pilots’ field of view. Clearly, the more standoff range can be offered, the more losses will be minimised. Candidate weapons must be able to be programmed with the release and target parameters before being loaded onto the jet, since Western smart munitions are unlikely to be able to exchange data directly with existing Ukrainian aircraft avionics. They would need to have sufficiently capable automated target detection and attack capabilities to reliably detect and destroy Russian ground vehicles themselves when delivered roughly to the right target area. Since these weapons would primarily be needed to counter Russian mass as mobilised formations appear on the frontlines in spring 2023, suitable munitions would also need to exist in Western stockpiles in large numbers. Such a demanding list of criteria leaves a very small number of potential options, with the American CBU-105 Sensor Fused Weapon being one potential option worth exploring. If it could be released by Ukraine’s Su-24 bombers in a lofted profile from a fast low-altitude pop-up delivery, then guided to a more precise aim point by pre-programmed GPS coordinates, the multiple anti-armour homing skeet submunitions would be devastating against Russian vehicle concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, Ukraine needs new fighter aircraft able to meet Russian fighters on more equal terms as soon as possible, especially if providing sufficient ammunition to maintain frontline SAM coverage proves difficult. The enduring threat from Russian long-range S-400 SAMs, especially when cued in by radars capable of tracking them at low altitudes from long ranges such as the 48Ya6 Podlet-K1, is likely to force Ukrainian fighters to operate at low level as part of standard tactics. The effective range of air-to-air missiles is inherently tied to launch altitude and speed of both the aircraft firing and its target. As such, any new fighter for the Ukrainian Air Force needs to come equipped with a missile capable of offering the greatest possible effective range under low-altitude, subsonic launch conditions. Electronic warfare capabilities to reduce the effectiveness of Russian radars at longer ranges would also be highly beneficial, as would a radar designed to be resilient against the Khibny jamming pods that Russian fighters typically fly with over Ukraine. Aside from improved air-to-air performance, the main Ukrainian operational priority is for an aircraft capable of operating from dispersed, relatively basic airbases to prevent them being located and rapidly destroyed by Russian long-range missile strikes. This entails an ability to be serviced with limited personnel and heavy equipment, and to operate from relatively rough and short runway surfaces. Anti-shipping capabilities are also required. Any new fighters also need to be able to generate high sortie rates from both an availability and affordability perspective, since the Ukrainian economy has been devastated by the Russian invasion and new fighters are competing with a huge range of other requirements. As a long-term plan, the Ukrainian Air Force wants to operate a split fleet of a single engine light multi-role fighter and a longer-ranged twin engine fighter for greater air-defence persistence. However, in the short term, even a tiny number of modern Western fighters would be a huge boost to Ukraine’s ability to continue deterring the VKS from penetrating its skies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to supply a Western fighter would inherently be heavily influenced, and most likely ultimately decided, by political factors. In the long term, US-supplied aircraft are likely to form a large part of the Ukrainian Air Force inventory due to political, industrial and financial considerations. However, while Ukrainian airbases are still at high risk of Russian missile strikes, the long, high-quality runways and large hangers with extensive ground support equipment required to operate most US fighters would be difficult to build without being observed and hit. It is worth noting that of the currently available Western fighter aircraft that could possibly be suppled, the Swedish Saab Gripen C/D offers by far the most suitable candidate in terms of operational requirements. It was designed from the outset for ease of maintenance, and can be refuelled, re-armed and given basic maintenance by teams of just six ground crew using two vehicles on small airbases or highways in cold weather. Moreover, only one of each crew needs to be a highly trained maintainer; the rest can be conscripts or even troops. Conceptually, the Swedish Air Force has always emphasised low-level air superiority tactics from dispersed bases, in a similar manner to how the Ukrainian Air Force currently operates, and so the Gripen was designed with ground support equipment and maintenance requirements compatible with that approach. The electronic warfare suite on the Gripen C/D is also optimised specifically for countering Russian fighter and SAM radars. Other factors that make Gripen particularly suited to Ukrainian operational needs are that it can fire the very long-range European Meteor missile, which, thanks to its ramjet propulsion design, is less adversely affected by being launched from low and slow than traditional rocket-powered missiles such as R-27 or AIM-120 AMRAAM, and Gripen was also designed from the outset with an anti-ship capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since April, VKS pilots have been extremely reluctant to aggressively fight their way into Ukrainian airspace due to the losses taken during early attempts. The threat of Ukrainian SAM and MANPADS engagements has shaped the behaviour and constrained the effectiveness of Russian pilots significantly. Therefore, even a few modern Western fighters with long-range missiles able to meet the Russians on technically equal or even superior terms would likely have a disproportionate deterrent effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western military aid has quite rightly concentrated on equipping and supporting the Ukrainian ground forces until now. Ukraine has so far managed to hold its own in the air domain, largely using its own equipment. However, there is a real danger that this success leads to Western complacency about the threat that the VKS can still pose to Ukrainian forces, infrastructure and cities if given an opening. Ukraine now needs rapid deliveries of SAM launchers and missile ammunition, SPAAGs and ideally Western fighter aircraft to prevent a sustained strike campaign that could, if unopposed, thwart the dominant battlefield momentum that Ukrainian troops have fought so hard to win.&lt;/p&gt;

The question of our sovereignty and resilience in an interdependent world takes on a new twist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since 2017, France has chosen to reinvest in its armies, to deploy a French and European strategy of sovereignty in the face of an upheaval in global balances. The last two years have accelerated and intensified the transformations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fracturing of the world order brings with it challenges and risks that we must address if we are to retain our freedom. Faced with this phenomenon of globalised hybrid warfare, I therefore wanted a national approach in continuity with and in addition to the European Union’s strategic compass adopted under the French Presidency, and the NATO strategic concept launched at our request in 2019, which was also adopted this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our findings and conclusions from 2017 remain relevant. We were not mistaken, so there is continuity in our vision, but continuity does not mean inertia in the face of an history that is hardening and accelerating. The time has come for a more comprehensive mobilisation to better equip us in all respects for the historic challenges of a world where strategic competition and confrontation are merging. It is a question of refining our analyses in order to draw operative conclusions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By 2030, I want France to have consolidated its role as a balancing, united, radiant, influential power, a driving force for European autonomy and one that assumes its responsibilities by contributing, as a reliable and supportive partner, to the preservation of multilateral mechanisms based on international law.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The conclusions of the National Strategic Review make it possible to increase the independence and strength of our Nation in the new strategic context in which we live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;assessment-of-the-strategic-environment&quot;&gt;Assessment of the strategic environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 represents a strategic shift. On the one hand, combined with other structural developments, it confirms the observation of changes in the threat assessment described in the 2017 national defence and security strategic review, updated in 2021. On the other, it calls for an adaptation of our strategic response to build up our moral strength and resilience, consolidate our alliances and accelerate the modernisation of our defence mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Confirmation. As described in the 2017 strategic review, increased strategic competition, the weakening of the tools of the collective security architecture, the effects of intimidation or aggressive strategies, combining military and non-military actions, manipulation of information, and even nuclear threats for the purpose of intimidation, have become apparent to the world, and particularly to our fellow citizens. The disinhibition of global and regional powers pursuing revisionist agendas and opportunistic military policies is combined with a growing trend towards isolationism or identity-based withdrawal. In addition, the consequences of proliferation, technological or otherwise, and the persistence of the terrorist threat also remain prevalent. Other major global challenges likely to cause significant imbalance must be added to this picture, such as the impact of climate change: access to water, food insecurity, migration, demography, pandemics, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) This observation requires us to rapidly adapt our global response, to accelerate our efforts to promote the emergence of a common and shared conception of European defence, as well as of its strategic autonomy, to modernise our national defence mechanisms, and to boost our moral strength, resilience and alliances. The war in Ukraine further justifies the decision of the President of France, made in 2017, to modernise our defence mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Consolidation. We must continue the efforts made while also accelerating, adapting and completing our strategic posture in the face of threats that are changing in pace, nature and space. Without replacing terrorism or crisis-management threats, these threats are part of a framework that is increasingly marked by the high intensity of potential confrontation between conventional forces and so-called “hybrid” (cyber, digital and space attacks) or — access denial strategies that challenge our interests (exploitation of the vulnerabilities of logistics flows or infrastructure, air and sea spaces).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) By strengthening its resilience, by giving itself the means to move towards a war economy, by adapting the areas in which it is present according to its strategic interests and by pivoting towards conflict in new areas and of high intensity, France takes a global approach to entirely fulfil its role as a balancing power and to promote a stable international order based on the respect of the law and on multilateralism. It also intends to support the strengthening of the sovereignty of its partners in order to enhance the stability and security of the regions concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) This observation makes it all the more necessary to pursue our efforts to promote the emergence and implementation of a common and shared conception of European defence, as well as of its strategic autonomy, complementary to our active participation within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and our various partnerships, while guarding against the side effects of the sometimes changing strategic or geographical priorities of these allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Objectives. While they do not call into question the strategic analysis that has prevailed since 2017, the acceleration of the overall deterioration of our environment and the war in Ukraine nevertheless justify a reassessment of the current military programming law based adjusted and structuring strategic objectives (SO) described in this national strategic review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) First, the fundamentals remain: France is and will remain a power with a robust and credible nuclear deterrent [SO no. 1], a structural asset for strategic dialogue and for the protection of our vital interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) At the other end of the spectrum, what sustains our model and gives it credibility is our moral strength: that of the French people, namely, that of a united and resilient France [SO no. 2], that of an economy capable of turning itself into a war economy [SO no. 3], that of leading cyber resilience [SO no. 4], which are the conditions that underpin national sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) However, our weight in the world cannot be based on the principle of sovereignty alone. The principle of solidarity is essential, all the more so in a deteriorated context. France wants to be an exemplary and demanding ally within the Euro-Atlantic area [SO no. 5] while also being one of the driving forces for European strategic autonomy [SO no. 6] and a reliable partner in its diplomatic defence relations and, a credible provider of security [SO no. 7].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11) Influence has been given a strategic function. This new function, now an essential part of the expression of power, is a key element of our ability to promote France’s interests and counter the actions of our competitors across the entire spectrum of hybridity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12) Supporting deterrence and backed by our moral strength, in support of our alliances and partnerships, our military capabilities enable us to have an operational impact that benefits our defence. Our military capabilities are based on sovereign capabilities, autonomy of assessment and appreciation — an essential step that gives meaning to acts and intentions —, anticipation and decision-making [SO no. 8], a willingness and ability to act in hybrid fields in the face of increasingly aggressive strategies and the will to bypass our competitors [SO no. 9], as well as a proven ability to conduct high-intensity military operations in extensive areas of conflict [SO no. 10].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13) Perspectives. The strategic objectives thus described serve to structure a project, both political and military, for the development of the army model which will form part of the future programming law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14) This national strategic review explains the underlying factors that guide the work on reassessing the military programming law that is currently in progress. It offers an action-oriented consideration of the changes necessary in terms of, for example, moral strength, the resilience of the Nation through National Service (SNU), the war economy and with regard to the future armed forces model. Finally, it enables the principles on which these changes will be transcribed into the next military programming law (2024-2030) to be established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-from-strategic-competition-to-strategic-confrontation&quot;&gt;1.1 FROM STRATEGIC COMPETITION TO STRATEGIC CONFRONTATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15) Identified in the 2017 national defence and security strategic review and then in the 2021 strategic update as a long-term trend, the renewal of the phenomenon of strategic competition is now taking place at both a global and a regional level, in configurations that expose us more visibly and are becoming more widespread. Revisionist ambitions have intensified, giving rise to numerous displays of uninhibited opportunism from the eastern Mediterranean to the Sahel and the Pacific. We are thus moving from latent competition to open confrontation on the part of Russia and, increasingly, to greater competition with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The pandemic, the climate crisis, the migration crises and the return of a high-intensity war on European soil remind us of the far-reaching interdependence between the national and international arenas, in the areas of politics, economics, energy and food. These crises illustrate how the fracturing of the world order can restrict our freedom of action. The 2022 national strategic review is therefore in line with and complementary to the European Union’s strategic compass and NATO’s strategic concept, which were adopted this year. It aims to apply these strategies while integrating our national characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16) The practice of challenging and circumventing the international order, based on multilateralism and the rule of law, whether reflected in the United Nations, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) or in the reactivation of territorial disputes, is becoming more commonplace and diverse, and follows in the footsteps of past breaches (Helsinki principles, INF and Open Skies treaties, Budapest Memorandum, etc.). The body of agreements and laws built since the end of the Cold War is crumbling and, although the causes are not recent, this phenomenon has accelerated sharply since 2014. By way of illustration, out of the agreements that until recently maintained a balance in the Euro-Atlantic area, only the New START Treaty remains; furthermore, it is due to expire in 2026 without a clear successor. Bypassed and hollowed out if not denounced head-on, this arms control architecture is now more necessary and more weakened than at any time in almost forty years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-assumed-revisionist-ambitions&quot;&gt;Russia: assumed revisionist ambitions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17) Russia is pursuing a strategy that seeks to undermine European security, of which the war against Ukraine, launched on 24 February 2022, is the most open and brutal manifestation. During the implementation of its ambition of power conceived as an opposition to what Russia calls “the collective West”, Moscow had for a long time privileged a more indirect approach, focusing on undermining the West on a politico-diplomatic level: information warfare and interference, types of action whose perpetrator is difficult to name, search for transatlantic division, etc. Without having disappeared, this strategy is now accompanied by a desire to engage in a direct military confrontation, materialised by the war of aggression against Ukraine. Rewriting history and the national narrative, the Russian government is increasingly open about its imperial ambitions based on a balance-of-power approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18) The future of Russian military power after this ordeal will be an important issue for the Atlantic alliance and Europe over the coming decades, as the strategic concept adopted at the Madrid summit and the strategic compass adopted under the French presidency of the Council of the EU (FPCEU) strongly underline. Regardless of the outcome of the war, it will have seriously debilitated the human and material potential of the Russian forces. The need to regenerate this potential will come up against the effects of sanctions on the Russian economy and defence technological and industrial base (DTIB), but should continue to be financed to a large extent. The weakening of its conventional forces over the long term could lead Moscow to privilege more indirect modes of confrontation while boosting the role of its non-conventional weapons in its strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19) In light of the split caused by the war and the irreversibility of Russia’s strategic choices, it is necessary to anticipate a confrontation with Moscow based on the trio of competition, challenge and confrontation, taking place over a long period of time, in multiple regions and spaces. This move towards confrontation is already taking place in Africa, through offensive diplomatic manoeuvres combined with anti-Western information-based attacks and the use of mercenaries. Moscow sees in this globalised hybrid war substantial leverage in external theatres and in environments where new types of action are now being taken. Thus, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, the Baltic area, the Balkans, and the North Atlantic, but also Africa and the Middle East, offer the possibility of prolonged confrontation and the risk of incidents that could escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;peoples-republic-of-china-the-affirmation&quot;&gt;People’s Republic of China: the affirmation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20) In addition to staying in power, the goal of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is still to supplant the United States as the world’s leading power. Considering American power and the Western model to be in decline, the Chinese regime believes that Western leadership of the international order has weakened and that it can weaken it further by using its new influence. The CCP is therefore banking on the passivity of a majority of non-Western countries over the war in Ukraine to fuel a discourse that portrays an opposition based on “the West against the rest”. However, beyond ideology and the war in Ukraine, such questioning irrigates fields which are political (propaganda on the decline of the West), economic and technological (predation, trade war), military (growth of the nuclear arsenal, modernisation of the PLA, areas of support abroad) and diplomatic (a more assertive attitude in international forums, recourse to a bilateral balance of power or to alternative multilateral formats, such as the 14+1 or the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation) in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21) The modernisation of China’s military apparatus continues and enables the PLA to support an increasingly assertive strategy, including on the military front, whether in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly with regard to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, or in other regions of the world where Chinese diplomacy calls to clients, especially in Africa. The political nature of the PLA and the civil-military integration deployed in the technological, economic and information fields enable an unprecedented scope of hybrid actions. The latter is only constrained in practice and, at this stage, by the PRC’s decision to challenge the international security architecture from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22) The growing strategic convergence between the PRC and Russia opens up the prospect of greater contestation within international bodies, directed against the expression of Western objectives and offering opportunities for political alignment against the West and the United States in particular. The common desire to set aside or silence differences in order to challenge Western influence, particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine, gives rise to occasional forms of cooperation. This situation is primarily visible at the diplomatic level and in information warfare. On a structural level, the imbalance in China-Russia relations in favour of Beijing is set to grow with the Ukrainian crisis. The political, strategic and technological implications could be enormous for global governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23) Examining Western cohesion and the impact of sanctions against and embargoes on Russia over time will also provide the PRC with a valuable insight into the scope of economic coercion methods that could be used against it in a major crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;13-contested-and-weakened-democracies-in-the-battle-for-influence&quot;&gt;1.3 CONTESTED AND WEAKENED DEMOCRACIES IN THE BATTLE FOR INFLUENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24) In a context of increasingly intense strategic competition and confrontation, the position of liberal democracies has been weakened because they defend an international order whose foundations (international law, multilateralism, values, etc.) are openly challenged by several states. This dynamic is sustained by resentment towards political legacies, sometimes colonial, and perceptions of unfair development, which dovetail with the consolidation of authoritarianism and illiberal regimes around the world. These dynamics make it more difficult to understand the changing environment of our operations and to anticipate crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25) This situation manifests itself in the fields of influence and perception. Russian and Chinese operations in these areas seek to undermine our own political systems and national cohesion, while fuelling or even creating alignments against us, as the war in Ukraine demonstrates. Our opponents are counting on the discrediting of Western discourse based on humanist values, and asymmetry in the relationship with laws and in the respect for international humanitarian law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;26) Our competitors use the law as a weapon against our interests to ensure their ascendancy. A tool of hybridity, the strategic use of laws (or lawfare) can be broken down into three major areas: the growing instrumentalisation by certain states of their own laws, in particular through extraterritoriality; the use, misuse or circumventing of international laws; and the exploitation of legal and judicial vulnerabilities resulting from our domestic laws or European commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;27) Finally, Western states must consider the inevitability of technological catch-up and dissemination, which are now taking place. This form of technological equalisation helps to make numbers important again. By sometimes taking a more agile approach and having larger volumes, our strategic competitors have the capacity to tip the regional balance, such as Iran in the ballistics field. At the same time, multilateral regimes that fight against dissemination have become less effective, undermined from the inside by Russia in most cases. GAFAM, or other private players, are emerging as non-state players whose active or passive contribution must be included as input data as from the challenge phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;14-conflict-between-the-return-of-nuclear-reality-high-intensity-and-hybridity&quot;&gt;1.4 CONFLICT BETWEEN THE RETURN OF NUCLEAR REALITY, HIGH INTENSITY AND HYBRIDITY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;28) Initial lessons from the war in Ukraine are characterised, in particular, by the threat of nuclear escalation and its trivialisation by a nuclear-weapon state. Combined with the collapse of arms control architecture and the persistence of proliferation crises, Russia’s use of nuclear rhetoric for offensive purposes in support of the invasion of Ukraine has the potential to undermine strategic balances and, in the longer term, to exacerbate proliferation. A successful coercive manoeuvre backed by nuclear weapons would set a dangerous precedent. Russian intimidation and threats of coercion under the shadow of nuclear weapons also undermine the efforts of the P5 states in the area of doctrinal transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;29) The next-generation war waged by Russia is characterised by a return to an integral strategy combining far-reaching hybrid actions and high-intensity operations. The lessons of this major engagement under the nuclear umbrella of the aggressor underline the importance of perfect multi-domain operations, known as the multi-environment and multi-field manoeuvre (M2MC), as well as the need for joint action that is significant in terms of its mass and density. They also remind us of the need to create an international approach to strategic competition, allowing us to signal our determination, to prevent and channel the escalation options of competitors operating under different constraints and in different registers from our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30) Nuclear multipolarity that has been relatively contained until now, could take a more deregulated form. This is due, in particular, to the undermining of the international frameworks and security guarantees, the expansion pathways of already established nuclear powers and the emboldening of regional players. On the one hand, the quantitative and qualitative growth of China’s nuclear arsenal, combined with Russia’s actions, could jeopardise further efforts to preserve nuclear arms control agreements governing the arsenals of the main holders. On the other, aside from the cases of North Korea and Iran, the non-proliferation regime could be subject to renewed tension. The proliferation of their delivery systems (ballistic and cruise missiles, drones, etc.), a hardening of military postures and the development of access denial capabilities will provide many regional powers with greater capacity to cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;31) Hybrid strategies have shown their impact on multiple theatres. Their effects continue to spread in Africa, the central and eastern Mediterranean, and the Indo-Pacific region. These strategies exploit the difficulty for Western states to provide an effective response that is compatible with respect for the political commitments, treaties and principles that underpin the international order. Using a variety of levers, they are adapted to the geography of the interests of the players implementing them, enabling these players to affect France’s interests at the lowest possible cost, in mainland France and its overseas territories, and abroad. Common spaces (cyber, space, seabed and, air and sea) are now the subject of a renewed competition for power. The actions that have already been taken in these spaces reflect the appropriation by all states of an approach that is applied to these spaces on the basis of the entire trio of competition, challenge and confrontation. Their operational and geographic importance is growing while the common rules governing them are insufficient, weakened or contested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;32) In terms of hybridity, states are increasingly systematically using cyber as a weapon to defend their strategic interests or in the context of geopolitical tension. In addition to the development of offensive capabilities, sophisticated off-the-shelf, cyber-espionage weapons and tools are gradually being developed by private companies. This cyber-arms race increases the risk of escalation, the stages of which are not equally understood. Finally, cybercrime, a threat that has reached an unprecedented level of sophistication and disinhibition, constitutes a strategic challenge for our national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;15-crisis-areas-and-regional-opportunism&quot;&gt;1.5 CRISIS AREAS AND REGIONAL OPPORTUNISM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;33) The refocusing of the United States on the strategic competition with the PRC is accompanied by a shake-up in the balance of power between regional powers. In the Near and Middle East, the diplomatic and military emboldening of certain regional powers is concomitant with the destabilisation of already fragile countries. The persistence of proliferation crises (Iran, North Korea, Syria in the case of chemical weapons) helps fuel these sources of regional destabilisation. These dynamics affect our strategic interests because they are accompanied by a rearrangement of intra-regional agreements, alliances and power relations. The distrust of the West and the laws it promotes provides the basis for Russia’s and the PRC’s policies of influence in Africa and the Near and Middle East. Within Europe itself, the Western Balkans are likely to be an area of fragility in the short term which these countries may seek to exploit to divide and weaken Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;34) The international jihadist movement will continue to spread and pose a security challenge for the next decade, both for the West and for the fragile countries of the Muslim world, from Africa to Southeast Asia. Exploiting favourable conditions (poor governance, endemic corruption, lack of social justice, strategic competition), it will help fuel areas of crisis and destabilisation in the Levant, North Africa, the Sahel and West Africa, for which a military response, in support of local partners, will continue to be sought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;35) The war in Ukraine is also a reminder of how regional crises and global challenges can interact and reinforce each other. Energy has once again become a key issue and a geostrategic lever. The — potentially changing — geography of producers and supply routes fuels energy rivalries that redraw the balance of power. The strategic nature of energy flows complicates the challenges of resource management as many terminals and pipelines (gas and oil) are located in areas of tension. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have highlighted the importance of food as a lever of influence and coercion for certain regimes. Food security has re-emerged as a domestic political stability imperative for many states. The acceleration of the effects of global warming, possibly coupled with a global food crisis, will exacerbate migration phenomena, manipulated or not, and create new areas of tension, likely to weigh on both Western cohesion and each country. Our overseas territories will be increasingly exposed to the security consequences of these underlying trends (increased predation, more violent and destructive natural disasters, migration pressure, etc.), which may require a greater commitment from the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;36) The war in Ukraine also poses the risk of a return to state terrorism. It may be assumed that given Russia’s uninhibited actions, weapons of all kinds are being recovered in the Ukrainian theatre to serve proxy or terrorist groups. These weapons could be used against our interests, alongside a disinformation campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-strategic-solidarity-faced-with-the-challenge-of-confrontation&quot;&gt;2. STRATEGIC SOLIDARITY FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE OF CONFRONTATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;37) The acceleration of the risk of conflict and the rapid expansion of the fields of confrontation confirm the need for strategic alliances and the principle of solidarity that structures them. This strategic solidarity must be assessed according to whether France is the beneficiary, the sole provider or one of its components, whether within the EU, NATO or ad hoc coalitions, for example against Daech or in the Sahel-Saharan strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;38) The deterioration of the international environment, the risk of opportunistic strategies in the face of the stretching of our interests and the diversity of areas of action highlight the immense difficulty for France to respond alone to all the challenges (Eastern and Northern Europe, Mediterranean-Red Sea, Near and Middle East, Indo-Pacific, Africa, Arctic, etc.). The robustness of our partnerships, the maintenance of a high level of interoperability with the United States, and our ability to build permanent or temporary strategic alignments in a changing environment will more surely condition our global influence and our weight in the development of a more stable environment. They will also allow us to anticipate — and thus prevent — potential side effects of competition, or even rivalry between allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;21-europe-at-a-crossroads-to-become-a-strategic-player&quot;&gt;2.1 EUROPE AT A CROSSROADS TO BECOME A STRATEGIC PLAYER&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;39) A great deal of progress has been made in recent years in the field of European defence, both in the area of capabilities — creation of the European Defence Fund (EDF), implementation of Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), strengthening of the European Capability Development Plan — and in the operational area with the creation of the European Peace Facility, or in the social area with the handling of migratory crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40) The adoption of an ambitious strategic compass in March 2022 is a first step, symbolising a shared desire to strengthen coherence in defining and pursuing our strategic objectives. Its implementation will be key to strengthening the Union’s capacity to act by 2030, in particular in the operational area and in contested strategic spaces. Furthermore, the lifting of Denmark’s opt-out from the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) is a positive signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;41) The development of a real politico-military action capability for Europe in its immediate environment remains an objective. In terms of capabilities, the decisions taken at the Versailles summit (10 and 11 March 2022) have made it possible to launch a new effort, which must be pursued with all European partners. A great deal of work will have to be done to continue to develop a common strategic culture, which is essential for the emergence of a European defence. The joint declaration of 21 September 2021 on a European strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and the adaptation of the European maritime system in the north-west Indian Ocean have the long-term objective of establishing the EU as a credible player and provider of maritime safety and security to the States of the region. This dynamic is already at work in the Arabian Gulf (EMASoH/AGENOR) and the Eastern Mediterranean (QUAD MEDOR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;42) Deepening cooperation between the EU and NATO will be essential to further strengthen European strategic autonomy and the transatlantic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;43) Finally, our cooperation efforts on a European scale have been intensified, by focusing on a wider range of partners with whom large-scale sectoral cooperation has been launched, whether in terms of capabilities, operations or through the establishment of strategic partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;22-an-atlantic-alliance-strengthened-in-the-context&quot;&gt;2.2 AN ATLANTIC ALLIANCE STRENGTHENED IN THE CONTEXT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;44) NATO remains today the foundation and essential framework for Europe’s collective security. For the majority of our European partners, this observation is made with renewed force by the return of war to the continent and the open and lasting confrontation with Russia, as shown by Finland’s and Sweden’s applications for membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;45) The period opened in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea and the maintenance of a conflict in the Donbass, tangible signals of growing Russian military aggression, which forced NATO to make a major effort to adapt. This collective awareness has manifested itself in increased investment, with a third of allies reaching or exceeding 2% of GDP in their defence budgets. This significant effort must be continued as part of a collective increase in power against opponents who unapologetically pursue their own interests. This development is beneficial in that it brings our European partners closer to our view that we must collectively take more responsibility for defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;23-the-american-pivot&quot;&gt;2.3 THE AMERICAN PIVOT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;46) For the United States, the PRC is the long-term strategic priority, with a fundamental shift starting in 2007. This focus permeates many areas of US policy, relations with traditional allies and its positioning in multilateral forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;47) Washington is perceived as being in search of a formula that will allow it to reduce its involvement in regional theatres that it now considers secondary (Africa, Middle East), while strengthening the security of its partners. This objective involves, for example, an effort to promote more integrated Middle Eastern partners (Abraham Accords) and to formalise agreements in ad hoc formats around energy, political and military projects (e.g. Pacific Islands Forum). This repositioning is already prompting states in the region to invest in managing their own security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;48) Through the war in Ukraine, the United States has again emerged as the main provider of European security, through the scale of its reassurance efforts and military support to Ukraine. A potential weakening of US investment in areas of European interest (Africa, Middle East), which are more exposed to the unilateral aims of middle powers and the rise of anti-Western views, could affect our ability to make a lasting contribution to the security and stability of these regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;24-our-partnerships-to-be-reinvented&quot;&gt;2.4 OUR PARTNERSHIPS TO BE REINVENTED&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;49) France, a balanced power, refuses to be locked in bloc geopolitics. It is important to maintain this long-standing and authentic position in the search for a balanced relationship with our allies. France has a long history of establishing strategic partnerships in its areas of interest, in which our partners must find security, stability and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;50) In Africa, we face major security and humanitarian challenges. The terrorist threat remains high in the Sahel-Saharan strip and is spreading towards the Gulf of Guinea. Russian actors, including the private military company Wagner, are carrying out actions that are contrary to our interests, while their involvement results in a deterioration of the security situation, the predation of economic resources, numerous abuses documented by the UN and the ever-greater fragility of the states that resort to them. The PRC has a stranglehold on infrastructure, the economy and debt, creating risks of dependency of our partners, as well as of espionage and restrictions on our operating environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;51) With the Latin American and Indo-Pacific regions, France can strengthen its cooperation and consolidate the relations of our overseas departments, regions and communities with their immediate environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;52) The ability of certain competitors to propose alternative models, most often based on a transactional approach and less governed by normative concerns, also has an impact, particularly on states under political, economic or food pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;reminder-of-national-security-interests-and-confirmation-of-strategic-functions&quot;&gt;Reminder of national security interests and confirmation of strategic functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;53) France’s interests include all factors that contribute to its security, prosperity and influence. In particular, a distinction should be made between:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the protection of the national territory, including the overseas territories, and of French nationals against external threats and attempts at internal destabilisation, including the terrorist threat;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the security of the EU Member States and the euro-atlantic area under the treaties by which we are bound;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the stability of our neighbourhood, given the immediate repercussions that any crisis emerging there would have on our own territory, both metropolitan and overseas;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;freedom of access to common spaces (cyber, space, seabed, air-sea spaces, and the poles), which is now threatened by challenges to the rules-based international order and by approaches based on power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;54) Defending these interests is now more complex because of the more systematic use of force and intimidation by some of our strategic competitors, and because of an international context that has been permanently damaged by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;55) France’s main lever for achieving this remains the long-term maintenance of its autonomy of decision and sovereign action in the face of all the threats that arise. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the world’s seventh largest economy controlling the second largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ), a nuclear-weapon state, and a founding member and driver of European integration, France has essential tools to assert its interests on the international stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;56) However, the increasing number of constraints on our interests makes it more necessary than ever to have robust and sustainable means of action, adapted to recent developments in the world. Our defence apparatus contributes to this on several levels, as the basis of our independence and freedom of action in the world in the face of threats of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;57) In this respect, the policies defined in 2013 and 2017 remain fully valid and their concrete implementation must be continued and accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;58) They establish that the defence of our security interests rests on three pillars: the strengthening of our strategic autonomy; the achievement of European sovereignty and the consolidation of our alliances; the preservation of a stable international order, based on respect for the law and multilateralism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;59) In any case, it remains the ultimate responsibility of the President of the Republic to constantly assess the nature of our interests and the attacks that could be made on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-frances-security-priorities&quot;&gt;1. FRANCE’S SECURITY PRIORITIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-strengthening-our-strategic-autonomy&quot;&gt;1.1 STRENGTHENING OUR STRATEGIC AUTONOMY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;60) Strategic autonomy is the sine qua non condition for the protection of our fundamental interests. At its core are the capacities for autonomous assessment, decision making and action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;61) Our freedom of action and the protection of our fundamental interests are ensured first and foremost by the credibility of nuclear deterrence, the keystone of our defence strategy. The fundamental aim of deterrence is to prevent a major war that would threaten the survival of the nation by protecting France against any state-sponsored aggression against its vital interests and against any attempt at blackmail. In a more uncertain and complex world, where some countries are on a worrying trajectory of opacity and rapid growth of their nuclear arsenals, or even raise the spectre of using the weapon for intimidation or blackmail, maintaining the credibility of our deterrent over the long term remains essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;62) Our autonomy also depends on the strengthening of a credible, coherent and balanced armed forces model. This requires conventional forces whose size and equipment allow for a conventional-nuclear linkage that is sufficiently robust to preserve the President’s freedom of action and avoid a circumvention of deterrence from below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;63) Strategic autonomy is also based on other factors: national cohesion, economic and industrial independence, securing our supplies, and international influence, particularly through strong diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;12-the-achievement-of-european-sovereignty-and-the-consolidation-of-our-alliances&quot;&gt;1.2 THE ACHIEVEMENT OF EUROPEAN SOVEREIGNTY AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF OUR ALLIANCES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;64) The protection and promotion of our fundamental interests cannot be limited to the national level. We must continue to contribute actively to the defence of European interests and our collective security. These objectives require the strengthening of our international cooperation, partnerships and alliances, first and foremost within the EU and NATO, where we are bound by certain security guarantees (Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and Article 42-7 of the EU Treaty). Investing in ad hoc partnerships, already existing or to be created, will also allow us to forge common responses to certain challenges according to specific geographies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;65) Beyond these commitments, our interests must be seen in light of the growing interweaving of the interests of European states, united in a common destiny. The return of approaches based on power and war to the European continent illustrates the importance of continuing and deepening integration among Europeans in order to foster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the development of a common strategic culture in all fields (extension of the work undertaken in the 2022 strategic plan);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the ability of Europeans to defend their security interests against potential aggression, in particular in their immediate neighbourhood, including through the development of common defence capabilities allowing for greater interoperability;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;joint European action in support of the international order based on law and multilateral management of global issues (United Nations, non-proliferation regimes, etc.);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the affirmation of the EU as a geopolitical actor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;13-the-defence-of-a-stable-international-order-based-on-the-rule-of-law-and-multilateralism&quot;&gt;1.3 THE DEFENCE OF A STABLE INTERNATIONAL ORDER BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND MULTILATERALISM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;66) In addition to our commitments to our EU partners and NATO allies, our interests must also take into account the states in our neighbourhood and those to which we are linked by partnerships or defence agreements. This concerns areas of the world where states are engaging in increasingly aggressive strategic competition, and where non-state groups may be able to directly threaten our citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;67) As a balancing power, France has a duty to contribute to the stability and security of these regions. The location of some of our territories in these areas requires us to maintain our presence in all areas and gives us a particular legitimacy to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-expansion-of-strategic-functions&quot;&gt;2. EXPANSION OF STRATEGIC FUNCTIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;68) The various strategic functions to which the armed forces contribute, identified in the 2008 White Paper, have seen their relevance confirmed as the strategic environment has evolved. They cover knowledge-appreciation-anticipation, deterrence, protection-resilience, prevention, intervention, and now influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;69) Influence, in all its dimensions — diplomatic, military, economic, cultural, sporting, linguistic, informational — is an area of dispute, which requires a coordinated response. It is a new strategic function in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70) Their proper structuring serves an integrated approach to respond to the evolving continuum of threats posed by our adversaries to our interests and values and those of our closest partners. In this respect, they remain dependent on our ability to ensure good coordination at both European and multilateral level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;21-knowledge--appreciation--anticipation&quot;&gt;2.1 KNOWLEDGE — APPRECIATION — ANTICIPATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;71) The knowledge-appreciation-anticipation function feeds into all the other strategic functions. The maintenance of an autonomous capacity for assessment is a guarantee of sovereign decision making. It contributes directly to understanding the intentions of our competitors. While being a condition for the operational effectiveness of the forces, it contributes to the economy of the resources used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;72) The five areas of this function are intelligence, knowledge of theatres of operation, diplomacy, foresight and anticipation, and information management. The recent crises and breakdowns as well as the extension of conflicts to new areas justify strengthening this function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;73) The effort must focus on understanding the phenomena in order to anticipate and facilitate the reactivity of the decision. Faced with the pace of crises and escalation, but also with the saturation of irrelevant information or information manipulated by our competitors, collective effectiveness depends more and more on the ability to sort, prioritise and circulate intelligence as quickly as possible, in order to understand the phenomena it describes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;74) The knowledge-appreciation-anticipation function has a strong partnership dimension. In order to maintain an autonomous assessment of the situation on priority issues, France must also rely on the assessment of its partners in addition to its own resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;22-deterrence&quot;&gt;2.2 DETERRENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;75) Nuclear deterrence is based on its political, operational and technical credibility. In order to be solid, this credibility must continue to be based on an in-depth strategic culture, dynamic and cutting-edge scientific research, technical and operational know-how that is constantly maintained, strong industrial sovereignty, and understanding of the issues by our fellow citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;76) The purpose of deterrence is to protect us from any state aggression against our vital interests, wherever it comes from and whatever its form, and it remains the ultimate guarantee of the Nation’s security, protection and independence. It ensures our autonomy of decision and freedom of action in the context of our international responsibilities at all times, including against attempts to blackmail us in the event of a crisis. By its existence, it contributes to the security of the Atlantic alliance and to that of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;77) The deterrence assets are being renewed while being maintained at a level of strict sufficiency. They must remain adapted to a wide variety of situations and continue to offer the Head of State a sufficiently wide range of mode of action. To achieve this, deterrence will continue to rely on the airborne and oceanic components. Bringing together three nuclear forces with their own characteristics, they allow, through their complementarity and their differentiated assets, a wide range of options and a high level of flexibility and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;23-protection--resilience&quot;&gt;2.3 PROTECTION — RESILIENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;78) The implementation of a strategic function dedicated to protection-resilience is now essential. The notions of protection and resilience complement each other, with resilience being an indispensable prerequisite for ensuring the protection of the French people and the national territory and guaranteeing the continuity of the essential functions of the Nation. This function requires enhanced cooperation with our allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;79) This protection function primarily concerns the national territory in metropolitan and overseas, as well as areas where French communities are heavily established or exposed abroad. This geographical dimension alone is no longer sufficient to respond to the nation’s vulnerabilities, given the dependence of our economy on strategic supplies and energy flows, as well as the hybrid strategies developed by France’s strategic competitors. The protection-resilience function must also include the new missions induced by the consequences of climate change and the degradation of biodiversity: food when used as a weapon, power and self-sufficiency, protection and security of value chains, assistance to our populations, securing territories and EEZ, considering chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats, manipulation of information, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;80) All state institutions contribute to the implementation of this function. For their part, the armed forces are permanently engaged on a daily basis to protect the national territory and the French people within the framework of their State action missions at sea or in the air, domestic missions and their own military operations. They ensure permanent air and maritime security postures (PASP and PMSP), which guarantee national sovereignty in air and maritime spaces, and help secure supply and communication routes. These day-to-day measures are reinforced according to the threat or particular events. The resurgence of unfriendly behaviour in our territorial approaches requires robust means of detection, remediation and response, including in space and in cyberspace. The capabilities of the armed forces thus need to be strengthened and structured as part of the overall state effort to deal with large-scale crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;24-prevention&quot;&gt;2.4 PREVENTION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;81) Prevention concerns both the national territory and France’s action outside its borders. Its implementation includes both the development of national and international standards and the fight against trafficking and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, for disarmament and peace-building. Supporting the stabilisation of states in crisis contributes to conflict prevention and limits the cost of further intervention. The prevention function is based on a wide range of potential crisis or escalation scenarios, covering the top end of the spectrum and competition between great powers, as well as the manifestations of rapidly changing conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;82) The pre-positioning of military forces plays a key role in the exercise of the prevention function, as it does for other strategic functions. The presence of French military forces in third countries, in agreement with them, contributes directly to this objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;83) The security and defence cooperation mechanism is an indirect lever for preventing future crises. This cooperation takes the form of assistance to allied partner forces to provide them with the capabilities to assert their own sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;84) The prevention function must be articulated with the intervention function. This articulation is embodied in the capacity to signify determination, clarify intentions and discourage opponents — including in the field of perceptions — to “win the war before the war”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;25-intervention&quot;&gt;2.5 INTERVENTION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;85) The intervention function serves three purposes: to ensure the protection of our nationals abroad; to defend our priority interests and those of our partners and allies; and to live up to our international responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;86) It gives France’s security the strategic depth it needs, but also the broader credibility it needs to ensure the reliability of its alliances and its ability to train in coalitions as a framework nation. While French armies retain a capacity to act alone, the normal framework for their engagement outside the territory is that of collective action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;87) In addition to the resources necessary for the protection of the national territory, the armed forces have the capacity to engage in priority areas for the defence and security of France: the European periphery, the area from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, part of Africa — from the Sahel to equatorial Africa — the Arabian Gulf and the Indo-Pacific. France must now resolve the issue of the strategic extension of its forces, and therefore the use of support points to which the pre-positioned forces, the overseas sovereignty forces and its strategic partnerships are attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;88) The intervention function cannot be separated from the other functions, especially in a high-intensity engagement. Whether it is the knowledge-appreciation-anticipation function (anticipating and characterising threats to allow a wide range of options), prevention (the value of signalling our active deployments), protection-resilience (securing our supply chains) and deterrence (the concept of support between conventional posture and nuclear deterrence), the intervention function translates into multi-location and multi-field actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;26-influence&quot;&gt;2.6 INFLUENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;89) The strategic function of influence aims to promote and defend the interests and values of France. This is an essential part of the expression of power. In this respect, France has many assets. It has a major political weight due to its seat as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), its status as nuclear-weapon state and its overseas presence, a complete army model and troops deployed on many continents, its economic attractiveness, the French language spoken by 300 million people, a positive image due to our cultural influence, global projection supported by the universality of the diplomatic, cultural and educational network, our security partnerships, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;90) The new dimension given to the capacity to influence takes note of an acceleration and hardening of competition and contestation in all fields, particularly in that of perceptions. The aggressiveness shown by our competitors reminds us that nothing can be taken for granted: in addition to our diplomatic, economic and strategic interests, the new battles for influence involve our ability to maintain the French and European model and to ensure that France’s commitment on the international stage is understood and accepted. We therefore need to take on the balance of power more directly in this field to defend the national interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;91) Influence is first and foremost part of a long-term strategy. A global policy conducted and coordinated at the interministerial level, it relies on capacities that support and legitimise our positions and our action, which must be deployed in all possible fields (training of foreign military personnel and coordination of networks, contribution to university research, aid to economic development, etc.). It also requires knowledge of the levers of influence deployed by our partners, competitors and adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;92) Integral to the other strategic functions described in this review, the influence function must be embodied in a national influence strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;93) Following on from the 2021 Roadmap for Influence, this national strategy will set the general framework for action by all the actors concerned, determine the intentions and provide guidance for the national sectoral and/or geographical strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;94) This strategy will aim to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;defend France’s long-term interests as well as universal values, the application of international law, multilateralism and the preservation of common goods;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;promote and enhance its commitments in all areas;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;respond or retaliate to manoeuvres or to attacks, particularly in the information field, against our interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-impacts-of-the-recent-context-on-frances-security-interests&quot;&gt;3. IMPACTS OF THE RECENT CONTEXT ON FRANCE’S SECURITY INTERESTS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;95) The return of high intensity conflict, including on European territory, the increasingly unbridled expression of the desire for power on the part of our strategic competitors and the weakening of international regulatory frameworks constrain our choices and pose an unprecedented risk to France’s priority security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;96) The attacks on our strategic autonomy are increasing. Our strategic competitors seek to make use of our dependencies, and to undermine our sovereign judgement and national cohesion in order to shape our understanding of situations and constrain our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;97) The achievement of European sovereignty is essential to the defence of our interests, particularly in this period marked by a tendency towards inward-looking isolation that deeply affects the major players in the international community. Our partnerships and alliances are both one of France’s main assets on the international scene and one of the targets favoured by our strategic competitors to weaken us. The COVID-19 pandemic and then the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine have demonstrated the centrality of our partnerships and alliances in developing a common understanding of the challenges and providing appropriate responses. The Strategic Compass for the European Union and the update of NATO’s Strategic Concept set out clear roadmaps, which must now be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;98) The defence of a stable international order, based on the rule of law and multilateralism, has underpinned our security and prosperity since 1945. The activism of revisionist powers and the project they are carrying out, centred on the balance of power and the fait accompli, is not acceptable: our security interests require ensuring the continuity of our strategic supplies, our freedom of action in the common spaces and our sovereignty in the digital space, as well as an ambitious commitment to arms control and non-proliferation. These objectives must be based on collective and respected rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;general-ambition-for-2030&quot;&gt;General ambition for 2030&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;99) France affirms its ambition to be a balancing power on the international scene by 2030, having strengthened its influence in its areas of interest. It aims to be a driving force for European strategic autonomy in a Europe capable of facing crises and implementing solutions that guarantee its own security, in particular through a credible European defence that complements the Atlantic alliance. Finally, it fulfils its security responsibilities by aiming to preserve effective multilateral mechanisms based on international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100) This strategic ambition must be deployed through the prism of the fracturing of the world order, highlighted in particular by the war in Ukraine. This context calls into question the current French armed-forces model, which was designed according to a logic that was mainly expeditionary. This model in 2030 will have to provide France with the capacity to deal with the need for increased prevention and influence, a possible return to high-intensity interstate conflict, and the hybrid strategies deployed by our competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;101) In 2030, France:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is capable of defending its metropolitan and overseas territory, and of protecting and involving its citizens. This permanent ambition is based on an independent, credible and coherent nuclear deterrent, the keystone of our defence policy, supported by robust conventional armed forces. Permanent security postures adapted to the threats and involving the internal security forces and a dynamic national resilience strategy also contribute to this;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;contributes to the defence of Europe and to stability in the Mediterranean by having the capability to engage in high-intensity conflict. It can assume the role of a framework nation within a NATO, EU or ad hoc coalition;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;acts in the framework of balanced partnerships, providing security, in an area stretching from sub-Saharan Africa to the Arabian Gulf, via the Horn of Africa. Together with its allies, it offers its partner armies a diversified and orchestrated range of courses and training. From a network of suitable support bases, it retains a capacity for intervention or coalition support;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;contributes through its influence and with its partners to the stability of the Indo-Pacific area. In it, it defends its sovereignty and respect for international law;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ensures its freedom of action in common spaces (cyber, space, seabed, air and sea) and the security of its supply routes, together with its partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;102) To achieve this, France has set itself ten strategic objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a robust and credible nuclear deterrent;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a united and resilient France;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;an economy that contributes to the spirit of defence;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;top-ranked cyber resilience;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;France, an exemplary ally in the Euro-Atlantic area;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;France, one of the drivers of European strategic autonomy;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;France, a partner of reliable sovereignty and credible security provider;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;guaranteed autonomy of assessment and decision-making sovereignty;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a capacity to defend and act in hybrid fields;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;freedom of action and the ability to conduct military operations, including high-intensity operations, autonomously or in coalition, in all fields.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ten-strategic-objectives&quot;&gt;Ten Strategic Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-1&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 1&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;a-robust-and-credible-nuclear-deterrent&quot;&gt;A robust and credible nuclear deterrent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;103) The effectiveness of French deterrence policy depends on its political, operational and technical credibility. This is reflected in a demanding posture and long-term capability commitments, but also in the ability, which has been widely demonstrated since its inception, to adapt both doctrine and resources to the strategic context and its potential changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;104) France’s deterrence policy must therefore take into account the global trends that are unfolding in the technological field as well as through hybrid forms of conflict: on the one hand, the capability developments of our competitors (air and missile defences, space, hypervelocity weapons, underwater surveillance, etc.) must constantly inform our thinking on deterrence; on the other hand, the modes of hybrid action, already at work in peacetime, are likely to affect the environment — political, normative, informational, etc. — within which deterrence is exercised and must be the subject of constant reflection on the means of countering them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-the-european-dimension-of-the-french-deterrent&quot;&gt;1. THE EUROPEAN DIMENSION OF THE FRENCH DETERRENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;105) The conflict in Ukraine is an indication of the essential role our nuclear forces play in the security of the Euro-Atlantic area. It demonstrates the need to maintain a robust and credible nuclear deterrent to prevent a major war, guarantee France’s freedom of action and preserve its vital interests, which have a European dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-maintaining-an-effective-independent-and-sovereign-deterrent&quot;&gt;2. MAINTAINING AN EFFECTIVE, INDEPENDENT AND SOVEREIGN DETERRENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;106) In this context, it is essential to maintain a credible deterrent, i.e. one that is legitimate, effective and independent, for the period to 2030 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;107) Part of the challenge of preserving the legitimacy of deterrence is to redouble efforts to strengthen the strategic and deterrence culture, both nationally and within the EU and the Alliance, by enabling a wider public to understand deterrence issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;108) At the same time, in accordance with the principle of strict sufficiency, France will continue its action in favour of arms control, non-proliferation and strategic risk reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;109) France has chosen to continue efforts to renew its two components and to ensure that the armed-forces model allows for a sufficiently robust mutual support of nuclear and conventional forces to preserve the freedom of action of the President of the Republic and to avoid circumventing deterrence from below. The war in Ukraine confirms the need to maintain a capacity to understand and constrain the risk of escalation. In addition, building national resilience to all threats will strengthen deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;110) Finally, the independence of the French deterrent must be perpetuated thanks to a reinforced monitoring of the fundamental and applied research teams, of the national industrial fabric linked to the deterrent and to a consolidation of the technical, industrial and operational know-how that is indispensable to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-2&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 2&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;a-united-and-resilient-france&quot;&gt;A united and resilient France&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;111) France must strengthen its resilience in the face of all the security challenges it is likely to face, whether military or non-traditional (information manipulation, climate change, resource predation, pandemics, etc.). This effort must be deployed in metropolitan and overseas France, particularly by promoting the spirit of defence and ensuring national cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-strengthen-frances-capacity-for-resilience-collectively-and-in-depth&quot;&gt;1. STRENGTHEN FRANCE’S CAPACITY FOR RESILIENCE, COLLECTIVELY AND IN DEPTH&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;112) France is implementing its national resilience strategy (NRS). This aims to strengthen its ability to withstand any kind of damage to the normal life of the country. It allows for a precise and efficient connection with several mechanisms with similar objectives, adopted by both the EU and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;113) The NRS defines three fundamental objectives: to prepare the State in depth for crises; to develop human resources and material capacities to deal with them, by including an overall study on the question of strategic stocks and the diversification of supply sources; and to adapt public communication to the challenges of resilience. This strategy must now be extended to local and regional authorities, companies, associations and the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-promoting-a-sustainable-spirit-of-defence-in-society-and-the-state&quot;&gt;2. PROMOTING A SUSTAINABLE SPIRIT OF DEFENCE IN SOCIETY AND THE STATE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;114) The individual moral strengths of the citizen, especially our youth, are the foundation of collective resilience. They should be strengthened in the educational field, in order to increase the skills that strengthen the resilience of society (transmission of republican values, first aid, etc.). As part of the interministerial dynamic, the armed forces contribute to the promotion of remembrance and help to spread the spirit of defence among young people. The ministries concerned will mobilise to support the ramping up of the universal national service (UNS) to provide a national pool of resilience. Finally, the overhaul of the reserve system will be undertaken globally beyond the National Guard (army and internal security forces).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;115) The attractiveness of the military must be strengthened, by supporting and compensating for the constraints of military life in order to consolidate the spirit of defence, forged as early as possible in the educational sphere, in concrete and rewarding approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;116) Military uniqueness, which is essential to enable the armed forces to prepare and ensure the defence of the homeland and the higher interests of the Nation, must be preserved, particularly from the increasing normative pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-develop-synergy-between-the-ministry-of-the-armed-forces-and-all-services-of-the-state&quot;&gt;3. DEVELOP SYNERGY BETWEEN THE MINISTRY OF THE ARMED FORCES AND ALL SERVICES OF THE STATE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;117) The prospect of a major crisis or even a high-intensity confrontation involving France makes it necessary to raise the level of ambition in terms of national resilience, in particular by developing a better understanding of mutual resilience between the armed forces and the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;118) The armed forces are able to participate in the management of any major crisis with a high degree of responsiveness within the framework of a strengthened civil-military dialogue. The general economy of Operation Sentinel must be rethought in order to guarantee the freedom of action of the armed forces while responding to new security challenges. A renewal of the Operational Defence of the Territory (ODT) concept will also be undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;119) The commitment of the entire nation must be strengthened by increasing awareness of national defence and security issues among public officials, continuous training of crisis management actors, consolidation of the network of senior defence and security officials (SDSO), and the commitment of all ministries to ensure the support of armed forces engaged in a high intensity conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;120) This synergy between a population imbued with the spirit of defence and public actors experienced in planning and crisis management will make it possible to strengthen national resilience in the fields of security, the economy, employment and social cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-3&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 3&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;an-economy-contributing-to-the-spirit-of-defence&quot;&gt;An economy contributing to the spirit of defence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;121) Setting up an economy that contributes to the spirit of defence requires knowing how to mobilise all the resources of the Nation, in order to transform into a war economy, i.e. to organise itself so that French industry can support a war effort in the long term, in case of necessity for the armed forces or for the benefit of a partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-securing-critical-supplies-and-matching-stocks-to-production-capacity&quot;&gt;1. SECURING CRITICAL SUPPLIES AND MATCHING STOCKS TO PRODUCTION CAPACITY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;122) To sustain a war effort over the long term (high consumption of ammunition, attrition, etc.) the best compromise is to be sought by acting on three main levers: the constitution of strategic stocks (complete equipment but also raw materials and critical components); the relocation of the most sensitive production lines; and the diversification of supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;123) In addition, joint stocks of components or raw materials could be set up on the initiative and under the responsibility of industry to support military industrial activities in the event of a conflict, or civilian activities in the event of an economic or health crisis. The development of recycling channels should also contribute to a circular economy, reducing the need for supply and contributing to sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;124) Securing the supply of critical resources could benefit from European initiatives such as the RePowerEU action plan and its variations on raw materials (Raw Material Act) and on components (Chips Act), while respecting French sovereign interests and environmental requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;125) In order to ensure the capacity of its government responsibilities, the State must be able to impose priorities or requisitions on the national market, depending on the evolution of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;126) Since security stability is a condition for the sustainability of our society, the defence technological and industrial base (DTIB) must be able to benefit from favourable financing tools, including in the context of the development of sustainable finance. Thus, future standards for taxonomy or environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria should not discourage investment in defence industry companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;127) Finally, the health crisis and the Ukrainian conflict have shown the importance of having secure and redundant sources of supply. Thus, the relocation of production and recycling facilities on European and national territory must be encouraged and supported in order to remedy the most critical dependence on materials, components, etc. This is the subject of in-depth work in the context of the work on the war economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-reducing-production-and-support-cycles-for-the-gradual-rise-of-the-war-economy&quot;&gt;2. REDUCING PRODUCTION AND SUPPORT CYCLES FOR THE GRADUAL RISE OF THE “WAR ECONOMY”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;128) In addition to the acquisition, over the next few years, of the most critical equipment necessary to face a high-intensity conflict or susceptible to rapid attrition, a war economy preparation plan is being developed in order to adapt the DTIB to the different geopolitical contexts in a gradual and adjustable manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;129) Taking into account these geopolitical contexts must also be reflected in the EU and NATO defence capability tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-implementing-regulatory-normative-procurement-and-support-process-simplifications-from-a-point-of-view-of-risk-management&quot;&gt;3. IMPLEMENTING REGULATORY, NORMATIVE, PROCUREMENT AND SUPPORT PROCESS SIMPLIFICATIONS FROM A POINT OF VIEW OF RISK MANAGEMENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;130) The increasing and proactive use of innovation and value analysis in the work between the Defence procurement agency and the armed forces must enable the forces to be equipped with the most appropriate solutions while taking an acceptable risk in use and achieving the best balance between operational gains, financial gains and time gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-4&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 4&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;first-rate-cyber-resilience&quot;&gt;First-rate cyber resilience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;131) In the face of strategic developments, the focus must be on improving our cyber resilience. There is no way to envisage a cyber shield that would thwart any cyber-attack on France, but strengthening its level of cyber security is essential to prepare the country for more threats. Similarly, the application of a deterrent approach in cyberspace that would force any attacker to restrain himself against France is illusory, but adopting response strategies that mobilise all the levers of the State, both European and international, makes it possible to make cyberattacks particularly costly for the attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;132) This cyber resilience consists in having adapted and organised capacities, that can prevent or, if necessary, reduce the impact and duration of cyber-attacks against France, at least for the most critical functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-improving-frances-cyber-resilience-a-condition-of-sovereignty&quot;&gt;1. IMPROVING FRANCE’S CYBER RESILIENCE, A CONDITION OF SOVEREIGNTY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;133) The efforts undertaken in the public and private sectors must be amplified. Notwithstanding the important work already undertaken, the State’s cybersecurity has significant room for improvement. In some critical sectors, large-scale attacks are still plausible, even if the investments made under the France Recovery plan have considerably improved the level of cyber security. As for the systemic role of certain digital actors, it is still insufficiently taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-consolidating-the-achievements-of-the-french-model&quot;&gt;2. CONSOLIDATING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE FRENCH MODEL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;134) The fundamental achievements of the French model, established in 2008 and regularly reinforced and adapted, must be consolidated. The governance of the State’s digital security has been renovated and can now be deployed. The national capacity to design and implement public policies is illustrated by the creation of regional incident response teams (CSIRT), the opening of the Cyber Campus and the emergence of a cyber defence ecosystem in Rennes. Finally, following its presidency of the Council of the European Union, France is recognised by its peers as exemplary on cybersecurity issues. The challenge now is to ensure that the EU directives for mass cybersecurity adopted under the FPEU are implemented as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-investing-over-the-long-term-to-reach-the-highest-level-of-cyber-resilience&quot;&gt;3. INVESTING OVER THE LONG TERM TO REACH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CYBER RESILIENCE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;135) The level of cybersecurity of all public services needs to be raised significantly. This will necessarily involve investments to consolidate a homogeneous and secure digital base for the State and to strengthen institutions and administrations that are still too fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;136) France’s action must be increased by relying on a dynamic public and private cyber ecosystem. The State cannot act alone on cybersecurity issues and must be able to mobilise all actors in the event of a major crisis. Particular attention will be paid to prevention and to assistance to all victims of malicious cyberattacks. Finally, this ecosystem must be based on a competitive national and European cyber defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;137) All actors in the digital world must be trained and made aware of the cyber risk. The aim is to mobilise the general public, systematically integrate it into educational curricula and strengthen the attractiveness of the professions in the sector. Efforts must also be made to ensure the accountability of digital service providers and the security of supply chains, particularly that of the State. Finally, France can support and encourage the emergence of robust and sovereign trustworthy offers at both national and European level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;138) Lastly, France’s resilience depends on that of its European and international partners and on the security and stability of cyberspace as a whole. It is therefore necessary to contribute to raising the level of resilience of European and international institutions and of France’s partners, as well as to pursue the structuring of a European market for cybersecurity products and services. On the international scene, France must put forward proposals to control the trade and fight against the proliferation of cyber weapons, in particular through better use of export control tools for goods and technologies. In addition, a common standard for cyber crisis management, as well as cooperation and mutual assistance mechanisms, would enable states to avoid the risks of misunderstanding and uncontrolled escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;france-an-exemplary-ally-in-the-euro-atlantic-area&quot;&gt;France, an exemplary ally in the Euro-Atlantic area&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;139) NATO is a political and military alliance that plays a key role in European security through its main mission of collective defence and, in particular, the assistance clause in Article 5 of the 1949 Treaty. The transatlantic link remains essential for the security of the Euro-Atlantic area and consequently that of France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-contributing-to-increasing-the-operational-added-value-of-the-alliance&quot;&gt;1. CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASING THE OPERATIONAL ADDED VALUE OF THE ALLIANCE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;140) France will continue to contribute fully to all the missions of the Atlantic Alliance, assuming its role within the military structures and operations, as it is doing in the context of the war in Ukraine, in the Baltic States and in Romania. It will contribute to their responsiveness and adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;141) France wishes to confirm the Alliance’s key role in the defence of Europe. NATO strengthens the potential of armies and is the forum for addressing interoperability challenges as well as capability, technological and operational expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-enhance-the-key-and-unique-role-of-france-within-the-alliance&quot;&gt;2. ENHANCE THE KEY AND UNIQUE ROLE OF FRANCE WITHIN THE ALLIANCE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;142) France intends to maintain a unique position within the Alliance. It has a demanding and visible position because of the specificity and independence of its defence policy, in particular because of its nuclear deterrent. On the strength of its operational credibility, its unique ability to act urgently at a high level and its financial contribution, which is among the largest in the Alliance, France intends to strengthen its influence and that of the European allies in order to weight with them on the major changes in NATO’s posture and the future of strategic stability in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;143) Concerned about the coherence and cohesion of the Alliance, France will continue to contribute in a proactive, realistic and sustainable way to the strengthening of the posture on the eastern flank — including as a framework nation — and to the adaptation of NATO’s command structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-driving-eu-nato-cooperation&quot;&gt;3. DRIVING EU-NATO COOPERATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;144) France is working to strengthen the European pillar of the Alliance in a pragmatic approach to its role, which excludes an extension to other geographical areas and in particular the Indo-Pacific. The guarantee provided by NATO’s collective defence mission remains the central pillar of security in the Euro-Atlantic area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;145) Defence investment, in line with the 2014 Wales Summit commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence, must continue to increase in Europe. This level should be seen as a floor to match the strategic disruption caused by the war in Ukraine and the capabilities needed by the European allies to ensure their security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;146) This collective effort also involves the creation, at EU level, of the necessary incentives for capability and industrial cooperation between European states. These contribute to the strengthening of the continent’s resilience, which is essential for the Alliance’s effectiveness, but also for the sustainability of a robust, agile European DTIB (EDTIB) capable of meeting the operational needs of European armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;147) France supports a modernisation, widening and deepening of the EU-NATO partnership, to take account of the new security challenges facing Europe and the forthcoming accession of Finland and Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;france-one-of-the-driving-forces-behind-european-strategic-autonomy&quot;&gt;France, one of the driving forces behind European strategic autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;148) France and all European countries share the same security challenges. The adoption of an ambitious strategic compass in March 2022 and the major role played by the EU since the start of the war in Ukraine demonstrate both the power of our levers and the distance we still have to travel. It is necessary to bring about the emergence of a sovereign Europe, endowed with a common strategic culture, with a capacity for evaluation and autonomous action in the service of the shared interests of Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-coming-together-around-a-european-strategic-autonomy&quot;&gt;1. COMING TOGETHER AROUND A EUROPEAN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;149) France plays a key role in strengthening European sovereignty, notably through its triple membership of the EU, NATO and the UNSC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;150) France is first of all working towards a convergence of views in the assessment of situations between Europeans, all of whom have different strategic cultures or political priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;151) France then supports the renewal of the European partnership policy initiated with the adoption of the strategic compass. It goes hand in hand with the strengthening of the EU’s defence relations with countries in Africa and the Indo-Pacific and, in the case of the United States and the United Kingdom, with the implementation of balanced relations supported by regular and intensive defence and security dialogues. Increased, sustainable and durable EU-NATO complementarity must be sought. France must play a leading role in this, promoting closer cooperation in certain key areas, such as military mobility, cyber and hybrid threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;152) Finally, the EU’s cohesion in its support for Ukraine is a priority. It is imperative that Europeans remain united and proactive, both on sanctions and in support of the Ukrainian armed and security forces. The continuation of a high level of military assistance over time through the provision of equipment and appropriate training is crucial. This consistency is necessary for Europe to remain capable of influencing the resolution of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-bringing-european-defence-industrial-capabilities-to-the-fore&quot;&gt;2. BRINGING EUROPEAN DEFENCE INDUSTRIAL CAPABILITIES TO THE FORE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;153) The EU must continue on the path towards greater technological autonomy which goes hand in hand with the development of the European defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;154) European strategic autonomy depends on robust European defence industrial capabilities that meet its own needs. France supports the setting up of a short-term instrument for the joint acquisition of European equipment. It also supports the creation of a defence investment programme for the joint development and procurement of critical and innovative equipment. The central role of the European Defence Agency (EDA) must be reaffirmed and all existing instruments must be mobilised: the European Defence Fund (EDF), the Coordinated Annual Defence Review (CARD), Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), the Hub for European Defence Innovation (HEDI). In addition, the provisions related to the social taxonomy must consider the specificity and needs of the EDTIB, which is a central component of European strategic autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;155) These efforts must be accompanied by structural and decisive progress in common capability projects with the objective of an independent EDTIB and common choices among Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-strengthening-the-eus-and-europeans-own-capacity-to-act&quot;&gt;3. STRENGTHENING THE EU’S AND EUROPEANS’ OWN CAPACITY TO ACT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;156) Europe must be supported in its role as a global player, a credible defender of free access to contested spaces (sea, space, cyber, air, seabed) in the face of the hybrid strategies of its competitors. With the right strategies and capabilities, it is able to protect the citizens of the Member States, to interact and, where necessary, to intervene on all continents in strict compliance with the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;157) The Union’s normative power must be exploited as a lever of influence in a more competitive environment, in order to guard against hybrid threats and other forms of foreign interference, be it “lawfare”, commodity blackmail or information manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;158) In this sense, France supports the instruments developed by the European institutions: hybrid toolbox, foreign information manipulation and interference — FIMI — toolbow, anti-economic coercion regulation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;159) France is contributing to the development of a genuine EU STRATCOM, capable of positioning Europe and European action in relation to its citizens, their representatives, our partners and also our competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;160) The EU must continue to build up its rapid deployment capability. It needs to be able to respond quickly and more robustly in less permissive environments. To this end, France is promoting more flexible decision-making with Article 44 of the EU Treaty and renewed decision-making and control structures (C2), as well as global mandates to act on a broad spectrum: advice, training, equipment, combat support. The Union must have the capacity to mobilise ad hoc formats when necessary, as France has already done with Takuba or EMASoH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;161) France, given its geographical position, its industrial and military capabilities and its national know-how, contributes actively to the development of European airspace protection. Its deterrence is part of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;162) Finally, the European Intervention Initiative (EII) is the crucible for a common strategic culture and enhanced cooperation between its members. Launched in 2018, the format remains fully relevant today to support the increasing responsibility of Europeans in favour of their own security, resulting in operational commitments in which France can play the role of framework nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;france-a-reliable-sovereignty-partner-and-credible-security-provider&quot;&gt;France, a reliable sovereignty partner and credible security provider&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;163) France is defending an ambitious strategic offer that translates into lucid, balanced and prioritised solidarity with its partners. In a context of exacerbated polarisation and competition, France’s offer to its partners must continue to be distinguished by its high added value and enable it not to be forced into alignment or marginalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-asserting-itself-as-a-lucid-partner-with-high-added-value&quot;&gt;1. ASSERTING ITSELF AS A LUCID PARTNER WITH HIGH ADDED VALUE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-developing-an-inclusive-strategy-in-europe-and-with-the-us&quot;&gt;1.1 DEVELOPING AN INCLUSIVE STRATEGY IN EUROPE AND WITH THE US&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;164) In Europe, France must both recast its relations with its traditional partners and develop an inclusive strategy towards other countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;with Germany, France must deepen its relationship in order to continue to build European defence in the light of Germany’s recently expressed ambitions and the strategic and capability needs we have identified;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Italy and Spain are key partners, both in theatres of operation (Mediterranean, Middle East, Sahel) and in terms of capability cooperation;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;with EU members, France must consolidate several of its strategic partnerships (Greece, Croatia) and, capability partnerships (Belgium) concluded recently, consolidate its links with certain partners (Quirinal Treaty with Italy, Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with Spain), and strengthen its operational cooperation on the basis of shared experiences in the Sahel and in Eastern Europe (countries involved in Operation Barkhane and Takuba TF);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;with partners in the EU neighbourhood (Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia), France must, preferably, contribute to their stability by capitalising on its economic aid and European programmes to support structural reforms;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;with our allies, our space partnerships will be intensified;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;after Brexit, a constructive dialogue on the basis of the bilateral treaties must be quickly re-established with the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;165) With the United States, our strategic partnership will remain fundamental, and must remain ambitious, lucid and pragmatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;12-contributing-to-security-in-africa-through-balanced-partnerships&quot;&gt;1.2 CONTRIBUTING TO SECURITY IN AFRICA THROUGH BALANCED PARTNERSHIPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;166) Faced with the evolution of the terrorist threat and the growing influence of our strategic competitors across the continent, France wishes to forge renewed partnerships in Africa based on African partners’ requests and by integrating more civilian based cooperation along a security, defence, diplomacy and development continuum, as declared in the summer of 2017. They should contribute to a better understanding of security issues and build, in the long term, a stronger strategic proximity with African armies that wish to do so, particularly in view of the renegotiation of several major treaties. Coordination with our European and international partners will continue to be essential in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;13-adopting-an-ambitious-partnership-strategy-in-the-mediterranean-and-the-red-sea&quot;&gt;1.3 ADOPTING AN AMBITIOUS PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND THE RED SEA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;167) Given the increased competition and militarisation in the Mediterranean-Red Sea continuum, France needs to strengthen its reassurance measures, support EU and NATO missions and operations, and enhance the effectiveness and level of capability cooperation with all countries in the area. The densification of certain strategic or reference partnerships will also enable France to guarantee its freedom of manoeuvre, the continuity of its supply chains and regional stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;14-contributing-to-regional-stability-and-securing-flows-in-the-arabian-gulf&quot;&gt;1.4 CONTRIBUTING TO REGIONAL STABILITY AND SECURING FLOWS IN THE ARABIAN GULF&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;168) A revitalisation of France’s partnerships in the Gulf is necessary to cope with the structuring of new strategic agreements, American disengagement and the increase in regional rivalries. France must be able, with and through its partners, to hinder and counter the destabilising activities of certain regional actors and to secure its own footprint, in particular by signing security arrangements in the fields of counter-terrorism, intelligence and armaments. France must also continue to support defence and security equipment procurement projects while strengthening the fight against the diversion of war materials, the dissemination of conventional weapons and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;15-enhancing-our-ability-to-contribute-to-maintaining-strategic-stability-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;1.5 ENHANCING OUR ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO MAINTAINING STRATEGIC STABILITY IN THE INDO-PACIFIC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;169) France’s role as a balancing power in the Indo-Pacific must be reaffirmed. To this end, France is committed to building partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region, notably India, Australia and Japan, as well as Indonesia and Singapore. It develops its capacities of anticipation and strategic signalling, vis-à-vis its competitors, reaffirms and strengthens its position in the politico-military multilateralism of the region, by increasing its training capacity and, if necessary, by promoting the emergence of ad hoc structures. France will also promote the implementation of the EU’s strategy for the region and its partnership with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-preventing-an-arms-race-the-proliferation-of-weapons-of-mass-destruction-and-the-spread-of-conventional-weapons&quot;&gt;2. PREVENTING AN ARMS RACE, THE PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND THE SPREAD OF CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;170) France defends the centrality and credibility of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the sustainability of the four multilateral export control regimes covering chemical and biological, nuclear, ballistic and conventional weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;171) It is continuing to invest in the intelligence needed to hinder illicit or destabilising flows, with a particular focus on intangibles, which are particularly vulnerable to cyber actions, while developing countermeasures to CBRN threats in order to promote resilience in the face of possible attacks against its forces, interests or territory. It also strengthens its capacity for action to counteract these illicit or destabilising flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-8&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 8&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;guaranteed-autonomy-of-judgement-and-decision-making-sovereignty&quot;&gt;Guaranteed autonomy of judgement and decision-making sovereignty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;172) In an increasingly competitive and complex international context, France must focus its efforts on raising its level of knowledge, understanding of competitors or adversaries, and anticipating their intentions. This performance requirement calls for developing the agile orientation of the intelligence services while preserving the universality and effectiveness of the diplomatic and consular network. It also requires continued investment in the technological capabilities to exploit the ever-increasing volume of data, in order to share relevant information with the decision-making and action levels in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-developing-agile-intelligence-and-surveillance-capabilities&quot;&gt;1. DEVELOPING AGILE INTELLIGENCE AND SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;173) Intelligence services have to monitor, analyse and understand an increasing number of geographical areas and issues. They must anticipate crises, technological and military capability disruptions, the terrorist threat, the CBRN threat, the defence and promotion of national economic and industrial interests, in particular DTIB companies, and the fight against hybrid or transversal threats. One of the decisive challenges is to articulate the continuation of their action in the fight against terrorism and in support of military operations, with reinvestment in areas of strategic rivalry, in particular continental Europe and the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;174) The effectiveness and agility of the intelligence services depend on ambitious reforms, long-term investments and an acceleration of coordination and intelligence exchange loops, including with the armed forces in operations. The continuation of the in-depth transformations already underway — in particular the external security general directorate and the Military intelligence directorate, following the example of the international security general directorate — must be accompanied by an ambitious human resources policy in the intelligence professions, in order to attract, retain and develop a common culture and inter-service mobility. It is also essential to ensure the universality of the diplomatic network and to strengthen its means of analysis and anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-building-technical-capacity&quot;&gt;2. BUILDING TECHNICAL CAPACITY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;175) The preservation of French sovereignty in the face of technological change requires new investments in capabilities. The growing diversity of tools and the acceleration of technological advances offer new opportunities, provided that the necessary investments are made, according to a logic of mutualisation when the missions allow it. The reactivity of the knowledge-appreciation-anticipation function must be amplified by increased interconnection around secure communication tools, ensuring technical interoperability with the main foreign partners on a case-by-case basis, particularly within the EU and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;176) The new technical tools will have to use the potential of quantum computing and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-9&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 9&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;a-capacity-to-defend-and-act-in-hybrid-fields&quot;&gt;A capacity to defend and act in hybrid fields&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;177) France’s main strategic competitors use hybrid strategies, deliberately ambiguous combinations of direct and indirect, military and non-military, legal and illegal, and often difficult-to-attribute modes of action. These strategies can have important consequences for democracies as they aim to delegitimise them, weaken their moral strength and cohesion or reduce their economic and national defence potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;178) Faced with these threats and in order to defend its fundamental interests, France must perfect its organisation, be able to respond in all fields of hybridity and protect its most critical infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-improving-our-organisation&quot;&gt;1. IMPROVING OUR ORGANISATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;179) France must be capable of countering and controlling the effects of these hybrid aggressions, while respecting its principles and values. To achieve this, a more agile, responsive and integrated organisation will be adopted to identify, characterise, trigger appropriate protection mechanisms and develop responses in a more multi-sectoral approach. In line with the EU’s strategic compass and the NATO 2030 concept, France also relies on its allies and partners to benefit from leverage in its fight against hybrid threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;180) This organisation is based on a national strategy of influence which must include the actions carried out in a global approach and over time to enhance France’s commitments but also to respond or retaliate effectively to informational manoeuvres or attacks against its interests. It mobilises its public diplomacy, particularly in Africa. A strategic communication is developed in order to convey a coherent, credible and effective message to competitors, partners or allies and to national and international public opinion. It can be coordinated with allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-act&quot;&gt;2. ACT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;181) In the field of the fight against information manipulation by foreign competitors, France must have a wide range of response options, beyond public attribution, as is the case in the cyber field. France is fighting against the use of law and norms as a strategic tool (lawfare) by its competitors. It supports the adoption of European tools to combat extraterritoriality. France is developing tools to fight back against private military companies, armed groups or militias used as intermediaries — proxies — by hostile powers in order to multiply their actions of contestation or competition, while maintaining plausible deniability. Dissemination of information, national or European sanctions, legal proceedings or even military actions may target these groups if they carry out activities detrimental to French interests or if they are responsible for human rights violations and war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-strengthening-the-protection-of-critical-infrastructure&quot;&gt;3. STRENGTHENING THE PROTECTION OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;182) In the face of hybrid threats, the protection of our critical infrastructures is a priority. Among them, underwater and space communication infrastructures require a special effort to develop the means of detection, characterisation, deterrence and even obstruction of malicious actions. Finally, France wishes to promote the development of leading French industrial players, world leaders in the field of submarine communication cables and space operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-objective-10&quot;&gt;Strategic objective 10&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;freedom-of-action-and-ability-to-conduct-military-operations-including-high-intensity-operations-in-all-fields-multi-environment-and-multi-field&quot;&gt;Freedom of action and ability to conduct military operations, including high-intensity operations in all fields (multi-environment and multi-field)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;183) The freedom of action of the forces depends on the ability to anticipate, detect and appreciate the intentions of France’s adversaries. It underpins the national capacity to show determination, to discourage hostile action or prevent the imposition of a fait accompli, and to engage in confrontation if necessary. It allows for the robust backing of nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;184) It must be preserved from the competition phase onwards, in an ever-wider spectrum, because the strategies of France’s competitors and adversaries are expressed in a growing number of fields (outer space and cyber, seabed, electromagnetic and information fields).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;185) France must maintain and further develop its capacities to decide and command, to federate and mobilise, to act and last, to invest in common spaces and to face uninhibited competitors, taking into account its interests, its place on the international scene and its global ambition, but also its means. These capacities are necessarily differentiated according to the geographical areas and common spaces considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-deciding-and-ordering&quot;&gt;1. DECIDING AND ORDERING&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;186) France enjoys a complete and autonomous capacity for assessment and understanding as required to support political and military decisions. The armed forces have trained and deployable command capabilities to plan, conduct and control multi-environment and multi-field operations in autonomy and in coalition when France is a framework nation at the operational level. A permanent and agile reorganized command structure controls the day-to-day and contingency operations that contribute to safeguarding its strategic interests, its metropolitan and overseas territories, its aerospace, air and sea and aeronautical approaches, and its energy supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-uniting-and-contributing&quot;&gt;2. UNITING AND CONTRIBUTING&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;187) In Africa, the Near and Middle East, and the Indian Ocean, France is able to mobilise or accompany its partners, to constrain or discourage an aggressor by offering a command and support capability to the forces. It honours its commitments there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;188) In the Pacific zone, France has the means, in coordination with its partners, to discourage or hinder a competitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;189) In Central and South America, the Arctic and Antarctic, it preserves its freedom of action, the security of its flows and its interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;190) The armed forces are constantly working to develop and maintain interoperability with allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-act-and-last&quot;&gt;3. ACT AND LAST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;191) The armed forces protect the French people against a dangerous world, participate in their daily protection and contribute to the preservation of national interests. In particular, they hold permanent positions of deterrence, air safety and maritime protection and take part in missions on national territory (including DROM-COM with sovereignty forces) in addition to or in support of internal security or civil security forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;192) The armed forces are prepared for a major engagement and ready to engage in a high-intensity confrontation, particularly in the defence of the euro-atlantic area. They are able to deploy at short notice, able to enter first, with or without possible support from allied countries. They have the capabilities to protect themselves, to last and to cope with high attrition (air superiority and fire superiority). They are able to provide an allied country with the necessary support at short notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;193) They have diversified capabilities for deep strikes in the context of first entry, support to a coalition operation, retaliatory actions, or strategic warning. France is able to target and strike (kinetic or cyber) targets of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;194) Armies have the capacity to generate and aggregate effects in a networked approach from the competition phase onwards across the entire spectrum of conflict, with in particular military and civilian, public and private, institutional and individual, national or allied contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-investing-in-common-spaces&quot;&gt;4. INVESTING IN COMMON SPACES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;195) France is fully present and active in preserving its freedom of action and defending its interests in common spaces that are the object of power rivalries and renewed forms of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;196) Faced with strategic competitors, armies acquire and maintain their freedom of assessment and action in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;197) In space, France maintains its national strategic autonomy in terms of situation assessment, decision-making and the conduct of operations. It ensures its access to the space environment and to assert its interests in this environment, notably through the support of its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

The use of Iranian drones in Ukraine has sparked concern over the deepening Iranian-Russo ties and the maturity of Iran’s drone program. But for Iran, Ukraine serves as another battlefield to live-test its drone fleet against U.S.- and NATO-provided defensive systems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tehran has placed itself firmly in the Kremlin’s camp since the early days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Part of that is driven by the punishing sanctions regime that weighs heavily on both economies and part by a shared interest in weakening the U.S. and NATO. But the nature of Iran’s support shifted when Tehran supplied drones and then began training Russian forces on their use. Reports of the deal surfaced in midsummer and by August, Iranian drones were in Ukraine. The precise terms remain unclear, but Iranian drones offset surveillance demands on the Russian air force and may backfill rapidly depleting missile stockpiles. For Iran, the deal generates cash or repays a debt — but more significantly places its drones in yet another theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drones already provide Iranian forces and regional proxies with critical capabilities, including aerial surveillance and short- and long-range strikes. Their smaller size makes them hard to see on radar, and they are difficult to hit because they fly low and slow — exploiting a gap in defense systems. Some drones function as precision munitions such as the Shahed-136, which earned the moniker of a “kamikaze” drone. Though individual drones carry a relatively low payload, drone swarm technology, which the Iranian military showcased in late 2021, can combine their firepower. The Shahed-136’s mobile, truck-mounted launchers present similar challenges to detection as did Iraq’s Scud launchers in the first Gulf War. Moreover, Iran sources some drone components from commercially available engines and other dual-use technologies, complicating efforts to prevent parts procurement. Indeed, Tehran has called drones “the main pillar of wars of the future” and asserted they will play an increasingly prominent role in its military posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advancement in Iran’s drone threat should be no surprise. While Iranian military drills and reporting may inflate capabilities, Iranian drones have proved their worth in active conflicts. Yemen’s Houthis began using Iranian-sourced drones in 2016. They used a short-range drone to target Patriot air defense systems within the country, neutralizing them before firing missiles at the location. They also used these drones for cross-border attacks against Saudi military and oil infrastructure. Iran introduced longer-range designs that the Houthis tested against Saudi targets, and the first known Shahed-136 surfaced in Yemen by September 2020. Houthi-launched drones and missiles probe Saudi air defenses, primarily Patriot air defense systems, to reveal vulnerabilities that they can then exploit. Iranian drone performance in the Yemen conflict almost certainly has fed back into future development cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feedback cycle makes Russia’s use of Iranian drone technology worrisome. The drones themselves are unlikely to yield strategic shifts in the Ukraine war. The Russian military is attacking civilian and infrastructure targets with drones to break the will of the Ukrainian people, but these attacks seem to have only further inured Ukrainians to Russian brutality. The Ukrainian military is shooting down more than 70 percent of the Shahed-136 drones, using anti-drone techniques developed on the fly. Defensive layers include radar to identify potential drone threats, fighter jet patrols, ground-fired anti-aircraft missiles and even machine-gun fire. The U.S. and NATO supplied Ukraine with anti-drone systems, including the mobile VAMPIRE system, to aid in defense against Russian attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. and NATO will reap the benefits of the Ukrainian military’s experience, so, too, will Iran. Iranians operating the drones from Crimea have front-row seats and can report back which drone attacks have penetrated which defenses, and where gaps in any defense systems may exist. Iran’s next generation of drones will be that much more difficult to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variety of ways in which the Ukrainian military has thwarted Russian drone attacks is a testament to the array of defenses at its disposal. But it also speaks to the ad hoc nature of the response, revealing vulnerabilities to increasingly sophisticated — and field-tested — Iranian technology, and it exposes an asymmetry in defending against the threat. Scrambling fighter jets to shoot down drones as the U.S. did in September is not a sustainable response. Nor, as the Saudis have learned, is firing million-dollar Patriot missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and NATO must commit to advancing their anti-drone capabilities and slowing Iran’s drone program. The Defense Department’s initial steps to develop a strategy and the technologies to support it are positive but remain insufficient as modern warfare moves faster than defense procurement cycles. Congress could help. Funding the military’s efforts to address this growing threat is one way. Another is focusing on the Iranian drone procurement network and those who operate the drones. Sanctioning entities within this network will make it harder for Iran to obtain necessary components. So, too, would ensuring the proper authorities to attack the production cycle through cyber or other means are in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s drone threat is rising, and it’s only a matter of time until the U.S. military, not the Ukrainians, will need to defend against it.&lt;/p&gt;

State Grid is the world’s largest utility company, pursuing an international strategy of expansion that both implements and informs Beijing’s policy goals for global energy infrastructure. By investigating how State Grid acquired a stake in Greece’s national power grid operator, the Chinese financing and energy sector business deals that followed State Grid’s investment, and the constraints that limited State Grid’s later efforts to expand its control over Greece’s electric grid, this case study offers insight to the role of state-owned enterprises in the global reach of China’s state capitalist system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to further explore the “CCP Inc.” framework of Chinese state capitalism, this report examines the illustrative case of State Grid Corporation of China’s (State Grid; 国家电网) initial investment in Greece’s energy sector and its attempts to expand its reach in the country’s electric grid. State Grid’s entrance into the Greek power market — and more particularly, its causes and consequences — demonstrates the considerable power of the CCP Inc. ecosystem to promote Chinese interests in critical overseas markets, beyond what pure state planning could reasonably achieve. As this case study will illustrate, the CCP Inc. ecosystem can enable greater contributions to Chinese political and economic interests than central government directives alone — even as its blurring of the lines between private and state interests can also present political problems for Chinese businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“CCP Inc.” represents an evolution from the past “China Inc.” framework for examining China’s economic statecraft, which focused on the relatively clear lines between the global activities of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and government planning directives, such as national five-year plans and foreign policy initiatives like the “Going Out” strategy to encourage outbound investment. Over the past decade, Chinese state capitalism has evolved into a more complex ecosystem of SOEs, private and hybrid-owned companies, Chinese policy banks, diplomatic actors, and state planners pursuing a mix of national and commercial interests. The CCP Inc. framework examines these added layers of political and commercial actors on top of analyses of the government initiatives, SOEs, and national champions that have traditionally been the central focuses in scholarship on China’s economic statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this complex CCP Inc. ecosystem, the interactions and motivations of Chinese state and commercial actors are not always easily observable. Therefore, this series of case studies examines the circumstances of certain international investments and business deals for insight into how CCP Inc. operates in practice. Some conduits of state influence are clear, such as in diplomatic support for business deals. In other cases, outside observers must rely on indirect evidence, such as suspiciously generous financial arrangements or actions by CCP Inc. actors that are not motivated by obvious economic considerations. In Greece, for example, State Grid was able to massively outbid its commercial opponents, while pursuing a national footprint that aligned both with its own business goals and with central government priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of State Grid’s investment in Greece is an important example of how the CCP Inc. ecosystem has enabled Chinese companies, regulators, banks, and officials to cooperate in pursuit of common commercial and economic goals. Contemporary Sino-Greek economic cooperation is anchored in Greece’s decades-long debt challenges. In the aftermath of the 2008–2009 financial crisis, the Greek and Chinese governments began to accelerate the development of investment plans into Greece — and Chinese companies became a key source of financing. In 2016, State Grid took a 24 percent stake in the Greek national power grid operator, ADMIE (the shortened and anglicized version of the original Greek name for the firm, also known as IPTO). The investment was, at the time, the second-largest Chinese investment in Greece, with State Grid significantly outbidding competitors in early offerings for a stake in ADMIE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key reason for State Grid’s interest in ADMIE was the Greek grid operator’s position in emergent interconnections between international power grids across the Mediterranean, which was aligned with the company’s vision for an interconnected global grid and was discussed in high-level meetings about the ADMIE stake. After State Grid’s initial investment, ADMIE formed new partnerships with Chinese banks, while other Chinese companies made major investments in the Greek energy sector and Chinese firms enjoyed strong diplomatic support for their ventures in Greece. However, State Grid ultimately fell short in its ambitions to expand its footprint in Mediterranean super grids, demonstrating how pushback against CCP Inc. can constrain major SOEs like State Grid. In fact, some features of CCP Inc. that serve to support Chinese companies — namely, state backing and connections to Chinese banks — can also become a liability by reinforcing perceptions of Chinese companies as offshoots of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study proceeds in three parts. Chapter 1 examines State Grid’s entry into the Greek power grid as a minority shareholder in the national grid operator, ADMIE. Chapter 2 expands the aperture to examine how private Chinese renewable energy companies followed State Grid into the Greek power sector. Finally, Chapter 3 reflects on what State Grid’s entry into the Greek market tells us about SOEs in the CCP Inc. framework, and how State Grid’s challenges in expanding its role in the Greek electric grid reflect the limitations of CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-greek-debt-and-chinese-shipping-interests-anchored-chinas-economic-expansion-in-greece&quot;&gt;How Greek Debt and Chinese Shipping Interests Anchored China’s Economic Expansion in Greece&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sino-Greek economic partnership grew rapidly in the 2000s and 2010s, driven chiefly by Greece’s desire for expanded economic partners amid financial troubles, along with the Chinese government’s recognition of the geostrategic opportunities accompanying commercial engagement with a nation that links Europe to the eastern Mediterranean and to the Eurasian continent. In 2008–2009, the global financial crisis caused severe economic stagnation, accelerating the country’s debt crisis by further constraining Greece’s already impaired ability to pay its debts. With the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) growing ever more wary of Greece’s ability to recover, the government needed additional partners. As a result, the Greek government was highly receptive to Chinese investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its part, the Chinese government had long sought further entry points into the European market. For China, Greece’s geographic and political position vis-à-vis the European Union created strong incentives for Chinese companies to gain a foothold in the country as a route through which to access the broader European market. Politically, tensions between Greece and the European Union during Greece’s period of financial crisis created openings for Chinese investments that might have been met with more pushback in other parts of the European Union. Geographically, Greece’s position at the crux of Euro-Asian Sea and land routes presented a critical pull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years after the global financial crisis, the IMF, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission — collectively called the “troika” — required Greece to undergo a series of privatizations as a precondition for receiving bailout money. Among the most significant of these privatizations concerned the port of Piraeus, one of the fastest-growing seaports in Europe, which required external investment to achieve its economic potential and help restore Greece’s maritime economy. Ultimately, Piraeus found the needed funding through China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COSCO is one of China’s oldest and largest SOEs — indeed, it traces its institutional legacy directly to China’s original 53 core SOEs, dating back to the 1950s. It has, in its various incarnations, been one of the central government’s key tools for managing China’s trade since the Mao Zedong era. Throughout its history, COSCO has remained closely affiliated with central planners, including the State Council and the National Development Reform Commission (NDRC) today — not merely in the official bureaucratic hierarchy, but in its regular planning and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, COSCO began a two-phase investment in the port of Piraeus, which would transfer majority ownership of the port to the SOE and would ultimately be labeled by Chinese and European commentators alike as China’s flagship investment in Greece. Under COSCO’s ownership, Piraeus has acted as a beachhead for further Chinese business to enter the Greek market. In 2018, Huawei won the contract to redesign the port’s network infrastructure, while in 2019, COSCO subsidiary OceanRail Logistics acquired Piraeus Europe Asia Rail Logistics (PEARL), and with it, access to run rail in Europe. Moreover, following COSCO’s success in Piraeus, a growing number of Chinese companies went on to offer investments across a range of sectors, including energy — a traditionally sensitive sector given the national security implications of foreign involvement in essential services, such as electricity provision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following COSCO’s acquisition of Piraeus, the next major Chinese investment in Greece would come from another of China’s original 53 core SOEs: State Grid. Like COSCO, State Grid plays a critical role in China’s central economic planning and international economic statecraft; its acquisition of stakes in the Greek national grid operator served both Greek needs for financing and Chinese interests in gaining a foothold in a country at the center of an emerging international cluster of electric grid interconnections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-on-state-grid-and-its-role-in-chinas-international-electricity-strategy&quot;&gt;Background on State Grid and Its Role in China’s International Electricity Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Grid is a behemoth even among China’s central SOEs. By far the larger of China’s two main grid companies, it is the world’s largest utility company, managing power supply to roughly 88 percent of China and covering over 1.1 billion people across 26 provinces. With $613.8 billion (¥4.1 trillion) in total assets as of 2020 — including $46.9 billion (¥316.7 billion) in foreign assets — State Grid is one of the largest companies in the world. Internationally, it ranks as the world’s third-largest company by revenue, surpassed only by Amazon and Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its staggering scale and resources — not to mention its central role in China’s economy — State Grid’s investment decisions are central drivers of China’s energy and industrial outlooks. Most recently, in January 2022, State Grid chairman Xin Bao’an confirmed that in 2022, the company would invest $85.9 billion (¥579.5 billion) domestically, of which $74.3 billion (¥501.2 billion) would go directly to domestic grid upgrades in pursuit of developing a “modern” (i.e., more stable, resilient, and efficient) grid. The amount, while massive, is well within State Grid’s financial means, as it saw $440.0 billion (¥3.0 trillion) in operating income and $7.5 billion (¥50.8 billion) of pure profit in 2021. These figures give just a small window into the SOE’s economic weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politically, State Grid has a long history of being able to leverage both its size and its core role in the economy for behind-the-scenes negotiations with officials in Beijing. Indeed, its sizable investments in grid upgrades strongly tend toward upgrades that will increase revenues, rather than those that will only advance Beijing’s goals. A notable demonstration of this fact is the contrast with its smaller counterpart, China Southern Power Grid (Southern Grid), which manages power supply to just under 12 percent of China’s territory, all in five southern provinces — notably including industrial powerhouse Guangdong. Despite powerful regional interests in coal-fired power, Southern Grid has demonstrated far greater clean energy ambitions than State Grid, both in terms of scale and in terms of timeline for clean energy substitutions. Perhaps most notably, Southern Grid plans for 60 percent of power generated in its service territory to come from non-fossil sources by 2025, compared to State Grid’s targets of 20 percent by 2025 and 25 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, State Grid has, both directly and indirectly, delayed efforts to decarbonize electricity generation — chiefly because these efforts depend critically on fundamental reforms to the current power market regime, a regime from which State Grid benefits massively. An example of State Grid’s dilatory effects on these reforms: One of the primary objectives of China’s 2002 power reforms was for grid companies to divest assets beyond their core business and provide for a clear assessment of the true costs of power transmission and distribution. In the 20 years since, contra Beijing’s reform agenda, State Grid has leveraged its enormous profits from monopolistic market control to systematically accrue new assets in areas such as real estate, media, and finance, making key elements of the 2002 reforms — including electricity pricing reforms — all but impossible. China’s 2015 power market reforms, meanwhile, aimed to introduce private companies into the electricity sales market as a means to increase competition and efficiency — a reform that would massively benefit renewables. But industry insiders have consistently argued that State Grid subsidiaries continue to enjoy unfair advantages, including exclusive data and capital access, to exclude other players from the market. Where the political importance of Xi’s dual carbon goals has forced compliance by virtually every power and resource company in China, State Grid stands alone in being able to meaningfully slow-walk or otherwise resist more substantive green transformation efforts. Central policymakers themselves maintain the same assessment, as demonstrated by their ongoing — and slow-going — attempts to gain greater control over State Grid since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True to its independent nature, State Grid’s overseas expansion has largely been motivated by its economic interests, often buoyed — but generally not driven and rarely constrained — by Beijing’s political goals. State Grid’s primary interest in overseas investment has long stemmed from the fact that China’s relatively rigid electricity pricing system offers far lower returns than those available in countries with liberalized power markets. Multiple analyses in the late 2010s found that State Grid earned double-digit average return on equity (ROE) on foreign assets, which was estimated to be three to five times higher than the ROE on its domestic assets. Meanwhile, demonstrating why State Grid is so reticent to financially depend on its core business, in 2020 the company reportedly lost as much as $1.67 billion on its core domestic operations — but it still saw a nearly $193 million profit thanks to the massive profitability of its financial, industrial, and service-sector subsidiaries. State Grid has also historically used international investment to help build economies of scale it could apply in its home market; for example, the company’s strong international presence enabled it to build ultra-high voltage (UHV) power lines abroad, where pricing systems supported such development. This helped to drive down costs for its in-house UHV technologies, which it later employed in domestic projects once costs were sufficiently manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, on the political front, State Grid’s successful overseas investments have allowed it to portray itself as a world-class investor, grid operator, and international standard-setter. This reputation — particularly as Beijing promotes the “Going Out” strategy to encourage outbound investment and Chinese-led standard setting — has helped to significantly strengthen State Grid’s domestic bargaining position, both with other companies and with the central government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the government’s vantage point, State Grid remains — despite its outsized independent power — a highly valuable asset in promoting the state’s strategic interests. Most notable among these strategic interests is State Grid’s ability — and aligned goals — to promote international grid interconnections with Chinese firms and technologies, playing a central role in their construction and operation. Promoting Chinese involvement in global grid infrastructure directly aligns with Xi Jinping’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), as well as Beijing’s “Going Out” strategy — and aligns just as well with State Grid’s commercial aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-international-electricity-strategy&quot;&gt;China’s International Electricity Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, China’s grid development vision is largely encapsulated in Xi’s Global Energy Interconnection (GEI) initiative (全球能源互联网), first introduced to the United Nations in 2015. The GEI initiative aims to promote interconnection of the world’s power grids in multiple continents and to invest in clean energy supplies and energy efficiency. State Grid is closely connected to this initiative: from the GEI initiative, the Global Energy Interconnection Development and Cooperation Organization (GEIDCO) was born — an organization that partners with the United Nations and other companies to promote the GEI initiative. State Grid itself is a lead sponsor of GEIDCO, and the organization’s chairman is former State Grid CEO Liu Zhenya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting electric grids creates operational advantages and serves as an avenue for political power projection. A cross-border transmission line between different national or regional grids — an interconnector — can enhance electricity reliability and support a greener grid. In the continental United States, for example, many energy analysts advocate for interconnecting the three different grid regions across the country (currently, the western states, eastern states, and Texas are disconnected from each other). Though hardly a mainstream political issue, calls for grid interconnection are being amplified by the increased prevalence of extreme climate events; risks of severe blackouts, such as the February 2021 outages following winter storm Uri in Texas, can be mitigated by more robust grid interconnections, which provide backup sources of power generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the interconnector debate is focused on increasing international interconnections as a key route to achieving energy and climate goals, and the European Union has set a target of 15 percent grid interconnection by 2030. Larger grids mitigate issues for intermittent renewables like wind and solar; if the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing in one part of the grid, other power sources can compensate. Given that electricity, unlike oil or gas, can travel through interconnectors almost instantaneously, larger grid connections provide more flexibility in dealing with supply issues and can create more efficiency in power distribution. Politically, connecting grid communities across nations can also build cross-border solidarity and help promote social and economic benefits. One of the key interconnectors discussed in this report seeks to connect Cyprus to the EU grid, promoting both integration with other EU countries and reliability of power on the island nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, interconnecting grids also involves technical and political risks. International and interregional transmission lines, if damaged, can cause far-reaching disruptions. Related critical infrastructure, such as healthcare and telecommunications, can be brought down, giving significant political leverage to countries that have ownership over interconnectors. Given the critical role of power grids, integration in international grid projects is an avenue for a country like China to both expand economic ties and increase the strength of its position in dealing with other states. Along with Beijing’s promotion of international electricity infrastructure projects, China is also playing a central role in setting global electricity standards and has become the manufacturing base for key components in large-scale electricity transmission systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2022, State Grid holds stakes in companies in Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Oman, the Philippines, Australia, Singapore, Chile, Brazil, and Greece, and has invested in projects in nearly 40 countries (see Figure 1). State Grid has also expanded to include 20 representative and subsidiary overseas offices, including State Grid Europe, Ltd., the vehicle for the company’s engagement with Greece. The dual corporate and government strategy of promoting grid integration and interconnection, evident in State Grid’s efforts to expand around the globe, provides the backdrop for the company’s pursuit of engagement in the Greek electricity sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The background of State Grid’s size, China’s international electricity strategy, and a baseline of deepening Sino-Greek ties is important context for viewing State Grid’s engagement in Greece. Even before the company gained a stake in Greece’s grid operator, a CCP Inc. ecosystem of Chinese actors was already deepening bilateral relations and promoting global energy interconnection, including COSCO, GEIDCO, and Chinese officials. State Grid’s remarkable size and influence within the Chinese political system later made the company a central player in the CCP Inc. ecosystem’s engagement with Greece’s energy sector, starting with its investment in ADMIE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;state-grids-interests-in-greeces-power-sector&quot;&gt;State Grid’s Interests in Greece’s Power Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the power sector, a combination of Greece’s willingness to welcome Chinese shareholders and its position at the center of emerging European and Euro-Asian grid interconnectors provided more than ample reason for State Grid to explore potential investment opportunities. This exploration was given clear motive by the fact that State Grid’s profits in mainland China are tightly bound by regulations aiming to minimize electricity cost pass-throughs to end users, while profits in liberalized European markets would be sizable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Greek islands also offer favorable environments for renewable energy generation through both solar and wind power, two industries in which private Chinese companies have significant advantages and interests in expanding overseas. The fact that the power grid for these islands is connected to themainland and the rest of Europe means that Chinese renewable energy investments will contribute to the European Union’s green goals, making it unlikely that they would become stranded assets once built — unlike investments in, say, coal plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece, like Portugal and Italy before it, was politically receptive to State Grid’s investment during a time of financial need. However, not all European countries were as willing to offer Chinese SOEs such direct inroads to enter their power grids. In Germany, for example, State Grid attempted to buy a 20 percent stake in regional transmission system operator 50Hertz in 2018, which elicited a rare intervention by the German government to prevent the sale due to concerns over Chinese control of key technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2016, State Grid beat out European competitors to purchase a minority stake in ADMIE, the Greek electric grid operator. State Grid secured a 24 percent stake in ADMIE and installed its own management team in the company, giving the SOE its first major foothold in Greece. ADMIE, in turn, soon gained access to needed financing through new deals with Chinese policy banks. State Grid has since attempted to further expand its role in the Greek electric grid — not under direct state guidance, but by and large for its own commercial interests, which it justifies at home by demonstrating alignment with broader state economic goals. However, State Grid later faced pushback in Greece over concerns about conflicts of interest and the company’s close ties to the Chinese government, underlining how scale and CCP Inc. connections can also constrain international expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;state-grids-entrance-to-greece-via-admie&quot;&gt;State Grid’s Entrance to Greece via ADMIE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Grid’s investment in ADMIE was enabled both by its own vast resources and by its existing footprint in Europe. In October 2017, State Grid finalized its takeover of a minority stake in ADMIE for €320 million ($361.6 million). That sum, then the second-largest Chinese investment in Greece, reflected State Grid’s deep pockets and willingness to spend large sums on international projects. In a previous tender or a 66 percent stake in ADMIE — before Greek authorities lowered the stake offered to 24 percent — Greek media reported that State Grid was willing to pay well over €600 million ($796.8 million), while itsmain European competitor, Terna, could only bid around €300 million ($398.4 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competing with State Grid for stakes in ADMIE was not the first time that Terna had encountered the Chinese SOE. State Grid’s bid in ADMIE came shortly after obtaining 25 percent of REN, a Portuguese grid operator, and 35 percent of CDP Reti, an Italian holding company with shares in two Italian energy companies, Snam and Terna. Greece was the next step in State Grid’s objective to build out a Mediterranean power network — and State Grid’s existing footprint in Europe also directly impacted its bid for a stake in ADMIE; the Chinese SOE only qualified for the bid in the first place because of its existing stake in European companies, a prerequisite for bidding, according to EU rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Grid’s investment in ADMIE reflected both the strengths of its regional corporate strategy and its alignment with Chinese state interests. At the time, its other investments in Europe opened doors for State Grid by allowing it to qualify for the ADMIE bid. Broader Chinese interests also helped secure the agreement. Ahead of the ADMIE investment, Greek newspapers reported that during one of Greek prime minister Alexis Tspiras’s visits to China, Chinese contacts had expressed interest in working with Greece to develop its renewable energy and to invest in Greece’s efforts at interconnecting the island’s power to the mainland’s power grid. During the same meeting, these unspecified “Chinese contacts” — unconfirmed but highly likely to have included State Grid representatives — also expressed an interest in acquiring a stake in Public Power Corporation (PPC), the Greek SOE charged with energy distribution and the 100 percent owner of ADMIE before State Grid’s investment.33 On top of this context of broader Chinese engagement, State Grid’s ability to so significantly outbid its rivals would have made it politically and financially all but impossible for ADMIE and the Greek government to turn down State Grid’s tender.&lt;/p&gt;

Note: The arrow marking State Grid’s expression of interest in PPC is based on the assumption that State Grid was the “Chinese contact” discussed in a Greek media report about the matter, which is unconfirmed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being a minority stakeholder, State Grid has been actively involved in ADMIE’s affairs. In addition to gaining seats on the ADMIE board of directors, State Grid has installed its own personnel in several key managerial positions, including a vice CEO and CFO. Through this arrangement, State Grid can participate in the daily operations of ADMIE, especially those pertaining to technology innovation and power grid development. The terms of its original purchase also gave State Grid the right of first offer for ADMIE’s future share offerings, prompting some suspicion by Greek media that State Grid’s minority stake was just a precursor to the company’s fuller control of ADMIE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Grid’s investment in ADMIE was followed by a cascade of Chinese policy banks engaging with ADMIE and the broader Greek energy sector, underlining the connection between SOE deals and access to Chinese state-backed financing. In November 2017, ADMIE and China Development Bank signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the aim of giving “access to new financing lines” as part of the 2017–2019 Greece-China Action Plan. In May 2018, ADMIE signed a €199 million ($235.0 million) loan contract with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Bank of China, offering unspecified financing for ADMIE over a five-year period. Manousos Manousakis, chairman and CEO of ADMIE, described the 2018 loan as“a clear example of the benefits resulting from the presence of State Grid Corporation of China as a strategic investor in ADMIE [that] leads to an acceleration of big projects such as the interconnections of the Cyclades islands and Crete.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in 2020, several national Greek banks joined the China Development Bank to issue a €400 million ($456 million) loan to ADMIE. ADMIE highlighted the loan as the first example of cooperation between Greek and Chinese financial institutions in the Greek market. Along with State Grid’s willingness to offer a higher tender for a stake in ADMIE compared to European competitors, the succession of ADMIE deals with Chinese banks represents a benefit of accepting State Grid’s bid to become a shareholder. Without access to inside information, it is often impossible to verify whether access to policy bank financing is explicitly promised or offered in major deals with Chinese companies. Whether or not access to policy bank financing was part of the State Grid-ADMIE deal, ADMIE’s subsequent access to financing is a latent advantage of dealing with companies in the CCP Inc. ecosystem. International companies and governments, observing a pattern of business deals being followed by increased access to Chinese banks, may well bake in expectations of future access to financing when choosing their preferred partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stage of State Grid’s involvement in Greece — namely, its successful acquisition of a stake in ADMIE — demonstrates multiple key benefits of the CCP Inc. ecosystem. First, State Grid built its market entry on a foundation of deepening bilateral ties and the flagship COSCO investment in Piraeus, expanding its corporate footprint in line with the broader trend of deepening Sino-Greek economic relations. Second, State Grid’s massive — and directly state-enabled — scale allowed the company to open further doors with existing European connections (via investments in Portugal and Italy), while its massive capital pool — which would be inconceivable for a company without its degree of domestic government support — enabled it to outbid erstwhile competitors. Finally, the support of other Chinese market players also helped facilitate State Grid’s acquisition. This support included the political connections that gave State Grid a platform to speak with a visiting Greek prime minister and the policy banks that opened financing for ADMIE after its deal with State Grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, State Grid did not achieve all of its goals in Greece. In particular, the company was shut out of cross-Mediterranean interconnector projects and has not succeeded in increasing its shares in ADMIE. However, buoyed by CCP Inc., State Grid succeeded in its core goal of building itself a secure foothold in Greece’s electricity sector — and a foundation from which to pursue further European expansion. Moreover, that success has since fed back into the CCP Inc. ecosystem: following State Grid’s investment in ADMIE, other Chinese companies have also initiated major investments in the Greek energy sector. The next section will examine these other Chinese business developments in Greece’s energy sector, which — while not officially tied to State Grid — demonstrate how CCP Inc. has successfully broadened the scope of China’s energy engagement in Greece to a degree unlikely to have been possible without the network advantages of CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;broader-chinese-investments-in-the-greek-energy-sector&quot;&gt;Broader Chinese Investments in the Greek Energy Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP Inc. ecosystem extends beyond the relations of a single SOE to Chinese banks, policy initiatives, and diplomatic officials; a key element of CCP Inc. is the interconnectivity between Chinese firms, including those that are state-owned, those that are privately owned, and those that have “mixed ownership,” with both private and state capital. In the case of Greece’s energy industry, a number of other Chinese companies have invested in the sector, drawing on some of the same advantages of the CCP Inc. ecosystem evident in State Grid’s dealings with ADMIE. Though these business deals have yet to carry out the promises of initial announcements, the investments still demonstrate how different Chinese companies can benefit from the same CCP Inc. ecosystem, tying state bank financing and diplomatic support to commercial projects. Among the Chinese investments in Greece’s energy sector post-2016, two stand out: China’s first major investments in wind and solar power generation in Greece, which are explored in turn below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken individually, different Chinese investments in electric power generation could be seen as independent investments in a new market, unrelated to State Grid’s role in Greece’s electricity transmission system. Viewing the Greek electricity sector more comprehensively, however, reveals indirect connections between State Grid’s expansion and the energy generation ventures of other Chinese companies. Further, different Chinese business deals can be traced back to the same events in the diplomatic timeline of Sino-Greek engagement. In this context, Chinese companies have become increasingly ingrained in the business of both energy generation and energy transmission in Greece since 2016, even though State Grid has not significantly expanded its own footprint further beyond its 24 percent stake in ADMIE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wind-power-cooperation-with-copelouzos-group&quot;&gt;Wind Power Cooperation with Copelouzos Group&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2017 — the year after State Grid won the tender for a 24 percent stake in ADMIE — the Chinese state-owned coal and power giant Shenhua Group (中国神华) purchased a 75 percent stake in four wind parks under development by the Greek Copelouzos Group (Copelouzos). The purchase came after Shenhua Group and Copelouzos signed an MoU in May 2017 for cooperation on green projects, involving a total investment of just over $3 billion. The MoU was arrived at during Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras’s visit to Beijing in May 2017, and the November purchase was settled as one of a number of deals signed between Chinese and Greek officials, as well as heads of major enterprises, under the 2017–2019 Greece-China Action Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of Shenhua Group’s purchase of the 75 percent stake in Copelouzos wind farms (via its subsidiary, Shenhua Renewables), the group was also planning to purchase further Copelouzos assets — though initial momentum ultimately fell short, similar to the case of State Grid. Shenhua Group had initially planned to join PPC (the state-owned Greek power company from which State Grid purchased its stake in ADMIE) and Copelouzos as a partner in their joint company, PPC Solar Solutions. The partnership of Shenhua Group would have brought a Chinese shareholder into another of PPC’s subsidiaries, alongside State Grid’s role in ADMIE. In September 2017, Shenhua Group signed an MoU with PPC for cooperation in power generation, renewable energy projects, research and development, gas infrastructure, and more. However, media reported in 2020 that PPC Solar Solutions had agreed to terminate its joint venture with Copelouzos. At the time, the venture was still 49 percent owned by PPC and 51 percent owned by Copelouzos, indicating that Shenhua Group had never gained a leadership stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teasing out Shenhua Group’s cooperation with Copelouzos is further complicated by the fact that in November 2017, Shenhua Group merged with the state-owned China Guodian Corporation (中国国电集团) to form a new company: China Energy Investment Corporation (国家能源集团, aka CHN Energy). In 2018, Copelouzos Group again signed a cooperation agreement with CHN Energy, which has taken over the 75 percent stake in four Copelouzos wind farms. Echoing statements around State Grid’s investment in ADMIE, Copelouzos Group president Dimitris Copelouzos stated at the time: “We are confident that this cooperation will act as a catalyst for the completion of major investment and promote the energy industry of Greece, in addition to the development of cooperation between Greek and Chinese companies in many sectors of the economy.” CHN Energy also expressed interest in acquiring lignite coal-fired power plants in Megalopoli in southern Greece and in Meliti in northern Greece; however, the sale ultimately did not go through. Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s unexpected announcement in September 2019 that Greece would transition away from coal by 2028 further tamped down Chinese interest in investing in Greek coal mines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developments of Shenhua Group’s — and then CHN Energy’s — collaboration with the Copelouzos Group provide additional data points in the larger story of Sino-Greek energy cooperation. Viewed as part of the same CCP Inc. ecosystem as State Grid’s investment in ADMIE, the business deals demonstrate a trend of broadening Chinese involvement in the Greek electric grid. However, Shenhua Group and CHN Energy’s cooperation with Copelouzos Group also featured more promises and statements of intent than actual concrete projects — another trend across recent Sino-Greek energy ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-first-greenfield-investment-in-greek-solar-power-the-minos-plant&quot;&gt;China’s First “Greenfield” Investment in Greek Solar Power: The MINOS Plant&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further data points for the trend of expanding engagement in the energy sector can be found in China’s efforts to build solar power facilities in Greece, along with further instances of business agreements that have yet to translate into complete projects. In 2019, on the heels of Shenhua Group’s investment in Greek wind energy, several Chinese companies — including state-owned bank ICBC — undertook the financing, design, and construction of Greece’s first concentrating solar power (CSP) plant, the MINOS 50 MW plant on the island of Crete. The MINOS solar plant marked the first “greenfield” project undertaken by Chinese companies in Greece and was hailed by Chinese media as a model for the integration of finance and industry in China’s international investments. Cosin Solar (可胜技术), one of the Chinese companies contracted for the project, described MINOS as “the first CSP project whose whole life cycle is totally designed, manufactured, constructed, financed, and operated by Chinese companies in the international market.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plant is, in fact, a joint venture between UK-based Nur Energie and Greek oil and energy firm Motor Oil Hellas, with Greek firm Prenecon taking part in construction. However, a consortium of Chinese companies, led by China Energy Engineering Group (中国能建葛洲坝国际集团) and Cosin Solar, were selected as the engineering, procurement, and construction contractors for the project, while ICBC provided project financing. This consortium includes a mix of both state-owned firms (like China Energy Engineering Group) and privately owned firms (like Cosin Solar). In terms of political promotion, the MINOS solar plant was given prime billing, both as a result of the 17+1 China- Eastern Europe cooperation framework and as a model BRI project. In the highest possible sign of diplomatic support, the chairmen of ICBC, China Energy Engineering Group, Nur Energie, and the CEO of Prenecon signed the MINOS agreement in front of Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Mitsotakis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-trend-of-diplomatic-support-for-chinese-projects-in-ccp-inc&quot;&gt;The Trend of Diplomatic Support for Chinese Projects in CCP Inc.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHN Energy’s wind power deals and the MINOS solar project, though yet to be completed, demonstrate several key elements of the CCP Inc. ecosystem. The interplay of financing by state banks, the collaboration between public and private Chinese companies, and the provision of diplomatic support for the project all represent conduits of state support. In particular, the element of diplomatic support for specific industrial projects is prominent in Sino-Greek business relations, as outlined in Figure 3. The strong diplomatic attention to business deals is an important element of the CCP Inc. ecosystem, and often the most visible testament to state support for commercial projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wMdlAAu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to CHN Energy-Copelouzos wind cooperation and the MINOS solar plant, a number of other Chinese companies have engaged in energy sector projects or cooperation agreements, including China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), CMEC subsidiary SUMEC Group, and China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG). Though these deals were not all tied directly to State Grid, they are important data points for understanding successes — and shortfalls — of overall engagement by Chinese companies in the Greek energy sector. The depth and breadth of Chinese companies’ engagement with Greece’s grid has risen significantly over the past decade with aid from the CCP Inc. ecosystem’s combination of state financing, diplomatic advocacy, and connectivity between Chinese companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Chinese investment in the Greek energy sector has also hit numerous stumbling blocks. Shenhua Group’s cooperation with the Copelouzos Group resulted in an important wind energy investment but has yet to live up to promises of broader joint projects, and a number of other deals involving Chinese companies in the Greek energy sector have failed to move forward. State Grid, too, has faced difficulties in expanding its role in Greece beyond its initial investment in ADMIE. These challenges illuminate how the CCP Inc. ecosystem can also generate constraints for the firms within it. The connections between diplomatic support, state financing, and SOEs and private Chinese companies evident in the Greek energy sector may have supported the projects’ development, but they also reinforced perceptions of disparate deals as interconnected and closely tied to the Chinese state. The third chapter of this report reflects on how these interrelated strengths and liabilities of CCP Inc. have impacted State Grid’s efforts to expand its footprint beyond its initial investment in ADMIE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-strengths-and-constraints-of-soes-in-the-ccp-inc-ecosystem&quot;&gt;The Strengths and Constraints of SOEs in the CCP Inc. Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;examining-soes-as-policymaking-actors-in-ccp-inc&quot;&gt;Examining SOEs as Policymaking Actors in CCP Inc.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Xi Jinping era has seen the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) increase its reach into the private sector, blurring lines between privately owned and state-owned companies; meanwhile, the CCP has also endeavored to tighten its control over SOEs (an effort State Grid continues to resist). On the other side of the equation, efforts by State Grid and other Chinese SOEs to gain footholds in the Greek electric grid underline the leading role that SOEs continue to play in China’s economic statecraft. Notably, China’s SOEs have been growing stronger over time thanks to a decades-long trend of consolidation, which has seen major Chinese SOEs merged into even more massive conglomerates — one such case being the merger of Shenhua Group and the Guodian Corporation, noted in Chapter 2. The result has been that China’s surviving SOEs are increasingly stable and well resourced, with the capability to undertake a range of global infrastructure, energy, and technology projects. Unlike either private multinationals that are beholden to shareholders and quarterly results cycles or foreign SOEs that are focused on national service provision (e.g., Amtrak), China’s SOEs can bring unparalleled scale to international projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Grid’s own involvement in the Greek energy sector reflects both state and commercial interests, shedding valuable insight on the interplay between SOEs and the government in the broader CCP Inc. ecosystem. First, State Grid’s international expansion strongly aligns with the Chinese government’s policy goals — a fact it has used to bolster its own domestic political position. Along with major national initiatives such as the BRI and the “Going Out” strategy, State Grid plays a leading role in carrying out Xi’s GEI initiative. But State Grid is far from merely a vehicle for implementing Beijing’s policies; as noted in Chapter 1, State Grid launched its European strategy in large part to pursue the higher profits offered by international projects. State Grid regularly discusses the profit motives of ensuring “stable income” from international assets in its corporate documents — in addition, of course, to comments on the need to support national foreign policy initiatives like the BRI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its independent strength and ability to push back on certain domestic reform efforts, even State Grid remains subject to important conduits for Chinese state influence. Among the most important is, quite simply, Beijing’s ability to support State Grid’s pursuit of international business — particularly through the likes of diplomatic engagements and state policy bank financing. For such support to materialize, State Grid must play within certain political boundaries and ensure its efforts genuinely support Beijing’s goals. More broadly, Beijing directly incorporates SOEs into its national policy objectives, creating commercial incentives to feed into policymaking in Beijing and try to shape the policy landscape in favorable ways. While much China scholarship has characterized SOEs as politically passive entities under state control, scholars studying the pluralization of political decisionmaking in China advocate for greater attention to, and analysis of, SOEs’ role in policy planning and government decisionmaking. The case of State Grid and other Chinese companies’ entry into the Greek power sector strongly supports the need for more nuanced and detailed understanding of SOE-government feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that point: State Grid has a history of influencing policy debates within China. As outlined in Chapter 1, over the past 20 years, State Grid has expanded its assets contrary to government reform efforts, and over the past decade it has become a major obstacle to government efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Meanwhile, the company has also injected its own interests into policy initiatives. For example, within China in 2000–2009, State Grid promoted UHV technology — at the time untested — to solve the policy issue of power shortages. UHV was a solution that made far more sense from a profit-making perspective than a public policy perspective: namely, State Grid could profit from becoming a standard-setter in a cutting-edge technology, though in practice UHV would serve as a distraction — and take finite financing and resources — from critical demand-side reforms that policymakers rightly saw as the most important solution at hand. State Grid pushed its UHV technology through government meetings, company investments, and company-funded research and feasibility studies, ultimately selling the solution to relevant policymakers at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), and the State Environmental Protection Administration (the predecessor of today’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment). Just as State Grid promoted its own interests into domestic UHV policy, the firm worked to influence foreign policy efforts in favor of its international interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the strong connection between State Grid and the GEI initiative provides a clear picture of the other side of the policy feedback loop connecting commercial and political incentives. In its own company reports, State Grid is explicit in stating that one of its main goals is to serve the CCP’s political and foreign policy agenda, particularly the BRI and the “Going Out” strategy, as well as to help other Chinese firms establish themselves in the international market. State Grid’s close association with the GEI initiative as the force behind GEIDCO also provides a conduit into a more specified policy initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GEI initiative serves China’s industrial policy both commercially, by promoting specific technologies that would benefit Chinese companies, and diplomatically, by offering an avenue for China to promote its climate leadership. While the GEI initiative provides a policy umbrella for State Grid’s international ventures — along with the BRI and the “Going Out” strategy — State Grid, in turn, plays an important role in promoting the initiative and guiding its specific goals. The GEI initiative, in turn, serves Chinese companies’ commercial interests by driving market interest in certain grid technologies, such as UHV transmission lines. As most of the world’s UHV lines are in China and were constructed by Chinese companies, China holds a key competitive advantage over the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its own words, State Grid states that “in implementing the national “going out” development strategy, [State Grid Corporation of China] has clearly defined the strategic goal of “going out” with UHV technology, and has striven to promote the global application of UHV transmission technology, specifications, and standards.” Given this synergy of commercial and policy interests, both the pursuit of business gains and the pursuit of CCP goals can credibly be called driving forces behind State Grid’s overseas investment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Grid’s investment in ADMIE was more than just an individual business deal; it built on years of Chinese efforts to make inroads into the Greek market, starting with COSCO’s investment in the port of Piraeus. The completion of the COSCO deal opened doors for State Grid representatives to meet with Greek officials in bilateral diplomatic events and allowed ADMIE to access Chinese bank financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the headwinds facing State Grid’s role in ADMIE illuminate how the SOE’s involvement in the CCP Inc. ecosystem also served as a constraint. The same connections to diplomatic support, financing, and other Chinese companies that advance Chinese business interests in the CCP Inc. ecosystem also reinforce overseas perceptions that all Chinese companies — even private ones — are tightly connected with each other and, most importantly, with the Chinese government. This, in turn, has at times piqued suspicions that Chinese companies’ business activities are simply extensions of political activities — catalyzing pushback against Chinese market actors and the projects they pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;constraints-in-ccp-inc-state-grids-challenges-in-expanding-its-footprint-in-greece&quot;&gt;Constraints in CCP Inc.: State Grid’s Challenges in Expanding Its Footprint in Greece&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Grid’s acquisition of stakes in ADMIE, and ADMIE’s subsequent access to Chinese bank financing, initially indicated momentum for State Grid’s ambitions to expand its role in Greece’s electric grid. But over the longer term, ADMIE’s relationship with its minority shareholder became more complicated. While State Grid’s initial interest in ADMIE demonstrated a broader vision for investments in grid interconnectors and renewable energy, its ability to execute this vision has run up against Greek pushback to Chinese investments and conflict of interest concerns. Most notably, since 2017, State Grid has sought unsuccessfully to expand its share in ADMIE; been thwarted in efforts to gain additional stakes in ADMIE-related subsidiary companies; and ultimately lodged protests against ADMIE over the tenure of its current CEO. While the CCP Inc. ecosystem helped State Grid enter the Greek power market, it has since constrained its ability to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qqDJlHa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: PPC, ADMIE, and Their Subsidiaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources cited throughout the report. The label for the PPC-HEDNO relationship is from &lt;a href=&quot;https://greekreporter.com/2021/09/11/hedno/&quot;&gt;Philip Chrysopoulos, “Greece Sells 49% of Public Power Corporation HEDNO to Australian Company,” Greek Reporter, September 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Xi’s November 2019 visit to Greece, State Grid directly expressed interest in expanding the company’s stake in ADMIE. In 2020, however, the Covid-19 pandemic stalled talks between Beijing and Athens, and in the two years since, no sale of additional shares has been completed. In January 2021, Greece barred State Grid from participating in the prospective sale of a 49 percent stake in the Greek distribution network operator HEDNO (Greek: DEDDIE), another subsidiary of ADMIE parent company PPC, due to concerns over conflict of interest — concerns driven by the perception that connections between Chinese entities (the other party being undisclosed) were too strong, which prompted State Grid to lodge a formal complaint. In an instance of CCP Inc. connectivity backfiring on Chinese companies, another undisclosed Chinese company was also barred from participating in the HEDNO tender, an episode that European researchers have described as “precedent” for Chinese SOEs being treated as connected rather than separate entities. The perception of interconnection will remain a structural risk for Chinese companies’ investments abroad — particularly where these connections are perceived as posing not only market risks, but also political risks due to connections with, and influence by, the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, State Grid technically remains in contention to gain a stake in the ADMIE subsidiary Ariadne Interconnector, which is responsible for connecting the island of Crete to the grid of mainland Greece. The tender process has dragged on for years, ever since State Grid first expressed interest in the Ariadne Interconnector during Xi’s visit to Greece in November 2019. State Grid’s ability to participate in the Ariadne Interconnector so far is particularly significant due to the project’s links to the broader EuroAsia Interconnector, a planned linkage of Greece to the grids of Cyprus and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Greek media reporting ahead of the State Grid-ADMIE deal, an important aspect of State Grid’s interest in ADMIE ties to Greece’s planned position in new electric interconnector lines that would link international electric grids. The European Union has long worked toward improving cross-border electricity connection for a more secure, reliable, and sustainable electricity supply, and Greece itself has plans to connect the power grids across its islands. In 2017, State Grid had expressed its support for the EuroAsia Interconnector, a major electricity interconnector between Israel, Cyprus, Greece, and Europe — labeled an “electricity highway” — connecting the three countries’ grids. The project is aimed at remedying the isolation of Cyprus’s grid from the rest of the European Union, bolstering energy security for all three nations and as well as Europe’s ability to support a green grid, as discussed in Chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pxG6jyC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Proposed Route of the EuroAsia Interconnector.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://euroasia-interconnector.com/&quot;&gt;EuroAsia Interconnector homepage&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ariadne-interconnection.gr/en#exelixi&quot;&gt;Ariadne Interconnection homepage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, State Grid’s interest in the EuroAsia Interconnector has not still translated into a significant role in the project. In 2018, the section of the interconnector that ADMIE was involved in was ultimately spun off into a national project, the Ariadne Interconnector. The Ariadne Interconnector will connect the large island of Crete to mainland Greece and Europe in order to avert electricity shortages on Crete and take advantage of Crete’s favorable environment for renewable power sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though State Grid expressed interest as far back as 2019 in acquiring up to 20 percent of shares in Ariadne (a 100 percent subsidiary of ADMIE), at the time of this report‘s publication, the deal has yet to go through. In June 2022, the European Commission and the Greek Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) approved the tender for the sale of a stake in Ariadne, after years of delays because State Grid’s involvement with ADMIE required Greece’s energy regulator to turn to the European Commission for a green light. Some media reports on the matter have described concerns from the European Commission about further Chinese involvement in strategic assets, but the full details behind the delays have not been publicly explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another instance of tension between State Grid and ADMIE, in February 2022, the tenure of the current president and managing director of ADMIE, Manousos Manousakis, was renewed, despite protests by State Grid. According to Greek media reports, State Grid’s complaints stem from displeasure with its lack of participation in Ariadne’s contractor agreements and the technical side of the project. The issue was even reportedly the subject of discussion during an April 2022 meeting between Chinese ambassador Xiao Juncheng and Greece’s minister of energy, Kostas Skekras. The Ariadne Interconnector is the largest electricity project that Greece has taken on; these reports suggest State Grid is dissatisfied with its small role in the project. However, given that media reports cite EU concerns about China’s control over Greece’s electric grid as one reason that Ariadne was spun off from the EuroAsia Interconnector in the first place, State Grid’s efforts to increase its control over the project could well prove counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reflection on CCP Inc. in Greece’s energy sector suggests that the source of the ecosystem’s strengths — namely, its interconnectedness — is also the source of considerable long-term risks and potential liabilities for its constituent enterprises. State Grid’s ties to the Chinese state and its prominent role within the CCP Inc. ecosystem make it subject to suspicions directed at the Chinese state capitalist apparatus more broadly. Wherever international perceptions of and policies toward the Chinese state continue to sour, it will become increasingly difficult for Chinese companies to balance the strengths and liabilities of their involvement in the CCP Inc. ecosystem — in which, at this stage, they have little choice but to be perceived as participating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of Chinese companies’ involvement in the Greek energy sector underscores both the strengths and limitations of the CCP Inc. system. The case of Chinese investment into Greece’s energy sector, as well as COSCO’s preceding investments in Piraeus, shows how the CCP Inc. ecosystem has both supported and hindered the foreign business ventures of private, hybrid, and state-controlled Chinese companies. The specific case of State Grid provides insight into a critical type of actor in the CCP Inc. ecosystem: namely, a major SOE that both implements and informs policy, and thereby a key player in Chinese state capitalism’s ability to exercise global reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the greatest strengths of CCP Inc. is the capacity for state support to overcome geopolitical barriers that private firms would be hard-pressed to hurdle alone. From former prime minister Alexis Tpiras’s meetings with State Grid officials during visits to Beijing, to Xi Jinping’s flagship 2019 Greece visit, diplomatic support for Chinese commercial projects in Greece has been strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great strength of CCP Inc. is its capacity to leverage public funding for ventures that might struggle using private funding alone — and, at times, to open public funding opportunities that simply would not otherwise exist. For example, ADMIE’s ability to access Chinese policy bank financing in the wake of State Grid’s investment underlined the interplay between Chinese state financiers and enterprises. This advantage is also not mutually exclusive with other advantages, such as diplomatic support: as explored in Chapter 2, many Chinese companies — both state-owned and private — simultaneously benefited from diplomatic support, bank financing, and their connections with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for State Grid itself, the company’s original capacity to win a stake in ADMIE was enabled by both its existing footprint in Europe and its deep pockets, bolstered by access to cheap government policy bank funding. As a massive and complex SOE, State Grid can both draw on the support of the Chinese state and simultaneously lobby to embed its own commercial interests in official policy. The company’s own corporate strategy underlines that it is an enterprise with global ambitions and — with the backing of CCP Inc. — the state-empowered scale to pursue them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the case of the Greek energy sector also reveals constraints on State Grid and other CCP Inc. actors. Misgivings about Chinese control over critical electricity infrastructure ultimately limited State Grid’s ability to embed itself in critical international electricity interconnectors. In other words, the very same strong state support that helped propel State Grid’s initial investment in ADMIE, as well as the many other Chinese investments in the Greek energy sector, became a liability by making commercial Chinese actors difficult to distinguish, politically, from the Chinese state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key mission of the CCP Inc. project is to examine how the United States and market economy allies can effectively respond to new challenges posed by China’s evolving state capitalist system. The case of Greece — a market economy with a democratic system — provides insight into how concerns over the risks of CCP Inc. can limit its reach. European misgivings about China’s role in critical electricity infrastructure appear to have played a key role in preventing State Grid from expanding its stake in ADMIE and gaining involvement in the EuroAsia Interconnector, though neither Greek officials nor corporate documents state it so directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Greece’s energy sector was able to genuinely benefit from Chinese investments in renewable energy at a time of national financial difficulty. China’s leading position in renewable energy technologies puts it in a position to play a key role in proliferating much-needed clean energy infrastructure. As countries around the world pursue a transition to clean energy, both the CCP Inc. ecosystem and the comparative advantages of Chinese firms in various clean energy technologies put China in a highly competitive market position. Understanding how actors within the CCP Inc. ecosystem interact and play off of — and into — Chinese government policy will be critical for countries that turn to China for the technology and infrastructure necessary for the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

A series of recent polls suggests that the war has actually increased the Ukrainian people’s trust in their local and national government and largely want the international community to empower them and their government to rebuild their shattered country rather than to do it for them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine confronted the Russian invasion on an already-weak footing. Economic challenges exacerbated by COVID held Ukrainians’ attention more than the Russian occupation of Crimea and Donbas or even the threat of Russian invasion in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/July%202021%20_bi-annual%20survey%20-%20public.pdf&quot;&gt;a July-August 2021 National Democratic Institute poll&lt;/a&gt;. Respondents had somewhat more trust in local government than in national government and its agencies, but little confidence in any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A September 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/ukraine-resilience-monitor&quot;&gt;Ipsos survey shows&lt;/a&gt; some of the ways in which Ukrainians have suffered from the invasion. Unemployment has risen across the country and especially in frontline cities. Ukrainians who have not been displaced have suffered significant income loss. Residents of cities at or near the frontlines suffer from serious degradation of essential services, including access to safe drinking water, hot water, and heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/N774fre.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Employment has plummeted in frontline cities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IWacJBO.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;▲ Frontline cities have experienced the sharpest job loss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Ukraine has shown remarkable resilience in the face of a Russian attack that has deliberately targeted economic and infrastructure facilities throughout the country and not only near the front lines. The Ipsos poll shows that the majority of employed Ukrainians in major unoccupied cities surveyed are still receiving their salaries on time and, for those that are delayed, the delays are usually less than two weeks. These data suggest that Ukrainians have managed to maintain a largely functional economic and financial system despite their pre-war challenges and the ravages of a brutal invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gZOFSx6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Ukrainians who stayed in frontline cities either don’t have any income or have experienced significant income loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SOgpefN.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Most of Mykolaiv’s residence don’t have access to safe drinking water.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has also managed to avoid nationalizing or seriously unbalancing its economy even as it has mobilized for war. Nearly 65% of employed respondents work in private enterprises, with 48% either self-employed or employed at small or medium-sized businesses. The survey naturally does not capture the proportion of Ukrainians currently serving with the armed forces, but the results clearly show that a private economy providing normal services continues to operate despite the horror of war and the rigors of mobilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainians are also finding ways to keep essential services functional in key frontline cities despite constant Russian attacks. Over 99% of respondents had access to electricity, including 100% in Kharkiv. Fewer than 7% had lost access to gas. Over 90% had internet access and over 98% had mobile phone service. Over 80% of residents of Lviv, Kyiv, Dnipro, and Kharkiv reported that they had access to safe drinking water, although only 26% of Mykolayiv inhabitants said the same. The figure for Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, is remarkable. Russian forces remained within artillery range of Kharkiv until September and have constantly attacked it with artillery shells, multiple-launch rocket systems, and long-range precision munitions since February. Russian attacks regularly damage key infrastructure nodes especially in frontline cities, but Ukrainians are managing to repair and keep their systems operating remarkably well despite these attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Vi0H9Vx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Whether they are on the frontlines or in the rear cities, most people are getting their salaries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bYGVXAk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;If people do experience a delay in their salary, it mostly comes within a week or two.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important and promising fact emerging from this survey is that Ukrainians are doing this. The international aid and donor communities are providing aid now and studying Ukraine’s needs in preparation to help with post-war reconstruction but have not taken over operation or repair of major infrastructure. Ukrainians are doing that for the most part by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainians expect to keep doing it themselves, moreover, empowered by the international community but not replaced by it. Asked whether their own local or national government, their own civil society, or international organizations should be responsible for reconstruction large majorities preferred Ukrainian local or national government. That finding is remarkable considering the apparently waning trust in governmental institutions that had characterized pre-war Ukraine. It suggests that Ukrainians want to rebuild a self-sufficient functioning state and do not want to become wards of the international community. It suggests that they want to believe that their government can serve them despite its present and historical challenges and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s challenges remain immense and must be confronted with clear eyes and no illusions. The indications that Ukrainians want their government to work do not mean that it can or will, or even that they think it will. Unemployment remains far too high, and Ukraine will require large infusions of cash and reconstruction aid in the coming months and years to rebuild what the Russians have destroyed. Success is by no means guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is reason for hope in a very dark time. Ukrainians have fought the Russian army and are driving it back with Western weapons and cash, but no Western soldiers. They are keeping their economy alive with Western money but their own expertise and ingenuity. Ukraine has shown in this terrible trial by fire its determination to make itself free and functional. That is an effort worth investing in.&lt;/p&gt;

The resulting range of scenarios point toward an urgent need to develop new escalation management frameworks supporting the new integrated deterrence strategy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-the-future---&quot;&gt;In the future . . .&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There will be a new escalation ladder more oriented to air, maritime, cyber, and space dynamics than the Cold War confrontations. Beijing will seek alternatives to full-scale invasion to compel Taiwan that involve a calibrated mix of threats and limited military operations to pressure the island and deter foreign involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An isolated China will not necessarily be a more peaceful China. Even if Taiwan and its international partners can avoid a major war, the result will likely be major economic dislocation as well as new escalation risks and policy dilemmas associated with supporting Taipei without triggering a regional conflict. Businesses and governments will hedge against losses, creating sustained price pressures and a decoupling of Western firms from the Chinese market. Understanding these risks requires an entirely new type of crisis simulation integrated with multitrack diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military pressure absent dialogue could prove to be a recipe for disaster. The United States can help the world avoid a major war in Taiwan by highlighting different escalation risks and working with a broad coalition of actors — including the private sector and Chinese government — to explore different scenarios and create a new escalation management framework.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat of war in East Asia has reached a fever pitch. The August 2022 visit by U.S. speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and two separate congressional delegations in May and August 2022 capped a year that has seen an increase in large, complex Chinese military exercises. These exercises continue to demonstrate China’s ability to isolate Taiwan and set the conditions for larger military operations. The use of military force to signal adversaries is consistent with Chinese writings on war control, strategic deterrence, and creating a war atmosphere as part of crisis bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-scale exercises are not a precursor to war but an effort to coerce while setting conditions for future response options. In fact, Chinese writing on strategic deterrence states that “through exercises, we can demonstrate our military’s combat capabilities to the opponent, but also cause the opponent to doubt our intentions, cause psychological panic and produce a deterrent effect.” At a higher escalation level, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) calls for “restrictive military operations” that use “forcible control measures in a certain area to squeeze the opponent’s operating space and restrict opponents’ movement” through the use of exclusion areas and exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This edition of the On Future War series uses historical case studies of militarized crises to extrapolate alternative future scenarios concerning Taiwan. The scenarios illustrate a menu of coercive options short of a major war that China could employ over the next 10 years. Each possible future in turn maps the escalation dynamics and dilemmas national security leaders in Beijing, Taipei, Washington, and corporate boardrooms may confront.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Because no one can see the future, we invite readers to a broader dialogue about the prospects for future crises in the Taiwan Strait. Each scenario allows readers to anonymously respond via a short survey. Tell us about the inherent escalation risks, the probability of the crisis scenario, or alternatives you see on the horizon. Based on the results, the On Future War team at CSIS will develop a wargame and invite respondents to participate.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen in this light, China is not planning an immediate invasion of Taiwan. Rather, the PLA is refining its ability to coerce and compel Taipei’s political leadership while testing international resolve, a strategy consistent with what Thomas Schelling called the diplomacy of violence. Chinese strategy writing even calls for “leading a crisis” and “taking advantage of seizing the opportunities and conditions created by the crisis situation, making the best of the situation, taking advantage of the situation, and solving problems that are difficult to solve and break through under normal circumstances.” U.S., allied, and partner strategy in East Asia should therefore expand from a narrow focus on war planning to developing flexible response options to counter the wider menu of coercive options Beijing could opt for after the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, scheduled for October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus on the worst-case scenario (i.e., the most dangerous course of action) is both an organizational reflex built into planning processes and a mechanism to analyze force modernization. The U.S. national security community has increasingly opted to use a Taiwan scenario to test new concepts and prioritize capability investments. These scenarios tend to assume a large-scale conventional invasion, usually short of nuclear use. For example, in October 2021, the Joint Staff tested the new joint warfighting concept against a Taiwan scenario, finding that the United States struggled to establish information dominance and that traditional approaches to receipt, staging, and onward integration made air and naval forces deploying into theater vulnerable to attack. In 2020 and 2021, U.S. Air Force capability integration games showed that autonomous drone swarms and fielding a distributed targeting system, similar to how Uber uses GPS technology to locate and assign drivers to customers, were key to denying PLA objectives. These findings are consistent with the mosaic warfare concept and show a national security community actively experimenting and using wargames not just to educate but to explore competing hypotheses about the future of warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most games focus on large-scale military operations associated with an amphibious assault of Taiwan, there is a growing effort to look at alternatives. In a 2021 wargame, the Center for a New American Security explored response options in the event China conducted a fait accompli and seized outlying Taiwanese islands (e.g., Pratas and Dongsha) in the South China Sea. Separately, through a series of tabletop exercises focused on Taiwan in early 2022, CSIS explored gray zone options and how they created new escalation risks. Contrary to large-scale invasion games, these efforts explore what Schelling referred to as “salami tactics.” In other studies on gray zone campaigns, this approach is referred to as a gradualist campaign that sacrifices a decisive outcome and escalation risks for a series of interrelated, smaller activities designed to compel the target state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This installment of On Future War continues this exploration of alternatives to a large-scale invasion and considers the rungs of the escalation ladder China could ascend to compel Taiwan into submission short of a major, protracted war and occupying the island. The study looks back to look ahead and uses historical cases to imagine alternative futures. No single scenario is predictive, but examining many scenarios illustrates tendency and potential. Seeing a range of futures supports strategy, military planning, and operational design as defense officials refine concepts, capabilities, and budgets in an increasingly uncertain and risk-prone security environment. The sections below offer six historical cases that illustrate a coercive option short of full-scale invasion. Each case is consistent with a demonstration scenario design pioneered by Herman Kahn. In each alternative future, the authors extrapolate and describe what a future crisis would look like if Beijing adopted an approach similar to the historical episode. From this vantage point, the research team considers how likely the alternative future is as well as the consequences, key indicators, and critical decisions almost certain to confront leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using historical cases to create a range of alternative future scenarios complements ongoing CSIS efforts to reimagine strategic analysis by combining gaming, foresight, red teaming, and best practices from social science, including empirical and experimental approaches. The security problems on the horizon in the twenty-first century cannot be solved by the thinking that produced them nor outdated methods that focus more on admiring problems than exploring and testing alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-scenario-one-political-warfare&quot;&gt;Alternative Scenario One: Political Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aligned with China’s “Three Warfares” concept, Beijing could conduct a political warfare campaign against Taiwan optimized for the Information Age similar to U.S. covert action during the 1948 Italian election. The purpose would be to disrupt Taiwan’s democratic system of governance and shape Taiwan public opinion to support the gradual reintegration of Taiwan into China. The principal method would be the use of psychological warfare, public opinion warfare, and legal warfare to weaken public confidence in Taiwan’s government as well as key international partners (i.e., the United States and Japan) and coerce Taiwan into adopting a pro-Beijing political stance. The desired condition would be to persuade the Taiwanese public to either support Beijing or dimmish their confidence in their democracy, allowing China to use other forms of national power to reintegrate Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;us-political-warfare-in-italian-elections-1948&quot;&gt;U.S. Political Warfare in Italian Elections (1948)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1940s, the United States used overt and covert psychological warfare, economic measures, and political alliances to influence the 1948 Italian parliamentary general election. The technique, defined by George Kennan as “political warfare,” saw the United States leverage a combination of economic, political, and informational initiatives to influence the Italian public to prevent a communist party victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, U.S. operatives sponsored anti-communist movements and political parties to ensure they gained influence over Italian society and won a majority of votes during the 1948 election. The U.S. government supported the political victory of anti-communist politicians by covertly funding the campaign costs of two non-communist parties — the Christian Democracy Party and the Italian Socialist Workers Party. In addition, the United States also covertly financed non-communist labor movements to weaken pro-communist ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, U.S. operatives delegitimized the Italian Communist Party (PCI) by influencing the Italian public through “white” and “black” propaganda campaigns. White propaganda, or overt psychological warfare efforts, included positive messaging of U.S. aid programs to the Italian public, the use of American media to promote anti-communist messaging (e.g., Voice of America and radio broadcasts involving celebrities), and diplomatic messaging from the U.S. embassy. Black propaganda, or covert psychological warfare efforts, aimed to secretly discredit the PCI and involved the United States enabling local actors, such as Luigi Gedda’s Civic Committees, to create and spread anti-communist messaging. Later codified in a 1951 psychological warfare campaign plan, these efforts focused on destroying the respectability of the PCI, compromising communists in public office, discrediting communist resistance efforts in World War II, and publicizing scandals of communist party leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These combined lines of effort helped the Christian Democracy Party gain 48.5 percent of the vote in the election and led to a worse than expected showing by the PCI. To capitalize on this success, the United States expanded its psychological warfare operations and funded anti-communist organizations. It also worked through the Italian government to implement a campaign of legislative and administrative harassment (i.e., legal warfare) designed to discriminate against communist individuals and groups and promote divisions within the PCI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-a-chinese-political-warfare-campaign-look-like&quot;&gt;What Would a Chinese “Political Warfare” Campaign Look Like?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 20XX. Following the rise of tensions after the fourth Taiwan Strait crisis, senior Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials covertly sanction a campaign to undermine the upcoming Taiwan presidential and legislative elections and influence the Taiwanese people to support reintegration by 2049. This consists of two strategic initiatives: black propaganda and public opinion warfare. With only months before the election, political divisions within Taiwan over the issue of statehood have reached a boiling point, with protests turning into violent confrontations in Taipei. Following the latest protest, involving over 100,000 people, a U.S. cybersecurity company releases a report stating that it has identified over 300,000 inauthentic Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok posts that specifically targeted Taiwan. The company concludes that PLA Unit 61716 had engaged in a multiyear black propaganda campaign to discredit political parties and politicians who support Taiwan’s statehood. This campaign is seen as the origin of political tensions prior to the election. Following this report, international media outlets are reporting on a massive leak of classified U.S. documents following a cyberattack against the U.S. Department of Defense. Among the largely falsified documents appear to be classified briefings between bipartisan members of the executive and legislative branches stating that the United States has no intention of supporting Taiwan in armed conflict with China and will use Taiwan as a “bargaining chip” to prevent a regional war. Although only a small fraction of the documents are deemed to be authentic, the claim that the United States would abandon Taiwan is immediately disputed by the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months prior to the election, the U.S. intelligence community declassifies an intelligence finding outlining how the CCP has covertly sent campaign donations through third-party donors to political parties who support unification. This includes nonprofit organizations and think tanks to recruit respected regional and Taiwanese political and military leaders to publicly promote or privately lobby for Taiwan’s reintegration with China under the “one country, two systems” approach. The finding also states that Beijing secretly used bribery and compromising information to influence key business leaders, politicians, and academics to promote a pro-Beijing agenda during the campaign season. Multiple high-profile, pro-independence members of Taiwan’s political elite are caught up in scandals, many of which include the use of deepfakes and overt blackmail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the CCP’s campaign is successful. Pro-independence officials fail to increase their hold on the government, and the entire rhetoric about independence appears to be shifting. In a show of support for a “new harmonious path,” the newly elected Taiwanese president flies to Beijing in an unprecedented meeting with President Xi Jinping to discuss formally extending the “one country, two systems” governance model to Taiwan over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the success of Chinese propaganda and coercive efforts in the past and existence of formal organizations to conduct political warfare, the “Three Warfares” campaign is very likely and need not be executed as a standalone effort. If this scenario were to occur, key indicators would include increases in white or black propaganda in cyberspace, licit or illicit Chinese funding of political parties, coercion of key Taiwan and regional leaders, and China-sponsored lobbying organizations. The consequences would be long-term political divisions within Taiwan, erosion of Taiwan’s democratic system, and strained relations with the United States and regional allies. U.S. and allied policymakers will face a decision about whether they should employ a political warfare campaign to counter malign CCP influence or use more overt, defensive efforts designed to counter misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation (MDM). The open question would be whether or not Taiwan and its network of democratic partners could sufficiently counter MDM before it starts to affect public opinion. In addition to the efficacy of MDM programs, there is a larger question about generational change and attitudes toward social media. Even if Beijing’s political warfare campaign successfully captures the airwaves and cyberspace, the Taiwanese public still might opt to reject all official media as well as trolls disseminating MDM. Rather than winning hearts and minds or creating space for a political solution favorable to Beijing, a political warfare campaign could also produce widespread apathy and distrust of all official parties and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-scenario-two-nuclear-blackmail&quot;&gt;Alternative Scenario Two: Nuclear Blackmail&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a dramatic shift of its nuclear policy, China could conduct a nuclear weapons test during a fabricated crisis, just as the Soviet Union did during the 1961 Note Crisis. The purpose would be to signal the risks of external intervention while communicating the potential costs to Taiwan of non-compliance with China’s demands. The principal method would be nuclear blackmail combined with political warfare. China’s information warfare and cyber operations would disrupt network traffic while circulating themes and messages suggesting the West was pulling Taiwan into a dangerous crisis and risking war. In addition, China would use a nuclear weapons test to create a war atmosphere without committing large-scale military force. The desired outcome for Beijing would be an alteration of the political calculus of Taiwan’s political parties, pushing both the Democratic Progressive Party and Kuomintang away from openly discussing diplomatic and military engagement with foreign states. In other words, the coercive campaign would seek to stifle Taiwan’s democratic progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-note-crisis-1961&quot;&gt;The Note Crisis (1961)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The historical parallel for this scenario is the 1961 Note Crisis, when the Soviet Union combined diplomatic threats with a large-scale nuclear test to coerce Finnish political leaders to ensure the country remained diplomatically isolated and neutral. On October 30, 1961, the Soviets broke a moratorium on atmospheric nuclear testing and demonstrated the capabilities of the Tsar Bomb in the most powerful nuclear test in history. Moscow simultaneously sent a note to Finland requesting that it consult with the Soviet Union on the defense of both countries given the threat from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as provided for in the Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948. Finland feared the Soviet Union would use the crisis to justify its annexation. However, cooperating with the Soviet Union would fracture Finland’s policy of neutrality and severely damage its relationship with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coercive campaign changed the political calculus for Finland domestically and internationally. In the weeks following the arrival of the note, Finnish president Urho Kekkonen attempted to appease both sides. On November 20, Kekkonen received a letter from President John F. Kennedy that reinforced the United States’ desire for Finland to remain neutral. In response, Kekkonen reassured the United States that he did not want to discuss military cooperation with the Soviets. Four days later, Kekkonen traveled to Serbia for a day-long discussion with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, who decided to “postpone” the military discussions. With tensions diffused, Kekkonen returned home to Helsinki a hero, and his success in defusing the Note Crisis won him re-election in 1962 over an anti-Soviet opponent. Although Kekkonen preserved Finland’s interests, his victory, attributed to his role in the Note Crisis, ultimately served Soviet interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-nuclear-blackmail-look-like&quot;&gt;What Would Nuclear Blackmail Look Like?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 20XX. Approaches to cross-strait relations continue to divide Taiwanese political parties, with both sides proposing a different approach to managing Beijing and integrating with the West. Prior to Taiwan’s presidential election, Beijing sends Taipei a secret note outlining a “one country, two systems” compromise (similar to Hong Kong and Macau) as the only option preventing Taiwan from destruction in a larger regional war with the United States. In the note, Beijing argues that a close relationship between the United States and Taiwan would pose a tremendous threat to mainland China, making their joint security paramount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time that Taiwan receives the secret note, news headlines around the world show unprecedented pictures of a Chinese atmospheric nuclear weapons test. Hours later, Xi Jinping announces that the nuclear test conducted was a necessary response to pro-independence talks in Taiwan as well as corruption of the region by the West and the “unhinged” U.S. administration. Xi states that he will take further action to protect the region from the control of “dangerous Western forces, from both inside and out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching from across the Pacific, the U.S. response is swift. The U.S. Armed Forces are put on DEFCON 3, and the president gives a nationally televised speech condemning the escalation and promising intervention should China act unilaterally against Taiwan or any of its neighbors. Leaders in Japan, Australia, and across Europe echo this sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s political leaders face a Hobson’s choice. Rejecting China’s request outright risks validating Beijing’s claims of Western influence on the island and spurring unilateral action, perhaps even invasion. Accepting the note risks eroding decades of democratic progress. To complicate matters further, rumors of the note are amplified by campaign rhetoric injected into the presidential election by bots likely linked to Chinese cyber operations. Taiwan’s public grows increasingly concerned about becoming a victim of a larger war and, for the first time in years, wants a compromise. Reports leak of a Taiwanese delegation meeting with Chinese leaders in Singapore to defuse the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While more likely than a full-scale conventional invasion, nuclear blackmail is unlikely in the near future. Although China has increased its nuclear arsenal in recent years, conducting an atmospheric nuclear test would represent a serious escalation toward nuclear war unseen in the world since the peak of the Cold War. The more likely outcome from this scenario is the manufacturing of a crisis by Beijing to provide the pretense for escalating its military pressure on Taiwan. Just as the Soviet Union did with Finland during the Note Crisis, it is possible to imagine a scenario in which China argues that an exaggerated threat from the West is disrupting the status quo and corrupting Taiwan with pro-independence sentiment, as well as that the broader protection of the region is in the strategic interest of China. Overall, Taiwan’s relationship with China today is far more contentious and mistrusting than Finland’s was with the Soviet Union in the early 1960s. As such, the ruse that China would be acting in the interest of Taiwan would be far more transparent. Accordingly, the net outcome from such a scenario may in fact be greater frustration among the leadership and public of Taiwan toward China, and therefore a pro-independence shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-scenario-three-quarantine&quot;&gt;Alternative Scenario Three: Quarantine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than incurring the risk of a large-scale invasion, Beijing could opt for a pressure campaign similar to the Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948. The purpose of the operation would be to test Western resolve to defend Taiwan and alter Taiwan’s domestic political calculus. This method would involve a modern blockade, combining a mix of traditional naval measures but also expanded air defense identification areas, electronic interference, fiber-optic cable severing, cyber intrusions, and threats in space. These measures would also include “Three Warfares” activities that would focus on framing the blockade as a quarantine for legal reasons, complicating external intervention. The campaign would include MDM to create domestic divisions inside the external states most likely to support Taipei. The desired condition would be a politically and economically isolated Taiwan that China can absorb over time while setting conditions for future military operations, to include invasion. A blockade is a positional strategy that gives China options to either offramp or escalate a crisis while gaining a key position of military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;berlin-airlift-19481949&quot;&gt;Berlin Airlift (1948–1949)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1948, coordination between the Soviet, British, French, and U.S. occupying forces was breaking down. The Soviet Union maintained large, mechanized formations as part of its occupation of the eastern zone in Germany, while Allied forces had drawn down large numbers of forces. In June 1948, Britain, France, and the United States engaged in a series of political and economic moves the Soviets viewed as subverting their ability to control the future of Germany. In response, the Soviets stopped routine meetings with the Western powers after they discovered a secret plan to create a new German state out of the western occupied zones. They then began high-level preparations to exert military pressure in support of a blockade at a level sufficient to reduce the risk of a counterattack against Moscow. These measures included internal propaganda designed to bolster political and ideological cohesion among Soviet forces against former allies, which subsequent interviews found to be ineffective. The efforts set the conditions for the Soviets to sever all land and water connections between non-Soviet-occupied Germany and Berlin, leaving only airspace open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States responded with Operation Vittles and opened an air corridor into Berlin. In addition to flying supplies in, the United States repositioned nuclear-capable B-29 bombers to the United Kingdom. The military balance was complex. The Soviets maintained an overwhelming superiority in conventional forces in and around Berlin, while the United States had a nuclear monopoly. The combination of these different military balances is what many historians see as a key reason why World War III did not begin in 1948. Historians still debate how effective the blockade was in terms of its immediate tactical and operational objectives. At the strategic level, it served to mobilize Western support for confronting the Soviets. It also illustrated that the United States could sustain a counterblockade operation for almost a year, eventually wearing down the Soviets, and find indirect ways of using military force under the Truman Doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-a-quarantine-look-like&quot;&gt;What Would a Quarantine Look Like?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 20XX. As part of an escalating political and economic dispute between Beijing and Taipei, China announces that all air and naval traffic to Taiwan must first be routed through mainland ports and airfields in China. They also demand that all digital traffic to the island flow through servers on the mainland. To support the blockade, the PLA, through the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), deploys a mix of aircraft and naval ships to demonstrate its ability to isolate Taiwan and test international resolve. Simultaneously, the PLA begins to conduct large-scale maritime and air exercises near Taiwan. China also launches operations in the information, space, and cyber domains to achieve information dominance surrounding the island and complicate the operating picture for both Taiwan and international observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan refrains from attacking China’s military despite growing food and fuel shortages and massive disruptions to global supply chains. The United States and Japan respond, alongside a coalition of democratic nations, by challenging the de facto blockade with an air bridge while repositioning multiple carrier strike groups and partially executing time-phased force deployments linked to contingency plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the graduated blockade scenario is more likely than a major war, it is unlikely in the short term. China can use military exercises and shows of force short of causing significant economic disruption to, in the words of the Science of Military Strategy, “lead” a future crisis and develop opportunities for coercing Taipei. If Beijing opted to pursue a blockade, the economic consequences would be immediate and global, hitting everything from shipping insurance premiums to semiconductor prices, something China would struggle to absorb during its current economic downturn. As a result, Beijing would need to take steps to prepare for economic warfare and survive a counter-blockade and the severe economic downturn likely to emerge as a result of isolating Taiwan. At the same time, a quarantine is appealing to China’s leadership as a low-cost, low-risk means of coercing Taiwan into political concessions in comparison to a full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key decisions in a blockade scenario would be linked to the rules of engagement on each side and if and how each side opted to delegate decisions to use military force. A single spark would likely start a fire and lead to a rapid escalation spiral. Key indicators associated with a graduated blockade scenario would be evident in training and exercise of the PLAAF and PLAN as well as efforts by the CCP to create mechanisms to avoid the economic pain almost certain to accompany a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-scenario-four-exclusion-zones&quot;&gt;Alternative Scenario Four: Exclusion Zones&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an escalation beyond the quarantine scenario, China could impose a series of exclusion zones and periodically interdict air and maritime traffic to enforce the isolation of Taiwan, similar to the 1980 Tanker War. By declaring a series of exclusion zones and using a combination of irregular and military forces, such as the PLAAF and PLAN, as well as the Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) and the People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PLAMM), China may attempt to assert control rapidly over maritime and air access to the island without a large-scale maritime battle. In this scenario, China’s goal is not to immediately limit cargo or supplies from reaching the island but to demonstrate its coercive leverage over Taiwan. The desired outcome for China is to apply sufficient pressure to Taiwan’s leadership such that they capitulate to political demands, but also to avoid violent confrontation that invites the United States and other international parties into the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-tanker-war-19841988&quot;&gt;The Tanker War (1984–1988)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Iran-Iraq War, hundreds of ships owned or associated with either side were attacked in a series of anti-shipping operations collectively known as the Tanker War. Unlike the outbreak of fighting on land, the conflict at sea escalated in incremental steps. At the outset of the war, both sides declared maritime exclusion zones. Iran closed the Shatt al-Arab — a key inland river whose southern end constitutes the Iran-Iraq border and feeds directly into the Persian Gulf — to all maritime craft and warned that all coastal waters were battle areas. In response, Iraq declared the Gulf north of 29 degrees 30 minutes north latitude a prohibited war zone. As a bloody stalemate on land began to unfold between 1981 and 1984, the Iranian navy and air force targeted key military ports along Iraq’s small coastline. In retaliation, Iraq attacked Iranian shipping in the northern Gulf using hit-and-run tactics. International vessels occasionally found themselves entangled in the conflict, with the Turkish oil tanker Atlas 1 damaged by an Iraqi strike while loading Iranian oil at Kharg Island in May 1982.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1984, Iraq began intensifying its anti-shipping attacks and strikes against Iranian oil export infrastructure. In response, Iran finally retaliated by attacking ships linked to Iraq, including those belonging to Gulf states and other internationally flagged vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq’s decision to escalate its anti-shipping operations in 1984 coincided with fading hopes in Baghdad of a swift victory in the broader war. In addition to limiting Iran’s oil exports and applying economic pressure on Tehran, escalating the anti-shipping component of the conflict was an effort to increase the likelihood of international intervention. If Iraq could provoke Iran to retaliate with extreme measures, such as attempting to close the Strait of Hormuz (through which approximately 30 percent of the world’s oil passed at the time), international parties would have almost no choice but to get involved. Wary of such intervention, Iran limited its response to attacking ships attempting to transport supplies, war matériel, and Iraqi oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, amid growing fears that Iran might still lash out by closing the Strait of Hormuz and concerned of the very real possibility that Iraq may lose the broader war, direct international intervention finally came in 1987. During U.S. Operation Earnest Will, Kuwaiti tankers reflagged as American vessels and were provided escort up and down the Gulf by the U.S. Navy. U.S. intervention did not go unopposed by Tehran, and a series of confrontations occurred over the following 14 months. For example, a Silkworm antiship missile struck one of the reflagged tankers in October 1987. The U.S. Navy responded by shelling two Iranian bases in the Rostam oil field. Ultimately, American intervention in the Tanker War successfully suppressed Iranian anti-shipping activities, protected international shipping in the Gulf, and increased pressure on Iran to seek an end to the war in August 1988. In total, between 1981 and 1988, Iran conducted 282 anti-shipping attacks and Iraq conducted 208.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-an-exclusion-zone-look-like&quot;&gt;What Would an Exclusion Zone Look Like?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 20XX. After years of unsuccessful military pressure campaigns short of war and multiples crises, President Xi Jinping announces that China has declared an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around the island of Taiwan. During the same speech, he outlines the risk of “rogue political elements” in Taiwan that must be contained. Immediately after the speech, China releases details of new plans to periodically stop and inspect cargo traffic heading to Taiwan suspected of carrying material aid for these unspecified rogue elements. Behind the scenes, China assures major international firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited that their facilities will not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China deploys PLAMM and CCG to clutter sea lines of communication around Taiwan while patrolling the skies with mixed-combat air patrols equipped with antiship cruise missiles, air-to-air weapons, and electronic attack capabilities. Electronic and cyber interference disrupt commercial ship navigation systems. The net effect is a series of escalating interdiction opportunities. Any ship China deems to be carrying material support for the unspecified rogue elements is first swarmed by maritime militia ships that ram and obstruct the vessel. If the ship proceeds, the CCG officially declares its intention to board and inspect. If the ship still continues or is declared hostile, aircraft fire antiship cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing fires two antiship cruise missiles against a commercial cargo ship it claims refuses inspection, sinking a Turkish-flagged vessel and causing a spike in insurance premiums globally. While the ship owner claims there were no weapons or material military support, Chinese social media circulates falsified images of missiles on the ship. As a result, Beijing promises to increase the number of ships it is boarding and to directly attack any ship deemed at risk of carrying military support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the incident, Taiwan requests the United States, Japan, and Australia escort commercial ships to the island. Although food and other supplies have been largely allowed to enter the island after inspection, there is growing concern about Taiwan’s dependence on imported natural gas and its limited strategic reserves of energy resources. Wary of China’s ability to suffocate the island should it decide to cut off the import of energy supplies, food, or other crucial resources, the United States is compelled to act. The U.S. president orders the 7th Fleet to escort commercial oil and liquified natural gas (LNG) tankers to the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China tests international resolve by firing on an LNG cargo ship escorted by two U.S. guided-missile destroyers (DDGs). The destroyers successfully interdict four cruise missiles fired at the ship, but two Taiwanese F-16 fighters in the vicinity are shot down by long-range air-to-air missiles (e.g., PL-15s). The DDGs report significant electronic attacks on their systems and even laser dazzling interfering with navigation and key systems. Over the next three months, the world is on edge as the pattern repeats itself. Taiwan’s imports and exports are affected but not shut off, as different commercial firms assess the risk of trade. Of 2,000 ships that enter the exclusion zone over the 90-day period, only 100 are harassed and inspected and another 50 are attacked. Of the 50, 5 are sunk, and the U.S. Navy launches countermeasures to defend its DDGs three times, despite China’s claims that U.S. ships were not targeted. Taiwan loses another 10 aircraft and 4 surface combatants, mostly smaller attack platforms, as China avoids targeting larger frigates and destroyers. There is no major war, but a peace in the region seems beyond repair. The global economy is also in a recession, while each side blames the other for the escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China would be more likely to opt for a series of escalating exclusion zones than incur the immediate global fallout from a large blockade. The use of exclusion zones preserves the ability to escalate or de-escalate the crisis depending on how the international community reacts. Similar to the Tanker War, the pivotal decision is whether external powers, such as the United States, will escort commercial traffic. Unlike the Tanker War, however, the threshold for what will provoke U.S. engagement is vastly different. By the time the United States came to Kuwait’s aid in 1987, Iran and Iraq had been engaged in a brutal war for nearly seven years. By comparison, the threshold for what may provoke U.S. assistance to Taiwan in a future Indo-Pacific scenario is expected to be much lower, with the United States repeatedly signaling in recent years a growing intent to assist Taiwan should China take any military action against the island. Accordingly, the extent to which China resorts to violence, either intentionally or accidentally, will likely have significant impact on the severity and speed of any U.S. response. Moreover, as during the Tanker War, it may not take China wholly cutting off access to resources for the United States to respond. The fear alone that Beijing could order the interception of food or fuel at any time may be enough to push the United States into testing Beijing’s resolve using similar strategies that proved successful decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-scenario-five-air-and-missile-campaign&quot;&gt;Alternative Scenario Five: Air and Missile Campaign&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the next level of escalation, Beijing could opt to test the resolve of Taiwan’s population and political leadership through a series of air and missile strikes similar to NATO’s strikes in Kosovo and Serbia in 1999. The purpose of the operation would be to alter Taiwan’s domestic political calculus, but through a more direct application of military force alongside high-stakes diplomacy. The campaign would also test the resolve of the West while achieving intermediate military objectives linked to destroying Taiwan’s air force, major command and control facilities, and surface-to-surface and antiship cruise missile capability. Unlike Kosovo, the operation would take advantage of Chinese concepts and capabilities to wage a firepower strike campaign in lieu of a traditional air campaign. The campaign would also involve a firepower blitz and efforts to integrate electronic attack, cyber, and conventional fires to destroy key targets and paralyze Taiwan. The desired condition would be graduated military pressure on Taiwanese leaders sufficient to force them to accept Beijing’s political demands. The strategic approach would rely on shock and surprise to gain a position of advantage, narrowing the offramp options available in a blockade or exclusion scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;operation-allied-force-1999&quot;&gt;Operation Allied Force (1999)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 1999, NATO launched a campaign to degrade Serbia’s ability to prosecute its war in Kosovo. The campaign would last only 78 days and see extensive use of precision-strike capabilities alongside diplomatic pressure to force concessions by the Serbs. According to General Wesley Clark, the NATO supreme allied commander during the effort, the campaign was designed to “coerce, not to seize.” In addition to striking strategic targets, including infrastructure, and degrading military capacity, the campaign’s coercive effects were amplified by the looming threat of a ground invasion, risk of further political fracturing inside Serbia, and Belgrade’s inability to hold NATO aircraft at risk. In other words, Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic was on the horns of a dilemma. He had no way of changing the military balance and reducing strikes. The longer the war lasted, the larger the risk of domestic unrest. Commentators both in the West and in China saw the air power campaign as an ideal type for effects-based operations, elements of which survive in PLA planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-an-air-and-missile-raid-look-like&quot;&gt;What Would an Air and Missile Raid Look Like?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 20XX. After years of unsuccessful efforts to undermine Taiwan’s independence and sovereignty, Beijing opts for a limited air and missile campaign designed to shock leaders in Taipei and abroad while demonstrating its ability to execute a firepower strike system. The campaign begins with a fire blitz in which a mix of ballistic and cruise missiles hit Taiwanese military targets and political institutions while electronic attack and cyber operations paralyze command and control systems. Beijing moves to broadcast its own images and narratives in the immediate aftermath, effectively hijacking the airwaves and social media. China also continues to strike high-value targets including airfields, ammunition depots, and air defenses from distances that limit Taiwan’s options to counterattack by fire. There is no physical blockade of Taiwan, and there has only been a partial mobilization of key ground armies in China’s Eastern Theater Command since the campaign seeks to “coerce and destroy, not seize” ground in Taiwan. Beijing warns Washington and other nations through diplomatic channels that they risk being targeted if they enter a newly declared exclusion zone around Taipei, which China says is meant to protect commercial entities from being targeted. China openly pushes for commerce to continue, even going as far as offering additional insurance guarantees to firms to continue trading while they conclude their limited campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While an air and missile campaign is more likely than a major war, it is less likely than a political warfare campaign, escalating exclusion zones, or a blockade. Despite its bellicose rhetoric and continued double-digit increases in its defense budget, Beijing has limited its use of military force to date to military exercises and restrictive military operations similar to the crisis in August 2022 and the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis. These operations are designed to isolate the island and signal capability and resolve. Moving up the escalation ladder to a limited air and missile raid would be a significant departure from the status quo and risk a Ukraine-like situation in which democratic nations flood Taiwan with military, economic, and humanitarian assistance. For this reason, an air and missile raid would likely be proceeded by escalating exclusion zones or a quarantine to deter foreign military intervention, even if indirect and limited to supplying weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key decisions in this campaign for Beijing will be timing and target selection, finding the optimal window of opportunity, and balancing target-selection criteria with weapons inventory in the event Taiwan holds out for over 60 days. For Taipei, the key decision will be whether to risk a larger military confrontation by counterattacking launch platforms on mainland China. For the United States and its allies, the key decision is not if, but how to intervene in a manner that balances providing Taiwan the means to defend itself with an almost certain risk of Beijing responding with a warning strike against the U.S. military or even bases in Japan. Given Beijing’s current inventories of ballistic and cruise missiles, there would be limited warning of an air and missile strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-scenario-six-decapitation-raid&quot;&gt;Alternative Scenario Six: Decapitation Raid&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to its strategy of system destruction warfare, China could launch a special operations raid on Taiwan akin to the 1968 Blue House Raid in South Korea. The purpose would be to destabilize the Taiwan government by assassinating Taiwan’s political and military leaders. The principal method would be an infiltration of special operations forces (SOF) by air or sea to raid political and military targets. SOF teams would work alongside the PLA Strategic Support Forces to sabotage Taiwan communications and military defenses to disrupt crisis response by the Taiwan government. The desired condition would be to paralyze Taiwan’s political and military decisionmaking so that it loses the will and ability to resist a larger military operation or accept a political offramp to the crisis. In effect, these strikes and raids would disrupt the flow of information within Taiwan’s military, destroy critical functions within Taiwan’s government, and frustrate efforts to mount an effective defense while signaling the costs of resisting Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;blue-house-raid-1968&quot;&gt;Blue House Raid (1968)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1960s, Kim Il-sung and the Korean Workers’ Party’s leadership feared that an increase in South Korean domestic political stability, increasing partnerships with the United States and its allies, and a U.S. military shift to South Korea would make reunification impossible. Due to the strong economic policies of President Park Chung-hee and his Democratic Republican Party, support for domestic opposition parties decreased, and North Korea believed its ability to exploit internal divisions to destabilize South Korea’s government was shrinking. Increasing political, economic, and military ties with the United States and its allies also presented an inflection point where a conventional war to reunify the Korean Peninsula would result in a regional, rather than a local war. Lastly, concerns that North Vietnam would seek a negotiated settlement with the United States prompted fears that the United States would shift military forces to South Korea and take military actions against North Korea. Ultimately, South Korea’s strong domestic and international relations, as well as fears of the United States implementing an aggressive military strategy in the Korean Peninsula, prompted Kim Il-sung to order the assassination of President Park. With President Park’s death, South Korea would be destabilized, presenting future opportunities for reunification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 17, 1968, 31 members of North Korean SOF infiltrated South Korea en route to the South Korean presidential residence, the Blue House. The group took 48 hours to successfully penetrate the defense sector of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and move into position around Seoul. Radio intercepts of South Korean army patrols enabled these soldiers to prevent capture. On January 20, 1968, the SOF platoon moved within a few hundred meters of the Blue House, with the objective of assassinating President Park and a follow-on mission of destroying the U.S. Embassy. However, the SOF unit was discovered, failed to reach the Blue House to complete the assassination, and was pursued for several days until the soldiers were killed or captured. Their capture was in large part due to their discovery by two South Korean citizens, who reported the incursion to local police and mobilized counterguerrilla operations that resulted in their discovery. Although this raid narrowly failed, it signaled a serious weakness in South Korean defenses against irregular warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-a-decapitation-raid-look-like&quot;&gt;What Would a Decapitation Raid Look Like?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 20XX. The relationship between the United States and Taiwan continues to strengthen, resulting in more official and frequent U.S.-Taiwan military exercises and routine visits by bipartisan congressional delegations to Taipei. Senior CCP officials close to Xi Jinping insist that peaceful reunification is no longer feasible. They believe that Congress will ease the United States’ “One China Policy” in new legislation and transform Taiwan into a military outpost to counter China, which will result in strong political support in Taiwan for declaring independence. These fears prompt calls for destabilizing Taiwan’s government to prevent these domestic and international barriers to reunification. The CCP decides that conflict with Taiwan is inevitable and launches a special operations fait accompli to shock Taipei elites and set conditions should they need to launch a broader military invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA mobilizes one SOF brigade in the Southern Theater Command and the PLAN Marine Corps’ Sea Dragons Brigade to conduct the decapitation strike. The PLA begins by conducting electronic warfare and deception operations days prior to the deployment of SOF forces to create uncertainty for the Taiwan military over PLA intentions and disable radar systems to create air corridors for SOF infiltration. In addition, a PLA SOF company deploys to Taiwan 48 hours prior to the infiltration to conduct reconnaissance and advance targeting of key political, military, and command and control targets. On the day of the infiltration, PLA SOF units conduct air and sea insertions to seize airfields and seaports, raid key government and military buildings in Taipei, and sabotage command and control nodes around Formosa. PLA SOF units also employ cyber and information warfare capabilities to disrupt Taiwan communications on official government websites, social media, and in the news. These initial hours result in the successful assassination of key Taiwan government and military officials. Taiwan’s government is effectively paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although an intimidating scenario, a special operations fait accompli is very unlikely, owing to the difficulty of inserting and exfiltrating forces in a highly urbanized island. It is tempting to view recent statements from the Chinese government as indicative of a willingness to use force to reunify with Taiwan. However, it is more likely that China will continue to remain at a stalemate with Taiwan or use gray zone aggression to slowly encroach and reintegrate Taiwan into China. If this scenario did occur, key indicators would be capture or infiltration of Chinese SOF units, indicators of compromise within Taiwan’s cyber networks, increasing intensity of deception operations, and electronic warfare operations to degrade radar capabilities. The consequences would include prolonged land and naval conflict between China and Taiwan, international condemnation and strong sanctions against Beijing, and mobilization of the United States and its allies. It is hard to imagine Taiwan not responding with force if its political leaders are assassinated by uniformed Chinese combatants. A key decision to be made by Western leadership in this crisis would be whether to employ military force or use other instruments of national power to assist Taiwan in responding to the decapitation raid. This consideration is essentially a balance seen today with the war in Ukraine — how can the West adequately support an invaded nation while limiting the risks of horizontal and vertical escalation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;looking-back-to-look-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Back to Look Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While no single scenario is predictive, looking across the historical cases helps policymakers visualize and describe the dilemmas likely to confront key stakeholders in Taiwan over the next 10 years. History offers a set of plausible examples of crisis dynamics. China has coercive alternatives it can exhaust before incurring the costs and risks of a large-scale amphibious invasion and prolonged occupation of Taiwan. Unlike earlier crises, these alternatives will almost certainly involve unexplored domain dynamics, and private sector firms will be forced to create means for coordination across different actors as the world seeks to avoid war without conceding to threats from Beijing. In this multistakeholder, competitive environment, the United States can best deter war by creating focal points for coordination and using international standards to signal all parties. This new escalation management framework provides a blueprint for realizing the promises of integrated deterrence. This logic produces five key recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch a series of interagency, multistakeholder crisis simulations to develop a new escalation management framework.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At the strategic level, the U.S. government, likely through the National Security Council, needs to launch a series of interagency, multistakeholder crisis simulations to develop a new escalation management framework. The historical cases reviewed here show that confrontation and conflict can take place short of war and involve a diverse set of actors. Understanding how private sector firms, partner nations, and even different agencies in the U.S. government respond to complex threats is therefore a key information gap. At the same time, integrated deterrence calls for better synchronizing different instruments of power and international partners while increasing joint all-domain interoperability. The theory is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. While likely true, there is a maze of bureaucratic obstacles and policies that make interagency, much less multilateral, coordination difficult. Without a better understanding of these obstacles, legacy bureaucratic structures could limit the potential of integrated deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These information gaps create a need for an entirely new approach to wargaming and crisis simulation. Traditionally, these activities have been closed, classified events that favor secrecy over transparency and hypothesis testing. They also tend to take place in sponsor stovepipes, with individual services or narrow elements of the defense establishment running games and holding on to the results to gain an information advantage in the budgeting process or in advancing their preferred plans. The opposite is true when trying to address coordination challenges, which require a broader set of players to identify where and how cooperation and coordination can break down. Imagine a blockade game in which representatives from the private sector — whether chambers of commerce or corporate representatives from individual firms — sit alongside non-official delegations from the United States, Japan, and Taiwan. Even more radical, but no less important, imagine a multitrack diplomatic exchange in which U.S., Chinese, and private sector officials discuss how economic and military instruments of power collide in an escalating crisis alongside challenges associated with limiting escalation in space and cyberspace. States can share an understanding of risk without compromising privileged information about their intentions and plans. In doing so, the resulting transparency helps calibrate cost, benefit, and restraint calculations at the heart of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This logic means that the United States should explore multitrack diplomacy with China that involves crisis simulations that help each side — from Washington and Beijing to business leaders — understand how all parties might react in a future crisis. The transparency serves a purpose. It helps businesses better assess risk while reminding Beijing of the economic costs of a significant escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a new escalation management framework.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The net result of these multistakeholder crisis games should be a new escalation management framework. Policymakers need a clear list of flexible response and deterrent options they can use in an unfolding crisis that has been stress-tested and analyzed through a mix of red teaming and gaming. The list of options should be validated annually and subject to congressional scrutiny. While there certainly will be classified annexes, an unclassified list will help encourage broader crosstalk with the private sector and partners as well as in executive-level communication with Beijing critical to managing a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsor a series of counter-blockade games.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At the operational level, the U.S. military should sponsor a series of counter-blockade games that include counterspace vignettes alongside complex misinformation campaigns and the employment of limited air and missile engagements. These games will help Taiwan determine how best to posture their forces to make it more costly for Beijing to blockade the island for a prolonged period. The 1948 Italian election, Berlin Airlift, and Tanker War show the enduring importance of the information environment alongside the air and maritime domains. Taiwan is a globally connected island, amplifying the likelihood that China will use space, cyber, air, and naval means to isolate the island. The open question is how likely cross-domain escalation is to occur and the extent to which Beijing can achieve its objectives through other domains short of occupying Taiwan. The first step toward tailoring a deterrent strategy to a Taiwan contingency is therefore to map these domain-specific dynamics across a diverse set of stakeholders. The findings from these analytical games could be used by the Biden administration to inform foreign military sales as well as defense planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispatch interagency teams to help Taiwan refine continuity of the presidency and government planning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United States and its partners should dispatch interagency teams to help Taiwan refine continuity of the presidency and government planning. The Blue House case shows the importance of preparing for the possibility a hostile foreign state targets political leaders to create a crisis it can exploit. Unlike the Blue House case, the information environment would play a key role, with MDM activities exploiting the chaos to shape public opinion. As a result, it is not just Secret Service, FBI, or select military teams that are required to help key partners such as Taiwan develop the force protection and continuity of government protocols. Partners such as Taiwan — including civil society organizations — also need support from Western nonprofits and government agencies to combat MDM campaigns as well as complex cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, a Kosovo-type scenario in Taiwan would also include steps to neutralize Taiwan’s political leaders. As a result, continuity of the presidency and government planning needs to include helping Taiwan figure out how best to alert and protect leaders without disrupting their ability to command and control military operations. This planning must include variable timelines that help Taiwan and the international community better assess how long Taiwan could hold out against a sustained series of air and missile strikes, especially if they occurred alongside a blockade. That type of planning works best when private sector logistical expertise is brought in to help discuss topics ranging from port operations to warehouse management. There is precedent for involving a diverse set of stakeholders to analyze continuity planning, such as the Continuity of Government Commission, funded by the private sector and nonprofits, following the September 11 attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initiate a major new nuclear arms control regime.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, nuclear weapons played a significant role in two of the six explored historical cases. In the Berlin Airlift, the movement of nuclear-capable bombers to bases in the United Kingdom limited the Soviet response options. In the Note Crisis, nuclear tests played a key role in a larger coercive diplomatic campaign. While China has not signaled it will change its nuclear policy, it is increasing its capabilities and could decide to alter its policies in the future. Therefore, the United States needs to initiate a major new nuclear arms control regime involving Beijing and other nuclear states. The world cannot afford a multipolar nuclear competition, which would almost certainly involve more risk than the bipolar Cold War. It should be a top priority to use formal treaties and regimes to mitigate proliferation risk and to limit incentives to use nuclear blackmail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What these recommendations share is an emphasis on using transparency and international standards to reduce uncertainty and adding credible communication channels to international crises. Creating, testing, and communicating clear international standards around maritime law and boarding ships, as well as working with the private sector to create playbooks for identifying and countering misinformation campaigns, denies China, as well as other actors, the ability to support coercive campaigns. If China decides to take military action against Taiwan, it can. Beijing has a favorable correlation of forces, and the status of Taiwan is a salient issue for the CCP. While no one can stop Beijing from making the decision to use force, they can be sure that China’s leaders do so with a clear understanding of the real costs associated with taking a military path to victory. The clearer these costs and the more uncertain operational objectives and timelines become, the more likely Beijing is to avoid crossing the line.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet crucial questions remain about the dynamics shaping the Taiwan Strait. What is China’s approach to Taiwan and how long is Beijing willing to wait for Taiwan’s unification? Will China use significant military force against Taiwan, and when? How does Beijing view the potential of U.S. intervention in a Taiwan contingency?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To shed light on these questions, ChinaPower polled 64 leading experts on the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Taiwan, and cross-Strait relations. The experts polled include 28 former high-level U.S. government (USG) officials from both Democrat and Republican administrations, as well as 23 former USG policy and intelligence analysts and 13 top experts from academia and think tanks. Responses were collected from August 10–September 8, 2022, amid the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis. Key takeaways from the survey are shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-strategy-for-taiwan&quot;&gt;China’s Strategy for Taiwan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the most basic level, China’s overall approach to Taiwan hinges on two main questions: does China have a clear strategy to achieve unification and how patiently is it willing to wait? The experts polled by our survey broadly believe that Beijing does not have a strategy and that it is willing to wait to achieve unification — but not forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked whether Beijing has “a coherent internal strategy and roadmap, with concrete stages and actionable next steps,” 80 percent of respondents said “no.” There was no significant difference in responses to this question based on the identity of the respondents: former senior USG officials and other respondents broadly agree on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MJnHB61.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;China lacks a coherent strategy for Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “Does Beijing have a coherent internal strategy and roadmap, with concrete stages and actionable next steps, to achieve peaceful unification with Taiwan?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general assessment that China lacks a coherent strategy is a reflection of public opinion polls in Taiwan, which consistently show that Taiwan’s citizens are not interested in unification with China. Under President Tsai Ing-wen, Taipei has also rejected China’s proposed “one country, two systems” offer and watched as Beijing cracked down on Hong Kong and reversed promises of autonomy for the Chinese special administrative region. China’s inability to win the hearts and minds of the Taiwan government and people has led Beijing to increasingly leverage coercive tools against the island, including threats to use significant military force. These dynamics raise serious questions as to whether China has a coherent strategy for peaceful unification with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linked to China’s overall strategy are Beijing’s assessments of the necessary conditions for unification with the island. Only 10 percent of respondents think Beijing’s approach is to push for unification “at the earliest possible opportunity.” The overwhelming majority (84 percent) of respondents say “Beijing is willing to wait for unification but will not accept the status quo permanently.” For this group, there is likely an assessment that Beijing is willing to wait because the conditions — political, economic, or military — are not yet optimal for China to achieve peaceful or forceful unification. Only 6 percent believe Beijing is willing to permanently accept the status quo — wherein Taiwan is self-governed but Taipei has not declared independence — and none of the 64 respondents think that China would ever accept Taiwan independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JKLw5BA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Beijing is willing to wait for Taiwan’s unification, but not forever.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “For Beijing, is there any other acceptable outcome for Taiwan aside from unification?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-timeline-for-unification&quot;&gt;China’s Timeline for Unification&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most hotly debated questions revolve around China’s timeline for unification. These questions are crucial, since a desire by Beijing to stick to a certain timeline could compel China to ramp up coercive measures or even military attacks to achieve its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked if Beijing has set a “hard internal deadline for resolving the Taiwan issue,” 44 percent of respondents said Beijing has set a hard deadline to achieve unification by 2049. This is not an arbitrary year. Authoritative Chinese sources, including the 2022 white paper on Taiwan, have closely linked Taiwan’s unification with the concept of “national rejuvenation” — a nebulous goal that Chinese leaders aim to achieve by 2049 to mark the centennial of the PRC’s founding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts believe that 2049 is only a soft benchmark for China and not a hard deadline. As a result, some selected 2072 as the hard deadline for China to achieve unification, believing that 50 years from 2022 is the longest time China could give itself. Others (42 percent) selected the option that Beijing is willing to wait indefinitely as long as it still sees unification as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TyMvLMO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Divided views on China’s deadlines for unifying Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “Has Beijing set a hard internal deadline for resolving the Taiwan issue?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since experts do not formulate their assessments in a vacuum, the poll sought to gauge whether China’s recent unprecedented military exercises around Taiwan reflect changes in Beijing’s timelines. A large majority (80 percent) believe that the recent exercises do not indicate that China is accelerating its timeline for using large-scale military force against Taiwan. Notably, however, 29 percent of former senior USG officials believe the exercises do indicate a timeline shift while only 14 percent of other respondents hold that view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r6nemOH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;China’s August 2022 military exercises do not indicate an acceleration of plans to use force.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “Do China’s unprecedented August 2022 military exercises against Taiwan indicate that Beijing is accelerating its timeline for using large-scale military force (i.e., a blockade or invasion) against the island?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;xi-jinpings-third-term&quot;&gt;Xi Jinping’s Third Term&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s approach toward Taiwan over the next five years will be heavily shaped by Chinese leader Xi Jinping. He is China’s most powerful leader in generations, and he has abolished the two term limit on his power. Xi is set to begin his third five-year term in October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Xi, China has significantly ramped up pressure on Taiwan. There has been U.S. and international media speculation that the year 2027 — which will mark the end of Xi’s third term and also the centennial of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) — is a likely time period by which Xi will decide to use force against Taiwan to achieve unification. Xi’s own statements have also been interpreted by some as an indication that he seeks to resolve the Taiwan issue under his watch. In 2013 and 2019, Xi commented that the Taiwan issue should not be passed down from generation to generation. Yet he has been careful to not explicitly and publicly specify a date by which China needs to unify with Taiwan or use force against the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts polled by our survey broadly rejected the idea that China must act against Taiwan by 2027. About 83 percent of respondents assess that China does not plan to use significant kinetic military force against Taiwan by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7gNiVcH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Few expect China to use significant force against Taiwan by 2027.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “There has been speculation by the media and some analysts that China plans to use significant kinetic military force against Taiwan by 2027. Do you believe this is true?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s lack of a plan to use significant military force against Taiwan does not mean that Beijing will sit idly by. Indeed, 79 percent of respondents assess that Xi will move beyond a more passive focus on deterring perceived Taiwan independence and instead prioritize making progress toward peaceful unification during his third term. This means that Beijing will need to be much more active — and likely more coercive — toward Taiwan to create the conditions for unification. This could involve more unilateral moves on Beijing’s end to impose its sovereignty and control over the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 9 percent of respondents believe that Xi feels China has exhausted all peaceful options and will feel compelled in his third term to unify Taiwan through coercive measures or military force. This corresponds closely to the 9 percent that believe Beijing will seek unification at the earliest possible opportunity (See above in the section on “China’s Strategy for Taiwan”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5jurd3P.png&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Xi Jinping will prioritize making progress on peaceful unification.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “What do you assess as Xi Jinping’s main priority for Taiwan after the 20th Party Congress, during his next term (2022-2027)?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-risk-of-a-taiwan-contingency&quot;&gt;The Risk of a Taiwan Contingency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cross-Strait tensions have flared in recent years, so has the likelihood of a military conflict or accident. Three of the survey’s questions sought to gauge experts’ assessments about the risks of various military contingencies in the next ten years. Their responses indicate a belief that a full amphibious invasion of Taiwan is possible — but more unlikely than not — while a more limited Chinese use of force and a military accident are fairly likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked how likely it is that China will engage in an amphibious invasion of Taiwan in the next ten years, 63 percent of experts responded that it is possible. Another 27 percent feel an invasion is unlikely. Only 8 percent think an invasion is likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on responses to other questions in the survey, these results indicate that most experts do not believe China proactively seeks to invade Taiwan in the next ten years. Instead, Beijing could feel compelled to do so if China views Taiwan or the United States as crossing unacceptable redlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HZy3VaM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;An amphibious invasion of Taiwan is possible in the next 10 years.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “Within the next ten years, how likely is it that China will engage in an amphibious invasion of Taiwan with the goal of gaining control of Taipei?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While experts were unsure about the likelihood of an amphibious invasion, they were much more willing to believe that in the next 10 years China would “deliberately escalate its use of force short of invasion,” for example by blockading Taiwan. A slight majority believe that such a scenario is either likely (30 percent) or very likely (22 percent). However, a plurality (44 percent) still view this as possible. Only 5 percent believe it is unlikely and no experts believe it is not at all likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents were even more likely to think that an “unintended military accident or collision will take place in or near the Taiwan Strait.” While a plurality (39 percent) still believe an accident or collision is possible, 34 percent believe such a scenario is likely and 22 percent believe it is very likely. Only 5 percent believe it is unlikely and no experts believe it is not at all likely. Notably, there were not major differences in views between former senior officials and other respondents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gwd3A2Y.png&quot; alt=&quot;image9&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Other Taiwan contingencies are more likely than an invasion.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “Within the next 10 years, how likely is it that ____ ?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-chinese-responses-to-us-and-taiwan-actions&quot;&gt;Potential Chinese Responses to U.S. and Taiwan Actions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also important to China’s plans for Taiwan is how China might respond to potential U.S. and Taiwan actions. Beijing could feel that it must respond by using military force. Respondents largely agree that China would invade if Taiwan declared independence and that Beijing would respond strongly and negatively if Washington dropped its long-held approach of strategic ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Beijing has repeatedly made known its objection to Taiwan independence. The PLA’s unprecedented August 2022 exercises were targeted at deterring “separatist activities” on the island, and Beijing has taken other measures such as sanctioning Taiwan officials that it has labeled “independence diehards.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey respondents appear to take Beijing’s concerns seriously. More than three-quarters of the experts polled said that China would invade Taiwan immediately (within six months) if Taipei declared independence. There was little variation in this belief among different groups of respondents. Compared to other respondents, former senior USG officials were only slightly more likely to say China would invade (79 percent versus 75 percent). Even among the 23 percent that do not believe China would invade Taiwan immediately, some still believe that China could use significant force against Taiwan. This could involve launching a blockade or engaging in unprecedented, large military exercises targeting Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ANabW1k.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;China would invade Taiwan immediately if Taipei declared independence.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “If Taipei declared independence, would Beijing invade Taiwan immediately (within the next six months)?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents were somewhat more sanguine about how Beijing would respond to a decision by Washington to end its long-held policy of strategic ambiguity — a policy wherein the United States does not say whether or not it would come to Taiwan’s defense. None of the polled experts believe China would respond to an end of strategic ambiguity by immediately invading Taiwan. Instead, 64 percent of polled experts expect that China would “respond negatively and significantly, provoking a U.S.-China or China-Taiwan crisis.” An additional 31 percent say that China would instead “respond negatively in a more limited way,” mainly lodging diplomatic protests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only two respondents believe that an official U.S. policy shift to defend Taiwan would deter China from using force against Taiwan, and only one respondent assesses that China would not respond to the U.S. policy change. As shown in the next section, most experts do not believe ending U.S. strategic ambiguity would deter China from using force against Taiwan because Beijing already assumes that the U.S. military would come to Taiwan’s defense. Instead, Beijing is likely to view a change in U.S. policy as further provocation and as an effort to support Taiwan independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dPwlfgB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;China would provoke a crisis if the United States ends strategic ambiguity.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “How would Beijing respond if the United States ended its policy of strategic ambiguity in favor of strategic clarity to defend Taiwan?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-thinking-on-us-resolve&quot;&gt;Chinese Thinking on U.S. Resolve&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts polled in this survey think Beijing already assumes the United States will intervene militarily to defend Taiwan. Many also believe that Chinese leaders fear the U.S. still has a military advantage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey participants were asked to assess how far Beijing expects the United States would be willing to go to defend Taiwan in the event of an unprovoked Chinese invasion of Taiwan. They were given multiple options ranging from providing no support for Taiwan to bearing any military costs to defend the island. None of the experts assess that China believes Washington will provide no support or simply stop at political and economic aid. All respondents think China believes the United States would be willing to also deploy troops in Taiwan’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts diverge, however, on how far the United States would be willing to go to defend Taiwan. About 30 percent believe China assesses the United States is willing to deploy troops to defend Taiwan but is not willing to bear significant costs. Most respondents (66 percent) think Beijing has assessed that the United States is willing to go further by bearing substantial costs but will seek to contain the military conflict to the Indo-Pacific region. The remaining 5 percent think China sees the U.S. as willing to risk any cost, including a global war and attacks on the continental United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0QK1acg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Beijing expects U.S. military intervention in a conflict over Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt; Respondents unanimously believe Beijing expects the United States is willing to provide political and economic support and deploy forces to defend Taiwan, but they differ over what the United States is willing to bear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these responses were specifically about a scenario in which the PLA launches an “unprovoked” invasion. If Taiwan were to provoke a Chinese attack by unilaterally declaring independence or by escalating through a preemptive military strike, Washington may be far less willing to come to Taiwan’s aid. Beijing is aware of this, and a different scenario would therefore likely be interpreted differently by Chinese leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widespread belief that China anticipates a U.S. military response is notable given that most respondents also think Beijing is uncertain about its capabilities vis-à-vis the United States. In the context of a Chinese amphibious invasion scenario in the next five years, about 41 percent believe Beijing is uncertain about U.S. capabilities but think Beijing “has confidence in its growing military capabilities.” This reflects the fact that China has invested significant resources to train and modernize the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Beijing is uncertain about its military capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Question: “If China invaded Taiwan between now and 2027, does Beijing believe the United States has the military capability to defend Taipei and prevent China from executing a successful amphibious invasion?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the PLA has not engaged in a major conventional conflict since the China-Vietnam war in 1979 and an amphibious invasion of Taiwan would amount to an extremely complex and difficult military operation. Most respondents (55 percent) consequently think that Beijing believes the United States still has a military advantage, indicating a belief that the United States and its allies could mount a considerable defense of Taiwan. Only 2 percent say that Beijing believes the United States could not repel a Chinese invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of this survey offer valuable insights into the thinking of many of the leading experts on cross-Strait dynamics and Indo-Pacific security issues — including those who have shaped not only public discourse but also U.S. government policy. Taken together, their views suggest a consensus along the following lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is determined to unify with Taiwan, but Beijing does not have a coherent strategy. Experts in the poll unanimously agree that Beijing will not accept Taiwan’s independence. At the same time, most experts assess that China does not have a coherent strategy for unification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is willing to wait to unify with Taiwan, and the August 2022 exercises are not an indicator of accelerated PRC timelines. Most respondents believe Beijing is willing to wait decades — or even indefinitely — to achieve its goals. Experts are split nearly evenly over whether China has set a hard deadline to achieve unification by 2049 or whether it is willing to wait indefinitely. Only a small share of experts believe China has a hard deadline to unify Taiwan in the next 15 years or less. Most do not view China’s unprecedented military exercise in August 2022 as an indicator that China has accelerated its timeline to use force against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping feels there are still avenues to peaceful unification. A large majority of experts believe Xi will prioritize making progress on peaceful unification during his third term (2022–2027). Few experts — and no former senior U.S. government officials — believe Xi has concluded that China has exhausted all peaceful options. Most respondents reject speculation that Xi intends to use force against Taiwan by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The potential for a military crisis or conflict in the Taiwan Strait is very real. While very few think a full amphibious invasion of Taiwan is likely in the next ten years, a majority say it is possible. Other scenarios short of an invasion — such as a blockade or a military accident or collision — are likelier than not in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China would immediately invade if Taiwan declared independence. Experts were largely in agreement that a declaration of independence would provoke an invasion. China would respond more limitedly — but still negatively and strongly — to an ending of U.S. strategic ambiguity, likely by provoking a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China assumes that the United States would intervene in a Taiwan conflict. Experts in the survey unanimously agree that Beijing assumes the U.S. military would deploy forces to intervene and defend Taiwan in a conflict, and a slight majority of experts think Beijing still worries that the United States has a military edge. Accordingly, almost no respondents believe that ending the U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity would deter China from using force against Taiwan, since Beijing already assumes Washington will intervene.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin likely intends annexation to freeze the war along the current frontlines and allow time for Russian mobilization to reconstitute Russian forces. The annexation of parts of four Ukrainian oblasts does not signify that Putin has abandoned his stated objective of destroying the Ukrainian state for a lesser goal. As ISW assessed in May, if Putin’s annexation of occupied Ukraine stabilizes the conflict along new front lines, “the Kremlin could reconstitute its forces and renew its invasion of Ukraine in the coming years, this time from a position of greater strength and territorial advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s annexation speech made several general references to nuclear use that are consistent with his past language on the subject, avoiding making the direct threats that would be highly likely to precede nuclear use. Putin alluded to Russia’s willingness to use “all available means” to defend claimed Russian territory, a common Kremlin talking point. Putin stated that “the US is the only country in the world that twice used nuclear weapons, destroying the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Incidentally, they created a precedent.” Putin stretched his historical allusions, stating that the United States and the United Kingdom demonstratively and without a military need destroyed many German cities during World War II with the “sole goal, just like in the case of nuclear bombardments in Japan, to scare our country and the entire world,” attempting to portray Western states as the true aggressor. Putin did not directly articulate any new red lines or overtly threaten to use a nuclear weapon against Ukraine if Ukrainian counteroffensives continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin is attempting to force Kyiv to the negotiating table by annexing Russian-occupied territory and threatening nuclear use. He is following the trajectory that ISW forecasted he might on May 13. As ISW wrote at the time: “A Russian annexation would seek to present Kyiv with a fait accompli that precludes negotiations on territorial boundaries even for a ceasefire by asserting that Russia will not discuss the status of (illegally annexed through military conquest) Russian territory — the argument the Kremlin has used regarding Crimea since 2014.” Predictably, Putin demanded that Ukraine return to negotiations in his September 30 speech announcing annexation and precluded any discussion of returning illegally annexed Ukrainian territory to Kyiv’s control: “We call on the Kyiv regime to immediately cease all fire and hostilities and end the war it initiated in 2014 and return to the negotiations table. We are ready for it and have said that several times. But the decision of the people in Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson we will not negotiate. This choice has been made and Russia will not betray it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s call for negotiations and implicit nuclear threats are aimed at both Ukraine and the West; he likely incorrectly assesses that his nuclear brinksmanship will lead the United States and its allies to pressure Ukraine to negotiate. As ISW wrote in May: “The Kremlin could threaten to use nuclear weapons against a Ukrainian counteroffensive into annexed territory to deter the ongoing Western military aid that would enable such a counteroffensive.” However, Ukraine and its international backers have made clear that they will not accept negotiations at gunpoint and will not renounce Ukraine’s sovereign right to its territories. As Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on September 20, “Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say.” Where does this leave Putin, then, and what are the actual prospects for the Russian use of nuclear weapons?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISW cannot forecast the point at which Putin would decide to use nuclear weapons. Such a decision would be inherently personal, but Putin’s stated red lines for nuclear weapon use have already been crossed in this war several times over without any Russian nuclear escalation. Reported Ukrainian cross-border raids into Belgorod Oblast and strikes against Russian-occupied Crimea could arguably meet the stated Russian nuclear use threshold of “aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy.” Putin framed Ukraine as posing an existential threat to Russian sovereignty repeatedly at the start of his full-scale invasion — a phrase that meets that stated threshold: “For our country, it is a matter of life and death, a matter of our historical future as a nation. … It is not only a very real threat to our interests but to the very existence of our state and to its sovereignty. It is the red line which we have spoken about on numerous occasions,” he said on February 24. Formal Russian nuclear doctrine is evidently not a deciding factor for Putin, who has reportedly been micromanaging this war down to the operational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has set in motion two major means short of nuclear use through which he will try to achieve his objectives: partial mobilization to replace Russian losses, and wintertime energy pressures on Europe to deter European support. He likely intends Russia’s ongoing mobilization to stabilize Russian positions and enable the temporary freezing of the conflict. He is unlikely to succeed; rushing thousands of untrained and unmotivated Russian men to the front will not meaningfully increase Russian combat power, particularly in places like western Luhansk oblast where the Ukrainian counteroffensives are making significant progress. Putin intends his second approach, curtailing natural gas exports to Europe, to fracture the Western consensus around supporting Ukraine and limit Western military aid to Ukrainian forces. This too is unlikely to succeed; Europe is in for a cold and difficult winter, yet the leaders of NATO and non-NATO European states have not faltered in their support for Ukrainian sovereignty and may increase that support in light of Russia’s illegal annexation even in the face of economic costs. European states are actively finding alternatives to Russian energy and will likely be far more prepared by winter 2023. It is difficult to assess what indicators Putin will use to evaluate the success of either effort. But both will take considerable time to bear fruit or to demonstrably fail, time Putin will likely take before considering a nuclear escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin would likely need to use multiple tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine to achieve his desired operational effect — freezing the front lines and halting Ukrainian counteroffensives. But the operational effect would need to outweigh the potentially very high costs of possible NATO retaliation. Putin might try a nuclear terror attack against one or more major Ukrainian population centers or critical infrastructure in hopes of shocking Ukraine into surrender or the West into cutting off aid to Ukraine. Such attacks would be highly unlikely to force Ukraine or the West to surrender, however, and would be tremendous gambles of the sort that Putin has historically refused to take. Ukraine’s government and people have repeatedly demonstrated their will to continue fighting, and the West would find it very challenging simply to surrender in the face of such horrific acts because of the precedent such surrender would set. Putin is therefore far more likely to use nuclear weapons to change the operational environment, if he uses them at all. We assess Putin has two main tactical nuclear weapon use options: striking key Ukrainian ground lines of communication nodes and command centers to paralyze Ukrainian offensive operations, and/or striking major Ukrainian force concentrations near the line of contact. A single nuclear weapon would not be decisive against either of these target sets. Putin would likely need to use several tactical nuclear weapons across Ukraine to achieve significant effects and disrupt Ukraine’s ability to conduct counteroffensives. The scale of nuclear use likely required would raise the risks of Western retaliation, likely increasing the potential costs Putin would have to weigh against the likely temporary benefits the strikes themselves might provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian nuclear use would therefore be a massive gamble for limited gains that would not achieve Putin’s stated war aims. At best, Russian nuclear use would freeze the front lines in their current positions and enable the Kremlin to preserve its currently occupied territory in Ukraine. Russian nuclear use would not enable Russian offensives to capture the entirety of Ukraine (the Kremlin’s original objective for their February 2022 invasion). Russian military doctrine calls for the Russian Armed Forces to be able to effectively fight on a nuclear battlefield, and the “correct” doctrinal use of tactical nuclear weapons would involve tactical nuclear strikes to punch holes in Ukrainian lines, enabling Russian mechanized units to conduct an immediate attack through the targeted area and drive deep into Ukrainian rear areas. The degraded, hodgepodge Russian forces currently operating in Ukraine cannot currently conduct effective offensive operations even in a non-nuclear environment. They will be flatly unable to operate on a nuclear battlefield. DNR/LNR proxy units, Wagner Group fighters, BARS reservist units, and the depleted remnants of the Russian conventional units that actually exercised fighting on a nuclear battlefield in annual exercises — not to mention newly mobilized replacements shipped to the front lines with less than a week of training — will not have the equipment, training, and morale necessary to conduct offensive operations following nuclear use. NATO is additionally likely to respond to Russian nuclear weapon use in Ukraine with conventional strikes on Russian positions there. Russian use of multiple weapons (which would be required to achieve decisive operational effects) would only increase the likelihood and scale of a Western conventional response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more confident Putin is that nuclear use will not achieve decisive effects but will draw direct Western conventional military intervention in the conflict, the less likely he is to conduct a nuclear attack.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mason Clark, Katherine Lawlor, et al.</name></author><summary type="html">Putin did not threaten an immediate nuclear attack to halt the Ukrainian counteroffensives into Russian-occupied Ukraine during his speech claiming Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/t3l4t5Q.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/t3l4t5Q.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Mass, Mobl. &amp;amp; Reserve Forces</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-09-30-mass-mobl-reserve-forces.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mass, Mobl. &amp;amp; Reserve Forces" /><published>2022-09-30T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-09-30T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/mass-mobl-reserve-forces</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-09-30-mass-mobl-reserve-forces.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The war in Ukraine has demonstrated the importance of mass. Quantity has a quality all of its own, but regular soldiers are expensive. Most of the Ukrainians fighting in the current war are not regular soldiers, and reserve units like the valiant Azov battalion, who held Mariupol for so long, have played a critical role.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our European allies have grown, or are growing, volunteer reserves to constitute a large component of an affordable peacetime framework that can deliver capacity in the event of war. As an island nation whose armed forces have an expeditionary focus, our best comparators are our Anglophone counterparts in the Five Eyes pact – countries that share an expeditionary focus and a tradition of voluntarism rather than conscription. They too have a much greater emphasis on reserves than does the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparisons ranging from the First World War to Operation Herrick suggest that citizen soldiers can perform strongly – sometimes truly remarkably – when they have trained and played together and when they deploy with the right, volunteer, leadership. In contrast, repeated use of UK reserves to provide individual augmentees for regular units at the end of operations in Afghanistan disenfranchised the reserve officer cadre, and it has taken years to partially recover. To rebuild UK armed forces for mass, we need to focus on proven principles for the volunteer reserves, while bringing in the latest technologies and ideas from the civilian world. Reserve forces have done this very often in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the Army element of the Integrated Review, Future Soldier, proposes a structure which both wrecks the ‘offer’ to officers and strikes at the heart of unit spirit by reducing unit size below viability for realistic training; it includes a 10% cut in reserve establishments and strips the infantry of most of its anti-tank weapons and mortars, destroying their credibility as formed units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect of these detrimental proposals is compounded by several other factors: a recruiting apparatus wholly controlled by regular officers turned off efforts for much of last year to concentrate on regulars; a whole series of mobilisation experiments have ended in muddle because of an absence of reserve expertise in the departments concerned; and the pipeline for special-to-arm training is uneven in quality, with much of it delivering a sluggish, repetitive experience for soldiers who are required to have a higher educational standard than their regular counterparts. Not surprisingly, reserve numbers are falling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a more fundamental level, all our major Five Eyes partners have their reserves grouped in regional brigades (as Britain used to do), and in their case such brigades are commanded by reservists. Instead, for a generation, our reserves have been woven into the UK’s byzantine regular brigade structure, with units answering to different commanders in different parts of the country for operations, on the one hand, and for recruiting and administration on the other. The introduction of regional brigades recommended in this paper would solve the problem of split authorities and remove the geographic- and command-span complexities of the current model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forthcoming reshaping under the auspices of the Integrated Review, and the prospect of more resources for defence, offer an opportunity to reconsider the shape and use of the reserves. A target should be to expand the Army Reserve from roughly one-third to approximately 80% the size of the Regular Army, in line with the average of the UK’s Anglophone sister countries. This should include substantially increasing the current shrunken establishment of units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structural reforms are also needed. Some of these are in governance at the Defence level. Reserve budgets should be separately identified and ringfenced to prevent them becoming the first port of call for cuts, and a new three-star reserve post should be introduced with direct access to ministers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improvements to recruiting are needed, with a much greater focus on attracting students and driving down the long delays in the process. Training should be more modularised and more often delivered by units themselves or regionally by (reserve-led) Army Training Units. Those arms schools where progress in distribution and modularisation lags behind should be required to introduce ‘competency-based’ training whereby individuals can take rigorous tests without taking the course, introducing competition into training. Reserve units should be restored to regional brigades, and those should be commanded by part-time reservists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mass is back in the news as we watch a whole nation mobilised and fighting in Ukraine. Technology is more important than ever, and reservists come from the civilian world, where technology use is more advanced – as can be seen in the astonishingly fast development of the Lewes bomb by the (citizen-led) SAS in the Second World War or in the innovations reservists have recently provided during the coronavirus pandemic. Britain needs more fighting power delivered through reserves as an affordable route to mass, and reservists must have a greater role in leading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Hague commented in The Times on 2 May 2022: ‘Higher spending needs to go into the necessities of large-scale and lengthy warfare … [including] the ability to mobilise a far larger, trained reserve within our own populations. Britain … needs many more reservists.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s 2021 Integrated Review (published before Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine) and NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept highlight Russia as the most acute threat to European security. These publications, and the Chief of the General Staff in his address at the RUSI Land Warfare Conference, refocus attention on the need to prepare the British Armed Forces for state conflict against a peer adversary in Europe. This marks a significant change in emphasis for forces that have become optimised for operations further afield, beyond the core NATO area. Force design choices need to respond to this shift in thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle for Ukraine has shifted the military spotlight back to the critical issue of army mass, in several dimensions: numbers of deployable manoeuvre formations; the quantities of infantry (thickened with anti-armour and anti-air components) required to protect long lines of communications for deployed formations; and the number of engineers needed to keep these lines open. There are also the challenging manpower requirements for guarding vulnerable civilian populations and assets far from the fighting. The Ukraine conflict reminds us of the endless manpower required in urban warfare to rotate exhausted troops. In the air, superior numbers of Russian aircraft have had an impact, but neither side has managed to establish air superiority, enabling drones to disrupt the equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has prepared for this war since 2014, having to balance the cost of developing effective defence forces with the need to grow the country’s economy. This has meant a small but highly capable regular army, with reserve forces providing both ground-holding mass – including in Mariupol, where a National Guard unit, the Azov Regiment, was the last force standing – and a second echelon for most force types, including infantry and artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Russia has emphasised greater professionalisation, de-emphasising its reserves and conscripts, and has focused on modernising its equipment. Russia’s combat formations have shrunk into small but complex and unwieldy battalion tactical groups so understaffed that they have been unable to train or fight as they should; its fleet does not dare close with the Ukrainian coast, and its air force often operates in tactically unsound single sorties. Initially, President Vladimir Putin was reluctant to mobilise and deploy many of his 2 million mostly ex-conscript reservists (almost his only source of fresh personnel), including as replacements for officers, who have died in considerable numbers. This left a tired army with no means of rotating fought-out units, although Putin has announced plans to increase the size of the Russian armed forces, including 137,000 additional combat troops. He has, however, now acknowledged the challenges his army faces and agreed to a partial mobilisation. Whether this will be enough to replace his losses and allow exhausted units some relief and the opportunity to reconstitute remains to be seen. The public reaction, as losses continue, will be an important factor in determining his confidence in mobilising further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Armed Forces have been reduced in size since 1990 and are now substantially smaller than those that faced a threatening Soviet Union during the Cold War. The reduction in the regular forces has been accompanied by a commitment to the Army Reserve, including in the Integrated Review. A major study, the Reserve Forces Review 2030 (RF30), was commissioned as an opportunity to address some of the issues with the Reserve as the geo-strategic environment moved from expeditionary operations – addressed in a previous report entitled Future Reserves 2020 (FR20) – to a focus on state-based threats within an era of ‘great power competition’. While providing a helpful framing of what the Reserve could do, and highlighting critical personnel, operational and cultural matters, RF30 was written before the Russian invasion of Ukraine and thus does not provide a full blueprint for resetting the Reserve component in light of the current threat. So far it has not attracted a formal response from the UK government, which we must hope is because the lessons from the illegal invasion of Ukraine are being evaluated and will lead to clearer direction for the Reserve. The lack of a response may, however, be because the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is unable to properly direct and hold the single services to account on capability matters – almost all of the military advisers to ministers are regular officers, and regular staff may, consciously or unconsciously, seek to protect their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Future Soldier’, the British Army’s published blueprint on the future of its forces, outlines an expanded role for the Army Reserve, although the Reserve’s shape is still under consideration and, worryingly, the blueprint includes a 10% reduction in its trained strength. The government has, however, stated that ‘[t]hese figures are subject to change pending any potential future TLB [top-level budget] review’. The RAF has announced an intention to double its (albeit small) reserves to 5,000, but firm plans for delivering on this are not yet available. Strategic Command is looking to expand its use of reservists, not least in cyber. The Royal Navy’s plans for the Royal Naval Reserve and Royal Marines Reserve, which are also small, have not yet emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Churchill’s observation that ‘[t]he farther back you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see’, this paper examines lessons from history and recent operations on how large-scale mobilisation has operated, using reserves and other means to achieve mass, and does so in comparison with the UK’s closest allies. There are important issues across all the services, but this paper aims to illustrate the limitations of the current approach to the Army Reserve and suggests improvements through comparison with the UK’s principal Five Eyes partners – the US, Australia and Canada – and reference to historical examples. Reserves exist primarily to provide mass in war while being affordable in peacetime, but they have two other roles: maintaining links between the regular armed forces and wider society; and access to specialist skills from civilian life, from medical training to emergent technologies. Ukraine reminds us that whole nations fight successful wars at scale, not just professional armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main factors which make the UK’s three principal Five Eyes partners the most relevant comparators. First, all four countries share an expeditionary model; in contrast, the proximity of many of the UK’s Northern and Eastern European allies on Russia leads them to focus on the direct threat of invasion. For example, Finland and Norway both have reserve forces much larger than their regular forces, and many Eastern European countries are expanding their reserves (though their position is clearly different). Second, the UK’s nearest neighbour and comparator, France (along with Italy), has a large-scale Gendarmerie, cross-trained as soldiers, including light armoured special forces and other specialist elements. These are full-time police officers, but in war and homeland emergencies they supplement the regular armed forces. The UK is unlikely to adopt this approach. Third, most of the UK’s continental allies used conscription a generation ago, and some, including Germany (which has nevertheless indicated an intention to substantially expand its volunteer reserves), used conscription much more recently. In contrast, apart from comparatively short periods of National Service in the UK after the Second World War and in the US during the Korean and Vietnam Wars, none of the Five Eyes countries has operated conscription at scale outside the envelope of a world war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study is evidence-based. It has drawn heavily on the author’s experience as a reservist and as a minister, and on his extensive visits to reserve units in the UK, in the Five Eyes countries and on operations over many years. It is confined to the British Army volunteer reserves; the case for updating arrangements for individual ex-regular reservists is well made elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is composed of three chapters. Chapter I offers an evaluation of the current state of the British Army Reserve, citing comparisons with relevant international partners. Chapter II provides an analysis of a series of campaigns, examining how structures in peacetime, when resources were necessarily limited, enabled – or otherwise – large-scale expansion in war and how successful were the non-regular forces concerned, especially in the crucial early stages of war. The focus on early stages reflects the fact that during major wars of significant duration the elements blur, but pre-existing reserve structures help to determine what mass is available, and at what standard. The paper also argues that some characteristics of reserve soldiering, if carried on during such wars, can help to promote esprit de corps. Chapter III proposes a model for the British Army Reserve that responds to the current threat and to historical lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;size-and-laydown&quot;&gt;Size and Laydown&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The composition of the British Army Reserve is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/n7pzJDb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: British Army Reserve as at 1 January 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/quarterly-service-personnel-statistics-2022/quarterly-service-personnel-statistics-1-january-2022#future-reserves-2020-fr20-programme-monitoring&quot;&gt;MoD, ‘Quarterly Service Personnel Statistics 1 January 2022’, 2 September 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trained strength figure in Table 1 includes those who have completed initial basic (Phase 1) training but not their initial trade (Phase 2) training. It also includes many soldiers who have not trained for a year, partly as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic. It is difficult to get a completely accurate picture of the readiness of the Army Reserve, as measures of individual readiness are not regularly published. When not mobilised, Army Reserve forces (including the costs of equipment, infrastructure, training, etc.) cost roughly one-fifth as much as their regular counterparts, making them an attractive option for providing mass in war, and more affordable in peacetime. Despite this, one of the most obvious differences between the reserve forces of the major Five Eyes countries today is in proportionate size, as illustrated in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second difference between the UK and its sister countries relates to laydown. Most reserve units in the US, Canada and Australia are in geographically concentrated brigades, whereas in the UK brigades are often scattered around the country, with even individual units sometimes spread across regions. The UK also has a complicated split between operational and regional command, creating a ‘warlords and landlords’ scenario. All this generates time-consuming complexity when, in reserve matters, time is already stretched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-progress&quot;&gt;Areas of Progress&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been useful progress in five areas since the FR20 report painted its dismal picture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Officer recruitment: By 2011, the smallest reserve course at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (RMAS) had only seven officers, and none of the courses had more than about 30. Recently, summer courses have typically attracted 100 (the maximum). Nevertheless, the number of young officers remains a serious problem across many units, but quantifying this is difficult as the MoD has stopped counting reserve officers separately in its quarterly statistics – although it continues to do so for regulars.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Representation: Genuine reservists – that is, people who have extensive experience combining a civilian job with reserve service – are better represented in the upper echelons of the service. When the FR20 survey was commissioned, the only reserve two-star post was the tri-service post of assistant chief of the defence staff (reserves and cadets). Today there is a major general on the Army Board and a second one as deputy commander field army, and the number of reserve brigadiers has doubled, although senior reserve representation in the crucial area of RMAS has been diminished and the total count is still proportionately smaller than that of the other Five Eyes countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terms and conditions: Terms and conditions of service have improved, with pensions introduced and provision for physiotherapy for those suffering injuries during training. There is room for improvement, notably in relation to wider medical access, but the situation is less dire than in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognition: The establishment of the Armed Forces Covenant and gold, silver and bronze awards for employers has made many organisations more reserve-friendly, although in some cases the policy has not trickled down to the working level. Sadly, advances in this area do not seem to be matched by MoD understanding of employers’ reasonable needs on mobilisation, as we shall see below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integration: The unit pairing mechanism has enabled better relationships and mutual support between regular and reserve components. Pairing is reliant on personalities, reasonable proximity geographically, and on having a high commonality of role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many other respects, however, the picture is bleak, and the emerging outline plans do not seem to be based on a comprehensive understanding of the Army Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recruitment&quot;&gt;Recruitment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pandemic hit the Reserve hard, but this was exacerbated by the Army abandoning reserve recruiting and cancelling many induction weekends in 2021 to allow it to focus on regulars. The breakdown in the online recruiting system (the Defence Recruitment System) and the inadequacies of the paper alternative are widely known, but they came on top of a situation in which delays of up to a whole year were not uncommon. It takes a highly motivated recruit to continue to wait. This has been compounded by the decision, taken in order to reduce risk, to slow the pace of Phase 1 training for the Reserve, which has led, anecdotal evidence suggests, to a substantial increase in wastage – although official figures are not available. The modest attempt in autumn 2021 to relaunch reserve recruitment was, astonishingly, carried out without any coordination with units themselves or the Reserve Forces’ and Cadets’ Associations (RFCA), which provides links to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new contract is being let for Army recruiting – a sensible move after all the failures of the current system. The previous contract was established with little regard for reservists, yet recruiting of reserves was handed over at the same time, and it took years to adjust it to operate even passably well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unit-structure&quot;&gt;Unit Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build and maintain a healthy volunteer unit, a vicious circle has to be broken. Soldiers are motivated by challenging training, but to deliver interesting collective training, numbers are needed. The vital ground in this is ‘critical mass’ – getting enough soldiers together in a particular training period for realistic training to become viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, reserve units were large enough to provide this ability to train en masse, but nowadays reserve units are much smaller. Although regular units have also shrunk, a reserve unit’s establishment includes soldiers who have not passed Phase 2 training and so cannot participate in all activities. To take an example, a reserve infantry battalion’s establishment has in recent times largely mirrored a regular one, at 440 people, with rifle companies at nominally 100. But even when up to strength (and, post-COVID, few are), reservists’ other commitments mean that turnout on any one weekend will never be 100%. Moreover, soldiers who have not completed their Phase 2 training cannot fully participate but are still included in the total. The result can swiftly become a cycle of small turnouts leading to an inability to conduct realistic training, in turn leading to fewer people attending training and ultimately to falling retention levels (and readiness and operational capability). Despite this, a new proposal calls for further cuts in reserve unit establishments to meet the 10% cut in overall Army Reserve numbers. Worse, in the case of the infantry the bulk of the cuts (if confirmed) are in support weapons, including two-thirds of anti-tank weapons and mortars – ironically one of the few areas in which the reserves are well equipped. The last time the main threat stemmed from Russia, the Territorial Army (TA) provided potent and validated blocking units equipped with anti-tank missiles (more difficult to operate than today’s, which can be trained quickly), and mortars that have not physically changed in decades. The US, Canada and Australia all have a full suite of mortars and anti-tank weapons within their reserve orders of battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new proposal – set against the background of the Ukraine war – sends a message to reserve infantry units that they are not taken seriously for warfighting, except to backfill regular units. The focus on backfilling regular units has had a devastating impact on the reserve officer corps, which is discussed later in the section on Afghanistan. The proposal threatens to take the Army Reserve back to the position it was in at the time of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review that resulted in a need to reset the approach under the FR20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consideration has been given to creating further hybrid units in specialist areas comprising both regular and reserve soldiers. This is unwise: earlier experiments with hybrid brigades in the 1990s were unsuccessful. In Australia, regulars made up 20% of the 7 th Brigade in Brisbane, while in Canada, regulars comprised 10% of the Reserve Brigade in British Columbia. The UK has had more recent hybrid arrangements, including amalgamating regular and reserve Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiments into two hybrid regiments. Australia and Canada have ‘de-hybridised’, and the UK has largely done the same. The US National Guard eschews hybrid units except for a few small, specialist pools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons why hybrid units have failed are various. Regular soldiers with busy military commitments, who are often away from their families, were expected to work evenings and weekends with reservists. For the Reserve, there was a collapse in officer numbers stemming from a lack of understanding of how the volunteer leadership ethos fits around civilian jobs – although good regular commanding officers can make a bad system work for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;individual-training&quot;&gt;Individual Training&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, most individual training was delivered within units, but this function has recently become much more centralised. This can ensure uniform standards and allows access to equipment that is too expensive to be available across many locations, but taking soldiers away from their units works against critical mass and undermines unit cohesion. This is particularly noticeable in basic training. The organisations which deliver Phase 1 training seem to regard training itself as the sole aim, ignoring the importance of building ties of comradeship. Many follow the practice of mixing soldiers from different units across platoons so that precious formative experiences are not shared with future comrades. (In the US National Guard, units can specify that their recruits are kept together.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friendships and fellow feeling do much to bring a soldier in on a parade night after a hard week at work – and it was the ties of comradeship that built British soldiers’ spirit in earlier conflicts. Because regular soldiers live and work in their units, they seldom understand how much harder it is to develop comradeship in a reserve unit. The very few units which do carry out their own basic training, principally the Honourable Artillery Company and 4th Battalion, Parachute Regiment, are strong on retaining those who complete the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a wider problem with UK training, which is a theme in the RF30 report and has repeatedly been raised by the CRFCA External Scrutiny Team (EST): failing to optimise the time of soldiers with busy day jobs, rather than simply defaulting to sending them on regular courses, matching civilian working hours at distant establishments. After all, reservists are required to have higher educational attainment than regulars precisely to allow accelerated learning, which would suit both their capacity and their available time. The temptation to demand that a reservist must achieve full regular equivalence in order to be regarded as safe or competent has proven difficult to resist for some. Given the limited time that a reservist can devote to the Army, for those in areas for which there is no civilian comparator, such as infantry, this runs the risk of them doing a little of everything and being good at nothing. It is better to narrow the aperture and be good at a subset of activities, and to have a predetermined plan for how to train for the rest on mobilisation. That training must not only fit within the time available, but must also be engaging. It should be demanding and hard if it is to be rewarding and retain the right soldiers, not pedestrian and box-ticking, which it can be today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some parts of the Army understand this. The EST notes that some arms schools, notably Chatham and Larkhill, have found ways of modularising training and devolving elements to units on an accredited basis. Distance learning has expanded. Unfortunately, some corps remain behind the curve, with Bovington and Leconfield notorious for making civilians duplicate, at a snail’s pace, driving skills that they already – at least in part – possess (two weeks for a reservist with a driving licence to drive a Land Rover). Given the effort that the Army has spent on accrediting its courses to allow regular personnel to achieve civilian qualifications, it is surprising that it does not always see the value in directly recognising civilian qualifications and offering shorter military conversion courses where necessary. This would maximise the potential in the reserves that is currently untapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Australians use competency-based training in some areas, cutting through the above issues of decentralisation and civilian skill recognition. The principle is that, where appropriate, the soldier can take the test without doing the course. This allows an impartial assessment of their skills, whether learned at the military school, in the unit or in civilian life. Competency-based training is not a universal panacea, and it still requires military schools to modularise so that reservists can take the test at the appropriate stage. The Canadian approach is simply to modularise and allow a higher proportion of courses to be delivered in-unit, accredited by training schools. Time at the arms schools is critical in establishing the ethos of the corps concerned, but this does not mean that all parts of the courses should be delivered there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;officer-training&quot;&gt;Officer Training&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RMAS has a good system, with four two-week packages that can be delivered either as one eight-week period (ideal for students), or separately. The first two are also available in University Officers’ Training Corps (UOTCs). After that, however, the UK’s officer training lags behind that of its comparators. The quality and shape of Phase 2 training varies across the arms schools, with Chatham and Larkhill arguably performing best for officers as well, but no other Anglophone country spends so little time on officer Phase 2 training. This partly reflects the higher proportion of students recruited as officers and other ranks in the UK’s sister countries. Many US states fund generous fee waivers to encourage students to join the National Guard, but, while published figures are hard to find, visits by the author to Australian and Canadian reserves found large numbers of students across a range of units and ranks, without any such incentives. Students are ‘time rich and cash poor’, but in the UK, Phase 2 training often occurs during term time, failing to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On promotion to major, regular officers attend the Intermediate Command and Staff Course (Land Reserves) before fulfilling sub-unit command or staff roles, learning about fighting formations, UK resilience, and command and staff skills, with some global context and management of the Army. For reservists, the 26-week Regular course is pared down to a series of weekends and a fortnight’s residential module, and reservists often complete it while fulfilling their Reserve appointment. This very short course, combined with a demanding role commanding a sub-unit, often intersects with the attendee having both a young family and a busy civilian career, leading to heavy pressure on the individual and – arguably – a poor template for learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On promotion to lieutenant colonel, Army reservists join their Air and Maritime colleagues on the Advanced Command and Staff Course (Reserves) (ACSC(R)). This delivers a taste of the Regular ACSC (which lasts an academic year) in a single fortnight, with a preparatory weekend and some additional learning in between. It supposedly involves developing an intellectual edge and an understanding of military, political and international issues for a reserve cohort that will almost exclusively spend the rest of their careers in single services roles. As a reservist should in any event be bringing alternative perspectives and critical thinking from their civilian career, this may not be an optimal use of their time. No Staff College reserve directing staff teaching posts exist; instead, reserve staff courses rely on ad hoc arrangements to borrow staff. Besides raising quality issues, this means the Reserve has no opportunity to use the ACSC to develop its rising stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, all three of the UK’s comparators offer the ‘extended period out’ approach for staff college training, although the arrangements vary (as do those for their regular officers). For example, a Canadian regular or reserve officer can do a distance learning alternative to the 10-month residential Joint Command and Staff Programme in two one-year modules, using weekends, remote work and an annual fortnight; this can cover the whole regular course or just the first module, which itself provides a valuable experience. This seems a much better approach, offering concentrated, rigorous learning without compromising unit service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mobilisation&quot;&gt;Mobilisation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RF30 quotes an Army Reserve commanding officer as saying, ‘I have found mobilisation to be poorly understood by almost ‘everybody… Readiness is largely a paperwork exercise’. The report goes on to make extensive recommendations to improve mobilisation arrangements, noting that Exercise Agile Stance is designed to address mobilisation problems. The EST observed in its last two reports that mobilisation arrangements did not work well for pandemic support (Operation Rescript), attributing this to ‘limited expertise or corporate memory in the MOD (Security Policy and Operations (SPO)) – the MOD’s operations cell – Standing Joint Command (SJC) HQ and Land Operations Centre (LOC)’. It is not yet clear whether Agile Stance will address this deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many reservists came forward to volunteer under Operation Rescript, soldiers were often stood up and stood down again, creating issues for reserves with their families and civilian employers. Liaison with employers, whose attitudes were mostly generous, was weak, despite the Defence Relationship Management staff (operating under the wing of the RFCAs) working hard to bolster goodwill with awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;equipment&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Units can only be credible if they have the right equipment. Take armour as an example. The armoured brigades in the US National Guard have the same scale as their regular counterparts. In Canada and Australia, reserves have only armoured recce, but both have the number of light armoured vehicles they need to train effectively: Textron Tactical Armoured Patrol Vehicles in Canada, Bushmasters in Australia. The UK has a single regiment to provide reserve Challenger tank crews, which is reliant on its regular counterparts for borrowing armour. Proximity allows this to work reasonably well, but the UK’s three reserve armoured reconnaissance regiments are each equipped only with eight well-used Jackal vehicles each, averaging less than two vehicles per squadron. The squadrons are a long way apart and, lacking a budget for low-loaders, vehicles can only be concentrated for squadron training by further wearing them out on long journeys – and misemploying busy staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is compounded by an issue which applies across the Army Reserve. A decade ago, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers detachments were withdrawn and concentrated. The CRFCA EST has repeatedly reported on the damaging effect that this has had on vehicle maintenance and availability. The Army has not restored the arrangement, despite the impact on Army Reserve capability (and the absence of obvious cost implications).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal equipment is also important to both quality of training and morale. In the 1980s, a TA soldier in combat dress was indistinguishable from a regular. Today, the former is more likely to have older pattern webbing, body armour and weapon modification standards, giving the impression that reserves are not valued. Similarly, a reservist working on an overseas exercise will not usually be eligible for the same allowances for deployment as a regular, nor even the same protections in case of injury. While perhaps small in absolute terms, the impact is significant and profound for volunteers who join in the hope of ‘belonging’ to the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;buildings&quot;&gt;Buildings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reserve units to thrive, they need to operate from good-quality buildings that are practical, secure and provide an atmosphere conducive to training and social events. Some units have such facilities, but some sites are in a terrible state. This has recently been compounded by the failure of the Army to replace caretakers as they retire. Furthermore, whereas in the past the RFCAs had great independence in managing the sites, they do not enjoy the same delegated powers as the Army has for – usually far more expensive – regular sites. Given that the RFCAs can often draw on a wide range of pro-bono expertise in areas from estate management to accountancy, marketing and law, the disenfranchising of the RFCAs is depriving Defence of the value they can bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some progress since the FR20 report, serious challenges remain if the value of the Army Reserve is to be harnessed to greatest effect, and if the Reserve is to be able to respond to the heightened threats that the UK currently faces. These challenges include how the reserves are configured, recruited, regulated, rewarded and supported. History offers some lessons for how these issues might be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-mobilisation-and-reserves-in-history-and-recent-operations&quot;&gt;II. Mobilisation and Reserves in History and Recent Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of the UK and its major Five Eyes allies offers some important lessons into how the Army Reserve can be used effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;first-world-war-reserve-cohesion&quot;&gt;First World War: Reserve Cohesion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1908, Richard (later Lord) Haldane introduced the plan laying the foundations for Britain’s subsequent war effort. It envisaged six regular divisions, backed by 14 territorial ones. When war broke out, the then newly appointed secretary of state for war, Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, announced that he ‘could take no account of any but regular soldiers’ and started raising general service divisions known as ‘Kitchener divisions’. Parliament effectively overruled him, and the Territorial Force was called out, with six territorial divisions following the six regular ones to France and Belgium. More territorial formations were sent to various overseas locations (including Egypt and India) early in the war, in order to release regular forces, and several territorial divisions fought at Gallipoli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Territorials were raised locally, and the ‘Pledge’ – that those raised and trained together would be kept together – was applied for most of the war, despite a series of attempts to undermine it by the War Office. In practice, heavily influenced by Parliament and the county associations, many of the Kitchener divisions developed in a similar fashion. A key ‘characteristic of the New Armies [was] their social cohesion, which gave them their own distinctive esprit de corps. This was partly the result of the [regional] manner in which they were raised, from which many units derived a powerful sense of local identity … [T]he men ate, slept and worked in the sections and platoons in which they were to fight in France and elsewhere’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir John French, commander of the British Expeditionary Force, asserted that ‘without the assistance which the Territorials afforded between October 1914 and June 1915, it would have been impossible to hold the line in France and Belgium’. As Kitchener divisions came up to speed, the three elements of the Army – Regular, Territorial and General Service – operated in parallel. Dominic Graham comments: ‘That [the British Army] fought as well as it did in 1915 and 1916, when its regular cadre had been virtually destroyed in the opening months of the war, is remarkable. That it ended the war in 1918 as the most effective force on the Western Front is astonishing.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dominions – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa – had tiny regular forces at the outbreak of the war, but substantial citizen forces. These were deployed under a range of different models, but each was locally raised, and they stressed unit cohesion. In the final breakout for the Hundred Days Offensive, at the Battle of Amiens, of the three infantry corps in the Army selected to lead the attack, one was Canadian and another Australian. 50 The Canadian corps was commanded by Sir Arthur Currie, an estate agent, and the Australian corps by Sir John Monash, a civil engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;second-world-war-understanding-the-reserves&quot;&gt;Second World War: Understanding the Reserves&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the First World War it was agreed that the Territorial Army (as it was now known) should take the full role of providing follow-on formations in any future conflict. Despite this, the Territorials were reduced in number and so poorly resourced that, for many, training virtually ceased. In early 1939 the decision was taken to double the size of the TA, but this was implemented in a haphazard fashion. Instead of allowing existing units to prepare for war and then reallocating their training staff to build up the next tier, in many cases units were simply broken in half and backfilled with – often unwilling – conscripts, presumably in the belief that this would be quicker. The Pledge on unit integrity was abandoned, and overall effectiveness suffered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, eight of the 13 British Expeditionary Force divisions deployed to France were reserve divisions – and three of them were selected for the final stand on the Dunkirk perimeter as the rest of the Army evacuated. One, the 46th Division, only deployed with light weapons for pioneer duties, yet that perimeter held. The early defence of Calais was conducted by a single Rifle territorial battalion until its two regular sister battalions arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, for the first half of the war the UK’s armies were driven back in every campaign around the world, sometimes, as in North Africa and Malaya, by smaller enemy forces. The Narvik campaign provides an illustration of how the ‘pick-and-mix’ muddle in manning – in contrast to the careful honing of unit cohesion and spirit in the First World War – undermined performance. Some units had barely even paraded together before getting on the ships, let alone honed the links of comradeship over years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the First World War, each dominion’s model for its citizen forces was different, but they retained the same broad approach, with an emphasis on units with strong cohesion based on local links. And the strong performance of the dominion reserve units is illustrated by the fact that the division which stopped Rommel’s Africa Korps as he swept the 8th Army eastward in 1941 was the Australian 9th Division, commanded by schoolteacher Major General Leslie Morshead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two most successful theatre commanders, Montgomery and Slim, despite sharply contrasting characters, both recognised the differences in style and approach needed for leadership of citizen soldiers. Slim, whose astonishing achievements in Burma are widely recognised, was a pre-First World War territorial who did his officer training at Birmingham UOTC. Montgomery commented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Britain goes to war the ranks of her armed forces are filled with men from civil life who are not soldiers, sailors, or airmen by profession: and who never wanted to be … [The citizen soldier] can think, he can appreciate, and he is definitely prepared to criticise. He wants to know what is going on, and what you want him to do – and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characteristically, Montgomery claimed this as his own (and modern) insight. In fact, George Washington’s inspector of his eclectic civilian army commented in a letter to a fellow professional two centuries earlier: ‘You say to your soldier “Do this[”,] and he doeth it … ; but I am obliged to say [to the American citizen soldier]: “This is the reason why you ought to do that[”,] and then he does it.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of Montgomery’s divisions showed early excellence. The Australian 9th Division near Tobruk was an inexperienced citizen formation that was commanded by Morshead. It had arrived only two weeks earlier, without heavy weapons, and had equipped itself from a captured Italian armoury. Despite these unpromising circumstances, the Australians held the Africa Korps at Tobruk. The 51st Highland Division was grouped with the 9th and the New Zealand Division, spearheading the breakout at El Alamein. Its (regular) commander General Douglas Wimberley had gone to extraordinary lengths to emphasise divisional identity – he ‘made every single one of them believe that he was a Highlander, whatever his birth certificate said to the contrary’. However, unit performance declined sharply when he handed over to a successor less interested in unit identity. The transfer occurred against a background of lingering resentment from the Salerno mutiny, which occurred when dozens of the unit’s soldiers were posted to other divisions after recovering from wounds. The importance of unit cohesion is clear. In the Second World War the dominions seemed to be better at understanding citizen soldiers – almost all their senior commanders in both world wars were from their militias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RAF’s reserves make an interesting comparison to those of the Army, with the former showing consistent excellence even from the beginning of the war. Unlike many in the interwar Army, the RAF’s Lord Trenchard was a passionate believer in the importance of civilian volunteer units. He established the Auxiliary Air Force (AAF) in 1925, ‘as a corps d’elite … Esprit de corps was to be the dominating force in the squadrons and each, therefore was to have a well-equipped HQ, mess and life of its own’. AAF squadrons shot down the first German bombers of the war, provided 14 squadrons in the Battle of Britain and accounted for the first V1 kill. An AAF squadron was also selected to be the first to fly jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Britain, the US had a long tradition of the militia providing a large element of the fighting capability in all its wars, including the American Revolution, the Mexican War, the Civil War and the Spanish War. The US started the Second World War with a National Guard 18 divisions strong, which provided a large part of the US Army’s initial deployed strength (its regular army was much smaller). However, the National Guard suffered from some of the same problems as its UK counterpart, feeling less favoured for resourcing in interwar years and being backfilled with conscripts on mobilisation. Nevertheless, these were forces whose original members had trained together and shared geographic roots. Some of the US Army’s greatest achievements were by National Guard units, including many of the valiant defenders of the Bataan peninsula at the beginning of the Pacific War and, later, one of the two regimental combat teams that secured Omaha Beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One element of the US Army with a strong sense of unit integrity were the airborne forces, which were overwhelmingly composed of wartime citizen volunteers. The ‘Band of Brothers’ concept was rigorously enforced, with soldiers always serving alongside those they had trained with. As with the British TA, the National Guard was not allowed to train recruits separately once the war had started, and the casualty re-posting policy (which theoretically did apply to all US soldiers) was more rigorously applied in the airborne forces, where recovered casualties were always restored to their own units. Elite, all-volunteer units can be expected to perform highly, but the astonishing events during the Battle of the Bulge provide another stark comparison of the two approaches. US paratroopers, without heavy weapons or winter clothing, advanced through lines of fleeing US soldiers, picking up the kit that the latter had abandoned, and went on to halt Hitler’s last major western offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further interesting case study is the extraordinary performance of the US Marine Corps in the Second World War. It is widely noted that the Marine Corps expanded more than 30-fold during the war, from 15,000 active duty members to nearly half a million, while remaining an exceptionally high-quality force. These figures, however, disguise the efforts of successive commandants from 1925 onward to build capability and mass in their reserves, despite pitifully low funding. The Reserve was greatly expanded by the 1938 Naval Reserve Act (still two years ahead of funding and mobilisation measures across the US Armed Forces); 70% of all US Marines serving in the Second World War came through the Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vietnam-a-breach-between-the-armed-forces-and-society&quot;&gt;Vietnam: A Breach Between the Armed Forces and Society&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vietnam War was the first and only time in US history that the country’s armed forces fought at scale with no substantial militia element. As the war developed, the National Guard Association lobbied the president to keep the Guard out of it, on the basis that there was insufficient popular support to justify sending citizen soldiers. Instead of seeing this as a serious problem, the Pentagon acquiesced, brushing aside the civilian, political and social fabric into which the militia was woven and mobilised by conscription into the active Army. The forces deployed had an entirely regular spine, with every senior and middle-ranking army officer a regular, as there was no alternative pathway. Serving under these officers was a mass of conscript manpower, thrust in with no respect for geography, who were trained centrally and typically deployed as individuals – a toxic combination even before considering the deeply felt political and popular opposition to the war. Once it became apparent that the National Guard would not be called upon, it became a haven to avoid conscription, compounding the collapse in domestic support for the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this experience came the Abrams Doctrine – the foundation for rebuilding the relationship between the US Armed Forces and the people, with the National Guard and Reserves at its heart. ‘They are not taking us to war again without calling up reserves’ became a key lesson. The object was not merely efficiency but forging and maintaining a bond with the American people. We see the obverse of this in Russia, where Putin’s need to maintain his popular base made him reluctant for so long to call out reserves for his so-called ‘special operation’ in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wider point applies here. British officers often comment enviously on the better relationship between the US Armed Forces and the civilian public than exists in the UK. Yet, after Vietnam, that relationship had become so toxic that many universities had closed down their Reserve Officers’ Training Corps and banned uniforms on their campuses. The current relationship was painfully rebuilt, and the National Guard – with its presence in every major population centre and its very public state-based role in disaster relief – was at the heart of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iraq-200311-mobilisation-problems-in-the-uk&quot;&gt;Iraq 2003–11: Mobilisation Problems in the UK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of the 2003 Iraq War, the US used reserves extensively, with regulars providing the bulk of the manoeuvre forces and the National Guard holding ground. The National and Air Guard alone provided over a quarter of a million deployed soldiers and airmen, while simultaneously deploying to Afghanistan and handling domestic crises including Hurricane Katrina. This was a remarkable example of all three main purposes of reserves: the availability of affordable mass; the tying in of public opinion through citizen-led deployments (unlike in Vietnam); and the usefulness of many of the specialist skills brought by the National Guard from civilian life – farmers, local government officials and police officers were able to assist in rebuilding the shattered local economy and social fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas the US reserves were roughly two-fifths of the country’s armed forces, the UK’s were only around one-fifth, yet a huge mobilisation effort was mounted in the latter country too. Former Chief of the Defence Staff, Lord Inge, commented: ‘In conclusion, I pay a huge tribute to the Territorial Army for what it has done and achieved … [T]he equivalent of 19 or 20 infantry battalions deployed on operations is a huge achievement and speaks volumes for their ability, commitment and dedication.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This included formed bodies ranging from a yeomanry unit in a CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) defence role to 131 Commando Squadron Royal Engineers, who made the front page of The Times, getting tanks across the Al-Faw peninsula under fire on D-Day of Operation Telic 1. From the infantry, large numbers of formed companies deployed for force protection duties. The whole of the Royal Naval Reserve Air Branch was mobilised for several months; it was used mostly to release regulars for the frontline, but members of the Air Branch went on to serve there and in Afghanistan. Large numbers of individuals were mobilised across all three services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the reserves had served the UK well, they had been treated shabbily in return. The previous large post-National Service mobilisation – Kosovo – had also been successful in terms of people volunteering, but had also led to widespread criticisms of the MoD’s handling of mobilisation, including notice periods of only a few days, soldiers being mailshotted without their units being informed, soldiers being called out and immediately stood down, and pay sometimes being months in arrears. One major improvement that had taken place between the two campaigns was the introduction of a mobilisation centre at Chilwell (now Bassingbourn), which copes with everything from work-up training for theatre to medical and dental screening. This purpose-designed facility was well run, but the unreasonably short notice periods for many called out for Iraq caused friction even between those most ready to serve and the best employers – a relationship that a reserve has to manage and which is not required of their regular counterpart. Over 200 call-out notices for Iraq were issued at under one week’s notice. Pay problems also continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;afghanistan-200121-the-importance-of-formed-bodies&quot;&gt;Afghanistan 2001–21: The Importance of Formed Bodies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the sacrifices and mobilisation mishaps in Iraq, the UK’s reserves responded well to the call to serve in Afghanistan as the two operations overlapped, heavily stretching the country’s regular forces. A range of formed sub-units was deployed. Brigadier (now Lieutenant General Sir) John Lorimer commented on a company of the Londons that was sent to him for force protection, but which – seeing their quality – he decided to feed into the fighting: ‘Somme Company was an outstanding body of men: well trained, highly motivated and exceptionally well led.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sub-units also deployed from Special Forces, the Yeomanry, the Intelligence Corps and the RAF Regiment, with one unit, 21 Special Air Service (Artists) (Reserve), winning three Military Crosses in a single deployment and a subsequent Conspicuous Gallantry Cross. Yet in 2008 it was decided that subsequent deployments should be by individual augmentees only. This approach, siphoning off junior ranks and leaving officers and non-commissioned officers behind (or offering them administrative jobs), broke the TA’s officer corps. As noted in the FR20 report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The shortfalls in Junior Officer … manning are particularly acute, hampered by under-resourced recruiting and lack of clarity over the TA’s purpose. Satisfaction has been affected by failures to deliver the Reservist Proposition for officers. In particular, the current emphasis on mobilising junior soldier individual augmentees has reduced both command and deployment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contrasted with the successful use of reserves by the Americans. As in Iraq, they formed a major component of the Army, Marine and Air Force presence. The National Guard deployed in brigades but was usually tasked in smaller groups. For example, an infantry regiment which the author visited had most of its platoons defending Provincial Reconstruction Teams along the border with Pakistan, while its HQ and remaining soldiers were responsible for security in US barracks. Overall, the US National Guard and (also part-time volunteer) US Army Reserve made up 45% of all deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australians and Canadians had smaller forces in theatre than the UK, but Australia deployed a formed commando squadron three times and the Canadian force included formed infantry platoons. Canada also had a different approach to augmentation. Reservist junior officers sometimes commanded augmented regular platoons and reserve sergeants commanded gun detachments. This appeared to reinforce the command structure, unlike the impact of a policy of using the reserves in augmentation roles for regular units under regular command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK and allied history is replete with examples of the successful – and unsuccessful – use of reserves in wars and campaigns as a route to mass which is affordable in peacetime. Some of the key lessons we can deduce are: the value of unit cohesion and use in formed bodies both to sustain fighting spirit and to attract quality officers; the importance of commanders understanding the different approach needed to lead citizen soldiers, often best handled by reservist commanders themselves; and the importance of those who organise mobilisation understanding reserves. More widely, we should recognise the value that reserves bring through their civilian skills and their critical role in connecting society more strongly with those who do its defending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-rebuilding-the-army-reserve-for-the-21st-century&quot;&gt;III. Rebuilding the Army Reserve for the 21st Century&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat landscape in the UK has shifted from a broadly defined global one to a much greater focus on Russia, although the (Army) ‘expeditionary concept’ was, for almost all of Britain’s history before 1990, focused on Europe. Even as an imperial power, planning for and mounting large-scale armies was aimed at the continent, except in the brief interval from the Seven Years War to the American Revolution. The UK needs mass again, as it did in the Cold War, and in land forces at least the extreme cost of regular personnel points to holding contingent mass in the reserve forces as the only affordable solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wars make their own demands. Peer-to-peer warfare brings the need to arrive fast and hard with a proportion of the force and then expand and sustain operations better than the adversary. Financial pragmatism and a desire to give the British people a good standard of living means that the UK will probably always have a small regular force, and its island status points to naval (and air) priority. That regular force must be capable of delivering the first strike largely on its own, thus buying time to bring up the supporting elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build mass and sustain combat, reserves are best placed to either deploy rapidly into defined roles – such as anti-tank defence, as practised in the Cold War – or, with a slight delay for training, into wider use to provide follow-on formations as regular ones are degraded or exhausted. The pledge of more money for Defence in the wake of Liz Truss’s arrival as prime minister should, in the Army’s case, be focused on upgrading equipment across land forces and expanding the reserves. A few thousand extra regulars will not alone provide the mass for the follow-on formations that may be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the budget for reserves was absorbed into that of their regular counterparts a generation ago, as part of abandoning the Haldane model, regular officers have been able to raid reserve budgets, often seeing reserves simply as competitors for resources rather than as their own framework for expansion. The decision to cut reserve numbers at the same time as a cut in regular numbers seems to confirm this. The latest EST report has suggested ringfenced funding for mobilising reserves. The case for going further is that the two most successful structures for long-term governance for reserves – the Haldane model and the arrangements for the US National Guard – both stress differentiation as the key to a successful reserve component, from separate funding arrangements to separate sites. This is in sharp contrast to those who argue today that we should even assimilate the governing legislation. Yet the National Guard is arguably the best-integrated reserve in the Anglophone world, working – in formed bodies – alongside regular counterparts worldwide. It is therefore proposed that the UK restore a separate budget to the Army Reserve, with the director of Army reserves as budget holder. This budget should include provision for equipment and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comparisons given in Chapter I and the historical and more recent assessments in Chapter II have illustrated that the organisation of reserves in peacetime is critical to their performance in the early stages of war. When committed to operations, the aims for reserve forces must reflect those of their regular counterparts, but the worst way to integrate two very different components towards those shared goals is to pretend that both components are the same. The UK needs to provide structures, training and processes that lead to civilians serving in formations with the spirit that comes from hard-won unit cohesion – and with a leadership ethos which respects the fact that reservists’ main focus is on their civilian jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again and again, though, we have seen that where the structures and processes are driven by regular staffs they are unable to accommodate the differences between regulars and reserves; a historic example is the contrast between the rapid deployment of highly effective fighting divisions in the First World War – recruited, managed and even funded through County Associations – and the muddle and confusion of the process in 1939 – organised almost exclusively by regular staffs. The latter surely contributed to the subsequent defeats almost everywhere on land in the first half of the Second World War. The higher performance of some of the dominion divisions in the Second World War (recruited, shaped and commanded by reserve officers, as highlighted above) underlines this point. A more recent example is the persistent failings of even small-scale mobilisation processes in the UK, from Kosovo to the coronavirus pandemic, reported by the House of Commons Defence Committee, RF30 and the CRFCA EST. These contrast with the slick, efficient American arrangements for Iraq and Afghanistan. Another example is the poor quality and slowness of many British reserve training courses, compared with the imaginative approaches framing reserve courses in Australia and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has also abandoned the regional basis for reserve forces which used to be at the heart of the old TA, while all our cousins remain firmly committed to it. The UK likes to think that it invented the regimental system based around regional loyalties, but it is now the only major Five Eyes country that has been forced to confuse and dislocate regional ties in its reserves; fragmented brigades whose units are run by separate ‘warlords’ and ‘landlords’ – the units answer to the former for operational matters and the latter for administrative ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership needs to be delivered by reservists with a range of quality civilian careers developing a shared culture which connects and exchanges ideas from the civilian world, both regionally and nationally. The envelope for reserve peacetime activity must work for people with challenging civilian jobs and should not merely be a string of auxiliary tasks keeping the underemployed busy. This means that unless governance is addressed, the outlook for reserves is likely to remain precarious – a tri-service point, but worth addressing here. As well as the need for separate identifiable budgets ringfenced for reserves referred to above, the reserves should have a three-star officer in the MoD to act as their champion. This individual would have access to ministers and would be appointed by ministers in the way that the current heads of the regular services are, but they would not control either the reserve forces or their budgets – this function would be vested in the single service reserve directors. The holder would provide reserve expertise beyond the People Function (currently provided by the assistant chief of the defence staff (reserves and cadets)) and ensure that the Reserve’s voice is heard in operational, capability planning and resourcing debates. They should also sit on the boards which appoint the single service heads of reserves to ensure that those appointments are held by candidates who genuinely represent the volunteer reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case in the US, separating the budgets would need to be underpinned by legislation. A crucial element would be ensuring that the key post-holders in the MoD hierarchy and the reserves are genuine reservists, with a part-time record and civilian career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above considerations point towards the following broad recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;purpose-and-use&quot;&gt;Purpose and Use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current Army Reserve was developed (sensibly) to support smaller-scale expeditionary operations outside the NATO area, such as in Iraq and Afghanistan. With the return to state competition with Russia and potential conflict in Europe, there is a need to restore the centrality of reserve units and formations to provide follow-on forces and mass.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given their local knowledge, reserves have a critical role to play in home defence (for example, against enemy special forces) and resilience work, but availability for these roles comes as a bonus with good-quality units. Making resilience the main focus does not attract talent, whereas warfighting roles in formed bodies, and the realistic training which accompanies them, does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;numbers-and-shape&quot;&gt;Numbers and Shape&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK should increase the size of its Army Reserve towards the Anglophone average of approximately 80% of the size of the regular Army, ideally reversing the planned cut to current regular Army numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The regular Army should focus on providing higher-readiness units and formations, with reserves providing much of the next wave. A few reserve units should also have high-readiness responsibilities, as the 4th Battalion, Parachute Regiment does now, although there should be a greater emphasis on the ability to deploy as formed units.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The doctrine of promoting unit cohesion should permeate all aspects of the reserves, including operational deployments. Units should be larger so that they can be deployed as units in general war. Consequently, their establishments should be increased, including adequate administrative support. Support weapons, and platoons with their own officers and permanent staff (so they can train independently) are at the heart of the credibility of reserve infantry units. Forming extra sub-units inside existing combat, combat support and command support reserve units is highly cost-effective too, as it saves on expensive overheads and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The announcement of the reforming of a reserve brigade (the 19th Brigade) under a reservist should be welcome news, but the decision to include units from every corner of the country runs against all successful practice in the UK’s Anglophone sister countries and makes life almost impossible for any commander with a proper civilian job. A span of command of nearly a dozen units is also probably unworkable. Instead, the UK should imitate other Anglophone countries (and its own past) by restoring territorially based brigades: initially three, with one in each of southern England, northern England and Scotland, each with one of the yeomanry recce units (properly equipped) and some infantry battalions, and with combat support and combat service support. This would be a step towards rekindling the regional and regimental spirit that has particular value for the reserves in recruiting, building comradeship and delivering local support in times of mobilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recruitment-1&quot;&gt;Recruitment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recruitment needs to be streamlined, both to increase the number of applicants and to reduce delays in the system. Reserves must be separately and properly catered for in the new Armed Forces recruiting programme contract currently being negotiated. Recruitment should aim to attract many more students (as other ranks, not just officers), who should be directly recruited on social media, not just via the UOTCs. A significant reduction in delays needs to be achieved through a number of iterative improvements, including changing data laws so that the MoD can directly access the NHS medical documents of applicants (cutting out delays and risk), reducing the number of applicants whose places on courses are cancelled, holding officers controlling the courses directly accountable, and incentivising the new contractor so that speed is a key indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important that officer recruiting and manning is prioritised. The extraordinary (tri-service) decision to downgrade reserve officers in the quarterly manning statistics so they are no longer shown separately from other ranks should be reversed, bringing them back in line with their regular counterparts and allowing proper scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;equipment-1&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reserve units should be equipped and trained for war, but with identified readiness deltas below regulars, and greater specialisation of role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Equipment, which is in desperate need of upgrading across much of the Army Reserve, should be prioritised. While this applies to parts of the regular Army too, the very small sums needed to at least bring personal scales of equipment up to scratch in the Army Reserve and key deficiencies, such as more light armour for yeomanry units, would have a significant impact, and is essential to underpin the ability to deploy reserves as units.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The staffs responsible for devising capability should contain reservists so that opportunities and limitations for reserves are part of the process for equipment development. The UK could specify the need for equipment to be ‘trainable’ in a reserve context during the acquisition process and then see the benefits of innovation driven by commercial competition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers detachments should be restored to reserve units, as repeatedly recommended by the CRFCA EST. This broadly cost-neutral measure would bring greater benefits by improving training, reducing administration, raising morale and improving retention.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;representation&quot;&gt;Representation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides the overarching point on governance made above, reserve officers should also be appointed to the branches identified by the CRFCA EST as failing in the mobilisation process, in both the MoD and the single services, in order to help ensure that the call-out process is appropriate to reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deputy military secretary (reserves) should be given greater powers to control the annual Reserve Service Day ‘ask’ for all reserve posts on behalf of the director of reserves (Army), who is the Army Reserve ‘sponsor’. Currently organisations undermine their own best interests by asking for a time commitment which rules out the best candidates – and when the selected individuals underperform, anti-reserve prejudices are reinforced. Zoom makes a wider set of options possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;training-and-retention&quot;&gt;Training and Retention&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reserve needs more championship within officer training. At RMAS, the post of deputy commandant (reserves) should be restored to one-star rank and given command of the UOTCs, through which the majority of reserve officers pass. Recruiting a much higher proportion of students – so that applicants are younger and have more time – should facilitate an expansion of Phase 2 training to make officers more credible to their regular peers, providing it is offered during university vacations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Staff training should be reformed in line with best practice from the UK’s sister countries to afford reservists the same opportunity that, with modern blended learning, could easily see them do a ‘reserve academic year’, trebling their study and training time without competing with a simultaneous reserve job or putting undue strain on civilian life. The added benefit of creating a stronger bond between the members of this leadership cohort should not be underestimated, nor should the ability to better talent-spot the rising stars. To support this, the Defence Academy needs greater senior reserve representation and designated reserve directing staff.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Army training courses should be adjusted in line with Anglophone best practice too – they need to be modular courses, with a greater proportion delivered in soldiers’ own units, but with arms school certification. There should be greater emphasis on recognising civilian skills already present to eliminate wasted time. Competency-based training should be introduced in a range of areas, starting with driving, allowing soldiers to take tests without doing the corresponding course. In line with the principle of unit cohesion, but to ensure standardisation and reduce travelling time, a more regional approach to training is needed, with each region having its own Army Training Unit (ATU), commanded by a reservist. The provision of more courses to train reserve instructors for both ATUs and units themselves is a priority. The Army Training Units should ideally be separate from regular facilities, but, where regular facilities are used, support contracts need to enable weekend training.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The counterpart of the above point on recognition of civilian skills by the military is that progress in getting civil recognition of military skills is good for a soldier’s relationship with their civilian employer. Reform of the mobilisation process will also help. More must be done in all parts of government, especially those buying goods and services, to incentivise companies employing reservists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The progress that Defence Relationship Management has made in developing the Armed Forces Covenant and in building a resource of thousands of gold, silver and bronze award winners must be built on, both to improve retention in peacetime and to assist in gaining employer support on mobilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collective training assurance should be introduced by measuring and recording the readiness of reserve units, using technology, including simulation, as is proposed in RF30. This can only be credible if we have larger – not smaller – units, especially in the infantry, as assessments cannot be credible without critical mass.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issue of loss of appetite for taking appropriate risk needs addressing across Defence, but specific provision needs to be made for ensuring that staffs who make decisions on health and safety have reserve representation. The project of detecting and rooting out the disproportionate damage done to reserve training by overzealous rules and application should be given to a named responsible officer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has highlighted the importance of mass and reminded us of how reserves can provide an affordable framework in peacetime to deliver capacity in war. As an island nation whose armed forces have an expeditionary focus, the UK’s best comparators are its major Anglophone counterparts in the Five Eyes pact – countries which share that expeditionary focus and a tradition of voluntarism rather than conscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparisons from the First World War to Afghanistan suggest that citizen soldiers can perform strongly – sometimes truly remarkably – when they have trained and played together and deploy with the right, volunteer, leadership. In contrast, repeated use of UK reserves to provide individual augmentees at the end of Operation Herrick disenfranchised the reserve officer cadre, and it has taken years to partially recover. To rebuild its Armed Forces for mass, the UK needs to focus on proven principles for the volunteer reserves while bringing in the latest technologies and ideas from the civilian world. Reserve forces have done this very often in the past, and Ukrainian reservists are doing it today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of cutting the Army Reserve by 10% and eroding the credibility of its infantry battalions by removing most of their support weapons, its size should be increased. A target should be to expand the Reserve from roughly one-third to approximately 80% of the size of the regular Army, in line with the average of the UK’s Anglophone sister countries. This should include substantially increasing the current shrunken establishment of units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structural reforms are also needed – some of these are in governance at the defence level. The UK needs improvements to recruiting, with a much greater focus on attracting students and driving down the long delays in the process. Training should be more modularised and more often delivered by units themselves, or regionally by (regional) Army Training Units. A greater emphasis should be placed on grouping people with members of their own units on basic training, in order to work with the grain of comradeship. Those arms schools where progress in distribution and modularisation lags behind should be required to introduce competency-based training whereby individuals can take rigorous tests without taking the course, starting with driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has focused on the Army Reserve, but similar work is needed on the other two services. How is it, for example, that at a time of extreme shortage of fast jet fighter pilots – and sharp competition across a range of aviation skills – there is so little scope for getting a second bang for the buck from ex-regulars serving part time, when the US has whole fast jet squadrons in its Air Guard? Why has the Navy been allowed to refuse to recognise civilian watchkeeping qualifications, ruining opportunities for seagoing Royal Naval Reserve officers? Why does the Royal Marines Reserve, despite heavy overheads, attract almost no young officers, preventing it from providing a route to mass, as its US counterpart did in the Second World War and more recently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mass is back in the news, as we see a nation mobilised in Ukraine. Technology is more important than ever, and reservists come from the civilian world, which is usually ahead of the armed forces – operational examples range from the astonishingly fast development of the Lewes bomb by the (citizen-led) SAS in the Second World War to the innovations that reservists have recently provided during the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reserve budgets should be separately identified and ringfenced to prevent them becoming the first port of call for cuts, and a new three-star reserve post should be introduced, with direct access to ministers. Above all, the UK needs more fighting power delivered through the Reserve, as an affordable route to mass, and reservists must have a greater role in leading it.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the mobilisation indicates a willingness to continue the war and challenge Western states.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Vladimir Putin announced the long-awaited mobilisation of Russian society to fight the war in Ukraine on 21 September. His speech, and the decree released at the same time, set in motion a series of actions across Russia’s military, and notionally its economy too, to prepare the country for war. However, there is a lot to understand about Russia’s system of mobilisation and how it has changed in the past 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specific conditions set forth in Putin’s decree cover those with former military experience, especially in desired areas such as drivers, gunners and artillerymen. It established clear grounds for those that would not be involved in the mobilisation, as well as the vague promise of quotas per region. It is worth noting that the decree is likely to disproportionately affect Russia’s poorer regions. The Russian armed forces are seen as one of the primary careers for young men from Dagestan, for example. This means that there will be more people in Dagestan liable for mobilisation than will be the case in other more affluent areas of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-soviet-hangover&quot;&gt;A Soviet Hangover&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, the Soviet Union acknowledged the importance of massed forces in a potential clash with NATO. It understood that without significant reserves of manpower and equipment, it would be unlikely to win in a prolonged conflict with the West. Because of this, the Soviet Union invested vast resources in a mass mobilisation system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is likely that the Russian armed forces will be able to ameliorate some of their major shortcomings through tactics, techniques and procedures, and the use of artillery&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, many of the cadres responsible for maintaining the equipment and knowledge were disbanded after 2008, leading to a loss of equipment and capability. In their place, the Russian armed forces began experimenting with an operational reserve, which initially set out to maintain some form of mass reserve and a smaller operational reserve that could be used more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bars&quot;&gt;BARS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decree was signed in 2014 announcing the formation of a voluntary military reserve. It was essentially re-announcing decrees issued in 2012 and 2013 but did lead to a small reserve system being explored experimentally in several regions. From 2016, reservists started participating in all major Russian exercises, although their role in those exercises is not clear. By 2018, Izvestia was reporting on the ‘full-scale formation of a mobilisation reserve’. Former service personnel were able to sign a contract with the Russian Ministry of Defence. In return they would receive a small salary, and be required to attend monthly classes along with annual exercises lasting 20–30 days. For comparison, the reserves encompassed by Putin’s mobilisation order are most likely part of the inactive mobilisation reserve, otherwise known as the ‘mobilisation human resource’. The voluntary reservists could be called up at any time, whether it be to alleviate a shortage of personnel in military units, for a ‘special or threatened period’, or in the event of major exercises and emergencies. The reserves were allocated to a Mobilisation Deployment Support Centre, which featured in exercises in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2021, the Russian armed forces and Russian news outlets were referring to the Special Combat Army Reserve (BARS), which carried many characteristics of the 2018 reserve system, indicating an element of continuity between 2015 and the BARS. Zvezda Weekly confidently proclaimed in September 2021 that 38,000 BARS reservists would be recruited in the Southern Military District (SMD) alone, although it was expected to take three years for the reserve to be completed. Nonetheless, the SMD commander, General Aleksandr Dvornikov, proudly reported the participation of BARS reservists in battalion- and regimental-level tactical exercises alongside regular forces that year, as well as the training of 30,000 reservists. Dvornikov appears to have been keen on employing modern military practices with the units under his command, which may in part explain why the SMD units have performed better than those from Russia’s other districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial rewards are understood to be a key form of motivation for many reservists, which are referred to as partisans by regular Russian soldiers and civilians – a reference to the Second World War reservists, who were prone to behaving more like partisans than soldiers. It is possible that the rushed effort to establish the BARS in the SMD and Central Military District (CMD) was actually in preparation for the war in Ukraine as there were exercises announced in Siberia in January, and others in the SMD at around the same time. The Russian Ministry of Defence said that 9,000 BARS contracts had been signed with citizens in the CMD. However, one Telegram account and other sources following troop deployments indicate that BARS personnel have already deployed to Ukraine; it is therefore difficult to assess whether Dvornikov’s efforts in 2021 will yield any significant contribution to the Russian armed forces at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;training&quot;&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training is an enormous challenge for any military; however, it is difficult to assess how the Russian system will cope with the sudden influx of up to the 300,000 personnel promised by Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. In theory, Russia maintains 11 higher education facilities responsible for training officers in frontline combat roles. Officers are very important to the Russian military system as they provide not only leadership but most training for the recruits and other ranks under their command. It is not clear how well staffed the officer training facilities are, but the Moscow Higher Combined Arms School indicates that it can support four battalions of officer cadets. Nonetheless, some instructors have reportedly been taken to form the command structures of new units already fighting in Ukraine. Because of this, the quantity of instructors left at Russia’s universities is unlikely to be sufficient to properly support a mass mobilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia’s technological reserve has deteriorated significantly since 1991&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, an alternative route for the training of mobilised reservists, which we call the Chechnya Model. For deployment to Chechnya, Russian forces realised that a much higher level of experience was required to fully utilise the effects of modern weaponry. As a result, pre-deployment training focused significant effort on improving weapon skills and knowledge. The second element was conducted in Chechnya by arriving units, who received specific training on the style of combat encountered at the time before conducting some live-fire drills. Typically, critical roles for combat, such as machine gunners and RPG operators, were assigned to those with the most experience, whereas those newly arrived in the combat zone became riflemen. It follows that the training model pursued for Russia’s mobilised forces might assume a number of these characteristics – the forces might not be optimal or as capable as their Ukrainian counterparts, but it is likely that the Russian armed forces will be able to ameliorate some of their major shortcomings through tactics, techniques and procedures, and the use of artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-grandfathers-tank&quot;&gt;My Grandfather’s Tank&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s technological reserve has deteriorated significantly since 1991. It is now possible to observe vast tank graveyards using the satellite feature on Google Maps. It is therefore unhelpful to consider the total number of tanks and armoured vehicles produced by the Soviet Union as an indicator of Russian stocks. Nonetheless, it is possible to draw some assessments from what is known about Russia’s maintenance facilities and procedures. In 2018, Russia maintained 40 bases ‘for the storage and repair of military equipment [BHiRVT]’, 14 of them for motorised rifle regiments. Each BHiRVT stores and maintains all the equipment necessary to equip a complete formation – such as a motorised rifle regiment. Reserves were notionally required to report to these bases in times of mobilisation, but one Russian defence expert noted in 2018 that few had been maintained with the adequate number of staff. Nonetheless, they may remain a significant reserve of equipment; there were as many as 400 towed guns at the 591st artillery warehouse in the Novgorod Region in 2018. By 2020, there were at least four tank storage bases, which provided shelter for legacy tank designs such as the T-55, T-62, T-64 and T-80. The number of tanks held at these sites is not known but could extend into the thousands. However, some – such as the T-64s – have been removed from storage to equip the separatist forces in Ukraine as well as allies in Syria and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is possible, and even likely, that Russia maintains sufficient reserves of equipment to arm large quantities of new units. Alexander Golts and Michael Kofman have suggested that the ground forces would require 60 reserve brigades to be mobilised to reach their wartime strength. It is unlikely that the 40 BHiRVT bases mentioned by Izvestia would meet this need. Irrespective of the number of brigades mobilised, some will be operating tanks that entered service when their grandfathers were conscripts, but this may not be the case across the entirety of the mobilised forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storage conditions also vary, and the Russian Ministry of Defence differentiates between four different types of storage: (1) Light – a heated room; (2) Medium – a closed unheated room; (3) Hard – outside, under a canopy; and (4) Very hard – in the open air or under a canopy in a maritime environment. Within this framework there is long- and short-term storage. Short-term is for high-readiness units with the equipment held in a state where it could be made ready to fight within hours. This includes regular maintenance of batteries and spare parts, convenient placement of weapon sights and even ammunition. Long-term storage requires periodic maintenance and repair that is supposed to be carried out by the manufacturer and the Russian armed forces. Removing equipment from long-term storage occurs in stages; the vehicles are depressurised and ‘depreserved’ before they are checked to ensure that they function as intended. This check can be carried out at the storage site or at the place of deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artillery available to the mobilised Russian forces is likely to make the greatest difference to their contribution. Russia has been able to make its advances thanks in large part to its use of massed artillery barrages that Ukraine has struggled to answer until recently. Tank combat does occur in Ukraine, and in those cases where it does, Ukraine’s T-64s would likely outmatch T-62s and T-55s, as well as any older T-72s. However, in those cases where Ukrainian infantry might face T-62s or other armoured fighting vehicles, without their own armour, or anti-armour weapons, they will be at a distinct disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-long-will-it-take&quot;&gt;How Long Will It Take?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high-readiness section of Russia’s reserve system has been exploited to generate the initial force that invaded Ukraine; this force is therefore unlikely to provide a rapid change to the war. The massed mobilisation will take some time, although it is unlikely that the Russian armed forces will be allowed the months that they would require to turn this force into something truly useful. Instead, Russia’s history of rushing forces into combat is likely to gain a new grizzly chapter as former servicemen are pushed into Ukraine in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

Centralized JADC2 guidance will be most useful to beat the drum for acquisition innovation, to drive interoperability among service programs and manage the seams between joint and service capabilities, to develop a management approach to ensure synchronization between existing and new elements as they are added in the future, to develop an experimentation agenda to reveal data sharing challenges to focus improvement efforts, and to serve as an entry point to C2 issues for partners and allies and to address issues of international data sharing. Along with these tasks, the JADC2 Cross Functional Team — or whatever ultimate central management function is instantiated — needs to focus on developing a common understanding and managing the architecture of the innovation ecosystem to achieve the Joint Force C2 vision.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of military command and control (C2) will be enabled by revolutions in information technology (IT). Step changes in computing power, almost unlimited cloud-enabled data storage, and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have opened up new opportunities for the Department of Defense (DoD) and the joint force. The capabilities enabled by this technological revolution have been a powerful motivator for new service-level programs working to enhance the capabilities available to military commanders. That said, the future fight demands that service capabilities work together seamlessly to ensure coherent multidomain warfighting strategies, meaning service-level C2 and targeting programs need to work together as a coherent whole. Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) is the DoD’s concept to connect sensors and communications from all of the military services — Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Space Force — into a single network. As laid out in the JADC2 strategy, the goal is to ensure that the joint force commander has “the capabilities needed to command the Joint Force across all warfighting domains and throughout the electromagnetic spectrum to deter, and, if necessary, defeat any adversary at any time and in any place around the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), the Navy’s Project Overmatch, and the Army’s Project Convergence are the three main efforts for advancing C2 at the service level. These programs seek cutting-edge targeting networks that match the right sensors to the right effectors to make forces more capable. Despite this unifying vision, these programs vary in approach, due to the different capabilities of each service. Project Convergence, the Army’s effort, focuses far more on exercises and experimentation as opposed to engineering enablers for existing capabilities. Project Overmatch and ABMS have a strong engineering emphasis with a focus on technology development, although there are fewer publicly available specifics on Project Overmatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this activity, the question remains as to how to best ensure that progress toward enhanced C2 is not impeded by predictable challenges. The history of efforts on both service and joint IT-related programs suggests that the pathway to developing JADC2 is filled with potential risks and pitfalls. The problem set features rapid technological change, the necessity of interoperability with existing systems and with new systems across the services, integration with allies and partners, new and non-traditional contractors, and novel acquisition approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief examines challenges in taking the next steps for enhanced C2 and targeting infrastructure and makes recommendations to help the U.S. military as it operates as a joint force and deploys with allies and partners. These recommendations are informed by the literature, by almost 20 non-attribution discussions with military and civilian experts from across the services (including current and retired personnel, up to the senior executive service (SES) civilian and general officer level) and defense contractors, and by participation at conferences and workshops, including one held at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. This work strove to identify strategic level challenges and relevant recommendations. In particular, the conversations with experts focused on enduring challenges that the interviewees did not think were being adequately addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research structured the discussions around four broad topics: (1) getting warfighters the C2 and targeting capabilities they need at the tactical edge, (2) integrating existing and new C2 technologies to support this goal, (3) management of the overall enterprise, and (4) the involvement of partners and allies. Asking these questions revealed challenges that, while difficult, the DoD has processes and procedures to address, such as the acquisition of complex technologies. It also revealed new concerns that will require both thoughtful recognition by leadership and creative solutions to address. Before examining each of these challenges in detail, this brief begins by exploring key observations about C2 and the implementation of JADC2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;observations&quot;&gt;Observations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;c2-is-a-fractal-challenge&quot;&gt;C2 is a fractal challenge.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective C2 at the “tactical edge” in a contested environment shares similar challenges whether the frame of reference is within a service, at the joint level, or when working with allies and partners. Within services, there are challenges accessing, maintaining, transmitting, securing, and using the necessary data at the speed of the warfighter requirements. Additionally, sharing data across service components, for example across Naval aviation, surface ships, and submarines, requires thoughtful management. Ensuring an effective command structure is an enduring necessity. These challenges are replicated at the joint level as combatant commands (CCMDs) pull together service capabilities and prepare to fight. Finally, when the United States is working with partners and allies, the same challenges emerge again. This implies that effective C2 is a fractal challenge — any part of the enterprise has many of the same patterns and issues to address. This observation does not in and of itself yield solutions to any challenges, but it does mean that solutions to challenges that work at one level may be able to be repurposed and updated to help improve other levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jadc2-exists-in-an-unusually-complex-ecosystem&quot;&gt;JADC2 exists in an unusually complex ecosystem.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strategy aimed at developing a complex integrated capability must reflect an understanding of the equities, incentives, and constraints of the participants in the relevant ecosystems. The JADC2 strategy exists in a notably complex ecosystem driven by the military services as they engage in their Title 10 responsibilities to organize, train, and equip as other stakeholders in the national security apparatus are working to meet their own missions. The military services are not monolithic, and the incentives for operators and those for acquisition personnel are different, driving complexity. The C2 ecosystem includes the Joint Force itself, with combatant commanders making decisions and relying on effective connections across warfighting domains. The ecosystem includes the partners and allies alongside whom the United States may go to war. At all levels, warfighters need data, and the data must be shared with them and back to others. Other U.S. government agencies and the intelligence community set standards and provide actionable information. Finally, the ecosystem includes the contractors who provide the capabilities that support the JADC2 concept — and who are leading the innovation effort for some of these capabilities, which often have commercial roots. Other supporting and gap-filler capabilities, such as DARPA’s System-of-systems Technology Integration Tool Chain for Heterogeneous Electronic Systems (STITCHES) program, may rely on multiple DoD offices for funding as they scale. The complexity inherent in the JADC2 concept is not completely new, and past attempts at a network-centric systems faced many of these challenges. That history is associated with prominent failures, even when constrained to a single service, such as the Army’s Future Combat System. Those past programs offer caution for the JADC2 enterprise and support the approach of building up from service efforts and supporting and expanding on local successes rather than imposing and enforcing a top-down acquisition effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jadc2-faces-a-highly-challenging-problem-set&quot;&gt;JADC2 faces a highly challenging problem set.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expectation underpinning the JADC2 concept is that future conflict will be taking place in an environment that is contested in all domains by a highly capable state actor. This assumption fits with the vision laid out in the National Defense Strategy and the general consensus that the pacing threat for the U.S. military is a resurgent China. This strategic context guides any serious analysis of JADC2 toward the hardest problems in command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR): the denied, or at the very least contested environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military has been effective at conducting C4ISR in permissive environments. Throughout operations in the Middle East since 9/11, the military has been able to control forces, share data, and cause kinetic effects. All of these capabilities have been possible in spite of a fractured C4ISR system, which the military has been able to use to support missions and effectively prosecute targets. The need for improved joint solutions such as JADC2 becomes necessary when planning for future conflicts in contested environments facing peer threats, which will necessitate rapid decision making and need to leverage data in new ways. Future conflict with a highly capable adversary, such as China, could be contested in all domains and take place across enormous operational theaters, all while the adversary has the advantage of operating near their borders. Nodes of the network may be attacked through cyber, electronic, or conventional means. A robust network should have multiple pathways for information, which means that connections with other services or with infrastructure managed by partner nations can be useful tools in building a more resilient network. If JADC2 is to add value to the capabilities of the joint force, its components must be able to function in that contested environment and manage significant distances between units, while taking advantage of the opportunities inherent in a networked concept. Understanding its operational environment is critical to understanding the context of the challenges faced by the JADC2 ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Future conflict with a highly capable adversary, such as China, could be contested in all domains and take place across enormous operational theaters, all while the adversary has the advantage of operating near their borders.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;existing-models-may-not-be-adequate-for-acquiring-new-capabilities&quot;&gt;Existing models may not be adequate for acquiring new capabilities.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective C2 is a not a new challenge but one that has endured throughout the history of warfighting as commanders have sought to communicate with distributed fighters and with one another. JADC2 represents the latest overarching effort to tie capabilities together effectively for the Joint Force. The unspoken but obvious implication here is that there will be some future effort aimed at solving the same challenge. Thus, JADC2 should not be understood as an endpoint or suite of capabilities with known end states but rather as several steps on the path toward greater interoperability across all domains in order to achieve joint effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language from policymakers, including some in Congress, suggests that the vision for JADC2 is a definable finite set of capabilities that DOD is seeking to acquire. In the fiscal year 2023 defense authorization bill, the House Armed Services Committee included a requirement that the secretary of defense deliver a report inventorying “JADC2-related development efforts with descriptions of performance objects, costs and schedules and a list of potential JADC2 capability gaps along with how DoD plans to address and fund those gaps.” That language suggests that the capabilities are finite and that the JADC2 acquisition effort has a notional end date when all of those discrete enablers are acquired and integrated. This is how the military traditionally understands and designs acquisition programs, with program managers evaluated on cost, schedule, and performance. To get a new capability under this traditional process-focused model, the DoD develops a formal requirement, holds a competition, and buys a solution which it then operates and maintains until it is time for an upgraded or replacement capability. This generational approach ensures that capabilities are delivered and slowly updated, that program managers are working toward a destination, and that Congress is funding an end product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forcing JADC2 into that model is a mistake. Many of the technologies in the JADC2 family of systems are evolving on a rapid commercial timeline. Even the more traditional defense hardware-oriented aspects of JADC2 have software that will need to be regularly updated to retain connectivity and address adversary threats. Planning for some notional end-state when JADC2 is “done” and delivered suggests that there is a static goal for C2. Instead of a fixed goal, JADC2 should be thought of as a long-term journey of improvement to suites of interconnected capabilities. The steps along this journey will not all be incremental–developing data architectures and standards may require time-intensive consultative processes and significant investments. Even these larger leaps are not an end point, but instead will need to further evolve and be integrated into a wider set of systems. This insight has been reflected in the creation of a JADC2 cross-functional team approach which focuses on merging efforts through working groups rather than enacting acquisition on its own. The majority of JADC2-specific solutions connect service-acquired capabilities. JADC2 may include a relatively small set of joint capabilities tying together more robust service-procured capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Instead of a fixed goal, JADC2 should be thought of as a long-term journey of improvement to suites of interconnected capabilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software development concepts like DevSecOps do incorporate an iterative approach where experience from operators feeds back into updates in a continuous flow, so the idea that IT-related capabilities need to be continually updated is not a new one. The DevSecOps approach could be a starting point for a JADC2 continuous development process, broadened out to include the interconnections between different families of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;one-challenge-is-managing-the-inevitable-seams-between-joint-and-service-acquisition-for-capabilities-designed-for-the-joint-force&quot;&gt;One challenge is managing the inevitable seams between joint and service acquisition for capabilities designed for the joint force.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As currently envisioned, the JADC2 strategy ties together service C2 programs and thus includes both service-level and joint acquisition challenges. Each service program brings together multiple capabilities to create a coherent intraservice C2 system. Pulling service programs together for joint operations in support of the JADC2 concept requires an additional level of coordination to ensure that service programs can communicate with each other and operate together. These connections should also be managed over time — as subcomponents of the systems are updated, those joint connections must remain robust to ensure JADC2’s continued effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are alternative approaches to acquiring a joint capability, all of which have benefits and challenges. The expert discussions during this research revealed that these trade-offs remain a matter of concern, even as the DoD proceeds with service programs focused on joint operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralized Development:&lt;/strong&gt; The status quo approach involves each service developing its own C4ISR capabilities that could be tied together to meet the operational requirements of the JADC2 concept in a joint operation. In interviews, experts from a nontraditional defense contractor and a major prime contractor cited positive moves on data governance and standardization in recent months, but the overall inclination of first prioritizing intraservice connections remains. This is tempered by the role played by the JADC2 cross-functional team approach and other coordination goals laid out in the JADC2 strategy, as well as the attention paid to making data “visible, accessible, understandable, linked, trustworthy, interoperable, and secure” across the DoD, as outlined in the Five Data Decrees memo put forward by Deputy Secretary of Defense Hicks. Service led models would ensure that programs are designed to meet simpler, smaller goals, which could then be tied together — avoiding what one interviewee described as an operational vision “on the scale of solving world hunger” — and achieve results at the speed of relevance. Service-level models also ensure clear operational focus and allow the services to balance priorities through the budgeting process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joint Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Joint Program Executive Offices (JPEOs) could serve as a function to centralize management of JADC2 procurement and ensure data standardization, interoperability, a common approach to cybersecurity, and international coordination. The F-35 joint program office was offered, with some hesitation, as an example of a centralized organization generally with a focus on its functions rather than its acquisition outcomes, for example, as a place to locate foreign partner representatives. In public statements, Lieutenant General Dennis Crall, the director of the DoD’s J6, has argued for a degree of centralization but pushed back against the idea of a single JPEO taking on the management of the service programs. A JPEO may enhance interoperability but could result in services getting suboptimal solutions and also lead to delays due to increased coordination needs. Even with these flaws, for those dissatisfied with decentralized implementation, a JPEO was often the starting point when considering other options — and one interviewee offered that this model can help ensure accountability by offering a “forehead Congress can thump” should there be performance challenges such as interoperability failures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Agency:&lt;/strong&gt; An independent agency could be used to acquire JADC2 capabilities and manage the enterprise. If the DoD decides to utilize a subordinate agency, it could either stand up a new agency or use an existing one such as the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to manage procurement and be a touch point for international partners. This approach did not get much attention in the expert discussions. (Other research has identified uncertainty over what role DISA will play given that “JADC2 will fundamentally reshape DISA’s traditional mission and set the future path for its existing capabilities.”)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead Military Service:&lt;/strong&gt; The DoD could designate a lead service for JADC2 development and procurement. CCMDs, agencies, and the other services would be directed by the lead service and have to work to make sure that each service is meeting their requirements. The challenge is that service C2 needs are driven by different domains with distinct operational needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead CCMD:&lt;/strong&gt; DoD could designate 1 of the 11 unified CCMDs, which are inherently joint and warfighter-focused, to lead the JADC2 effort. The DoD could designate a functional command, such as Cyber Command, or geographic combatant command, such as Indo-Pacific Command. Experts did not propose a single lead CCMD but repeatedly discussed the potential benefits of the CCMDs playing a larger role, given that geographic commands are a natural choice for identifying operators’ immediate needs in a region. That said, one expert cautioned that interoperability investments have not been high on CCMD priority lists in the past. Another, while not suggesting a particular structure, argued that the critical thing missing was achieving something “truly joint that’s attached to joint operational commanders.” That said, any joint approach will need to ensure that service-specific sensor to shooter kill chains are not made less effective in the search for commonality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the structure of the acquisition organization came up in almost every interview suggests expert interest in ensuring that the acquisition strategy recognizes the risks inherent in a service-centered approach, even one with a coordination function as laid out in the JADC2 strategy document. Here and elsewhere, ensuring the joint warfighter perspective is captured in service-led acquisition is an abiding concern — and that is one of the important process contributions that a joint function can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the concerns of experts, JADC2 acquisition should include the services doing a significant portion of the acquisition work and a joint function to ensure interoperability and to develop and manage an overarching technical architecture. Fortunately, services have been the traditional venue for acquisition, and so their challenges will be heavily focused on capturing new vendors and developing contract approaches for IT-driven systems. More challenging will be the joint component of the acquisition program. Currently the DoD Chief Information Officer and the J6 perform oversight of the JADC2 enterprise, and that has limited inherent problems from a process perspective. However, if this approach, or any centralized approach, begins to falter, there are several critical warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Here and elsewhere, ensuring the joint warfighter perspective is captured in service-led acquisition is an abiding concern — and that is one of the important process contributions that a joint function can provide.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lack of operational interoperability, which will beevident through joint experimentation, exercises, or real-world responses to crises&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A failure to make iterative progress on Services goals due to ambitious central goals that do not deliver near-term benefits&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lack of a single touch point for congressional oversight and accountability&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lack of a single touch point for partners and allies as they seek to integrate and understand U.S. systems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Constraints generated by the services that limit the use of data standards and open systems and interfaces even when technically viable&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limited or no common understanding of the threat picture and the most urgent challenges that need to be solved&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lack of meaningful joint testing and unclear evidence that the services are using the results of experimentation (although this is something of a lagging indicator since lessons from testing may come too late in program planning to generate change)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along with ensuring that acquisition interests are balanced, the JADC2 ecosystem will need to manage these risks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-key-task-will-be-ensuring-innovation-survives-acquisition&quot;&gt;A key task will be ensuring innovation survives acquisition.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iwvxSqb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Number of Vendors in the Defense Electronics, Comms, and Sensors Portfolio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology development for DoD systems can be driven either by the DoD through the requirements and acquisition processes or by commercial industry as it works to develop products that will be successful in the relevant marketplace. In the aviation context, for example, fighter aircraft have no analogy in the commercial world in terms of performance requirements, so government investments have driven necessary innovations such as stealth. Engines for transport and tanker aircraft are often entirely or mostly commercial, and innovation is driven by the commercial market. The business model for airlines has led to reliability and efficiency improvements in these engines, which the DoD has benefited from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT-driven military C2 programs may have originally been driven by the DoD’s needs, but over the last several decades, the expansion of commercial IT applications has meant that the DoD follows and benefits from IT development and innovation rather than leading it. Within the context of JADC2, the DoD will have to pursue development and procurement across both avenues while working on synchronizing its efforts with the pace of commercial innovation. Figure 1 shows the number of vendors supplying electronics, communications technologies, and sensors to the DoD and is based on Federal Procurement Data Systems (FPDS) information on government spending. CSIS’s analysis of the FPDS data reveals that there has been a steady decline in the total number of companies in this sector in the last 15 years, dropping by 37 percent. The absolute number of new entrants was higher 15 years ago and then declined along with the total number of vendors. It has more recently bumped up by over 300 vendors, returning to the pre-sequestration count — but as a percentage of the total vendors, new vendors have increased even more to 9.7 percent, a higher rate than other portfolios such as land vehicles, ships and submarines, or facilities and construction. If sustained, this higher rate of new entrants would be a sign that focused outreach to the commercial IT industry is beginning to produce industrial base dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the technologies enabling the JADC2 concept — those closest to the goal of more rapid closing of kill chains — will have no general commercial equivalent. The DoD will need to drive innovation for these as it has for many systems in the past. In others, such as data storage and data processing, the DoD will have to follow the lead of — and benefit from investments by — the commercial market to capture innovations at the speed of operation relevance. One commercial industry expert also raised a middle case — software-defined networks — where the DoD may need to rely on an approach developed outside the DoD that nonetheless has somewhat niche commercial market adoption but addresses key operational needs. While both ends of the spectrum have their own trade-offs and acquisition risks, a bigger challenge may be synchronizing commercial- and DoD-led capabilities into a coherent whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One challenge is that Silicon Valley’s products for commercial customers are not designed to be operated in a risky combat environment at the tactical edge; the DoD will need to drive solutions for low bandwidth-contested environments. When it comes to managing the acquisition of equipment for communication in a contested environment, the DoD is postured and has process tools to be able to acquire the capabilities the warfighter demands. What makes this segment of the JADC2 problem easier to navigate (if difficult to achieve because of the technical complexity of the components) is that it closely follows acquisition models set up by the DoD. The DoD generally has monopsony power (i.e., it is the only buyer) in the market for complex defense systems and has decades of experience working with its traditional contractor base to develop solutions for defense-specific problems. Communications platforms for contested environments fall well within that category because there is not significant civilian demand for jam-resistant communications systems, for example. While the DoD may be more accustomed to this problem, it should not close the door to outside innovation. Innovation in this communications problem could very well come from new vendors that are developing novel technologies such as laser-based communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;One challenge is that Silicon Valley’s products for commercial customers are not designed to be operated in a risky combat environment at the tactical edge; the DoD will need to drive solutions for low bandwidth-contested environments.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD has had a long history of struggling to capture commercial innovations. What makes JADC2 an especially difficult problem for acquisition officials is they will not be fielding a single, steady-state capability. Approaches to exploring include “as-a-service” acquisition and working with nontraditional vendors, along with expertise in managing multiple pathways in the Adaptive Acquisition Framework. For any of these approaches, new systems will have to employ open architectures that are tied to evolving JADC2 structure and standards and that are accessible to all qualified vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As-a-service contracting is promising because of the speed of innovation in the private sector and how quickly technologies will have to be upgraded to stay on the cutting edge. Traditional government requirements set strict guidelines for suppliers and take place within an often slow acquisition process. If the DoD can embrace as-a-service contracting for components of JADC2 (likely non-denied cloud and AI/ML), then it will be better able to iterate technology at the speed of technological relevance and deliver capability to the warfighter at the speed of operational relevance. By building requirements around capabilities and not technical requirements, the DoD, along with a trusted contractor, can develop and deploy systems faster than would be possible with a traditional contracting approach. As service contracting combines well with software-defined systems to allow systems to keep pace with evolving C2 needs, although there could also be a hardware module update aspects to such arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key component of capturing the technical innovation needed to make JADC2 work is bringing in technologies from outside the DoD’s traditional vendor ecosystem. The DoD has traditionally relied on a relatively small group of prime contractors that often specialize in the defense market. For technologies where the commercial market is driving innovation, including cloud computing and AI/ML, the DoD should engage outside of its traditional vendor base. Nontraditional companies have experience with cutting-edge technologies and expert workforces and thus may be positioned to adapt their technology to defense applications at the speed of relevance. The challenge is that nontraditional companies generally use capabilities like utilizing communications, networking, and cloud infrastructures that were not designed for use in an expeditionary or contested environment. The need thus is to identify where commercial companies currently offer technologies usable in contested environments, where they could with a reasonable amount of additional investment, and where it would be infeasible or not worthwhile for them to participate in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge of bringing nontraditional contractors into the defense ecosystem is also not a new one and not limited to the JADC2 problem set. Part of the challenge is that the people and organizations responsible for the acquisition of JADC2-related capabilities acquisition are not the same people or organizations involved in acquisition process improvement efforts. Evolving acquisition approaches to facilitate acquisition of JADC2 capabilities may benefit from a direct connection between the two efforts, with acquisition streamlining and improvement efforts deliberately using JADC2 capabilities as the test case for change. By working on synchronizing the DoD’s efforts to the commercial ecosystem, the department may be able to develop technologies that maintain pace with the commercial world or at least reduce the current delay in fielding cutting-edge technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JADC2 will require an approach to testing and experimentation that links to its structure as an evolving set of interoperable systems (which again will require open architectures and increasing use of software-defined capabilities). Aiming at a point where development or testing is “complete” will mean that the framework for the program does not include the consistent onboarding of new capabilities. Testing will need to be an ongoing part of the program rather than a step to complete along the way, of which testing interoperability of service-based systems as they evolve is a significant driver. The sheer scale and complexity of the systems will further complicate testing. While live testing is necessary to unpack challenges, a JADC2-focused virtual test environment would facilitate more continuous testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;along-with-improving-coordination-inside-dod-effective-employment-of-jadc2-in-the-future-fight-will-require-bridging-the-gap-with-allies&quot;&gt;Along with improving coordination inside DoD, effective employment of JADC2 in the future fight will require bridging the gap with allies.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of working with allies and partners was stressed in nearly every one of the expert discussions. That the United States will not fight alone in the future is a truism, and JADC2 is in part designed to facilitate integration with allies and partners, although there are still many areas needing further definition. Furthermore, there is evidence that JADC2 programs are engaged in developing the necessary relationships now to ensure that they will be practiced in case of a future fight. The Army’s 2022 Project Convergence exercises, for example, were designed to include international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of these and other efforts underway, interviewees frequently raised the concern that many aspects of this cooperation have not been worked out. Specifically, while this coordination challenge is well known, efforts to resolve it have not gotten to the level of detail necessary to develop confidence in the exchange of critical information in advance of a fight. In particular, C2 cooperation with allies was highlighted as making interoperability more difficult to achieve. Part of the challenge is the profusion and heterogeneity of systems both within the United States at various levels of classification and across U.S. partners. Multiple experts raised the concern that the capability for handling classified materials has to be baked in from the start; iteration from an open system does not have a straightforward path for evolution to handle higher levels of classification later. That said, this can be solved through the acquisition of systems that can be accessed by multiple partners at different levels of classification — so this is a problem that has an acquisition solution, no matter how complicated that solution may be in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A larger challenge comes from what will actually happen during a fight. In every contingency, the force generating the data will need to determine what information it does and does not want to share with its allies (and they will naturally do the same). Furthermore, the levels of data sharing and information access may vary over the course of the battle. Some questions to address include: What are the triggers for data sharing? What might trigger data sharing at different levels of classification? Who is responsible for identifying when allies and partners need more data, and who is in charge of getting it to them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kinds of technology and infrastructure need to be in place in advance of the fight to facilitate data sharing? These are the kinds of questions that interviewees were more concerned about than the specifics of the networks over which information will be shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions will likely differ in every engagement, but none of the interviewees raised technical challenges as the main concern. Rather, they were focused on the process for identifying key questions and the approach for developing answers — and recommended doing this in advance. Allied defense organizations may often be willing to scale up data sharing in a crisis, but without advanced preparations, willingness will not translate into effective coordination. One strong recommendation throughout the interviews and in the literature was to not wait until any future engagement starts to begin the process of integrating partners and practicing the information exchange. Experimentation can help identify the political barriers to working with other nations. One interviewee suggested the necessity of working with allies and partners begins with setting requirements and highlighted the preferability of doing so from the beginning rather than in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allied defense organizations may often be willing to scale up data sharing in a crisis, but without advanced preparations, willingness will not translate into effective coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with following the Five Data Decrees, additional solutions to the challenge of working with partners include open interfaces so that a variety of systems can plug into a common backbone and exchange information. A second is involving the contractor base in experiments to allow for early insight into data-sharing sticking points and evolve requirements along the way. Regardless of the approach, it is clear that experimentation and exercising with allies is critical if JADC2 is to be interoperable with allies and partners. The future is uncertain, and even if experiments are wrong, specific lessons drawn from exercises will help with understanding what decisions need to be made and how to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concluding-thoughts-moving-from-admiring-the-challenges-to-focusing-on-solutions&quot;&gt;Concluding Thoughts: Moving from Admiring the Challenges to Focusing on Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One theme resonated throughout the expert interviews. Rather than focus on JADC2 as a distinct set of capabilities and enablers and as an endpoint to a set of acquisition programs, it should be understood as a guidepost for an effort across the defense enterprise to advance C4ISR capabilities to meet the challenges of future conflict against a peer adversary. Understanding JADC2 as a process will help the DoD focus on innovation instead of acquisition. The mission, the threat landscape, and perhaps even the pacing threat will change over time, and the technology will need to change and evolve in parallel. The very nature of C2, with its interconnected set of capabilities, advocates for an open-system approach where new innovations can seamlessly plug into existing architectures. This framework for understanding JADC2 will enable the DoD to take more incremental steps to improving its capabilities, including C4ISR, as opposed to attempting to take a generational leap. This will almost certainly help control costs while driving up fielded performance. Some aspects of this problem, such as developing a successor to the Link 16 architectures, evolving data standards, or providing a joint commercial cloud, may benefit from more centralized approaches, but these mission sets should be tightly defined and take on no more complexity than necessary. This requires the recognition that aspects of the programs that rely on interconnected software, especially commercial derivative technology, may never be “complete” in the sense of a static delivered capability. The DoD should treat the JADC2 concept as a guiding North Star for managing innovation rather than as a set of procurement programs with a final delivery endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring progress toward the JADC2 vision will be difficult in an environment where the requirements and capabilities for these technologies are constantly evolving. The DoD will likely never be able to meet the goal of connecting every sensor with every effector, especially on a battlefield becoming increasingly sensor saturated and complex. That does not mean the DoD should simply surrender. Instead, the DoD should develop meaningful metrics and goals for improvement towards the goal of the technology. Measuring progress toward meaningful goals will be difficult in a space where the goal posts themselves will continue to change, but doing so could help secure funding, attention, and results for the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tension to consider is that attempting revolutionary change can reduce attention to current problems. Generational changes like JADC2 tend to focus on time and resource-intensive steps with the potential for enormous payoffs in the longer term — but at the potential expense of putting off important challenges that could be addressed in the near term but have characteristics that the present system is not incentivized to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For C2, the acquisition system is making slow but steady progress on intraservice capabilities but lags on progress on joint and international cooperation. Waiting until JADC2 capabilities are delivered to address these current challenges could mean that solutions are not adequately incorporated during development, and that gaps remain in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the challenges and opportunities for JADC2 are necessary but not sufficient to address the thorny problems inherent in such a complex effort. The JADC2 CFT — as the organization assigned by DoD leadership to execute the JADC2 strategy (or whatever ultimate central management function is instantiated) — needs to go beyond the management of “the plans of actions, milestones, and resourcing requirements” toward the development of a common understanding and management of the architecture of the innovation ecosystem to achieve the Joint Force C2 vision.&lt;/p&gt;

Moscow’s effort was likely unsuccessful due to a fundamental misalignment of interests between the Kremlin and Viktor Gushan, the most powerful player in Transnistria.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Kremlin’s failure to coerce Transnistrian leadership could be part of the dynamic, along with recent Ukrainian battlefield successes, driving Moscow to annex occupied territory in Ukraine. This failure also demonstrates the extent to which Moscow’s proxies and allies are hesitant to join the Kremlin’s faltering invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 5:00 p.m. on April 25, a series of explosions rocked the Ministry of State Security (MGB) headquarters in Transnistria, a Russian-backed breakaway republic in Moldova. Transnistria’s president quickly went on air and spoke live to the nation, blaming Ukraine for these “terrorist attacks” and demanding that Kyiv crack down on rogue militant groups within its borders. Russian officials began commenting on the explosions the next day and warned of the dangers of “Ukraine’s attacks” in Transnistria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This series of events alarmed many international observers. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was stalling at the time. Some experts feared that Moscow would attempt to open an additional front by invading Ukraine through Transnistria, which the bombings looked like the perfect pretense for. The Critical Threats Project assesses that the bombings were likely an attempt by Moscow to involve Transnistria in the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More remarkable than the explosions was what came after them — nothing. There was no significant reaction from the Transnistrian breakaway state. This lack of reaction suggests that Moscow failed to strong-arm Transnistria. While it is unclear what exactly the Kremlin wanted from Transnistrian leadership, it is clear that it wanted them to do something. This failure to coerce is an instructive case on the limits of the Kremlin’s power at a time when Moscow is considering what to do with its proxies in Russian-occupied areas in Ukraine. Understanding this failure may predict the Kremlin’s future course of action with its Ukrainian proxies. The Kremlin may also continue to pressure Transnistria even if success is unlikely. It is important to understand the Transnistrian breakaway state structure to understand what went wrong for the Kremlin in Transnistria and the limits of this case’s predictive power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-transnistria&quot;&gt;What Is Transnistria?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transnistria is an unrecognized breakaway republic on the left bank of the Dniester River in Moldova. The region declared its independence in 1990 amid the breakup of the Soviet Union and achieved de facto independence from Moldova in 1992 after Russian troops intervened in fighting between Transnistrian and Moldovan forces, killing 700 troops. The region has remained in this de facto independent state since 1992. Roughly 1,500 Russian troops are still stationed there. The vast majority of people in Transnistria speak Russian, and the region has retained many Soviet-era symbols and practices. The Kremlin maintains significant influence in Transnistria as its primary international sponsor. Moscow values this influence because Transnistria’s de facto independence prevents Moldova from joining Western alliance structures and keeps it in Russia’s sphere of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;formal-structure-of-transnistria&quot;&gt;Formal Structure of Transnistria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transnistria is officially a presidential republic. The president is head of the executive branch and appoints a prime minister with little authority. The Supreme Council is the sole legislative body, with the Renewal Party currently occupying 29 of its 33 seats. Transnistria’s president is a member of the Renewal Party, giving it total control over the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian aid to Transnistria is crucial to Transnistrian government operations and solidifies a strategic partnership. Russia effectively supplies the region with natural gas free of charge, delaying indefinitely the $7 billion that it owes Moscow for gas. This free natural gas is the key pillar of Transnistria’s economy, as “separatist authorities relied on income from natural gas–derived products for 53% of their budgetary spending in 2019 and for 40% in 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian platforms also serve as essential middlemen between Transnistria and the global economy. For example, Transnistria’s state bank uses Russian Sberbank to execute all international transactions, because global corporations will not operate with it directly. Transnistrian authorities repay this Russian support by emphasizing their close ties with Moscow. Transnistria’s current president Vadim Krasnoselsky in 2018 affirmed his commitment to ensuring that Transnistria eventually becomes part of Russia. Transnistria’s head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs said in 2019 that Transnistria “remains an outpost of the Russian world in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;informal-structure-of-transnistria&quot;&gt;Informal Structure of Transnistria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main players in Transnistria whose power overshadows that of the territory’s official governing structures: Sheriff Enterprises, a company owned by ex-KGB agent Viktor Gushan, and the Ministry of State Security (MGB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gushan-and-sheriff&quot;&gt;Gushan and Sheriff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informally, Transnistria is a mafia state ruled by ex-KGB agent Gushan, who owns a company called Sheriff Enterprises. Sheriff-affiliated companies receive one-third of Transnistria’s government spending and control 60 percent of the region’s economy. Sheriff also sponsors the Renewal Party. President Krasnoselsky is a member of the Renewal Party and worked as an adviser to the head of a Gushan-owned company from 2012 to 2015 before becoming president in 2016. This stranglehold means that Sheriff, and Gushan by extension, effectively controls Transnistria’s government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gushan and business partner Ilya Kazmaly founded Sheriff in 1993 in the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The business venture started out as a cigarette smuggling operation. Gushan leveraged his border-control contacts to ensure his goods crossed the long Ukraine-Transnistria border unimpeded. Gushan then again leveraged his old KGB contacts to outmaneuver his competition in buying up formerly state-owned enterprises in Transnistria. Sheriff’s business ventures now include supermarkets, gas stations, and internet providers and companies in the telecommunications, textile production, broadcast and cable television, auto sales, publishing, cognac production, light manufacturing, and advertising industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-mgb&quot;&gt;The MGB&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only significantly powerful organization outside of Gushan’s control in Transnistria is the Russian-dominated MGB. There is likely competition between the MGB and Sheriff for influence in Transnistria, despite the lack of clear evidence of infighting in open source media. The MGB is commonly understood to be a “department of the Russian FSB (Federal Security Service)” and likely takes orders directly from Moscow. MGB heads almost always come from the ranks of the Russian security apparatus. Transnistria’s first MGB head, Vladimir Antyufeev, worked in the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Riga, Latvia under the Soviet Union. Antyufeev led a coup that failed to keep Latvia from leaving the Soviet bloc in 1991 during his tenure in Riga. Antyufeev also claims to have later traveled to Crimea and helped set conditions for Russia’s absorption of Crimea in 2014. He was appointed First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Donetsk People’s Republic after his time in Crimea. The current head of the MGB, Valery Gebos, served in the Soviet border guards from 1984-1991.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MGB’s responsibilities and long tenure indicate the organization’s influence. The MGB’s most important, and lucrative, responsibility is border control. Regulating the inflow and outflow of goods allows the MGB to extract rents on both legal and illegal goods. This responsibility likely gives the MGB significant resources to command. Heads of the MGB tend to serve long tenures and are not often rotated. These long tenures allow MGB heads to establish significant human networks, entrench themselves in their positions, and accrue influence. MGB heads tend to serve the entire length of the president’s tenure. For example, Transnistria’s first MGB head, Vladimir Antyufeev, held his post during the entire 20-year tenure of President Igor Smirnov. Likewise, the current MGB head, Valery Gebos, has been in office for six years as President Krasnoselsky nears the midpoint of his second term in office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interest-misalignment-between-transnistria-and-the-kremlin&quot;&gt;Interest Misalignment Between Transnistria and the Kremlin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s attempt to draw Transnistria into the war in Ukraine likely failed because Gushan’s Sheriff Enterprises and the Russian-dominated MGB have fundamentally different interests. Sheriff’s primary interests are economic, while Russia’s are political.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gushan benefits from the current status quo of receiving Russian subsidies while selling products on European markets. Sheriff’s exports to the EU currently dwarf its exports to the Russia-dominated Eurasian Economic Union. Sheriff’s pivot toward Western trade began in 2014 when the Moldovan government signed a trade deal with the EU that guaranteed tariff-free access to EU markets. Transnistrian businesses were included in this tariff exemption as long as they were registered in Transnistria and submitted to customs checks by Moldovan officials. A “massive swing” in trade took place shortly thereafter, as 58 percent of all exports from Transnistria went to the EU in the first three months of 2016. In contrast, just 6 percent of all exports went to the Eurasian Economic Union. By comparison, only 27 percent of Transnistrian exports went to the EU in 2015. These Western-oriented exports incentivize Gushan to maintain economic contacts with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gushan also has a vested interest in reestablishing cordial relations with neighboring Ukraine. Transnistria imported and exported most of its goods through Ukraine’s Black Sea ports until Russia invaded and Ukraine closed its border with Transnistria for the first time in 30 years. This border closure means that Transnistria’s only way to import and export goods to the global market is through Moldova, which is an uncomfortable arrangement for the breakaway republic. Gushan is likely economically motivated to normalize relations with Ukraine enough to reopen the border. He is unlikely to accept permanent reliance on Moldova to remain economically solvent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s main goal with the MGB was to strong-arm Transnistria into supporting Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine, which ultimately failed. The MGB’s goals contradict Sheriff’s goals because overtly supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would likely imperil Sheriff’s lucrative business ties with the West. Transnistria’s refusal to support Moscow’s campaign suggests that Gushan won the power struggle for control over Transnistria and stands as the strongest player in the territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-defeats-in-ukraine-have-likely-devalued-the-kremlins-coercive-power-over-transnistria&quot;&gt;Russian Defeats in Ukraine Have Likely Devalued the Kremlin’s Coercive Power over Transnistria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s faltering invasion of Ukraine has likely devalued its military coercive power over Transnistria. The Kremlin’s military presence in Transnistria is weak. There are currently approximately 1,500 Russian troops stationed in Transnistria. Only 50–100 of these are Russian soldiers dispatched from Russia. The remaining 1,400 troops are Transnistrian locals who have been given Russian passports and serve as Russian soldiers. Two units make up this 1,500-strong contingent: the peacekeeping force (MC) and the Operational Group of Russian Forces (OGRF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MC is the smaller of the two and is responsible for patrolling security zones between Transnistria and Moldova. The OGRF is stationed without any agreement from Moldova and guards a large ammunition depot that remains from the Soviet Union. These troops engage in regular military exercises, but they are very poorly equipped. The poor performance level of Russian troops fighting in Ukraine suggests that the troops in Transnistria would perform poorly in combat. Furthermore, their overwhelming status as native Transnistrians means they offer little coercive power over the Transnistrian government itself, since they are unlikely motivated to attack their homeland to enforce Russian demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poor performance of the Kremlin’s troops in Ukraine also decreases the likelihood that Moscow will airdrop troops into Transnistria or otherwise use the territory as a springboard for operations into Ukraine. The Kremlin has lost significant numbers of troops since the invasion began and is struggling to make even incremental territorial gains in eastern Ukraine. Moscow is unlikely to have the spare manpower to open a new front in the west, pushing on Odessa. The Kremlin has little ability to militarily coerce Transnistria without the threat of the arrival of additional trained Russian forces. The Kremlin’s failure to coerce Transnistria may affect its decision-making regarding the degree of control it chooses to exert over occupied territories in Ukraine. This experience may also have several implications for the decision-making of other Kremlin proxies and allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow’s failure to coerce Transnistria into joining its invasion of Ukraine has implications for how the Kremlin interacts with its proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A caveat.&lt;/strong&gt; Transnistria is an outlier among the Kremlin’s proxies. Gushan has assembled significantly more economic and political power in Transnistria than any local actor has assembled in the Kremlin’s other proxies. The predictive power of Transnistria’s case is therefore limited. This case nevertheless offers valuable information about the limits of the Kremlin’s coercive power and offers hints as to how the Kremlin may act with its proxies in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kremlin will likely attempt to directly absorb into the Russian Federation the territory it captured in Ukraine rather than turning it into a Transnistria-style client state.&lt;/strong&gt; The huge amount of political, economic, and diplomatic capital the Kremlin has invested in its Ukraine invasion means it cannot afford to lose control over annexed territory. Moscow will therefore likely attempt to avoid the headache of managing a client state by directly absorbing the captured Ukrainian territory into the Russian Federation, which would give the Kremlin direct control over it. Russia’s absorption of these territories would not likely carry any additional political cost, because Western leaders are unlikely to decrease sanctions pressure on Russia in the short to medium term, no matter what the Kremlin does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kremlin likely has insufficient bandwidth and capital to increase its control over Transnistria in the short to medium term.&lt;/strong&gt; Moscow’s security services are likely using all of their operational bandwidth on securing territory it has captured in Ukraine. The security services likely do not have the time or resources to invest in the MGB to increase the ministry’s influence in Transnistria. Transnistria will therefore likely continue to balance between the West and Russia to maintain its access to Western markets and free Russian energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Russian military’s poor performance in Ukraine likely played a role in deterring Transnistria from participating in its invasion.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia’s forces have become bogged down in eastern Ukraine over the first seven months of the war. This poor performance made joining the operation an unattractive proposition. Transnistrian leadership likely calculated that joining the invasion or offering significant assistance would net only marginal returns. Conversely, aiding the invasion would significantly damage lucrative economic ties with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Russian military’s poor performance has likely deterred and will continue to deter Belarus from directly participating in the invasion.&lt;/strong&gt; Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is likely conducting the same cost-benefit analysis that Transnistria’s leaders conducted — and reaching a similar conclusion. Minsk has so far refrained from sending troops into Ukraine, despite its willingness to allow the Russian military to launch missiles from Belarus and use it as a staging ground for the invasion. Lukashenko likely correctly assesses that directly joining the invasion would lead to significantly increased Western pressure and threaten his hold on power. Minsk will consequently likely continue to refrain from directly participating in the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Will Baumgardner</name></author><summary type="html">The series of bombings in Transnistria in late April was likely a false flag operation executed by the Kremlin intended to draw Transnistria into its invasion of Ukraine.

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western media reported that the health of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has declined rapidly, driving speculation that he may soon die. The most likely scenario after his death is that a hardline cleric succeeds him. This successor will likely have the same worldview as Khamenei and may adopt an even more aggressive stance towards the US and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khamenei has ruled Iran for over three decades since becoming supreme leader in 1989 and shaped the modern Iranian state as we know it. He has enabled and supported the regime’s aggressive and authoritarian policies. He has empowered the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) to become a dominant economic, political, security, and socio-cultural force within the country. His passing will be truly epochal in Iran and likely the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-a-hardline-cleric-succeeds-khamenei&quot;&gt;1. A hardline cleric succeeds Khamenei&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A hardline cleric becomes supreme leader through a peaceful and quick transition of power.&lt;/strong&gt; Hardline frontrunners for succession include President Ebrahim Raisi and Mojtaba Khamenei — the son of Ali Khamenei. The supreme leader, his inner circle, and the IRGC have indicated support for both candidates, but it is unclear which they prefer. They are likely already trying to influence the succession process to install their preferred candidate and may succeed. This scenario is currently the most likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raisi and Mojtaba are both hardline clerics just as radical as Ali Khamenei if not more so.&lt;/strong&gt; Raisi and Mojtaba are old enough to remember the 1979 Iranian Revolution and either fought in or lost family and friends in the Iran-Iraq War — both crucible experiences that have unified Iranian leaders for decades. Raisi was a prosecutor in the judiciary during the war and played a prominent role in persecuting political dissent and consolidating the regime’s power. Mojtaba fought in the Habib ibn Mazahir Battalion in the war and remains close to those with whom he served. They both came of age and have come to power in the context of constant conflict with the US and an expanding military struggle against Israel. These dynamics make them more likely to pursue similar — if not more aggressive policies — to those of Ali Khamenei. Raisi or Mojtaba would almost certainly remain committed to pursuing the same grand strategic objectives as Khamenei, which include attaining regional hegemony, destroying the Israeli state, and expelling America from the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new hardline supreme leader like Raisi or Mojtaba would still face immediate challenges in asserting his authority and controlling the regime, however.&lt;/strong&gt; Any successor at the start of his tenure will initially be weaker than Khamenei at the end of his and could struggle to control and mediate between the often-fractious regime power centers. Ali Khamenei was similarly weak when first becoming supreme leader in 1989 and had to consolidate his power in the subsequent decades. He did so in part by building up the IRGC as a major force within the Islamic Republic. He enabled the IRGC to expand its dominance over the economy and involvement in politics. His successor will have to reckon with the IRGC’s force without having Khamenei’s gravitas and history in creating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRGC has become one of the most powerful actors within the regime under Khamenei and will likely continue influencing regime behavior after Khamenei dies. A weaker supreme leader may struggle to command or constrain an IRGC trying to preserve its dominant role in a post-Khamenei Iran. A new supreme leader who chose to wrestle with the IRGC rather than yielding to its demands might instead disrupt decision-making processes and the development and implementation of Iranian defense and foreign policies, although this course of action is less likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raisi could install a close ally as president to consolidate his power if he became supreme leader. The Iranian constitution dictates that Raisi’s first vice president, Mohammad Mokhber, would become president if Raisi resigned to become supreme leader. The constitution leaves the supreme leader the flexibility to appoint a different president if the first vice president dies or cannot otherwise perform his duties. Supreme Leader Raisi could easily exploit this authority to install whichever political ally he wants as president considering the broad latitude Khamenei has reserved to himself and the Guardian Council to decide whether candidates for office or officeholders are able to perform their duties using ideological criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raisi and Mojtaba would likely be unpopular domestically, further challenging their authority and power.&lt;/strong&gt; They both have enforced and supported repressive policies for decades. Mojtaba has the added challenge of having to justify a dynastic succession. The 1979 revolution overturned the Pahlavi dynastic monarchy and dynastic succession remains fundamentally incompatible with the regime’s revolutionary ideology. Ali Khamenei has previously criticized hereditary succession, complicating Mojtaba’s hopes of succeeding his father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-prolonged-intra-regime-negotiation&quot;&gt;2. Prolonged, intra-regime negotiation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The regime fails to agree on a new supreme leader, triggering a protracted but peaceful intra-regime negotiation for weeks, months, or years.&lt;/strong&gt; Iran could enter a period of political deadlock if the Assembly of Experts — the body designated with selecting the supreme leader — or other regime power centers cannot agree on a supreme leader. This scenario is the second most likely after scenario one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The regime could form an interim leadership council to execute the basic responsibilities of the supreme leader in this scenario.&lt;/strong&gt; The Iranian constitution dictates that the regime will temporarily form such a council consisting of the president, judiciary chief, and a cleric from the Guardian Council if the supreme leader dies or is incapacitated until the regime selects a new one. The Guardian Council is a 12-person body responsible for vetting and approving electoral candidates and includes six clerics appointed by the supreme leader and six elected by Parliament. Ongoing deadlock over the succession could keep a leadership council in power for months or years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A leadership council would likely face similar challenges to a hardline supreme leader described above in trying to decisively lead the regime and mediate between its power centers.&lt;/strong&gt; This council would be inherently weak as councils almost always are and lack the legitimacy of a supreme leader to rule. The council would need to manage the extraordinarily influential IRGC and could struggle to command and constrain its military leadership, potentially giving the IRGC more latitude to pursue foreign adventurism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-infighting-and-violence&quot;&gt;3. Infighting and violence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The regime fails to agree on a new supreme leader, triggering infighting and violence.&lt;/strong&gt; Different actors such as the IRGC or a moderate-reformist bloc could mobilize supporters against one another and trigger protests, driving further instability and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario is similar to the second scenario in that it posits that the regime could not agree on the next supreme leader but includes possibly violent clashes between regime power centers. This scenario is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-a-moderate-or-reformist-cleric-succeeds-khamenei&quot;&gt;4. A moderate or reformist cleric succeeds Khamenei&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A moderate or reformist cleric becomes supreme leader through a peaceful and quick transition of power.&lt;/strong&gt; Such moderates and reformists include former President Hassan Rouhani and Hassan Khomeini — the grandson of the first supreme leader of Iran, Ruhollah Khomeini. This scenario is highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A moderate or reformist cleric such as Rouhani or Khomeini would likely preserve the fundamental structure and orientation of the regime but diverge in some key areas.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the primary divisions between hardliners and the moderate-reformist crowd is that the latter has historically promoted greater albeit still limited personal liberties and more relaxed censorship than hardliners. Most moderates and many reformists diverge from their hardliner counterparts much less on foreign policy and national security policy. Neither Rouhani nor Khomeini is likely to revise the Islamic Republic’s grand strategic objectives fundamentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A moderate or reformist supreme leader would face greater challenges than a hardline supreme leader in trying to cohere and unify the regime.&lt;/strong&gt; Moderates and reformists like Rouhani have a more adversarial relationship with the IRGC, which could challenge the IRGC’s entrenched influence within the regime. The IRGC waged a brutal if largely clandestine political struggle against Rouhani during Rouhani’s two presidential terms, periodically requiring Khamenei to intervene to stop the attacks. There is no reason to imagine that the IRGC’s dislike of Rouhani and his policies would abate just because Rouhani succeeded Khamenei. The IRGC’s hostility to Rouhani, personally, and to many of the policies that Khomeini has supported is one of the factors, indeed, that makes the prospect of either succeeding Khamenei remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-regime-change&quot;&gt;5. Regime Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread protests erupt and collapse the regime.&lt;/strong&gt; This scenario is distinct from scenario three in that it assumes that the regime elite remain relatively unified but face widespread popular unrest that they cannot control. Popular, anti-regime protests have grown in Iran since late 2017. Protests could reignite during a succession crisis and catalyze the collapse of the regime. This scenario is highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ali Khamenei’s death or removal as supreme leader is unlikely to meaningfully change the regime’s adversarial relationship with the US and its allies. A new supreme leader might even adopt a more aggressive stance towards the US, particularly if a hardliner succeeds Khamenei, which is the likeliest scenario. Supreme leader succession is unlikely to alter the Islamic Republic’s grand strategic objectives, but it will fundamentally change intra regime dynamics, presenting opportunities for new and existing power centers to usurp and consolidate influence in a post-Khamenei Islamic Republic. These dynamics will be worth observing as a new supreme leader attempts to preserve and expand on Khamenei’s legacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nicholas Carl and Kitaneh Fitzpatrick</name></author><summary type="html">This report presents five different scenarios that could emerge in a post-Khamenei Iran.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/CRBYx5j.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/CRBYx5j.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Renewing American Regime</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-09-12-renewing-american-regime.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Renewing American Regime" /><published>2022-09-12T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-09-12T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/renewing-american-regime</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-09-12-renewing-american-regime.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An insight of the broad sweep of America’s grand strategy in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine suggests that policymakers must remain committed to preserving U.S. hegemony in order to “shape evolving trends to its advantage.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine represents a painful blow to the international order. That a major power is seeking to change through the naked use of force what is a settled border guaranteed by previous interstate agreements and eviscerate an independent country threatens a return to the disorder that marked European history for centuries. It also represents a blatant challenge to the “liberal international order” that the United States has constructed since the end of World War II. This order represents an American regime insofar as it is grounded on Washington’s power, upon which the larger set of global rules, institutions, and patterned interactions survive. That power, in turn, is produced by an American regime at home: built upon strong individual rights, liberal democratic institutions, a sense of community, and free markets, the United States has furnished an example of how freedom and prosperity can be intimately intertwined to produce the material capabilities that are necessary to maintain a global order, which even as it serves American interests produces more benefits for others than any conceivable alternative. The external and internal faces of the American regime are, accordingly, mutually reinforcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energetic U.S.-led pushback against Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine is therefore essential both to protect the ordering superstructure that safeguards American security and to defend myriad concrete interests: assisting Ukraine’s defense represents a direct investment in protecting Europe — a core interest of the United States — especially when Putin’s ambitions to retrieve the lost Soviet empire portend further threats to U.S. allies. Simultaneously, it also signals Washington’s resolution to protect other critical interests in the face of the growing Chinese threats in Asia. These include the dangers posed to Taiwan — a state which, like Ukraine, is also viewed as having a problematic entitative status by its assailants — as well as to other U.S. allies and partners in the wider Indo-Pacific region. By thus protecting Europe and the Asian Rimland, the United States defends itself at a distance and thereby enables its own domestic regime to thrive within a secure geographic sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the same, the threats to the United States are legion. That they emerge concurrently from declining powers such as Russia and rising powers such as China confirms the expectation that, even when physical dangers are not at issue, U.S. hegemony is, and will be, threatened by multiple challenges. These encompass the perils posed by aggressive or reckless states, America’s relative decline in the face of diffusing power internationally, the spread of new technologies (including those that embody either new coercive potential or the promise of driving new economic revolutions within U.S. competitors), and the attacks on liberal ideas as ordering principles in national and international politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with these challenges, the United States cannot jettison its hegemonic role because doing so would deny it the freedom to shape evolving trends to its advantage. Nor can it settle for a strategy of selective disinterest because to do so would create opportunities for America’s rivals to exploit any abandonment of particular regions, institutions, or issue areas to Washington’s detriment. Consequently, the United States must reinvest in protecting its hegemony: it should strive to remain the largest single concentration of material power in the international system; it should protect its position as the most fecund center of technological innovation worldwide; it should retain the globe-girding military capabilities that underwrite its command of the commons and mark its superiority over its rivals; it should preserve its ideational and exemplary attractiveness because of their intrinsic merits, because they facilitate the production of material power, and because they enhance American influence abroad; and it should pursue a prudent strategic course that avoids squandering blood and treasure on causes that are peripheral to the maintenance of its power and influence and not overly injurious to the health of the international system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when U.S.-China competition is certain to dominate international politics for at least the next few decades, sustaining American hegemony promises to be the most effective strategy for coming out ahead in comparison to all the other alternatives, such as retreating to isolationism, fostering multipolarity, or hoping for the emergence of collective security arrangements. It also offers the best hope of limiting the dangers posed by the bipolarity that could emerge as a result of China’s rise. Nonetheless, it might seem odd that the preservation of American hegemony is defended here as a viable goal despite the larger realities of the country’s relative decline. After all, the U.S. share of the global economy has nearly halved since 1960 and today subsists at roughly a quarter of the world’s product in nominal terms. Although there is nothing in economic theory that suggests that the United States is perpetually locked into this fraction — after all, U.S. relative decline has in fact been slow, uneven, and caused mainly by developing countries growing faster (because they are much farther away from the global production-possibility frontier than the United States) — the goal of protecting American hegemony is nonetheless tenable despite its smaller share of the global product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;At a time when U.S.-China competition is certain to dominate international politics for at least the next few decades, sustaining American hegemony promises to be the most effective strategy for coming out ahead in comparison to all the other alternatives, such as retreating to isolationism, fostering multipolarity, or hoping for the emergence of collective security arrangements.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the annual output of the United States undeniably constitutes the foundations of its influence in the international system, the sources of its power extend beyond its economic capabilities. They include its unique geopolitical assets (such as alliances that add to U.S. capabilities while often freeing Washington to apply its own resources toward advancing its own particular interests); striking institutional dominance (which reflects a form of “structural power” that often and silently “decides outcomes — both positive and negative — much more than relational power does”); remarkable ideational attractiveness (which, as expressed through its political values, national culture, and global engagement, still remains extraordinarily appealing, despite recent battering); and, finally, unparalleled military capabilities (that permit the United States to enforce its will when necessary over the entire globe in a manner that no other state currently can). For all its relative decline, an outcome that has actually been fostered significantly by the success of the American regime abroad, the United States alone possesses — to use a Chinese term of art — “comprehensive national power.” When power is thus assessed in its multidimensionality, no other rival yet comes close, thus permitting the United States to viably maintain its hegemony should it so choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The character of American hegemony only makes this goal plausible. American hegemony, at least in the first instance, does not require Washington to enforce its control over the sovereignty of other states but rather to preserve an international order that fundamentally serves its core interests. This burden entails three different but complementary tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it involves preserving liberal democracy at home and abroad and promoting it as a universal ideal both because of its intrinsic value and because the expansion of the liberal democratic universe — with all its myriad associated regional and functional international institutions — protects American security and prosperity better than other alternative political orderings. This ambition is best advanced by exemplary conduct at home, though it must be supplemented by political engagement abroad. Whatever the means employed, the costs of supporting the entrenchment and the spread of liberal democracy and its associated institutions are modest and should rarely, if ever, require the use of deadly force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it involves upholding the open international economic order because ever-freer trade between states, when complemented by free and efficient markets at home, remains the best means of increasing universal (including American) prosperity. The United States has made unique contributions to creating such a global system in the postwar era. Continuing to sustain this order, again, requires primarily political engagement, which is not particularly costly in any pecuniary sense. To the degree that meaningful costs are entailed, these arise mainly in the distribution of relative gains between the United States and its trading partners, and Washington should not be shy about demanding greater reciprocity in its trade agreements, including by regulating access to its large and wealthy market as a means of securing enhanced market access in other countries. Negotiating these arrangements, however, does not impose any significant burdens on the U.S. Treasury, and because the United States is still largely a self-sufficient economy, the country can even bear significant trade losses, when necessary, with greater equanimity compared to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, and finally, it involves protecting the physical security of the United States and its many allies and partners around the world through a variety of instruments, not least of which is the military. This is the costliest of the three tasks, yet it remains the foundation on which the previous two responsibilities are discharged. Although fielding the military capabilities required to defend American interests — which also includes upholding the rules and institutions pertaining to international behavior — is expensive in absolute terms, the specific costs of defense and foreign policy lie well within the capacity of the American economy. The unnecessary frittering away of national resources on elective “wars of choice,” however, contributes more toward provoking domestic (and international) opposition to the American regime abroad than the responsible exercise of hegemony itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All told then, the United States must preserve its hegemony in the international system — meaning its leadership of the liberal order that flows from its unique concatenation of national and international power — simply because this positional ordering and the activities associated with sustaining this ordering best preserve its security, prosperity, and interests while also protecting its allies and friends worldwide. Because it is also affordable, the case for holding on to hegemony, rightly exercised, is all the more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The liberal international order created by American hegemony, undoubtedly, has universal aspirations. These hopes find reflection in the many international institutions that even non-liberal states find useful to participate in, even when they do not share the fundamental values animating these bodies. Despite such successes, the liberal international order, when conceived of as a Kantian “pacific union” of democratic states, is not yet (and may never become) a political macrocosm that is coterminous with the world itself. Consequently, it will remain under threat from without and, as recent Western experiences have illustrated, possibly also from within. The United States, accordingly, has to strengthen both the liberal foundations of its own polity, thus protecting the American regime at home, even as its partners work toward strengthening liberal democracy within their own countries. Simultaneously, the United States must reinvest — albeit in concert with its allies and friends — in indurating its own hegemony abroad because only American power can protect the existing liberal international order — the face of the American regime outside its borders — in exceptional ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near term, the most significant threat to this order is posed by China’s ascendency. This danger is far more consequential than even Russia’s invasion of Ukraine because it triply targets the universalist claims of liberal democracy, often exploits unfairly the opportunities afforded by the open trading system, and threatens the security of key American partners directly in the Indo-Pacific and, more indirectly, in Europe. Even more to the point, these dangers arise fundamentally from Beijing’s superior power and its still growing strength. While the United States must, therefore, defeat the Russian invasion of Ukraine in order to preserve good order both locally and internationally, it must concurrently gird its loins to meet the dangers posed by China, which will persist for many decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay explores what responding to the Chinese challenge entails in terms of the imperatives, opportunities, and risks facing the United States. Consistent with Andrew Marshall’s injunction to avoid the obvious and the immediate, the discussion that follows embeds the challenge of U.S.-China competition in a larger set of structural issues that must be engaged for success before turning to the more practical current problems that are associated with this rivalry. A discussion of these structural problems cannot be avoided because, although they seem far from the current war in Ukraine, they bear on the fundamental strategic challenges facing the United States, problems that have not been erased by Russia’s wanton aggression in any consequential ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;protecting-the-american-regime-abroad&quot;&gt;PROTECTING THE AMERICAN REGIME ABROAD&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preserving American hegemony entails preserving the liberal international order. The relationship between the two is dialectical. Without a powerful United States, the open international order cannot survive. Not only is no other nation capable or committed enough to substitute for the United States in preserving the liberal regime globally, but that order (despite its limitations) also cannot be maintained merely because other states also have a vested interest in its endurance. Although many states benefit from the liberal international order, the costs of preserving that order often exceed the gains accruing to any given state, thereby ensuring that weaker countries will not contribute enough to preserving the system that they most profit from — thus ensuring its enervation and eventually its demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only an enormously well-endowed state, what Mancur Olson famously called in another context a “privileged” provider, can bear these “uncovered” costs of system maintenance, and the United States has done so since the end of World War II because a liberal international order is fundamentally in American self-interest. A flourishing liberal order, fundamentally grounded in a Kantian “respect for persons,” diminishes the threats that could arise against the United States; it spawns allies whose interests are served by bandwagoning with a powerful protector (while concurrently providing national contributions) against those perils that may threaten the liberal coalition (as the Soviet Union once did during the Cold War); and it creates opportunities for increasing prosperity both within the United States and among its liberal partners insofar as it expands the opportunities for deeper specialization that arises from free trade. For all these reasons, the open international order contributes toward enhancing American security and affluence, and to the degree that it cements a coalition of capable and reliable partners who share both interests and values, it also congeals American hegemony and bolsters its capacity to deal with diverse threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upholding the liberal order to protect U.S. interests, however, requires consistent attention by Washington because hegemonic stability is not automatically self-sustaining. It requires investments and attention on the part of the hegemon if the outcomes of peace and stability are to obtain. Equally, it requires statesmanship, that is, the virtue of possessing a “comprehensive or ‘architectonic’ perspective” so that the wisest course of action, invariably rooted in moderation, may be discerned in order to keep “an oft-times rattled humanity from seeking, sometimes with the encouragement of very great thinkers, the (false) comfort of various extremes.” Therefore, protecting the liberal order — and even more so the quest to enlarge it — perpetually requires prudent statecraft that is sensitive to the costs and benefits of various political choices when considered against the widest “stream of contingencies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Upholding the liberal order to protect U.S. interests, however, requires consistent attention by Washington because hegemonic stability is not automatically self-sustaining.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the last two decades have not witnessed this kind of statesmanship consistently, and as a result, American hegemony has faltered at great cost both to the United States and to the credibility of its international order. The arrival of the unipolar moment after the end of the Cold War should have been a golden opportunity for the consolidation of American global hegemony. And in the 1990s, it seemed as if this objective might have been within reach because U.S. power seemed unrivaled and its international stature unchallenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that slowly changed after the new millennium began. The hopes for a liberal democratic Russia gradually dissolved amid the rise of a revanchist Putin regime. Believing that “the demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,” Putin set out to retrieve whatever remnants of the erstwhile Soviet empire he could through a combination of “gray-zone” aggression or simple usurpation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about the same time, China emerged on the international scene as a new great power. Thanks to its deep integration within the global trading system — while resolutely remaining a model of state capitalism — China gradually became “the new workshop of the world” and used its growing economic power to steadily build a formidable military machine. The advent of Xi Jinping energized the ambition of restoring China’s historical greatness, which engendered the goal of transforming Beijing’s military capabilities into “world-class forces” by mid-century. As part of this “rejuvenation,” Xi — although more subtly than Putin — also began to implement a new assertive foreign policy that included renewed confrontations with China’s neighbors, increased territorial aggrandizement, and bold demands for a “new type of great-power relationship” that entailed Washington’s recognition of China’s parity with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States failed to mount an adequate response to these challenges. Although the George W. Bush administration had perceived China’s emergence as a great-power rival clearly, it was misled by Putin and, worse, was distracted by the militarized global war on terror that ensued after the 9/11 attacks on the United States. The two-decade-long campaign in Afghanistan that followed ultimately failed because Washington pursued a flawed, and visibly self-defeating, strategy. But even this setback paled in comparison to the financial, human, and reputational losses ensuing from the U.S. invasion of Iraq, which arguably will be judged by history not merely as a colossal political misjudgment but also as an utterly expensive and unnecessary one. It cast a shadow over Bush’s other achievements and, more corrosively, sapped the nation’s appetite for undertaking those hegemonic responsibilities that might legitimately require the use of force. It also fueled the calls for “restraint” that now mark the unholy marriage of the American right and the American left on the core question of grand strategy, namely, how should the United States conduct itself in the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressures for retrenchment were exacerbated by the global financial crisis that originated in the United States and consumed Barack Obama’s first term in office. Disenchanted with Bush’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and facing a severe economic crisis, Obama sought to exit both conflicts in order to “reinvest at home.” He also sought to negotiate with adversaries (even if it meant alienating friends) while seeking to minimize any external activism that would require the use of force. Accordingly, he risked discrediting U.S. hegemonic stability when he reneged on his threat to bomb Syria after Bashar al-Assad had crossed his own “redline” against using chemical weapons, when he settled on a “too slow and too incremental” response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and when he failed to confront Beijing’s militarization of the South China Sea. On all these counts, Obama’s reluctance was largely shaped by the apparent economic and political constraints facing the United States, but it did not reflect a desire to simply abjure either traditional U.S. internationalism or U.S. global leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His successor, Donald Trump, however, seemed to have little interest in either. Radically departing from Washington’s postwar commitment to uphold the American regime, Trump declared his fealty to protecting U.S. interests narrowly conceived and nothing beyond. On the strength of a populist nationalism at home, Trump promised to safeguard American security but was opposed to the burdens of defending its allies; he sought increased prosperity but despised the multilateral trading system as the means to that end; and he had little time for defending liberal values either at home or abroad. Although Trump did the nation and the international system a favor by calling China out as a strategic competitor — which his predecessors had studiously avoided — his presidency marked the most serious crisis facing the American regime not just because he reneged on diverse U.S. international commitments but because he disavowed these obligations as a matter of principle even as he was busy destroying American democracy at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suspicion that the United States might be losing its liberal credentials thus intensified, but from the perspective of the international system, the fear that it might be tiring — and might actually be incapable — of bearing the burdens of global leadership further solidified. That American democracy survived despite Trump’s bruising is ultimately a testament to the resilience of its political mores. And that the United States continued to maintain the international order in the face of Trump’s disinterest, if not animosity, is partly a function of path dependency and equally a tribute to some of his officials who fought rearguard actions internally to prevent a comprehensive retrenchment that would have destroyed it irreparably. Without these guardrails, the consequences of his convulsive term in office might have been even greater. His successor, Joe Biden, promises a return to traditional American internationalism and hegemonic leadership, but it will require many years of success to prove that the United States has the capacity and will to discharge these responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two decades have thus been marked by dramatic oscillations in regard to American efforts at protecting the liberal international order. From the high point of Bush’s energetic, though sometimes misdirected, and often costly activism, the pendulum has progressively swung since in the opposite direction, with Trump’s term representing the nadir as far as the acceptance of hegemonic responsibilities is concerned. For all the pressures to retreat, however, it is not obvious that the United States will enhance its security, increase its prosperity, or strengthen the international order against its adversaries by pursuing such a course. One close reading of the larger postwar historical record in fact notes that although retrenchment has been a regular antidote to U.S. foreign policy excesses, only the “maximalist” exercise of U.S. leadership has “kept American adversaries permanently under pressure and on the defensive, limited their influence, challenged their legitimacy, and tipped the balance of power in the right direction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this implies that the United States should behave like a bull in a china shop, but a committed and judicious hegemony that applies American power appropriately to a prioritized set of critical objectives promises greater benefits for American interests than a restraint that assumes that the international system will provide gains for the United States equally well without Washington’s consistent management. The onset of real multipolarity will not make things any better because the threat of constantly revolving coalitions only increases the likelihood of buck passing, and collective security arrangements that are not underwritten by a single hegemonic power or by a small group of powerful states that share both interests and values are simply likely to be stillborn. Only a concerted effort to protect American hegemony can in fact ward off the emergent arrival of bipolarity, but even if that is not possible, the investments made toward that end remain the best guarantee that the bipolarity arising with China’s arrival as a superpower will not fundamentally undermine the American international regime in ways that threaten the interests of the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A committed and judicious hegemony that applies American power appropriately to a prioritized set of critical objectives promises greater benefits for American interests than a restraint that assumes that the international system will provide gains for the United States equally well without Washington’s consistent management.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;protecting-the-american-regime-at-home&quot;&gt;PROTECTING THE AMERICAN REGIME AT HOME&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If preserving the liberal international order requires American hegemony for its success and vice versa, protecting American hegemony requires attention equally to matters at home. The relationship between the successful exercise of hegemony abroad and the condition of America’s domestic polity is not anchored merely in exemplary considerations. It is widely appreciated that a vibrant American democracy validates U.S. credentials when promoting liberal values abroad; it serves as an important instrument of American soft power; and it functions as proof that countries do not need authoritarian regimes in order to nurture economic success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the success of the American democratic experiment — the internal face of the American regime — is equally essential for more substantive reasons. If there is anything that the Trump years taught the international community about the United States, it is that all claims about the American commitment to sustain its hegemonic responsibilities will always be suspect if they are not corroborated by evidence that the populace supports this role. Even today, Biden’s assurances that “America is back,” though welcomed by U.S. allies, are still met with skepticism because of the uncertainties surrounding their strength and durability. After all, as long as there remains a non-trivial possibility that Trump might return to office as quickly as two years from now, and the striking divisions in American politics exist plainly for all to see, the fears that domestic developments will undermine Washington’s capacity to play its traditional hegemonic role corrosively threaten confidence in the stability of the American regime abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preserving the success of the liberal international order, therefore, requires attending to the health of American domestic politics along three dimensions: overcoming the extant polarization; addressing slowing domestic social mobility; and reimagining the American experiment as a pursuit of the common good. These tasks are enormous and involve fundamental transformations that transcend the life of any single administration. Moreover, they are not easily susceptible to quick success through discrete policies. Yet engaging them is essential, if the United States is to avoid the danger of losing its hegemony, not because of weakening capabilities but because its domestic preferences about protecting the American regime abroad may have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overcoming the polarization that currently ails American democracy is a fearsome challenge for a polity that is marked by “a deep divide between two dominant visions for the country, one progressive and the other conservative.” No easy exits appear in sight, but the element that matters importantly for the U.S. ability to uphold the hegemonic order concerns the breakdown in the domestic coalitions that traditionally supported an activist U.S. international role. While American internationalists can be counted on to support the exercise of U.S. hegemonic responsibilities (even if there are differences on specific policies), the critical swing constituency remain the nationalists (if truly diehard isolationists are excluded). In general, the nationalists are willing to make great sacrifices to directly protect U.S. security but are less persuaded of the need to uphold the American world order as a means to that end. Partly because the benefits of that order have never been as transparently clear as its costs, partly because many citizens have lost out economically as a result of the globalization engendered by American hegemony, and partly because key electorally important constituencies find themselves culturally alienated from their internationalist peers, reenlisting the broad support of the citizenry for Washington’s exercise of hegemony remains a critical element of maintaining the American regime abroad. Overcoming the current fragmentation (and sometimes alienation) is equally critical to protect liberal democracy at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This task was simpler when the Soviet Union threatened the United States and its diverse allies directly with military instruments. The threats posed by China are often more subtle and the issues that dominate the competition with the United States will frequently be more rarified, which makes the task of mobilizing a strong, resilient, and unified domestic base of support more challenging but nonetheless just as critical as it was during the Cold War. At a time when the temptation for many Americans to support isolationism is real — because the domestic problems are not insignificant — doubling down on the effort to persuade them that American security is intimately linked not merely to the absence of direct threats but rather to the viability of its primacy itself is both necessary and urgent. Because of the failures of the last two decades, this task will be challenging, but it can be achieved. In part, this is because the burdens of exercising American hegemony routinely are actually quite modest and largely involve sunk costs. Moreover, the body politic at large is usually content to defer to elites on the broad direction of national strategy, and as long as the chosen course does not precipitate costly and unsuccessful wars, whose aims are hard to discern when matched against popular understandings of the national interest, American citizens are content to support (or at least are not opposed to) the international leadership that is exercised on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the same, making the case for the benefits of continued American hegemony remains an important responsibility for holders of public office. Despite the deep divides on many issues of national politics, it is possible to construct a minimal bipartisan consensus on the importance of preserving U.S. leadership, especially when the dangers that appear far away today could quickly come home to threaten the United States if not confronted. Communicating this reality obviously requires statesmanship, deliberation, and thoughtful communication, and both the executive and legislative branches have important roles to play in this regard. Because it is likely, as past history suggests, that problems not averted often precipitate national overreactions that prove far more costly in retrospect, it is necessary to persuade the polity that steady U.S. global leadership is a much more responsible and economical way of protecting its interests. To the degree that material deprivation contributes toward the alienation of some citizens, amelioration by concerted state intervention also becomes indispensable to remedy the immiseration and thereby bolster support for broader U.S. international engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because competitive international politics is an elite rather than a mass interest, it may appear as if working to buttress the domestic foundations of support for U.S. hegemony is not particularly important. After all, Trump was able to pursue contradictory policies — disrupting the international order while cozying up to Russia and China before he eventually confronted the latter — with nary a peep from his populist base. The danger, however, is less that a mass upsurge will force changes in U.S. external obligations from below. Rather, an unpersuaded populace could easily validate a future decision by an idiosyncratic president or an irresponsible legislature to walk away from protecting the American regime abroad at great long-term cost to the nation. Strengthening the domestic consensus to overcome polarization on at least this count offers the hope that the United States will be able to consistently protect the liberal international order that serves its interests — while conveying that resolve credibly to friends, adversaries, and bystanders alike. If the country can at the same time stay reliably liberal and democratic as well, these commitments will only enjoy greater confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of securing broad domestic support for a grand strategy centered on preserving the American regime abroad will not succeed if that order does not provide sufficient material benefits for the populace, especially to those constituencies whose political support is necessary to uphold it. The open international economic system engendered by U.S. power fostered a productive wave of globalization that increased aggregate U.S. growth as well as the growth of many other countries, including U.S. competitors such as China. What globalization failed to do, however, was to ensure equitable growth within national boundaries — as indeed it naturally cannot. That responsibility falls upon national governments. The United States is particularly susceptible on this count because it lacks the strong social safety nets found within its G7 partners and because its culture of “social Spencerism” often prevents the state from undertaking extensive corrective economic remediation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The aim of securing broad domestic support for a grand strategy centered on preserving the American regime abroad will not succeed if that order does not provide suff icient material benef its for the populace, especially to those constituencies whose political support is necessary to uphold it.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the United States has avoided acute societal instability in part because of the remarkable absence of social envy despite sharp economic inequalities, which are among the highest in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) network. The elevated levels of economic freedom in the United States have in fact ensured that the popular “attitudes towards the rich are . . . more positive.” In other words, even poorer Americans, far from despising the wealthy, actually seek to emulate their achievements. This outlook is grounded in the conviction that wealth is invariably a reward for hard work and that social mobility awaits those who make the necessary effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence, however, refutes this mythology. The United States actually offers less social mobility than many of its European peers, Australia, and Japan, subsisting below the OECD average. In the United States, as in other peers with restricted mobility, the quality of one’s parents’ education, their socio-economic status, and in general one’s economic endowments at birth still seems to bear heavily on the reproduction of inequality and stunted mobility. This means that many poorer Americans are unlikely to enjoy as much social mobility as the American dream implies because their parents’ lower earnings and lower education often combine with constrained occupational status and sometimes substandard health to prevent them from climbing the social ladder as their wealthier peers, who profit from the increased embeddedness of the United States in the globalized world, can more easily do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because spreading economic opportunity more widely remains a necessary — even if not a sufficient — instrument for securing mass support for a policy of hegemonic leadership, U.S. internationalists must first pursue sensible macroeconomic policies at home. As part of this endeavor, Washington must focus on investing more in human capital, increasing retraining and employment mobility, rectifying the tax system, and providing expanded and more efficient public services. Absent such investments, the incentives for ordinary Americans to consistently support a grand strategy centered on the maintenance of U.S. primacy will be weak or precarious. To its credit, the Biden administration has begun to move in this direction, but its work here is far from complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, renewing the American regime at home by recentering its political life on the pursuit of the common good is long overdue for both instrumental and substantive reasons. The challenges here cannot be overstated. The Founding Fathers created a constitutional system that was competitive by design and characterized by divided government, which served as a perpetual “invitation to struggle for the privilege of directing . . . policy.” The domestic economy was similarly structured as a competitive system where utility- and profit-maximizing entities jostled in the marketplace and thereby helped to create the most productive system witnessed in history. For all of its failures regarding equitable distribution and the production of collective goods, the free market system has provided an effective solution to scarcity because the impersonal bargains struck among numerous interacting agents generate effective cooperation out of competitive maximizing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political marketplace, in contrast, appears to be dreadfully battered because the rise of absolutist “winner take all” politics in recent years has undermined the fundamental necessity of deliberation and compromise while corroding the overarching idea of community that is essential to limit and regulate what otherwise becomes destructive rivalry. The reasons for this turn of events are multitudinous: the capture of the primary system by ideologues, the diminishing ideational diversity within political parties, the vehemently adversarial competition between Democrats and Republicans, the corrupting role of money in electoral competition, the paralyzing effects of divided government, and the rise of a highly partisan and combative media — not to mention technological innovations that permit the rapid dissemination and amplification of falsehoods — have all been identified as reasons for the growing crisis of governability. Compounding these factors is a more dangerous trend toward reimagining the meaning of citizenship itself away from the sworn commitment to the Constitution and its obligations to something grounded more on a racial or cultural inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these forces have bolstered a politics where the ambitions of a part have overwhelmed the good of the whole. The relentless competition between different social constituencies, as reflected in contemporary party politics, is no longer anchored in a desire to promote “the happiness or flourishing of the community, the well-ordered life in the polis” but merely the private benefits accruing to certain constituencies. As a result, when neither party enjoys complete dominance over the legislative and executive branches, it is difficult to pass any legislation that advances the national interest. And if one party comes to possess such dominance episodically, the legitimacy of the laws enacted during that time is continually challenged to the detriment of the country as a whole. The collapse of bipartisanship, which can only survive if there is a commitment to the common good, thus does not augur well for the coming competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution to this challenge at the simplest level requires the American polity to rediscover the meaning of those “three fateful words: We the people.” But as Willian Galston has argued correctly, internalizing this vision presumes that “the people who form it [this community] must want to live together as a unity, and they must think of themselves as sharing a common fate.” If this quest is not to end in a voluntarist or psychological morass, perhaps the only way forward is to consider structural changes that would allow citizens to convey their preferences more accurately and to increase the possibilities of compromise. Toward these ends, institutional reforms that could help a rediscovery of the common good might include the use of ranked-choice voting; the prevention of gerrymandering to create more competitive election districts; changes to the structure of primary elections; election finance reform to minimize reliance on opaque soft money provided by special interests; and better intraparty processes for choosing presidential nominees. None of these solutions guarantees that the United States will recover its founding vision of building a united political community, but absent such structural changes, the quest for the common good will perpetually remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to dismiss such concerns on the ground that issues of foreign policy and national defense invariably summon cooperation across the aisle and across different branches of government. But such successes are insufficient. The ongoing rivalry with China will be a long and extended contestation that plays out not over years but decades. Unlike the Soviet Union, China promises to emerge as a genuine peer competitor with broad economic, technological, and military strengths rivaling that of the United States. This Sino-American face-off, accordingly, will not involve merely competitive decisions pertaining to foreign policy and national defense but rather the entire gamut of societal and state power. In such circumstances, it will be poor consolation if the cross-party solidarity that might be manifested currently on strategic issues does not extend to strengthening the American polity as a whole: making the right social, economic, and political decisions that enable the entire citizenry — and not just some faction — to realize its highest potential — the common good — and thereby contribute toward generating the requisite levels of national power that permit Washington to comfortably maintain the American regime at home and abroad despite the myriad emerging challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It will be poor consolation if the cross-party solidarity that might be manifested currently on strategic issues does not extend to strengthening the American polity as a whole.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preparing-for-us-china-competition-today&quot;&gt;PREPARING FOR U.S.-CHINA COMPETITION TODAY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a painful reminder that the use of force is well and alive in international politics. Yet because China, unlike Russia, is certain to emerge as a much more dangerous rival than the Soviet Union ever was, the United States has to prepare for this competition by preserving the advantages it currently enjoys — the management of an international system that reflects its interests, the possession of a highly productive economy, its preeminence in innovation and technology, and its formidable military forces — while correcting those weaknesses that are visible both at home and abroad. There are three activities that are especially relevant in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mobilizing-coalitions-to-meet-the-chinese-challenge&quot;&gt;MOBILIZING COALITIONS TO MEET THE CHINESE CHALLENGE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has had a remarkably good record of managing hegemony in comparison to previous great powers, the doubts that have arisen in recent years about its capacity and commitment to responsible global leadership need to be allayed. For starters, this requires recognizing that global leadership means leading not just on issues that matter narrowly to Washington, which understandably will receive priority, but on all major concerns that affect the larger international community as a whole. Taking the lead to solve global collective action problems, such as climate change, the threat of pandemics, the organization of global trade, and the protection of the commons, permits the United States to address problems that matter to its own security and prosperity while simultaneously building a variety of coalitions that will also matter on the narrower issues of U.S.-China competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond collective action problems, the demands of global leadership do not imply that all parts of the world require equal or coordinate importance. In fact, prioritizing where the United States allocates resources toward solving the problems of high politics will be essential for success in an environment where both material capabilities and leadership attention are obviously limited in comparison to the demand for them. Moreover, the choice of instruments is equally pertinent: military forces are the most precious resources that must be husbanded for dealing with threats that cannot be neutralized by other means. Utilizing diplomacy, international institutions, and economic instruments are invariably to be preferred whenever possible over the employment of force — and especially in parts of the world where the United States has only secondary interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When American interests are assessed across the globe, there are three areas of critical priority: the American homeland and the wider Western Hemisphere, the Indo-Pacific region, and the European continent are intrinsically valuable to the United States; the Middle East is extrinsically valuable and U.S. interests there consist mainly of preventing competitors from controlling the energy reserves and subverting the stability and security of the regional states. Again, even in these vital theaters, diplomacy must be the instrument of first resort, albeit backed up by effective military capabilities. While the United States will remain engaged in other parts of the world, they do not justify any extraordinary expenditure of U.S. resources, though Washington should, and will, work with other allies to address challenges as they arise in these regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where U.S.-China competition is concerned, the obligations of global leadership translate into two specific and challenging projects: encouraging greater European responsibility for their own defense while integrating their support toward addressing the China challenge; and sustaining a capable coalition of Asian states to effectively balance against Beijing. Recognizing that globalization — however, weakened since the global financial crisis — is not disappearing and will not disappear short of systemic war because the forces of international capitalism cannot be constrained except by serious great-power conflict implies that China will remain enmeshed in dense economic ties both with the United States and with its allies in Europe and Asia (and with many other countries worldwide). Despite that fact, Washington has to mobilize coalitions of partners that are capable and willing to resist Chinese assertiveness and confront it with military instruments if that proves to be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States already has a network of allies that constitutes the nucleus of such a response. But this network is neither mature nor flexible enough to respond to the possible challenges posed by China. Of all the alliance agreements that the United States has entered into during the postwar period, only the Rio Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty (which established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]) are collective defense agreements: they commit all members to come to the defense of each other if one of them is attacked. The other agreements, such as bilateral treaties with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and Australia and New Zealand (ANZUS), either bind the United States to come to the defense of its allies (without reciprocity necessarily) or trigger a collective response only if aggression occurs within certain specified geographic areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that any Chinese aggression will materialize in the coming decade in the Western Hemisphere in ways that justify collective defense under the Rio Treaty. But a major war over Taiwan could occur in Asia during this timeframe, one that could implicate NATO automatically while pressuring at least Japan, South Korea, and Australia. The problem for NATO, however, is that although an attack on the United States or U.S. forces in Asia could trigger the alliance’s collective defense obligations, NATO’s European members are neither militarily threatened by China nor are their armed forces configured to deal with the geographically distant Chinese threat in a way that the United States already is on both counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the first task for the United States is to aid NATO in operationalizing an effective response to the “systemic challenges” posed by China to the alliance, even if the latter cannot be expected to make countering China its principal responsibility. In fact, NATO’s European constituents could make a significant contribution to U.S. security in Asia by doing what they can do best: assuming primary responsibility for protecting their continent’s and its immediate environs’ security in order to enable Washington to free up military resources currently earmarked for Europe to support potential operations in Asia. This does not involve any strategic decoupling between the United States and Europe: the collective defense obligations of both would remain intact, but there would be a better division of labor, with the European allies taking point for European defense and the United States offering backup, while the United States takes point in Asia with NATO providing backup as necessary. Implementing this vision will require greater European investments in defense, a promise that has surfaced (even if not yet fructified) in the aftermath of Russia’s Ukraine invasion. And it will also require a more resolute European commitment to take high politics seriously — as Joseph Borrell put it, to “relearn the language of power” — in contrast to past practices where Europe busied itself with profitable low politics while leaving the United States to bear the disproportionate burden for ensuring its security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NATO’s European constituents could make a signif icant contribution to U.S. security in Asia by doing what they can do best: assuming primary responsibility for protecting their continent’s and its immediate environs’ security in order to enable Washington to free up military resources currently earmarked for Europe to support potential operations in Asia.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the new division of labor, however, the European allies can make an equally significant contribution by pressing back on the dangers now posed by China. Beijing today is more than just a systemic challenger to NATO: it is already a tacit threat. Consequently, Washington needs to work with NATO, the European Union, and European capitals to encourage greater European investments not just in military modernization but especially in monitoring and mitigating the risks arising from Chinese investment, technology, and the threats to intellectual property; increasing the resilience of European defense supply chains; improving cybersecurity assurance in the face of dangers to critical infrastructure; and increasing transatlantic cooperation to protect the global commons. The remarkable Chinese intimidation of Lithuania already previews what will be Europe’s future — even as Beijing continues to lure and divide European societies and nations by access to its markets and the benefits of its outward investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transformations in the West need to be complemented by greater attention to the East. For the foreseeable future, China will remain the most significant challenger to U.S. hegemony globally and especially in Asia. This does not imply that Washington must focus on Asia to the neglect of the rest of the world, but it does require keeping developments in Asia at the front and center of U.S. strategic consciousness. The Asian continent already hosts the most troublesome states for U.S. interests — China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran — but the problems that will be posed by China along the Asian Rimland are in a class by themselves. In fact, if Washington can adequately meet this challenge, the other contingencies will devolve into “lesser included cases” subsumed by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second task, then, consists of deepening and even transforming America’s key Asian alliances to confront the wider regional challenges posed by China’s assertiveness. Washington in recent years has sensibly doubled down on investing in a coalitional strategy, and its investments in resurrecting the Quad are a good step in this direction. But the Quad is likely to be most effective mainly in diplomatic coordination and delivering public goods within the region and elsewhere. It is unlikely to be involved qua Quad in any military defense against Chinese aggression. Only the U.S. alliances with Japan and Australia will probably be relevant here. While both these alliance partners enjoy close security cooperation with the United States, neither is automatically obliged to come to U.S. aid if they are not attacked in crisis (although both will probably be involved in U.S. military operations out of choice, depending on the character of the contingency).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington has worked with each partner individually — as each has with the others — to deepen strategic cooperation, but what is still missing is a unified mesh architecture that binds all three nations in the service of cooperative defense. Moreover, Japan and Australia still have significant shortfalls in military capabilities that prevent them from assisting the United States in ways that would be necessary in the event of any conflict with China. In any event, even if a formal collective defense obligation between the three nations is beyond reach during this decade, there is compelling necessity for all three states to initiate collaborative defense planning at the strategic and operational levels, develop mutual access arrangements, conduct rotational deployments at each other’s facilities, and pursue cooperation in logistics, communications, force interoperability, and weapons development and acquisitions. Such structured collaboration would provide the United States as well as its partners greater opportunities to express the political solidarity necessary to signal resolve in peacetime while ensuring the generation, posturing, and operationalization of capabilities that are essential during conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These capabilities are most likely to be tested in a U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan — a possibility that is increasingly realistic because Beijing does not seem content to live with the current status quo indefinitely. Given this change in Chinese attitude under Xi Jinping, Washington needs to urgently assess the merits of persisting with its current policy of strategic ambiguity. This approach made sense when the United States sought to deter both the Chinese use of force and the possibility of provocative Taiwanese actions toward independence simultaneously. Today, when the military balance in the Taiwan Strait has evolved decisively in favor of China, Taipei is unlikely to aggravate China in ways that were previously feared (and this danger can be minimized in any case by private admonitions to Taipei about the limits of U.S. commitment in the face of any destabilizing Taiwanese behaviors). If the current separation of Taiwan from China is judged to be in U.S. interest — and there are persuasive arguments for this conclusion — then Washington ought to shift toward a policy of strategic clarity, namely, transparently conveying that any Chinese use of force against Taiwan would be met by a U.S. military response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If deterring Chinese aggression against Taiwan remains the most pressing strategic danger in East Asia, then preventing this outcome demands a clear commitment that the United States will come to Taiwan’s defense in a crisis. Obviously, it also requires Washington — and Taipei — to build up the necessary military capabilities to make such a commitment viable. What should be corrected, therefore, is the current course, which has taken the United States in the direction of aiding Taiwan through arms transfers, joint training, and diplomatic support but without any clear-cut assurance of defending it in the event of a Chinese attack. The lessons of Ukraine are instructive here: NATO’s commitment at the Bucharest summit to consider Ukrainian membership eventually proved provocative enough for Russia to attack Ukraine with the aim of erasing its political existence and thereby stalling its integration with the West. The growing U.S. assistance to Taiwan could prove to be a similar affront if it persuades Xi Jinping that the bolstering of de facto Taiwanese independence must be forcibly arrested before it is too late. Averting this cataclysm in the context of growing U.S.-China rivalry increasingly suggests that Washington should strengthen deterrence not simply by assisting Taiwan — as it is already doing — but by clearly signaling to China that any aggression against the island would be resisted by U.S. military power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If deterring Chinese aggression against Taiwan remains the most pressing strategic danger in East Asia, then preventing this outcome demands a clear commitment that the United States will come to Taiwan’s defense in a crisis.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pursuing-sensible-external-economic-engagement&quot;&gt;PURSUING SENSIBLE EXTERNAL ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While course corrections at the geopolitical level are essential for success in the evolving U.S.-China competition, similar shifts must occur in regard to fortifying the nation’s productive base, a task that is fundamentally under Washington’s own control and not dependent on the choices made by other countries. Because the issues involved here have been discussed at length elsewhere, the following discussion will concentrate only on the nation’s trade strategies, which have unfortunately become more controversial in recent years than they should be. The adjustments in the U.S. approach to trade should be pursued not merely because they bear on American prosperity — which is clearly an intrinsic good — but equally because they affect Washington’s ability to compete with Beijing: a sensible trade policy increases U.S. national power, contributes toward the maintenance of U.S. leadership in the international system, and shapes the calculations of other nations who rely on trade more than the United States does and whose partnership will be necessary for American success in the ongoing rivalry with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues of trade strategy, ordinarily, should not be big concerns for the United States because its large and open domestic economy is less trade sensitive for its growth. Even so, Washington has, since the beginning of the postwar era, invested heavily in building and maintaining an ever more open international trading system in order to enlarge global prosperity and reduce international instability. Ever since China’s entry into this regime, however, the costs of asymmetrical U.S. economic openness have weighed heavily on American policymakers. These concerns peaked during the Trump administration when the president, who was antagonistic toward multilateral trade long before he entered office, sought to gut the global trading system through the imposition of widespread tariffs on allies and adversaries alike. This approach, which was supposed to correct the failures of the global trading system, was quixotic because the evolution of cross-border supply chains rendered any strategy centered on engineering bilateral trade agreements as a substitute hopelessly inappropriate. It had the effect of not only undermining the traditional U.S. leadership in multilateral trade but also strengthening global perceptions of American unreliability, especially in Asia and Europe, where trade is a critical driver of growth, while permitting China to pose as a more constructive and often more valuable partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has corrected some of Trump’s excesses, but it appears to share many of his fears about the deleterious consequences of trade on American prosperity. One scholar, in fact, described “Biden’s trade policy to be Trump’s without the tweets.” Achieving success in the U.S.-China competition requires the United States to make multiple course corrections on trade issues. For starters, Washington needs to renew its support for the World Trade Organization (WTO) by at the very least permitting the appointment of new judges to its Appellate Body. Global trade reform through the WTO is invariably painful, but as the latest ministerial in Geneva proved, incremental progress is possible despite the agony, and, at any rate, there are no alternatives to the WTO where regulating global trade is concerned. The United States obviously benefits directly from the existence of a robust multilateral trading system, but even if the rewards to itself are more modest — because U.S. trade-to-GDP ratios are much lower than the global average — its support for the WTO represents an example of enlightened hegemony insofar as U.S. leadership here provides gains for others that could pay back in terms of strengthened geopolitical cooperation. Neither political party in the United States today, however, seems committed to expanding international trade. Yet disregarding trade is a good way to lose friends and influence at a time when China has become the primary trading partner of the largest number of countries globally and has exploited that connectivity to shape both their economic and strategic choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Achieving success in the U.S.-China competition requires the United States to make multiple course corrections on trade issues&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current U.S. disenchantment with trade is obviously shaped by multiple concerns: trade losses suffered by important domestic constituencies, constrained market access abroad, and relative gains advantages accruing to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trade losses suffered either sectorally or regionally as a result of “the China shock” obviously have serious implications in U.S. domestic politics, but such outcomes are bound to occur as a natural consequence of international trade itself. Less efficient producers go out of business as a consequence of exchange across borders, yet this outcome is compensated by the increased aggregate benefit to society as a whole. Mitigating these losses requires private producers to invest in increasing competitiveness and the state to assist these efforts through broader macroeconomic reforms and adjustment programs, thereby enabling those populations affected by trade losses to survive in the face of the dislocations. The United States, unfortunately, failed in regard to supporting adjustment in recent decades, but refusing to expand trade because of these shortcomings amounts to throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Moreover, if U.S. trade losses are caused by unfair trade practices, then these problems must be addressed by state action either bilaterally or preferably multilaterally — and this is where the U.S. dismay with the WTO Appellate Body has only contributed toward further weakening the global trading system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems of constrained market access abroad also have to be remedied by national negotiations either bilaterally or multilaterally. The WTO has proved irritatingly slow on this count, but the current U.S. circumspection in considering any more bilateral trade agreements has unfortunately cut off the other avenue by which the United States could gain new markets. Because the U.S. economy is already more open than most, bilateral trading agreements are especially beneficial for the United States. The fear that new trade agreements may be bad politics domestically, however, has resulted in constraining this option right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of relative gains also has to be addressed in different ways. The biggest problem for the United States presently on this count is China. Most of China’s trade gains in the last several decades, however, have accrued through cost advantages — the benefits of being a cheap, yet high-quality, manufacturer. These are entirely legitimate gains. The extent of the illegitimate gains is harder to quantify: these arise from the theft of intellectual property or its coercive extraction in exchange for market access, significant governmental subsidies provided to private or public enterprises, the manipulation of exchange rates, unfair practices such as dumping, or state-driven strategies focused on cornering market share by eliminating foreign competitors. Washington historically has been reluctant to confront Beijing about these behaviors in part because U.S. businesses were afraid that any confrontation with China would make life difficult for their own commercial operations within the country. The Trump administration finally changed course in this regard, but its solutions — increased tariffs to stimulate greater Chinese purchases of American goods — were hardly appropriate to the larger problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerted action to address these issues has still proven to be elusive in Washington, but the one solution that the United States slowly gravitated toward — creating partial free trade agreements (PFTAs) centered on high standards among a small group of partners — is also in limbo. The Trump administration walked out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the most important PFTA negotiated in recent years, although by the time Trump did so, the Democratic Party also had soured on this accord. The benefit of PFTAs, such as the TPP, is that they would have allowed the United States and its partners to enjoy heightened trade gains among themselves, thereby offsetting some of the losses suffered as a result of trade with China, while institutionalizing new, higher-standard trade rules that would have reduced the cost benefits accruing to countries such as China because of their weaker labor and environmental standards. U.S. domestic politics, however, has prevented the Biden administration from considering rejoining the TPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this matters for two critical reasons. First, the U.S. absence from the TPP, which represents enhanced trade integration in Asia, coincides with the heightened Chinese interest in binding other Asian states more deeply into its own economy, an ambition signaled both by its own lower-quality Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement — today, the world’s biggest trade deal — and now its new interest in joining the TPP at a time when the United States itself seems content to stay out. At a time when U.S.-China competition is intensifying, the failure of the United States to lead in rule setting and to bind itself to countries that are important Chinese economic partners presages an avoidable loss of influence that could prove costly in times of crises or conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the U.S. abandonment of the TPP implies that Washington is willing to forego the enhanced trade gains that would derive from its participation in a high-quality agreement when even incremental increases in U.S. GDP only promise benefits for the competition with China. Because many TPP partners still possess relatively protected economies, U.S. participation in this agreement would pry open their hitherto closed markets and, by institutionalizing new and higher standards, limit China’s advantages in global trade.40 Consequently, the United States — to put it bluntly — should reenter the TPP at the earliest opportunity. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework now proposed by the Biden administration seems like thin gruel in contrast. To the degree that the administration seeks to vitalize its trade pillar by using the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement as a model, it will only end up recreating a simulacrum of the TPP. It should save itself the trouble and go for the real thing instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The larger issue of improving the relative gains enjoyed by the United States in the competition with China matters significantly for success in the U.S.-China competition because at the end of the day the nation with a larger and more efficient economy enjoys major advantages in any geopolitical face-off. That Beijing has been able to often exploit the international trading system unfairly over the last several decades has sometimes encouraged the idea that the United States would be better off without a trading partner like China. This erroneous notion, which surfaced during the Trump years, was encapsulated in the president’s belief that “Trade is Bad,” an idea that underlay his protectionist impulses and his inchoate ideas about decoupling from China. In the era prior to globalization, cutting off economic ties with China might have been a debatable solution for reducing Chinese relative gains and, by implication, the resources available to Beijing for power-political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interdependent international system, however, the idea is harebrained. It is in fact one of the paradoxes of security competition under interdependence that trade with one’s rivals is valuable precisely because it provides the additional resources necessary to sustain the competition with them, especially when foregoing trade with one’s competitors is meaningless when they have many other trading partners to choose from in a multi-actor environment. Any relative gains advantages that accrue to rivals in such circumstances should be mitigated by both better macroeconomic policies at home and creating supplementary — higher-standard — trading networks that exclude them. But desisting from trade with competitors, particularly when other partners cannot be denied to them, is rarely a good way to realize the relative gains necessary to secure advantages in the larger geopolitical contestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, undoubtedly, has to minimize its vulnerabilities to Chinese coercion, especially in an environment where China dominates global manufacturing. The solution to this problem consists of accepting the loss of some efficiency gains by promoting the purposeful diversification of supply. This requires assessing critical vulnerabilities in the supply chain, which matter most where national defense, information and communication technologies and platforms, and possibly public health are concerned — because constrained access here could have devastating consequences in times of conflict. Depending on the salience of other issue areas, alternative solutions such as stockpiling should be considered either as supplements or as substitutes to diversification. Because the United States must preserve its advantages in the arena of high technology, Washington should purposefully limit Beijing’s access to the critical tangible and intangible elements in this arena, but such defensive strategies must not degenerate into an indiscriminate attack on trade with China itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, therefore, is a deceptively simple one: U.S. power in the international system ultimately derives from America’s capacity to dominate the cycles of innovation globally. It is the ability to perpetually foment technological revolutions faster than any other state that nourishes U.S. global hegemony. Maintaining this dominance is intimately linked to the openness of American society, as embodied in its political, economic, and social institutions, as well as its openness to world, which is manifested in its hospitality to foreign goods, capital, ideas, and people. Any drift toward autarky that weakens these foundations undermines American power and, to that degree, impedes its capacity to prevail in the long-term rivalry with China more easily. Fortunately, most of the choices that bear on America’s capacity to out-innovate its rivals lie within its own control — and, hence, deserve as much attention as the threats posed by its competitors. In the long cycle of international politics, the United States will do better if it concentrates on staying ahead of its adversaries rather than obsessing about what might be required to pull them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;restoring-us-military-power&quot;&gt;RESTORING U.S. MILITARY POWER&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While building the appropriate international coalitions and strengthening American economic power, including through trade and innovation, are the foundations for success in the long-term competition with China, fielding effective military power is also indispensable. The success of the liberal international order, in fact, ultimately derives from the capacity of the United States to protect its members by force of arms when necessary. This requires Washington not merely to field capable military forces but rather superior ones relative to its adversaries because only functional dominance will allow the nation to win its wars at the lowest possible cost. The United States already deploys the world’s most formidable military capabilities, but they are unfortunately not necessarily appropriate for meeting the challenges posed by China today and in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the long cycle of international politics, the United States will do better if it concentrates on staying ahead of its adversaries rather than obsessing about what might be required to pull them down.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is largely because Washington was consumed during the last two decades with prosecuting multiple military operations against terrorist groups and insurgencies. This focus prevented the United States from making the investments necessary to deal with the new threats posed by great powers, even as it wore down the combat capabilities that were continuously involved in these misnamed “low-intensity” operations. Even when conflicts with distant state actors materialized, the United States enjoyed the advantage of being able to move forces into the theater without these arriving components being targeted en route to their deployment areas or in the rear, a luxury that is unlikely to be replicated in any future war with China. The U.S. military, therefore, for all its strengths, still requires significant recapitalization to equip it to deal with the threats posed by major state rivals, along with the appropriate changes in posture. Much has already been written on this subject before and, therefore, does not need repeating here. The following themes, however, are worth emphasizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core capability that the United States must recover is effective power projection. The capacity to deploy powerful military forces across the globe, sustain them at a distance from the homeland for extended periods of time, and permit them to win wars even against significant local opponents is what makes the United States a genuine superpower with no peers. Effective power projection thus requires potent combat elements — the sharpened spearpoint — as well as the larger command of the commons — to enable them to reach the relevant fronts and sustain their effectiveness when deployed forward. These capabilities matter a fortiori in Asia because rivalry with China entails the necessity of defending distant allies across the vast Pacific, allies that are located on China’s periphery and in close proximity to its vast military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing such a challenge is not altogether new for the United States. During the Cold War, Washington had to defend European allies that were closer in proximity to the Soviet Union than they were to the United States. Moreover, these partners were situated on a common landmass shared with Soviet power, which also had the advantage of being battle hardened and highly proficient at the operational level of war. In contrast, most U.S. allies in Asia (with the exception of South Korea and Thailand, which are thankfully unlikely to be threatened by Chinese land power) enjoy the benefits of “the stopping power of water.” And although they face a more multidimensionally capable China than the Soviet Union ever was, they are also advantaged by China’s lack of experience in prosecuting major combat operations involving the air and sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. strategy for coping with the threat posed by China to its allies conforms to the same pattern established during the Cold War: maintaining a combination of forward-deployed and forward-operating forces in proximity to China backed up by expeditionary components arriving from different parts of the world when necessary off the Asian Rimland. If war becomes inevitable, China’s “best” strategy for military success in the face of such a posture, then, arguably consists of quickly overwhelming its local adversaries before the United States can come to their assistance, while holding out the threat of interdicting all U.S. reinforcements that may be committed to their liberation if Washington chooses to resist the Chinese aggression. The corresponding “best” strategy for the United States, accordingly, is to deny China the ability to achieve these aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task of restoring U.S. military power must, however, be anchored first in a clear declaratory policy aimed at strengthening deterrence. Because preventing war is preferable even to winning it — even if winning in the first instance consists only of denying Beijing its immediate war aims — the United States must signal clearly to China that any attacks on its allies — to include Taiwan, if Washington is committed to defending it — will entail high costs that the United States is willing to bear despite the risks of escalation. Obviously, the costs of any nuclear escalation will be exorbitant, and the modernization of U.S. nuclear forces, which is already underway, will hopefully serve to prevent any Chinese use of nuclear weapons even in an intense crisis. The most pressing issue with respect to deterrence, however, is less likely to be nuclear but conventional: how far can the United States go with respect to the use of conventional military instruments in deterring China from using force against its allies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Because preventing war is preferable even to winning it, the United States must signal clearly to China that any attacks on its allies will entail high costs that the United States is willing to bear despite the risks of escalation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the most important restraint on the use of U.S. conventional capabilities would be targeting Chinese nuclear reserves, which should be avoided simply in order to minimize the risks of escalation. As China’s nuclear transformation proceeds, these risks actually diminish because it is unlikely that Beijing would ever find itself faced by “use or lose” pressures when it deploys a large, diversified, and survivable nuclear force. The hard question, consequently, pertains to conventional attacks on China’s conventional military assets on its homeland. In this context, Washington should consider the merits of signaling to Beijing that Chinese territory cannot be preserved as a sanctuary that is immune to U.S. conventional operations if China attacks American allies in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the degree possible, the U.S. military ought to invest in options to defend the allies that do not require any attacks on Chinese soil, but this may turn out to be either operationally difficult or politically untenable if China attacks allied homelands or U.S. bases in Asia. Consequently, there is good reason to shore up deterrence by communicating to China prior to any conflict that its costs would not only be prohibitive but could also entail attacks on Chinese territory — all with the aim of preventing Beijing’s recourse to force to begin with. Such threats are undoubtedly nettlesome, but their necessity — both to reassure allies and to defend them effectively — as well as the manner of their conveyance deserve careful attention now as the United States prepares for a long-term competition with China that embodies some non-trivial risk of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States clearly recognizes the need to acquire the relevant capabilities to win such a war both at the front and within the wider theater. The joint force has already developed sensible concepts of operations toward this end, and the importance of acquiring more long-range and stealthier platforms, unmanned delivery and support systems, advanced standoff munitions in large numbers, better air and missile defenses, a survivable command and control system employing diverse components, and a redundant and highly resilient basing infrastructure around the region is well appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the services are certain to incorporate these capabilities progressively into their force structure over time, they are faced with four distinct types of risk. To begin with, many of the technologies that are intended to provide the U.S. military with a critical edge are either still in development or are not yet mature (and, in some cases, are not even invented yet). Further, the current service plans to divest legacy systems in order to free up resources for their advanced and more expensive replacements are eminently sensible from a long-term perspective but run the danger of producing a weaker force in the interim, especially if the more pessimistic assessments about China’s aggressive timeline for absorbing Taiwan turn out to be true. More consequentially, even with corrections to the force structure gaps, the U.S. military still needs to complete the force posture adjustments and plans pertaining to positioning key military assets if they are to effectively contribute in a China contingency. Finally, any successful strategy for realizing effective U.S. power projection in Asia — which involves neutralizing China’s expansive investments in theater denial — entails some form of “archipelagic defense,” yet the political understandings with allies and partners that will be required to implement such a concept are far from being realized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the United States will be unable to restore its military power to serve the ends of successful extended deterrence in Asia and globally without sufficient budgetary support. Although the Biden administration, like the Obama administration before it, prioritizes the Indo-Pacific region specifically and the maintenance of U.S. military strength more generally, it has not yet provided the resources necessary for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative to achieve these aims. Either some increases in the current budgetary top line are necessary or a more radical restructuring of the service components is essential. The administration appears shy about pursuing the latter because it involves making hard choices about which service’s budget must be robbed to pay for the expansion of the others; and it seems equally shy about pursuing the former course because of the constraints of domestic politics, even while its own budgetary requests are still populated by “a series of programs. . . that are of questionable utility to the Department of Defense’s [core] mission.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any calls for increased budgets invariably provoke criticism by skeptics who charge that the U.S. allocation for defense is already larger than the next nine countries combined — a complaint that, although trivially correct, fails to meter America’s defense expenditures against the extent of its interests, not to mention its hegemonic responsibilities. The plain fact of the matter is that the United States today spends about 3 percent of its GDP on defense, a far cry from the 6 percent or more spent during the Reagan administration and the even higher levels committed earlier in the Cold War. Washington can afford to spend more on defense if it chooses to without undermining the larger economy, and it will certainly blow through the current top line if it is forced to by a war with China. If a more modest increment now and in the future serves to strengthen deterrence and avoid conflict, the American people would certainly be better served by such a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little doubt that China represents the most serious challenge to U.S. hegemony since the fall of the Soviet Union. In the face of this challenge, it is often feared that the U.S. investment in opposing the Russian invasion of Ukraine might prove to be an enervating distraction that prevents Washington from effectively facing up to Beijing’s ambitions. These are not imaginary anxieties, but what is even more worrisome is that the American polity will fail to perceive that Chinese and Russian assertiveness goes beyond the specific threats they pose in the Indo-Pacific and Europe, respectively. Rather, they represent challenges to the larger liberal international order underwritten by U.S. hegemonic power — and the United States may end up mounting only a ragged defense if its people either are divided among themselves, fail to receive the benefits of hegemonic stability, or suffer a loss of civic virtue. These are indeed the greater and more enduring challenges faced by the United States, which must be addressed if the American regime is to be revitalized both abroad and at home. Doing so effectively is not beyond the nation’s capacities. A successful response here will strengthen the United States in the coming decades and protect both its values and its interests. It will also permit the productive — and necessary — engagement of China, but as Zalmay Khalilzad has perceptively argued, “engagement must be done from a position of strength with a clear-minded appreciation of the daunting realities we face.”&lt;/p&gt;

The senior leadership directs resource distribution globally, helping to surge support to take advantage of opportunities as they arise in different theaters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salafi-jihadi groups’ growing focus on local insurgent dynamics has enabled them to build support, expand territorially, and develop new capabilities. Weak governance and unaddressed grievances have made them resilient to counterterrorism operations, including leadership attrition, and enabled their reemergence after setbacks. Globally, Salafi-jihadi groups are set to strengthen as counterterrorism pressure lessens and local conditions worsen. They have prioritized local expansion over targeting the West, their “far enemy,” because of their operational successes in regional theaters. They may be able to generate or reconstitute transnational terror attack capabilities, which US counterterrorism pressure has largely eliminated, from these local bases. Al Shabaab, for example, pursued another 9/11-style attack in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan continues to reverberate through the Salafi-jihadi movement. Al Shabaab and others have cited the Taliban’s strategy as a model for their own success through jihad. Moreover, the new terrorist sanctuary in Afghanistan permitted al Qaeda to revitalize its lagging global media presence and possibly better coordinate among its affiliates. The global reduction in counterterrorism resources has also lifted pressure from many Salafi-jihadi groups, which increasingly enjoy their own regional safe havens from where they threaten to destabilize nearby states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;africa&quot;&gt;Africa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salafi-jihadi groups have expanded rapidly in Africa. They have sustained local attack cells and broader insurgencies by capitalizing on local instability and governments’ inability to provide security and services, including drought and famine response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In East Africa&lt;/strong&gt;, al Shabaab’s insurgency in Somalia endures. Al Shabaab controls significant parts of south-central Somalia and has escalated attacks in the capital region since early 2022. It capitalized on diminished counterterrorism pressure caused by the withdrawal of US troops in 2021. Pressure on al Shabaab has increased since the reinsertion of US forces in May 2022, but its gains will take time to reverse. Additionally, al Shabaab conducted two military incursions into Ethiopia in summer 2022, indicating an intent to expand regionally. The Somali Islamic State province is relatively small but serves as an intermediary and financial hub for multiple Islamic State branches. It links the Islamic State’s central and east African provinces to Islamic State leadership in Iraq and Syria and transmits funds to Afghanistan via Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2022, Islamic State leadership declared the Islamic State Central Africa Province (ISCAP) and the Islamic State in Mozambique (ISM) autonomous, rather than two wings of the same province. Both ISM and ISCAP may benefit from their connection to IS leadership, which may push them to focus on a broader regional approach or increase their emphasis on external operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2020, ISM has been engaged in an insurgency in northern Mozambique. Mozambican, Rwandan, and Southern African Development Community forces dislodged ISM from key towns in 2021, but ISM has relocated, expanded its activities elsewhere in the region — including increasing cross-border attacks into Tanzania — and encouraged fighters to melt into civilian communities until called on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, ISCAP has pursued a low-level insurgency for several years, prompting the declaration of martial law in two provinces in 2021. Ugandan and Congolese forces engaged in a concerted counterterrorism effort in late 2021 and early 2022, prompted by ISCAP attacks in Uganda, but ISCAP’s frequency of attacks has held steady. Over the past two years, ISCAP has effectively doubled its area of operation, increased its operational tempo, and attracted more foreign fighters. It has also freed upward of 2,000 prisoners in major prison breaks since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In North Africa&lt;/strong&gt;, the Islamic State Sinai Province (ISSP) continues to conduct attacks against gas pipelines and the Egyptian armed forces but has declined in strength due to persistent Egyptian counterterrorism pressure and the resolution of underlying local grievances. The leader of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) remains in Algeria, but its focus has been the success of its subordinate affiliates in the Sahel, primarily Jama’at Nusrat al Islam wa al Muslimeen (JNIM). AQIM appears to operate as a link to al Qaeda’s global leadership and a financial and ideological facilitator, although it has not exhibited significant independent operational capacity in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In West Africa&lt;/strong&gt;, JNIM has embedded itself in communities in central Mali, providing aspects of governance, including administering justice, brokering interethnic peace deals, and imposing taxes. From this stronghold, it launched a series of attacks in southern Mali in summer 2022 and actively threatens security in Bamako, Mali’s capital. The withdrawal of French forces from Mali and possible further easing of counterterrorism pressure will permit JNIM to further entrench itself in central and northern Mali. JNIM previously expanded into Burkina Faso and has attack cells in Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, and Togo. JNIM’s population-centric approach better positions it to gain local support compared to its local Salafi-jihadi rival, the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), known for its brutality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, the Islamic State declared ISGS an autonomous province, recognizing it as the Islamic State Sahel Province. The group has struggled due to leadership attrition. Malian pressure and intergroup competition have forced ISGS to reevaluate current approaches, including agreeing to a truce with JNIM. But ISGS remains an active operator in Mali’s embattled eastern provinces and a major threat to civilians in western Niger and northern Burkina Faso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In northeastern Nigeria, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) has absorbed or eclipsed much of Boko Haram, the group from which it originally splintered. Over the past year, ISWAP has increased in operational tempo and audacity, including a large-scale prison break in July 2022 on the outskirts of Abuja, Nigeria’s capital. Its insurgency in the northeast is ongoing, but a rise in operations in central Nigeria indicates it has begun to build networks and capacity outside of its current strongholds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In northwestern Nigeria, al Qaeda–linked Ansaru appears to be making a resurgence after several years of dormancy. The group confirmed its loyalty to AQIM. Although it is not yet a major threat, its ascendency indicates growing al Qaeda influence in the region. It appears to be pursuing a population-centric strategy and has adopted the banditry tactics common to other militant groups in northern Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;middle-east&quot;&gt;Middle East&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterterrorism campaigns have weakened Salafi-jihadi groups in Iraq and Yemen, though early indicators point to the groups reconstituting capabilities. Broader regional instability has set favorable conditions for Salafi-jihadi groups, particularly in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Iraq and Syria&lt;/strong&gt;, the Islamic State in Iraq and al Sham (ISIS) has exhibited resilience and persistence in the face of extensive counterterrorism operations. In Iraq, ISIS activities have declined in 2021 and 2022, but this may reflect a reorientation toward Syria to take advantage of growing instability and insecurity. ISIS has conducted several complex attacks, including a major January 2022 prison break in Hasakah, northern Syria, from its strongholds and training camps in the Syrian desert. Massive camps of displaced persons, many related to imprisoned ISIS fighters, may further stress security in Syria. The loss of multiple senior Islamic State leaders, both killed and captured, has weakened the global Islamic State leadership cadre operating from Iraq and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hayat Tahrir al Sham controls significant territory in northwestern Syria and has made a concerted effort to portray itself as moderate and legitimate, distancing itself from its Salafi-jihadi roots. It has consolidated power by targeting Hurras al Din — also known as al Qaeda in Syria — and occasionally the Islamic State in Idlib province, where Hayat Tahrir al Sham is the de facto governing body. It has pledged to provide services and defend those under its jurisdiction, and it exerts market controls and extracts taxes. Hurras al Din still professes strong loyalty to al Qaeda. It has been weakened over the past few years, though it remains active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Yemen&lt;/strong&gt;, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) continued to strengthen slowly under reduced counterterrorism pressure. The group is more fragmented, but it remains focused on regenerating transnational attack capabilities, fighting the Houthis and local opposition and inspiring lone-wolf attacks in the US and Europe. The Islamic State in Yemen remains on a downward trajectory. Its key value to the global Islamic State network is its role as a financial and facilitation link between IS-Somalia and Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;south-asia&quot;&gt;South Asia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salafi-jihadi groups in the region have strengthened considerably since the August 2021 withdrawal of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan. Al Qaeda and al Qaeda–linked groups enjoy increased freedoms under the Taliban, while ISKP has strengthened. In Indonesia and the Philippines, counterterrorism efforts have been successful at degrading Islamic State cells. Major attacks have decreased substantially, though some pockets of militancy remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Afghanistan and Pakistan&lt;/strong&gt;, the Taliban has reestablished a safe haven for al Qaeda and al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) since the withdrawal of US and NATO forces in August 2021. Al Qaeda has not yet seen an increase in external operating capacity, but the apparent freedom with which al Qaeda leadership operates in Afghanistan indicates that recruitment, training, and propaganda operations are likely to increase. Some counterterrorism successes, such as the targeting of the late al Qaeda emir Ayman al Zawahiri, may be disruptive in the short term, but counterterrorism pressure has diminished substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AQIS has maintained a low profile and individual fighters remain part of Taliban combat units. The Haqqani network retains its role as a regional facilitator and link between various regional Salafi-jihadi groups, with close ties to the Taliban and al Qaeda. Notably, the Haqqani network’s leader is a cabinet member in the new Taliban government and has been implicated in harboring Zawahiri. The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, while engaged in ongoing negotiations with the Pakistani government, has benefited substantially from Taliban leadership in Afghanistan. Splinter groups have rejoined the primary organization, and in March 2022, it announced a spring offensive against Pakistani security forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISKP reconstituted over the course of 2021, taking advantage of Afghanistan’s instability in the wake of the Taliban takeover. The Taliban’s counterinsurgency operations against ISKP have had mixed results as ISKP focuses on undermining Taliban control, attacking infrastructure and targeting sectarian and ethnic divisions in Afghanistan and reestablishing former strongholds. ISKP’s ranks have swelled due to fighters’ release from prison during the Taliban’s summer 2021 offensive and increased recruitment afterward. The Islamic State has increased its funding for ISKP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Southeast Asia&lt;/strong&gt;, authorities have made a significant impact on the operational capacity of Islamic State–linked groups, although they still pose a threat. In the southern Philippines, some pockets of activity remain, and periodic clashes with government forces and small-scale attacks continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leadership&quot;&gt;Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decapitation approach has strained al Qaeda’s and the Islamic State’s leadership cadres, though both have proven resilient to attrition. The Islamic State has routinized its leadership succession, but turnover in the group’s senior leadership has helped weaken its ties to its regional branches, resulting in forced delegation of authority to local leaders. Al Qaeda’s already decentralized structure limits the impact of leadership deaths, but attrition in the ranks of its next generation of leaders may challenge the organization in the future. Newfound sanctuary in Afghanistan and the release of al Qaeda operatives from prison has enabled increased messaging from senior leaders to their global followers and added to the number of veteran operatives on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Salafi-jihadi leaders as of September 2022 include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saif al Adel&lt;/em&gt;: A senior al Qaeda operative assessed to be the most likely new emir following the August 2022 death of Zawahiri. Adel spent significant time in Iran and may now be in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abdul Rahman al Maghrebi&lt;/em&gt;: An al Qaeda shura council member, al Sahab media director, and head of external communications. He is believed to be in Iran. An alternate potential successor to Zawahiri.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abu Ubaydah Yusef al Annabi&lt;/em&gt;: AQIM’s emir, a longtime senior member. He succeeded Abdelmalek Droukdel after his death in June 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Khalid Batarfi&lt;/em&gt;: AQAP’s emir since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ahmed Umar (Abu Ubaidah)&lt;/em&gt;: Al Shabaab’s emir since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iyad ag Ghaly&lt;/em&gt;: JNIM emir with long-standing ties to AQIM.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samir Hijazi&lt;/em&gt;: Hurras al Din’s leader.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Osama Mahmood&lt;/em&gt;: AQIS’s emir since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islamic State&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abu al Hasan al Hashimi al Qurayshi&lt;/em&gt;: Islamic State leader and successor to Abu Ibrahim al Qurayshi, who was killed in February 2022. Possibly the nom de guerre of either Juma’a Awad Ibrahim al Badri or Bashar Khattab al Sumaidai, both high-ranking Islamic State leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tamim al Kurdi&lt;/em&gt;: Leader of the Afghanistan-based al Siddiq office, appointed by Islamic State senior leadership in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abdul Bara al Sahrawi&lt;/em&gt;: ISGS’s emir, a seasoned logistical officer with experience operating in Libya. He replaced Adnan Abu Walid al Sahrawi after his death in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abu Musab al Barnawi&lt;/em&gt;: Served as ISWAP’s emir between August 2016 and March 2019, before being appointed head of the Islamic State’s al Furqan office, which is based in the Lake Chad region and coordinates regional branches, in May 2021. His current status is unclear. The Nigerian government reported in September 2021 he had been killed, but unsubstantiated reports have since emerged that he remains alive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Musa Baluku&lt;/em&gt;: ISCAP’s leader in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abu Yasir Hassan&lt;/em&gt;: ISCAP’s leader in Mozambique, as identified by the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shahab al Muhajir&lt;/em&gt;: ISKP’s emir, an Iraqi who defected from the Haqqani network and al Qaeda and succeeded the group’s founder, Hafiz Saeed Khan, in April 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abu Hajar al Hashemi&lt;/em&gt;: ISSP’s emir. He may have served previously as an Iraqi army officer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abdul Qadir Mumin&lt;/em&gt;: IS-Somalia’s emir. He defected from al Shabaab.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abu Zacharia&lt;/em&gt;: Leader of ISEA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;salafi-jihadi-attacks-with-american-casualties-202122&quot;&gt;Salafi-Jihadi attacks with American Casualties (2021–22)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salafi-jihadi groups such as al Shabaab, AQAP, and ISIS have pursued external attack capabilities but have not conducted a terror attack in the US since the December 2019 shooting in Pensacola, Florida. The most recent attack against US forces was the ISKP suicide attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, in August 2021. US forces on counterterrorism missions are no longer engaged in combat operations, limiting the opportunities for Salafi-jihadi groups to target them. Salafi-jihadi groups have targeted Westerners in kidnapping-for-ransom plots. In late August 2022, US special operations forces rescued an American kidnapped in Burkina Faso in April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Katherine Zimmerman</name></author><summary type="html">Salafi-jihadi groups are increasingly embedded in local conflicts, even while remaining part of al Qaeda’s and the Islamic State’s global networks.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/H60615l.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/H60615l.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Software-Defined Warfare</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-09-07-software-defined-warfare.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Software-Defined Warfare" /><published>2022-09-07T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-09-07T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/software-defined-warfare</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2022-09-07-software-defined-warfare.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the future, warfighting will only become more complex, even more chaotic, and even faster. The only way to stay competitive in a new warfighting environment is to ensure that it uses the most potent weapon available: technology, and more specifically, software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 20, 2011, Marc Andreessen published “Why Software Is Eating the World.” In the decade since this seminal article was written — an eternity in the technology industry — an entire new generation of “digital native” companies has emerged that forced slower-moving incumbents out of business. Technology has been devouring the world, and it also eats its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military is considered the best in the world. With a budget larger than the next 10 militaries combined, the Department of Defense (DOD) outspends, out-equips, and out-trains its competitors. It is also an industrial-age, hardware-centric organization that has the “biggest, the mostest, and the bestest” military capital investments: tanks, ships, aircraft, and everything in between. Unfortunately, in today’s world, hardware is “old-school” — low-margin, commodity products that are manufactured, stored, shipped, and consumed. After depreciation and excessive wear and tear, hardware is scrapped for parts or ends up in a boneyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military’s hardware systems are built to wrap multiple layers of metal and protection around fragile human beings who operate these machines under fire and extreme levels of stress, with the planning and orders coming from groups of people watching screens and integrating information through PowerPoint and Excel. The DOD accomplishes incredible things, but as remarkable as the Department is in many ways, it shares with almost all other federal agencies the common trait of lagging woefully behind the commercial software industry’s state of the art — in everything from automating back-office functions to providing digital warfighting services to its customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances, an organization like the DOD would be a huge target for “disruption” by entrepreneurs and investors (a euphemism for “putting out of business”). Fortunately, it has a monopoly on the nation’s warfighting functions, which insulates it from the usual forms of market competition. Yet this very monopoly is also the root cause of many of the worst problems when it comes to the DOD’s failure to adopt new technologies, change its legacy workflows and processes, and design and experiment with new operating concepts. Within the U.S. government, the DOD does not experience the kind of brutal, capitalist, Darwinian journey by which incumbent organizations face off against hungry new start-ups and risk getting pushed to the side — where the start-up takes over as the “new DOD” with brand-new underlying tech. Equally problematic, the massive DOD bureaucracy struggles with the kind of periodic “tech refresh” that has been instrumental to commercial industry success. While it is insulated from market competition within the U.S. economy, the DOD is not immune from the kind of revolutionary, secular, and wide-ranging technological changes happening outside the government. Nor is it immune from the threat of competition with other militaries around the world. Either the DOD will change itself, or its competitors will force it to change — after it might be too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States to retain its dominant position in the future — which is not a guaranteed outcome — the DOD needs a new design and architecture that will allow it to be far more flexible, scale on demand, and adapt dynamically to changing conditions. And it must do so at a dramatically lower cost as it delivers its critical services. Central to this will be changing the role of the human in the information and decision loop as well as at the endpoint: increasing speed, accuracy, scale, and techniques to confuse, disorient, and overwhelm the adversary while preventing them from doing the same to U.S. forces. The DOD’s systems will need to support dramatically faster decisionmaking and execution speeds; allow for rapidly updating and modifying systems; lower the cost structure of building and deploying these systems; and upend the marginal cost and speed of delivering new functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that the DOD must dramatically change the way it builds warfighting systems is hardly novel. There have been hundreds of articles, think-tank papers, and books that have made a compelling case for radical change. One of the best recent examples is The Kill Chain by Chris Brose, who calls upon the DOD to build a “military Internet of Things” that involves “large networks of autonomous systems” and a different mix of weapons systems. Likewise, in crafting the concept of the Third Offset Strategy, former deputy secretary of defense Bob Work has argued for years about the need for major DOD-wide changes, especially the widespread adoption of autonomous systems and AI-enabled capabilities. Other ideas that percolate regularly in defense policy circles revolve around concepts such as networked warfare, mosaic warfare, and next-generation battle networks. Much of this work describes the problem but does not get to the level of proposing concrete technology solutions. In solving extremely hard technology problems, leading commercial technology companies typically start by outlining a set of key architectural standards upon which the entire system will be built. This paper outlines the architecture needed for next-generation warfighting systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to this architecture lies in software. Software is disrupting and reconstituting entire industries — especially those that rely on manual processes and fail to leverage the power of low or zero marginal costs. This is not about sprinkling “magic software dust” on a company or business model to make it work. Software needs to be at the core of every business and operating model before any business can hope to gain an enduring competitive advantage. The DOD is no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;closing-the-kill-chain-getting-inside-a-competitors-ooda-loop&quot;&gt;Closing the Kill Chain, Getting inside a Competitor’s OODA Loop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “kill chain,” a phrase that long predates Brose’s book, refers to a multistep process that involves absorbing information, turning that information into knowledge (actionable intelligence), making a decision, acting on the decision, understanding the consequences of that decision, and refining future actions accordingly. Similarly, John Boyd’s “OODA loop” concept refers to the process by which an individual, commander, or team progresses through the same stages: observe, orient, decide, and act. The final part of the process — acting or closing the kill chain — is generally associated with firing and destroying something, but in today’s world it could also include a non-kinetic effect such as delivering a cyberattack against a target or deploying a piece of misinformation designed to disrupt the adversary’s orientation phase of the OODA loop while protecting one’s own. In general, the side that can consistently demonstrate shorter, tighter, and more resilient OODA loops will gain an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the kill chain and OODA loop are essentially workflows buttressed by human cognition. Today, these workflows are implemented as a confusing mess of manual, semi-manual (including telephone calls), and electronic processes. It is both exciting and shocking to visit a combatant command operations center. In peacetime, it is easy to see how these commands and their subordinate units can handle a relatively limited number of aircraft and ships moving around. What is hard to imagine is how extant manual processes will be capable of tracking hundreds, if not thousands, of moving objects in wartime, all tasked with delivering kinetic and non-kinetic effects from undersea through space, cyberspace, and everything else in between. Executing these workflows so every step of the process and the data flows are done in software, even though decisionmaking is still in the hands of human commanders and operators, can yield a decisive advantage over an adversary: every stage of the OODA loop is tighter, faster, and more well-informed. Conversely, not taking a digital-age, software-centric approach in the battlespaces of the future could very well mean tactical, operational, and even strategic defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers can easily misconstrue such “software cheerleading” as implying the demise of hardware. That misses the point. Military hardware and weapons systems are still vitally important. However, they need to be tethered to the end of internet-scale software systems that handle all the complexity of decisionmaking, targeting, and resourcing — everything but the final step of executing a decision to close the kill chain. Software will fundamentally and irretrievably change the value of hardware by making the processes that lead to the desired effects faster, cheaper, more efficient, scalable, and more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-from-data-center-architecture&quot;&gt;Lessons from Data Center Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transferring lessons and experience from other domains can help inform breakthrough solutions to big problems in the DOD and other federal government organizations. Years of building large-scale software systems have revealed best principles and practices on how to design computer software and systems for squeezing out the maximum performance at the lowest cost and, where appropriate, removing the most expensive, least scalable, and slowest parts of the process and cost structure: humans, followed by hardware. These same concepts can — and should — be applied to the DOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the computer industry, “software defined” is a broad architectural concept that drives a few different core design decisions. These design decisions turn a bunch of disconnected hardware products into an integrated whole that can be operated and managed as a single platform. It also takes control and complexity, which is typically distributed all over the place, and centralizes it where it can be simplified, managed, and scaled. In military terms, this is centralized direction and decentralized execution: the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the large-scale computing systems and platforms used in the technology industry are software defined. The largest cloud-computing platforms, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, are all “software-defined computing platforms” relying on “software-defined networking” (SDN); their storage is now “software defined,” as are fifth-generation wireless (5G) telecom systems, with provisioning and routing all done via software. These large-scale platforms run on commodity hardware (in some cases, built in house) with large-scale orchestration software that pulls the complexity out of the lower levels of the platform to a central system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to ask whether today’s computer systems can handle the scale and size of a battlefield. The answer is a resounding “yes!” Internet-scale companies such as Apple, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Netflix, and others routinely connect billions of users and systems every day, exchanging content and video in real time. While these companies do not typically face the risk of actual kinetic effects destroying their data centers, they do deal with cybercriminals and nation-state–sponsored cyberattacks — and even squirrels or rats eating through cable wires. The best of these architectures are built to be resilient in the event of failure. If these companies can operate at this enormous scale, there is no reason whatsoever why the same key concepts cannot be applied to warfighting to weave together thousands of hardware objects into a single software-defined system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-architect-for-scaling&quot;&gt;Concept: Architect for Scaling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier computer systems and software were designed to allow a single application to run on a single computer system. When a computer system ran out of capacity, the solution was always to throw more resources at the problem: a faster processor, more disk space, a faster network card, and so on. This method is called “vertical scaling.” Once a server was running at capacity, you were done, as there are physical limits to the resources you can add to a system. Over time, this evolution led the industry to one of the biggest systems possible: the mainframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of this paper’s authors had his first job out of college at a hot, upstart company called Sun Microsystems that was revolutionizing network computing. Sun computers — called “pizza boxes” because they looked like one — were competing against the mighty mainframe. Instead of the “unit of scaling” for the mainframe, which was another mainframe, to scale up you simply added a single “pizza box” worth of additional computing and memory every time you needed some marginal resources for an application. This marginal-expense option is far more attractive than being forced to buy another giant, multi-million-dollar mainframe that might only be 10 percent utilized. This method of small, marginal additions is called “horizontal scaling” and was created to overcome the limits of vertical scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a single, large computer system running an application, horizontal scaling involves distributing an application’s computing workloads across multiple, smaller computer systems. Unfortunately, moving from a vertically to horizontally scaled architecture does not come free. The software itself needs to be re-architected to support this new underlying system topology. Issues such as database storage (which is hard to distribute across multiple systems), file systems, caches and data consistency, software queues, and load balancers come into play. As companies moved their legacy applications from their on-premises data centers to the cloud, they realized they had to re-factor or even rewrite their applications to take full advantage of what cloud computing could provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer systems in older data centers are called “pets” because each computer system would have a unique name, typically part of a broader naming scheme. Popular naming schemes were the planets in the solar system or cats (e.g., “Fluffy”). Just as if a pet got sick and had to be taken to the vet, if one of these computers had a problem, engineers would try their best to fix it. In contrast, today’s computers running at a major cloud vendor have a virtually meaningless string of characters as a name (e.g., “i-0123456789abcdef”) — unfortunately, just like anonymous cattle. Cloud-computing instances are created and destroyed all the time, with little sentimental value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying this to the United States’ warfighting systems architecture is simple: The DOD needs a massive number of cheap, disposable, and easy-to-manufacture endpoint systems that it can concentrate, distribute, and scale up or down as the need arises. In many cases, these systems will require little or no maintenance. If one breaks, you just replace it with an identical clone, driving down overall complexity in logistics and maintenance. Parts of the DOD are already thinking about this concept (with smaller drones, for example), but the Department needs to start applying this architectural thinking to many more of the aspects of hardware, vehicles, and weapons systems that it builds or buys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-eliminate-single-points-of-failure&quot;&gt;Concept: Eliminate Single Points of Failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current design points for the U.S. military are hardware centric, human centric, and big. Size matters. The mighty aircraft carrier exemplifies this paradigm. It costs billions of dollars to build, carries thousands of sailors, and hosts dozens of different kinds of fighter aircraft. It sits in the middle of a carrier strike group (CSG), with many ships and submarines tasked to protect it. The protection offered by the CSG makes it extremely hard to sink a U.S. aircraft carrier. However, taking out an aircraft carrier destroys the entire CSG architecture, making it nearly useless for the purpose for which it was designed: to project force around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aircraft carrier, given its size and footprint, is like a very large mainframe or a large database system. An aircraft carrier is vertically scaled, as the unit of scaling for the system is yet another aircraft carrier. Many of these vertically scaled systems are also single points of failure. Since these systems are very expensive, there are normally not any redundancies from running two systems at the same time. The crash of a mainframe or database system crashes the entire system, as there is no backup. Obviously, architectures that have such single points of failure are extremely brittle and eventually fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying and eliminating these single points of failure are critical to building a resilient architecture, both in commercial industry and in the DOD. The aircraft carrier and the concept of the CSG were created at a time before China developed carrier-killer missiles. At $10 million a missile, shooting a few of these and hitting a U.S. carrier worth upward of $10 billion would generate an eye-watering return on investment (ROI). Or, as some of the fighting in Ukraine seems to presage, you can get an even more impressive ROI by attacking a CSG with hundreds (if not thousands) of small, attritable, armed, autonomous swarming drones, all of which can be horizontally scaled on demand to attack the most vulnerable parts of the enemy’s position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-virtualization&quot;&gt;Concept: Virtualization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtualization technology has revolutionized data centers by transforming a computer server into a virtual machine that can be copied, cloned, snapshotted, and moved around. It has helped create the revolution in cloud computing and “software as a service” by allowing users to rent computers by the minute and operate them remotely at an incredibly competitive cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its generic form, virtualization is the act of creating an abstraction and translation layer between two distinct systems, such as hardware and software, or taking an older system and allowing it to be manipulated and managed as part of larger digital workflows. Initially, virtualization’s most popular trait was the ability to take older/legacy Windows operating systems (such as Windows 2000) and continue to run them on newer hardware, as well as the ability to consolidate the systems into a central data center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of legacy military platforms, sensors, and workflows, virtualizing the system involves wrapping it in a set of callable Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow it to participate in any electronic workflows without the interruption of a manual process. An API is a standardized software layer with a set of well-defined and well-documented software entry points that a programmer can call from their code to receive data and initiate processes. Once kill chains have been converted to end-to-end electronic workflows, the effect of a weapons system at the end of such a workflow can be implemented as an API call. Ideally, these APIs should be two-way: inbound ones that allow for the control and execution of the system and outbound ones that provide status, capacity, usage statistics, and the like that can be fed back into the orchestration system for planning, resupply, and resource management. Even if a system can only enable some APIs — for instance, outbound APIs that deliver status and supply-level information — that is still a substantial improvement, as its calculations can be networked into the broader orchestration systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During previous DOD Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) demonstrations, the military services demonstrated API-based access to weapons systems. This is a crucial first step. In effect, it means that those systems could be integrated as part of electronic kill chains and brought under the management of the overall software orchestration engine. This functionality, however, needs to be moved into production and to the field instead of just used once in demonstrations or experiments. The importance of changing the DOD’s mindset from relying on individual hardware systems and one-off software programs to using a system centered on the role of APIs cannot be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second dimension of virtualization is to set up the endpoint hardware to run multiple software stacks simultaneously, all completely isolated from each other logically but sharing the underlying hardware platform. There are numerous cases where fixed, one-time hardware costs dominate. The ability to dynamically reprogram or switch to a completely different workload stack — for example, based on the time of day — can drive up the utilization of the hardware. Small examples are cell phones, with a user potentially wanting to use multiple phone numbers (tied to SIM cards) on a single device. A more complex and expensive example is a satellite, for which the initial costs of building and launching the system are often extremely high, while the variable costs of operating it are fairly predictable. Squeezing out maximum utility from such an expensive system can make the difference between a profitable investment and one that is losing money. In addition, thinking about a constellation of satellites as a “computing grid” able to deploy multiple/dynamic workloads can fundamentally transform the traditional paradigm of satellites as having a fixed function. Instead, they can be used in the same way as any flexible cloud-computing system, giving actual “computing in the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-low-cost-commodity-hardware-and-stateless-endpoints&quot;&gt;Concept: Low-Cost Commodity Hardware and Stateless Endpoints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original Top Gun movie, it is hard to miss “MAVERICK” stenciled on Pete Mitchell’s plane — which is very cool until you start wondering what happens if it breaks down. One can just imagine this line from Ed Harris (playing the admiral in the latest film): “Maverick, I’ve got some bad news. Your airplane is going to be down for maintenance. The good news is that you can take Iceman’s jet if he agrees to give it up!” That might be great for Maverick, but he would have to face off against Iceman, who would rather die than give up the chance to fly his own jet. On top of that, Iceman won’t appreciate Maverick messing with his seat settings, air freshener, and radio presets!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea that Maverick can only fly the plane with his name on it gets us back to the concept of “pets vs. cattle” systems — that a single piece of hardware has to be bound to a single pilot, and we cannot dynamically switch the pilot over to another piece of hardware through a “just-in-time” software deployment. Core to the architectural shift from vertical to horizontal scaling is making the actual endpoint systems both stateless and disposable, which introduces the possibility of just-in-time software deployment and configuration. The advantages of this approach include the ability to move to dramatically lower-cost hardware over time (i.e., ride the commoditization curve); scale up and down as needed; rapidly provision new systems; bypass bottlenecks in emergencies (if something breaks, just provision to a new system and fix things later); and introduce new security advantages, since the endpoint systems always have the latest software and do not retain state. Data, which should be clearly compartmentalized away from system and application software, lives in the cloud and synchronizes to the endpoint as needed for local processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these obvious benefits, the DOD should start thinking about how to integrate newer technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) into existing systems and how to design new systems differently from the ground up. Currently, the DOD thinks of deploying a “global” hardware platform — for example, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) — across multiple areas of responsibility (AORs). In a pre-AI age, this did not present any major problems. As the DOD integrates more AI-based software in these systems, however, the data the algorithms are trained on for each AOR can vary widely. For example, the data from Eastern Europe, which has snowy or muddy fields, and the South China Sea, which has open water and scattered islands, can be very different. AI software performs optimally when it is retrained from new data collected in an operational setting. In the digital age, fielded AI models must be updated regularly. Beyond Project Maven and the DOD Joint AI Center, there are few operational examples in the DOD of AI software fielded via continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) even though the approach was routinized in commercial industry a long time ago. The idea that fielded AI software is never finished and requires continuous updates is not a niche idea. At some point, almost every piece of software will be AI-enabled and, if embedded into hardware systems, will need to be designed for continuous and even over-the-air remote updates. As the DOD operationalizes this at scale, it will have to become much smarter about deploying just-in-time software on local systems custom-tailored to the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, once a crisis or conflict begins, bugs and problems in fielded systems will require fast fixes. This is no different than how commercial products move rapidly from “minimum viable product” to demonstrated high-performance production products. The ability to turn around a patch or “dot release” of software and deploy them to fielded hardware systems will become a key differentiator in future conflicts. Just as Apple runs operating systems such as macOS®, iOS® (for iPhones), and iPadOS®, the DOD should envision a day where it has a TankOS®, FighterOS®, and ShipOS® — each running individual hardware systems. Each armed service should be able to deliver over-the-air patches and new apps to each OS for improving functionality and fixing bugs. There is no question that in the first phase of any war, the United States’ adversaries will be launching a number of “zero-day” cyberattacks against its weapons systems vulnerabilities. The country’s ability to get back into the fight will be dependent on the DOD’s ability to spin patches for these vulnerabilities, clean up its endpoints, and do rapid updates of its systems before booting them up again. If the DOD adopted a stateless, just-in-time software deployment model, the time needed to close this loop will be dramatically shorter than having to clean up malware off of a stateful software/hardware system and ensure that it is malware free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-design-for-instrumentation&quot;&gt;Concept: Design for Instrumentation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since anyone can track the delivery of a hamburger or pizza on their phone in real time, it is unfathomable that the DOD’s combatant commanders cannot gain real-time visibility into the endpoint systems that are under their management. Today, almost every product used is heavily instrumented to measure a variety of data: real-time control of the endpoint system, status of the endpoint, and (on the development side) understanding what features end users are utilizing. There are hundreds of great products to choose from to both instrument and track this usage, and the DOD’s endpoint hardware systems need to be designed and built with instrumentation integrated into them from the outset. (A critique of user interfaces/user experiences in the DOD is outside the scope of this paper. Unfortunately, UI/UX best practices remain a foreign concept to most DOD hardware and software system developers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important design element is to include sensors for every part of the system that could be relevant for remote control and orchestration, as well as any other components that are crucial to the operation of the overall system. The sensors should provide the ability to read such information as on/off status, unit values, and the like. The simplest and most telling example is that many of the resources and munitions on all airplanes and tanks are still not tracked automatically — with few exceptions and rarely in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a particular component includes one or more sensors, the next question is whether those sensors should be paired with the ability to automate the component. Obviously, any component with a read-only sensor cannot be automated, but it should be possible to automate the others. This includes test and evaluation (T&amp;amp;E) sensors capable of reporting to users when a fielded system is not performing as expected. This is especially important for systems that integrate so-called “black-box” AI capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The close friend of instrumentation is real-time connectivity and reporting. If real-time connectivity is not possible, then the next best option is an ability to synchronize prioritized data when the system regains a connection. Currently, the DOD’s version of an iPhone sync is pulling out a hard drive from a helicopter, plane, or drone, then shipping it cross-country to a secure data center where it can be downloaded and processed. The military cannot continue to operate this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-simulation-testing-verification&quot;&gt;Concept: Simulation, Testing, Verification&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning, exercises, and wargaming have always been an integral part of warfighting preparation. Scenes of military leaders and policymakers standing around tables with large maps that include board pieces representing personnel, tanks, aircraft, and ships — from the United States and its allies and partners, as well as the adversary — are sufficiently familiar. Each side makes a move, the outcomes of which are then assessed by impartial observers before the next round of moves. Military wargames like this take place regularly but not nearly frequently enough to account for the rapid pace of change unfolding in today’s digital environment. All militaries have plans for different kinds of scenarios and contingencies, but few of these plans are tested in advance. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, simulation systems vary widely depending on what someone is trying to simulate. The major factors that affect a simulation are its size and scale (typically the number of objects being handled), the fidelity of each object (what level of detail do you simulate), and the resources you are willing to throw at an object. For instance, a first-person shooter game can act as a simulation for a relatively small number of soldiers in very high fidelity. The gun’s operating can be replicated extremely accurately, along with a highly realistic small-scale simulation environment. On the other hand, complexity increases exponentially when attempting to run a simulation across the entire Indo-Pacific theater, with thousands of weapon systems and objects all interacting dynamically. Such a simulation would be incredibly complex, expensive, and probably unfeasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second is the actual setup of the simulation itself. In almost every case, actual operational systems are not used for simulation — meaning real-world operational data is rarely ported over to the simulation systems. Even when this happens, the data transfer is complex, hindered by data size and protection of classified information. This creates very high barriers to entry that are extremely hard to bridge. One such example is how the military services have been working for the past decade on ways to integrate live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) weapon systems. The Air Force’s Virtual Flag program, for example, was designed from the beginning as a LVC joint and combined exercise. Despite considerable progress over the past few years, Virtual Flag still suffers from the combined challenges of scale, integration of multi-level classified systems, and fidelity. One promising option is to find ways to easily export or pull information from operational systems into simulation systems that have been designed to handle low-fidelity/high object-count or high-fidelity/low object-count simulations — essentially a dial that someone can use to manage the trade-off between these choices. Once built, it would make sense not only to be able to run testing and verification on top of these systems, but also to include concepts such as “Chaos Monkey” (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operational and contingency plans (to include branches and sequels) can also be described and explored as part of the system. There are numerous extremely lucrative technologies such as generative adversarial networks and digital twinning that can be built and run on these platforms. This approach would allow the DOD to use AI-enabled technologies and other capabilities to test different adversarial strategies and techniques, as well as explore ways to counter them (some of the most promising work in this area includes game-theoretic competitions). The problem is that these can only be developed if the DOD has the right platforms, designed with the right APIs, upon which to build. So far, this remains much more of a pipe dream than reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-design-for-failure-and-let-the-chaos-monkey-loose&quot;&gt;Concept: Design for Failure and Let the Chaos Monkey Loose&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix built an open-source product called “Chaos Monkey” it used for testing complex and highly available software systems. Like a crazy monkey having a good time, it would randomly kill parts of a software system to see if they would recover and continue running. This has now been expanded to include the “Simian Army” family of tools that expand the testing concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running Chaos Monkey on your software is the equivalent of the “power-cord test” in a physical data center — essentially, randomly pulling a power cord of a running computer system or router to see if all the high-availability features of the site remain operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD should consider Chaos Monkey in two forms: first as a traditional testing product that the Department can use to test its backbone with warfighting software systems and, second, to test warfighting plans in a simulation environment to see how they actually unfold in situations characterized by random and uncontrollable changes (the inevitable friction that happens in the real world). Both approaches would allow the DOD to begin to design more for resiliency and anti-fragility than for optimizing performance under the kind of perfect conditions that simply never exist. This is, of course, only possible if the DOD can build software simulation systems that accurately represent its fielded systems under the full spectrum of realistic operating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-build-autonomy-and-automation-at-the-edge&quot;&gt;Concept: Build Autonomy and Automation at the Edge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When any system is software defined, it is typically the case that the control path and data path are pulled apart. Control becomes centralized, leaving the actual endpoint system to execute its mission with complex control logic, driving up cost and complexity. It is obviously not realistic or optimal for every small control decision to be made centrally. The latency between the endpoint and central control logic would be too high, and if the communication link were severed, the endpoint could not continue to function. This is also a case where the types of endpoints found in a military context (such as an aircraft, vehicle, or ship) are much larger and more complex than a typical computer network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument against this architecture is that if both the larger and smaller systems require manual management, then simple math shows that the DOD will require many more people to scale because it has more systems. As a matter of fact, the limiting factor in drone flights today are the crews to pilot the craft, not the actual hardware. For instance, each MQ-1 Predator or MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) system requires a pilot and sensor operator, along with a fairly large behind-the-scenes team of maintenance personnel and intelligence analysts (up to about 100 people total). As a business model, this does not scale well at all, as even with a relatively inexpensive piece of hardware, the human cost of operating the system remains quite high. Adding UAVs to the current architecture — wherein one pilot flies a single RPA — does not yield much of a cost or operating advantage (that is, there are relatively limited economies of scale). If anything, the DOD ends up with negative economies of scale: as the Department flies more systems, the harder and more expensive operating each aircraft gets. Unless they have an infinite supply of money, commercial companies with negative economies of scale quickly go out of business. The way around this is to figure out how to remove the expensive overhead of human involvement through more automation and autonomy, up to and including AI-enabled systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granting autonomy to these endpoint systems seems to run counter to the entire discussion of centralizing control through orchestration. The right way to think about it is to consider the scope of orchestration any particular system needs to have. An individual drone, for instance, should be responsible for the autonomy functions that are relevant to it, including taking off, landing, flying, and some route planning. If it is programmed to perform a certain function — perhaps identifying and tracking certain objects — then it should also be able to perform those functions without extensive human intervention or a central control system managing even the smallest tasks. But a single drone should not be responsible for orchestrating the functions of hundreds of other drones, nor should it be responsible for coordinating between a swarm of drones and armored vehicles on the ground. Those orchestration functions should be done by levels of software above, with a singular endpoint playing the right role and function within the broader context of all the systems being orchestrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concept-integrate-development-environments-with-production&quot;&gt;Concept: Integrate Development Environments with Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the DOD’s core code-development environments are not tightly integrated with the deployment of this code at the endpoints. The Department has an entire spectrum of development environments that are all trying to address similar issues, but there are no simple pathways from code development — which is done in these specific enclaves — to production environments. It will be even more challenging to deploy code to an actual endpoint (a piece of hardware such as a drone, ship, vehicle, or manned aircraft). While these types of deployments are not trivial, given that they require substantial pre-deployment testing and evaluation, accelerating this development–production–fielding–sustainment cycle will be critical to future success and gaining a competitive battlespace advantage. This underscores an earlier critical point: whereas the DOD could once claim the mantle of being bigger than anyone in the world and, as such, could rationalize refusing to adhere to commercial best practices, today the world’s biggest tech companies deal with eye-watering speeds and scale well beyond anything the DOD regularly sees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containerization, which allows for the right packaging of code that can be “sealed” and deployed to the endpoints in a predictable manner, plays an important enabler role. This will require endpoint system developers to enable newer systems to handle containers and to build these systems to be receptive targets of development, security, and operations processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This becomes even more important when a capability such as AI is integrated into these systems. Unlike traditional software, AI software is never done. The more operationally relevant data that is gathered and the more that an AI-based system performs in the operational environment, the more retraining and updating is needed. This loop of gathering data, retraining, and redeploying code is an important one to master and can only be enabled if these development environments are built the right way, with consideration of the end production environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;putting-it-all-together&quot;&gt;Putting It All Together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying these core principles across the DOD can seem impossible. Large technology transformations at legacy, industrial-era organizations present seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Indeed, most of the successful examples of organizations that adopted the aforementioned software best practices have involved digital-native companies that did not have to deal with legacy systems. And these companies almost never faced the byzantine DOD, in which there are thousands of hardware and software systems built by hundreds of different vendors, few of whom had to adhere to any core architectural standards that would be considered commercial software best practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report provides a blueprint for the way forward. The DOD should adopt these core concepts as it designs, develops, fields, and sustains all its weapon systems and supporting hardware. Think of a software “core” with an outer hardware “shell” — in essence, running the logic, planning, and optimization in the software plane, with the hardware tethered to the end of a long chain of software. In this idealized architecture, end-to-end software architecture connects all the relevant sensors (inputs) and outputs (weapons systems). It would also make it easier to model all the right workflows (kill chains), along with predictive intelligence systems, logistics, targeting, and fires, all of which would be integrated into a single architecture built on a few large-scale core platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of all these large networks of systems — whether autonomous or manually controlled — will be complex, internet-scale, highly available software that pulls everything together. The underlying software systems will help bind all the DOD’s people, weapons, logistics, and intelligence — and, equally important, pull together the Department’s development and production environments to allow for more rapid code development, deployment, and sustainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two critical steps required to pull off this kind of transformation. First, the larger problem needs to be broken down into smaller and smaller parts that are independent, allowing the creation of structured interfaces and APIs around them. This is especially important since each armed service runs its own infrastructure and applications, which will probably be the first to be cut, followed by segments underneath them. Second, the DOD should build the core scaffolding around which the other parts of the system can be “glued on” over time. Such a “loosely coupled, highly aligned” architecture could be expanded over time by bringing over and integrating more parts into the system instead of trying to upgrade or rewrite every part of the problem at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4i8REz7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Aspirational Core System Architecture for Software-Defined Warfare.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Designed by Nand Mulchandani&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As emphasized earlier, the most important part of this process will be to define an overall architecture with the right interfaces and abstractions. In addition, the DOD should use well-established and proven industry-standard and open-source best practices to build these types of interfaces (APIs, REST), data-exchange formats (JSON, XML), storage and representation methods (time-series databases, event/pipeline management systems), application packaging (containers), and the runtime architecture (microservices). At the same time, this approach should disconnect the data platform from the application logic, as well as the user interface and presentation services from the backend data and application logic (through APIs and other interfaces). This will allow each layer of the system to evolve independently without having to build a highly interconnected but fragile stack wherein even small changes will ripple through the architecture to every part of the system, making code updates extremely hard and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the DOD’s software architecture should be various software platforms to be built and operated across the department. These platforms provide a necessary divide between the data/core-logic layers and the applications. Separating the two provides an environment in which building a new application is dramatically simplified since all the heavy lifting of aggregating, cleaning, and integrating data is already done at the platform level. Additionally, the DOD should insist that any vendor implementing a platform and APIs build these as open interfaces that are well documented, version controlled, rent free, and availably freely to any vendor who wants to build upon them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this happens, the application writer need only be concerned about their own application logic, as they can freely rely upon any of these backend platform services for data and some common logic. Since they will not have to re-import, clean, and rebuild the entire data environment from scratch and recode common business logic, they will be able to rapidly build new functionality at a dramatically lower cost. Multiple vendors can also build competing products on the platform, driving down costs and increasing the quality of the applications for the DOD customer. Finally, when the Department owns the interfaces (the APIs, not the actual applications themselves), vendor lock-in will be lessened: no vendor will be able to hold the customer (DOD) hostage since all the data is captive in a system, with no way of exporting or accessing it. This is known as the “Roach Motel” problem, in honor of an aggressive late-night infomercial focused on cockroach removal that boasted, “Roaches check in, but they don’t check out!” The problem in this case is that data does not check out. In addition to enabling external vendors to build new applications, this architecture would also make it dramatically easier for internal DOD coders and data scientists to build smaller applications rapidly or enable new analytics on top of existing data. The same barrier of cleaning, importing, and normalizing data that exists for a smaller vendor is even larger for an individual internal developer. Immediately opening this up to the broader internal developer community will likely spur a dramatic increase in the kind of “micro applications” that are simply not developed today due to high costs and high barriers to entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warfighting has always been viewed as some esoteric combination of art and science that is incredibly complex to manage. The size, scale, and speed with which events take place and change continuously, even chaotically, can make it seem nearly impossible to master either the art or the science. In the future, warfighting will only become more complex, even more chaotic, and even faster. The art side of the art-science equation remains as important as ever. However, with the proliferation of new technologies and a shift to a data-centric world, the science part of the equation is becoming increasingly consequential. In future crises and conflicts, the side that adapts faster and demonstrates the greatest agility — to include rapidly updating and promulgating fielded software and AI models — is likely to gain a significant competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way for the DOD to stay competitive in this new warfighting environment is to ensure that it uses the most potent weapon available: technology, and more specifically, software. The commercial computer industry used to manage data centers the way the DOD has always conducted warfighting but realized that it did not scale. The industry came up with new tools and technologies to virtualize, automate, monitor, and scale data centers, which in turn have allowed the industry to offer services at a fraction of the cost with almost no downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest challenges the DOD and other U.S. federal agencies face is that they were built from the ground up as industrial-age, hardware-centric organizations. Making the transition to digital-age, software-centric, more risk-tolerant organizations is exceedingly difficult. But it is also the only path to future success. The template exists; implementation is now the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many of these concepts from the software industry may not have perfect analogues to military hardware and warfighting, it is important to understand the core concepts outlined in this paper and the effects they have on architecting large-scale, complex systems. The key is to begin thinking of military objects and hardware as part of a larger system that is woven together using software. This will not only prevent the most expensive and scarce resources from being subject to mind-numbing legacy workflow processes but will also dramatically accelerate information and decision cycles. At the same time, by automating most of the routine, mundane functions that currently absorb far too much of everyone’s time, implementing these software best practices will allow military leaders to spend more time focusing on the critical decisions they need to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software-defined warfare is the way of the future. Of course, this should never mean that humans are redundant or uninvolved. To the contrary, the approach described in this report opens up incredible new opportunities for human-machine teamwork, in which the roles of humans and machines are optimized based upon what each does best. Business objectives, goals, and the overall architecture of the systems are still all set by humans. The actual operations are handled by software, based on parameters established by humans. Any exceptional conditions or issues are still escalated to humans. The best way to characterize this change is to “take the robot out of the human” by electronically connecting end-to-end processes, leaving the human with the time to concentrate on making the most important and consequential decisions. In a fully AI-enabled future, UI/UX will advance to the point where users will train smart machines so systems can adapt to an individual’s performance, the pace of their cognitive development, and even their past behaviors. Given the state of its hardware and software, there is no possible way the DOD can do this today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wish the best for our country and, in our time at the Department of Defense, have tried our best to institute and implement best practices to orient the United States in this new direction. We hope this work continues and these ideas continue to make their way into the thinking and design of our next-generation warfighting systems.&lt;/p&gt;

But how are sanctions seen from within the country?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imposition of Western sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been swift, coordinated and widespread. Russian banks have been decoupled from international payment systems and capital markets; the Russian Central Bank’s international reserves have been frozen; hundreds of Russian companies and individuals have been targeted; and there has been a ban on certain strategic exports and imports. Furthermore, over a thousand companies with operations across Russia have “self-sanctioned”, closing or selling their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western narrative on the impact of sanctions is one of significant economic contraction. The IMF projects a decline in Russia’s real GDP of 6% in 2022 and leading Yale academics have concluded that the “Russian economy is reeling”, while certain politicians have called for Russia’s economy to be pushed “back into the Soviet era”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is the Russian perspective and narrative in response to these sanctions, how is their impact viewed from Moscow and across Russia’s 11 time zones, and what implications does this have for future Western policymaking as the fighting in Ukraine continues unabated? There are signs that Russian opinion is split between those who support the Kremlin and those who question its assessments. The Kremlin’s rhetoric is stoic and its message is confident, articulating economic resilience and a clear way forward in response to sanctions. In contrast, public non-conformist views, which are difficult to source because of censorship, present a more bearish perspective of the long-term consequences of sanctions, especially as they move beyond targeting Putin’s supporters to impacting the real economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia-remains-strong-and-is-only-defending-itself-against-the-west&quot;&gt;Russia Remains Strong, and is Only Defending Itself Against the West&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to sanctions, the narrative from the Kremlin focuses on two main messages. The first is that the Russian economy is resilient and well-prepared for Western sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin has been thorough in relaying a composed message of strength to the Russian public through all forms of state-controlled media, expressing continued confidence in the country and its economy in the face of sanctions, and emphasising the government’s “responsible macroeconomic policy over the past few years”. The policy of redirecting resources to serve domestic markets after international companies pulled out of the country; the lending programme to fund “much-needed initiatives and projects worth around half a trillion roubles”; and the provision of increased liquidity to the economy are but a few examples of the steps the Kremlin and the Russian Central Bank have taken to mitigate the short-term impact of sanctions. Russian companies have also sought to put risk mitigation measures in place by seeking alternate markets to replace exports to the EU, and Russia is portrayed as effortlessly making new connections with other countries sympathetic to its cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexei Miller, Chairman of the Board of Gazprom, has spoken of Russia’s ability to replace the exports to European markets it has lost through the strengthening of pro-Russian alliances with countries such as China and Saudi Arabia. Miller has highlighted global inflation and price volatility as evidence of Western mistakes and believes this will only worsen over time. Miller has also commented that the sanctioning of Gazprom has given the Russian oil industry the opportunity to create “new fuel and energy unions” with other countries including India and China. Miller has asserted that Russia ultimately has “energy security” and the ability now to “determine the course of future alliances”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Support from the religious establishment in Russia provides Putin with a halo of spiritual blessing and a deep-rooted religious anchor to justify the conflict in Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Kremlin focuses on the belligerence and provocation of Western countries in imposing sanctions and their desire to halt the Russian economy at all costs, with Putin describing the sanctions against Russia as “akin to an act of war”. The West is portrayed as the aggressor with Russia only defending itself, as underlined by Putin in a televised address in which he stated that Western politicians have consistently created “fundamental threats” to Russia. As a result, he believes he had no choice but to begin the “special military operation” and take “bold and immediate action” in Ukraine. Putin has called Western leaders “short-sighted Russophobes” who are prepared to cause damage to Russia and other countries to “preserve their own global dominance”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This message is echoed by State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin, who believes the “range of means aimed at withholding [Russia’s] development [to have been] exhausted.” The depiction of the West as the aggressor is prevalent, as further exemplified by government officials such as Dmitri Peskov, diplomat and Putin’s press secretary, who, in regard to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control’s measures to prevent payments on Russia’s sovereign bonds, commented that “a default can be orchestrated, but this is a purely artificial situation created by the US Treasury and not due to any economic difficulty in Russia”. In other words, the West is choosing to wage economic war on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative of sanctions as a tool of aggression and Western belligerence threatening Russia’s security is being widely amplified by Russian radio and TV networks. The popular channel RT News consistently refers in its broadcasts to NATO doing “everything to provoke Russia”, and women have even posted videos on social media in which they cut up their designer handbags as a sign of resentment against the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;patriarchs-support-for-gods-truth&quot;&gt;Patriarch’s Support for God’s Truth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patriarch Kirill and the senior echelons of the Russian Orthodox Church have also shown support for Putin’s “special military operation” in Ukraine. This support from the religious establishment in Russia provides Putin with a halo of spiritual blessing and a deep-rooted religious anchor to justify the conflict in Ukraine. In March 2022, Patriarch Kirill claimed to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation that Russians and Ukrainians come from “a single Kyiv baptismal font” which is united “by a common historical destiny”. Kirill also spoke of the “external hostile political forces” that have been used “to escalate Russian-Ukrainian hostility”, echoing the narrative of Putin’s preparatory essay from July 2021, “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of Western provocation has also been reflected by senior members of the Russian Orthodox Church in their rejection of the sanctions placed on the Patriarch for his support of the war. Vladimir Legoyda, acting head of the press service for the Russian Orthodox Church, has stated that the UK sanctions against Patriarch Kirill are “against common sense” and “absurd and futile”, accusing the UK of unsuccessfully attempting “to intimidate the Primate of the Russian Church” and of burning even the “last bridge” in communication between the two countries. Similarly, the Patriarchal Exarch of Africa, Metropolitan Leonid of Klin, has said the Canadian sanctions are an example of the West creating havoc wherever it can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Despite the Kremlin’s assertion that the Russian economy is resilient, the measures taken by the Central Bank to mitigate the effect of sanctions suggest otherwise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this vocal support for the Kremlin and condemnation of Western sanctions, there is anecdotal evidence that the Russian Orthodox Church is not united in its support of Putin (the church in Ukraine has already broken ranks publicly). Kirill’s position is seen by some in the Church in Russia as contrary to the Christian view that “the life of every human is valuable”. In March 2022, 233 Russian Orthodox clerics signed an “Appeal of the priests of the Russian Orthodox Church” that called for reconciliation, a ceasefire and an end to war, showing that they do not condone Kirill’s blessing of the conflict. In another example, after speaking out for peace, John Burdin, a priest in the Kostroma village of Karabanovo, was reported by his parishioners for not supporting the war and later questioned in jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-west-is-only-hurting-itself&quot;&gt;The West is Only Hurting Itself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A separate narrative being promoted by the Kremlin both domestically and internationally is that the West is causing more economic damage to itself than to Russia, as Europe will not easily be able to source replacements for imports of energy from Russia. Volodin believes that “new packages of sanctions will not do Europe any good” and are “illegal”, and has sought to blame Presidents Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelensky for actions that will lead to famine. This attribution of blame and depiction of Europe as suffering more than Russia is further amplified by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who has introduced the idea of the “new poor” in Europe, where “living standards are deteriorating” as a result of the West’s own actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin himself states that the “global crisis [of food and energy] is largely caused by these sanctions” and paints the EU as disunited, in contrast to Russia which is depicted as a strong and clear-minded nation – a narrative underlined during Lavrov’s tour of Africa, which cultivated unity in the face of suffering at the hands of Western sanctions. Emphasising the West’s dependence on Russian energy, Putin maintains that sanctions come at the “expense of [Europe’s] own national interest”, a view corroborated by figures such as opposition politician and economist Vladimir Milov, who talks of Putin’s ability to “finance his economy and the ongoing military aggression” as long as there is not a complete embargo on Russia’s oil resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-collapse-but-decay&quot;&gt;Not Collapse but Decay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the Kremlin’s assertion that the Russian economy is resilient, the measures taken by the Central Bank to mitigate the effect of sanctions suggest otherwise. For example, capital controls, subsidised lending programmes for small businesses, and expected legal action by the Central Bank against the freezing of its offshore international reserves reveal an economy under stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conformists and non-conformists in Russia agree that a major economic meltdown is unlikely. However, non-conformists seem more fearful of the long-term economic impact of sanctions, as industries with a reliance on Western products suffer and the rate of Western production cannot be replicated domestically. Valery Kizilov from The Insider Journal acknowledges the very significant effect sanctions will have on the financial sector, which will in turn directly affect other sectors such as housing and construction; the motor industry, which is reliant on key Western components; and the scientific sector, where international deals on equipment and collaboration – once prevalent – have now been suspended. All of this points to a more gradual deterioration and a future where economic hardship will increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This more fearful reaction to sanctions is echoed by economists such as Ruben Enikolopov, director of the Russian Economic School, who believes that Russia’s isolation is now “worse than in the Soviet Union”, maintaining that while there will not be a market collapse as in 1991, there will be a scarcity of international products. Sergei Hestanov, a well-known Russian economist, believes that the sanctions are just the “tip of the iceberg”, alluding to suffering to come under the new restrictions. Oil expert Michael Krytikin agrees with Milov that Russia is only relatively secure as long as the West is reliant on its oil and gas products, but that once the West imposes a full oil embargo, the Russian economy will suffer a substantial hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of the economy to sustain itself through its reliance on oil and natural gas revenues is also a very real fear among ordinary citizens. In interviews on the popular Russian YouTube channel 1420, ordinary Russians express their concern that once the West no longer needs to purchase its natural resources, Russia will have little else to offer. This fear of eventual “not collapse, but decay” of the Russian economy, and the resulting impact on the quality of Russian life caused by a rise in economic challenges, is the core non-conformist view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s ability to control the narrative through state-controlled media, the criminalisation of anti-war protests, and the continued flow of energy revenues have allowed Putin to deflect the impact of sanctions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonid Volkov, top aide to imprisoned Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, believes that by starting the war Putin has “shortened his time in power”. Navalny himself additionally claims that the war was started to distract from financial problems within the country that will lead to “destroyed lives and continued impoverishment of Russian people”. Whatever the reason, there is no doubt that while the Kremlin points to resilience against sanctions in Russia today and economic challenges in the West, the future of the Russian economy will be determined by the extent to which these fears materialise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-more-promising-future-elsewhere&quot;&gt;A More Promising Future Elsewhere?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the impact of propaganda, censorship and new legislative measures to criminalise anti-war protests makes it challenging to research the impact of sanctions on ordinary Russians and their resulting perceptions, other factors such as the “brain drain” that hit Russia after the first wave of sanctions point to growing concerns for the future. Current Time TV estimates that 15,000 millionaires will leave Russia this year, and Yulia Florinskaya, researcher at RANEPA, reports the exit of about 150,000 people, many of them educated young professionals working in the hi-tech, medical and business sectors. Despite the economy not crashing, many have not returned, which Florinskaya refers to as “forced migration”, demonstrating the continued fear that sanctions will affect people’s quality of life and opportunities and Russia’s economic future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-implications&quot;&gt;Policy Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imposition of sanctions on Russia was framed by many in the West as a “shock and awe” campaign. It was hoped that the threat of massive economic consequences by Western leaders would change Putin’s calculus. The reality was always going to be different. Sanctions are a long-term tool that seek to build pressure over time. Unsurprisingly, Western-imposed sanctions are not triggering the extent of public opposition in Russia to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine that Western leaders sought, because – for now – the country’s economy remains superficially resilient, foreign currency revenues from the sale of oil and gas continue to fill the Kremlin’s coffers, and censorship silences dissent. But fears of the longer-term economic impact on the country are beginning to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s narrative will continue to highlight Russia’s economic resilience in contrast to the West and seek to frame sanctions as a tool of Western belligerence, thereby reinforcing his claim that Russia’s security is constantly threatened and that the invasion of Ukraine was in self-defence. But as evidence of economic stagnation emerges, this version of the truth could become increasingly difficult to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Putin’s “special military operation” extends beyond six months, the ability of the Kremlin to control the narrative through state-controlled media, the criminalisation of anti-war protests, and the continued flow of energy revenues have allowed Putin to deflect the impact of sanctions. The West should ensure that it monitors and reports on the true effect of sanctions on the Russian economy, that it blunts the Kremlin narrative which seeks to portray sanctions as more harmful to the West than Russia, and that it maintains economic pressure on the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That economic hardship lies ahead in the West as a result of its support of Ukraine is certain, particularly until alternative sources of energy can be found; but Ukraine’s allies must stay the course, given the fundamental threat Russia’s war in Ukraine poses to Western security and democracy, until the economic reality in Russia undermines the Kremlin’s post-truth narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 29 August, Ukrainian forces significantly stepped up the intensity of their attacks on Russian positions around the city of Kherson. After months of discussion about a Ukrainian counteroffensive, this has precipitated a deluge of speculation about Ukrainian objectives and intentions. It would be inappropriate to discuss the specifics of Ukrainian planning, but it is important to establish reasonable expectations so that observers can accurately assess success or failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is contending with three conflicting imperatives. Firstly, there is a political demand to demonstrate to Ukraine’s international partners that the donation of equipment leads to progress on the battlefield ahead of a challenging winter in which many states will be seeking to curtail expenditure. Secondly, there is the need to continually disrupt Russian forces occupying Ukraine so that they can neither regain the initiative nor consolidate their control of the country. Thirdly, there is the ultimate aim of driving the Russians from Ukrainian soil through a deliberate offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these objectives requires the immediate expenditure of a high volume of resources to bring about quick results. The second depends upon the prolonged expenditure of resources at moderate intensity. The third necessitates the husbanding of personnel and materiel until a critical mass of units are available. Major offensive operations require a large pool of reserves because even if a small force is able to breach the lines of an adversary, exploiting that breach to occupy large areas of territory calls for fresh troops to be surged forwards following the breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-kherson-front&quot;&gt;The Kherson Front&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kherson Oblast offers an opportunity to reconcile the conflicting imperatives outlined above. As the city is predominantly on the western bank of the Dnipro, Russian forces there can be pushed up against the river, and as they become more concentrated they will also be more vulnerable to attrition from artillery. The river, meanwhile, prevents the Russians from counterattacking in the Ukrainian’s flank, and interdiction of supplies moving across Kherson’s bridges can prevent the city’s defenders from being effectively circulated or reinforced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With the prospect of a bitter winter spent outdoors, there is ample opportunity to ensure that Russia’s forces remain cold, wet, hungry, miserable and therefore vulnerable to shock and a collapse in morale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Ukrainians can expend a limited amount of their combat power to pen the Russians into the city, they can reverse the challenges they faced in Severodonetsk and create a killing area for a large portion of Russia’s best assault troops – primarily airborne forces – who will be fixed defending a politically critical position even as it becomes militarily untenable. In this scenario, the Russian leadership must either contend with the progressive degradation of their assault troops at a time when they are desperately short of motivated infantry, or make a ‘goodwill gesture’ and withdraw – in the process suffering a heavy symbolic defeat, as Kherson is one of only two cities that were occupied largely intact during Russia’s war against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, unless the Ukrainians want to expend scarce reserves needed for wider offensive operations, or unless Russian units collapse owing to abysmal morale – which is possible but not something that can be assumed in planning – a deliberate storming of Kherson city would likely be a mistake. Furthermore, seizing Kherson – while politically significant – would not enable rapid exploitation operations to occupy territory on the east bank of the Dnipro, because the Ukrainians would suffer from the same challenges with supplies over a small number of damaged bridges as the Russians, and would therefore risk outrunning their artillery support. Success, therefore, looks like a methodical driving in of Russian positions followed by the affliction of heavy attrition on the Russians. Moreover, the Kherson offensive should be seen as limited in its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reclaiming-the-east&quot;&gt;Reclaiming the East&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conduct of a broader offensive to liberate occupied oblasts east of the Dnipro is a separate question to operations against Kherson. Any assessment of the amount of ground involved must lead to the conclusion that the Ukrainian armed forces need time to build up sufficient manoeuvre units. Combined with the hiatus in manoeuvre to be imposed by winter, these operations are most likely to take place through 2023. This, of course, also gives the Russians time to mobilise and train new units. These could either pre-empt a Ukrainian offensive or be used for a Russian counteroffensive to dislocate Ukraine’s attempt to liberate its territory. For this reason, it is important that Ukraine forces Russia to commit new units through the winter to hold its current positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may therefore understand Ukrainian offensive operations to be implemented in three broad phases: the Kherson offensive, a protracted period of asymmetric skirmishing and deep strikes to disrupt Russia’s occupation and demoralise its troops, and a period of major combat operations in 2023. It is clear that the Russians have come to the same conclusion. This is why they have significantly reduced attempts to conduct further offensive operations and are instead trying to conserve their combat power while regenerating new units, which Putin has suggested will be available coming out of winter. With the prospect of a bitter winter spent outdoors, there is ample opportunity to ensure that Russia’s forces remain cold, wet, hungry, miserable and therefore vulnerable to shock and a collapse in morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Convincing the Russians to negotiate seriously requires demonstrating to them that military defeat – and not just a stalemate – is entirely plausible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A period of winter skirmishing also holds out the prospect of significant unconventional warfare. Ukraine – like the rest of Europe – is looking at the prospect of energy and fuel shortages. Unlike states not at war, however, many of its citizens lack homes, and much infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. The Russians will work hard to stir up criticism of the Ukrainian government from within, just as they will use propaganda and agents of influence to argue that Western governments should spend money at home rather than in support of Ukraine. This is a false dichotomy, but given Ukraine’s dependence upon Western financing and ammunition, one of Russia’s theories of victory centres on breaking support for Ukraine this winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prospects-matter&quot;&gt;Prospects Matter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that offensive operations to liberate occupied territories are likely to run through 2023 and are dependent upon Western aid, it is important that Ukraine’s international partners stop periodic announcements about specific lists of equipment and instead articulate a longer-term commitment to structural aid out to 2024. The reasons for this are straightforward. Firstly, it would remove the political pressure from the Ukrainian government to expend combat power to make short-term gains at the expense of longer-term prospects. Secondly, it would generate more realistic expectations among Western publics about the duration and impact of the conflict, and therefore reduce their vulnerability to Russian propaganda. Thirdly, and most importantly, it would show the Russians that their prospects are deteriorating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of Russia’s willingness to grind on in the face of setbacks has been premised upon a belief – and perhaps a self-deluding hope – that Western support for Ukraine will fade. If this war is to end, it is vital that the Russian leadership understand that in the medium to long term their position on the ground will get worse, the capability gap between their forces and the Ukrainian military will expand, and the gap between their rhetoric and the reality will become insurmountable. In this context, public commitments to provide Ukraine with combat aircraft like Gripen may take a year to come to fruition, but the impact of such a long-term commitment on the Russian government should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As during the assault on Kyiv or the abandonment of Snake Island, Russia’s leadership have demonstrated that they are prepared to desist when they see a bigger failure looming on the horizon. There are a number of Western academics and former officers calling for negotiations with Russia. There is nothing wrong with negotiations, but treating them as separate from fighting is ahistorical and immature. There is no reason why negotiations need take place from a presumption of weakness. Convincing the Russians to negotiate seriously requires demonstrating to them that military defeat – and not just a stalemate – is entirely plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

The two countries have so far eschewed a formal alliance, but they share deep military ties centering on arms sales and joint military exercises.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Russian arms sales to China have been invaluable to China’s efforts to rapidly modernize the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Joint military exercises have likewise aided the PLA and offered Beijing a suite of other benefits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet military ties between Beijing and Moscow are not without considerable hiccups. China’s repeated theft of Russian technology is a major sore spot, and arms sales are becoming a less important focal point of the broader bilateral relationship. With respect to joint exercises, shifting power dynamics between China and Russia are upsetting the status quo with mixed results for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-aid-and-arms-sales&quot;&gt;Military Aid and Arms Sales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the decades, cooperation on military technology has at times been an important and symbolic element of China-Russia relations. Politically, Russian military aid and arms sales have helped undergird the broader diplomatic relationship. Militarily, arms sales have provided the PLA with equipment that it struggled to produce on its own, like advanced aircraft, engines, and air defense systems. However, China has repeatedly stolen Russian technology and know-how, creating friction between Beijing and Moscow. Going forward, arms sales could become a less important area of the relationship or even become a point of contention as China advances and competes with Russia in the global arms industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ebb-and-flow-of-russian-military-aid-and-arms-sales&quot;&gt;The Ebb and Flow of Russian Military Aid and Arms Sales&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military aid and arms sales played a major role in cementing ties between the newly founded People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union. After entering the Korean War in October 1950, China suffered heavy losses and turned to the Soviets for aid. In October 1951, Moscow agreed to provide massive amounts of equipment and assistance from Soviet experts. Soviet aid included around 700 MiG-15 fighter jets and 150 Tu-2 light bombers and effectively tripled the size of China’s air force fleet. In total, Chinese historical data suggests the Soviets provided the equivalent of $1.5–2 billion worth of aid during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Union also abetted China’s nuclear development, for both civilian and military purposes. Soviet aid included training Chinese scientists, supporting China’s weapons-grade uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing, and assisting with warhead design and production and missile technologies. The Soviets, however, stopped short of directly providing China with nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This massive influx of Soviet aid catalyzed China’s indigenous weapons production. Moscow encouraged and assisted Chinese production through licensing and technical support, and by 1956 China was producing the J-4, its first indigenous combat aircraft modeled on the Soviet MiG-17. China likewise leveraged Russian aid to eventually develop its first successful atomic bomb by 1964.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this military cooperation did not last. By 1960, ideological and political differences resulted in the Sino-Soviet Split, which effectively lasted until the normalization of relations in 1989. During this period, the two countries ceased virtually all forms of military aid and arms sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hW6jzwT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Chinese Arms Purchases from the Soviet Union/Russia (1950-2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the resumption of normal relations between Beijing and Moscow in 1989, arms sales again played a major role in strengthening political ties between the two sides. The Soviet Union was one of the only major arms-producing countries willing to sell weapons to China after the deadly crackdown on protestors in Tiananmen Square in 1989, which left Beijing an international pariah. The benefits were not one-sided. Chinese arms purchases were a lifeline for Russia’s defense industry in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian arms sales to China burgeoned in the 1990s and early 2000s. Some of the most big-ticket purchases were of Russian fighter aircraft. According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), between 1990 and 2005 China placed several orders for some 270 Su-27 and Su-30 fighters at a cost of approximately $10-11 billion. In the years following the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis — during which China’s navy was outmatched by U.S. naval forces in the region — Beijing ordered eight Russian Kilo-class diesel-powered submarines and four Sovremenny-class destroyers. China also bought thousands of missiles and several S-300 surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, among other equipment. Altogether, between 1990 and 2005, China purchased more than 83 percent of its arms imports from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the 1950s, this influx of major weapons systems in the 1990s and 2000s significantly aided the PLA by filling modernization gaps. Russia’s willingness to license production rights to China catalyzed the development of China’s own defense industry. By selling China kits of Russian aircraft parts, Chinese engineers gained manufacturing experience, which aided China in developing indigenous designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZcdYJJY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;problems-in-the-china-russia-arms-trade-relationship&quot;&gt;Problems in the China-Russia Arms Trade Relationship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a flurry of orders, Chinese arms purchases from Russia slowed to a trickle in the late 2000s. China’s overall arms imports were down 30 percent during the 2007-2021 period compared to 1992-2006. Declining orders from Russia drove much of this fall. China has procured around 71 percent of its arms imports from Russia since 2007 — a notable drop from 84 percent during the previous 15-year period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decline is partly the result of growing frustration with China’s repeated theft of Russian military technology and intellectual property through espionage and hacks. According to ChinaPower analysis, there have been at least 17 cases of Chinese espionage and hacking to steal Russian military technology during the last two decades. China has most heavily targeted Russian aerospace technologies. In 2004 alone, three court cases saw seven Russians convicted of providing China with information on Russian airplane and satellite technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espionage and hacks are only part of the story. China has frequently breached agreements with Russian arms suppliers by reverse-engineering Russian equipment to produce its own. China copied Russian Su-27 fighters to develop its J-11 fighter and it reverse-engineered S-300 SAM systems to produce its HQ-9 SAM systems. This has not gone unnoticed in Moscow. In 2019, Russian state-owned defense firm Rostec claimed that there had been 500 cases of unauthorized copying of its equipment in the preceding 17 years. In a rare move, the company publicly criticized China, stating that “‘China alone has copied aircraft engines, Sukhoi planes, deck jets, air defense systems, portable air defense missiles, and analogs of the Pantsir medium-range surface-to-air systems.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NOZAgRS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Timeline of Chinese Espionage and Technology Theft against Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative decline in Russian arms sales to China is also largely due to China’s shrinking reliance on foreign-made equipment. Decades of growing defense spending and intensive efforts to modernize its defense industry have rendered China increasingly capable of producing its own advanced fighter jets, naval vessels, and other equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China does notably still depend on Russian-made engines for many PLA aircraft. Over the last five years (2017-2021), aircraft engines accounted for more than 54 percent of China’s arms imports (by value), with the overwhelming majority coming from Russia. Some of China’s Chengdu J-20 stealth fighters are equipped with Russian Saturn AL-31 engines and versions of China’s developmental Shenyang J-35/FC-31 jet fighter have used Russian RD-93 engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WefUeoW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Recent Chinese Orders of Russian Aircraft Engines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China appears to be making headway toward replacing Russian engines. A domestically built WS-10C engine is reportedly being used in variants of the J-20, and new variants of the J-35/FC-31 are likely to be outfitted with Chinese WS-13E engines. Over the next decade, both planes are expected to feature more advanced Chinese-made engines, including the WS-15 and WS-19. China also aims to phase out the Russian Soloviev D-30KP-2 currently powering China’s Y-20 large transport aircraft and H-6K bombers and replace them with Chinese WS-18 engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-future-of-russian-arms-sales-to-china&quot;&gt;The Future of Russian Arms Sales to China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, several factors could render arms trade a source of contention and competition, rather than a platform for cooperation. The Chinese defense industry’s continued efforts toward self-reliance could result in the evaporation of Chinese arms purchases from Russia altogether. There has already been a marked slowdown in recent years. China last purchased military equipment (two orders of Mi-17 transport helicopters) from Russia in 2019 — a far cry from earlier years when China placed more than a dozen orders in a single year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if China does continue to purchase certain items, Russia may face challenges in supplying them. In 2020, Russia delayed delivery of its highly advanced S-400 SAM system to China, citing the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse. However, the move was seen by some as a diplomatic move by Moscow to avoid angering India — Russia’s top arms buyer — amid heightened tensions and border skirmishes between China and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine could further inhibit Russia from delivering orders to China. After Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, international sanctions on Russia disrupted Russia’s ability to deliver certain equipment to Vietnam, one of Russia’s top arm export markets. The severe sanctions placed on Russia in response to its 2022 invasion of Ukraine could further disrupt the Russian defense industry and limit its ability to fulfill large orders to China or other customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if China pushes to establish itself as a more dominant player in the global arms market, it could put significant pressure on the broader China-Russia relationship. Russia’s prominence in the global arms market has already declined steeply. In 2021, Russian arms exports plunged to 11 percent of the global total — the lowest point in decades and a steep fall from a high of 32 percent in 2002. So far, China has not made major gains in capturing global market share due to steep competition from more established actors, including the United States and Russia. Nevertheless, China may be able to use Russia’s war in Ukraine to make marginal gains in regions like the Middle East and North Africa. In the long-term, Beijing could become a more attractive arms supplier as developing countries look to diversify their suppliers away from just Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nBm9tcO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Share of Global Arm Sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, arms sales will likely remain a slightly diminished but positive element of the relationship. As China’s capabilities and influence grow, however, this could change and may ultimately become a thorny issue in the bilateral relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;joint-military-exercises&quot;&gt;Joint Military Exercises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike military aid and arms sales, which have waxed and waned over the years, joint exercises are a relatively new and thriving element of China-Russia military ties and a driver behind the strengthening of China-Russia relations in recent years. Joint military exercises provide China and the PLA with myriad benefits, such as operational experience and opportunities for deterrent signaling. These benefits could evolve or diminish, however, as China’s power grows and as Russia stagnates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-evolving-nature-of-china-russia-joint-exercises&quot;&gt;The Evolving Nature of China-Russia Joint Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia first participated in a military exercise together in 2003. The multilateral exercise, dubbed Coalition 2003, featured a series of counter-terrorism drills and brought together 1,300 troops from China, Russia, and three other members of the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Two years later, China and Russia held their first bilateral military exercise, known as Peace Mission 2005, which began in the Russian far eastern city of Vladivostok and moved to China’s Shandong Peninsula. The exercise was a major undertaking involving 8,000 Chinese troops and 2,000 Russian troops conducting both land and amphibious maneuvers. Exercises such as these, consisting of large ground or multi-domain operations, were the norm during the early years of China-Russia joint exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Faobkb2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China-Russia Joint Military Exercises by Type&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as China and Russia strengthened ties, they dramatically scaled up the number and type of exercises. In 2007, they conducted their first joint paramilitary exercise Cooperation 2007, focused on anti-terrorism drills, and in 2009 they held their first joint naval drills in the Gulf of Aden. Starting in 2014, China and Russia began to participate in large-scale competitions such as the Aviadarts air force competition and Tank Biathlon, both of which are now annual exercises. Since then, the two have further widened the aperture of their cooperation by participating in computer-based simulations and by conducting joint aerial patrols. Altogether, China and Russia participated in at least 78 joint military exercises between 2003 and mid-2022, with more than half of these taking place since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China-Russia joint exercises have also expanded in terms of geographic reach. Early exercises largely took place in the rugged terrains of western China and Central Asia, but more recent naval exercises saw the two operate in the distant waters of the South African coast, the Mediterranean Sea, and even as far as the Baltic Sea. Joint aerial patrols have likewise seen the two flying across broad swaths of the Western Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BK3AdTW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image7&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-china-benefits-from-joint-exercises-with-russia&quot;&gt;How China Benefits from Joint Exercises with Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China reaps many benefits from joint exercises with Russia. First and foremost, joint exercises have allowed the PLA to gain valuable experience operating with the far more experienced Russian military and afforded the PLA opportunities to practice maneuvering in a variety of geographies and climates far from China’s borders. These experiences are invaluable to the PLA, which has not engaged in large-scale military conflict in several decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint exercises provide additional benefits to China (and Russia) as a tool for sending political signals and deterring perceived adversaries. Chinese officials have long claimed that joint exercises do not target “third parties”; however, the 2020 edition of Science of Military Strategy — an authoritative textbook published by China’s National Defense University — states that an exercise “not only demonstrates the Chinese army’s combat capabilities to adversaries, but also causes doubts, making them uncertain about our intentions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, China and Russia have increasingly exploited joint exercises to signal to the United States and its allies. In September 2016, just two months after the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling that invalidated China’s claims over much of the South China Sea, China and Russia launched Joint Sea 2016, which featured island seizure operations in the South China Sea. It was their first and only naval exercise held there, sending a clear signal that it was a response to the tribunal’s ruling. More recently, in May 2022, China and Russia conducted a joint aerial patrol over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea that coincided with a summit of the leaders of the Quadrilateral Strategic Dialogue (also known as the Quad) in Tokyo. The move was widely seen as a direct response and intentional provocation in protest of the summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing also aims to use the exercises to positively signal to friends and neighbors. More than half of China-Russia exercises are multilateral. SCO members states and other neighbors participate in the lion’s share of these. These exercises help to both level up the military capabilities of these countries while also helping to assure them that China and Russia have the capability and will to aid them in addressing regional security threats. They also aim to ease worries in neighboring countries about Beijing’s own intentions, making the exercises an important element of China’s peripheral diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/55FsAVU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China-Russia Joint Military Exercise by Number of Participants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, joint military exercises help to strengthen the broader bilateral relationship by facilitating exchanges at multiple levels. The recent Zapad/Interaction 2021 exercises were viewed by Chinese experts as being unique in that the two sides not only jointly conducted the exercise but also collaborated in planning and commanding the exercises. More broadly, exercises have provided opportunities for Chinese military leaders — including vice chairs of China’s Central Military Commission and defense ministers — to meet with their Russian counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, exercises increase mutual trust and transparency by revealing to each other their respective capabilities. At Zapad/Interaction 2021, more than 80 percent of China’s equipment used in the exercise was new — including the PLA’s KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft, J-20 and J-16 fighters, Y-20 transport planes, and surveillance and combat drones — giving Russia a look at some of China’s most advanced systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-shifting-dynamics-of-china-russia-joint-exercises&quot;&gt;The Shifting Dynamics of China-Russia Joint Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits that China gains from joint exercises with Russia are changing as China-Russia power dynamics shifts. Chinese analysts increasingly emphasize China’s military capabilities are catching up with, or surpassing, Russia’s. One expert argues, for example, that Chinese battalion groups have surpassed their Russian counterparts in terms of weapons and equipment and that Russian battalion tactical groups “are only suitable for the kind of battlefield in East Ukraine… and are easily defeated on high-intensity battlefields by advanced adversaries like the U.S. military.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has even started to flip the status quo by leading exercises while Russia participates from a junior position. Official Chinese media described the Zapad/Interaction 2021 exercises as the first in which the PLA led, as well as the first joint exercises held entirely in China using mostly Chinese weaponry. Li Shuyin, a researcher at the Academy of Military Sciences, emphasized the uniqueness of Zapad/Interaction 2021, describing it as “a change of roles” and a chance to create a joint exercise “brand” centered on the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This emerging dynamic is likely to be cemented as China’s power grows and Russia stagnates. Russia’s war in Ukraine may accelerate this trend. The Russian military has surprised many by how poorly it has performed in Ukraine, and the conflict has proven costly and deadly for Russia. If Russia becomes deeply weakened and overstretched by the war, it may be unable to carry out frequent large-scale exercises. This may lead China to pivot toward smaller-scale exercises that are focused less on operational benefits and more on political signaling. The two sides could also continue with frequent exercises but with China more consistently leading as the senior partner. Alternately, if Beijing concludes that Russia’s performance in Ukraine has been bad enough, it may ultimately rethink the value of participating in joint exercises with Russia and even reconsider the overall value of strategic ties with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did China commit to the relationship at such a pivotal moment? Why did Beijing double down on the relationship by refusing to criticize the Russian invasion of Ukraine? This ChinaPower feature explores how the relationship came to be so close, up until the time of the invasion. This analysis centers on five key ways in which China benefits from the relationship, each of which is examined in detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia supports China’s core interests;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vladimir Putin personally supports Xi Jinping and his key initiatives;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia helps to magnify China’s global reach at the expense of Western influence;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia enhances China’s military power through arms sales and joint military exercises; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia assists China in meeting important economic and energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;supporting-chinas-core-interests&quot;&gt;Supporting China’s Core Interests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The China-Russia relationship is founded, first and foremost, on mutual respect and accommodation of each side’s core interests. For China, this means accepting China’s authoritarian political system, supporting (or not opposing) China’s sovereignty and territorial claims, and aiding China in maintaining stability on its periphery. Without these preconditions, the relationship would not be as close as it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Chinese and Russian political systems are meaningfully different, they share similar tendencies toward authoritarianism. Moscow’s acceptance and support of China’s basic political system, and its attempts to legitimize alternative, non-Western visions of democracy and human rights, made it possible for Russia to deepen relations with China as Western countries criticized Beijing on human rights issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also crucial to Beijing’s core interests is Russia’s support or acceptance of Chinese sovereignty claims. During the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, Moscow blamed Taiwan and the United States for heightened tensions and refrained from criticizing China for conducting military exercises and missile launches near Taiwan. In the 2001 China-Russia Treaty of Good Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, Russia endorsed Beijing’s One-China Principle and stated that it “opposes any form of Taiwan’s independence.” Russia has continued to support Beijing’s stance on Taiwan, including in the February 4, 2022, joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Taiwan, Moscow has supported Beijing’s draconian policies toward Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang, and it has even appeared to signal support for Chinese claims over the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands that Japan also claims — most notably through a joint China-Russia bomber patrol near the islands in 2019. Russia has remained officially neutral on disputed Chinese claims in the South China Sea, but it has tacitly supported China by criticizing “non-regional powers” (i.e., the United States) for involving themselves in the region, and Russia even joined China in a naval exercise in the South China Sea in 2016 after an international tribunal sided with the Philippines and ruled against Chinese claims in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has reciprocated by supporting or not opposing Russian activities and claims. Beijing has largely avoided criticizing Russian military activities in Chechnya, Georgia, Syria, and Ukraine, and it has tacitly sided with Russian claims over the Kuril Islands, which Japan disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has further supported Beijing’s core interests by cooperating with China to shape favorable security dynamics along their shared periphery. The two countries cooperated in the 1990s and 2000s to resolve their decades-old border dispute, which eliminated a long-existing irritant in the bilateral relationship and set the stage for the two nuclear neighbors to view each other as strategic partners instead of rivals. It also freed up Beijing’s political attention and military resources to focus on other pressing concerns along China’s periphery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is a core member of the China-headquartered Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which comprises eight Member States (China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan), as well as four Observer States and six Dialogue Partners. The SCO has provided a platform for China and Russia to coordinate their interests and manage competition in Central Asia and connected regions. The two countries have also used the SCO as a platform to cooperate on anti-terrorism and countering separatist activities, including through multilateral military exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PvbR5Op.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia both seek security and stability in Central Asia and are wary of what they perceive to be potential western “interference.” Chinese officials have voiced support for cooperating with Russia to fight against potential “color revolutions” in neighboring countries, which Beijing worries could lead to instability spilling over into its western regions of Xinjiang and Tibet. From Beijing’s perspective, Russia plays a crucial role in shaping regional security dynamics thanks to its close relationships with former Soviet states in the region. Russia demonstrated its ability to shape the region in January 2022 when it deployed troops to Kazakhstan to quell violent protests that erupted over high energy prices. China and Russia also both see shared interests in working with the Taliban in Afghanistan to reduce the risk of terrorist activity there and throughout the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the region, Beijing has pursued cooperation with Moscow in managing the North Korean nuclear issue. Both countries have pushed back against calls by the United States and its partners to impose additional sanctions on North Korea, and they have recommended lifting certain sanctions. At the same time, Beijing is aware of Pyongyang’s desire to maneuver between its two large neighbors, as it has at times sought to pit Beijing against Moscow. To sustain any major policies toward North Korea, China needs Russian support or to at least ensure that Moscow does not play a spoiler role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is not unique in being willing to accept or support China’s core interests. Many countries are willing to do so. A key factor that differentiates Russia is high-level political support from Beijing, which stems from the close personal relationship between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Their personal ties help to drive high-level strategic convergence and overcome any distrust or differences at lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi has repeatedly heaped praise on Putin, calling him his “best friend and colleague” and his “bosom buddy.” This has been reflected in Xi’s diplomatic agenda. As of May 2022, Xi had met one-on-one with Putin 39 times — more than twice as many times as he has met with the leader of any other country. Xi has also traveled to Russia eight times since 2013, which is more than double the number of trips he made to his second most frequented country (the United States).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Xi Jinping’s Meetings with Select Foreign Leaders (2013-2022)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personal ties between the two leaders have brought their countries closer across several key areas. Under Putin, Russia has supported virtually all of Xi Jinping’s most important priorities on the world stage. Russia has at least rhetorically supported the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Xi’s signature foreign policy aimed at expanding China’s global economic and political influence through heightened economic and physical connectivity. Russian and Chinese leaders have repeatedly voiced joint calls for linking up the BRI with its Russian counterpart, the Eurasian Economic Union; however, progress on synching the two initiatives has been lackluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia joined the Chinese-sponsored Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a multilateral bank headquartered in China that provides an alternative to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Russia has also supported China’s Global Development Initiative, which Xi proposed amid the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic to focus on issues such as poverty alleviation, food security, Covid-19 response, and other areas. Additionally, Xi Jinping likely saw Putin’s visit to China to attend the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics as a gesture of good will, especially given that most Western leaders chose not to attend or instituted diplomatic boycotts of the games due to concerns about human rights abuses in Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amplifying-chinas-global-reach&quot;&gt;Amplifying China’s Global Reach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third major force driving closer ties is a shared desire by Beijing and Moscow to expand their influence on the world stage at the expense of the United States and its democratic allies. While Russian power is stagnating in crucial areas, many in China see Moscow as being capable of “playing a weak hand well.” Beijing sees significant benefits in Russia’s capacity and willingness to wield its political, economic, military, and discourse power in ways that align with Chinese interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia are both wary of a U.S.-dominated international order that they believe undermines their interests. The two maintain convergent threat assessments that Washington, with support from its allies, seeks to encircle and isolate them militarily while undermining their political systems and promoting “color revolutions.” They view Western economic sanctions, technological decoupling, and other efforts as being aimed at undermining their development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two countries have frequently criticized the United States and its partners in their joint statements. Their February 4, 2022, joint statement — which highlighted their closeness on the eve of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — criticized the United States nine times, including complaints about the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy, the trilateral AUKUS security partnership, and U.S. developments related to missile deployments, missile defense, and biological and chemical weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pushing back against Western influence, Beijing benefits from Russia’s ability to shape international developments and leverage its power over countries — especially within the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the political front, Russia holds significant positions within international organizations such as the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), where it (like China) enjoys veto power as a permanent member. Through the UNSC, China and Russia have sought to steer international developments in their favor. China and Russia jointly condemned NATO’s use of force in Yugoslavia and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. In 2020, China and Russia spearheaded a successful campaign within the UNSC to stop U.S.-led efforts to re-impose UN sanctions on Iran in the wake of the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s 13 most recent vetoes within the UNSC have all aligned with Russian vetoes. Ten of these have been related to opposing U.S. and allied efforts to address the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Syria. China has also abstained from voting on UNSC resolutions that run counter to Russian interests, including a 2014 resolution declaring invalid a referendum that led to Crimea’s independence and a resolution condemning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/C6uEGxH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Chinese and Russian Vetoes in the UN Security Council&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing and Moscow have specifically sought to cooperate within international organizations to undermine Western norms around democracy and human rights. Since the late 1990s, China and Russia have been involved in the informal Like-Minded Group, a coalition of largely authoritarian countries that have worked together in the United Nations to weaken the international human rights regime and redefine human rights. The two countries have jointly signed over 40 statements in the UN Human Rights Council to endorse alternative views on human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the United Nations, China and Russia have worked together in other important multilateral settings to offset Western influence. In 2009, Russia advocated that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expand the basket of Special Drawing Rights to include the Russian ruble and Chinese yuan as part of reforming the IMF to be more inclusive. The two countries have also advocated for their shared interests within BRICS Summits — annual meetings of the world’s leading developing economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) — and they continue to call for further cooperation within the BRICS framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the economic front, Russia wields significant leverage over several countries through its provision of energy resources. In 2020, 10 European and Central Asian countries purchased more than 60 percent of their crude oil imports from Russia, with Estonia, Kyrgyzstan, Slovakia, and Kazakhstan buying virtually all of their imported crude oil from Russia. These countries, and others, are also heavily reliant on imports of Russian refined oil, gas, and coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has a track record of using its prominence in energy markets to its advantage. In 2014, Russian energy giant Gazprom cut off gas deliveries to Slovakia, Austria, Poland, and Romania to disrupt diversions of oil to Ukraine. The European Union scrambled to find alternative sources of energy, but it was forced to pay a higher price in doing so. Many of these same dynamics played out in Europe amid Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Russia’s Nord Stream pipeline being a major source of contention. For Beijing, Russia’s ability to use such influence is an important asset for constraining and countering countries on key issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Cf1HKfu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow also exerts significant influence in much of the developing world through its military power, especially its weapons sales. Particularly important for Beijing is Russia’s influence over Vietnam and India, both of which have tense relations with China. Since 2010, Vietnam has received some 80 percent of its weapons imports from Russia. India likewise ordered 62 percent of its arms imports from Russia during that period, and today nearly 70 percent of India’s military equipment is Russian-made. Moscow may be able to use its leverage over these two countries to discourage them from aligning closer to the West (and against Russian and Chinese interests).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s international influence in the military realm does not just stem from arms sales. Moscow holds sway in developing countries through military deployments. Over the last few decades, Russia has amassed a substantial military footprint around the world, including within the Caucuses and Syria, but also further afield in the Central African Republic, Egypt, Libya, Sudan, and even Venezuela. More recently, Russia has sought to expand its influence in the African country of Mali through the deployment of Russian private military contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Reliance on Russian Arms Imports (2010-2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China sees benefits in Russia’s ability and willingness to shape global discourse through disinformation and propaganda that converges with China’s own anti-Western messaging. The Russian government has long used online tools to spread pro-Russian, anti-Western narratives. The government-funded organization Russia Today, for example, regularly spreads divisive, anti-Western disinformation to its nearly 7.5 million Facebook followers and 3 million Twitter followers from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia and China have used their state-linked online platforms in complementary efforts to shape global discourse and spread disinformation. Russia, has focused intently on undermining confidence in Western vaccines and flaming internal divisions within Western countries over issues like vaccine mandates. Early on in the pandemic, China marshalled its diplomats and state-linked media to spread propaganda defending China’s response to the pandemic, but over time it focused more heavily on criticizing the West’s handling of Covid-19. Studies suggest the two countries learned from each other in spreading disinformation and that they benefited from shared efforts to undercut the image of the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advancing-chinas-military-power&quot;&gt;Advancing China’s Military Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military cooperation has been a crucial element of the China-Russia relationship over the years. The two sides have demonstrated a high level of cooperation on military technology — most notably through arms sales — as well as military-to-military cooperation through joint exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 1989 normalization of relations between Beijing and Moscow, Soviet and Russian arms sales to China were critical to China’s push to modernize and equip the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) as Western countries limited their provision of weapons to China. In the 1990s, China spent billions of dollars ordering dozens of Russian Su-27 and Su-30 aircraft and securing the licenses to produce hundreds more of the planes within China. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, China ordered other major systems from Russia, including a dozen Kilo-class diesel-powered submarines, four Sovremenny-class destroyers, and S300 PMU2 anti-aircraft missiles, as well as numerous additional aircraft. Altogether, between 1990 and 2005, China purchased more than 83 percent of its arms imports from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The years that followed saw a marked decline in Chinese arms purchases — from both Russia and other countries. This stemmed in part from Russian concerns about Chinese copying and IP theft of Russian military technologies as well as the Chinese defense industry’s growing ability to produce more equipment indigenously. China’s arms purchases from 2011 to 2021 fell 46 percent from the 2000-2010 period, and purchases from Russia as a percent of China’s total arms imports slipped to around 67 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/H7c45sQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Arms Imports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, China and Russia made efforts to arrest this trend and revive arms sales as an important part of the relationship. A series of deals in 2015 saw China purchase some $5 billion worth of Su-35 combat aircraft and S-400 air defense systems. In 2019, President Putin also announced that Russia was helping China to create a missile attack warning system, suggesting a continued high degree of military technological cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to arms sales, China and Russia have achieved substantial progress on cooperation through joint military exercises. The two countries conducted their first bilateral joint exercise in 2005. Known as “Peace Mission 2005,” the exercise saw 10,000 Chinese and Russian troops take part in land, sea, and air operations in Vladivostok in Russia and on the Shandong peninsula in China. Like many joint China-Russia military exercises that have followed, it was described as being largely aimed at counterterrorism operations; however, the inclusion of major military assets like strategic bombers was seen by many as an indication that it was broader in scope and also intended as a warning to the United States and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next several years saw the two countries participate in a handful of joint exercises, averaging approximately one to two exercises per year. Starting in 2013, however, China and Russia significantly ramped up their bilateral and multilateral exercises with each other. Through mid-2022, they have held at least 78 military (and paramilitary) exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These military exercises have not only grown in number but also in complexity. In October 2021, China and Russia completed joint naval drills in the Sea of Japan, followed immediately by their first joint naval patrol in the western Pacific. The joint naval patrol consisted of 10 Chinese and Russian warships as well as six carrier-based helicopters and featured joint maneuvers and live-fire drills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These frequent exercises present several benefits for China. Earlier on, they provided an opportunity for the PLA to learn from the more experienced and technologically advanced Russian military. In more recent exercises, Chinese defense experts have noted that the PLA now plays an equal or more senior role in planning and operations. The exercises also serve as an important means of institutionalizing bilateral military ties, promoting interoperability and confidence building, and sending deterrent signals to third parties such as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-and-resource-complementarity&quot;&gt;Economic and Resource Complementarity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China’s ties with Russia generate notable benefits on the economic front. The last two decades have witnessed enormous growth in trade between the two countries. Between 2000 and 2021, China’s annual trade with Russia grew more than 18-fold, from just $8 billion to more than $147 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this only represents about 2 percent of China’s total trade with the world, it is the content of the trade relationship — not the size — that is crucial to China. Major energy products, such as oil, coal, and gas, comprise approximately two-thirds of China’s imports from Russia. Crude oil alone accounts for over half of China’s imports from Russia. In 2021, China imported some $40.5 billion worth of Russian crude oil — roughly 16 percent of its total oil imports — making Russia its second largest oil supplier after Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Composition of Chinese Imports from Russia (2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian trade with China also has a disproportionate impact on certain local economies within China. Trade with Russia is particularly important among northeastern provinces that border Russia. According to Chinese customs data, 24 percent of exports out of China’s Heilongjiang Province went to Russia in 2021, and a massive 78 percent of the province’s imports came from Russia. Jilin and Inner Mongolia — both of which border Russia — are likewise more dependent on Russian trade than other provinces (though to a lesser extent than Heilongjiang).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Reliance on Exports to Russia by Province&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Beijing’s perspective, Russia plays a crucial role in promoting economic growth in a lagging region. Both Jilin and Heilongjiang form part of China’s northeastern “rust belt,” an area of the country that has struggled to overcome the impacts of de-industrialization. China has sought to maximize the benefits of Russian trade to the region by forming pilot free trade zones in Heilongjiang and enabling Jilin export access to a Russian port. Additionally, two land ports within Hunchun, a city in Jilin, were approved as official seafood import ports from Russia, allowing Russian seafood exports to directly reach Hunchun, lowering costs and improving quality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>CSIS China Power Team</name></author><summary type="html">China largely eschewed formal alliances, but has increasingly courted close ties with Russia.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/ngvKW1R.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/ngvKW1R.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
