Stricter privacy protections are necessary to strengthen U.S. national security, human rights, and economic interests.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, when whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that U.S. government agencies had intercepted bulk telephone and internet communications from numerous individuals around the world, President Barack Obama acknowledged a long-standing yet unsettled dilemma: “You can’t have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. . . . There are trade-offs involved.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snowden’s disclosures reignited robust debates over the appropriate balance between an individual’s right to privacy and the state’s interest in protecting economic and national security — in particular, where to place limitations on the U.S. government’s ability to compel access to signals intelligence held by private companies. These debates continue today, but the internet landscape — and subsequently, the relationship between the U.S. government and private sector — has evolved substantially since 2013. U.S. government agencies still routinely mandate private companies like Verizon and Google hand over customers’ personal information and issue nondisclosure orders to prevent these companies from informing individuals about such access. But the volume and technical complexity of the data ecosystem have exploded over the past decade, spurred by the rising ubiquity of algorithmic profiling in the U.S. private sector. As a result, U.S. government agencies have increasingly turned to “voluntary” mechanisms to access data from private companies, such as purchasing smartphone geolocation history from third-party data brokers and deriving insights from publicly available social media posts, without the formal use of a warrant, subpoena, or court order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2023, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) declassified a report from January 2022 — one of the first public efforts to examine the “large amount” of commercially available information that federal national security agencies purchase. In this report, ODNI recognizes that sensitive personal information both “clearly provides intelligence value” but also increases the risk of harmful outcomes like blackmail or harassment. Despite the potential for abuse, the declassified report reveals that some intelligence community elements have not established proper privacy and civil liberties guardrails for commercially acquired information and that even ODNI lacks awareness of the full scope of data brokerage contracts across its 18 units. Critically, the report recognizes that modern advancements in data collection have outpaced existing legal safeguards: “Today’s CAI [commercially available information] is more revealing, available on more people (in bulk), less possible to avoid, and less well understood than traditional PAI [publicly available information].”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ODNI report demonstrates how the traditional view of the privacy-security trade-off is becoming increasingly nuanced, especially as gaps in outdated federal law around data collection and transfers expand the number of actors and risk vectors involved. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan recently noted that there are also geopolitical implications to consider: “Our strategic competitors see big data as a strategic asset.” When Congress banned the popular mobile app TikTok on government devices in the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), it cited fears that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could use the video-hosting app to spy on Americans. However, the NDAA did not address how numerous other smartphone apps, beyond TikTok, share personal information with data brokers — which, in turn, could transfer it to adversarial entities. In 2013, over 250,000 website privacy policies acknowledged sharing data with other companies; since then, this number inevitably has increased. In a digitized society, unchecked data collection has become a vulnerability for U.S. national security — not merely, as some once viewed, a strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reinvigorated focus on TikTok’s data collection practices creates a certain paradox. While politicians have expressed concerns about Chinese government surveillance through mobile apps, U.S. government agencies have purchased access to smartphone geolocation data and social media images related to millions of Americans from data brokers without a warrant. The U.S. government has simultaneously treated TikTok as a national security risk and a handy source of information, reportedly issuing the app over 1,500 legal requests for data in 2021 alone. It is also important to note that national security is not the only value that can come into tension with information privacy, as unfettered data collection carries broader implications for civil rights, algorithmic fairness, free expression, and international commerce, affecting individuals both within and outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The ODNI report demonstrates how the traditional view of the privacy-security trade-off is becoming increasingly nuanced, especially as gaps in federal law around data collection and transfers expand the number of actors and risk vectors involved.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological advancements warrant a reexamination of the traditional privacy-security trade-off — one that prioritizes forward-looking guardrails around emerging trends in data analytics, particularly the rising ubiquity of commercially available information. This report attempts to bridge these gaps by analyzing the relationship between the U.S. data brokerage industry and domestic and foreign government agencies. It first explains how private companies have built up massive troves of personal information, which data brokers aggregate and sell to both public and private sector entities without proper safeguards to protect privacy and civil liberties. Then it analyzes U.S. privacy developments alongside those in the European Union, Canada, and China, illustrating how even governments that have recently modernized their data protection frameworks still have not fully addressed voluntary access to private sector data. Ultimately, it illustrates how stricter U.S. data privacy regulations in the private and public sectors will strengthen the national security, human rights, and economic interests of the United States rather than hobble its geopolitical competitive position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Data Brokers Operate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, popular consumer-facing devices, websites, and apps have built up increasingly sophisticated surveillance capabilities due to several trends. For one, data storage has become more affordable, creating incentives for companies to retain data even when it is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was originally collected. In addition, widespread deployment of predictive algorithms across all sectors has generated high demand for personal information. As a result, numerous digital platforms now operate their business models around sharing detailed user information with advertisers, private corporations, individuals, or government agencies — often through third-party intermediaries known as data brokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data brokers operate in many forms, but they generally profit from aggregating, packaging, and transferring the personal information of large numbers of individuals. Many of these companies compile nonpublic information such as smartphone geolocation, internet history, communication metadata, utilities, and biometrics, which they obtain from sources like mobile apps and web browsers using software development kits, cookies, real-time bidding processes, and direct purchases. Some also scrape publicly available information like social media posts, audio and visual footage taken in outdoor areas, or government archives like Department of Motor Vehicles records, voter registrations, tax or property filings, or arrest histories. Data brokers may also obtain information from other data brokers or even purchase mobile apps in order to acquire datasets, creating an intricate, nontransparent web that affected individuals and the general public cannot follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Sensor Tower, the average American interacts with almost 50 mobile apps per device per month, many of which track intimate details such as a person’s location history, communications records, purchases, web or browsing activity, and biometrics. When data brokers combine such information from multiple first-party sources, they can paint an extensive picture of a person’s lifestyle habits and preferences. A 6(b) study by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2014 found that Acxiom had over 3,000 data points for almost all U.S. individuals, and since then the information ecosystem has only grown. The same 6(b) study also found that some of the nine large data brokers surveyed “store all data indefinitely, even if it is later updated, unless otherwise prohibited by contract.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Widespread deployment of predictive algorithms across all sectors has generated high demand for personal information.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no single legal definition of a data broker in the United States, which presents a challenge to regulating their interactions with government agencies. In 2014, the FTC described data brokers as “companies that collect consumers’ personal information and resell or share that information with others.” This definition broadly encompasses both first- and third-party companies, as well as those that transfer data without a monetary transaction. California requires any business that “knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business [it] does not have a direct relationship” to register with the state attorney general. As of November 2022, 515 companies had done so. The American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA) generally defines third-party collecting entities as those “whose principal source of revenue is derived from processing or transferring the covered data that the covered entity did not collect directly from the individuals.” This report primarily analyzes third-party data brokers who lack direct relationships with individuals linked to datasets and fall within the ADPPA’s definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some data brokers sell datasets in aggregate form, deidentification does not guarantee individuals’ privacy or safety. It is possible to reidentify specific individuals by combining multiple attributes or tracking location data points over an extended period. In 2013, Harvard University professor Latanya Sweeney reidentified over 40 percent of 1,000 “anonymous” individuals who shared DNA for the Personal Genome Project by combining their information with public records like voter registration. Tufts University professor Susan Landau recently testified that often only four data points are required to reidentify specific individuals. In a 2022 letter, a trio of senators expressed concerns that BetterHelp and Talkspace had shared sensitive mental health information that could readily reidentify individuals: “Even though you claim this data is anonymized, it can still provide third parties with important and identifying information.” One broker, Fog Data Science, claims it does not collect names or email addresses but sells the long-term geolocation history of smartphone devices, which can infer where somebody lives or sleeps based on their movement patterns. Furthermore, even aggregated location patterns can help law enforcement officers locate abortion facilities with high levels of activity or detect routes along the U.S.-Mexico border with unusual traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data brokers may also build and license algorithmic models to infer or predict information from otherwise unconnected data points, such as health, finances, race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, familial status, and more. Without federal regulations, Americans have little control over how data brokers handle their personal information, particularly since first-party businesses typically do not disclose the identities of the third parties with whom they share such information or how algorithmic inferences can inform decisions that could significantly affect people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;examples-of-us-data-brokers&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Examples of U.S. data brokers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LexisNexis has reportedly compiled over 78 billion data points from 10,000 public and private sources in 442 lifestyle categories that predict individual health risks and subsequent medical costs. While the company stated in 2018 that its analysis had not yet influenced individual insurance costs, there is no guarantee this will not happen in the future.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As of 2014, an Equifax subsidiary had reportedly aggregated and sold access to employee pay stub information for approximately 38 percent of the U.S. workforce.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Datalogix compiles and sells personal shopping history from over 1,400 store loyalty programs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LexisNexis had reportedly scraped over 37 billion data points from 10,000 different government sources as of 2021, including criminal and property records. Meanwhile, Spokeo, Intelius, and BeenVerified, also known as people search websites, sell access to personal information scraped from public records to anybody on the internet, typically for a low fee.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SafeGraph, Venntel, X-Mode, and Babel Street purchase geolocation and other personal information from smartphone apps, advertising exchanges, and other data brokers, which they then sell to other companies, individuals, or government agencies. In recent years, U.S. agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) have purchased U.S. smartphone geolocation information from data brokers without a warrant.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Clearview AI has reportedly scraped billions of images from publicly available websites, including social media platforms. Using facial recognition technologies, it matches specific individuals to uploaded photos. It licenses access to this extensive database to over 3,000 federal and state entities, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and FBI.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Giant Oak, Palantir, and Barbaricum monitor social media platforms in aggregate, allowing customers to search billions of user-generated posts for keywords or images. The DHS has reportedly contracted private vendors to track open-source social media posts to identify individuals within the United States that could be associated with visa overstays, public safety risks, or national security threats. Starting in March 2020, Barbaricum, in partnership with Palantir, received a $2.1–$5.5 million contract to track real-time social media activity, which could include content that users later delete, from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Vigilant Solutions and Thomson Reuters have monitored and stored the image, location, and time stamp history of billions of license plates in open-air parking lots, highways, and intersections, effectively providing a warrantless means of tracking individuals’ locations for thousands of U.S. law enforcement agencies. Between 2017 and 2021, the DHS awarded $7.4 million to West Publishing Corporation, owned by Thomson Reuters, to access its license plate recognition database.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Fog Data Science has advertised collecting billions of data signals from mobile apps, revealing “near real-time” location histories from over 250 million U.S. devices dating back to 2017. It has sold access to this information to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies for under $10,000 annually, sometimes offering free trials.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;privacy-concerns-from-domestic-government-relationships-with-us-data-brokers&quot;&gt;Privacy Concerns from Domestic Government Relationships with U.S. Data Brokers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By design, third-party data brokers pose risks to a person’s privacy. Among other practices, the industry infers intimate details about a person’s life from a myriad of data points, processes personal information for secondary purposes outside the scope of the initial interaction, and multiplies the number of parties that access a dataset throughout its life cycle. For instance, ProPublica reports that data brokers have helped health insurers predict physical and mental health conditions by analyzing disparate data points such as education, age, race, marital status, neighborhood, and recent purchases. In addition, Duke University researcher Joanne Kim found that several U.S. data brokers may have access to contact information that can identify individual users of mobile mental health apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, privacy violations by the U.S. data brokerage industry can cause both measurable and immeasurable consequences for Americans, including psychological, emotional, reputational, financial, and physical harm. For example, data brokers have targeted predatory advertisements related to debt or financial scams to individuals whom they have algorithmically profiled as financially vulnerable. In 2016, LeapLab settled with the FTC after selling payday loan applications to marketers who then stole money from bank accounts. Data brokers can also reveal details such as sexual orientation without individuals’ consent, placing LGBTQ+ individuals at disproportionate risk of doxing or discrimination. In 2021, a senior official of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops resigned after being involuntarily outed by a religious publication that had purchased his Grindr location information from a data broker. Data brokers can even enable stalking or physical violence. In 2020, a gunman shot a federal judge’s husband and son after purchasing her home address and other personal information online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When third-party data brokers share personal attributes with U.S. government agencies, they may influence significant societal decisions, such as imprisonment, deportation, distribution of public benefits, and more. Since 2014, ICE has regularly contracted Palantir to mine personal information from public and private databases, reportedly facilitating deportations, workplace raids, and family separation. In 2019, ICE — aided by Palantir systems — arrested 680 workers at a food processing company in Mississippi, leaving at least two children at home unaccompanied for over a week after their parents were detained. In 2021, LexisNexis received a contract worth up to $1.2 billion to verify individuals’ identities for state unemployment insurance claims, a critical lifeline for many Americans. The same year, researchers at the Center for Democracy and Technology uncovered an additional 30 U.S. federal government awards for data brokerage services that totaled approximately $86 million, likely a fraction of the full scope of government contracts that data brokers received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As U.S. government agencies become increasingly dependent on the private sector, some analysts point out that data brokers can offer material benefits. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Department of Labor, Internal Revenue Service, and Department of Veterans Affairs have used aggregated data points to predict fraudulent or erroneous payments. However, the same datasets used for beneficial purposes can also lead to secondary, more controversial outcomes. For example, Thomson Reuters offers a CLEAR database that contains home addresses, vehicle registrations, employment histories, and utility records from at least 400 million individuals. Although the company markets this database to provide alternative credit histories for people who lack access to traditional credit cards, ICE also reportedly used this service until 2021 to help enforce deportations of individuals who do not pose physical security threats. In fact, data brokers can serve a variety of functions for both public and private organizations, potentially informing decisions related to employment, credit or risk scores, health insurance, public interest research, political outreach, and policing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the purpose behind the surveillance effort, there is at least some ethical ambiguity with any contract that U.S. government agencies sign with data brokers. First of all, U.S. government contracts feed into the rapid growth of an industry that faces minimal legal limitations on collecting, processing, storing, and sharing data. Second, algorithms based on personal attributes sometimes draw inaccurate conclusions that can significantly affect people’s lives. Between 2008 and 2019, ICE relied on faulty databases, compiled with the assistance of private data brokers, to arrest approximately two million individuals based on their country of birth and lack of verified citizenship documents — a practice a federal judge found unconstitutional in Gonzalez v. ICE (2019). Due to overreliance on flawed electronic databases, law enforcement officers have mistakenly targeted individuals such as Renata and Chris Simmons, whose dog police officers shot, and Denise Green, whom officers wrongly held at gunpoint. In many cases, individuals do not have the option to view these databases or request that data brokers correct inaccurate profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;U.S. government contracts feed into the rapid growth of an industry that faces minimal legal limitations on collecting, processing, storing, and sharing data.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When data brokers collaborate with law enforcement agencies to implement predictive policing, they could produce inaccurate or flawed outcomes based on historically biased training data. At the local level, some police departments have used modeling systems designed by firms like PredPol to anticipate crime based on historical patterns and adjust their patrol routes accordingly. In addition, data brokers have sold Americans’ personal information to state-run fusion centers, which hire analytics firms like Palantir to scan past data for future threats. But since local governments have historically focused surveillance resources on neighborhoods based on factors like race, income, and religion, predictive modeling systems draw upon and reproduce these biases in future cycles. At the federal level, the DHS’s use of social media analysis to predict threats is notoriously defective, since it frequently uses vague keywords as proxies for illegal activity and may fail to identify context clues, cultural differences in speech, and satire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data brokerage industry is shadowy and opaque, as companies rarely disclose details of their data collection and analysis to external parties. This lack of transparency prevents government agencies and other customers from discovering potential biases in these technologies, even when they lead to erroneous criminal arrests. Trade secret protections further complicate access to exculpatory evidence that could prove an individual’s innocence if inaccurate datasets or algorithms are used. Although data brokers may post vague privacy policies on their websites, they generally do not disclose the specific entities they access information from, clients they share information with, methods of building algorithmic inferences, and types of data that are stored or shared. In other words, there are few ways for impacted individuals, public interest researchers, or the general public to learn about the sale of personal information or to correct any subsequent predictive profiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Since local governments have historically focused surveillance resources on neighborhoods based on factors like race, income, and religion, predictive modeling systems draw upon and reproduce these biases in future cycles.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from accuracy concerns, data brokers can also perpetuate systemic biases in law enforcement by directly targeting personal attributes like race, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, and income. For example, X-Mode and Predicio have reportedly sold information from smartphone apps like Muslim Pro and Salaat First to Department of Defense (DOD) contractors. Kochava, which is facing an FTC lawsuit, sold location information that could be used to track people who visit places of worship, reproductive health facilities, addiction recovery centers, and homeless shelters. In mid-2020, Mobilewalla reportedly monitored the device geolocation history of approximately 17,000 individuals at Black Lives Matter demonstrations, and the Los Angeles Police Department tested ABTShield to scan Twitter for keywords like “lives matter,” “protest,” and “solidarity.” In 2018, the DOJ initiated an investigation into the Oregon TITAN Fusion Center for tracking local residents who had posted #BlackLivesMatter on social media platforms. Furthermore, Venntel has sold smartphone geolocation data to ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to track individuals along the U.S.-Mexico border, which increases the vulnerability of immigrants and noncitizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;national-security-concerns-about-foreign-government-access-to-the-us-data-brokerage-ecosystem&quot;&gt;National Security Concerns about Foreign Government Access to the U.S. Data Brokerage Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, most private companies, including data brokers, face few constraints on transferring or storing personal information outside the country. As a result, foreign governments can easily obtain sensitive personal information about Americans through data brokers, whether through direct transactions or third-party intermediaries like front companies. However, due to a general lack of transparency, it is difficult to measure the degree to which U.S. data brokers currently work with foreign governments, including China or Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, William Evanina, then director of the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center, stated that China is “one of the leading collectors of bulk personal data around the globe, using both illegal and legal means.” Between 2020 and 2021, the Washington Post documented over 300 relationships between China and Chinese-based private data miners to cross-analyze social media posts, public records, and commercial datasets. These included detailed profiles of domestic and foreign journalists and critics, some of whom were located in the United States, that were accessible to China’s Propaganda Department, state media, law enforcement, and military. In 2018, China’s state-controlled People’s Daily reported the government’s public opinion data mining industry was worth tens of billions of yuan and rapidly expanding by 50 percent each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although foreign governments, like China, do not have legal jurisdiction over most Americans, they could still benefit from the ubiquitous digital surveillance U.S. data brokers offer. For example, foreign entities could purchase sensitive geolocation information to target specific high-profile individuals like politicians or journalists. Demonstrating the ease of smartphone tracking, the New York Times obtained over 50 billion anonymized smartphone geolocation points from 2016 to 2017 and almost instantaneously identified former U.S. president Donald Trump, Secret Service agents, senior congressional staffers, and DOD officials. In addition to geolocation, commercial data sales related to physical or mental health, personal relationships, or finances could increase the vulnerability of high-profile Americans to blackmail or doxing by foreign and domestic bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign governments gaining direct access to Americans’ personal information or algorithmic inferences through U.S. data brokers could compromise military or intelligence operations. In 2016, PlanetRisk inadvertently detected U.S. military operations in Syria by tracking soldiers’ smartphone geolocation data. In December 2017, Strava unveiled a publicly available heat map that displayed over 1.4 trillion latitude and longitude points of individuals wearing fitness trackers, possibly implicating those in military bases in Afghanistan, Syria, Niger, Djibouti, Yemen, and Turkey. As recently as 2021, Acxiom, LexisNexis, and Nielsen actively advertised selling or sharing information related to military officers. Even China cautioned its People’s Liberation Army personnel in 2015 about the data protection risks of “device[s] that can record high-definition audio and video, take photos, and process and transmit data” — in other words, most popular consumer products today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced data analysis could also help foreign actors strategically promote authoritarian or otherwise harmful messaging during U.S. elections based on voters’ interests and backgrounds. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Russia-linked Internet Research Agency (IRA) purchased about 3,000 political advertisements and uploaded 80,000 posts on Facebook using stolen U.S. identities, reaching tens of millions of U.S. users. The IRA disproportionately targeted Black voters with both paid advertisements and unpaid content to discourage turnout; many of its user-generated posts mentioned race in some form. A subsequent investigation by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, led by Robert Mueller, found the threat posed by ad targeting “is magnified by the ease with which personal data can be purchased or stolen by a foreign adversary with advanced cyber capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven years after the 2016 election cycle, commercial data brokers routinely sell Americans’ personal information to U.S. political campaigns, leaving the infrastructure in place for foreign governments to potentially influence domestic elections using the same tools. Both Democratic and Republican campaigns use U.S. data brokers like Experian to purchase datasets on income, religion, gun ownership, credit score, and voter registration in order to direct relevant online advertisements, paper pamphlets, and phone calls to voters. The Republican National Committee reportedly possesses over 3,000 data points per U.S. voting adult. These tactics resemble those used by the controversial UK-based firm Cambridge Analytica, which amassed personal information from over 50 million Facebook users to target advertisements and fundraising requests for Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The widespread availability of these datasets, combined with common data brokerage practices of categorizing individuals based on inferred background or interests, could facilitate foreign government targeting of disinformation in future democratic elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast quantity and scope of information that data brokers store also enlarge the attack surface for state-sponsored cyber breaches, especially since not all companies employ adequate security protections. After the Chinese government hacked Equifax in 2017, exposing sensitive information of approximately 147 million Americans, the FTC discovered Equifax had failed to implement basic security measures such as encryption and strong passwords. In 2019, hackers offered up LimeLeads’ non-password-protected database for sale online, exposing names, email addresses, and home addresses from 49 million customers. Other major data broker breaches include Acxiom in 2003, Epsilon in 2011, and Experian in 2015, highlighting how U.S. personal information is of high interest to both domestic and foreign hackers. In 2005, a Senate hearing warned that massive aggregation and storage of sensitive personal details could create opportunities for identity theft. Since then, data collection has only escalated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Seven years after the 2016 election cycle, commercial data brokers routinely sell Americans’ personal information to U.S. political campaigns, leaving the infrastructure in place for foreign governments to potentially influence domestic elections using the same tools.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam Klein, director of the Robert Strauss Center on International Security and Law of the University of Texas at Austin, notes, “As long as this [the data broker] business model persists, it will remain virtually impossible to prevent this information — and the intelligence bounty that it represents — from falling into the hands of hostile foreign powers.” Although foreign governments may access information through many channels, the growing data brokerage industry both expands and expedites authoritarian surveillance and censorship efforts to a larger scale. This highlights the importance of modernizing privacy laws to curb extraneous data collection and mitigate risks to privacy, civil rights, and national security across the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-us-privacy-laws-fail-to-check-us-data-broker-partnerships-with-government-agencies&quot;&gt;Current U.S. Privacy Laws Fail to Check U.S. Data Broker Partnerships with Government Agencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-federal-and-state-commercial-privacy-landscape&quot;&gt;The U.S. Federal and State Commercial Privacy Landscape&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has dozens of federal and state statutes that address how private businesses protect personal information, but they have not undergone significant updates in decades and have fallen behind technological advancements. Many U.S. commercial data protection laws cover only specific sectors and types of companies, which leaves certain underregulated entities — data brokers, digital platforms, and mobile apps — free to process, share, and store an extensive range of sensitive personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 generally requires medical providers and health insurers to obtain affirmative express consent before sharing personal health information, but does not apply to data brokers, which can transfer mental or reproductive health data at will. Similarly, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 requires U.S. schools to follow certain privacy safeguards to protect their students, but does not prevent schools from using data brokers to target recruitment advertisements to individuals who are not enrolled. Most federal laws do not directly address geolocation tracking and sharing, except for the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 which requires companies to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from minors under 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only eight states — California, Utah, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Iowa, Indiana, and Tennessee — have enacted laws that allow residents the right to access, correct, and delete the personal information that private companies, including data brokers, hold. These states also require first-party companies that share information with third parties to impose contractual privacy obligations and mandate various degrees of data minimization. However, most U.S. states have not yet enacted comprehensive privacy laws, and the laws that exist have varying strength. For example, California allows people to opt out of automated profiling, while Utah does not. In addition, California and Vermont require data brokers to register with the state, providing some degree of transparency for individuals, regulators, and the public. Nevada, meanwhile, mandates data brokers to permit individuals to opt out of the sale or transfer of their personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Many U.S. commercial data protection laws cover only specific sectors and types of companies, which leaves certain underregulated entities — data brokers, digital platforms, and mobile apps — free to process, share, and store an extensive range of sensitive personal information.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FTC can act against companies, including data brokers, engaging in “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” across the U.S. economy, but there are limits to its enforcement power. Historically, it has focused primarily on companies that engage in deceptive behavior or misrepresent their privacy policies, leading to a system of “notice and consent,” in which companies require users to click “I accept” to data collection in order to access basic services. But an emphasis on notice and consent can incentivize companies to publish vague language that promises little-to-no privacy protections. As the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation observed in 2015: “If you do not want the FTC to come after you, do the bare-minimum on privacy.” As a result, many data brokers, such as Oracle and Epsilon, openly admit to aggregating data from thousands of companies in their privacy policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most agree the traditional notice-and-consent model does not effectively safeguard user privacy or restrict data brokerage practices. Even if individuals click “I consent” to use a first-party mobile app, they have no direct relationship with third-party data brokers and typically cannot control the future resale or use of their personal information. Additionally, nearly all digital platforms share personal information with third parties, leaving individuals with few options but to accept blanket data transfers if they want to engage in fundamental functions such as electronic communications, work, social or political activities, e-commerce, and rideshares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting these concerns, the FTC filed a complaint against Kochava in August 2022 to challenge its sale of the geolocation history of hundreds of millions of people, which could reveal visits to sensitive locations like reproductive health clinics or addiction recovery centers. Notably, the FTC argued Kochava’s practices are unfair, rather than deceptive, under Section 5 of the FTC Act — a departure from the traditional notice-and-consent approach. In August 2022, the FTC also issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) seeking public comment on topics that could directly affect data brokers, including business models “that are premised on or incentivize persistent tracking and surveillance.” However, a federal court dismissed the FTC’s complaint against Kochava in May 2023, writing that “the alleged privacy intrusion is not sufficiently severe to constitute substantial injury,” and the ANPR is not guaranteed success either. The FTC filed an amended complaint against Kochava the following month, but bipartisan FTC commissioners have also recognized the limits of existing enforcement authority and have called on Congress to pass legislation to directly regulate data privacy practices and strengthen agency resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;voluntary-and-compelled-disclosure-of-personal-information-by-us-government-agencies&quot;&gt;Voluntary and Compelled Disclosure of Personal Information by U.S. Government Agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with commercial privacy laws, Congress has enacted several pre-internet statutes that limit the U.S. government’s access to data held by private companies. But Congress has not passed major reforms in years, and the recent evolution of the data brokerage industry has offered government agencies a loophole to work around outdated and uneven rules on digital surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986 prevents certain types of businesses, such as phone companies and internet service providers, from voluntarily disclosing U.S. communications content and metadata to U.S. government agencies without a court order or subpoena. However, the ECPA does not apply to third-party data brokers or app developers, which largely did not exist back in 1986, leaving gaps where phone companies can sell “non-content” personal information to data brokers, who, in turn, can sell to government agencies outside the legal process. In 2018, Senator Ron Wyden called attention to Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Sprint’s sales of customer cell phone geolocation data to companies like LocationSmart, Zumigo, and Securus Technologies, which subsequently sold it to law enforcement agencies. In 2014, the Obama White House recommended modernizing the ECPA to remove “archaic distinctions” in privacy protections, but one decade later, the statute has not been substantially amended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a statutory framework that directly regulates data brokers’ sales, U.S. government agencies are still bound by constitutional constraints that provide minimum processes to protect individual privacy and civil liberties. However, technological advancements raise legal uncertainties about the application of data brokerage contracts to traditional legal jurisprudence, especially regarding Fourth Amendment requirements for government agencies to obtain probable cause warrants to conduct “unreasonable searches and seizures.” While the Supreme Court has historically defined “unreasonable searches and seizures” as violating a “reasonable expectation of privacy,” commercial digital surveillance has eroded societal expectations of privacy over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine what constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy, courts have traditionally distinguished between public and private places, generally holding that Americans possess a lesser expectation of privacy in at least some public settings. In line with this traditional viewpoint, Clearview AI reportedly does not require U.S. government agencies to obtain warrants to access its facial recognition database, which draws billions of images from publicly available sources. Similarly, U.S. law enforcement agencies have not obtained warrants before accessing Vigilant Solutions’s and Thomson Reuters’s vehicle location databases, which automatically scan license plates in public areas. Nor have government agencies sought warrants to scan billions of public social media posts and images for specific keywords or people, aided by analytics companies like Palantir and Giant Oak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Technological advancements raise legal uncertainties about the application of data brokerage contracts to traditional legal jurisprudence, especially regarding Fourth Amendment requirements for government agencies to obtain probable cause warrants to conduct “unreasonable searches and seizures.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. data brokerage industry also benefits from the third-party doctrine, or a legal notion that people do not possess a reasonable expectation of privacy from government agencies in information that they voluntarily share with third parties. In Carpenter v. United States (2018), the Supreme Court rejected the DOJ’s argument that the third-party doctrine should extend to cell site location information collected over a seven-day period, pointing out that smartphones are now a de facto requirement for modern society and that individuals cannot voluntarily choose to hand over unlimited geolocation data. However, the Carpenter decision was narrow, and it did not “call into question conventional surveillance techniques and tools, such as security cameras” nor “collection techniques involving foreign affairs or national security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Carpenter leaves a fair amount of gray area on the constitutionality of data brokerage partnerships with U.S. government agencies, these activities have nevertheless continued. In 2021, the DIA stated in a memo that it “does not construe the Carpenter decision to require a judicial warrant endorsing purchase or use of commercially-available data for intelligence purposes.” In 2020, Chad Mizelle, then acting general counsel at the DHS, arrived at a similar conclusion. The January 2022 ODNI report acknowledged that intelligence agencies have purchased the same types of cell phone geolocation records that Carpenter contested, stating that the sensitivity of such data may warrant additional safeguards. Some legal experts, like Carey Shenkman, Sharon Bradford Franklin, Greg Nojeim, and Dhanaraj Thakur of the Center for Democracy and Technology, argue that “the broad language of the [Carpenter] opinion suggests that the government must also obtain a warrant in order to access sensitive personal information in contexts beyond the facts of the case.” Yet others, such as Berkeley Law’s Orin Kerr, state that the Fourth Amendment does not require U.S. government agencies to have any justification or warrant to purchase information from a willing seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological advancements also create legal uncertainties around the constitutionality of geofence warrants. In United States v. Chatrie (2022), a Virginia federal court found a geofence warrant identifying all smartphones signed into Google within 150 meters of a bank robbery unconstitutional. The court ruled that law enforcement lacked probable cause to broadly track the geolocation history of every nearby individual during that time frame but, emphasizing the “novel” nature of geofencing technology, allowed the government to proceed with the evidence under the “good faith” exception in United States v. Leon. In United States v. Rhine (2023), the D.C. District Court upheld the constitutionality of a geofence warrant to track January 6 rioters at the U.S. Capitol but did not address whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his smartphone geolocation history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data brokers offer a path to work around these legal uncertainties, allowing law enforcement officers to sidestep geofence warrants by selling similar information (such as devices in specific locations at certain times) in ways that are much broader than a traditional warrant might allow. The judicial branch alone cannot resolve these legal issues. While courts interpret existing legal frameworks, they do not create new ones; rather they often either address overarching concepts like the Fourth Amendment or issue specific rulings like in Carpenter. Hence, Congress must act to both establish new privacy safeguards and amend existing statutes to account for emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-commercial-and-government-surveillance-ecosystem-in-the-european-union-and-china&quot;&gt;The Commercial and Government Surveillance Ecosystem in the European Union and China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advancements in data collection have exacerbated geopolitical tensions. It is difficult to preserve global trust if too many governments are escalating their own intelligence activities while also being averse to surveillance by other nations. Individuals and multinational companies, in turn, bear the immediate consequences of this lack of trust, especially if governments respond to extraterritorial access to personal information by cutting off cross-border exchanges of information and commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most large economies like the European Union, Canada, and China have enacted national laws that regulate how technology platforms collect, process, and share personal information. The United States, which does not have a comprehensive federal commercial privacy law, is an outlier. Despite this, all four governments have acted as customers as well as regulators of commercial data brokers, though the size of the industry in each country varies widely. In December 2022, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released nonbinding principles in the Declaration on Government Access to Personal Data Held by Private Sector Entities, in which 38 OECD countries pledged to follow democratic practices like transparency, accountability, and redress when compelling access to private sector data. The guidelines acknowledged, but did not specifically address, stakeholder calls for multilateral engagement on voluntary government access to commercial or publicly available personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is difficult to preserve global trust if too many governments are escalating their own intelligence activities while also being averse to surveillance by other nations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States can demonstrate willingness to implement major domestic restrictions on commercial data broker purchases, there is significant opportunity to illustrate shared values on privacy and promote global trust in cross-border data flows. As the data brokerage industry continues to operate globally, it is also important to understand how non-U.S. governments procure commercial datasets and explore ways to promote consistent and interoperable global frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;constraints-on-the-eu-data-brokerage-market-under-the-general-data-protection-regulation&quot;&gt;Constraints on the EU Data Brokerage Market under the General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data brokers face stricter legal constraints in the European Union than in the United States. The data brokerage market exists in the European Union, but on a smaller scale. The EU market is estimated to be around €100 billion ($116 billion) compared to a U.S. market of over $200 billion. Around 2018, Privacy International exercised its GDPR right to access data held by several major U.S.-based data brokers like Acxiom, Oracle, and Equifax, ultimately filing complaints to UK and EU data protection authorities over alleged violations of GDPR provisions on purpose limitations, consent, transparency, and more. The UK Information Commissioner’s Office subsequently audited several major data brokers, including Acxiom, Data Locator Group, GB Group, Experian, Equifax, and Callcredit. Around the same time, France’s Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) audited over 50 data brokers and ad-tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority fined Grindr €6.5 million ($7.1 million) for sharing personal information, including geolocation, age, gender, and sexual orientation, with third-party marketing entities between at least 2018 and 2020 without a valid consent mechanism. The same year, the Privacy Collective and others filed a class action lawsuit for €11 billion ($12 billion) against Oracle and Salesforce in the Netherlands, alleging that their use of ad-tech trackers and real-time bidding systems violated the GDPR. The Privacy Collective’s suit was dismissed for lack of standing, but future litigation is possible. In 2022, the French CNIL fined Clearview AI €20 million ($22 million) for scraping EU personal information in violation of the GDPR, following previous charges by data protection authorities in Italy, Greece, and the United Kingdom. In other words, the GDPR’s transparency and data minimization requirements expose EU data brokers to heavier compliance costs and higher possibilities of litigation, making the industry riskier and less profitable than in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2018, the GDPR has established legal responsibilities for most public and private sector entities, including data brokers, that process information “relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” The GDPR applies to some types of pseudonymized information, or information that “can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject,” and primarily excludes datasets where individuals cannot possibly be identified or reidentified in the future. In addition, GDPR protections cover public records and publicly available information. Overall, the GDPR regulates a much broader swath of personal information than what most recent U.S. legislative measures propose (see Section VII), which can constrain how EU data brokers initially collect and store commercial datasets, social media analysis, and public surveillance imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the GDPR does not directly apply to most law enforcement and intelligence operations, it still requires data brokers to have legal justification to sell personal information to government agencies — unlike the U.S. system, which places few hard restrictions on voluntary disclosure. Article 6 of the GDPR allows covered entities to process data to “protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person” and perform “task[s] carried out in the public interest.” Article 23 of the GDPR allows member states to pass legislation to restrict the GDPR for national security, defense, and other “important objectives of general public interest.” The GDPR’s purpose limitations prevent entities from collecting personal information for one reason, such as to provide a requested service, but then using it for secondary purposes, such as selling it to law enforcement through data brokers, without an additional legitimate reason. Nonetheless, the permitted categories are broad, so law enforcement agencies overall can still purchase commercial datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to purpose limitations, Article 5 of the GDPR requires data brokers to process personal information “fairly and in a transparent manner” and grants individuals the rights to access, correct, and delete data after they are processed. Article 14 requires data processors to disclose the names or categories of recipients of personal information, which could increase visibility into third-party data transfers. Furthermore, Article 22 allows individuals to opt out of automated profiling that could “significantly” affect them, which could limit some data brokerage activities but does not entirely prohibit behavioral advertising. Article 35 mandates entities perform “data protection impact assessment[s]” for processing activities “likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons,” which could affect development of tools by third-party data brokers for law enforcement or intelligence use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the GDPR has reduced the potential for privacy risks stemming from the EU data brokerage industry, it has not eliminated them entirely. For instance, OnAudience identified 1.4 million people who had searched for LGBTQ+ rights content ahead of the 2019 Polish parliamentary election, according to the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. While the data broker claimed its objective was to target voters with information about pro-equality campaigns, any data breaches or secondary uses of highly sensitive information like sexual orientation or gender identity could potentially result in involuntary outing or discrimination. The GDPR has also experienced challenges in enforcement timing and funding, both at the international and national levels. As of March 2022, Ireland’s Data Protection Authority had resolved only around 65 percent of cases involving cross-border data transfers since the GDPR became effective in 2018. In addition, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and national-level data protection authorities (DPAs) have faced procedural and communications challenges with regulatory enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Although the GDPR has reduced the potential for privacy risks stemming from the EU data brokerage industry, it has not eliminated them entirely.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;efforts-toward-member-state-harmonization-on-law-enforcement-and-privacy&quot;&gt;Efforts toward Member State Harmonization on Law Enforcement and Privacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the constraints the GDPR imposes on the data brokerage industry, some EU member states have continued to purchase commercial datasets and automated open-source intelligence from private vendors, raising privacy concerns. In 2022, the Dutch supervisory committee Commissie van Toezicht op de Inlichtingen en Veiligheidsdiensten (CTIVD) revealed the country’s intelligence agencies Algemene Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (AIVD) and Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD) had contracted private companies to analyze commercially available personal information and automatically scan open-source information. However, a general lack of transparency across EU intelligence and national security agencies means the full extent of their data broker partnerships is not publicly known, similar to the ongoing situation in the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article 4(2) of the Treaty Establishing the European Union (TEU) states that “national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State,” though EU law generally overrides any conflicts with national law. Some EU member states have enacted statutes that affect data brokerage relationships. For example, Articles 21 and 41 of the Dutch Intelligence and Security Services Act, or Wet op de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdiensten (WIV), require authorities to receive permission to engage in the systematic collection of publicly available information, including commercially available datasets. Nonetheless, since the European Union primarily leaves intelligence and law enforcement operations to individual nations, local rules around government transactions with commercial data brokers are fragmented and not always publicly clear. Still, attempts to standardize EU-wide safeguards for civil liberties and national security, such as the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFR), Convention 108, and the Law Enforcement Directive, carry implications for the regional data brokerage market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article 8 of the CFR affirms individuals’ rights to personal data protection in the European Union, stating that processing should take place only with a person’s consent or “some other legitimate basis laid down by law.” Furthermore, Article 8 of the ECHR prohibits government entities from interfering with a person’s “private and family life” except when “necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.” But it is not always possible to draw a clear line at “necessary” or “democratic” in the context of government transactions with commercial data brokers, especially when balancing civil liberties and national security interests. Although the CFR and ECHR — unlike the U.S. Constitution — explicitly recognize privacy as a fundamental human right, the application of traditional rights to new technological developments remains ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council of Europe, an international organization with 46 countries including 27 EU member states, amended its treaty on individual privacy and data processing in 2018. Article 11.3 of the Council of Europe’s amended Convention 108+ states that personal information may be processed for national security or defense activities only “by law and only to the extent that it constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society.” Article 6 states that more sensitive categories of data — genetic information, criminal history, race, and health information — may be processed only with appropriate legal safeguards. But Article 11 permits data processing for broad categories, including “the prevention of threats to national security and public safety,” which do not clearly define EU government restrictions on access to datasets voluntarily sold by third-party brokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is not always possible to draw a clear line at “necessary” or “democratic” in the context of government transactions with commercial data brokers, especially when balancing civil liberties and national security interests.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s Law Enforcement Directive (LED) also sets out requirements for authorities to process personal information in a “lawful, fair and transparent” manner that “constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society.” Article 8 of the LED allows data processing to occur only when necessary, based on existing law, and for a legitimate purpose. Article 11 prohibits the use of automated profiling for “adverse” legal decisions without robust safeguards. However, the LED generally does not apply to intelligence authorities and, as such, does not protect individuals from all types of commercial transactions with third-party data brokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has debated the acceptable parameters of facial recognition for law enforcement purposes, including in the context of commercial databases like Clearview AI. In April 2021, the European Commission presented a draft Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act that seeks to prohibit the use of real-time facial recognition in public spaces by law enforcement, except when strictly necessary to mitigate physical threats, prosecute criminal offenses, or locate missing victims. Due, in part, to concerns over the broad scope of these exceptions, the European Council approved an amended version in December 2022 that proposed to ban “remote biometric identification systems that are or may be used in publicly or privately accessible spaces, both offline and online.” This update expands the proposed prohibition from real-time surveillance to ex post identification, which would directly affect firms like Clearview AI that rely on ex post facial recognition. Once the AI Act is finalized and enacted, it will become one of the world’s first major AI regulations and could carry implications for data brokers that sell facial imagery in not only the European Union but the United States as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;schrems-ii-and-gdpr-data-adequacy-how-data-brokers-could-create-uncertainty-for-cross-border-data-flows&quot;&gt;Schrems II and GDPR Data Adequacy: How Data Brokers Could Create Uncertainty for Cross-Border Data Flows&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Schrems I and II, the CJEU invalidated the Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield data transfer agreements between the European Union and United States due to concerns that U.S. government surveillance practices did not meet the necessity and proportionality standards required by EU law. In particular, the CJEU cited the U.S. government’s ability to conduct bulk surveillance of EU individuals under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and Executive Order 12333. In response, the Biden administration released a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) in October 2022 that directly adopted the same necessity and proportionality language found in the CFR, Convention 108+, and LED. The EU-U.S. DPF also creates a new redress mechanism to allow individuals within designated countries to request review of suspected U.S. government signals intelligence collection by the ODNI, subject to the oversight of a new Data Protection Review Court within the DOJ. However, the EU-U.S. DPF remains susceptible to future court challenges, and the United States still lacks comparable commercial privacy laws and has not received an adequacy determination under the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, it will be interesting to see whether EU courts and data protection authorities will shift their focus to the growing data brokerage industry in the United States, especially as technological advancements in the private sector continue to enhance U.S. government surveillance. The European Union’s transactions with commercial data brokers pose a challenge to mitigating similar U.S. practices, as it is difficult to place geopolitical pressure on other countries to refrain from voluntary data access when the full scope of engagement on both sides is unknown. Fragmented intelligence statutes between EU member states can lead to less robust oversight of government purchases of personal information or algorithmic inferences, even if the GDPR reduces the availability of those commercial datasets overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has deemed Canada’s level of data protection, but not the United States’, as “essentially equivalent” to the European Union’s, allowing Canada-EU cross-border data transfers greater legal certainty under Article 45 of the GDPR. However, like the United States, Canada has accessed commercial or publicly available information from data brokers and is a member of the Five Eyes alliance. Canada’s Criminal Code generally requires domestic law enforcement agencies to receive authorization to access personal information, but their interactions with data brokers are not publicly clear. In a 2019 annual report, the Canadian National Security and Intelligence Review Agency found that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service used publicly available geolocation data without a warrant, even though it “lacked the policies or procedures” to ensure the legality of such access. The Security Intelligence Service and the Communications Security Establishment of Canada, the nation’s other major national security agency, both adhere to lighter due process requirements in their respective statutes compared to in the Criminal Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is difficult to place geopolitical pressure on other countries to refrain from voluntary data access when the full scope of engagement on both sides is unknown.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) governs how private companies process and share information, which limits but does not fully prevent commercial transactions with data brokers. After the PIPEDA became effective in 2004, at least one broker, R. L. Polk Canada Inc., announced it would no longer process personal information in Canada. Clearview AI also terminated its services with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in July 2020 after the Office of the Privacy Commissioner began investigating whether its use violated the PIPEDA and Privacy Act. However, the PIPEDA does not cover de-identified information and still allows firms like Cornerstone, Acxiom, Oracle Canada, Conway, Epsilon Data Management, and InfoCanada to engage in direct marketing or commercial data sharing. Section 7(3) of PIPEDA even allows private entities to voluntarily share personal information with law enforcement agencies without notifying or obtaining consent from the affected person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the EU’s Schrems I and II and GDPR adequacy decisions have not focused on the relationship between data brokers and government agencies, multilateral dialogues or consensus on safeguards and privacy principles could help improve trust between partner nations like the United States and Canada. All three governments have laid down some guardrails for compelled disclosure of data, but voluntary access to commercial or public information generally has not received the same level of attention or legal protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-data-protection-and-data-localization-landscape&quot;&gt;China’s Data Protection and Data Localization Landscape&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s surveillance apparatus relies heavily on private companies that collect and process personal information from both Chinese and non-Chinese individuals. Several statutes codify this relationship, giving China extensive control over the information companies store under its jurisdiction. In response to concerns over China’s data localization and national security laws, the United States, European Union, Canada, and other nations have blocked TikTok on government-issued devices. In May 2023, Montana became to first state to issue a blanket ban on all TikTok operations and app downloads within state borders, which, pending legal challenges, will come into effect in January 2024. Because TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, is based in China, legislators fear the CCP could access information about U.S. individuals that mobile apps, specifically TikTok, transfer or store within Chinese borders. There is no clear public evidence of direct CCP access through TikTok to date, but legislators have generally cited China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law, which requires individuals and organizations to “support, assist, and cooperate with state intelligence work according to law,” as a primary risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the National Intelligence Law, China’s Cybersecurity Law requires internet platforms that operate within its national borders to assist law enforcement in identifying content “endangering national security, national honor, and national interests.” These categories are fairly expansive. The Cybersecurity Law also imposes explicit data localization requirements, forcing companies to store “personal information or important data” collected in China on domestic servers. Some U.S. technology platforms ceased operations in China after the statute became effective in 2017, but others changed their policies to store data and decryption keys on local state-owned servers. The updated Multi-Level Protection Scheme (MLPS 2.0) also allows the government to monitor domestic private networks for national security threats, facilitating access to all data stored on servers or transmitted on networks within China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enacted in June 2021, the Data Security Law (DSL) further strengthens government access to user data, allowing law enforcement to compel private businesses that operate within China to disclose personal information. The DSL broadly defines key terms such as “core data” and “important data,” which gives authorities oversight over a range of user data like geolocation, browsing activity, financial records, and communications. For example, “core data,” which receives the greatest protections, refers to information that relates to significant public interests, national or economic security, or citizens’ welfare. Data localization laws present privacy concerns for individuals located within the United States that communicate with those in China, as government agencies could potentially read cross-border electronic communications stored in local data centers. This legal framework, in parallel with the burgeoning U.S. and Chinese data brokerage industries, gives the Chinese government significant resources to surveil individuals both within and outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond legal authority to compel disclosure of personal information, the CCP has additionally shifted to contracting private companies that voluntarily sell datasets or analytics software to surveil citizens. China’s Ministry of Public Security has reportedly allocated billions of dollars to private sector surveillance technologies under the SkyNet and Sharp Eyes plans. Among these are AI start-ups SenseTime and CloudWalk, which developed facial recognition systems that could identify members of the Uyghur community. According to procurement documents, Wuhan law enforcement has sought out commercial tools to identify people in public spaces, along with their internet, phone, and location history. Shanghai law enforcement, meanwhile, hired Shanghai Cloud Link and other firms to analyze posts and photos from Twitter and Facebook, reportedly combining commercial or public-facing data with government records like driver and voter registries to identify anonymous online accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Forbes reported that some Chinese data brokers sold access to personal information online to any willing buyer, not just government entities, for a few dollars. It is not clear how enactment of the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) in 2021 will affect the Chinese data brokerage industry. The PIPL, which includes provisions similar to those of the GDPR, requires private companies to process sensitive personal information only when necessary for approved purposes and limit data retention. It also mandates companies obtain individuals’ consent to process sensitive personal information, which includes data that could harm “personal dignity” or “personal or property safety.” It requires companies that use personal information to conduct algorithmic decisionmaking to follow transparency measures, conduct impact assessments, and allow individuals to opt out of targeted ads or solely automated decisions. Although the DSL and Cybersecurity Law allow government access to private sector datasets, these provisions could reduce the amount of information first-party platforms and data brokers process within China to begin with, depending on compliance and enforcement in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beyond legal authority to compel disclosure of personal information, the CCP has additionally shifted to contracting private companies that voluntarily sell datasets or analytics software to surveil citizens.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S. due process requirements under the Fourth Amendment and the ECPA are outdated, they generally provide stronger civil liberties protections than Chinese government agencies follow when compelling personal information from private companies. However, the relative strength of U.S. protections becomes less relevant if law enforcement agencies can bypass them by purchasing commercial data from brokers. Voluntary disclosure creates a significant gap the United States could close to strengthen civil and human rights, promote the long-term sustainability of cross-border data flows, and strengthen geopolitical alliances. Without stronger protections for uncompelled access to commercial datasets, it is more challenging for the United States to discourage other countries from engaging in similar practices and to distinguish itself as a global leader in human rights values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recent-us-legislative-developments&quot;&gt;Recent U.S. Legislative Developments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;federal-commercial-privacy-legislation&quot;&gt;Federal Commercial Privacy Legislation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Congress has proposed dozens of bills that aim to limit data collection, retention, and transfers in the private sector. Some examples include the ADPPA, Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA), and SAFE DATA Act, all of which propose a baseline for data minimization, or general limits on companies to collect, process, and share personal data only as necessary to provide a user service or fulfill approved purposes such as fraud or malware detection. Most proposals to update commercial privacy standards would also grant U.S. individuals the right to access, request, and delete personal information held by private companies, as EU individuals possess under the GDPR. These proposals could prevent both first- and third-parties from collecting extraneous data solely for the purpose of resale or targeted advertising and require them to obtain affirmative consent to transfer data to additional parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many major bills in the 116th and 117th Congresses excluded de-identified, aggregated, and publicly available data from their protections. However, as previously discussed, data brokers often collect and package such data or sell inferred insights in aggregate form, so these bills could exempt some business practices that pose privacy problems. In addition, there is ongoing debate over which data processing purposes should be either categorically or conditionally permitted. For example, the California Privacy Rights Act, but not the ADPPA, explicitly allows companies to process personal information for advertising or marketing services and analytic services, provided that the data are “reasonably necessary and proportionate” to the original purpose of collection. Federal commercial privacy legislation could indirectly reduce the amount of personal information available for domestic government agencies to purchase from brokers, but would not directly impose new restrictions for those that wish to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;proposals-to-modernize-government-access-to-personal-data&quot;&gt;Proposals to Modernize Government Access to Personal Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to its commercial privacy legislation efforts, Congress has introduced a smaller range of bills aimed at restricting the U.S. government from purchasing datasets from commercial brokers. The Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act, introduced in 2021, is the most high-profile such initiative to date. The bill’s premise was fairly straightforward: if laws like the ECPA or FISA would otherwise require U.S. government agencies to obtain a warrant or court order to compel traditional communications service providers to disclose Americans’ data, the same legal procedures should be mandated to purchase that information from a data broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act would not apply to all transfers between data brokers and U.S. government agencies, including those that lack an exchange of money or “anything of value.” It also would not protect non-U.S. individuals from the sale of personal information to U.S. intelligence or law enforcement agencies. Moreover, depending on interpretation, the bill’s definition of “covered customer or subscriber record” could exclude some types of personal information, such as biometrics, algorithmic inferences, publicly available data, or data relating to individuals who are not direct customers of a service. It prohibits government agencies from purchasing “illegitimately obtained information,” which companies obtain either deceptively or in violation of terms of service agreements. This could prevent some, but not all, transactions, especially since many privacy policies openly disclose (in vague terms) transfers of personal information to third parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Federal commercial privacy legislation could indirectly reduce the amount of personal information available for domestic government agencies to purchase from brokers, but would not directly impose new restrictions for those that wish to do so.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act focuses on the sale of information to the U.S. government, several export control bills emerged in the 117th Congress that would block U.S. data brokers from selling certain categories of personal information to specific foreign governments. The Protecting Military Servicemembers’ Data Act aimed to prohibit data brokers from selling personal information related to military personnel to countries like China, Russia, and Iran. In addition, the Protecting Americans’ Data from Foreign Surveillance Act, reintroduced in June 2023, would prevent private businesses from transferring sensitive U.S. personal information to certain countries such as China and create a list of low-risk countries where data can flow freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 118th Congress, legislators have proposed several bills in response to concerns that the CCP could compel ByteDance to hand over TikTok data or control of its content moderation algorithm. For example, the reintroduced ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act would direct the president to block social media companies, namely TikTok, that use certain algorithms and are located in a handful of countries, including China. The DATA Act would amend the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to allow restrictions on free flows of sensitive personal information, paving the way for the United States to ban TikTok or future Chinese companies. Also motivated by TikTok, the RESTRICT Act would direct the secretary of commerce to identify and potentially prohibit technology transactions relating to companies under the jurisdiction of six countries including China. The White House has endorsed the RESTRICT Act, even though it could further disrupt international data flows by creating another global adequacy system alongside the GDPR and the PIPL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-steps-to-regulate-us-data-brokers-and-their-interactions-with-government-agencies&quot;&gt;Next Steps to Regulate U.S. Data Brokers and Their Interactions with Government Agencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the U.S. data brokerage industry poses systemic risks to privacy and national security, it requires a comprehensive approach to rein in excessive data transfers across the ecosystem. Without across-the-board rules on how all U.S. mobile apps and data brokers transfer sensitive personal information, banning or divesting any single company, like TikTok, would not effectively prevent data leakage to foreign governments like the CCP. It is also worth noting that neither a divestiture nor forced data localization would stop U.S. domestic agencies from accessing Americans’ sensitive personal information — whether through TikTok or data brokers — in ways that could significantly impact privacy and civil liberties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the United States needs a multifaceted strategy that (a) imposes boundaries on how all U.S. companies process personal information, (b) places guardrails on U.S. government transactions with data brokers, (c) enforces purpose limitations on data transfers both within and outside the United States, while also protecting cross-border data flows, and (d) improves transparency and grants both regulators and individuals greater control over personal information. As Thorsten Wetzling and Charlotte Dietrich observe, the German Federal Constitutional Court, or the Bundesverfassungsgericht (BVerfG), put forward a double-door model in 2012 that demonstrated privacy safeguards on both sides of the data transfer relationship — the private sector seller and government buyer. In a similar fashion, both U.S. data brokers and government agencies now require greater accountability in a modern digital age. While Congress could implement some data privacy regulations in the short term, it is also important to consider broader open questions — such as the balance between safeguarding publicly available information, cross-border data flows, and free and open expression — that may require additional dialogue and research in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;short-term-actions-boundaries-on-data-brokers&quot;&gt;Short-Term Actions: Boundaries on Data Brokers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Federal comprehensive privacy legislation is necessary to regulate how all U.S. businesses, including data brokers, treat personal information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of the U.S. data brokerage industry is a result of an outdated privacy legal system that urgently needs modernization to keep up with more than 100 nations, including EU member states, Canada, and China, that have already established nationwide rules for how digital platforms process personal data. As a baseline, any forthcoming commercial privacy legislation should limit first- and third-party companies to collecting, storing, and transferring personal data only as necessary to offer a product that users explicitly request — and delete that information once the transaction or service is completed. This general rule should apply to both original data points and any related algorithmic inferences, including aggregate data that could potentially reidentify individuals or pose substantial privacy risks. In addition, such limitations on processing, retention, and transfers should apply to personal information that is widely accessible on the internet or through other means in cases where an individual’s right to privacy outweighs any public interest in that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All U.S. companies need clear rules on handling information, but commercial data brokers require enhanced transparency and oversight measures. Congress should require data brokers in all 50 states to register with the FTC, similar to existing provisions in California and Vermont. In turn, the FTC should create a Do Not Track portal to allow individuals to opt out of all data brokerage transfers in a single place. This concept has already been proposed in various forms, dating back to an FTC preliminary staff report on consumer privacy (2010), a Government Accountability Office report on information resellers (2012), an FTC report on data broker transparency (2014), the draft Consumer Data Protection Act (2018), the Data Broker Accountability and Transparency Act (2020), the SAFE DATA Act (2021), and most recently the ADPPA. The FTC already maintains a Do Not Call registry as a centralized portal for individuals to opt out of telemarketing calls, and a Do Not Track portal would be a logical extension of this concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, all digital platforms should publicly disclose the specific names of third parties they transfer personal information to, along with the third parties’ contact information, categories of data involved, and general purposes of transfer. Such disclosures could bring clarity to otherwise opaque data brokerage practices. Additionally, all individuals should have the right to understand how their personal information is processed and request to correct or delete it. Even if most internet users do not read privacy policies (and should not have to), more detailed public statements could benefit watchdog organizations and regulators, like the FTC, which have used terms and conditions to identify unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any forthcoming legislation should carefully craft a definition of “data broker” that extends beyond commercial transactions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data brokers operate under many different business models. The legal definition of a data broker is critical because it will determine which specific entities would be subject to any enhanced transparency or accountability requirements, like the registration and opt-out mechanisms proposed here. While some proposed frameworks like the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act focus on transactions involving money or other resources of value, data brokers can operate outside traditional financial exchanges. Kochava and Clearview AI, for example, have offered free trials or demos of individuals’ real-time location information and facial recognition photos, respectively. Data brokers could also voluntarily disclose sensitive personal information to law enforcement agencies without a tangible exchange in hopes of gaining future political goodwill or even to advance their own ideological beliefs — for example, opposition to immigration or abortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FTC’s 2014 definition of data brokers as “companies that collect consumers’ personal information and resell or share that information with others” can serve as a possible model for data sharing that may or may not involve an exchange of anything of value. However, as data collection and aggregation techniques continue to evolve, it will become crucial to monitor trends in the broader data brokerage industry and periodically revise legal terms as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;short-term-actions-boundaries-on-government-agencies&quot;&gt;Short-Term Actions: Boundaries on Government Agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congress needs to pass clear rules to govern how U.S. government agencies procure information from private sector entities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Congress has not significantly updated the U.S. privacy legal framework in decades, there is a significant amount of legal uncertainty over the application of traditional statutes to advanced commercial surveillance methods. To bridge these gaps, Congress should prioritize additional research into U.S. government commercial transactions with data brokers and ultimately establish bright-line rules to mitigate the potential for privacy or civil liberties abuses. Unless and until robust legal processes are in place, U.S. government agencies should either impose a temporary moratorium or voluntarily obtain a warrant in order to conduct transactions with data brokers, scrape photos or keywords from publicly available sources, and use facial recognition technologies on commercial databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. government agencies must improve public transparency and oversight around data access practices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration took some measures to improve transparency following the Snowden disclosures, including by declassifying some redacted documents related to FISA surveillance and participating in public hearings. But, in general, the covert nature of national security and law enforcement operations means most Americans are not notified of government surveillance, and many data brokerage transactions may not be disclosed to the public. The January 2022 ODNI report revealed that even “the IC does not currently have sufficient visibility into its own acquisition and use of CAI across its 18 elements,” demonstrating an absence of internal accountability mechanisms as well. The United States is currently undergoing a serious reckoning about racial profiling in state and local law enforcement partially due to increased public visibility, as bystanders can capture videos in public areas using their smartphones and many local police officers wear body cameras. Because many federal operations lack similar external and internal transparency, it is more challenging to exert public pressure to implement critical changes that could benefit society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of Congress previously introduced the Government Surveillance Transparency Act, which would lift most nondisclosure orders issued to technology companies after the surveillance period ends, and the NDO Fairness Act, which would establish necessity requirements to obtain gag orders and limit their duration to 60 days. The NDO Fairness Act, which passed the House of Representatives in 2022, would also require the DOJ to annually report the quantity and acceptance rates of nondisclosure order applications, as well as the number of individuals affected. To further enhance transparency, after an investigation concludes, federal agencies should directly notify all identifiable individuals whose sensitive commercial data (such as precise geolocation, communications, and biometrics) were obtained, with limited exceptions where disclosure might reasonably and significantly impact national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Office of the Director of National Intelligence releases the annual Statistical Transparency Report Regarding Use of National Security Surveillance Authorities, which provides generalized figures on the use of compelled mechanisms, including FISA and national security letters. As a next step, all federal agencies could release annual transparency and equity reports that describe any voluntary procurement of commercial datasets or algorithmic insights from private data brokers. At a minimum, these disclosures should include high-level statistics on the frequency, purpose, and context of data brokerage transactions; the specific identities and contact information of sellers; demographic trends within purchased datasets; and percentage of data access requests that contribute to adverse actions like an arrest. By increasing transparency, it is possible to strengthen public accountability for potential abuses of power or gratuitous access to sensitive personal information, inaccurate or discriminatory outcomes, and disparate impact on historically marginalized communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The FTC and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board need sufficient resources to carry out enforcement and oversight duties.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the FTC has decades-long expertise in data privacy and consumer protection, resource constraints may force it to make tough choices between litigating, settling, and passing over cases. In 2019, the FTC had around 1,100 full-time employees to oversee consumer protection across the entire economy, with only about 50 focused on data privacy. In comparison, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office had around 700 employees exclusively dedicated to data protection, despite having a smaller data brokerage market, a GDP approximately one-tenth the size of the United States, and one-fifth the U.S. population. As the U.S. digital economy continues to grow, FTC appropriations must similarly increase to help prioritize unfair and deceptive data practices or potentially enforce any future federal comprehensive privacy law. In addition, the agency could benefit from additional funding to conduct 6(b) studies on the effects of data brokers on competition in digital markets, especially for small- or medium-sized businesses that might not possess the data aggregation capabilities of dominant digital platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) was created to oversee federal government surveillance for counterterrorism purposes, but it may be necessary to strengthen its role and resources to monitor commercial data brokerage transactions as well. The Electronic Privacy Information Center recently called on the PCLOB to examine the use of facial recognition technologies, data-driven fusion centers, and geolocation history from commercial data brokers. The PCLOB could also probe government contracts for social media analysis by private data miners. In addition, the board should prioritize oversight into any potential disparate impact of surveillance on marginalized communities. In 2020, U.S. representatives Anna Eshoo (D-CA), Bobby Rush (D-IL), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) asked the board to investigate federal government surveillance of Black Lives Matter racial equity protests across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;short-term-actions-boundaries-on-both-data-brokers-and-government-agencies&quot;&gt;Short-Term Actions: Boundaries on both Data Brokers and Government Agencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While purpose limitations may be effective for private companies, U.S. government agencies need boundaries on their access to personal information in all contexts — no matter their perceived legitimacy of use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data minimization is a core principle of commercial privacy; businesses should collect, retain, and share personal information only if necessary to provide a requested product or service. However, most privacy frameworks also recognize that businesses may need to process personal information for other legitimate reasons, such as to prevent cybersecurity breaches, detect harmful or illegal activities, or issue product recalls. While the GDPR’s legal bases for companies to process personal information are broad (for example, with individual consent, to carry out “legitimate” or “vital” interests, or to fulfill a “public task”), they still establish a basic structure of categorically or conditionally permitted data processing uses that could serve as a general model for other privacy frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purpose limitations could be effective in the context of the consumer-business relationship, but U.S. government agencies need hard rules like modernized warrant requirements to govern their access to personal information — regardless of the context or original basis for data collection. The U.S. government should not unduly compromise privacy and civil liberties, even if it aims to address a legitimate national security threat. This is particularly important given the sheer scale of data brokerage: some firms advertise access to billions of data points, and most inevitably relate to individuals who do not pose any public safety risks. In addition to warrant requirements, government agencies need clear data retention and minimization rules to prevent unlimited secondary uses or transfers of Americans’ personal information, particularly geolocation, biometrics, and communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both companies and government agencies should follow specific legal processes to prevent biased or discriminatory outcomes stemming from digital surveillance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since historically marginalized communities have borne disproportionate consequences of surveillance, data brokers need formal procedures to promote civil and human rights. Just as medical and legal professionals have legal obligations to maintain client confidentiality, technology companies should bear duties to safeguard the equity, fairness, and security of their data processing and algorithmic outcomes — no matter if they develop or simply deploy the software. The United States has a body of federal and state civil rights law that prohibits some types of discrimination in specific contexts like employment, credit, or housing, but there is legal uncertainty around how pre-internet statutes apply to data brokerage activities. Therefore, Congress must explicitly recognize privacy as a fundamental civil and human right: no company should use or transfer data in ways that could create disparate impact or unequal digital participation based on factors like race, gender identity, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, age, or disability status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are ongoing debates around whether federal privacy legislation should include a private right of action, but it is important to note that many existing federal and state antidiscrimination statutes allow both individuals and government enforcers to sue companies for civil rights violations. By the same token, individuals should have a legal right to sue data brokers that collect, process, or share personal data in a manner that leads to discriminatory outcomes. On the government side, any federal or local agency that contracts commercial data brokers should undergo robust racial equity and ethics training and improve community engagement on these topics. Ultimately, though, government agencies need strict warrant requirements and public accountability over commercial data transactions to prevent abuse of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, all companies (including data brokers) and government agencies that either develop or deploy automated inferences should regularly audit their processes and outcomes for disparate impact by gender, race, age, disability, or religion. These risk and impact assessments could evaluate the type and scope of personal information processed, high-level demographic information of affected individuals, measures to ensure privacy and data minimization, and completeness of training datasets, particularly around highly sensitive decisions related to law enforcement or public benefits. Moreover, private companies and government agencies should be required to report their findings to Congress and the FTC, which can use the data to advance research on data brokers and inform future recommendations to prevent algorithmic bias or privacy violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;longer-term-actions-opportunities-for-future-dialogue-and-research&quot;&gt;LONGER-TERM ACTIONS: OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE DIALOGUE AND RESEARCH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any new guardrails on U.S. government transactions with commercial data brokers must also safeguard individuals from the aggregation of “publicly available” information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans should have a legal right to privacy in their personal information, regardless of whether they download mobile apps, post on social media networks, drive cars in public areas, or shop online. Several recent surveys suggest shifts in public attitudes toward privacy, although the majority of Americans still expect companies to safeguard personal information. A 2022 Morning Consult poll, for example, found that 92 percent of baby boomers, compared to 70 percent of Generation Z, expects companies to adhere to minimum privacy standards. As societal norms evolve in a digital era, it is possible for the conception of a “reasonable expectation of privacy” to change over time. Other traditional legal standards, such as the third-party doctrine, may lose relevance in a digital ecosystem powered by complex and nontransparent data transfers. Therefore, U.S. internet users need concrete privacy rights even in personal information that mobile apps and third-party data brokers exchange on the commercial market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because public information receives fewer constitutional protections, U.S. government agencies have stretched their interpretation of the term to the furthest possible limits. For instance, the DOD and the CIA consider publicly available data to be any information “available to the public by subscription or purchase” — a binary definition that even the January 2022 ODNI report acknowledges to be outdated. Information should not be considered public if government authorities can access it only through commercial data brokers, which, in turn, must scrape it from millions of websites against their terms of service or purchase it from mobile apps. The ADPPA broadly exempts publicly available information from privacy requirements, including data from “a website or online service made available to all members of the public, for free or for a fee.” Yet, this language could potentially strip information from protections the moment it is posted online, even if it still poses privacy concerns. This definition might also include content that users do not voluntarily upload to the internet and are unable to retract, including images captured by surveillance cameras in public places, or facial recognition databases where a person appears in a photo background without their knowledge or consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the long-term understanding of publicly available information will continue to evolve alongside society, Congress and government agencies can adhere to some basic principles more immediately. First, publicly available data should encompass only information that is reasonably accessible to the general population without paywalls, subscriptions, or advanced engineering knowledge. For example, if ICE needs to pay Barbaricum $2.1 to 5.5 million over five years to scrape online social media data, then that information should not be considered publicly available. As one precedent, the Supreme Court held in Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (1989) that a person’s rap sheet should not be considered public information, even if available through some channels, because it was difficult to access and therefore “practically obscure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the definition of publicly available should be limited to content that individuals affirmatively choose to disseminate to a wide audience — and, unless it is a matter of significant public concern, they should be able to retract it at any time. For instance, content that a politician uploads to their public Twitter account with millions of followers might be considered widespread dissemination, but the majority of Americans might not reasonably expect data miners to scrape personal photos intended for tight-knit circles like friends and family. Even in public areas, the geographic movements of most Americans are also not issues of public concern, and individuals often do not voluntarily choose to share them and cannot delete them under U.S. federal law. Public availability should not automatically void all privacy protections either; basic privacy protections should apply unless data are particularly newsworthy or serve a significant societal benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While data brokers need clear boundaries to prevent sales of sensitive personal information to adversarial individuals, companies, or governments, cross-border data flows are still vital to the United States and global economies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As surveillance technologies advance, several governments, including the European Union and China, have introduced measures that promote data localization or otherwise restrict cross-border data flows, citing national security or privacy grounds. But data localization alone cannot prevent privacy violations and sometimes enhances domestic government access to sensitive personal information. Moreover, overly broad restrictions on data flows can disrupt online communications and commerce, especially since almost all modern businesses operate websites or apps, conduct electronic global transactions, and otherwise depend on international data flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States weighs various options to address national security risks posed by mobile apps like TikTok and data brokers, it is important to consider how blanket restrictions on cross-border data flows could create unintended long-term consequences. Data localization could prompt other countries to institute reciprocal limitations on the United States or weaken global negotiations on free flows of data in the future. U.S. businesses have already experienced significant uncertainty after the CJEU’s Schrems I and Schrems II decisions threatened to curtail transatlantic data flows. When France joined the United States in blocking TikTok on government-issued devices in March 2023, it also added U.S. apps like Twitter and Netflix to that list. If even close political and economic allies like the European Union and United States cannot maintain trust in data flows, then further normalization of data localization could cause a breakdown of commerce and communications across the global economy. Moreover, even if forced data localization for TikTok or future non-U.S. mobile apps might slow foreign governments from accessing those specific databases, it could simultaneously streamline U.S. government access or potential misuse. Instead of data localization, the United States should promote free flows of information among allies along the lines of the Data Free Flow with Trust framework proposed under Japan’s Group of Twenty (G20) leadership in 2019 — a process that will require ongoing multilateral dialogues and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some bills, like the Protecting Americans’ Data from Foreign Surveillance Act of 2023, propose to use export control laws to prevent certain categories of personal information from being transferred to select foreign countries. Tailored limitations like these could prevent all data brokers and private companies from selling exceptionally sensitive personal information abroad while maintaining overall cross-border data flows. In the end, though, comprehensive privacy measures are the best way to mitigate risk by reducing the amount of extraneous data available to foreign and domestic entities. All U.S. data brokers and private companies should follow certain fair information practice principles: minimizing data collection to specific purposes, deleting data after it is no longer necessary, allowing stronger transparency and oversight, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boundaries on data transfers must also balance values of free speech and expression.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An individual’s right to privacy can sometimes come into tension with First Amendment protections on free speech and communications, especially regarding dissemination of publicly available, aggregated, or de-identified information. In Sorrell v. IMS Health (2011), the Supreme Court struck down a Vermont law that prevented pharmacies from selling prescription information to data brokers for marketing purposes, stating it could violate legal standards of “discrimination in expression” and commercial speech. Hoan Ton-That, CEO of Clearview AI, has cited the First Amendment to defend the company’s indiscriminate scraping of photos on public-facing websites. Yet Clearview entered into a settlement agreement in ACLU v. Clearview AI (2022) to halt access to its facial recognition database to private businesses and individuals nationwide and to temporarily pause sales to both public and private entities in Illinois under the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States should avoid imposing overly restrictive limitations on information flows, stronger privacy protections can also promote values of free speech and expression. China’s surveillance laws demonstrate how forced censorship can also lead to self-censorship, as fear of government reprisal can prevent individuals from expressing themselves through public or private online channels. Closer to home, experts at the Brennan Center for Justice and Georgetown University’s Institute for Technology Law and Policy warn that social media web scraping by U.S. federal and local police could have a chilling effect on constitutionally-protected environmental, reproductive rights, and racial equity activism. In this manner, clear parameters on how U.S. government agencies collaborate with data brokers can safeguard individuals’ right to speak openly, particularly for historically marginalized communities that have been disproportionately subjected to surveillance based on their race, religion, income, or location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The First Amendment is strong but not absolute, as the government can impose tailored restrictions on speech to advance important interests like individual privacy. However, sales of public, aggregated, and de-identified information are an underdiscussed aspect of federal privacy legislation. Additional congressional investigations and hearings may be necessary to gather civil society input on possible restrictions without raising undue censorship concerns. Furthermore, as Cameron F. Kerry and John B. Morris Jr. point out, legislative findings will be important to clarify congressional intent on this matter, which could help any forthcoming federal privacy bill withstand future constitutional challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As data collection and algorithmic analysis advance, Congress should thoroughly reevaluate conventional constitutional and statutory limitations on both compelled and voluntary disclosure of data to U.S. government agencies as a long-term objective.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the White House published a report acknowledging&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the laws that govern protections afforded to our communications were written before email, the internet, and cloud computing came into wide use. Congress should amend ECPA to ensure the standard of protection for online, digital content is consistent with that afforded in the physical world — including by removing archaic distinctions between email left unread or over a certain age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to updating the ECPA to ensure consistent privacy standards across companies like data brokers, any forthcoming reauthorization of Title VII of the FISA Amendments Act should codify the EU-U.S. DPF into statute and consider modernized privacy safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The failure to update the ECPA and FISA for the big data era has resulted in archaic distinctions such as the type of device or length of time a message has been stored. The ECPA assigns privacy protections based on categories like metadata or communications content, but since data brokers often derive algorithmic inferences from multiple sources, it is difficult to neatly label modern datasets by type. Title I of the ECPA, commonly referred to as the Wiretap Act, requires the FBI to obtain a “super warrant” to intercept certain real-time communications, but Section 702 of FISA allows the FBI to query incidental communications concerning U.S. individuals without a warrant. The Stored Communications Act mandates a warrant to access electronic messages stored for less than 180 days but only a subpoena or court order for those stored longer than that time frame, even as the increasing affordability of data storage leads individuals and private companies to retain messages for longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this report does not focus on compelled access requests under the ECPA and FISA, the rise of the data brokerage industry calls for a more holistic review of all forms of law enforcement access to private sector data. Congress can undertake this review by holding hearings and conducting investigations. The FTC reporting recommendations from subsection VIII (5) and (6) of this report would assist in this endeavor. Future discussions could also consider new statutory limitations on geofence or keyword warrants given their outsized potential to pose privacy or civil liberties risks to large numbers of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, stronger privacy guardrails on the commercial data brokerage industry would present both short- and long-term benefits for the United States. First, these could enhance the nation’s global reputation for data protection, which is essential to sustaining cross-border data flows and promoting economic stability for U.S. businesses. Even though many international dialogues like the EU-U.S. DPF continue to center around pre-Snowden compelled access to signals intelligence, instead of the rising prevalence of “voluntary” sales of personal information, clear boundaries on commercial data transactions could help build longer-term global confidence in both the U.S. public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stricter privacy measures are also vital to national security since data brokers can accumulate detailed personal information and transmit it abroad in ways that could advantage foreign adversaries. However, privacy is not only an economic and national security imperative; it is also an important human and civil right. There are moral and ethical grounds to both directly regulate the data brokerage industry and also reduce U.S. government dependence on it, particularly in light of racial profiling patterns in law enforcement. Without explicit protocols to restrict their interactions with U.S. government agencies, commercial data brokers risk reinforcing the disproportionate oversurveillance of individuals by factors like race, religion, or income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there are geopolitical implications to consider. By limiting domestic government surveillance, the United States can demonstrate the importance of privacy values for the rest of the world. In turn, stronger U.S. privacy protections could provide a meaningful starting point for longer-term multilateral dialogues on limiting non-U.S. government transactions with data brokers. While the CCP should be held accountable for mass surveillance of its own citizens, particularly the Uyghur and Kazakh communities, the United States is in a weaker position to counteract China when it has made unjust arrests and deportations using personal information acquired from millions of Americans without a warrant. As technology continues to advance, big data will become increasingly central to economics, national security, and human rights. Therefore, it is crucial to set strong precedents and smart policies for data brokers now in order to positively shape their interactions with government agencies for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent claims by Ukrainian authorities that six Russian KH-47M2 Kinzhal missiles were intercepted by a Patriot missile defence system in an attack on Kyiv led to a flurry of excitable commentary about the potential implications for Russia’s nuclear forces. Much of this is overblown. Russia has many options to conduct a limited nuclear strike if it so wishes, and neither Ukraine nor NATO’s missile defence capabilities could be confidently expected to simply prevent a Russian attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the successful intercept of at least one Kinzhal, alongside the larger number of verifiable interceptions of Russian cruise missiles such as the 3M-14 Kalibr, does pose interesting questions for Russia’s approaches to both conventional and nuclear coercion at the theatre level. In particular, it suggests that better integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) could allow NATO to complicate Russia’s ability to use conventional precision strike and non-strategic nuclear weapons to manage escalation and compensate for conventional military weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-we-know&quot;&gt;What We Know&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, we should be cautious about overstating the significance of the intercept. Though described as a hypersonic missile, the Kinzhal does not meet the standard of manoeuvrability at hypersonic speeds that has led other systems – such as the Chinese DF-17 – to be seen as qualitatively new capabilities. The missile is of the same family as the 9M723 aero-ballistic missile which is launched from the Iskander system. However, it still represents a challenging target for missile defence systems. In contrast to traditional ballistic missiles which fly on a parabolic trajectory, Kinzhal’s quasi-ballistic trajectory represents a more complex target for air and missile defence systems to track. Early in the conflict, it became apparent that the 9M723 is capable of deploying six decoys, which complicate the task of target discrimination in the missile’s terminal phase, including by mimicking things such as the radar return of the missile’s warhead. Given that the two missiles are nearly identical, this could be true of the KH-47M2, although the air-launched Kinzhal may also exploit its greater velocity to carry a larger conventional warhead, which uses up more space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likely intercept of at least one Kinzhal by a Patriot battery is thus noteworthy in certain regards. Though PAC-3 has demonstrated considerable effectiveness against short-range ballistic missiles in recent conflicts, achieving a very high intercept rate against ballistic missiles fired by the Houthis against Saudi Arabia, questions have remained regarding its effectiveness against more complex targets. In particular, doubts remain regarding its ability to achieve effective target discrimination when performing terminal-phase intercepts. Failed intercept attempts against Houthi Burkan 2H missiles during the war in Yemen were presumed to be a consequence of the failure of the system’s radar and the seekers on its interceptors to discriminate the missile’s separating warhead from the debris of its body. If the Kinzhals intercepted deployed decoys, as similar missiles such as the 9M723 have, this would suggest the effectiveness of the millimetric wave seeker on the PAC-3 interceptor at discriminating targets from clutter. Moreover, in its terminal phase, the family of missiles is claimed to have a speed of 2.1 km/s – well over Mach 5. Of course, if not carrying decoys then in certain ways a missile like the 9M723, which does not have a separating warhead, is a simpler target for interception for a system like Patriot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are caveats to bear in mind, however. First, the Patriots defending Kyiv were performing point defence over a target which it was known the Russians would prioritise – the city itself. Point defence against a missile like the Kinzhal in its terminal phase, though far from easy, is somewhat simpler than performing an intercept in its midcourse phase, when it is manoeuvring on a quasi-ballistic trajectory. As such, the ability to defend a specific target from the Kinzhal may not be illustrative of the ability of air and missile defence systems to provide wide-area coverage against such systems. In a conflict against Russia, some likely targets for Russian missiles will be well known – for example, major airbases and combined air operation centres. Other targets, however, such as command posts for ground units or components of national energy grids, will be more geographically distributed, and if a strike was not for purely tactical-operational purposes but had broader aims in mind – as could be the case in the event of nuclear use – Russia would have a broad range of targets to choose from. Moreover, we are still working with a small empirical base, and will require more reliable evidence that the Patriot is consistently effective against missiles based on the 9M723.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the event is particularly notable in conjunction with what we know about Ukraine’s intercept rates against Russian cruise missiles such as the 3M-14 Kalibr. While they struggled initially, by the end of 2022, Ukrainian air defenders were intercepting 70–80% of the cruise missiles fired by Russia. This is despite the fact that cruise missiles were used against a relatively wide range of targets and were manoeuvring in flight to confound assessments of their ultimate destination. If air and missile defences can deliver high intercept rates against Russian cruise and ballistic missiles, many of which are dual-use – and especially if these rates differ significantly from pre-war Russian expectations – this could have significant ramifications for both conventional and nuclear coercive strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-russia&quot;&gt;Implications for Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could have considerable impacts on both Russia’s planning for strategic conventional strike operations (otherwise known as “strategic operations for the destruction of critically important targets”, or SODCIT) and its low-yield nuclear options – two things that are closely interrelated in Russian thinking. Russian strategists show a preference for the use of conventional precision strike assets such as cruise missiles to deliver calibrated damage against an opponent, with nuclear weapons playing a passive enabling role by constraining an opponent’s retaliatory options. There is a body of Russian literature on the use of limited numbers of nuclear weapons to deliver “dosed” damage against an opponent if this fails. To the extent that this model of use and subcomponent objectives such as demonstration and intimidation are predicated on the assumption that relatively limited numbers of strike assets would be needed to achieve each mission – which is of particular salience with respect to nuclear use – this assumption will now come into question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could, of course, be argued that little has changed for Russia. The costs of layered IAMD remain prohibitive; one expert at the 2023 Air and Missile Defence Conference estimated that the costs to the US of protecting Guam alone would be in the range of $5 billion. While it is possible to erect a missile shield over a specific area such as Kyiv, scaling missile defence across a theatre will be much more difficult, and Russia has a variety of targets that it can strike for demonstrative purposes. Furthermore, given the scale of the missile threat faced by the US in the Indo-Pacific, it is unclear that large numbers of US systems – currently the backbone of alliance IAMD – will be available to NATO in the medium term. Ukraine, moreover, operated 250 surface-to-air missile systems at the war’s outset – the largest air and missile defence force in Europe, and one which was augmented by Western systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Air and missile defences capable of intercepting single targets across the European theatre create requirements for Russian planners which militate against the logic of limited nuclear use&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, there are potential lessons regarding the implications of a more robust European IAMD capability. The evidence from Ukraine does not necessarily suggest that point defence is the only achievable option. Missiles such as the Kalibr have been used against a wide variety of targets, and Ukraine’s ability to achieve relatively high intercept rates against them in a fairly large theatre is noteworthy – especially since cruise missiles carry the bulk of Russia’s low-yield throw weight. Defending a large theatre against ballistic missiles like the 9M723 and the Kinzhal would prove much more challenging, of course, but these missiles are fewer in number. Moreover, the relative success of Saudi air defenders against Houthi short-range ballistic missiles illustrates that ballistic missile defence (BMD) over a large theatre is achievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, realism should inform our assessments. There is no plausible and affordable NATO IAMD system which can defend every inch of alliance territory against Russia. Moreover, if Russia intended to use low-yield nuclear weapons to play on fears of subsequent escalation in order to achieve a peace on its terms, then it would not be constrained to attacking targets of military or strategic value; a demonstration almost anywhere would have the desired effect, and striking at some distance from anything of significance might be useful as a means of signalling restraint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are two important ways in which Russia’s strategic posture – including elements of its approach to nuclear use – would be impacted by more credible NATO IAMD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, air and missile defences capable of intercepting single targets across the European theatre create requirements for Russian planners which militate against the logic of limited nuclear use. The question is not one of whether Russia can be prevented from striking targets with low-yield nuclear weapons, but whether it can be prevented from doing so in a way that allows it to credibly signal limited intent. To signal this and thus avoid unintended escalation, Russia can only mate a limited number of warheads to their missiles and, moreover, must launch limited salvos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia also intends to use low-yield nuclear weapons on a much greater scale when a conflict escalates to the level of a large-scale war. For example, one of the performance criteria set for the Russian Navy by the country’s 2017 Naval Doctrine is the ability to do critical damage to an opposing fleet using non-strategic nuclear weapons. Such weapons would also likely be used in a regional war to target critical infrastructure such as airbases, which are difficult to shut down permanently using conventional capabilities. To the extent that Russia believes it needs larger numbers of missiles to achieve its aims at this level of warfare, this imposes constraints on the Russian system when a conflict is in its conventional phase. Every missile used for a conventional mission is one that will not be available for non-strategic nuclear use, and the production rates of ballistic missiles like the Iskander – roughly six a month – suggest this will be a major constraint. To be useful, NATO IAMD does not need to deny Russia the capacity to conduct low-yield strikes, but rather it needs to increase the number of missiles Russia requires in order to conduct these strikes, thus constraining its options for conventional targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is highly likely that Russia will remain capable of saturating the air and missile defences of well-defended targets, it can be compelled to do so in ways which will require expending ever-greater numbers of dual-use missiles. This would particularly be the case in a potential conflict with NATO. While it might be noted that systems such as Patriot provide fairly limited coverage, for many longer-range air and missile defence platforms, a major limiting factor is not the range of interceptors but that of radar. Networking maritime IAMD platforms or even systems like Patriot with the F-35 – as the US has in recent experiments – can readily increase their range. Maritime BMD capabilities such as the Aster-30 Block 1NT have a theoretical range of 600 km. If combined with external sensors – be it F-35 or a space-based sensor layer along the lines envisioned under the PESCO Timely Warning and Interception with Space-based TheatER surveillance (TWISTER) project – such interceptors could provide wide-area coverage against manoeuvring ballistic and quasi-ballistic threats. Though unsuited for defence against Russia (something they were not built for), the European Phased Adaptive Approach sites at Deveselu and Redzikowo could theoretically be modified to control a larger number of vertical launching systems and to contain a different mix of interceptors, much in the way an Arleigh Burke destroyer at sea would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, this is predicated on a level of capacity and integration that does not currently exist within the alliance, particularly in the case of its European members. Several points are salient here. First, the eventual success of projects such as TWISTER remains to be seen. Second, the level of integration needed to deliver results comparable to those achieved by F-35 and Patriot working in tandem may or may not be viable across an alliance which fields a number of air defence systems. Finally, achieving a level of rationalisation across air forces that would allow some to prioritise missions such as defensive counter air – while a prerequisite to any credible IAMD – may not be politically feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the process of overcoming these barriers exceeds the remit of this article, the important point here is that strategic effects can be achieved by improvements in IAMD well short of a preclusive defence of Europe against Russian missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-of-better-iamd-on-russian-strategy&quot;&gt;The Impact of Better IAMD on Russian Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, there is no plausibly affordable air and missile defence system that can cover Europe against Russian attack. However, an effective IAMD system capable of raising the number of missiles Russia needs to use to strike any given target could hinder elements of Russia’s strategy for missile use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Improvements in European IAMD could potentially require Russian plans for limited nuclear use to involve greater numbers of weapons, complicating assumptions about escalation management&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, if larger numbers of missiles are needed to strike assets that are likely to be on NATO’s critical asset list and defended asset list, then Russia will need to consider whether the operational utility of striking a target with conventional options – its preference – exceeds the cost imposed in terms of running down capabilities needed to maintain Russia’s nuclear credibility at the theatre level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia could lose some confidence in the idea of a nuclear “shot across the bows” as a tool to manipulate escalation in a reasonably controllable way. The premise of such an attack would have been that striking a high-value target with a missile precise enough to be detonated above the fallout threshold would enable nuclear demonstration at relatively low cost to civilians, thus limiting the risk of escalation. If, however, multiple missiles are needed to saturate a given target, then controlling escalation becomes considerably more difficult. For example, if NATO IAMD can draw data from a space-based sensor layer, then in order to use short- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, Russia first has to neutralise the satellites associated with projects such as TWISTER. In all likelihood, Russia might also believe it has to suppress any maritime BMD capabilities that NATO has at its disposal. Russia has struggled to replace the Soviet-era Tselina and Legenda satellite clusters, which used electronic signals intelligence and radar respectively to track carrier battle groups. Moreover, even China, which maintains a much more robust space-based ISR network, would have a difficult task tracking mobile maritime targets at very long ranges to the degree needed to enable conventional targeting. Finally, very large numbers of missiles would be needed to sink well-defended air defence destroyers. Russia could turn to the old Soviet palliative – the use of nuclear missiles at sea. Anti-ship missiles like the SSN-19 Shipwreck were built to be nuclear-armed, reducing the need for granular targeting and requiring fewer missiles to leak through to destroy high-value targets. The challenge, however, is that if nuclear missiles are needed to destroy or incapacitate targets such as air defence destroyers, this necessitates nuclear use on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if penetrating credible air and missile defences necessitated larger salvos, this could in turn require larger numbers of warheads to be mated to missiles, something likely to be noted by NATO intelligence. Unless Russia was willing to run the risk of failure, leading not only to embarrassment but also likely to serious consequences, these steps would defeat one of the prerequisites of calibrated nuclear use: the ability to communicate intent clearly to an opponent. Attacks on space-based assets would create some ambiguity regarding whether Russia was intent on destroying or disrupting early warning capabilities and thus preparing for a larger strike. Russia could mitigate this risk by targeting systems like the US’s planned hypersonic and ballistic tracking system or a comparable future European system in low Earth orbit, while avoiding early warning systems in geosynchronous orbit. The effectiveness of this distinction would depend on Western interpretation, however – something the Russians could not count on given how uncertain such assessments can be. We might think of how Western adversaries, real and simulated, responded in unanticipated ways during exercises such as Proud Prophet and Able Archer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem is compounded for Russia by two factors. First, the majority of the delivery systems for low-yield nuclear weapons are cruise missiles, against which interception rates have been especially high. The exceptions to this rule – the 9M723 and the Kinzhal – are available in more limited numbers. For example, it is estimated that Russia’s monthly production rate for the 9M723 is around six per month. Moreover, of the two missiles, only the Kinzhal is capable of striking targets beyond 500 km. Second, many of the launch platforms for low-yield delivery systems like the Kalibr are surface vessels which are vulnerable to early destruction. This is also potentially true of Russia’s strategic bombers, which can be targeted on the ground at the few airbases from which they operate – though this would certainly not be easy, given the dense air defences around these bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia can use submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) such as the Sineva to conduct low-yield strikes, and it has apparently developed low-yield warheads for the Sineva. The speed of an SLBM on a depressed trajectory means it is all but certain to be effective. However, at this point it becomes all but impossible to signal strategic restraint, or to ensure that an opponent can discriminate a Sineva carrying a low-yield warhead from a loadout of strategic warheads. Moreover, using SLBMs for non-strategic missions means eroding Russia’s strategic deterrent vis-á-vis the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-options&quot;&gt;Russia’s Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this should be taken to suggest that Russia cannot conduct low-yield strikes in Europe – the country’s arsenal of low-yield capabilities is too large and robust, and the range of potential targets is too broad. But improvements in European IAMD could potentially require Russian plans for limited nuclear use to involve greater numbers of weapons, complicating their assumptions regarding escalation management. The assumption that nuclear weapons can be coordinated artfully with diplomacy is likely to be increasingly problematised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Russia would need to be more judicious in its use of dual-use missiles for conventional strike missions, if a larger number of missiles are needed for many sub-strategic nuclear missions. This, in turn, would constrain Russia’s options for conventional countervalue targeting. Cumulatively, this could have the effect of pushing Russia towards the nuclear doctrine it espoused in 1999, when that year’s Zapad exercises involved the early and large-scale use of low-yield nuclear weapons against a putative opponent (likely NATO). The balance depends, of course, on whether the success rate differs from what Russia, NATO and Ukraine would reasonably have expected, a question which cannot be definitively answered based on open sources. But it should at least give cause to question some of the assumptions about what a Russian conventional missile campaign or “limited” nuclear strike might look like, which have been common in public discourse since the beginning of the war. In particular, a Russian attempt at “limited” nuclear use against NATO might be more complicated than feared, but – were it to occur – it would be more escalatory and even more potentially damaging than is sometimes hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭昨稱不同意楊岳橋和譚文豪記者會上的說法。辯方資深大律師潘熙遂播放片段，楊岳橋提及「我負責代表黨團講講」，指民主派若取得35+，而特首在施政報告不回應五大訴求，「公民黨係會同佢唔客氣⋯⋯以後政府每一個法案、財政撥款申請，我哋都會否決，呢個亦都係一個莊嚴嘅承諾」，而政府若到了3月財政財預算案仍不願退讓，他們都會「義無反顧」否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻表示，不同意楊岳橋指特首如未能回應五大訴求就會「否決所有嘢」，亦在李運騰詢問下認為楊代表「黨團」和代表「公民黨」說話有分別。鄭解釋，黨團是作為一個立法會最前線政策制定的架構，而若代表公民黨，「理應係經過執委會同意嘅一個決定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱楊岳橋說法僅代表當屆黨團-官稱即提空頭支票&quot;&gt;鄭稱楊岳橋說法僅代表當屆黨團 官稱即提「空頭支票」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，但楊是談及公民黨立會議員當選後的行為，而鄭望參選立會議員；陳慶偉補充，即若鄭成功當選並成為黨團一分子，楊便是代表他說話。鄭回應，認為楊的說法是代表當屆黨團，「實際未來黨團嘅一啲決定，應該由嗰一屆嘅黨團嘅人再決定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指，即楊是在提出「空頭支票（empty promise）」？鄭答「我認為係政治語言」，陳指即是「一個潛在的謊言（a potential lie）」，又問「這就是你說的？政治語言」，多人發笑；李運騰亦問是否「修飾的言辭（dress-up speech）」，鄭答「有機會係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱若預算案抛出橄欖枝多於缺失-不可能不同意&quot;&gt;鄭稱若預算案抛出橄欖枝多於缺失 不可能不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻在法官陳慶偉詢問下，亦指不同意要否決預算案，認為「要睇返實際財政預算案（內容）再決定」。被問是考慮什麼，他指認為「五大訴求做唔到，固然可能係政府嘅一啲缺失」，但同時政府必然會提出財政預算，「我哋冇可能唔睇當中嘅內容。」鄭續指：「到時候就係睇究竟個財政預算案入面，有幾多政府可以抛出嘅橄欖枝或者一啲派糖嘅措施，成件事再作一個平衡嘅檢視。如果佢派出嚟對市民有益嘅地方係多過缺失嘅，到時冇可能唔同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問，所以鄭其實已準備好以五大訴求與「一些橄欖枝和糖果」作交換（trade）？鄭答「係」。陳仲衡續指，但在能審視預算案前，鄭需先獲黨的支持才可當選，鄭同意，並同意他是想借助黨的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋先後稱代表黨團及公民黨發言-鄭不清楚是否代表黨立場&quot;&gt;楊岳橋先後稱代表黨團及公民黨發言 鄭不清楚是否代表黨立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後再播放楊岳橋的英語發言，楊指他不能代表民主派說話，但能代表公民黨說話，並指目標是不惜任何代價（at all costs）爭取五大訴求，若政府不回應五大訴求會否決所有議案和撥款。鄭重申不同意楊的說法，並同意李運騰指此處楊稱代表「公民黨」，與早前稱代表「黨團」發言不同。李指時任黨主席梁家傑坐在楊身旁，問楊岳橋說法是否代表黨立場，鄭稱不清楚，因不清楚楊與梁家傑有否對話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/poHtH96.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後播放譚文豪的發言，譚強調政府若沒有落實五大訴求，將「否決晒所有法案，否決晒所有撥款直至回應」，並指否決預算案後可解散立法會，若再否決特首便必須下台，「你問我下一步會繼續點，就係繼續否決。佢搵邊一個特首上嚟，佢一日唔落實五大訴求，我哋一日反對落去。」鄭同樣不同意譚說法。陳仲衡指即使如此，鄭仍望代表公民黨參選，鄭答「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱同意郭家麒發言-若有好預算案會同意差撥款才否決&quot;&gt;鄭稱同意郭家麒發言 若有好預算案會同意、差撥款才否決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後播放郭家麒發言，郭稱《基本法》容許議員否決政府不合理做法，以讓政府有約制、受監管，但「最終如果政府拎出嚟嘅政策，包括佢嘅財政預算，所有嘅政策係得到市民嘅接納，坐喺度嘅立法會議員，哪怕佢哋三十五個四十個，點解唔係投票支持呀？」，並指相反若撥款是胡亂增加警察開支，作為民選代表一定有責任反映民意，直至政府交出合理的預算和政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻表示同意郭家麒的發言，指他強調如有好的財政預算案和撥款，「無論立法會有35定40人，佢哋都會同意；只係話有一啲差嘅撥款，咁先會否決」，確認他投票前是考慮預算案的優劣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱若民意一面倒促五大訴求-相信理性政府會回應-沒預期入議會用否決權&quot;&gt;鄭稱若民意一面倒促五大訴求 相信理性政府會回應 沒預期入議會用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻在李運騰詢問下，指楊岳橋和譚文豪說法與早前的籌備會議沒有偏離，他亦預視二人說法，只是在籌備會議時他們沒表明一入立法會，由行政長官不同意回應五大訴求便開始否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭並重申，不同意會上較資深的黨員表明政府不回應五大訴求，便會否決所有議案和預算案；而當時若他當選，亦不會預期運用否決權否決所有議案，解釋因當時「距離真係審議財政預算案仲有一段好長時間」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭續指，「我深信政府會一直檢視民意同選舉結果去同民主派傾」，而當中有很多次檢視民意的機會，包括民主派初選投票人數、實際選舉民主派取得的議席數量，以及施政報告和財政預算案的諮詢，「如果民意係一面倒要求政府回應五大訴求嘅，我相信理性嘅政府係會作出回應。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問，那鄭認為當時政府是理性嗎？鄭答「我相信佢會係理性嘅」。陳追問即鄭認為當時政府是否事實上是理性，鄭答「係」，並指相信政府即使不是回應五大訴求本身，「都會喺財政預算案抛出一啲橄欖枝同埋一啲甜頭，等立法會議員去檢視實際嘅草案再作決定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱若當選後公民黨要否決預算案-最壞情況可退黨&quot;&gt;鄭稱若當選後公民黨要否決預算案 最壞情況可退黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭又同意，他區議員的工作會影響其投票立場，指若他在區議會旳一些民生主張放到立法會審議，會增加他投票支持議案的機會。辯方其後展示鄭參選區議會的選舉單張，寫有「專業用心 據理力爭」，陳仲衡一度問，鄭在單張上有沒有用任何「政治語言」，陳慶偉指即是「空頭支票」，鄭答：「描述嗰時嘅政治環境嘅時候有講，但民生嘅事項係好確實嘅事項。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，在2020年3月時，鄭達鴻有沒有想過若他當選立法會議員，而政府拒絕回應五大訴求，公民黨立場是要運用否決權，他會怎樣做？鄭指有想過，並表示「如果入到黨團改變唔到黨嘅立場，會申請議員豁免跟隨黨立場投票機制」。鄭昨提及該機制是容許議員向黨團申請，豁免跟隨黨立場投票，郭榮鏗亦曾使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，若其申請不被通過會怎樣做？鄭答「最壞嘅情況係可以退黨」。鄭最後重申，他2020年3月時無意在當選後否決預算案，直至2020年7月尾亦抱有同樣立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eVGZ8l6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（16日）踏入審訊第68天。鄭達鴻繼續作供，對於公民黨以黨名義簽署「墨落無悔」，鄭解釋當時有人質疑該黨為何不簽，而黨內議助和黨工認為「快快脆簽咗，個矛頭就會指向第二個冇簽嘅政黨」。鄭稱曾兩度表達反對，指若公民黨自視為民主派較大政黨，就不應「話簽就簽」坊間聯署，否則「黨格何在」，又重申支持者為理性溫和中產；而楊岳橋與譚文豪亦曾反對指不想簽「無窮無盡」聲明。鄭指其意見不獲接納，而公民黨終以黨名義簽署，「刻意同其他簽署者（以個人名義簽署）唔同，保留一啲彈性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，鄭達鴻稱港島協調會議就否決預算案只討論過「幾句」且無達成共識，他無收過任何協調文件，亦認為35+的目標是「十分之不可能」。對於曾於初選前的街站提及否決財案，他稱僅按楊岳橋指示帶出公民黨立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻稱只曾就35計劃與戴耀廷個別討論兩次-涉參選意向及票站&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻稱只曾就「35+計劃」與戴耀廷個別討論兩次 涉參選意向及票站&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻今繼續作供，表示與戴耀廷只曾就「35+計劃」個別討論兩次。第一次是在2020年3月中後旬，戴 WhatsApp 問他是否有機會代表公民黨於港島出選，他忘記如何回答，但「將個 message 拎去黨度問個黨」，後黨派了副主席賴仁彪與他一同出席首次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一次則是在6月尾，戴耀廷問鄭達鴻公民黨港島區議員有什麼票站，鄭同樣轉告黨，最後由黨總部回覆戴。陳仲衡問他有否保留與戴耀廷的記錄，鄭稱「警察沒收咗部電話」，亦不記得有否將記錄刪除。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻稱民主派港島6席取4席幾乎不可能&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻稱民主派港島6席取4席「幾乎不可能」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問及協調會議情況。就港島區協調會議，區諾軒曾供稱初選前有3次，初選後有一次。鄭指不記得初選前有3抑或4次會議，但「我知道嘅有出席晒」，包括初選後的一次，而首兩次會議賴仁彪均與他一同出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就3月26日的首次會議，會上討論於港島6席目標取4席，惟鄭稱認為「幾乎不可能」，解釋該目標緣於2019年區議會選舉大勝，但區選是「單議席單票制」，立法會選舉是「比例代表制」。鄭指要在比例代表制下取4席須有一個「接近完美嘅分票機制」，但民主派「從來冇一個咁科學嘅機制可以處理到」；加上當時民主派得票增加，但建制派得票亦多了很多，且2016年葉劉淑儀才是港島區獲最高票者，民主派要取4席是「接近不可能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭在法官陳仲衡詢問下，指會上沒有表達此意見，稱因為與會者「要有一個目標」，而現時民主派有3席，「佢哋就必然想更進一步。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭指會上亦有討論投票數目，司馬文提出因目標議席是4席，望選民能投4票。鄭有表達同意，指因公民黨在港島區傳統上有議席，但他是知名度不高的新人，「如果投一票，我未必係港島選民嘅首選，但如果投4票，我深信公民黨一定會係其中一席之中。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱港島首次會議-司馬文反對否決財案後未有再討論&quot;&gt;鄭稱港島首次會議 司馬文反對否決財案後未有再討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，鄭達鴻亦確認，首次會議上曾傳閱有關初選機制、由戴耀廷草擬的「35+計劃」文件；並指談及文件的實際操作時，戴耀廷突然提及否決預算案，提出「積極運用《基本法》」的概念，即「可以否決，可以唔否決，到時睇實際情況」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭指當時只有司馬文回應，稱反對任何關於否決預算案的想法，「反對用呢樣嘢約束任何候選人」，而戴耀廷聞言後「都冇再講嘢」。鄭指因為二人屬「根本性分歧」，故當時不認為有需要表達反對，該討論亦只有「幾句」、很快就結束，在之後的協調會議亦沒有提及。鄭在會議外亦沒有與其他參與者討論否決預算案的事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/08HiT7y.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱港島無就否決財案達共識無收過港島協調文件無人解釋提名表格共識意思&quot;&gt;鄭稱港島無就否決財案達共識、無收過港島協調文件、無人解釋提名表格「共識」意思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻表示，港島協調會議最終達成的共識有6點，包括舉辦初選、舉行選舉論壇、「贏咗先有得選，輸咗冇得選」、目標議席為4席、以「靈童制」為替補機制；至於投票數目，因最後投票系統不容許投4票，最終共識轉為投一票。而會上沒有就否決預算案達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，鄭表示會上也曾討論過要否簽一份關於「贏咗先有得選，輸咗冇得選」的文件，他記不清楚在哪次會議討論，當刻亦沒有最終決定，而最後也沒有相關協議或草稿出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示「35+立法會過半計劃 民主派港島協調機制（初稿）」，以及「35+立法會過半計劃 民主派港島區協調機制協議」，該兩份文件均提及積極運用《基本法》權力，包括否決財政預算案。辯方問鄭被控前有沒有收過，鄭指沒有，解釋因文件提到以「全票制」選出四張名單，即投4票，與協調會議共識的投一票不同，若他當時看到應至少會向主辦方詢問。鄭亦不知道戴耀廷有設立港島區WhatsApp的「廣播列表」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於所有參選人均有簽署的提名表格上，列明「確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派 35+ 公民投票計劃』及其目標」。鄭稱在2020年6月至7月期間，沒有人向他解釋過「共識」代表什麼，重申當時理解共識就是上述提及的6點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱反對簽墨落無悔-大黨不應話簽就簽-否則黨格何在&quot;&gt;鄭稱反對簽墨落無悔 大黨不應話簽就簽 否則「黨格何在」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;公民黨曾以黨名義簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，辯方續展示公民黨6月11日帖文，提及「公民黨已加入聯署【墨落無悔 堅定抗爭】聲明書」，又指早於3月25日召開記招，承諾尊重民主派初選機制，及「立會過半後政府必須落實五大訴求，否則公民黨將行使《基本法》賦予的否決權，否決包括財政預算案在內的政府議案、法案及撥款」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問公民黨何時首次討論「墨落無悔」，鄭表示是6月10日，指當時有議員助理和資深黨工發覺該聲明開始在網上廣傳，同時有人發訊息問公民黨「點解唔簽」，故議助和黨工遂在包含所有初選參與者、有約20至30人、用來籌備立會選舉的黨內 WhatsApp 群組，提出問要否簽署。有份發聲明的鄒家成聞言微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭續指，該些議員助理和資深黨工認為「呢啲咁嘅聲明，你快快脆簽咗，個矛頭就會指向第二個冇簽嘅政黨，因為呢個都係講緊選舉期間嘅公關舉動」，林卓廷和黃碧雲等發笑。鄭在陳仲衡詢問下表示，當時在群組兩次表達反對，稱「坊間呢啲咁嘅聯署，如果我哋覺得（公民黨）係民主派其中一個比較大嘅政黨，就唔應該話簽就簽，（否則）黨格何在」，林卓廷一度大聲說「吓？」。鄭續指，其後群組內成員討論了很久，「我就提醒佢哋都係要諗返我哋嘅 target audience，係一班理性溫和中產。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱楊岳橋譚文豪亦曾反對簽墨落-公民黨終以黨名義簽以保留彈性&quot;&gt;鄭稱楊岳橋譚文豪亦曾反對簽「墨落」 公民黨終以黨名義簽以保留彈性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問鄭有否表明不會簽署，鄭稱「我嘅意見係黨都唔應該簽個聲明」，當時亦有表達，但其意見不被其他人接受。鄭亦指，除他以外，楊岳橋與譚文豪一開始亦表達反對，稱「唔想再簽一啲咁嘅聲明，因為會開咗一個無窮無盡嘅聲明要我哋簽（的先例）」；但此外沒有人表示該聲明未能反映協調會議內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，為何聲明最終是由公民黨名義、而非個別成員簽署，鄭解釋當時討論從6月10日晚延續至翌日中午，不同人有不同意見，「去到最後佢哋就提出用公民黨嘅名義簽署，刻意同其他簽署者（以個人名義簽）唔同，保留一啲彈性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問鄭是否仍有相關 WhatsApp 紀錄，陳仲衡問還是他已刪除了？鄭答「可能有（刪除）」，指選舉時會定期刪除記錄。陳問他為何要定期刪除，鄭稱記憶中初選完結後群組無再起作用，「就叫我哋 delete」，在法官質疑下同意他說錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻網台稱共同目標撼動政權-解釋35可改政治版圖令立法機關制衡&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻網台稱共同目標「撼動政權」 解釋35+可改政治版圖令立法機關制衡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦多次就鄭達鴻於不同場合的發言，如帖文、電台節目訪問等，問他對當時言論的回應。其中2020年6月15日的D100節目《風波裡的茶杯》，控方指鄭於節目的發言提及簽協議與否不會破壞共同目標。辯方播放片段，有聽眾問為何35+計劃候選人不需簽「生死狀」以表達共同目標，主持吳志森回應時提及35+目的是望「撼動呢個政權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻續回應：「其實唔係話冇共同目標，共同目標就係撼動個政權、去用 35plus」，又指「其實一開始都講過簽唔簽呢樣嘢」，只是戴耀廷有一個「良好願望」，擔心《國安法》來時會影響很多人，想留「走盞位」才沒簽署。鄭續指，「咁當然有啲人想繼續有一啲共同嘅願望，咁所以之前有個聯署喺度，譬如公民黨都簽咗嘅。咁呢個就等每一個政團自己去考慮啦，呢個都好難去規限得到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙問鄭為何提「撼動政權」，鄭指只是沿用吳志森的說法，解釋認為「攞到議會過半，就可以改變以往嘅政治版圖，立法機關就唔會淨係被當作橡皮圖章，可以去返一個 checks and balances（制衡）嘅狀態」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱協調會曾討論簽署贏咗先有得選文件-官質疑控方證人無提過&quot;&gt;鄭稱協調會曾討論簽署「贏咗先有得選」文件 官質疑控方證人無提過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鄭提及「一開始都講過簽唔簽呢樣嘢」，鄭稱是港島會議上曾討論、但最終沒達成的「贏咗先有得選，輸咗冇得選」文件。陳慶偉質疑，3名控方證人作供時均無提及過有關文件，現在才首次聽聞。李運騰追問有否討論過要簽該文件、又問是何時討論，鄭稱有，是在初選前的第三或四次會議上。鄭又指忘記由誰提出，但過往的初選都有表格列明「贏咗先有得選，輸咗冇得選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於為何提及「良好願望」及「走盞位」，鄭解釋因當時有新聞指初選會被指為操縱選舉，這是為免有機會被人追究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;公民黨6月辦街站-鄭達鴻獲余若薇及陳淑莊推薦&quot;&gt;公民黨6月辦街站 鄭達鴻獲余若薇及陳淑莊推薦&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方後播放公民黨2020年6月19日街站片段，出席者包括鄭達鴻、余德寶、余若薇、陳淑莊、楊岳橋、譚文豪、郭家麒及李予信。鄭表示街站主要目的是宣布參選及造勢，及介紹兩個新人包括他及李予信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/H6Q873W.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;街站片段顯示，余若薇發言介紹鄭達鴻，指他非常努力取得法律博士學位，望用法律背景為香港人服務，是「不可多得、勇敢、有承擔嘅後生仔」，籲選民支持。陳淑莊則提及鄭2016年與她「同一條名單」，為人努力上進；又指自己因佔中案判刑未能參選，但望通過初選爭取35+，落實「港人治港」及一國兩制。陳之後亦有介紹李予信，指他在「超紅」的錦屏區勝出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭回應記者時提否決財案-解釋指遭楊岳橋拉埋一邊要求帶出黨立場&quot;&gt;鄭回應記者時提否決財案 解釋指遭楊岳橋「拉埋一邊」要求帶出黨立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;片段顯示街站完結後鄭達鴻接受記者訪問，被問現時「選舉主任大兜亂」，對其參選資格有何影響，鄭回答：「《國安法》嚟臨，相信政權都會用唔同方式打壓參選人嘅參選資格⋯⋯無論揸刀嗰個人係邊個，呢把刀係一定會邁向所有民主派候選人當中，所以民主派必定要團結去力爭35+，可以喺嚟緊立法會度否決財政預算案，同埋可以為香港人爭取落實五大訴求。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/p9f6ZO9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
▲ 左起：楊岳橋、鄭達鴻、李予信（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙問為何記者問及參選資格，但鄭回答時卻談及否決預算案。鄭解釋在造勢大會前，「楊岳橋拉埋咗我喺一邊」，稱「今日個焦點就係聚焦介紹你」，故著鄭負責回答記者問題。鄭指楊提醒他要帶出黨「否決財政預算案爭取五大訴求」的立場，因此即使記者問題未必相關，「我都係拉咗去講否決財政預算案。」鄭同意陳仲衡所指，他只是依照楊岳橋的指示說明該黨立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fb帖文提否決預算案逼特首下台-鄭稱由助理發布-被捕後才發覺感愕然&quot;&gt;FB帖文提否決預算案逼特首下台 鄭稱由助理發布 被捕後才發覺感愕然&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示鄭達鴻專頁6月23日的公開帖文，提及「我哋會透過否決唔同方案，包括否決財政預算案，逼令特首下台，從而去爭取五大訴求」，控方指控帖文顯示鄭會否決預算案，支持串謀。鄭指該專頁由他和6至7個議員助理管理，而他2021年1月被捕後查閱自己的記錄，才首次留意到該帖文，發現是由助理所寫。鄭指助理發文前沒告訴他，而鄭於2021年2月至3月的截圖，顯示帖文由「Bear Pui」發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰說，故鄭是說其助理背着他做事？鄭重申他當刻沒留意到該帖文。李再問他發現時是否驚訝，鄭稱「有愕然，因為佢寫嘅呢個說法同我（專頁）其他 post 都唔同」，形容「有幾大分別」。李問鄭有否其他帖文可展示，鄭稱沒有，指已按《國安法》保釋要求關閉臉書專頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱6月中已出現公民黨統一口徑&quot;&gt;鄭稱6月中已出現公民黨統一口徑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後問為何其助理如此撰寫，鄭稱不知道，但覺得助理當時是跟隨了黨在3月25日記者會的立場，並確認助理是由黨支薪。陳仲衡問鄭有否告訴助理自己反對無差別否決預算案，鄭指有，李運騰遂問故當時助理刻意違反他的指示？鄭稱當時已出現黨的「line to take」，有「統一口徑」。鄭在李運騰詢問下，指該「統一口徑」在6月中出現，代表公民黨立場。辯方稱就此有文件要展示，押至下周一（19日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱民主派達35十分之不可能&quot;&gt;鄭稱民主派達35+「十分之不可能」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，鄭達鴻稱民主派要達到35+是「十分之不可能」，因比例代表制加上票數不足，地方選區很難取得「6 6 4 4 3」議席；而功能組別分為團體票及個人票，前者本身有很多指定團體，「民主派根本完全無機會」，很多界別亦很難登記做個人選民，像體育、演藝、文化及出版界、進出口界、批發及零售界等，雖民主派有派人參選，「但完全冇諗過係可以當選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續指，但3月25日公民黨記者會上鄭亦有舉紙牌宣傳選民登記，問他是否以行動令更多人支持民主派？鄭同意，但指即使如此，「新嘅選民登記都不能夠翻轉嗰幾個界別。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This commentary was prompted by the recent publication of a RUSI article entitled “The Financial Action Task Force’s Challenge with Russia”. Rather than representing a genuine attempt at a balanced analysis, the piece appeared to be timed for the upcoming FATF plenary session scheduled for 19–23 June 2023, where another attempt to blacklist Russia is expected. I therefore think it is important to present some counterarguments to the position outlined in the RUSI contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is the international organisation that establishes and polices the implementation of global standards for combatting money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing. Since its establishment in 1989, the mandate of the FATF has expanded from exclusively tackling the former to also include the latter two. Together with the expansion of its mandate, the organisation’s authority and reputation have also grown, turning the FATF into a global standard-setter and watchdog. Despite increasing its role enormously, the organisation still presents itself as a technical rather than a political body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her piece, the author states that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“… for those that view the FATF as a politically motivated organisation, such a decision will further erode the FATF’s integrity and negatively impact its reliability, as well as facilitating the further politicisation of the organisation. Rather than conceding to political pressure and blacklisting Russia, the FATF should aim to devise more thorough and better crafted standards to ensure that illicit finance threats do not remain outside the scope of its recommendations and country assessments”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this position is extremely similar to that of one of the FATF’s permanent members – Russia. Namely, Russia blames the FATF for neglecting its recent mutual evaluation results and for politicising the process as a whole. While some might suggest improving FATF procedures instead of blacklisting the country, we should keep in mind that Russia’s violent aggression has already taken the lives of tens if not hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, and will take hundreds of thousands more if not stopped using all available means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the FATF’s mandate, one of the organisation’s tasks is “Identifying and engaging with high-risk, non-co-operative jurisdictions and those with strategic deficiencies in their national regimes, and co-ordinating action to protect the integrity of the financial system against the threat posed by them”. The FATF maintains a list of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action (also known as the “blacklist”). These countries exhibit “significant strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and financing of proliferation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2022, the FATF admitted that Russia’s actions ran contrary to the organisation’s core principles, representing a gross violation of the commitment of FATF ministers to implement and support the FATF Standards. Later, in April 2022, FATF ministers recognised that Russia’s actions posed a threat to the integrity, safety and security of the international financial system. Furthermore, in June 2022, the FATF decided to limit Russia’s role and influence within the FATF. The limitations were tightened even more in October 2022, until eventually in February 2023 Russia’s membership of the organisation was suspended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia’s violent aggression has already taken the lives of tens if not hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, and will take hundreds of thousands more if not stopped using all available means&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Russia is engaged in terrorist financing. Alongside its regular armed forces, Russia uses the private military company Wagner to conduct hostilities in Ukraine. The latter organisation operates in coordination with the armed forces, has a hierarchical structure and acts in the interests and with the consent of the highest military and political leadership of the country. Wagner is openly provided by the Russian authorities with military equipment including tanks, howitzers, multiple rocket launcher systems, armoured vehicles and fighter jets. However, the group’s activities go far beyond the Russian-led war in Ukraine and endanger international security on a global scale. Wagner’s engagement in a number of other armed conflicts around the globe, combined with the threats posed by its leadership, falls under the criteria for “terrorist activity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the US designated Wagner as being responsible for or complicit in – or having engaged in, directly or indirectly – actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty or territorial integrity of Ukraine. Furthermore, in November 2022, the Department of State designated Wagner for operating in the defence and related materiel sector of the Russian economy. Moreover, Wagner has been sanctioned by Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK and the EU. Most recently, in February 2023, the Ukrainian Parliament also designated Wagner as an international criminal organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area of concern falling directly under the FATF mandate is proliferation financing. Beginning in 2022, Russia has deployed Iranian-made drones to attack Ukrainian territory, including civilian targets. This has been confirmed by multiple public sources. Furthermore, the transfer of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to Russia has been acknowledged by Iranian officials. This is an obvious infringement of the 2015 UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which explicitly prohibits any country from receiving these types of drones from Iran without prior approval by the Security Council. Given that no such approval was sought from or granted by the Security Council, these transfers represent violations of resolution 2231.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent media reports confirm that cooperation between Russia and Iran on armed drones is of a continuous and sustained nature. Moreover, intricate schemes including the use of a state-owned airline are being deployed to illegally deliver UAVs from Iran to Russia. The expanding range of arms and technologies being supplied confirms the long-standing nature of cooperation between the two states. This obviously requires an immediate response by the FATF, as it entails immense proliferation financing threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, the examples mentioned above prove that Russia poses a danger to the international financial system, as it is engaged in terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation activities. Therefore, these activities have to be addressed using all available instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to its mandate, the FATF assesses the compliance of individual countries with international standards, and in cases where states fail to comply with the rules, it has powers to sanction them – namely by putting them on either a “blacklist” or a “greylist”. This should not be regarded as a “punishment”, but rather as an incentive for the sanctioned country to take the necessary steps in order to fix its deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when it came to protecting the international financial system from an FATF member aggressively violating everything the organisation stands for, the FATF took a cautious stance, asserting its “non-political” status. But it should be pointed out that the FATF’s response in this case is dramatically different to what would be (and in fact has been) rapidly applied to Iran, for example – which suggests a political rather than a technical position on the organisation’s part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If a respected organisation such as the FATF cannot deal with a criminal at its table, this casts a dark shadow on its viability in the long run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The designation of a particular country as high-risk is a comprehensive technical process with many safeguards built into it. The FATF has already applied a phased approach involving the gradual application of stringent measures, which makes it hard to accuse the organisation of overstepping its mandate or acting impulsively. Moreover, the organisation’s steps reflected the actions of Russia, meaning that the measures taken were in response to a blatant breach of the FATF’s mandate and principles. Prompt and meaningful steps from Moscow’s side would obviously have prevented further negative consequences for Russia, but there are no signs that such steps could be expected in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, during the technical process of assessing whether or not Russia has the necessary protective measures in place to prevent threats to the integrity of the global financial system, the international community managed to incorporate unproductive discussions on the political nature of such an assessment in cases where the breaching jurisdiction is a member of the watchdog. This can only have been a cause of satisfaction for the Russians. In order to keep the discussion going, the aggressor country is even resorting to intimidation of FATF members. It is threatening to terminate contracts important to FATF member states if they dare to support its nomination to the greylist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of revising the FATF standards as well as considering the role of the organisation appears to be an attempt to move the discussion away from the main problem. The reality is that the FATF is constantly striving to improve. Most recently, it agreed upon a new updated Mutual Evaluation Methodology and updated its Mutual Evaluation Procedures. In particular, the FATF decided that the next round of assessments will have a greater focus on effectiveness and will take a more risk-based, targeted approach. Moreover, future assessments will be more frequent, with the time between assessments halved to six years. Given the above, it is important to avoid conflating separate issues. It is true that the mutual evaluation mechanism should be improved, but this has nothing to do with immediate response to an FATF member aggressively violating everything the organisation stands for. And the only possible response is blacklisting the violator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the RUSI article claims that “if the aim is to target illicit finance originating from Russia, then while blacklisting will ‘name and shame’ the country, it will fail to systemically address the illicit finance problem emanating from Russia, which either has not been detected or has been underestimated for many years”. Since there is no explanation for this statement, I would put forward an opposing view: that blacklisting Russia will actually block most of the mechanisms currently used by the aggressor state and designed by Russia’s Central Bank, Ministry of Finance and intelligence services to evade sanctions and continue polluting the global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been regular reports of Russian agents establishing entities around the world with the involvement of offshore jurisdictions – as well as “neutral” countries and those where Russian spy networks are stronger – with the aim of purchasing components for weapons including cruise missiles, bombers and even intercontinental ballistic missiles. Classical GRU (Russian military intelligence) and SVR (Russian political/economic intelligence) covert operations are difficult to trace in the current circumstances. However, any money transfer originating in Russia could attract additional attention from correspondent banks and financial intelligence units around the world at the very beginning of its path if Russia is blacklisted – and this will significantly complement the sanctions regimes in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may be cautious about isolating Russia from the global financial system. However, one should think of the threat it poses, the moral case for action, as well as the authority of those making decisions. If a respected organisation such as the FATF cannot deal with a criminal at its table, this casts a dark shadow on its viability in the long run – one only needs to look at the latest statements from the UN, which is facing the exact same situation. In addition, we need to be smart enough to look beyond the horizon for looming threats in the not-so-distant future, sending a loud and clear signal to those that consider themselves to be superpowers: “The rules are the same for everyone and have to be respected. No crime will pay”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第67天。代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘昨欲將吳的受訪錄音和電郵呈堂，遭法官質疑屬傳聞證據。石書銘今重申望以證據反映吳當時的思想狀態，法官李運騰提醒，吳政亨受訪談及望協助戴耀廷的「35+計劃」的部分，性質或涉「牽連罪責」（inculpatory），若容許呈堂法庭便會視為「混合式」陳述，即同時包含被告涉嫌罪責和開脫罪責的部分。辯方確認屬知情決定、知道相關風險，法官終批准將相關證物呈堂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱電郵和錄音反映吳政亨思想狀態-法官稱或涉牽連罪責部分&quot;&gt;辯方稱電郵和錄音反映吳政亨思想狀態 法官稱或涉「牽連罪責」部分&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘昨傳召3名辯方證人，要求將吳政亨與另一人來往的4封電郵、和吳受訪的錄音呈堂，惟法官質疑屬傳聞證據，除非涉對被告不利的招認，否則不能呈堂，並要求辯方今早就此陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘今同意，兩項證據性質均屬「傳聞證據」，望以此顯示吳的思想狀態（state of mind）。法官李運騰問是反映整個控罪期間、抑或某一日的思想狀態，石指至少是由串謀形成至吳2020年6月17日受訪的時間。惟李運騰即指，吳政亨於7月1日也在《蘋果日報》刊登頭版廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰又指，即使訪問的確能顯示吳在某段時間的思想狀態，但吳在訪問中亦有表示望協助戴耀廷的「35+計劃」，向潛在參選人施壓令他們遵守初選機制。李指該部分證據性質或涉「牽連罪責」（inculpatory），若容許呈堂，法庭便會視之為「混合式」陳述（mixed statement），即同時包含被告涉嫌罪責和開脫罪責（exculpatroy）的部分，石表示明白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官准吳政亨錄音及電郵作為混合陳述呈堂-辯方確認屬知情決定&quot;&gt;法官准吳政亨錄音及電郵作為「混合陳述」呈堂 辯方確認屬知情決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，故辯方認為即使該訪問錄音以「混合式陳述」呈堂，並只是用以顯示被告於某段時間、而非全段控罪時間的思想狀態，也沒有問題？石表示明白，並稱相信法庭會全盤考慮證據。李運騰指那當然，並再次向辯方確認這是否知情的決定（informed decision）、並知道相關風險，此時在被告欄的吳政亨不住點頭，石書銘確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪表示，若辯方立場是接受證據作為「混合式陳述」呈堂，便不會反對，但關注辯方稱反映的思想狀態與案何關。法官陳慶偉指尚未知如何反映其思想狀態，留待結案陳詞處理，李運騰亦指之後會裁定證據是否相關，及如相關會佔多少比重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於就吳政亨是「李伯盧」電郵帳戶的持有人，控方指沒有基礎同意，由法庭推斷。陳慶偉指即控方不反對，亦不認為需花更多時間，「這是常識（common sense）的問題。」法庭最終容許辯方將相關電郵截圖及錄音以「混合式陳述」形式呈堂。吳政亨案情完結，續由鄭達鴻作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第67天。前公民黨區議員鄭達鴻開始作供，供述於2012年後入黨的工作，稱曾支持建制派提出的區議會撥款，及於2019年11月獲警方允許進入理大勸學生離開。鄭又曾任公民黨執委，惟認為在決策上，由立法會議員組成的黨團「凌駕咗執委會」，執委會功能「好似橡皮圖章」，只是象徵式通過黨團已討論的事項；即使有強烈不同意見，但「永遠說服唔到最高權力嘅決策者」，只能不情願地跟從，不會形容該過程為「民主」。鄭又稱，因無法接觸真正決策核心，故2016至2018年任副秘書長後無續任，改為任政策倡議執委，惟其倡議無一被接納。鄭2020年12月退黨時發文對此表達不滿，指無論就公民黨的內事和外事「慚愧地我改變不了任何一件事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻開始作供-曾修讀社會政策及法律博士赴內地交流&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻開始作供 曾修讀社會政策及法律博士、赴內地交流&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官今早准吳政亨一方將吳的受訪錄音和電郵呈堂，吳政亨案情完結，其後由前公民黨黨員鄭達鴻作供。身穿西裝的鄭達鴻確認，他1988年於香港出生，2007年在香港大學專業進修學院修讀社會科學副學士，2009至2012年在理工大學修讀社會政策及行政學系，2016至2018年在城市大學修讀法律博士，2019年獲認可為調解員，並於2020年完成法學專業證書（PCLL）課程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭表示，在理大期間曾於2011和2012年到南京和內蒙做交換生，解釋香港與內地關係密切，故當時想了解多些內地，及「睇吓我讀嘅社會政策同行政，可以點樣喺內地實施好啲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱感公民黨無投放足夠時間服務基層-故入黨後由草根地區做起&quot;&gt;鄭稱感公民黨無投放足夠時間服務基層 故入黨後由草根地區做起&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭又指，他2011年在課程要求下，到公民黨九龍西支部做實習，解釋當時認同該黨理念，即在一國兩制之下為港人服務，及「好堅持專業嘅價值」。鄭續指，當時正值區議會選舉前夕，其角色是協助該屆候選人，惟經過兩三個月感覺「公民黨嘅候選人有協定，冇擺足夠嘅時間同心機去服務最基層嘅街坊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭其後於2012年尾加入公民黨，並指上述經驗令他加入後，「由最基層嘅草根地區出發」，望藉做多些地區工作「為個黨提供更加多貼地嘅聲音」。鄭入黨後任地區發展主任，主要負責居民生活問題，包括法律福利及地區配套如交通黑點的改善。鄭於2015年當選北角（丹拿）區議員，於2019年成功連任，但沒有完成任期，於2021年5月11日辭職。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱區議會曾支持建制派撥款曾獲警方允許入理大勸學生離開&quot;&gt;鄭稱區議會曾支持建制派撥款、曾獲警方允許入理大勸學生離開&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻表示，任區議員除改善居民生活和地區配套，亦處理規劃問題，如擴建東區醫院、建共融遊樂場，及一些活動的撥款審核。他曾加入多個委員會和工作小組，包括規劃工程及房屋事務委員會主席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭指，於區議會有機會與建制派合作，形容彼此「政治上針鋒相對，但係民生上就互相合作」，如在地區無障礙設施和東區醫院擴建上合作；他亦曾支持建制陣營撥款，包括「一帶一路」的學校申請、青年京劇活動和東區足球隊，解釋投票時是「審視返嗰個項目對東區居民嘅利弊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭亦確認，任議員需與警察合作，指除地區治安問題，最特別是2019年11月25日他是五名獲警方允許進入理工大學的當選區議員之一，「去勸嗰陣時啲學生出返嚟。」法官陳仲衡指這是因為他是理大舊生，多於因他是區議員，鄭指兩者「相輔相成」，認為是因他同是理大校友和新當選區議員，故警察同意此人選，亦同意辯方指他熟悉理大內環境。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻指公民黨決策由執委會及黨團負責曾任執委但無加入黨團&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻指公民黨決策由執委會及黨團負責、曾任執委但無加入黨團&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就公民黨的決策，鄭達鴻表示主要由執委會及黨團負責，前者的功能理論上是就着當時的政治形勢作出政治決定，以及處理行政工作。鄭稱案發時的執委會任期由2018年12月開始，直至2020年11月，通常逢星期二晚開會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年7月執委會的架構圖，鄭表示本案被告之一的楊岳橋為公民黨黨魁，譚文豪是地區發展執委，被指為共謀者的郭榮鏗是黨務發展執委，而郭家麒非當屆執委會成員。鄭入黨後亦曾任執委會成員，包括2014至2016年擔任青年公民主席，2016年12月至2018年11月任副秘書長，後於2018年12月至2020年11月任政策倡議執委。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黨團方面，鄭指成員包括當屆立法會議員及其議員助理、黨顧問，另外若有需要會邀請一些元老，而黨魁是領導黨團的人。鄭指自己於2020年1月至11月期間並非黨團成員，而楊岳橋、譚文豪、郭家麒、郭榮鏗、陳淑莊以及他們的議員助理，均為成員之一。就黨團的功能，鄭表示他們會就着立法會最前線的政策及決策，與跨黨派接觸聯繫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭指執委會遭黨團凌駕變橡皮圖章-不會形容黨內決策過程為民主&quot;&gt;鄭指執委會遭黨團凌駕變「橡皮圖章」 不會形容黨內決策過程為民主&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到黨團與執委會的關係，鄭表示「黨團凌駕咗執委會，執委會功能好似橡皮圖章咁」。他解釋指：「公民黨傳統係由立法會議員起家，黨嘅架構唔係咁穩陣，所以向來都係立法會議員話事。」他又指立法會議員「經常認為自己喺立法會最前線工作，有最前線嘅資訊，所以做決定係理所當然」，而且黨團成員與執委會成員高度重疊，「所以有啲嘢黨團已經傾好咗，先至去執委會象徵式咁通過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰即問，鄭是否有時不同意黨團所作的決定？他指「有時係我喺執委會表達過反對」。李續問如何解決分歧，是否由投票處理，鄭否認，並指「點解我會形容係橡皮圖章，就係因為最後都係黨嘅最高層話事」。李指他不明白，問即使執委會上有不同意見，主席仍會做最終決定？鄭指基本上是由主席和立法會議員決定，而他們在執委會並非大多數。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱公民黨雖自稱雙頭馬車-惟大部分由黨魁決定&quot;&gt;鄭稱公民黨雖自稱「雙頭馬車」 惟大部分由黨魁決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再問，即有意見分歧時，是少數人意見優先？鄭表示：「我會話係當嗰個最高層嘅決策核心，有一個取態嘅時候，其他人就會慢慢去由唔同意見轉為跟從。」李問是否即逐漸被游說，鄭答：「其實有時嘅情況係，即使有啲人好強烈嘅表達意見，最後都永遠說服唔到最高權力嘅決策者，然後就係跟隨黨嘅最高決策者嘅決定。」李追問即不情願地（reluctantly）跟隨？鄭答「係」，李再問那鄭會否形容這過程為民主？鄭答「唔會」，旁聽席傳來輕聲驚嘆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭在法官陳慶偉詢問下，指當時楊岳橋為黨魁，梁家傑為主席。陳慶偉問，即誰的權力較大（“Who is bigger than the other?”）？被告席傳來笑聲。鄭表示公民黨有立法會議席後，稱為「雙頭馬車」方式，但事實上黨魁在執委會時已經過黨團一輪討論，「大部分都係黨魁決定」，而黨魁有需要可邀請主席參與。鄭確認，案發時梁家傑並非立法會議員，並非黨團常設成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;資深大律師潘熙其後再問，為何鄭達鴻稱黨團凌駕執委會，鄭解釋，他2016至2018年任黨副秘書長，該職位是新增，原本設計為未來接任秘書長，在執委會角色算重要；惟該兩年間，「我會發覺好多重要嘅決定，其實都係由黨團討論完，黨魁嚟匯報，我接觸唔到真正決策嘅核心」，故之後他沒有再做副秘書長，黨找了一名曾任黨團的成員接任，他並獲時任副主席賴仁彪委派接任執委會政策倡議一職，由黨員於大會投票通過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問他為何沒有拒絕，問他不是覺得執委會是橡皮圖章嗎？鄭解釋，「因為我要打算喺未來參選（2020年）立法會，我需要得到黨嘅支持」，亦望得到黨支持。李續問，即在2018年，鄭已望參選兩年後的立法會選舉？鄭答「有咁嘅意思」，因他2016年立會選舉時已排在港島陳淑莊名單的第二位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱倡議不獲公民黨接納-2020年12月退黨&quot;&gt;鄭稱倡議不獲公民黨接納 2020年12月退黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭確認，於2018至2020年在執委會任政策倡議，負責做研究再提出政策倡議，包括曾倡議設立發言人制度及成立獨立的網媒部門，但無一被接納。潘熙問他有否公開表示不滿，鄭指「去到我退黨嗰一刻有」，即2020年12月15日，他透過臉書個人專頁發布一則帖文。庭上展示該帖文，鄭達鴻並讀出相關段落：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「決心選入黨執委，期望可以帶入改變。這些年來，曾有前輩對我說，『阿達你就係黨嘅下一代』。就為著這句說話，哪怕並不討好，我一直努力就黨務發表意見。知識不足，我半工讀到實習大律師資格。經驗不夠，我從地區開始在北角選區議員。然而成為區議員後，即使曾為副秘書長，無論內事如改革青年部，創意媒體部，發言人制度，涉足秘書處事務等，外事如提議私人檢控，去留的條件問題等，慚愧地我改變不了任何一件事。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第67天。鄭達鴻繼續作供，表示公民黨2020年3月曾舉行立會選舉籌備會議，譚文豪稱坊間有人提出以否決預算案為爭取五大訴求的籌碼，「與其遲早都畀人夾，不如自己衝出嚟去得盡啲」，遂提議否決所有議案，並獲楊岳橋贊成。鄭指當時表達反對，稱該黨支持者為「理性中產」，「有乜理由衝出嚟，分一塊本土派嘅餅」，惟二人「一意孤行」，最終仍決定於3月25日召記者會表明否決所有政府議案。法官一度問公民黨是否與其「畀人夾」，寧願先「夾人哋」，鄭指譚意思是若站在該位置就「點都唔驚畀人夾」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭續指，會議上公民黨無就否決議案形成「統一立場」，而記者會無經執委會同意、其他黨員不知情，理解會上看法對黨員無約束力。鄭又指雖然他有出席記者會，但不同意楊岳橋和譚文豪的說法；並稱該黨設「議員豁免跟隨黨立場投票機制」，容許黨員申請豁免跟隨黨立場投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻楊岳橋譚文豪曾問參選立會意向-着攞啲成績出嚟&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻：楊岳橋、譚文豪曾問參選立會意向 着「攞啲成績出嚟」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前公民黨區議員鄭達鴻今早出庭作供，講述入黨後的工作，又指公民黨黨團凌駕執委會，不會形容為民主。辯方資深大律師潘熙其後就鄭參選立法會發問，鄭解釋參選港島是因自己是港島區議員，而2016年立會選舉亦排在港島區陳淑莊名單之後，後陳因涉案未能連任，他更打算參選該區。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭續指，2019年10月楊岳橋與譚文豪曾叫他上立法會，問他有否參選意向，並指如要他們支持「就要攞啲成績出嚟畀佢哋睇」。鄭指二人沒指明是什麼成績，他遂稱可留意2019年區議會選舉中他個人、助理及其他盟友的表現。鄭指他們最終扭轉北角炮台山區形勢，於7席取得6席，而楊和譚後於2020年1月再與他會面，「算係認可我嘅成績」，但稱尚要看其他表現，惟無指明是什麼，鄭遂「繼續努力」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻稱2020年5月獲會員大會通過參選立會&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻稱2020年5月獲會員大會通過參選立會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻續解釋，黨內有兩個程序供黨員出選，傳統程序為先由地區支部提名通過，執委會做背景審查和提名通過，再於特別會員大會讓全體黨員通過；另一程序則為「徵召機制」，由黨內立法會議員和元老如余若薇、梁家傑，就政治形勢在選前任何時間徵召黨員出選一個位置。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭確認他當時循傳統程序出選，於2020年先獲港島支部提名，4月尾5月頭獲執委通過，並於5月30日在特別會員大會通過初步公民黨參選名單，確定會派他出選。法官李運騰一度指，同年3月25日已舉行公民黨記者會，鄭達鴻和李予信有出席，似乎他們當時已獲黨支持參選，辯方稱之後會處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱黨內另設徵召機制-參與初選前仍擔憂未能代表公民黨出選&quot;&gt;鄭稱黨內另設「徵召機制」 參與初選前仍擔憂未能代表公民黨出選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭續同意，雖然會員大會通過參選名單，但在「徵召機制」下可再作更改。他指獲通過參選後曾擔心無法出選，因他作為新人，而過去港島區均有公民黨議員且該區議席「十分重要」，加上當時公民黨面對很大壓力、形勢較緊張，故有消息稱參選名單可能更改，或由郭榮鏗或梁家傑取代他出選。鄭指該擔心至他同年6月中正式宣布參與初選才停止；但在法官追問下，指當時黨內元老無直接表示或取代他參選，僅關心其選情，他亦沒主動問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問若郭榮鏗不參選法律界，會由誰參選，又笑指以往除了吳靄儀外，一直都是由郭榮鏗出任法律界議員。鄭指他不清楚，只知道後來郭被DQ時要周圍找黨內黨外人士參選，而郭的助理、事務律師 Janet Pang 或為人選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zmw0PNR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱屬取態溫和新人民調顯示只支持參與初選者-參加初選才有勝算&quot;&gt;鄭稱屬取態溫和新人、民調顯示只支持參與初選者 參加初選才有勝算&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後就整個初選的過程發問。被問為何參與初選，鄭稱因當時坊間已有初選的概念，亦有民調指民主派支持者只會支持勝出初選者；加上他當時是公民黨和民主黨兩大黨唯一並非爭取連任的新人，取態亦較溫和，故要靠黨參加初選才有勝算。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭在法官追問下，指該民調並非「三投三不投」、應由香港民意研究所進行，但不記得確實時間，而他於3月25日記者會已決定參與初選。陳慶偉一度質疑，區諾軒作供時從沒提過相關民調，問是否真的有這個民調，鄭重申有，只是不記得何時。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱直至收到區諾軒口供-始知區和戴耀廷曾與公民黨會面&quot;&gt;鄭稱直至收到區諾軒口供 始知區和戴耀廷曾與公民黨會面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續引述區諾軒供稱，曾於2020年2月與戴耀廷、李永達、李卓人一起與梁家傑會面，並於同年3月與戴在公民黨總部，與公民黨執委會會面商討初選。鄭達鴻指他雖然是執委，但不知道上述兩次會面，只是於2021年9月收到本案文件後，才在區諾軒的口供中得悉。陳慶偉追問為何他被隱瞞，鄭表示「唔清楚」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭指譚文豪稱遲早都畀人夾故提議否決所有議案-官是否想夾人哋先&quot;&gt;鄭指譚文豪稱「遲早都畀人夾」故提議否決所有議案 官：是否想夾人哋先？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;公民黨同年3月25日舉行記者會，時任黨魁楊岳橋承諾若政府不回應五大訴求，會否決所有政府議案及預算案致特首下台。鄭表示召開記招的決定是於3月中一個2020年立法會選舉籌備會議作出，稱當初應是譚文豪提出要舉行籌備會議，指「有好重要嘅事」想和大家溝通，鄭亦受邀出席。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 譚文豪（左上）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭表示，會議出席者包括黨內立法會議員及助理，其中楊岳橋及譚文豪親自出席，而郭榮鏗、郭家麒及不會連任的陳淑莊則派助理出席；會上另有潛在候選人，即他和林瑞華，其中他打算參選港島區，且據他所知只有他對該區有興趣，林則打算參選飲食界，但忘記李予信有否出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭指譚文豪於會上稱，知悉坊間有些人開始用否決財政預算案作為籌碼，以爭取五大訴求，「與其遲早都畀人夾，不如自己衝出嚟去得盡啲，用否決所有議案作為籌碼，爭取五大訴求」，林卓廷聞言說「嘩」。陳慶偉遂問：「與其『畀人夾」，公民黨是否想先『夾人哋』？（“Instead of being pressurised、畀人夾，the Civic Party wants to 夾人哋 first, right?”）」多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭指當時譚的意思是「佢企咗咁嘅立場嘅時候，就點都唔驚畀人夾啦」，旁聽席再傳來笑聲。陳追問，鄭是指公民黨被逼至牆角，較為可取的做法是反擊？又指這與該黨原意完全不同，是由被施壓一方轉為向他人施壓（from being forced, to being the one who initiates more force）。鄭澄清指當時「冇話係要夾返人哋，但係佢嘅意思係如果企咗喺呢個位置，就點都唔會再畀人夾」，但他不清楚為何譚文豪有此擔心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱自己林瑞華及郭家麒助理曾反對否決財案-曾着譚文豪等唔好去到咁盡&quot;&gt;鄭稱自己、林瑞華及郭家麒助理曾反對否決財案 曾着譚文豪等「唔好去到咁盡」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過陳慶偉卻指，鄭達鴻的說法與區諾軒證供有別，指區曾稱會面時陳淑莊反對否決財政預算案，因對功能組別感到擔心，最後公民黨亦無作任何承諾。鄭續解釋，當譚文豪提出要否決所有議案後，雖然楊岳橋及譚文豪助理同意，但亦有人反對，當中包括鄭自己、林瑞華及郭家麒助理。陳仲衡問鄭有沒有表達，鄭指有並分為3個階段——首先在譚文豪開始發言時，鄭表示「明明我哋嘅支持者係一班理性中產，有乜理由衝出嚟，分一塊係本土派嘅餅」。鄒家成聞言以口型說「哇」並微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/znhLCpy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
▲ 郭家麒（左）、譚文豪（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭續說，其後郭家麒助理談及大嶼山醫院的議題，鄭亦表示自己曾在東區區議會提出擴建東區醫院，即將洗衣房遷往大嶼山綜合大樓，並用該地作醫院第二期擴建。鄭指自己作為動議人和規劃工程及房屋事務委員會主席，且「極罕有地得到醫管局同埋政府部門嘅同意」，但若他最後在立法會反對相關議案的話「咁樣講唔過去」。鄭並指，最後是當楊岳橋及譚文豪「一意孤行」的時候，曾提醒他們「可唔可以唔好去到咁盡」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於同樣反對的林瑞華，鄭指他會上提出很注重業界利益，如果是有關抗疫基金的撥款「佢冇可能反對」。而郭家麒的助理亦表示，如果是有關大嶼山醫院的撥款，他們不可以反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱公民黨無就否決財案有統一立場-記者會未經執委會批准對成員無約束力&quot;&gt;鄭稱公民黨無就否決財案有統一立場 記者會未經執委會批准、對成員無約束力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻續稱，楊岳橋及譚文豪最後在他人反對下，仍決定繼續召開3月25日的記者會；而會議上沒有就否決預算案和所有政府議案形成公民黨的「統一立場」，沒決定誰會出席3月25日的記招，會議前黨內亦沒有就否決預算案作過任何討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Fy16r6g.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年3月25日公民黨記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰關注，黨內有程序需要跟從，不論執委會是否「橡皮圖章」，黨的決定也需要先經執委會通過。鄭表示召開記者會的決定沒有經過執委會批准，陳仲衡即問，鄭認為出席未經批准的記者會是沒有問題？鄭指「程序上有問題」，但過往很多記者會都沒有經執委會同意。陳仲衡兩度指即使如此，鄭達鴻仍出席了記者會，鄭確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，會議上有否提過公民黨部分成員在記者會上表達的立場，會對個別成員有約束力？鄭指沒有，並指據其理解，記者會表達的看法對個別黨員無約束力，因當時各議員發言不同，「講緊唔同嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱除出席籌備會議者-其他黨員對3月記招不知情-會上無發言僅舉牌&quot;&gt;鄭稱除出席籌備會議者 其他黨員對3月記招不知情 會上無發言僅舉牌&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭後在李運騰詢問下確認，該籌備會議大約在3月25日記者會前約一星期至10日舉行，但期間黨內沒有就會議的決定、即舉行記者會的事宜作任何公告或諮詢。李運騰提高聲線略驚訝問，即除了出席籌備會議的人，其他黨員對此並不知情（in the dark）？鄭答「係」，並指不清楚當時黨團有否討論過該記者會，但籌備會議上黨團內每個議辦都有派人出席；不過有部分執委則沒有出席，亦對記者會不知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問既然如此，為何鄭又會出席該記招。鄭表示他由楊岳橋邀請，以區議員和潛在立法會選舉候選人身分出席，但楊沒告知他為何要出席。庭上展示記者會相片，鄭確認除時任立法會議員楊岳橋、譚文豪、郭家麒、郭榮鏗，還包括有意參選九龍西的余德寶、有意參選超區的黃文萱、有意參選飲食界的林瑞華、和有機會與楊岳橋參選同一名單的梁嘉善。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭表示，他不清楚誰決定誰可出席記者會，自己會上亦沒有發言，其角色「就係好似相咁樣舉牌」，牌上載有選民登記的二維碼。鄭重申，以他理解會上發言者就否決預算案「沒有統一立場」，潘熙問有哪位講者的說法他不同意，鄭答：「楊岳橋同埋譚文豪嘅說話。」辯方遂展示記者會錄音謄本，惟法官陳仲衡提議播片，案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭稱公民黨設議員豁免跟隨黨立場機制-郭榮鏗曾使用&quot;&gt;鄭稱公民黨設議員豁免跟隨黨立場機制 郭榮鏗曾使用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，鄭達鴻今提及黨內有「議員豁免跟隨黨立場投票機制」，以解決執委會和黨團的分歧。鄭指該機制由2016年執委會參考英國和愛爾蘭的「良心投票機制（conscientious voting）」而設，緣於時任公民黨議員毛孟靜因就許多議題的立場與黨不同而選擇退黨，當時黨「唔想純粹因為立場唔同，就令到一個立法會議員退黨」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭指該機制由議員向黨團提出豁免，並由黨團同意，例子包括2020年6月中，郭榮鏗就張舉能法官任命首席法官的議案使用此機制。翻查資料，郭當時投贊成票，其他公民黨員則投棄權票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian forces have launched their long-anticipated offensive in an attempt to break through Russian defence lines to liberate the occupied territories. Ukrainian troops have broken through initial fighting positions along a broad part of the front, but remain some distance from Russia’s main defence line. Kyiv has yet to commit the bulk of its forces as its lead elements try to set the conditions for a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fighting so far has been tough. Russia’s initial fighting positions constituted fox holes and hand-dug trenches, but behind these were complex minefields of anti-tank and antipersonnel mines, covered by Russian UAVs and artillery. The main defence line, still 15–20 km from Ukrainian positions, has properly dug trenches and concrete-reinforced firing posts, tank obstacles, ground-laid cable to coordinate artillery strikes, and even more mines. Behind that are the reserve fighting positions of the third defence line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fighting will likely get tougher. As Ukrainian forces penetrate deeper into the defences, they will come into range of more Russian artillery firing posts. Moreover, their own artillery will be able to deliver fewer counterbattery missions, and the Ukrainian lines of advance will become more predictable, as they must follow the breaches identified in the minefields. As Ukrainian troops push forwards, they will also be covered by fewer air defences, and will likely come under greater attack by the Russian Aerospace Forces and aviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these threats, the Ukrainian military is currently trying to achieve three things. Firstly, there is an intense counterbattery duel being fought, with both sides trying to strike each other’s logistics, command and control, reconnaissance, and artillery systems. The Russians are hunting for Ukraine’s artillery with Lancet UAVs. The Ukrainians are utilising Storm Shadow and GMLRS to try to destroy Russian command and control and munitions stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the Ukrainians are trying to get the Russians to commit their reserves, moving troops from the third defence line to bolster sectors under pressure. Once these troops are pulled forwards, it will become easier to identify the weak points in the Russian lines, where a breakthrough will not be met by a new screen of repositioned forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Success is binary, not linear. The line is either broken or it is not, and Kyiv must shape the battlefield to maximise the probability of a breach&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the Ukrainian military is trying to put pressure across the front to advance through the first line of defences in as much breadth as possible. The reason for this is to increase the options for attacking the main defence line and to keep Russian forces uncertain as to where the main effort will be launched. Furthermore, with such a long front, stretching out Russian troops limits their ability to stack units in depth, pulling more forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, the Ukrainians will have to decide where to commit their main assault units, and the offensive will enter its decisive phase. This decision must be conditions-based. It isn’t about adhering to some fixed timeline. When these units are committed, the offensive will either achieve a breakthrough or fail. Success is binary, not linear. The line is either broken or it is not, and Kyiv must shape the battlefield to maximise the probability of a breach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of a success will be determined by how much progress is made on the other side of the breach. If a breach can be achieved, then the critical question will be how many units Ukraine has in reserve to surge forward and exploit the success. If operations are currently methodical, once a breach in the line occurs, speed will be of the essence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uncertain variable in the current offensive is Russian morale. Russian units are currently fighting from prepared positions and their command-and-control infrastructure is mostly intact, though some key command posts have been struck. If Russian units can be forced to reposition, however, the poor training and discipline of Moscow’s forces could see the defence become uncoordinated and susceptible to collapse. Bringing about such conditions would require some significant actions by the Ukrainians to get the Russians moving, but it is possible under such conditions for the strength of the defence to crumble rapidly. Ukraine can endeavour to bring such a situation about, but it cannot be counted on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine’s international partners, the summer is likely to be deeply uncomfortable. Losses will mount and success will take time. It is vital, however, that there is no diminution in the strengthening of the training programmes allowing Ukraine to continue to generate combat units, or the mobilisation of defence industry to put supply to the Ukrainian military on a sustainable basis. However much territory is liberated in this offensive, the critical variable is convincing the Kremlin that even if its defeat comes in stages, it is coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今踏入審訊第66天，展開辯方案情。吳政亨選擇不作供，辯方傳召3名證人，以將吳的電郵和錄音呈堂。庭上播放吳政亨受訪錄音，吳曾稱發起「三投三不投」聯署是望團結民主陣營，令初選順利，而如在「攬炒書」（指「墨落無悔」聲明書）和初選之間只能擇其一，會寧願「初選成事先」，指「我哋光復咗議會先，其他細節可以再傾」。而代表吳的律師則供稱，曾按吳指示擷取「李伯盧」（吳政亨網名）電郵，顯示李伯盧提及望聯署就否決議案保持中立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官質疑相關錄音和電郵屬「傳聞證據」，除非涉對被告不利的招認，否則不能呈堂；並着辯方就證據呈堂性提交案例和書面陳詞，明早再作口頭陳詞。料法官明作出裁定後，鄭達鴻或作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件原定周一（12日）開展辯方案情，惟因法官陳慶偉身體不適押後至周三（14日）。陳慶偉和陳仲衡今戴口罩步入法庭，李運騰則沒有戴口罩，延伸庭有被告稱：「噢！」。另岑敖暉於上周日（11日）渡過30歲生日，有旁聽人士向他稱：「生日快樂！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律師樓文員就李伯盧電郵作供-李稱望三投三不投就否決議案中立&quot;&gt;律師樓文員就「李伯盧」電郵作供 李稱望「三投三不投」就否決議案中立&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘表示，向吳政亨解釋過其權利後，吳決定不作供，並會傳召3名辯方證人，包括吳的代表事務律師陳奕勤，陳的下屬、律師樓文員韋均曉，以及曾任《蘋果日報》記者的李俊杰。前兩者涉吳政亨的 Gmail 帳戶電郵內容，李俊杰則涉訪問錄音內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;謝延豐律師行的法律文員韋均曉供稱，今年5月31日獲陳奕勤指示，登入名為「李伯盧」、電郵地址為「leebaklou@gmail.com」的帳戶，於「已發送」版面擷取2020年4月9日、題為「一點意見分享」的4封電郵內容，該電郵由「Anthony Yau」發出，「李伯盧」回應，韋並將電郵截圖燒錄成光碟。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上顯示，Anthony Yau 就「三投三不投」和初選提出意見，認為泛民須承諾當選後否決所有議案，而李伯盧則回應「希望聯署在這議題上保持中立」，又指35+其中一個用處是在2022年「奪取特首之位，讓泛黃真正執政」，但「這並不代表我個人支持或反對泛黃議員聯合否決任何議案，我只希望帶出，無論支持或反對，其實都可以有合理的原因」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方欲將電郵呈堂-法官質疑屬傳聞證據及與案不相關&quot;&gt;辯方欲將電郵呈堂 法官質疑屬傳聞證據及與案不相關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘欲將相關電郵呈堂，惟法官李運騰質疑欠缺基礎，指雖然知道吳政亨網名為「李伯盧」，但辯方須證吳為該帳戶持有人才能將電郵呈堂，否則屬「傳聞證據（hearsay evidence）」，又指「我也可以開設『李伯盧』的帳戶，但不代表我是第五被告（吳政亨）」，並強調即使並非傳聞證據，也需與案相關才能呈堂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉又問，假設該些電郵可呈堂，辯方最終希望以此作出什麼陳詞？石回應由於控方依賴吳在案發前的言行指證他，故吳案發時的所有言行能完整反映其思想狀態（state of mind）。惟法官陳仲衡指，共謀者之間的討論，不一定與外人（outsider）的討論一樣，就如吳政亨與 Anthony Yau 的討論，與吳和戴耀廷的也可能不同。李運騰亦笑着舉例，若A曾向他人聲稱與X友好，但其後被控謀殺X，又能否將A事前聲稱與X友好的證據呈堂？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰又指，辯方現時依賴吳與一名法庭甚至不知道存在的「Anthony Yau」於完全不同場合的對話，質疑沒有基礎呈堂；又指法庭開放被游說，但辯方做法須穩妥，問辯方有否相關案例。此時吳站起要求向律師發指示，陳慶偉下令休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律師稱本年5月獲吳政亨告知電郵帳戶密碼&quot;&gt;律師稱本年5月獲吳政亨告知電郵帳戶密碼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早休後，辯方將該些電郵列為臨時證物。控方其後進行盤問，韋指她獲告知吳政亨是該帳戶持有人，但對此沒個人認知，亦不知道「Anthony Yau」是否存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後傳召陳奕勤作供，陳確認處理案件期間獲吳告知「leebaklou@gmail.com」為他的電郵，吳將密碼交給他並指示他登入帳戶找尋電郵，他遂向韋均曉發指示。陳不記得吳指示他的確實日子，「但可以話係燒碟嗰日（今年5月31日）嘅前一兩日之內」，他不知道李伯盧和「Anthony Yau」還有否其他對話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方呈吳政亨2020年6月專訪-由時任蘋果日報記者撰寫&quot;&gt;辯方呈吳政亨2020年6月專訪 由時任《蘋果日報》記者撰寫&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後傳召李俊杰作供。他供稱2019至2021年於《蘋果日報》任中國組記者，並與中學同學 Jojo Chan 於2020年6月17日與「李伯盧」做訪問。二人6月27日以「祖神」筆名，在 Facebook 群組「良心經濟圈認證中心（絕無內容農場）」發布題為〈【本谷專訪】以公民之名 初選的民間推手——李伯盧（更新版）〉的文章，並由「街頭議會」專頁轉載。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李供稱，因二人對當時社會運動有些關注，而民間就初選有贊成和反對的不同聲音，故 Jojo 提議就此一起「寫吓嘢」。李運騰一度問是否需要知道這些細節，辯方指望提供寫文章的背景。李續確認，當時並不知道「李伯盧」真名是吳政亨，並確認當日是與庭上的吳政亨做訪問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨受訪稱若初選及墨落無悔擇其一-寧願初選先成事&quot;&gt;吳政亨受訪稱若初選及「墨落無悔」擇其一 寧願初選先成事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李俊杰確認訪問時曾在吳政亨知悉下錄音，庭上其後播放該段約27分鐘的錄音。被問「三投三不投」的構思從何而來，吳解釋3月中戴耀廷接觸參選人商討初選，但得悉有人不願意談判、似乎很不順利，他感到「好心傷」，望找辦法令民主派合作，靠選民壓力令參與者遵循規則，令初選順利並取得35+。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問會否擔心民主黨不遵從協議，吳指理解民主黨無簽的「墨落無悔」並非關於初選落敗便不參選，而是關於取得35+後會否積極否決預算案；並指對他來說，在「攬炒書（「墨落無悔」聲明書）」和初選之間如只能選一樣，他絕對希望大家選初選，「因為有民主陣營候選人嘅議員，總好過保皇黨」，「我會寧願希望大家至少初選成事先。」吳又指，簽與不簽「墨落無悔」各有原因，「未必係真係一個背叛」，「希望大家都團結，令到我哋光復咗議會先，其他細節可以再傾。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳引攬炒巴稱議會街頭國際戰線缺一不可靠dq令國際勢力出師有名&quot;&gt;吳引「攬炒巴」稱議會、街頭、國際戰線缺一不可、靠DQ令國際勢力「出師有名」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又強調，民主陣營的團結是整個光譜所有人的共同利益，「大家團結到，係對大家都好」，「大家唔需要去懷疑35+係咪一件好事⋯⋯一定好過35-。」至於會否擔心有激進本土派對選舉懷「焦土」或「犬儒」心態，吳則引「攬炒巴」提到「議會、街頭、國際」是缺一不可的「鐵三角」，指歷史上極權國家到民主國家的歷程均可見上述「鐵三角」存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又指激進派不一定在議會否決，而是明知35+都會被DQ（取消資格），「我哋咪靠呢個DQ製造一個國際新聞，去令到國際上支持民主陣營嘅勢力出師有名囉。」吳又指，聯署定位為「民主陣營的中立團體」，雖支持初選，但不打算為任何候選人和政黨宣傳，又指有候選人主動聯絡他表示支持，但他不會公開致謝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳稱曾參與雷動計劃-形容初選屬百花齊放但要願賭服輸&quot;&gt;吳稱曾參與「雷動計劃」 形容初選屬「百花齊放」但要「願賭服輸」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又提到，曾參與雨傘革命，亦曾任「雷動計劃」義工，「幫戴耀廷教授。」被問當年計劃失敗的原因，庭上鄒家成與吳政亨對視而笑，吳承認該計劃有「唔完美」，於臨選前才做調動或迫候選人退選製造混亂，但始終是當時「退而求其次」的選擇；並指初選定比雷動計劃更好，而這次環境下辦初選的誘因確實存在，望初選能成事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又提到，初選「百花齊放」，望所有光譜候選人都可參與，「真心地希望大家都係投返畀自己最鍾意嗰個人」；惟強調初選的「百花齊放」出現完後，「大家就願賭服輸啦」，在之後的大選就要集中票源。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李俊杰表示訪問前有告訴吳政亨訪問目的及或發布文章&quot;&gt;李俊杰表示訪問前有告訴吳政亨訪問目的及或發布文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;錄音播畢後，李俊杰確認訪問前有告訴吳訪問目的及文章有機會發布在什麼平台。李運騰追問有否告知吳訪問題目，李稱他們有「skeleton（框架）」，想了解公民在初選中的角色，故當時有告訴吳將問及「三投三不投」的效果，以及他對初選有何期望；又指當日抵達街站後吳正派發傳單，二人待吳回來告訴他訪問角度及內容，並於約半小時後進行訪問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後提醒，除非屬損害被告利益（against self interest）的招認，否則一般未經宣誓的庭外陳述屬傳聞證據，不可呈堂；並問辯方是否認為上述錄音同時包含有利和不利吳政亨的證據，並着辯方午休後回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官稱傳聞證供涉被告招認方可呈堂-着辯方明就呈堂性陳詞&quot;&gt;法官稱傳聞證供涉被告招認方可呈堂 着辯方明就呈堂性陳詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;午休後，石書銘引述吳政亨於訪問稱「攬炒書」和初選之間會選初選等，問李俊杰所寫的文章是否包括該訊息。惟李運騰質疑相關性，陳仲衡亦指對辯方證人如何理解吳的說法無興趣。石書銘再問文章就「攬炒」等想傳遞什麼訊息，惟李運騰即皺眉並不耐煩問，為何要關注這名證人的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，若訪問內容並不能呈堂，李俊杰如何撰寫訪問便與案無關。他又重申，所有未經宣誓的庭外陳述、即使由被告親述都屬「傳聞證供」，一般不能呈堂，但涉被告招認則除外；而若辯方指錄音只屬「開脫罪責的陳述（exculpatory statement）」、即只對被告有利的陳述，則看不到有任何基礎可呈堂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再次問，在辯方立場，該訪問究竟是包含被告招認的混合陳述（mixed statement），抑或是為被告開脫罪責的陳述？石書銘重申只是反映吳政亨當時的思想狀態。李着辯方提供案例，以支持不屬被告招認的庭外陳述也可呈堂；陳仲衡並指，若錄音可呈堂才會考慮其內容，但強調證人如何撰寫訪問或理解吳的說法並非要考慮的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示沒有盤問，並保留質疑辯方將相關電郵和錄音呈堂的權利，石遂將錄音標為臨時證物，證人作供完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉最後要求辯方明早就證據呈堂性作口頭陳詞，並於今晚6時前提交陳詞。石書銘指或有困難，陳指「現時只是3點，你有3小時」，石稱但控方有一整晚處理。陳慶偉提高聲線說：「當然！那是事情運作的方式！（“Of course! That is how things work!”）」李運騰提議7點，石亦望有更多時間準備，陳終下令辯方須於今晚7時前提交陳詞，法庭會於下一名被告開展案情前作裁定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件於約2時50分散庭，明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

Russia, on the other hand, has shown that quantity – to use the old expression attributed to Stalin – does not have a quality all its own. While this war will end at the negotiating table, only the outcome of the military battle will get the two sides there, writes Greg Mills from Kyiv.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep in the Dorset countryside is a private UK company refurbishing 50-year-old Sea King helicopters for use by the Ukrainian defence forces. Some of these warbirds have seen service in the Falklands, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan, though they have been given a complete overhaul before heading to the Ukrainian battlefield. There they are rendering sterling service, once more, in extracting the wounded and bringing in supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This programme is a good example of how old equipment can be repurposed at minimal cost. It’s an illustration, too, of how the training of pilots and engineers must parallel any equipment offer – one that has in this case been properly implemented. The procurement of more such Sea Kings in this way can only add considerably to Ukrainian capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the programme is also an illustration of the fact that the Ukrainians are getting only as much as donors are willing to provide, rather than what will meet their immediate needs. For comparatively little extra outlay, the Sea Kings could be fitted with stand-off Brimstone missiles, rather than go into combat zones unarmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RUSI’s Nick Reynolds says that the performance of Kyiv’s armed forces to date shows that “it can win” with “consistent supply, standardisation, sufficient spare parts and maintenance and the type of equipment, including air defence and offence and electro-magnetic protection” that Ukraine needs. “We should not base our support of Ukraine on the basis of what we can give,” he says, “but rather what they need”, and nor “should we base our support for Ukraine on the result of each and every phase of this military campaign”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the downsides of integrating multiple equipment types and managing complicated logistics and training schedules for disparate types, Western equipment has been critical in turning the tide on the battlefield in Kyiv’s favour. And yet, the Ukrainians’ technical prowess has highlighted that, while equipment is necessary, without the required motivation and skills it is never going to be enough. Afghanistan serves as a painful reminder of this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the Ukrainians have, if nothing else, demonstrated their capability and capacity for success against a foe superior in numbers and once regarded as a superpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manner in which older kit has been integrated with new systems and deployed is an illustration of how motivated the Ukrainian forces are to repel the Russian invasion, and to ensure that it never happens again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable feature of this war has been the fighting ability of the Ukrainians, set against the poor performance of the Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian forces have been depleted by heavy losses. Many have been in combat for more than a year. They are not especially well-disciplined or particularly well-led; are badly equipped in key areas such as communications; and are dependent on a strictly hierarchical command-and-control structure, consequently absent the type of small unit cohesion necessary to instil fighting confidence and ability – especially under the sort of military pressure which they are about to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surge in Ukrainian capacity is not just about Western equipment, but how Kyiv’s forces have deployed it, added to it, displayed initiative (and allowed their tactical-level commanders to do so), and trained hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Ukrainians have been short of certain equipment, including modern aircraft capable of challenging fifth-generation Russian fighters and bombers like the Sukhoi Su-34 and 35, the way in which the Ukrainians have adapted civilian technologies, including meshing AI with intelligence, has given them an edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in other respects, it’s a war that looks similar to the trench combat of the First World War; the great rolling plains of Ukraine are perfect tank territory too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Without certain weapon types supplied by the West, it will be hard to push the Russians out of Ukraine altogether&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delivery of newer Western tanks such as the M1 Abrams, the Leopard II and the UK’s Challenger will make a difference, as has the deployment of long-range HIMARS and Storm Shadow missile systems capable of striking deep-set Russian supply and command-and-control bases. So too has the use of Western 155mm artillery, more sophisticated and accurate than the Soviet-era equipment previously employed by Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usefulness of this support depends on the steady supply of Western ammunition and equipment, which might not continue in certain circumstances. One threat is political – especially the US appetite for continuing support for the Ukrainian cause, which can be relied upon only so long as the Democrats remain in the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another threat lies in the incremental assistance the West has so far preferred to supply to Ukraine, presumably out of fear that Kyiv will become too powerful and risk a radical response from Moscow or a change in tack from Beijing “if Putin was cornered and humiliated”, as suggested by Gregory Nemyrin, the deputy chair of the foreign relations committee in the Ukrainian parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fear of catastrophic success is apparently founded on a belief that a cornered Putin could be very dangerous. After all, there are no prizes for second place in Russian politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without certain weapon types, it will be hard to push the Russians out of Ukraine altogether. While the Russians have proven comparatively hapless on the battlefield, it is unrealistic – and possibly foolhardy – to expect or risk their complete disintegration. It is certainly, however, a measure of the disorganisation and destruction of Russian forces that Kyiv will have to achieve to end the conflict. While the Ukrainians are short of certain weapon types, they only have to be better than the Russians – and that looks likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyiv’s aim for its much-anticipated offensive is for Ukraine to arrive at the negotiating table in a position of strength. After all, this table is where “every war ends”, says Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, “and our task is to bring Ukraine to the table in the strongest position possible”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer rate of consumption of shells in the conflict – at peak, according to Western military estimates, amounting to 20,000 daily by the Russians – represents a further threat. Given that the largest facility worldwide, in Scranton produces 11,000 per month (though there are plans to increase this to 85,000 by 2028), there is a looming deficit in NATO stocks. Already, the US has given Ukraine “more than 1.5 million rounds of 155mm ammunition” as part of Washington’s $38 billion in military assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final threat lies in the continued ability of the Ukrainians to win on the battlefield, without which Western fatigue might set in – a trait that could be compounded by any failure on Kyiv’s part to develop a narrative beyond victimhood. Everyone loves a winner, not a whinger, and war is no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative battle is ongoing, demanding considerable dedication of resources. Contending with the Russian version of the war – given Moscow’s comparative strengths of resources and news outlets including RT and Sputnik – is challenging. This demands countering disinformation, on which a Ukrainian government unit works full-time, and promoting a positive image of Ukraine based – says Myhailo Podoliak, the head of the presidential office – on “its internal core strength, its rapid transformation, sincerity, and its ability to understand and manage complexity”. In this, he notes, “leadership allows us to have a global role and to be the subject”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the Ukrainians continue to surprise and are alert to these challenges. Their ingenuity can also be seen in the refurbishment of vehicles left behind on the battlefield by the Russians. Around the eastern city of Kharkiv, for example, according to Ukrainian sources, the Russians abandoned nearly 400 armoured vehicles – now known, in Ukrainian humour and in reference to the US Second World War programme, as “Russian lend-lease”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industriousness is present in other ways. The mayor of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov, notes that some 4,000 homes in the city – Ukraine’s second largest, which lies just 30 km from the Russian border – were destroyed in the early days of the war. This has mostly been cleaned up, though the city remains under artillery and missile fire and many of its shops and offices are boarded up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true for the areas around Kyiv, notably in the suburbs of Bucha, Irpin and Borodynka. Today they are all being rebuilt, even though the bitter memories will remain – not least the massacre of 458 civilians in Bucha, later buried in a pit behind the back of the local Orthodox church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;From a Ukrainian perspective, the war has to be finished quickly, before Russia manages to get its industry behind its war effort&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eastern city of Izyum, too, has been scarred by the deaths of an estimated one thousand civilians out of an original pre-war population of 45,000. The city was liberated on 14 September. After liberation, according to the Izyum authorities, a mass grave of 440 bodies was found in the woods to the north of the town, while an estimated 80% of housing was destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, much of the town has been cleaned up. The secretary of the local municipality, Constantine Petrov, says a “horrible picture” greeted his team when they returned after the Russian retreat on 14 September. “Only a few houses on the outskirts had gas, and no-one had electricity”. We chatted in the only municipal building left standing, new windows fitted where the old ones had been blown out by the constant shellfire which characterised the fortnight-long struggle for the town in February–March last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar conditions were created in Kharkiv. The governor of the Kharkiv region, Dr Oleh Synyehubov, counts the cost at 30,000 damaged and destroyed buildings, including 8,500 private households, 4,000 multi-story complexes, 800 educational establishments, 300 hospitals and clinics, and 100 government buildings. He puts the number of dead at some 2,000 civilians, including 75 children. Dr Synyehubov estimates the cost of destruction at around $15 billion “so far”, since there are more than 20 towns in his oblast which continue to be shelled on a daily basis. He praises international benefactors who have come forward to assist, singling out Howard Buffet, who donated DNA kits to enable the identification of victims and has “rebuilt 15 bridges”. He acknowledges, however, than salvation will come from inside, stating that “peace will only come about through a strong Ukraine and a strong military”. He adds: “We have to count on our own strength, not that of international agreements”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to be fascinated by the impact of hi-tech weaponry on the battlefield, including Russian hypersonic Kinzhal (or “danger”) missiles capable of striking targets at Mach 10, and the widespread use of Iranian Shahed drones (known locally as “scooters” due to the noise they make) as a terror weapon. The police station in Izyum was hit with one such drone two days before we visited, putting the officers a bit on edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For military strategists, this war raises questions about how future armies might be structured and equipped. It stresses training, equipment, intelligence and the ability to quickly scale up in partnership with others. It also poses tough questions about the performance of the West in deterring Russia before the conflict, thus potentially avoiding it altogether. The West’s abject performance in Afghanistan would have led the Russians to believe it was weak. Deterrence was further undermined by President Joe Biden’s statement before the war that putting US troops on the ground in Ukraine was “not on the table”. By removing this card, and by not saying clearly that the US would supply Ukraine with modern equipment – as it has subsequently done – deterrence was undermined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more things change, the more they stay the same. Wars are won by stamina, skill, logistics and leadership. Ukraine has these in spades, alongside its moral advantage: it is the victim of Russian aggression, the David delivering hammer blows to the Russian Goliath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainians have excelled at organisation. The first days of the war were characterised by the chaos of refugee movements, as more than five million Ukrainian women and children fled westwards, many to camps and homes elsewhere in Central and Western Europe. There were fuel and other shortages in the first few months, but the Ukrainians quickly got organised. Visiting today – approaching 500 days into the war – Ukrainians are going about their lives despite daily Russian terror attacks on the country’s urban centres. Cities are notable for the number of men now in uniform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kharkiv, for instance, which had been reduced to 500,000 people from its pre-war population of two million, is now back to the one million mark, according to Colonel Yevhen Vasylenko of Kharkiv’s Rescue and Emergency Services. The roads to the south – leading towards Izyum and other towns – are open, though the heavy security presence reminds one of the dangers. Electricity was restored in Izyum a week after the Russian withdrawal, while heating has been restored to more than 90 apartment blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, the authorities are rapidly pursuing a stabilisation, normalisation and reconstruction agenda. In the Kharkiv oblast alone, 69,000 mines have been lifted, roads are being repaired and electricity is being restored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The counteroffensive will be won – or lost – by the ability to achieve what military strategists describe as the “combined arms effect”. This type of battle involves the close integration of artillery, air defence and offence, and well-drilled and mobile ground forces. The Ukrainians now possess the surface-to-air missile cover to keep Russian aircraft and helicopters at bay, the ability to jam crude Russian comms, offensive drone (and some jet) capability, and – with the delivery of Storm Shadow and HIMARS, among other systems – the guided missile technology to force Russian headquarters and supply dumps far to the rear. In addition, they have proven short- and longer-range foreign and local anti-tank weapons; sophisticated heavy tanks including the Leopard, Abrams and Challenger; as well as Western infantry fighting vehicles. This approach also requires the integration of engineer units to clear obstacles, including the multi-layered minefields dug by the Russians. And then the organisation has to keep the offensive going, maintaining supply lines and operational tempo – something the Russians proved incapable of doing, in part because they chose February to invade and their convoys were strung out on paved roads, becoming easy prey for Ukrainian anti-tank units and drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As David Petraeus, the retired US general, has put it, such a combined operation is “very complex … it’s a bit like a symphony. You have to have all of the different pieces play their part”. He believes the Ukrainians now have this capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever happens, from a Ukrainian perspective, the war has to be finished quickly, before Russia manages to get its industry behind its war effort. Russia has so far done an exceptional job of shoring up its economy, even though it has taken a hammering from Western sanctions. It seems now to be gearing itself up for a long war – although Putin will have to explain why even greater numbers of Russian boys are dying in this war, when the Ukrainians were supposed to have greeted them as liberators. Ukrainian estimates have the number of Russian dead at over 210,000; Western estimates suggest the overall number of casualties, including wounded, is around that number. Bakhmut alone cost the Wagner Group 17,000 dead, and perhaps as many as five times that number wounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those thinking of making peace in this neighbourhood will not only have to think of questions of international law, sovereignty, human rights, and moral legitimacy in seeking compromise, but also about putting in place the conditions that will prevent a return to conflict. As Karina, who spent the six months of Russian occupation in hiding in Izyum and who now runs a small restaurant in the town with her friend, pleads: “I just want peace, and silence”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the war ends will, critically, shape the manner of the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has been explicitly directed to contribute to UK prosperity and, since then, it has consistently emphasised that the whole of the country should benefit from defence spending. The defence industry is economically important to many areas of the UK, and defence policy must be consistent with an industrial strategy that promotes jobs and skills throughout the UK’s regions and nations. In light of these policy pledges to give defence a more regional footprint, this paper explores the extent of defence activity in Northern Ireland (NI), a region that exhibits considerable defence potential yet has benefited only marginally from defence expenditure in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper finds that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NI is a long-contested region of the UK and experienced decades of violent sectarian conflict between the late 1960s and the late 1990s. The shadow of this conflict, some local political parties’ antipathy to the defence industry and a historical trend towards unequal regional MoD spending have considerably affected the defence demographics of NI today, resulting in little work being located there. However, a series of contextual and business changes are underway involving three prominent businesses with considerable defence potential: Thales, an experienced defence-focused business unit; Harland &amp;amp; Wolff, a heavy engineering firm at the centre of the National Shipbuilding Strategy’s aim of regenerating the shipbuilding sector; and Spirit AeroSystems, a high-technology aerospace company looking to expand into the defence space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to these three larger companies, the NI defence sector comprises many small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating predominantly in the digital manufacturing and technology sectors. Despite the customer focus and agility that they add throughout the defence supply chain, these smaller companies still feel that defence is a particularly difficult market to access. They experience several difficulties, some largely common to small firms across the country and others peculiar to the NI context.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another key industrial asset in NI is its civilian aerospace legacy. The relevance of this sector is enhanced by the growing inter-relationships between the civil and military sectors. In an era where information capture and analysis are central to defence capability, surveillance and communications systems are often deployed on and in civil aircraft. In the uncrewed air systems domain, such systems are increasingly used for civil and military purposes. Thus, NI suppliers with certified qualities should explore and be considered for work in both the defence and civil sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to a strong civilian aerospace pedigree in the region, defence can also leverage NI’s vibrant cyber security sector. In the years since the Good Friday Agreement, NI has become a hotspot for cyber-security innovation, with cities such as Belfast and Derry/Londonderry exhibiting high technology specialists and consistently attracting domestic as well as overseas investment. Through its cyber-security clusters and academic centres of excellence, NI has developed beyond the average UK science and technology capabilities, nurtured science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills and established leading R&amp;amp;D programmes. These activities are the basis for generating military and security capabilities and other tangible and intangible assets, which are themselves levers of national power and influence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, NI exhibits considerable defence potential, with three prominent businesses at the top of the supply chain that can, together with the extensive range of SMEs in the region, create an opportunity to promote NI, not as part of the problem set of UK defence and security, but as a valued contributor to its management and solution. The MoD should be monitoring the situation and looking for further opportunities to support local stakeholders, as the current UK government ambition that the whole of the UK should benefit from defence activity is clearly not being met. This should be a particular concern of those in the MoD focused on prosperity and also be in the consciousness of all involved with defence spending with the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a growing interest in the place of defence, especially the defence industry, in the UK economy. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has been directed to contribute to national prosperity since the 2015 National Security Review. A study on defence in the economy by former defence procurement minister Philip Dunne was published in 2018. Recognised data limits in turn prompted the creation of the Joint Economic Data Hub (JEDHub) within the Defence Solutions Centre, whose initial report was published in 2022. The government’s 2021 Defence and Security Industrial Strategy (DSIS) included economic considerations among a range of wider factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has long been awareness of regional variations in the economic impact of defence work, but a parliamentary exchange in 2020 between Dunne and Secretary of State for Defence Ben Wallace made clear that the government is aware of local and regional considerations and aspires to see benefits for the whole of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ben Wallace): The MOD makes procurement decisions based on security, capability requirement, cost, supply chain and other social value considerations and will continue to do so. The November 2020 changes to the Green Book will ensure that there is an increased focus on setting clear objectives and consideration of location-based impacts. MOD footprint and spend is widely distributed across the UK and future procurement will continue to reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the end-of-year rules were not changed, the recent £24.1 billion multi-year settlement with the Treasury will now allow the MOD to invest in next generation military capability across the whole United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Parliament, the Scottish Affairs Committee has devoted extended attention to defence in Scotland, but there has been little systematic information about the defence industry in Northern Ireland (NI), a gap that this paper seeks to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aims-and-objectives&quot;&gt;Aims and Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the main challenges related to conducting defence business in NI as well as the key players in the region’s defence industrial landscape. It explores this landscape with a focus on three objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To collect, digest and explain information on the current position regarding spending on defence industry in NI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To assess the ambition and potential of businesses in NI to do more in and for the defence sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To generate suggestions for government action to facilitate the ambition that the whole of the UK should benefit from the defence budget.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper focuses primarily on the defence sector and on traditional defence players in NI. The security industry in NI is diversified, offering products and services to numerous government departments and organisations, as well as a broad spectrum of clients in the private sector. In contrast, the MoD is frequently the only buyer of specialised defence goods. Although it has thousands of suppliers for a wide range of products and services, many of which are not naturally associated with military capability, it typically purchases defence equipment from a limited number of much larger prime contractors who are able to handle the complex financial, technological and engineering requirements of delivering highly complex systems. These suppliers are the focus of this research. Government policy shapes the UK defence industry’s market much more than that of the security industry. Due to the MoD’s special relationship and ability to shape the market, this paper primarily focuses on the defence sector in NI and on the activities of Tier 1 and 2 suppliers therein. The extent and importance of the security sector in NI, and particularly cyber, is nonetheless addressed in Chapter IV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper included a targeted review of academic literature on regional defence spending, as well as of grey literature (for example, reports from industry associations, defence company websites, UK government websites, innovation organisations and independent research organisations) in order to provide a considered, well-referenced analysis. The researchers also spent a week in NI speaking to industry associations, and industry prime and lower-tier suppliers. “Lower tier” refers to mid-tier, mid-sized and small SMEs – that is, non-prime defence contractors. Interviewees within these companies were selected on the basis of their knowledge of the topic, with a snowball sampling drawing from a network of defence companies in the region provided by Aerospace, Defence, Security &amp;amp; Space (ADS), a UK-wide industrial association. A list of the organisations and stakeholders whose insights have informed this research are in the Annex. Where possible, interview data was triangulated with open source references. The identities of those providing information and the organisations they work for have been kept confidential to facilitate their ability to speak freely, with exceptions related to those who explicitly agreed to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-defence-procurement-and-the-levelling-up-agenda&quot;&gt;I. Defence Procurement and the Levelling-Up Agenda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipping the armed forces to deliver their outputs is one of the most critical, demanding and complex tasks faced by the UK government. The procurement of military equipment has never been a simple matter of seeking to buy the “best kit” for the military, as defence procurement can be an important factor in a nation’s economic strength, making contributions beyond the pure military instrument. Defence spending often plays a key role in anchoring regional economies, including providing opportunities to communities in otherwise economically deprived areas by, for instance, promoting employment and the development of specialist knowledge, skills and expertise, or by promoting regional investment opportunities through defence-related exports. As such, procurement decisions can have ramifications for the dynamism of regional ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2015 and even before, the UK government has sought to include many of these considerations in explicit policy frameworks such as sector strategies, most prominently the DSIS. Since 2015, the MoD has been centrally directed to use its funding, in part, to promote national prosperity. Dunne’s report in 2018 argued that procurement decisions should not rest on cost alone, and that consideration should also be given to the prosperity impact on local economies when making procurement decisions. The Defence in a Competitive Age 2021 paper stressed how defence benefited the whole of the UK, including employment, publishing numbers that aggregated the benefits in Scotland, Wales and NI. The DSIS further reinforced the multiple benefits linked to defence procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the government aims to use defence procurement for the pursuit of multiple objectives that were well summarised in the Land Industrial Strategy published in 2022 (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2XyTQQ6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic impact of defence spending can be negative when expenditure is excessive, but it clearly generates employment and can involve the generation of skills for the civil economy. Defence spending on R&amp;amp;D can yield technologies that are valuable in both the military and civil sectors. And a not-trivial consideration is the significant proportion of defence funds spent in country that are returned to the Treasury in the form of income and other taxes. Long-term defence projects also encourage participating firms to invest in manufacturing facilities that can then have civil uses. In 2023, very few of these benefits apply in NI, a situation that this paper attempts to analyse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-the-defence-business-in-northern-ireland-background&quot;&gt;II. The Defence Business in Northern Ireland: Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter discusses the macroeconomic situation in NI and reasons for the limited defence spending in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-background-and-ni-defence-share&quot;&gt;Economic Background and NI Defence Share&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across a broad range of economic and social metrics, geographic differences in the UK are large in absolute terms and have widened over recent decades. NI is a region of just over 1.9 million people, and accounts for 2.8% of the UK’s population. It was once well known for shipbuilding and the linen industry, but these industries have experienced a severe decline. NI is the poorest performing UK region for productivity, almost 20% below the UK level, and is falling behind, with a lower level of productivity growth relative to the UK average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirroring these disparities, the UK defence sector has historically been characterised as exhibiting a north–south divide, with southern regions of the UK receiving the major share of defence expenditure and employment. This trend continues, and throughout the 21st century NI has benefited minimally from defence spending. According to the Office for National Statistics, total annual MoD expenditure with UK industry was just over £21 billion in 2021/22, with NI receiving 0.5% of the total (see Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of MoD spending per head in a region, the NI figure for the year 2021/22 was £60, while the national average was £310 (see Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tTMXzPC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a population of over 1.9 million, the latest (2023) report by the MoD’s JEDHub shows that Northern Ireland accounted for 0.8% of national defence private sector employment. A report by the MoD in 2022 showed that in terms of direct defence-related employment, in 2020/21, for every 100,000 people in full-time employment in NI, just 60 of these jobs were UK defence related. The equivalent number for Scotland was 640 and for the southwest of England it was 2,060. The January 2023 edition of the same government report did not include the figures on this topic. While recent new streams of work for Thales and Harland &amp;amp; Wolff for missiles and Fleet Solid Support ships work are likely to boost direct employment associated with MoD spending, the figures for 2019/20 show that Northern Ireland only accounted for 500 of the 125,000 jobs supported by UK defence in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reasons-for-low-ni-defence-expenditure&quot;&gt;Reasons for Low NI Defence Expenditure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons why the NI defence industry is not as vigorous as that of other regions. These include the commercial failings of past defence establishments (leaving a minimal presence of defence primes in the province), sensitivities linked to the region’s past, and a historical trend towards unequal regional MoD spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NI is a long-contested region of the UK, which experienced decades of violent sectarian conflict between the late 1960s and the late 1990s. This period, known as the Troubles, came to an end in 1998 with the creation of a power-sharing government that included political forces aligned with armed groups. As part of this settlement, known as the Good Friday Agreement, the British government committed to reducing the number and role of the armed forces deployed in NI, as well as to the removal of security installations and defence bases. Due to the extremely complex and sensitive legacy of NI’s past and the demilitarisation efforts envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement, conducting defence business in the region has not been easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These difficulties, peculiar to NI, are also exacerbated by a trend of unequal regional MoD spending. This, coupled with the shadow of 30 years of conflict as well as some local political parties’ antipathy to the defence industry, has considerably affected the defence demographics of NI, resulting in little work located there. But a series of contextual and business changes are underway, and it is on these that this paper now focuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-surveying-the-potential-of-the-ni-defence-industry&quot;&gt;III. Surveying the Potential of the NI Defence Industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter outlines the activities of key Tier 1 and 2 suppliers in NI, as well as the opportunities and challenges faced by suppliers down the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-ni-defence-industrial-players&quot;&gt;Key NI Defence Industrial Players&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NI exhibits a vibrant industrial panorama with some key companies, including the US-owned aerospace company Rockwell Collins, whose NI subsidiary is focused on making seats for commercial aircraft, and Schrader Electronics, a US-owned electronics firm. Three firms with defence potential stand out: Harland &amp;amp; Wolff (H&amp;amp;W); Thales; and Spirit AeroSystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&amp;amp;W&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2019, H&amp;amp;W in Belfast went into liquidation with 79 employees. While having had a notable and extensive history in shipbuilding, including construction of the Titanic, it had been in a sustained decline. The last vessel it built for the Royal Navy was a Leander-class frigate completed in 1968. The last ship it built was Anvil Point, a roll-on roll-off ferry under an MoD Private Finance Initiative, which was delivered in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after liquidation, the firm was bought by a strategic infrastructure company, previously known as InfraStrata plc, for the modest sum of £6 million, under which it acquired a very large infrastructure in Belfast covering 81 acres that included drydock facilities able to take the largest military ships, including the UK’s aircraft carriers. There are other docking areas and two historic Samson and Goliath cranes. In terms of buildings, there are two enormous fabrication halls that were and could again be used to build whole ships and certainly ship blocks under cover, so long as investment in manufacturing plant was available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to be impressed by the entrepreneurial spirit of the new owners who have restored the H&amp;amp;W name, invested in new capabilities and found work that could take advantage of their infrastructure. In February 2023, a large tanker was in drydock to be painted and for other repairs, a Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel was moored awaiting some attention, and one of the large halls had an installed computerised welding machine involved in the building of two dozen barges for the waste and recycling firm Cory. On occasion, large cruise ships come in for maintenance work. The workforce at the yard had grown significantly by February 2023 and there is an active recruitment programme in place, especially for apprentices. In April 2023, the firm had 65 apprentices working on site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the new ownership H&amp;amp;W has also grown by acquisition. In 2020, it bought the Appledore yard in Devon, which had been abandoned by its owner Babcock after its work on the Queen Elizabeth-class had been completed, along with an order from the Republic of Ireland for four patrol craft. When H&amp;amp;W took over Appledore in 2019 there was one employee, the site manager. In 2021, H&amp;amp;W also bought facilities on the east and west coasts of Scotland at Methil and Arnish, for which it had plans for offshore energy and defence work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H&amp;amp;W also shared in the confidence in the regeneration of the UK shipbuilding industry that was a feature of the government’s National Shipbuilding Strategy of 2017 and the refresh of that document that was published in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In autumn 2022, H&amp;amp;W was a key element of the Team Resolute consortium that was named as the preferred bidder for the £1.6-billion contract to build three Fleet Solid Support (FSS) ships. The consortium was led by Navantia of Spain, which will provide the design (supported by BMT of the UK) and do some (possibly most) of the construction. Navantia is the prime contractor with ultimate (financial) responsibility for delivery of the vessels. H&amp;amp;W will begin by building at least the bow block of the ship in Belfast and other work will take place at Appledore. Capturing and enhancing the shipbuilding expertise that was formerly at Appledore, rebuilding capability in Belfast and building a positive relationship between the Appledore and Belfast sites will be important for both those sites and the FSS programme. Final assembly of the component blocks is planned for Belfast. Some sense of the weight of the work to be done by the H&amp;amp;W group (Belfast and Appledore) can be gleaned from the £700–800-million manufacturing contract that H&amp;amp;W signed with Navantia in early 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the choice of Team Resolute to deliver the FSS indicates that the MoD sought to tick the levelling up and prosperity boxes by providing opportunities to H&amp;amp;W but, at the same time, passed financial risk to Navantia in Spain by making it the prime contractor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an uncomfortable session for the MoD, Vice Admiral Paul Marshall provided two pieces of reassurance for the Defence Committee. First, he specified how a workforce was to be generated for Belfast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The mobilisation of the workforce is absolutely a key risk for the programme; it is probably the most significant risk that I see going forwards. There is a plan, first, to recruit workers into the yards. They will then go to Spain to be trained and upskilled before returning to the UK. Then, in a “train the trainer” kind of way, Spanish shipbuilders will help to train the UK workforce in the UK yards. On reducing that further, the procurement strategy of integration in a UK yard is a significant mitigation of the risk overall: we know exactly what our obligations are in the contract when it comes to not only producing the ship but how it is ultimately integrated and brought together at Harland &amp;amp; Wolff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, he stressed that delivery of social value elements was a contractual obligation in the contract with Navantia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the threshold social value within the FSS contract is 10%—that is an obligation within the contract and it will be managed through the usual contract governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the Defence Committee expressed fears that H&amp;amp;W will be unable to acquire the skills and capability to deliver much work on the FSS, which will then result in most of the manufacturing taking place in Spain. Moreover, such a development could appear to be in Navantia’s commercial interest and seemingly limit its incentives to help out H&amp;amp;W. Another scenario is that H&amp;amp;W might generate a workforce by bringing workers from other parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The owners of H&amp;amp;W cannot be criticised for their entrepreneurial spirit and ambition but, if things do not go well, those responsible for the selection and implementation of the procurement strategy should expect to be held to account for their choices. However, should the FSS project proceed on schedule, the MoD will have made a significant contribution to turning what had become an industrial wasteland near the centre of Belfast into a hive of activity with longer-term prospects. Indeed, if H&amp;amp;W can deliver to time and budget, technology and expertise will be transferred from Spain, and the company will be well placed to win fabrication and support work on other vessels, including defence ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thales plant in Belfast has gone from relative neglect by government to near centre stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally this plant was part of Short Brothers and was focused on missiles. By 1989, Short Brothers was a government-controlled, struggling company. With the government agreeing to take over Short Brothers’ debts, Bombardier of Canada agreed to buy the business for £30 million in 1989. The business also included aircraft development and production in a separate but relatively nearby site that today is owned and operated by Spirit AeroSystems in the US (see section on Spirit AeroSystems below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1993, Bombardier formed a missile 50–50 joint venture with Thomson-CSF of France (which was subsequently renamed Thales). Next, Bombardier strategically opted out of the defence sector and sold its share of the missile joint venture to its French partner Thales in 2000. Since then, Thales has run the Belfast plant along with a final assembly unit in the NI countryside which completes the missiles with propellant and explosive elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thales Belfast has three main products: Starstreak; Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM) systems; and the Next Generation Light Anti-Armour Weapon (NLAW). Starstreak is a short-range, high-speed, ground-to-air missile system (which can also be steered to hit surface targets over three miles away) and can be fired from land or sea platforms. LMM is a lightweight, precision-strike multirole missile designed to be fired from a variety of tactical platforms on land, sea and air. LMM development began in 2008, building on technology from Starstreak. Qualification testing and initial production commenced in late 2011, following an initial contract by the MoD in April 2011, but progress was slow. It was integrated on to the Wildcat helicopter and fired from that platform in the early 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NLAW is a man-portable, anti-armour, tube-launched missile. This is a joint effort with Saab of Sweden, which produces many of the weapon’s internal components with Thales doing final assembly as well as some production work. The weapon came into service with the British Army in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While government provision was made for the assured UK production of small arms ammunition, most recently in the Next Generation Munitions Solutions contract with BAE Systems, and for the development and production of a range of complex weapons (in the Complex Weapons Portfolio with MBDA in the lead), there was no commitment between 2013 and 2020 about sustaining the UK development, production and support capabilities of the munitions produced by Thales. Instead, there were just a number of individual contracts. The last reported MoD order for new Starstreak missiles was in 2013, although Thales received availability and upgrade contracts in 2018 (£98 million) and 2021 (almost £100 million). However, Thales was successful in winning exports, particularly in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, and South Africa. Thales’ Paris headquarters gave the support, including in its move to diversify its capabilities into directed energy systems and electric power for space systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2022, Thales Belfast’s products became a vital asset for UK supplies to Ukraine. The Russian invasion of Ukraine showed once again what 21st-century conventional inter-state war could look like. It underlined the value of inexpensive weapons that could bring down helicopters and low-flying, fixed-wing aircraft (Starstreak) and anti-tank weapons (including NLAWs), which played an important role in denying Russian hopes of a quick victory. The operational value of both weapons has been reliably reported, with Wallace observing: “These next generation light anti-tank weapons have played a decisive role in supporting Ukraine’s army to drive back Russia’s illegal invading forces”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in such a war, very large numbers of these weapons are needed. As a result of UK NLAW supply to Ukraine from British stock, the UK has needed to replace and perhaps enhance its own holdings and will also likely want to send more supplies to Ukraine. In April 2022, the MoD contracted for 500 weapons to be delivered in 2023 and in December 2022 it placed a £224-million contract with Thales and Saab for many more NLAWs for delivery in two and three years’ time. Wallace said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Secured through Defence Equipment and Support – the MoD’s procurement arm – today’s agreement will see several thousand units delivered to UK Armed Forces across 2024–2026, in addition to around 500 being delivered in 2023 through a separate procurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the experience of the Ukraine war has much enhanced recognition of Thales Belfast’s strategic significance, its economic impact should not be overlooked. In 2023, the company, by now with over 600 employees, pointed out that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thales contributes £35 million to Northern Ireland’s GDP with Thales Belfast’s staff average pay in the top 10% of all employees in Northern Ireland. Thales Belfast also supports an ecosystem of suppliers and 91% of our local procurement in Northern Ireland is with small to medium enterprises (SMEs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thales Belfast’s future seems assured while the Ukraine war lasts, but thereafter much hinges on how the MoD and the Army decide to prioritise defence funds. Will they emphasise the sort of modest-cost munitions which are the focus in NI and look to build larger stocks than before, justified by deterrence arguments and the value of capabilities for sustained warfighting? Might they also look to Thales for capabilities to surge production rates in times of crisis? Will they fund work so that the munition performance can be regularly improved, enabling the company to sustain a capacity for R&amp;amp;D? What place will international collaboration play in such matters? Alternatively, will complacency be restored with peace in Ukraine and neglect of mid-range munitions return as a feature of UK defence procurement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the signs are at least promising: Thales is developing and producing its next generation multi-role missile to be mounted on UK ships, land vehicles and helicopters and in 2021, Thales Belfast was a significant part of the consortium awarded a contract to work on the development of laser weapons, which the company said would protect 140 jobs and allow the creation of 40 more. With support from Thales headquarters, Thales Belfast is also investing in space technologies, dealing particularly with electric propulsion, and has prompted the establishment of a regional special interest group of some 30 smaller companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit AeroSystems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spirit is a US-based company that was formed when Boeing sold off its factory in Wichita and its Oklahoma operations in 2005. In the US, Spirit is a major supplier of structures for the 737 and Boeing remains Spirit’s main customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things went awry in March 2019 when the latest version of this aircraft, the 737 Max, was grounded for 20 months after two crashes, and even in 2021 some doubts remained about its safety. Then in 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic virtually stopped the civil aviation business in its tracks with, at that time, no date visible for its recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments prompted Spirit to decide both to reduce its reliance on Boeing and to diversify its products to include defence. In the US, it has won work designing and producing aerostructures on militarised civil aircraft, notably the KC-46 and the P-8A, but also on the CH-53K and V-280 helicopter and tilt rotor and the B-21 bomber. It has invested in composites capable of high-temperature operations and with potential for hypersonic flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spirit bought BAE Systems’ aerostructures business in Prestwick in Scotland in 2006, and a key step in the move to a wider customer base was the purchase of Bombardier’s businesses in NI in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the core of Spirit’s work in Belfast is construction of the fuselage and other structures for Bombardier business jets and advanced composite wings for the Airbus 220. This aircraft has proved a strong commercial success, and by January 2022, there had been 680 orders and 194 deliveries, yielding an order backlog of 486.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spirit Belfast’s production of Airbus 220 wings, which are largely made from composite materials, has benefited from extensive capital investment in production machinery including autoclaves and is a large and impressive facility. The factory uses a Spirit-owned resin injection technique which supports the creation of complex one-piece, highly loaded structures. These technologies have potential for wider defence applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spirit’s aim to become a defence supplier also to the UK had initial success when in 2021, it led a team including Northrop Grumman UK and Callen–Lenz, a small UK UAV firm, in winning a £30-million MoD contract to design and produce a prototype of the Spirit-led Mosquito project, the envisaged Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft, a “loyal wingman” system which would serve as an uncrewed platform to work with the planned Tempest manned aircraft. A first flight was envisaged by the government for 2023. However, the government ended the project at the design stage, having concluded that “more beneficial capability and cost-effectiveness appears achievable through exploration of smaller, less costly, but still highly capable additive capabilities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Spirit’s UK defence ambitions have not been abandoned and its interest in uncrewed aircraft remains very positive. Reflecting its commitment, it has seconded staff to the Defence Solutions Centre and joined the club of companies associated with the Future Combat Air System, the Tempest-plus concept which includes adjunct platforms. Spirit, with its composites expertise in defence missionised structures (such as SAAB GlobalEye), is also a member of the Airbus-led team bidding for the New Medium Helicopter, a replacement for the Puma and other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, the Spirit AeroSystems company has extensive engineering expertise focused on composites but not restricted to them. Where appropriate, and subject to the International Traffic in Armaments Regulations (ITAR) and government-to-government discussions, transfer of such capabilities to the UK may be possible. Obviously, the US export control machinery covering dual-use goods and the ITAR will need to be carefully navigated, but in general, that regulatory system does not cover the management expertise that a company can bring to its subsidiaries. Also, the company has a set of growth aspirations around their defence and space strategies for unmanned, next-generation aircraft, effects, space and hypersonics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spirit’s interest in uncrewed air systems (UAS) remains strong and the role played by such vehicles in the Ukraine war has been striking. A large variety of UAS have been and are being developed for multiple functions and the potential for strong, lightweight and affordable composite structures in this domain is apparent. Composites might also be associated with low-maintenance stealth features in future air systems. As can be seen in the Ukraine conflict, UAS are prompting multiple efforts in counter-drone technologies and systems which threaten to reduce the viability of many of the simpler UAS on the market. A “drone–counter drone” competition is underway. It is in their capacity to navigate through these long-term issues that larger companies such as Spirit have an advantage over smaller firms that are focused on specific platforms that can be generated relatively quickly but whose utility may be of short duration. The target should be to link small-firm agility with the resources and wider perspective of larger businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;an-sme-dominated-economy&quot;&gt;An SME-Dominated Economy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NI is marked by the predominance of small businesses with no easy geographic links with major defence or other large manufacturing entities outside the region. The latest NI business activity, size, location and ownership statistics, released by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency for 2022, show that NI remains “predominantly a micro-business economy, with almost 90% of businesses having less than 10 employees. Just over one-quarter of businesses in NI had turnover of less than £50,000, whilst 70% had turnover of less than £250,000”. These are similar to the ratios found in the UK economy as a whole, but what makes NI unusual is the relative absence of large manufacturing companies to serve as SME customers and the recent growth in SMEs sufficiently interested in the defence and security sector to have joined ADS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CdscwV3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Percentage of Businesses Operating in NI by Employee Size Bands, 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: The majority of businesses (89%, 70,510) in NI were micro-businesses (fewer than 10 employees). Just over 2% (1,640) of businesses had 50 or more employees. Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nisra.gov.uk/system/files/statistics/IDBR-Publication-2022_0.pdf&quot;&gt;Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, “Northern Ireland Business; Activity, Size, Location and Ownership, 2022”&lt;/a&gt;, p. 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the predominance of small businesses characterises the NI defence sector, where the majority of the local defence supply chain is made up of SMEs. For instance, Thales Belfast, the major defence prime which supports an ecosystem of suppliers, reports that 91% of its local procurement in NI is with SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the British government’s view, SMEs bring a unique customer focus and agility that add value throughout the defence supply chain, contributing to its diversity and resilience. Across the UK in 2019–20 “they contributed work worth over £4.5 billion to defence projects, accounting for over 21% of Defence’s total spend with industry”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This importance is reflected in the DSIS, which sets out an ambitious vision for the future of MoD’s relations with industry. By recognising the UK’s defence industry is a strategic capability “in its own right”, the DSIS placed particular emphasis on the need to maximise opportunities for SMEs to do business with the MoD given their key role in enabling technology pull through and guaranteeing supply chain resilience. However, particularly in NI, these smaller businesses face real challenges in trying to move into defence. To assess them, interviews were conducted with individual companies and industrial bodies, and wider information was collected. The points below reflect those interviews, but many of the difficulties noted are common to small firms across NI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties in outreach beyond their region.&lt;/strong&gt; Geography and travel costs still matter, particularly for smaller businesses. One of the recurring difficulties reported by NI SMEs is linked to the distance of the region from London and southeast England, and the consequent difficulties in carrying out a straightforward personal conversation with figures in the MoD and Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;amp;S) without travelling to London, which can imply what are seen as significant financial costs. Similarly, the costs of getting to meet-the-buyer events and trade shows, which often but not always take place in the southeast of the UK, put a financial burden on these companies. This factor should be seen in perspective – while there are plenty of return airfares from Belfast to London that cost less than some second-class train fares within the UK mainland, a sense of distance has a psychological dimension, in addition to further costs such as hotel bills. Moreover, literature on the benefits of industrial clusters of cooperating firms suggests that geographical proximity matters, especially when the clusters are concentrated near large firms. Clustering is important for the competitiveness of smaller companies because of the advantage it creates in the value chain. According to Ebru Caymaz:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Clusters offer SMEs advantages for innovation through communication networks and strategic partnerships, increase their competitiveness at the international level, enable them to benefit from the input pool of large enterprises, develop new strategies and production techniques, and increase workforce skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of formal meetings, online participation can be a substitute, but it does not enable the informal, lunch and coffee break discussions that can be so useful. Thus, geographic separation from the commands, the MoD and the DE&amp;amp;S, as well as from most defence industrial events, is a real consideration for NI’s defence SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting security standards and classifications.&lt;/strong&gt; Across the UK, for those SMEs that are not yet in the defence space but aspire to pursue defence-related contracts, a key challenge is obtaining security clearances for people and facilities. Corporate and individual applicants for security clearances need a sponsor that is already qualified. However, most briefings on emerging defence projects are classified, so a non-traditional defence supplier can find itself in a chicken-and-egg situation in which it would need to access the content of the briefing to see how its organisation could contribute yet cannot get access without a security clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of awareness of the opportunities and support available for innovation and R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/strong&gt; SMEs often do not have the capacity to research the opportunities for defence work, such as those offered by the Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL). Defence is a complicated, multi-faceted sector and it takes effort to understand customer and supplier structures. Even understanding how to present bids to the MoD requires knowledge and experience. While it is true that DASA awards grants to NI companies and its support has been transformative for some, DASA covers NI from Scotland. This means that it can lack the local knowledge necessary to tailor funding calls to actual needs in NI. As a result, some SMEs have noted that many calls for R&amp;amp;D projects seem to be for blue-sky research, rather than being clearly market driven. Importantly, SMEs are drawn to market-focused projects so that they can achieve a faster return on their investment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of ownership and limited capacity to commercialise technology solutions.&lt;/strong&gt; Local stakeholders reported that DASA funding can have a transformative effect on their business and engaging with DASA provides a valuable front door to defence. The difficulty lies, however, beyond the DASA phase, in finding product champions committed to scaling up their solution, which can lead to stilted adoption and limited enablement. Many SMEs in NI operate in the Internet of Things space, and the problem they encounter with defence is that there is no focus on continuous improvement, an inconsistent feedback loop and no interest in driving return on investment, which is unusual in the digital solutions space and might disincentivise such businesses from pursuing defence work. Although transformative, DASA contracts are only the beginning of the journey, and it is difficult for SMEs to promote the appetite for their solutions, both in the services and in the primes, once the DASA phase is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the above leads to an overall reluctance from SMEs to pursue defence work. Further, there are several other generic aspects of governmental procurement in defence that do not favour SMEs. Government contract terms can require bidders to accept major liabilities in the event of implementation problems and these can potentially kill a business. SMEs are sometimes backed by venture capitalists who are looking for high profit rates on those firms in their portfolios which are successful, but high profits are not associated with government contracts. When the MoD proceeds without formal competition, the Single Source Regulations apply, restricting profit rates to around 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that although these challenges were highlighted in author conversations with NI SMEs, many apply to all parts of the UK. The MoD also points out that many were addressed in its 2019 SME Action Plan and that it has taken a series of steps to facilitate and improve SMEs’ access to UK defence. A follow-up to the 2019 commitments was issued in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the apparent situation is that, despite the efforts of the MoD at ministerial level to improve its exploitation of what SMEs could bring, many companies in NI still feel that defence is a particularly difficult market to access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-beyond-traditional-defence-players&quot;&gt;IV. Beyond Traditional Defence Players&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in previous chapters, NI has one Tier 1 defence firm (Thales), a large Tier 1 aerospace supplier (Spirit AeroSystems) and an aspiring Tier 2 defence shipbuilding firm (H&amp;amp;W). Each of these larger companies has the potential to mobilise smaller companies and/or non-traditional defence suppliers down the supply chain. The level of proximity and cohesion in the region means that more than 100 firms are within one hour’s drive of each other – a high density of suppliers across all elements of the aerospace supply chain, from design and manufacture (including capabilities in machining, composites and polymers), to coatings, assembly, certification and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;civil-aerospace&quot;&gt;Civil Aerospace&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NI enjoys an important civil aerospace legacy. Indeed, its aerospace and defence sector is a £1.5 billion industry employing an estimated 7,000 workers directly. According to media, “there are 60 firms in Northern Ireland whose manufacturing and systems already produce structures, components and services for nearly every commercial aircraft programme in the world”. The region also manufactures over one-third of all aeroplane seats and is a “global leader in survival technology”. Notably, in a region with less than 3% of the population of the UK, NI businesses won “one-third of the prestigious SC21 (Supply Chains for the 21st Century) Business Excellence Awards and 70% of the SC21 Gold Awards at the Farnborough International Airshow”. To achieve a gold award, a company must register a higher than 99% on-time delivery performance and 99.9% quality performance, as well as scoring more than 500 points in business, manufacturing and relationship excellence. Importantly, not only did Northern Irish companies such as Moyola Precision Engineering, Denroy and IPC Mouldings Ltd retain coveted SC21 Gold Standard status throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, but NI actually saw an increase in the number of companies attaining this standard during the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These capabilities reflect the fact that NI was the first region in the UK to develop a bespoke strategy for aerospace, following the launch of Lifting Off in 2014, under the theme Northern Ireland – Partnering for Growth. The strategy was designed to establish the required supply chain structure and develop the capabilities of NI companies through supply chain excellence to increase productivity and competitiveness. To support these efforts, a key regional innovation hub was established, the Northern Ireland Advanced Composites and Engineering Centre (NIACE). Opened in January 2012, NIACE currently has 12 participating companies from a variety of sectors, including aerospace, automotive, defence, environmental and marine. The participating companies regularly collaborate with Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University on joint research projects and on de-risking of research and development activities. Other initiatives, such as the National Aerospace Technology Exploitation Programme, encourage SMEs to collaborate with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the industry to develop new technological capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relevance of this is enhanced by the growing inter-relationships between the civil and military sectors. In an era where information capture and analysis are central to defence capability, surveillance and communications systems are often deployed on and in civil aircraft. In the UAS domain, such systems are increasingly used for both civil and military purposes. Thus, NI suppliers with certified qualities should explore and be considered for work in both the defence and civil sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-security-sector-and-the-role-of-education&quot;&gt;The Security Sector and the Role of Education&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a strong civilian aerospace pedigree in the region, defence could also make use of NI’s vibrant cyber-security sector. In the years since the Good Friday Agreement, NI has become a hotspot for cyber-security innovation, with cities such as Belfast and Derry/Londonderry exhibiting high technology specialism, consistently attracting domestic and overseas investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current cyber-security ecosystem in NI consists of more than 120 businesses that provide cyber-security goods and services. The Belfast city area is home to 84% of all NI cyber firms, which highlights the city’s status as a UK cyber hub with emerging technology specialists, ranked second in the UK and ninth globally in the top 25 Tech Cities of the Future for 2020/21. Belfast is “Europe’s leading foreign direct investment destination for new software development”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent study estimates that there are 2,299 cyber security employees currently within NI’s cyber sector, with an average income of £48,400 in 2020. This indicates that the sector currently contributes more than £110 million in yearly wages to the NI economy. This is significant since NI has long struggled with private sector productivity and wage levels. Cyber security is a big economic opportunity for the region, with salaries much exceeding the NI private sector median levels and offering a solid foundation for growing NI private sector productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has attracted considerable investment, both domestically and overseas. The UK government has recently announced an £18.9-million investment in NI’s cyber security industry, including £11 million in government funding through the New Deal for NI, to establish a pipeline of cyber-security specialists in NI while also assisting firms and start-ups in developing new prospects. This surge of momentum behind cyber security in NI is helping to attract significant foreign investment, particularly from the US, a key investment partner, with 37 firms employing 1,432 cyber-security professionals (62% of NI-based cyber-security employment). This employment is significant as it has the ability to encourage skill development, increase investment in NI and have a positive impact on the larger ecosystem, not least in the defence space. Thanks to its vibrant cyber-security landscape, NI was recently appointed the new location for the next government-backed Digital Catapult Centre, with the aim of better showcasing NI’s tech capacity in areas such as advanced sensors, analytics and cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key to this success was the region’s promotion of strong connections between industry and education, championed by local institutions such as Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University. Both are pivotal in nurturing a talent pipeline of trained security professionals and in producing industry engagement by embedding academic staff in industry and embracing an “open innovation model”. The aim of this model is to enable “research to translate to industry in an agile way, ensuring demonstrable technology is in the hands of end users quickly”. While more frequent in the security space, this collaboration model is now unfolding in relation to the defence sector too. For instance, the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT) at Queen’s University Belfast has recently partnered with BAE Systems on video-based semantic analysis of crowd behaviour, while Thales has used CSIT novel Physical Unclonable Functions technology in a demonstrator for electronic component anti-counterfeiting. The private sector must play its part in promoting the opportunities it offers, and emerging regional defence players such as H&amp;amp;W might wish to fill any awareness gaps there may be about, for instance, the scale of BAE Systems’ work with young people in Barrow, aimed at meeting its submarine-building skills needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in information technology and modifications to existing weapons with ISR systems means that the cyber and defence sectors are now deeply interrelated, as are the innovation challenges and skillsets required by both industries. Through its cyber-security clusters and academic centres of excellence, NI has developed beyond UK average science and technology capabilities, nurtured science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills, and established leading R&amp;amp;D programmes. These activities are the basis for generating military and security capabilities and other tangible and intangible assets which are themselves levers of national power and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper found considerable NI corporate interest in securing more work in defence. There are three different but complementary prominent businesses in the region: Thales, an experienced defence-focused business unit; H&amp;amp;W, a heavy-engineering firm at the centre of the National Shipbuilding Strategy’s aim of regenerating the shipbuilding sector; and Spirit AeroSystems, a high-technology aerospace company looking to expand into the defence space. Together with the extensive range of SMEs in the region, there is an opportunity to promote NI, not as part of the problem set of UK defence and security, but as a valued contributor to its management and solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has also identified the main challenges related to conducting defence business in NI. Understanding and mitigating these challenges and leveraging the capabilities of local defence establishments is key to improving NI productivity and prosperity, ensuring national resilience, and ensuring that the UK’s industrial base remains capable of delivering high-quality capabilities. This chapter presents conclusions and recommendations for possible next steps for UK defence to help tackle these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defence-spending-across-the-uk&quot;&gt;Defence Spending Across the UK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is axiomatic but not assured that behaviour within government should match the directions set in governmental policy. As noted early, the MoD direction is that the whole of the UK should benefit from defence spending. Until very recently, gain for NI was minimal and, even with the contracts with Thales and the FSS contract involving H&amp;amp;W, the immediate future will not be much different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be beneficial to have a small team from the MoD tasked with understanding the business environment in the NI context and, in particular to gather data on the extent and complexity of regional supply chains and how to better integrate them in the broader UK defence industrial base. The intent would be to ensure that opportunities for securing useful work from NI firms are not overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a matter on which the House of Commons Defence Committee could keep a weather eye. To date, NI has received only modest attention from the Defence Committee in Parliament. Some members visited Belfast in February 2023, but this was not part of a formal evidence session and was primarily prompted by the need to look at the industrial agility of Thales for the delivery of NLAWs. Had Russia not invaded Ukraine and had Thales not been at the forefront of NLAWs supply, there would have been little interest in the defence enterprise in NI. The last Defence Committee visit to NI took place in 2016. The Committee has little hard power, but when it identifies and publicises an issue it can prompt the MoD to direct attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-three-major-defence-opportunity-firms&quot;&gt;The Three Major Defence Opportunity Firms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The three major defence-related firms in NI find themselves in a new situation, although the nature of each situation is different. Thales’ factory is emerging as a clear player in the munitions issues that have been exposed by the conflict in Ukraine. H&amp;amp;W faces the challenges of re-establishing an industrial shipbuilding capability that will require the recruitment and training of a workforce and the modernisation of its infrastructure. Spirit AeroSystems is seeking to break into further defence activity using its expertise in composite materials and aerospace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Thales has been awarded a contract to replace weapons supplied to Ukraine, its plant in Belfast needs to be recognised as a key element in the UK position on defence capability, operational independence and military sustainability. While longer-term munitions measures dealing with enhanced stock levels, production surge capabilities and international cooperation are emerging as matters for urgent attention, the MoD needs to recognise that the Thales plant will require a long-term drumbeat of development and production work to maintain it as a thriving entity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For H&amp;amp;W, the DE&amp;amp;S and National Shipbuilding Office should not stand back, adopt a hands-off stance and simply see what happens with the FSS project. With the FSS contract, the DE&amp;amp;S has pursued its normal practice of passing as much financial risk as possible to the contractor. However, Navantia could seek to reduce its financial risk by bringing as much work as possible into Spain. Commercially that could be a rational stance. Members of the Defence Committee have already made clear their concerns that Navantia would not be unhappy to keep H&amp;amp;W in a junior role and do most of the work in Spain. But from a UK government perspective, the FSS contract signals a wider aim of increasing prosperity and social value in NI as well as generating additional industrial shipbuilding options for the future. By judging the Navantia bid to have been the best, the MoD has put its own reputation on the line. Thus, the UK governmental bodies should be both monitoring closely how H&amp;amp;W are progressing in Belfast (and Appledore) and looking to see what support and guidance they can provide to H&amp;amp;W.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spirit AeroSystems UK is the UK entity of a much larger US parent which actively supports the defence development of its UK business. Its capabilities and strategic direction, including its stated readiness to grow by investment in the UK, are noteworthy. Its expertise in the development and production of composite structures means that it should be studied in detail by technical experts in government and the private sector. In order to make sense of Spirit’s potential, the MoD will likely have to rely not just on DSTL and DASA but also on its QinetiQ-led Aurora contract. The MoD should also recognise the need to protect any intellectual property that Spirit shares. One issue for government is whether Spirit should be operated as a competitor to GKN Aerospace and its partners in composite development for aerospace, or whether they should be encouraged to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A specific issue relates to the UK government direction in the DSIS that its forces should enjoy operational independence and that British society should enjoy economic benefits from defence procurement. UK reliance on US systems for surveillance and intelligence (the P-8A, Wedgetail, Reaper and Rivet Joint) makes clear the limitations on these ambitions. Working with Spirit on defence applications should not deepen UK vulnerability to export restrictions, especially the International Trade in Armaments Regulations, but the import of Spirit management and generic technology exploitation for defence could mean significant levelling up and prosperity benefits for NI. It could also support the export of specialist defence sub-systems to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are now few military units in NI, but each of the three services have senior military leads (SMLs) in each of the four nations of the UK. Their current role encompasses a series of representational and stakeholder engagement duties, mostly service related.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since it is the services who are placing the requirements against which the DE&amp;amp;S and the Defence Infrastructure Organisation are delivering and designing the tendering process, there is value in industry having access to the SMLs, who could at least point them in the right directions in service headquarters and the DE&amp;amp;S. Additionally, local representative officers from the Royal Navy and the Army should establish familiarity with the progress and challenges of the FSS project and, in the case of the Army, with Thales’ missile capability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ni-smes&quot;&gt;NI SMEs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most firms interested in defence in NI are SMEs, which clearly have similar problems to similarly sized companies across the UK in seeking success in the defence sector. As discussed earlier, MoD attitudes to financial and technical risk, its required contracting terms and preference for time-consuming and costly formal competitive tendering are likely obstacles for many firms. However, the MoD’s own figures show that SMEs across the country are in receipt of more than 20% of government defence spending, whether directly through contracts from government or through primes, so the situation is far from hopeless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MoD strategies for SME engagement overall are beyond the scope of this paper, but nonetheless it is suggested that the MoD keeps its practices under constant review. If it wants to better leverage the potential of SMEs for technology “pull through”, it must think more about what it needs to do to be an attractive customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In NI, the SME community stated that its difficulties associated with winning defence business for NI are partly linked to the location of the region and the costs of travel for small firms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While NI firms must recognise that reaching out to customers is a necessary business expense, the MoD could endeavour to minimise the costs to aspiring suppliers. Possible steps could include holding industry briefing days in locations near a major airport or in Belfast, and starting such gatherings in the late morning, helping firms to avoid hotel costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ADS director in NI discussed the number of NI SMEs involved in industry and stressed how the number had increased rapidly in recent years. Thus, there is a new situation in the province which could have been overlooked by UK authorities. The ADS team in NI are vocal and energetic promoters of the region’s SME potential, and ADS remains the leading trade organisation there. However, elsewhere in the UK, in England and Wales, the main body representing SMEs has emerged as Make UK Defence, within the wider manufacturing body Make UK. Historically, this came about because the aerospace and defence industrial bodies (ADS and before that the Society of British Aerospace Companies – SBAC) were considered to be dominated by the large primes. When the SBAC and the Defence Manufacturers Association merged to form ADS, there was a perceived need for a more SME-focused body, which is met in 2023 by Make UK Defence. These industrial bodies are collaborators, but also competitors for members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given that Make UK Defence is the prominent body for SMEs in England and Wales, and ADS has that role in NI, it would be sensible for them to work together to secure the best deals for SMEs across the UK. If two bodies do not send coherent and compatible messages, both are less likely to have an impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defence-in-ni&quot;&gt;Defence in NI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While NI hosts a plethora of innovative SMEs and micro-businesses, further support is needed to enable a cohesive regional defence and security sector to collaborate, overcome barriers to entry and help supply chains to compete and realise new technologies. The maritime and aerospace sectors, for instance, both prominent in NI, tend to operate in silos, leaving considerable space for further synergies between businesses operating in different sectors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ADS and Make UK Defence should support the development of more and active clusters of SMEs in the region with defence interests. Such semi-formal groupings could focus on the three obvious defence sectors (aircraft, ships and munitions) but could also address the defence and wider security sector as a whole. In the UK, as observed earlier, the MoD has supported the advance of a defence-wide cluster for the southwest of England. An NI defence and security cluster could build on existing arrangements such as the NI Cyber Security Cluster and the Belfast Maritime Consortium, which could exploit the existence of well-established technology hubs such as the NIACE.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such clusters work best when the member organisations have access to and can share awareness of the key problems facing potential customers. Given the proliferating interest in UASs, a cluster linking Spirit with information-focused SMEs in NI would have potential. Informational inputs from the MoD and the services would lubricate regional industrial thinking and initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The military situation in Ukraine, the MoD’s readiness to react through private investment in H&amp;amp;W by issuing the FSS contract, Spirit’s enthusiasm to do more in the defence space and the growth in the number of SMEs joining ADS all point to a multi-faceted resurgence of interest in the defence sector in NI. The national political context is such that the UK government is concerned to capture the economic and social value attributes of defence spending and to see that all regions of the country benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MoD should have a specified target for an increased amount of defence work in NI. This is not to suggest that defence spending per head should rise to the levels in Scotland or even the national average, but that there should be a focused exploration of possibilities of raising it above the trivial amount at which it currently stands. This effort should involve initiatives from across the UK defence acquisition community in the MoD, the armed services, the various procurement bodies in governmental defence, especially the DE&amp;amp;S, Defence Digital, and the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, and the private sector. Such an effort would be highly compatible with the MoD’s levelling-up and prosperity agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a need finally to consider the wider impact of an increased defence industrial effort in NI. While some nationalists might resent such direct support for UK military power, the authors’ conversations with local stakeholders suggest that change that brings well-paid and secure jobs, and that requires people to work with others regardless of their sectarian origin, would have an integrating and conciliatory impact on society.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

As Antonio Giustozzi explains, the Islamic State in Khorasan has now turned on the Taliban, drawing attention to the complexity of extreme right-wing terrorism, deeply entrenched as it is in the social fabric of Afghanistan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2021, the Taliban suddenly went from being an insurgent organisation, not alien to deploying terrorist tactics, to being a government, even if not recognised by anybody as such as yet. The Taliban themselves were shocked by their faster-than-anticipated rise to power, and were caught unprepared. They had to move quickly, and figure out how to (re)organise the state apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If capturing the state had always been their aim, more unexpected was the fact that they also had to come up with a counter-terrorism strategy. This was because the competing insurgents of the Islamic State (IS) in Khorasan did not wither away, contrary to what many Taliban had expected, who were seeing it largely as a proxy of the previous government, and hence imagined that it would melt away. Instead, after a lull of a few weeks, the IS was back with a renewed campaign of terrorist attacks in the cities, more intense and widespread than the Taliban’s own in earlier years. After initially targeting religious minorities almost exclusively (as it had done before August 2021), the IS gradually widened its targets to include Taliban state institutions and pro-Taliban clerics; eventually, it would start targeting individual Taliban officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the IS in Khorasan has embarked on a transformation, from being primarily an insurgent organisation which deployed terrorist tactics in urban environments to one almost entirely focused on terrorist campaign. By 2022, it had given up on a half-hearted attempt to wage a guerrilla war in the east, and went completely underground, forming secret cells and abandoning all fixed bases. Once a very centralised organisation willing to challenge its enemies and especially the Taliban on the open battlefield, the IS had to change its modus operandi and adopt a much more decentralised structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to run a structure based on hundreds of small cells, the IS became dependent on producing a steady flow of reliable cadres. Its original character of being a coalition of disparate hardline Taliban, Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Central Asian splinter groups had already been changing over the years. The in-flow of former Taliban and TTP members had largely dried up by 2017 and casualties wore down the original nuclei (which in 2014–15 had come together in the so-called “Wilayah Khorasan” (Khorasan province)). The IS had to rely more and more on other sources of recruits, and found them in the Salafi community and in various radical Islamist groups such as Hizb ut Tahrir, whose ideologies had some contiguity with that of the IS and were mostly active among university students. With that, the ideological unity and “quality” of the IS in Khorasan’s rank and file improved, but the bulk of the new recruits were still poorly educated villagers, typically brought into the organisation by community elders who felt the community was threatened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After August 2021, Salafi madrasas and university graduates became even more important because of this need for ideologically dependable, even fanatically committed, cadres to staff the small cells that had become the mainstay of the organisation. The Taliban, now the de facto government, cracked down on Salafi madrasas, closing down any that they suspected of supplying recruits to the IS. As a result, the importance of universities as a source of recruits increased further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IS in Khorasan managed to establish a strong presence in the universities of Kabul and Nangarhar quite rapidly once it started focusing more on the Salafi community and pious individuals leaning towards Salafism. They were helped by the fact that, in order to stem the influence of the Taliban in the Islamic Law Faculty of Kabul University, the Afghan authorities had encouraged the appointment of Salafi professors, several of whom were later accused of helping the IS recruit among students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban did not waste much time in cracking down on IS recruitment in the universities, imposing a strict security regime. Recruitment became harder for the IS, but not impossible, especially as it moved much of its recruitment activity online. My recently published report discusses in detail the adaptation of the IS in Afghanistan’s university campuses, and how it developed a sophisticated system to attract new recruits without taking excessive risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In brief, the IS formed specialised cells, each tasked to focus on a particular phase of the recruitment process. A team would identify suitable recruits among Salafi or Salafi-leaning students, known to have poor relations with Taliban security staff, with non-Salafi teachers, or with Hanafi and Shi’a students. These individuals would then be targeted for recruitment, first by a dedicated team inviting them to social media accounts sharing strict Salafist literature and videos. Then, depending on their response, another team would step in, sharing with them more political, pro-IS material via private chats. Finally, assuming the targeted recruit does not bail out, a third team would start face-to-face contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s security regime has been limiting the ability of the IS to recruit in university campuses to somewhere between 100-200 students per year, according to IS sources that appear quite credible (given also that it seems a relatively modest claim). This number may indeed appear modest, but these recruits then mostly turn into cadres, whom the IS deems of essential importance for maintaining and reinforcing the ideological strength of the organisation. Few of these recruits turn into regular fighters or even commanders; instead, they staff the terror cells or take up the job of trainer/indoctrinator, an increasingly essential role in an organisation that needs to stiffen the ideological conformity of its members. Whereas in the past it was common to recruit members of the Salafi community, even villagers, and induce them into the organisation without much indoctrination, now the three-month-long ideological/religious training courses are much more important, so more trainers are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban have of course noticed the shift towards online activities and have tried to disrupt them with some success. But social media propaganda and recruitment does not need to be carried out locally, at least not entirely, and indeed a growing number of propagandists of the IS in Khorasan are based in Europe and other locations outside Afghanistan. The Taliban are trying to infiltrate their private chats, in order to identify the cells based inside Afghanistan. So far, the IS has been able to maintain the bulk of its social media operations, despite some losses. Overall, the Taliban have been quicker at taking on the mantle of counter-terrorism than many thought they would, but the IS remains a highly adaptive organisation that will likely defy attempts to destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;

It also tests common assertions around the effects of Brexit, reductions in the UK aid budget, and the merger of two government departments, the Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, successive British governments have sought to emphasise that a post-Brexit UK would be outward looking, collaborative and influential. A series of speeches and policy statements emphasised that the UK would pursue future prosperity through overseas engagements built upon investments in diplomacy, trade, defence and development aid. In March 2021, the UK government published its Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy. The document reiterated these themes and referenced Eastern Africa as a part of the world where the UK would increase its engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, a RUSI research team set out to examine how the UK has deployed its development, defence and diplomacy toolkit in four countries in Eastern Africa since 2015. The project, entitled “Furthering Global Britain? Reviewing the Foreign Policy Effect of UK Engagement in East Africa”, seeks to identify the factors that have helped or hindered the UK in pursuing a “Global Britain” agenda in four countries in the region: Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan. The research tested some common assertions around the effects of Brexit, reductions in the UK aid budget, and the merger of two government departments: the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper sets out findings on the UK’s relevant engagements in one of the four focus countries, Sudan, from 2015 to the present. It finds that, despite a chequered past, the UK has had significant leverage at key moments, building on a long history of engagement. There have been some successes in recent years. Examples include careful use of diplomacy and development aid in support of conflict resolution and humanitarian relief. The UK has also worked to support inclusion of civilians in government and to help Sudan manage economic and political crises from 2019 to the present. While the Sudanese may be disappointed by the record of Sudan’s hybrid civilian–military government of 2019–20, the UK is still well regarded overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding an “integrated approach” to UK foreign policy, Sudan has provided few opportunities to pursue defence engagement or promote trade since 2016. Use of development aid and diplomacy have, however, become more integrated over the period, as envisaged by UK government policy. The unplanned merger of DFID and the FCO, though time-consuming and frustrating, has also offered benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK relationships in Sudan have weathered Brexit well. The UK enjoys substantial depth and quality of partnerships both in Sudan and with regional actors. Its ability to operate in multiple forums, from New York to Khartoum and the immediate region, via a combination of envoys, ambassadors, political and aid specialists and multilateral bodies, is significant. The UK has been particularly effective in two groupings: the UK–US–Norwegian “Troika” and the “Quad” (the US, the UK, Saudi Arabia and the UAE – also at times referred to as “the Quartet”). Astute UK involvement here has helped to compensate for a post-Brexit loss of influence over EU policy and expenditure. Linked to Brexit, however, the paralysis that characterised British politics during 2019–20 has been detrimental. It drew the attention of ministers and senior decision-makers away from Sudan at a critical moment in Sudan’s history and contributed to perceptions of declining UK influence in Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sudan has not been prioritised as the 2021 Integrated Review suggested it would be. The lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic response, Brexit, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have all diverted the UK’s attention and resources. After a brief increase linked to a 2019 political transition in Sudan, the UK aid budget has levelled off. Although aid agencies in receipt of UK aid have been alarmed, the real-world impact of this is hard to gauge, given the fragile state of Sudan’s economy. Reductions also coincided with an overall decline in humanitarian aid contributions from other donors. Nevertheless, a solid reputation and substantial influence that the UK has earned within the aid sector in Sudan is now seen as being at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the research finds that commentators expect UK influence in Sudan to wane in the years ahead. Brexit has played a part in this, but aid cuts and the visible rise of competitors such as China are more salient factors. In the research for this paper, interviews revealed a general sense of frustration that the former colonial power would not commit further resources to Sudan, along with a feeling that the UK appears too willing to back a compromise with military actors amid a contested political “transition”. Interviews also show that many pro-democracy campaigners expect the UK and Western allies to play a conservative hand in future: that, despite clear evidence of the Sudanese military’s role in driving disorder, they will seek stability through a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding its many problems, Sudan represents what practitioners might call a “medium-sized” challenge. If senior decision-makers were willing, the UK might help shape the country’s trajectory through technical leadership, financial assistance and support to political coalition-building. Alongside humanitarian relief and reform, other areas of traditional UK expertise, from stabilisation to governance and security sector reform to economic development, will be critical to Sudan’s future. The UK could plausibly convene others around these topics. It might also play a useful role facilitating much-needed dialogue among disparate pro-democracy groups. To maximise its effectiveness, the UK should, however, work alongside others to identify the lessons of recent years and to forge coalitions and strategies that might in time lead towards a fully democratised Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the June 2016 Brexit vote, successive UK prime ministers Theresa May and Boris Johnson repeatedly made reference to “Global Britain”. The phrase attracted widespread commentary, much of it quizzical or critical. It was, however, an attempt to signal a sense that the UK would remain an outward-looking country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2021, the UK government published the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy. The document recognised a more competitive global context than in 2016 but reiterated now-familiar “Global Britain” themes. It signalled a wish to play a proactive role in global affairs; to work in partnership with others, particularly “like-minded bilateral and multilateral partners”; and to better integrate foreign policy, defence, trade and international development efforts. Africa was referenced in terms of forging problem-solving partnerships and pursuing shared goals such as prosperity, democracy and security. The policy referenced overseas aid, while leaning strongly towards promoting trade, economic resilience and the alignment of international development with wider foreign policy. Specific references were made to Eastern Africa, in the case of Sudan to support for “conflict resolution and stabilisation efforts”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2023, the Integrated Review Refresh was published to provide an update of the government’s policy priorities amid a changing global context since the Integrated Review of 2021. Although no longer using the language of “Global Britain”, the key themes remain unchanged. Africa is again flagged a region where the UK government would deepen relationships. More emphasis than before was placed on pursuing international development alongside “the full range of UK strengths and expertise”. Against this backdrop, a RUSI research team has set out to examine how the UK has deployed its development, defence and diplomacy toolkit in Eastern Africa in support of the UK government’s agenda for a more integrated, proactive foreign policy in the region. The team looked at how the government sought to bring about positive change in the countries in which it is working while also securing secondary, largely geopolitical, benefits in its national interest at a time of domestic and international change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A two-year research project has sought to test some of the assertions that have been made around Brexit, the reduction in the UK aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of Gross National Income (GNI), the increases in the defence budget, and the creation of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office (FCDO) from a merger of the Department for International Development (DFID) with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). The project, entitled “Furthering Global Britain? Reviewing the Foreign Policy Effect of UK Engagement in East Africa”, asks whether these structural changes have helped or hindered the progress of recent UK governments’ “Global Britain” policy agendas in the region, while seeking to identify factors that may have contributed to or limited the UK’s ability to project influence. It aims to answer the following research questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How effective has the UK been in making a positive difference in relation to “Global Britain” objectives in the region in recent years, particularly through its development aid, diplomacy and defence engagement?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What impact have recent structural and policy changes such as Brexit, aid cuts and the merger of DFID and the FCO had on “Global Britain” outcomes?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the UK’s approach and impact differ from those of others?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do UK aid priorities for Eastern Africa align with those of East African governments, and what are those governments’ expectations of and recommendations for the UK?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research methodology consisted of a review of selected policy literature and semi-structured expert interviews (see Table 1). Interviews were used to identify factors that recurrently enabled or constrained UK actions, particularly with reference to positive outcomes to which the UK was thought to have contributed. Data on UK aid, defence and diplomatic engagement in the four focal countries from 2015 to 2022 is used as a reference point to identify UK policy objectives and trends over time. The intention is to provide an overview of the realities of UK engagement in each country over this six-year period, and to identify the factors that were most salient in driving outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper provides findings on the UK’s engagement in Sudan. It is based on a review of key secondary sources and 51 interviews carried out between November 2021 and October 2022 with current and former government officials, staff from multilateral organisations, academics, and civil society and business figures, a substantial number of them based in Sudan (see Table 1). Research concluded prior to the outbreak of fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in April 2023 (see Chapter I below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I provides background on Sudan–UK relations and summarises the UK’s major policy interests and its main investments in international development, diplomatic and defence engagement in recent years. From within this broad portfolio of work, Chapter II highlights several examples of UK action that have contributed positively to outcomes in Sudan. Chapter III identifies key factors that have constrained or enabled UK action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This publication should be read in conjunction with accompanying papers on the UK in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia, and an earlier publication that sets out the project methodology and offers more detail on UK investments in the region. A synthesis paper that combines findings from the four focus countries will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-background&quot;&gt;I. Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has longstanding ties with the Republic of Sudan, a former colony. The long period from 1881 to 1899, termed the “Mahdist War”, saw British and allied Egyptian forces pitted against the Mahdi (Muhammad Ahmad – an Islamic puritan, reformer and military leader) in a series of bloody confrontations. From 1899 to 1956 Britain had de facto control of the country, although “Anglo-Egyptian Sudan” was legally a joint condominium. Following independence in 1956, relations with the UK were maintained through historical ties, trade and aid. The UK is now home to a significant and longstanding Sudanese diaspora of around 20,000 people, and attracts additional migrants and refugees each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post-independence, from 1956 to 1972, Sudan experienced the first of two civil wars. An imperfect peace ended in 1983 as the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) fought the Sudanese government and its various southern Sudanese rivals. The second war ended in 2005 with a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) brokered via the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD). The UK, the US and Norway were strong supporters. Although the three governments held somewhat different positions (for example, the UK was seen by Khartoum as more sympathetic to its position; Norway and the US were seen as leaning towards the SPLM/A), all three worked together as a “Troika”. Linked to the Troika, the UK played a notable role in the CPA negotiations, among other things pushing the parties to meet a 31 December 2004 deadline for completing talks. The UK remained active in the follow-on period. The entire process that led to eventual South Sudanese independence in 2011, including peace negotiations, a referendum and elections, was only possible with the active participation of the north. Throughout the period to 2011, the US was the leading international actor in dealings with the government of Sudan. UK aid and diplomatic contributions were prominent, however, and included seconding a senior diplomat, Derek Plumbly, to head the Assessment and Evaluation Commission established to monitor implementation of the CPA. As many in the government of Sudan came to recognise, the UK was able to moderate and influence the US on occasion. According to interviewees, it also took on tasks such as defence cooperation that, due to domestic pressure, the US could not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through most of this period the Sudanese Republic was a military-influenced autocracy led by President Omar Al-Bashir and the Islamic National Front, the Islamist movement that had formed the National Congress Party (NCP) in the late 1990s. The UK’s relationship with Sudan proved difficult throughout Al-Bashir’s 30-year rule. Large-scale atrocities across the Darfur region in the early 2000s led to a 2007 UN Security Council Resolution authorising a Chapter VII peacekeeping mission – what was to become the African Union–United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) – against Al-Bashir’s wishes, with strong public statements from then UK prime minister Gordon Brown. The UK acted as the lead P5 Security Council member during subsequent peacekeeping mission mandate negotiations. London also subscribed to a suite of UN and EU sanctions and later supported International Criminal Court (ICC) indictments against key government officials, including Al-Bashir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CPA, however, offered a framework for UK re-engagement. From 2008 until the mid-2010s, the UK provided key technical and diplomatic support to the linked African Union High Level Implementation Panel for Sudan (AUHIP) forum. As respondents pointed out, it was the principal donor to AUHIP and, among other things, paid for technical advisers to support the forum. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) organised trainings and exchange visits for Sudanese security officials, and at one point a UK defence attaché was seconded as a military adviser. A few interviewees credited the UK’s support with helping to avert war between north and south during the tense post-independence period, and with strengthening the AU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2014 the UK and Sudan were participants in an EU–Horn of Africa Migration Route Initiative – the so-called Khartoum Process. A response to increased outward migration to Europe and the UK, it led to funding and capacity building for Sudanese security bodies. These included the notorious Janjaweed militia. The initiative proved highly controversial. Many questioned the wisdom of engaging with what they saw as a pariah government, and there were allegations of hypocrisy and the compromising of professed Western values. Critics pointed to evidence that the government of Sudan was displacing people through violence in its periphery, while in some cases facilitating the onward transit of Eritrean, Somali and Ethiopian migrants. The programme underscored the fact that, despite public condemnations, the UK and the EU were prepared to work closely with the Sudanese government in response to domestic policy pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2016 a UK–Sudan Strategic Dialogue was established – a contact forum in which senior officials discussed such issues as sanctions, trade and migration. But with sanctions still in place and an ICC arrest warrant out against the head of state, the Dialogue proved difficult and controversial. UK officials were unable to meet with Al-Bashir himself and began talking through intermediaries. Interviewees pointed out that establishing a dialogue framework fuelled allegations that the UK government had accepted Sudan’s price for cooperation on the outward migration that its own human rights abuses had generated. Nevertheless, the forum provided a vehicle for discussing challenging issues, including those associated with the secession of the south. Although activity in the forum was halted due to an outbreak of violence over north– south borders and oil in 2012, early progress was made on the important question of Sudanese debt relief, as discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2018, conditions were changing. Al-Bashir had lost oil revenues following the independence of South Sudan in 2011 and could no longer finance his patronage budget, nor imports of food and fuel. He ramped up the export production of crops, livestock and gold by printing local currency to pay above-market rates. This fed inflation. Import costs rose and urban living standards plummeted. Large-scale protests took off in December 2018, coalescing into nationwide resistance. Al-Bashir’s former political allies eventually launched a coup against him in April 2019, establishing a Transitional Military Council (TMC) that brought the once-peripheral RSF and its leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti) to the centre of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After further demonstrations, and the massacre on 3 June 2019 of more than 120 civilians outside the headquarters of the military in Khartoum, the TMC bowed to domestic and international pressure, signing a July 2019 Constitutional Charter with the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC), a coalition of political, professional and civic groups. Interviews found that, alongside the AU and IGAD, the UK and the US were key players influencing the process, doing so via the informal grouping known as the Quad, crucially convincing the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which both have strong connections to the SAF, to pressure Sudan’s security elite to compromise. The Constitutional Charter put in place a civilian–military transitional government with a civilian prime minister and cabinet staffed almost entirely by technocrats. This included diaspora figures such as incoming prime minister Abdalla Hamdok, alongside an executive Sovereign Council comprising five military and five civilian figures and chaired by the head of the military General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, with RSF leader Hemedti as his deputy. There was to be a 39-month transitional period during which, among other things, a new legislature would be appointed, a constitution drafted and transitional justice measures introduced prior to elections. In the interim the Sovereign Council was to be chaired by the military for the first 21 months and by civilians for the final 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2019, soon after the transitional government took office, peace talks started with the Sudan Revolutionary Front, a composite of rebel groups, to bring these groups into the military and transitional government and to redress a historical power imbalance between Sudan’s centre and its long-neglected peripheries. The resulting October 2020 Juba Peace Agreement provided a wealth-sharing formula, or “payroll peace”. In February 2021 armed group representatives joined Hamdok’s government, many replacing technocrats as part of a larger reshuffle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attempted transition away from armed conflict was accompanied by high-stakes economic reforms to address a rapidly deteriorating economy with serious structural flaws. To control inflation and reduce debt, Hamdok cut subsidies on many staples. The inflationary impact was immediate, with a knock-on effect on food security in the months following. A social safety net programme called the Family Support Programme ( Thamarat) was to be implemented simultaneously to soften the economic impact. At the same time, efforts were made to catalogue and regulate parastatal companies owned or run by the military, and to investigate cronyism via a new Elimination, Empowerment, Anti-Corruption and Funds Recovery Committee. The increasingly successful impact of these reforms and investigations sparked a backlash, however: to preserve their power and commercial interests, and fearing moves to hold them accountable for past abuses, the RSF and the SAF launched a coup in October 2021. Hamdok was arrested and civilian institutions were dissolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid international condemnation, Western and multilateral foreign aid totalling approximately $4.6 billion and planned debt relief worth $56 billion were suspended. Most Western countries, including the UK, condemned the coup, but opted not to reimpose sanctions. The military regime established in October 2021 remains in place to date. Despite repression, activists linked to both the FFC and neighbourhood “resistance committees” have continued to protest and demand a fully civilian-led government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These events have compounded an ongoing food crisis – in December 2022, around 11.7 million people were assessed as facing crisis-level food insecurity; a marked increase from the period to summer 2019. Against this backdrop, political negotiations have made slow progress. A “Tripartite Mechanism” led by the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS), the AU and IGAD has struggled to broker a compromise. Both military and civilian groupings are riven with internal divisions. On 5 December 2022, the FFC and the military signed a framework agreement providing for eventual elections and a civilian-headed administration. Rather than providing a route out of instability, the agreement proved to be a harbinger of fresh conflict. Unable to resolve differences over command and control, fighting broke out in Khartoum on 15 April 2023 between the SAF and the RSF. At the time of writing hundreds of casualties had been reported. With violence spreading, scenarios could include an all-out war. Foreign governments have raced to evacuate their nationals while calling for calm. With tensions between the SAF and the RSF well-documented, the approach that external actors from the UN to the US and UK have taken towards deal-making and democratisation is being scrutinised. While they hold some basic “red lines” in common, what is referred to as the Sudanese “street” – an amorphous collection of youth and student movements, unions, civic initiatives, ordinary citizens and neighbourhood resistance committees – is also fragmented. Many Sudanese pro-democracy voices have been fiercely critical of the December 2022 framework agreement, the recent violence and external responses to it. It remains to be seen whether this broad set of actors, including politicians, professionals, unions, local resistance committees and students, can coalesce around a common vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uk-policy-priorities-and-engagements&quot;&gt;UK Policy Priorities and Engagements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government has publicly stated that a more peaceful, democratic and economically resilient Sudan is in the UK’s interest, as this would reduce the need for UK aid, lessen outward migration and provide opportunities for UK businesses to invest in the country. In 2021 it committed to continue supporting “conflict resolution and stabilisation efforts”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter offers a summary of the UK’s engagements in recent years in the areas of development, humanitarian aid, diplomacy and defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development and Humanitarian Engagements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK bilateral aid commitments to Sudan averaged around £90 million per annum between 2016 and 2020. Recent programmes funded by UK official development assistance (ODA) have contributed to humanitarian relief and humanitarian system reform; economic reform via the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank; programmes to reduce female genital mutilation and child marriage; schemes to improve access to water and sanitation; civil society support; and targeted support for the Juba Peace Agreement. The highest expenditure items have been humanitarian relief, social safety net support and, briefly, economic reform (see Figure 2). The UK played a leading role in supporting Sudan to obtain Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) status in 2021. This arrangement, now on hold following the coup, would have enabled relief on around 90% of the country’s $50-billion IMF and World Bank debts in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Trends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK bilateral aid spending increased from £93 million in 2019 to £139 million in 2020, an increase linked to the political transition. Most of this increase was due to a one-off contribution to the Sudan Family Support Project, as discussed further below. This briefly made Sudan the 10th-largest recipient of UK aid globally. While humanitarian assistance still accounted for around 37.8% of UK bilateral funding, support for “government and civil society”, and “social infrastructure and services” increased after the appointment of the 2019 transitional government (increases of 9.5% to 23.4%, and 3.1% to 14.5%, respectively). UK bilateral ODA funding for Sudan then dropped back to £93 million by the end of 2021. The reduction – due both to global UK aid cuts and the suspension of development programming following the October 2021 military coup – still left Sudan as the ninth-largest recipient of UK bilateral ODA worldwide. Following the coup, however, the UK, together with the US, the World Bank and other major donors, suspended all non-humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British diplomatic engagement with Sudan has historically focused on a range of issues, from regional stability to counterterrorism, humanitarian relief, governance, security and migration. The emphasis among these themes has varied according to the changing local and global context. Important diplomatic initiatives have over the years included a leading role in the negotiations that led to the CPA, subsequent support to the AUHIP process, the establishment of the UK–Sudan Dialogue and acting as Penholder for UN missions designed to mitigate conflict. The UK maintains a permanent ambassadorial presence in Sudan, backed by an envoy for Sudan and South Sudan. Since the CPA years, a London-based “Sudans” Unit’ has existed to coordinate and cohere elements of UK policy on north and South Sudan. Ambassadors, particularly Irfan Siddiq (in post 2018–21), have been prominent voices in support of democratic transition and civilian rule since 2018, often working within the Troika. UK diplomacy played an important role in the June–July 2019 “Quad” negotiations that produced the civilian-led transitional government following the ousting of Al-Bashir, as discussed below. The level of attention that UK ministers pay to Sudan fluctuates considerably, however. In a show of support for Hamdok, Dominic Raab visited Sudan as foreign secretary in January 2021. No senior minister has visited since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Trends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main UK diplomatic objectives at present appear to be to encourage a transition towards civilian rule while helping to maintain stability and mitigate humanitarian crisis. As detailed below, the UK provided strong diplomatic, financial and technical support to the transitional government until October 2021. Since that time, the UK has had ongoing contact with Sudan’s officials, including the chair of the now military government, General Al-Burhan, while stating that it is striving to prevent the normalisation of military rule. UK diplomats have lobbied to block Sudan’s access to international assistance and debt relief until a civilian-led government is restored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defence Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Sudan’s long period of military rule and the existence of UK, UN and EU sanctions regimes, opportunities for defence engagement have been few. Interviewees noted that from 2005 to the mid-2010s the UK MoD did establish a close working relationship with SAF officers through trainings, exchange visits and technical support up the level of Chief of Defence Staff. The AUHIP, active from 2009 to 2013, also provided a framework for UK engagement on defence matters. Respondents point out that it allowed for a UK defence attaché to be seconded to it, and enabled language training to be provided to Sudanese officers as an entry point for diplomacy at what was in other ways a difficult time for UK–Sudan relations. In comparison, however, South Sudan received a larger UK investment in its nascent military, the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (as it then was).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Trends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK–Sudan defence engagement was suspended after the October 2021 coup. The MoD withdrew its in-country defence attaché from Khartoum in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-overview-of-selected-outcomes&quot;&gt;II. Overview of Selected Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter highlights a number of outcomes that UK action has contributed towards in Sudan, whether through international development cooperation, defence engagement or diplomacy. The chapter draws on interviews to identify examples from among the UK’s wider portfolio of work as set out in Chapter I. While seen as broadly successful by interlocutors, the examples are used to identify and analyse key factors that have enabled or constrained UK attempts to further its “Global Britain” agenda, for example by showing leadership, responding quickly, cultivating partnerships or linking development, defence, diplomacy and trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;debt-relief-and-economic-reform&quot;&gt;Debt Relief and Economic Reform&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By early 2019, Sudan’s long-running economic difficulties had precipitated a political crisis. Catapulted to power in August, the civilian-led transitional government faced an enormous debt burden, inflation and a weak currency. Decades of economic mismanagement had created fiscal and current account deficits, sustained by excessive monetisation of the budget. The country was close to hyperinflation and experiencing acute shortages of essential commodities. The new civilian leaders attempted to leverage Western capitals’ hope that they would introduce rapid reforms to access debt relief, loans and grants as they embarked on economic reforms. A programme was agreed with the IMF which, it was assumed, would increase foreign currency income, settle the currency and eventually secure debt relief. In return, donors and international financial institutions (IFIs) required drastic fiscal measures. It was made clear to the transitional government that eliminating fuel and wheat subsidies costing around 12% of GDP would be key to securing debt relief. The programme was also designed to enable a sixfold public sector wage increase and the establishment of a “social safety net” programme. Despite opposition from elements of the “street” and some political parties (for example, the Communist Party), IFIs and Western donors were strongly supportive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on technical work carried out in 2011 under AUHIP auspices with support from British economic advisers, the UK played an important role in building consensus among international partners around proposed economic reforms and debt relief. As interviewees noted, the Friends of Sudan group initially displayed divergent positions – helping Sudan to re-engage with IFIs was not a priority for everyone. The UK helped to get agreement among donors on ensuring fiscal and political space for the reform agenda and encouraged others to engage early with the transitional government. Germany sponsored a Sudan Partnership Conference in Berlin in June 2020, at which around €1.6 billion was pledged. This in turn allowed the IMF to agree a 12-month Staff-Monitored Program, tied to a macroeconomic and structural reform agenda, to release future loans. A multi-country effort was then led by the UK under its G7 presidency to fund clearance of Sudan’s longstanding debt arrears to the IMF, the World Bank and the African Development Bank (ADB), which according to interview sources totalled $2.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK aid was used to simultaneously embed experts within Sudan’s Finance and National Economy Ministry and provide support to the government’s strategic communications (of which more below). The immediate results were in many ways remarkable. As interviews pointed out, the obstacles to progress on debt relief were more political than technical and Sudan met IMF requirements in record time and in 2020, concessional IFI finance of up to $2.5 billion was unlocked for the first time in 30 years. By June 2021, Sudan had qualified for Stage One debt relief under the HIPC debt relief scheme. It had qualified in historically short time. Respondents felt this was due in large part to the UK’s combined diplomatic and technical assistance. It was also noted that as part of this process, UK ministers agreed to provide a bridging loan so that Sudan could begin to clear its debts to the ADB through the debt relief process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK became the largest bilateral donor to a restructured World Bank trust fund (close to £80 million was allocated over two years, second to the EU’s contribution in terms of size), earmarking its support for a “Family Support” (cash transfer) project. The stated purpose of this project was to mitigate the political and economic fallouts from the structural economic adjustments required for debt relief, and address concerns raised by the Sudanese “street” about possible negative effects on public services or the cost of living. But the success seen on debt relief was not mirrored here. Envisaged as a rolling project funded by donors but delivered via Sudan’s finance ministry working in tandem with the World Food Programme, it was designed to provide an initial cash transfer worth $5 per person to 80% of Sudanese households (around 8 million families). By September 2021, however, only around 1 million households were recorded as having received payments. Interviewees pointed to a combination of IFI institutional bureaucracy, the limited bureaucratic capacity of the finance ministry and a slow response by donors as leading to project funding falling below initial expectations, arriving late and under-delivered. The Family Support Project had been conceived as a way of mitigating the negative effects of removing the fuel and wheat subsidies that were draining the country’s budget. It was also seen as helping to rebuild the social contract between government and population that had been so damaged by previous governments. In reality, the finance ministry did not have the societal reach nor capacity to deliver as envisaged. Respondents felt that in spite of donor funding for strategic communications, the civilian-led government performed poorly on communicating the linked issues of budgeting, family support, currency and subsidy reforms to a weary public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above problems might have been mitigated by better strategic coordination among donors. But a few respondents argued that more forceful dealings with IFI institutions at points – realistically, this would have required US leadership – could have ensured that multi-donor disbursement mechanisms worked better and quicker. They noted that the project was largely shelved following the October 2021 coup, with $350 million left unspent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there were disagreements between the office of the prime minister and the finance ministry on the pace of reform, respondents felt that painful fiscal measures had nevertheless been enacted by mid-2021 prior to the coup. As subsidies on key commodities such as fuel were lifted, prices spiked. By December, year-on-year inflation stood at 318%, driven both by subsidy removal and by the changing exchange rate. The price of wheat tripled in the year to September 2021. A few respondents suggested that the Sudanese pound showed some indications that it might stabilise, but it was no easier to borrow on international markets nor to purchase commodities. Hoped-for international loans and grants were also not arriving at scale – in the first three quarters of 2021, Sudan’s central bank reported that grants and loans fell to $80 million, around a quarter of the 2020 total. The reforms did reduce Sudan’s overall balance-of-payments deficit. Consumer prices also began to fall, around seven months after the fuel subsidy removal. But while the subsidy removal had likely reduced the printing of money, the fall may largely be attributable to lower imports of now unaffordable wheat and fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consensus among Western donors, IFIs and elements in the transitional government that emerged between 2019 and 2021 on key economic reforms, principally currency flotation, subsidy removal and public sector wage adjustments, did not extend to the “street” or to a number of political figures. Support from military elements for what were in practice a set of medium-term austerity measures was probably situation-specific. With civilians fronting the reforms, the military elements within government could stand somewhat aloof and allow the civilian technocrats to take most of the political flak. As the reforms further eroded living standards, ongoing tensions between different governmental factions had increased. In hindsight, interviews suggested that by pushing the reforms through, finance minister Gibril Ibrahim, chair of the Islamist Justice and Equality Movement armed group, which had entered government via the Juba Peace Agreement, helped to craft a narrative around a failing civilian transition prior to the 2021 coup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example of UK engagement with Sudan’s debt relief and economic reform raises a number of issues. On the one hand, it shows the UK demonstrating leadership, working with allies and multilaterals, and combining technical expertise with diplomacy. Yet it also raises very difficult questions about close donor alignment with a contentious – if economically orthodox – set of policies that many in Sudan opposed, including the “street”. While planning for reforms was underway, the UK supported the government of Sudan to design and deliver a nationwide awareness campaign to sensitise its citizens to the economic situation and prepare people for the proposed reforms. Respondents noted that, along with others, the UK also funded roundtable discussions, a conference and training for a number of Sudanese journalists to discuss the economic reform agenda. Respondents pointed out, however, that such inputs could not have forged anything like a public consensus in the time available, while the benefits of unlocking international finance were not realised prior to the military takeover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As interviewees noted, a key assumption of all donor support to Sudan’s transition in those years that now appears questionable was that what was in fact a weak political centre could successfully enact these far-reaching changes. To do so would have meant securing support from stronger institutions (the SAF, the RSF, armed groups, the Native Administration), oligarchs and regional powers, and what respondents pointed out was a notoriously dysfunctional civil service charged with delivering the accompanying social safety net programme. The post-October 2021 military government did not reverse the fuel subsidy cut or currency liberalisation introduced by their civilian predecessors. They also sought to restart talks on IFI loans and debt relief. But the extent to which the immediate societal costs of reforms enacted under the civilian-led government provided military actors with a narrative around civilian incompetence seems to respondents to have been underappreciated. In hindsight, timing was also a crucial factor. Had fiscal and debt relief efforts been initiated earlier, or changes introduced at a different tempo, the politics might have been easier. The US insistence on a quid pro quo for debt relief and loans linked to the Abraham Accords meant, however, that the pace of events was not within the control of most donors, including the UK. (Under the Trump administration, the US required Sudan to normalise relations with Israel in return for removal from its State Sponsors of Terrorism list and to progress debt relief and World Bank loans.) Nevertheless, respondents argued that in this case donors focused too single-mindedly on fiscal issues, to the detriment of a wider set of linked political questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;humanitarian-relief&quot;&gt;Humanitarian Relief&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK support for humanitarian relief has been a longstanding commitment in Sudan dating back to the second civil war of 1983–2005. Some of the achievements reported by the UK from its humanitarian work in Sudan in recent years include: 1.2 million people with sustainable access to clean water and/or sanitation by 2018; 589,000 children under five, women and adolescent girls reached through food- and nutrition-related interventions; and more than 500,000 vulnerable children provided with free school meals in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial commitments have been substantial. The most recent large-scale UK aid programme, Responding to Protracted Crisis in Sudan: Humanitarian Reform, Assistance and Resilience Programme (HRAR), cost approximately £250 million from 2017 to 2022. It reached more than 2 million people, providing food aid, cash and voucher transfers, education, primary healthcare and water access, while attempting to strengthen the long-term resilience of more than 890,000 people.76 The programme also helped to fund a “conflict sensitivity facility”, intended as a resource for the wider humanitarian community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HRAR’s overarching objectives on reform of humanitarian relief are based on the UN-led “Grand Bargain” agreement to which the UK is a signatory, and include greater transparency, better needs assessments and localisation of support. The end-of-term FCDO programme review of HRAR reported “good” or “partial” progress on these objectives. Improvements on information management and agency transparency have been marked, and substantial progress recorded towards localisation targets, on increasing cash transfers, and on humanitarian agencies conducting joint needs assessments. More specifically, transparency has improved, with the online publication of data by the UN Sudan Humanitarian Fund, and better-quality reporting by bilateral donors. Progress on more timely and effective humanitarian responses has been slower, partly attributed by interviewees to a restrictive operating context. To the regret of some implementing partners, objectives for linking humanitarian relief to longer-term development work will not be met, since the embassy has deprioritised the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HRAR also funded technical advisers and programme officers within the UN system to work on nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, physical protection (including from gender-based violence) and cash grants, and to play technical or coordination roles within the UN Resident Coordinator’s office. Respondents see this as having added capacity to the wider system and enhanced the UK’s profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As respondents noted, the majority of UK humanitarian work is carried out day to day by technical staff who, for example, administer funding or try to support the humanitarian “cluster system” and implementing partners. Meanwhile, higher-level influencing work falls to the UK development director, who seeks to influence other donor and agency leads from the UN Humanitarian Country Team to the office of the UN’s humanitarian and “resident” coordinators, who are in charge of overall system coordination, and international humanitarian non-governmental organisations. Together with the Netherlands, the UK also chairs the humanitarian donor group. UK diplomatic staff, including those in New York and Geneva, have long supported these efforts. Interviewees, however, point to diplomats in-country now feeling increased ownership of humanitarian issues following the creation of the merged FCDO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An issue that UK diplomats and development staff at different levels report having grappled with continuously is improving humanitarian “access”. Sudanese governments have long frustrated aid delivery through a complex web of permits, bureaucratic delays, security protocols and financial demands via their – security-influenced – Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC). At the time of writing, the Dutch and UK co-chairs of the humanitarian donor group were said by respondents to be making representations to the government of Sudan on behalf of donors in an attempt to resolve key issues. The UK, among others, was credited with injecting realism into what can at times be overly theoretical donor discussion on such questions. HAC requirements and other impediments to humanitarian access were somewhat relaxed during the transitional government’s tenure, but interviews point to them having returned in force quickly after the 2021 coup, as figures from the Al-Bashir era were swiftly returned to their former posts and revived previous policies. In the meantime, no major combined effort had been mounted in the interim by donors or the UN to address deeper issues of government and security forces’ interference with humanitarian access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example of humanitarian relief shows the UK working effectively and showing leadership on challenging issues with partners and multilaterals in Sudan. Some targets have not been met, and opportunities to adopt a new approach towards access restrictions may have been missed. Yet the embassy has been effective in linking together programme funding, technical assistance and diplomacy. There are no indications that past UK engagement on defence has provided an entry point for access discussions. Interviewees felt that the UK’s prominence on humanitarian issues has, however, given it influence and offered entry points for wider discussions on aid and political and security matters. Whether influence can be maintained at current levels is an open question. Many suspect not – interviewees note that implementing partners are less inclined to approach embassy staff than in the past, due to uncertainties over funding. The UK has traditionally been the largest donor to the UN-run Sudan Humanitarian Fund, at points contributing more than 50% of funds. While the UK remains on the Fund’s advisory board, currently the US, Germany and the Netherlands make larger contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;crisis-response-2019-coup-and-2021-counter-coup&quot;&gt;Crisis Response: 2019 Coup and 2021 Counter-Coup&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just prior to the coup of October 2021, the Sudanese military hoarded commodities and fomented unrest. A street “protest” calling for a military takeover was organised in Khartoum on 16 October, presumably to test the resolve of international actors. At this point, the UK embassy moved into “crisis watch” mode, in line with its crisis management plan. This was one step below “crisis mode”, indicating that embassy priorities had shifted away from business as usual and were focused on unfolding political events. After two days with no further events to respond to and the transitional government still apparently in charge, the embassy stepped out of crisis watch mode and reverted to business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coup of 25 October first unfolded on social media. The embassy was alerted by London 30 minutes prior to a communications blackout in Khartoum. This was enough time, however, to allow the local crisis team to convene, for roles to be assigned and for initial measures ranging from a telephone tree to regular situation reports to be put in place. Over the subsequent days and weeks, the crisis team handled a variety of operational, programmatic and diplomatic questions ranging from staff and family welfare to updating travel advice for UK citizens, amending programme spend and agreeing messaging towards the de facto government. Scenarios under which UK non-essential staff would “draw down” to the UK were considered and prepared for, but not enacted. After a six-week public internet blackout the situation in-country became more routine. The embassy stayed in full crisis mode for around a month, before reducing the response level to “crisis watch” until April 2022. A lessons identification exercise was then carried out which praised the response, noting the value of the “whole-of-mission approach” that had been adopted, and the swift actions taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the UK’s response to the changes of spring 2019 drew some criticism. Western embassies did not act early in advance of Al-Bashir’s ousting, despite a build-up of tension. Viewed from today, his removal in mid-2019 may have an air of inevitability, coming as it did after years of mounting political and economic pressure. At the time, however, there was anything but a consensus among observers in general or Western embassies in particular, who had seen protests many times before. The then UK ambassador has been credited with warning both London and diplomatic colleagues that the wave of protests could be consequential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite coordination efforts among donors, some observers felt that multilateral and Western donors’ efforts to hurriedly mount programmes of support for the incoming transitional administration in 2019 and 2020 were either ineffective or duplicative. According to interviewees, the EU and the UK gave strategic communications support to the office of the prime minister, while the UN provided equipment. Yet for reasons explored earlier, the civilian government leadership was chaotic, divided and indecisive on some critical and difficult issues. From this perspective it is far from clear that improved donor offerings on communications support would have remedied the situation. Respondents pointed to the limited quantity of UK technical and programmatic assistance, which appeared modest in comparison to the scale of the challenge and Western rhetoric at the time. The extent of economic bailout required by this point was truly daunting, requiring both IFI and bilateral financing, and for the US leadership to lift its sanctions regime and Saudi Arabia and the UAE to provide bridging loans. Unfortunately, in the case of the UK, although it was possible to advance the debt relief agenda, especially work on the Paris Club and IFI engagement, political turmoil at home linked to Brexit, among other things, resulted in little attention for Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interview findings point to the UK having played a critical political role in spring and summer 2019, managing to combine public pro-democracy messaging from the ambassador with acting as a bridge to the US, and bringing the Gulf states, the AU and IGAD into broad agreement on a transitional arrangement. This meant marshalling the Quad to ensure that the Sudanese military, having taken over control from the National Congress Party in April 2019, handed over to a fresh (transitional) administration as set out in what became a Constitutional Charter. Although IGAD and the AU took credit for the handover, the UK’s role was said to have been significant in bringing the Quad powers to a shared position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few respondents questioned the fundamental approach that Western actors took to economic reform. In practice, this involved aligning with a relatively small number of FFC coalition ministers and advisers and providing technical support to the finance ministry and the prime minister’s office in relation to milestones for macroeconomic reform and institution building. The politics of the economic reforms were apparently discussed among donors, and attempts – such as the Family Support Project – were made to manage the anticipated impact on households. Yet serious questions remain about the effectiveness of these measures, the speed with which the reforms were pursued, and the way that divergent opinions about them were managed. Alternative approaches might, for example, have been to prioritise developing a nuanced understanding of different political constituencies’ calculations, contradictions and weaknesses. A few respondents argued that foregrounding the politics of reform over the (technical) economic questions might have helped donors to navigate a protracted political struggle and gradually develop a long-term democratisation strategy. More fundamentally, many international and Sudanese analysts believe that the diplomatic community made a mistake in urging the FFC to accept a hybrid civilian–military government. In this view, civilian campaigners should have pursued the sidelining of military actors, particularly after the 3 June massacre. How these alternative approaches might have affected attempts to secure debt relief and IFI loan access for Sudan, and whether they would eventually have led to civilian control of military–economic assets or not, are unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-enablers-and-constraints-key-findings&quot;&gt;III. Enablers and Constraints: Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explores the role of six factors that either enabled or constrained UK action in Sudan in recent years: operating context; resourcing; structures; strategy; leadership; and relationships. These have been identified through interviews and by exploring the nature of the UK’s contribution to the above outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operating-context&quot;&gt;Operating Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sudan has presented a challenging context for external actors for decades. It has seen intercommunal conflict, displacement and insurgencies, accusations of support for terrorism, genocide and war crimes, and widespread hunger. The UK’s responses have included participation in a framework of economic sanctions against key government figures that made the bilateral relationship more difficult. In turn, the government of Sudan has sought to limit the movement of Western diplomats within the country and curtailed humanitarian aid delivery, which it sees as political.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The period since 2019 has, however, been unusually turbulent. The political revolution of spring 2019 and the massacre in June of civilians by security forces was followed by only nine months of relative normality, before the Covid-19 pandemic and later resumption of street protests and government crackdowns culminated in the military coup of October 2021. Since then, violence, hunger and displacement have unfortunately spread to new parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this is a highly challenging context in which to pursue objectives around poverty reduction, humanitarian relief, development, stability and migration. The political environment is now one in which constitutional provisions are unclear, government-to-government relations cannot easily be formalised, and popular movements, regional powers and the use of force play a key role. Changes in Sudan occurred while Ethiopia, South Sudan and Somalia were also experiencing instability, alongside the common experience of Covid-19 and, more recently, rising food and fuel prices associated with the Ukraine war. Interviews indicate that these wider events have tested the UK government’s plans and resources. Any assessment of the UK’s overall effectiveness and progress with the “Global Britain” agenda needs to be made against this unusually challenging backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resourcing&quot;&gt;Resourcing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the particularities of UK–Sudan relations, with fraught diplomatic relations and a limited trading relationship, ODA has been the main resource at the UK’s disposal. However, interviewees felt that cuts to the UK’s aid budget had not yet been seriously detrimental. One explanation for this could be that Sudan tends to receive smaller aid allocations in absolute terms than neighbouring Kenya, Ethiopia or Somalia. Moreover, the leading budget item – humanitarian aid contributions – though reduced, has been better protected than development spending, which was paused following the October 2021 coup. The picture is also complicated by the UK bilateral aid budget having been temporarily increased (by £80 million) to fund the Family Support Project, prior to the October 2021 coup. The UK’s humanitarian implementing partners are of a different view, however, as interviews suggested that they expect UK influence to wane as the country “brings less to the table”, and some feel this is already happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement of a move down to 0.5% GNI aid targets in 2019 also ushered in a period of ongoing uncertainty about aid budgets. By mid-March 2022, the FCDO’s budget for the financial year 2022–23 for Sudan was not set, making it difficult to plan and maintain good external relations. As respondents pointed out, predictability means that partners’ expectations cannot easily be managed, and long-term planning is impossible. A few interviewees stated that uncertainty over funding allocations has given the UK a reputation as an unreliable donor in Sudan. A number of humanitarian implementing partners are now said to be deprioritising the UK as a donor and seeking funds elsewhere&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty around UK aid cuts affected not only bilateral but also discretionary multi-donor programmes. The EU delegation to Sudan reported during interviews that it had to scale back delivery and delay long-awaited additional work in light of announced UK cuts. Since 2019 the military has followed the National Congress Party government’s practice of using cash loans from the Gulf to maintain power, but, as informed respondents pointed out, these do not compare in scale to the large-scale grants, loans and debt relief that Western influence can secure from IFIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One positive resourcing issue is that FCDO staffing levels, although low, have been maintained in spite of programme cuts. This has been good not only for delivery but also reputation – externals who were intervieweed still consider UK technical expertise and political analysis a strong asset. An exception is the departure in late 2022 of the permanent UK defence attaché to Sudan. The MoD concluded, after months of waiting, that without any moves to reintroduce civilians into government, it could no longer justify maintaining the position permanently following the October 2021 coup, as that event represented a block to meaningful UK cooperation with the SAF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Khartoum embassy was not immune to the “process” fatigue that afflicted FCDO globally as a result of the DFID-FCO merger. A carefully managed local merger process does appear, however, to have taken the edge off this. The UK’s relatively small staff footprint in Sudan probably facilitated the merger, with few pre-existing teams and “silos”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategy&quot;&gt;Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews suggested that Sudanese who are familiar with the UK’s day-to-day diplomatic, defence and development engagement tend to see it as broadly coherent, and often give the UK credit for navigating the turbulent waters since 2018 with some success. But interviewees remarked that it is increasingly common to hear complaints about a lack of clear vision for Sudan beyond “transition”. Some reflected that the UK is struggling to play a decisive leadership role as it remains torn between different assumptions and strategies. In this view, the UK’s vocal support for a political transition is positive but not sufficient, and better articulation is needed of the relationship between restoring stability, achieving democratisation and reducing conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it can be argued that a desire for stability in Sudan has shaped a UK policy that pursues elite settlements (for example, the 2020 Juba Peace Agreement and the 2005 CPA) that have been in tension with wider democratisation. Core elements of Sudan’s military, security and pro-Islamist establishment are intransigent and pitted in a zero-sum game against democratisation. Respondents noted that Western interests include a desire to be seen as working with and through a region (IGAD members and Gulf states) that includes governments that are not necessarily keen to promote democratisation. If the UK lacks a consistent strategy and vision here, it is, however, in company with arguably all Western states and multilaterals. These criticisms would extend to many others, including the UNITAMS “Trilateral Mechanism”, which is geared towards compromise. Yet given recent events, even a minimalist “pro-stability” agenda must now grapple with accruing evidence that military rule and associated economic predation is in fact the principal source of Sudan’s instability. From this perspective, as critical respondents argued, continuity will not bring stability. Rather, any future compromise settlement between military and civilian reformers will ultimately fail. In turn, this implies that Western actors should therefore develop red lines and strategies to help Sudan navigate potential future transitions or uprisings, at the same time exploring options to influence regional actors and build coherence among bottom-up social forces that might eventually shift power dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structures&quot;&gt;Structures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As interviewees pointed out, in Whitehall, legacy DFID and FCO Africa departments were gradually merged into one shared structure in 2021–22. Creating new structures and working relationships has apparently been less difficult than adjusting other business processes. Across the FCDO, existing business processes have had to be revised repeatedly as merger activities have run concurrently with a series of ministerial and leadership changes, restructuring in London, and iterative aid cuts. Respondents cited the successive changes as having slowed down delivery and decision-making and testing staff morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 2020 merger announcement, the Khartoum embassy began scoping out issues and options for delivering the merger of separate FCO and DFID teams and processes. According to interviews, by early 2021, a change-management process was underway, led by the deputy head of mission. The merger was felt to be disruptive by many, and a good many former DFID staff are said to have been demotivated by its prospect. Running a self-conscious change-management process in Khartoum may, however, have limited staff frustration and increased buy-in. Embassy staff were eventually structured into two “joint” teams, one focused on intra-Sudan issues, the other on external issues. Interviewees reported that corporate messaging is more unified now, and dealings with government easier to coordinate. Others reported that ambassadorial oversight of the UK’s portfolio of work in the country has improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews showed that Sudanese with close ties to the UK – for example, aid workers, sections of academia, business people and journalists – were very aware of DFID’s closure and the creation of the FCDO. Among this constituency, most did not expect the UK’s reputation to suffer as a result of the merger. In contrast to countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya, it appears from interviews that people in Sudan have more of a connection with the “UK” brand than with “DFID” specifically, perhaps as a result of the UK’s independent profile on peace mediation linked to its role in the Troika.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some observers felt that, following the merger, the UK’s development work was increasingly being seen through the lens of Sudan’s politics – an appropriate approach for the country. On the other hand, external partners noted a reduced focus by the FCDO on linking humanitarian relief efforts to development, once a prominent concern for DFID. It was unclear from the interviews, however, whether this is a consequence of the DFID–FCO merger, aid cuts, or other pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leadership&quot;&gt;Leadership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews suggest that political instability in the UK, with high rates of ministerial turnover and questions around integrity, has left many Sudanese doubtful about UK leadership. Periodic clampdowns on African migration to the UK, the recent proposed arrangement to send asylum applicants to be processed and resettled in Rwanda, work permit restrictions and reports of worsening living conditions in the West are also negatively influencing attitudes towards the UK and the West. UK ministerial attention to Sudan has reduced from previous years, with no senior ministers visiting since 2021. This has been noticed in Sudan. Although there is a large constituency in favour of increased UK–Sudan engagement, the sense from interviews was that many expect UK engagement to diminish further as a result of a difficult economic situation in the UK and other concerns, including the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the examples above illustrate, the UK has built a range of useful relationships in Sudan, with multilateral organisations, like-minded bilaterals, regional powers and some elements in government, the military and civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK won both praise and blame for its coordination efforts during the transition period. On the positive side, UK officials played to the strengths of different partners in support of the transitional government, combining the UK’s own technical expertise with EU budgets and US leverage. The UK also influenced and supported the World Bank and the IMF around debt relief and reform. But as the examples above show, there were significant challenges associated with the overall approach taken by Western governments and IFIs during the 2019–21 transition period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from larger strategic questions, a few respondents recalled the UK’s attempts to establish a common framework for day-to-day donor interaction with the government of Sudan. Having taken ownership of this agenda prior to summer 2019, they felt that the UK failed to make any progress with this agenda, ultimately yielding to Sweden. Apparently limited progress was being made just prior to the October 2021 coup, when the issue was dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees suggested that a minority of Sudanese observers feel that the UK has lost traction as a result of leaving the EU. Most see the issue as being of marginal importance. Interviewees reported no insurmountable operational changes flowing from Brexit. UK officials no longer attend routine EU cooperation meetings (such as the EU Heads of Mission, Political Council, and Heads of Development Cooperation meetings), but are finding workarounds. Although UK influence over EU activity is now diminished, there are alternative coordination structures with which the UK has long worked successfully, including the Friends of Sudan, Troika and Quad groupings. According to interviewees, the UK has a reputation for collaborative working with all of these, but with the Troika and Quad in particular. Indeed, respondents felt that the UK has been able to move more quickly diplomatically, and to demonstrate sharper messaging, since Brexit. It is also true, however, that Brexit itself – alongside other political difficulties – consumed an unwelcome amount of the UK government’s time, particularly for the FCDO and ministers, at exactly the point when increased attention to Sudan’s political transition was needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sudanese reflections on Western international engagement tend to focus on either the Troika countries or the UNITAMS mission. Views differ between urban elites (professionals, FFC-affiliated political parties) on the one hand and the “street” and resistance committees on the other. A range of interviewees indicated that the former, for example, perceive UNITAMS as confused and ineffective, and although concerned that they may be too willing to countenance compromise with the military, see the Troika and other Western countries as allies. The “street”, however, is cynical about all international involvement in Sudan, and apparently expects the West to restore the military via a hybrid government in pursuit of stability. Interviewees consider Western influence to be in decline relative to that of states in the wider region. Sudan’s ruling elite now seems little concerned about Western governments’ opinions – the October 2021 coup came just days after the chair of the Sovereign Council, General Al-Burhan, assured the British ambassador, the UK special envoy for Sudan, the Africa minister, and the US envoy of his commitment to the hybrid transitional government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the UK is credited by respondents for its ongoing attempts to engage with regional and emerging powers, countries that past experience shows can decisively shape Sudan’s political direction. Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia are seen as the country’s most influential neighbours. Egypt has deep connections with the Sudanese military and Saudi Arabia has relied on substantial RSF troops to fight in Yemen. As interviewees pointed out, Saudi Arabia and the UAE also have close economic ties with Sudan that include investments in land and productive industries, while the UAE is a major exporter to the country. They also note that the UAE and Saudi Arabia are particularly known for chequebook diplomacy, having provided cash loans to past Sudanese governments. All three countries prefer dealing with the Sudanese military to Islamist rule or democratisation – largely a reflection of their domestic politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the UK also enjoys strong ties to the US at a time when the Abraham Accords coloured diplomacy with Gulf and Middle Eastern partners is also significant. The US recently appointed a new ambassador to Sudan, the first in many years. While still regarded as important, a visible donor and a sometimes strident political player, various interviewees saw the US as having declined in influence relative to others, including not only Gulf states but also Russia and China. For example, the Russian paramilitary organisation the Wagner Group has reportedly trained the RSF in exchange for gold. RSF leader General Hemedti has visited Moscow to discuss security cooperation – Russia being keen to secure a naval base in Sudan. A friendly Russia can influence UN mandates and voting on Sudanese affairs; likewise, Sudan abstained in March 2022 on UN votes on the Ukraine war. For its part, China maintains a stake in South Sudanese oil production and supplies cheap consumer goods to Sudan. Its investments overall are limited, however, and it is primarily concerned with regional stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s consistent use of envoys to Sudan since the time of the CPA negotiations in the early 2000s has contributed to successful UK diplomacy. Individuals have come and gone, but the post is seen as important by allies and Sudanese interlocutors. While also working on South Sudan, respondents noted that the role of the current UK Envoy to Sudan maintains a broad set of relationships with government, opposition, armed groups and external partners, and is seen as coordinating well with peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with animosities driven by sanctions and mutual condemnations, interviewees underscored that UK relations with the government of Sudan have often been strained, and contacts difficult to cultivate. At times, including following the October 2021 coup, London would not countenance formal government-to-government contact between UK and Sudanese officials. The level of UK access and influence in Sudan has fluctuated from cooperation on specific initiatives (for example, HIPC and the Khartoum Process) to close alignment with elements of the recent transitional government and periods of outright hostility under the NCP. Western influence in Sudan has varied according to the strength of the military. The Friends of Sudan and Troika groups both condemned the October coup, leaving them with reduced influence with the military. The stridency of the UK ambassador in condemning the 2021 coup – initially alone – was remarked upon by more than one interviewee. While the UK may enjoy decent relations with a hybrid or civilian government, it was suggested by interviewees that the Sudanese military now sees it as antagonistic. Perhaps it is no surprise then that accusations of UK hyprocisy surface periodically, and diplomats have long faced movement restrictions and bureaucratic hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of all this, a range of interviewees assessed that the UK has, overall, succeeded in maintaining access to Sudanese governments, even while being critical of current and previous regimes. Despite difficulties and criticisms, it seems from this research that a majority of Sudanese still view the UK as a supportive partner with a positive track record. A few respondents, Sudanese and international, who have observed the UK at work over time considered the government-to-government relationship to have been inescapably difficult but managed with some skill. Respondents underscored that, with some exceptions, Sudanese are on the whole affectionate towards the UK, believing there to be a special, albeit neglected, relationship between the two countries that has huge untapped potential. This creates a two-way expectation that the UK can and should “do more”. A key question in the months and years ahead will be whether the UK and like-minded actors are prepared to go beyond established relationships with political parties and the military, to embrace the messy but necessary business of interacting regularly with “the street”. From this perspective, understanding how to engage and, where possible, support pro-democracy campaigners, whether through, for example, small capacity-building initiatives, encouraging dialogue or strategising among campaign groups, should be more of a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has summarised findings on how the UK has sought to deliver positive change for Sudan as well as progress its “Global Britain” agenda through the use of development aid, defence engagement and diplomacy. It has looked in particular at the years since Brexit, during which the UK has made aid cuts and seen a brief fall in GDP and wider political and institutional changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK generally enjoys a good reputation in Sudan. This derives partly from diaspora and cultural ties and, for some, positive memories of the colonial era. It also, however, comes from the UK’s fairly consistent championing of civilian rule, conflict resolution and humanitarianism, which has led to it still being regarded in Sudan as a relevant actor, with worthwhile capabilities from skilled personnel to valuable aid contributions, and some measure of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK can claim substantial depth and quality of relationships both in Sudan and with regional actors. Its ability to operate in multiple forums, from New York to Khartoum and the region, including through the use of envoys, ambassadors, and political and aid specialists, is significant. Leaving the EU has had a marginal effect on the UK’s standing in Sudan. The merger of DFID and the FCO has absorbed time and energy, but the benefits of joined-up working are identifiable. The end of DFID does not appear to have had a marked effect, unlike cuts to the aid budget. These are most noticeable in relation to humanitarian delivery and partner confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of ongoing budget cuts and the rise of competitors, however, doubts now exist about the durability of UK influence. Interviewees expected UK influence to wane in the years ahead. Some expressed confusion or frustration that the former colonial power will not commit further resources. It is true that in resource terms – barring a brief increase in the 2019–20 UK aid budget linked to economic reform – the country has not been prioritised as suggested in the 2021 Integrated Review. The Ukraine war, the Covid-19 pandemic, budget cuts and turbulent UK politics have drawn time and money away from Sudan. As interviewees noted, the contemporary issue for many pro-democracy actors in Sudan, however, is a suspicion that the UK and Western allies will play a conservative hand in future, opting for political compromise in the hope of achieving stability. This would be despite the UK’s professed values and in the face of increasing evidence that the military grip is a key driver of Sudan’s instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, despite its many problems, Sudan presents challenges that the UK could help to address if ministers were prepared to offer a combination of technical leadership, targeted financing and support for political coalition-building. Alongside humanitarian relief and reform, areas of traditional UK expertise, from stabilisation to improving governance, security sector reform and economic development, will all be critical. The UK might, for example, find opportunities to convene like-minded actors interested in these issues, or it might seek to facilitate dialogue among disparate pro-democracy groups in the hope of avoiding the mistakes of the previous transitional government. To maximise its effectiveness, the UK should reflect on the significance of the enabling and constraining factors identified in this paper and identify gaps and lessons to be learned around its recent strategies and vision for a future Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官裁定所有不認罪被告表證成立 13人擬作供&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/I5eIwxr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）踏入審訊第64天。林卓廷、黃碧雲、何桂藍及吳政亨一方昨提出中段陳詞，申請毋須答辯，法官今裁定16名不認罪被告全部表證成立，各被告須答辯。其中除了吳政亨、余慧明及楊雪盈3人暫時料不作供外，其餘13名被告，包括鄭達鴻、梁國雄、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、林卓廷、施德來、何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、柯耀林、李予信均擬作供，預料主問需時約13天。法官李運騰指盤問或需主問的兩至三倍時間，法官陳慶偉預料辯方案情連盤問或需時共39天，但指不代表需用盡。案件下周一（12日）續審，料將開展辯方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官裁表證全成立-吳政亨余慧明楊雪盈擬不作供&quot;&gt;官裁表證全成立 吳政亨、余慧明、楊雪盈擬不作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林卓廷、黃碧雲、何桂藍及吳政亨一方昨提出中段陳詞，爭議被告行為不構成控罪的「非法手段」。法官聽取雙方陳詞後，今裁定所有不認罪被告表證成立，被告均須答辯，詳細理由押後頒布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方就會否傳召證人表達意向。代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘表示，吳政亨現時傾向不會作供，但會傳召兩名辯方證人，預料需時1.5小時，將分別就一段與吳政亨的錄音對話，及吳發出的電郵作供，並將相關文件呈堂；至於余慧明則沒有辯方案情。代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良亦表示，楊傾向不作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;13被告擬作供-部分或傳辯方證人&quot;&gt;13被告擬作供 部分或傳辯方證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其餘13名被告均表示擬作供，部分或傳召辯方證人。代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙表示，二人作供料需時約1天，或各傳召一名辯方證人。代表李予信的大律師關文渭表示，李作供料需時半天，另傳召1名事實證人，並會呈交部分文件。代表施德來的大律師黃廷光表示，施將作供，或傳召1名辯方證人，料需時2天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於其他被告均不會傳召辯方證人。代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀表示，彭作供料需時少於1天，並會呈交一些區議會文件。代表何啟明的大律師阮偉明表示，何料需時2至3小時。自行代表的劉偉聰預料需少於2小時。代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文亦指二人料需時約2小時。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 表示，何料需時2天。代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉、代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑和代表柯耀林的大律師唐樂山，均指其當事人料需時約1天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉總結，辯方案情預料需13至14天。法官李運騰笑指盤問至少會如主問般長，「若不是雙倍時間，就需3倍時間」，因控方應有頗多文件要向被告發問。法官陳仲衡亦指，部分辯方律師或需向其他被告作出盤問。陳慶偉指，假設辯方案情需13天，再加上盤問的26天，辯方案情或需共39天，但指那不代表需用盡該39天時間。李運騰笑說即還要多審兩個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押至下周一（12日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方爭議被告行為不構成「非法手段」 要求裁定林卓廷等表證不成立&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eDM6JQg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，踏入審訊第63天。林卓廷、黃碧雲、何桂藍及吳政亨一方作出中段陳詞，要求法庭裁定表證不成立，被告毋須答辯，法官押至周五（9日）下決定。本案被告被控串謀以「非法手段」顛覆國家政權，辯方爭議「非法手段」在《國安法》下無清晰定義，而案發時政府尚未通過公職人員宣誓修例，將「無差別反對政府議案」列為「不屬」擁護《基本法》及效忠特區的行為，故當時否決預算案不構成「非法手段」。控方則指，上述條文雖於2021年5月始生效，惟僅就現行法例作出闡釋，認為被告濫用《基本法》權力迫使政府妥協仍屬「非法手段」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦認為，控方除無差別否決預算案，亦須證明被告有意圖迫使特首解散立法會及下台，惟現時證據不足；控方則認為毋須就所有控罪詳情舉證。而就辯方稱林卓廷於選舉論壇提及政府派3萬元便會贊成預算案，控方反駁林僅迴避問題，而該黨立場實同意否決預算案，以避免被邊緣化。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指控罪詳情全屬串謀公開作為-辯方指屬控罪元素須全部舉證&quot;&gt;控方指控罪詳情全屬串謀「公開作為」 辯方指屬「控罪元素」須全部舉證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官上周五裁定「共謀者原則」不適用於《國安法》生效前言行，控方案情完結，林卓廷、黃碧雲、吳政亨及何桂藍一方今作出中段陳詞，要求法庭裁定控罪表證不成立，被告毋須答辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;雙方早前呈交書面陳詞，今作口頭補充，並主要就控罪詳情列明的「非法手段」，及控方須舉證的控罪元素等作爭議。本案指控各被告串謀以「非法手段」嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港特區政權機關依法履行職能，並於控罪詳情列出4項行為，包括濫用職權無差別否決預算案，以迫使特首解散立法會及下台等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;被告被控在2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日，在香港一同串謀及與其他人串謀，旨在顛覆國家政權而組織、策劃、實施或者參與實施，以威脅使用武力或其他非法手段，即：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（i）為以下目的宣揚、進行或參與一個謀劃，旨在濫用其在當選立法會議員後根據《基本法》第73條所受託的職權；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（a）在立法會取得大多數控制權，藉以對香港特區政府提出的任何財政預算或公共開支，不論當中內容或內容的利弊如何，均不予區別拒絕通過；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（b）迫使香港特區政府根據《基本法》第50條解散立法會，從而癱瘓政府運作；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（c）最終導致行政長官因立法會解散和重選的立法會拒絕通過原財政預算案而根據《基本法》第52條而辭職；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（ii）為達致該謀劃，參選或不參選立法會選舉，及/或促致、煽動、引致、誘使他人參選或不參選該選舉；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（iii）承諾或同意當選立法會議員後，及/或煽動、促使、引致、誘使他人當選立法會議員後，在審核或通過政府提出的財政預算或公共開支時，按照該謀劃，行使或不行使其根據《基本法》第73條所訂的職權；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（iv）承諾或同意在該選舉中當選後，及/或煽動、促使、引致、誘使他人在該選舉中當選後，故意或蓄意不履行，或故意或蓄意疏於履行其立法會議員職責，即擁護《基本法》，效忠中華人民共和國香港特別行政區，盡忠職守，遵守法律，廉潔奉公，為香港特別行政區服務；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港特別行政區政權機關依法履行職能的行為。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷及黃碧雲的大律師沈士文爭議，就控罪列出（i）至（iv）的行為，均是控方全須舉證的「控罪元素」，而非僅用來推論串謀協議存在、毋須舉證的「公開作為」（overt acts）；又指除了無差別否決預算案，控方亦須證明被告意圖迫使特首解散立法會和下台，才足以證明案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wvpdrfn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃碧雲（左）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟副刑事檢控專員萬德豪反駁，何者屬「公開作為」和「控罪元素」是由控方而非辯方判斷，而控方一直主張該4項行為全屬毋須舉證的「公開作為」，對被告無造成不公；又指本案控罪詳情頗長，難以想像控方要將控罪書每一隻字都毫無合理疑點舉證。萬又強調，控方於修訂的開案陳詞已列明屬「核心議題（core matter）」的控罪詳情，即同意無差別否決預算案以迫使特首解散立法會及下台，旨在顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方政府僅於前年修法列明無差別否決議案違法-被告行為不構成非法手段&quot;&gt;辯方：政府僅於前年修法列明無差別否決議案違法 被告行為不構成「非法手段」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦爭議，《國安法》沒有清晰定義何謂「非法手段」。沈士文稱，政府為了填補這個法律定義的空白（vacuum），才在案發後的2021年5月通過《2021年公職（參選及任職）（雜項修訂）條例草案》，於《釋義及通則條例》新增第3AA條「對擁護《基本法》和效忠特區的提述」，該條例於5月21日刊憲生效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當中列明「不屬」擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特區的行為，包括第3AA(3)(f)的「作出損害或有傾向損害《基本法》中以行政長官為主導的政治體制秩序的行為」，其中一項為「無差別地反對特區政府提出的議案，並（A）意圖以此要脅特區政府；（B）意圖以此使特區政府無法正常履行職務和職能；或（C）意圖以此逼使行政長官下台及推翻特區政府」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈認為，該條文並無追溯力，因此被告於案發時、即條文通過前作出相關行為，並不屬「非法手段」。代表吳政亨的大律師梁麗幗亦表示，該條文內容此前並無在《基本法》或任何香港法例列明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方被告具不良動機和濫用基本法權力亦屬非法涉發假誓&quot;&gt;控方：被告具不良動機和濫用《基本法》權力亦屬非法、涉發假誓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過控方引用黎智英申請永久終止聆訊的高院判詞，指該新條文只是陳述明顯的事實（state the obvious）、就現行法例給出定義，沒有就《國安法》或《基本法》新增任何內容。萬德豪又舉例，被告協議立會過半後以否決預算案為籌碼、迫使政府妥協，問從常理而言會否說是合法？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續引「程介南案」，指立會議員即使是行使其職權，但具不良動機和濫權仍被定罪，而本案被告正是濫用《基本法》賦予的權力顛覆國家政權。他又強調，「非法」是一個很闊的概念，除刑事行為外亦包括「違憲」行為，舉例被告當選後須宣誓擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特區，但基於他們的串謀協議，他們必然會干犯發假誓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱除無差別否決-同須證被告圖迫特首解散立會及下台-惟證據不足&quot;&gt;辯方稱除無差別否決 同須證被告圖迫特首解散立會及下台 惟證據不足&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續回應，明顯地《釋義及通則條例》第3AA(3)(f)條是因本案才新增，而控方開案陳詞列明本案的關鍵元素亦與該條文（A）至（C）的行為相符，可見控方嘗試應用該新法例。沈續指，假若該條文真如控方所說，其內容早於2020年7月1日已存在於現行法律，則控方除了須證明被告同意無差別否決預算案，亦要證明被告意圖迫使特首解散立法會及下台；惟沈指相關證據不足，即使將控方案情推到最高，充其量只能說其當事人同意否決，但非無差別否決，因此應裁定表證不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱非法手段須包含武力威脅元素&quot;&gt;辯方稱非法手段須包含武力威脅元素&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 亦爭議，何謂「非法手段」無清楚定義、控方無足夠證據證明被告行為是非法，現時「只因控方說是非法就假設是非法」，甚至沒有傳召憲制專家就此作證，批評控方案情有漏洞，「單單說是濫權不代表是濫權」。他亦認為「非法手段」應包含具威脅使用武力的元素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/S9mfR8L.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟李運騰質疑是否合憲是由法庭決定，毋須傳召專家；陳慶偉亦指區諾軒也談及無差別否決預算案的後果是特首解散立法會及下台。惟 Beel 指那並非必然發生，指行政長官不一定解散立會。李運騰指他不明白，指若預算案不獲通過，政府或缺乏撥款運作，包括不能支付法官的薪金和法援等，「除了解散立法會，還能怎樣解決這個死局？」Beel 回應那就需政治的操作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方林卓廷論壇稱會贊成財案僅迴避問題免dq-民主黨不主張否決財案會遭邊緣化&quot;&gt;控方：林卓廷論壇稱會贊成財案僅迴避問題免DQ 民主黨不主張否決財案會遭邊緣化&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就針對各被告的證據，辯方指林卓廷於選舉論壇曾表示若政府向每名市民派3萬元會贊成財政預算案，可見他無意無差別否決。惟控方不同意，指「派3萬元」與一整份預算案無法相比、即使否決了政府也能如常運作，認為林只是很巧妙地迴避會否「攬炒」或否決預算案的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於林被搜得的「初選Debate Notes」，提及「財政預算案會否投反對？胡志偉一再公開回應話會積極運用。況且，其實我立法會四年沒有贊成過財政預算案」，辯方爭議無證據顯示由林準備及使用。惟控方不同意，指前民主黨主席胡志偉在論壇上曾稱該黨同意否決預算案，前副主席尹兆堅亦指該黨願簽「墨落無悔」、只是不願簽無限民間聲明，而黃碧雲在論壇亦如林的筆記般，引述胡志偉稱該黨會否決財案，控方直言該黨立場頗為一致。李運騰一度指法庭已裁定「共謀者原則」不適用於《國安法》前言行，控方能否如此引他人言論，惟萬指並非引用該原則，而胡志偉言論是否代表民主黨立場會交由法庭裁斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬又指，黃碧雲和林卓廷當時均是民主黨立法會議員，而林之所以沒有說出筆記的話，是避免被取消資格（DQ）。萬續指戴耀廷於6月9日記者會稱參選人毋須簽協議，因不會愚蠢到製造藉口讓當權者DQ，惟當「墨落無悔」出現、抗爭派望將協議公開，民主黨便被「逼埋牆」，因此當黃碧雲在論壇被問及對「攬炒」的立場時須作出發言，胡志偉亦同樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬又指，民主黨沒公開表示否決預算案，不代表他們沒有同意；又指該黨立場原與激進抗爭派有別，但若他們不改變立場與其他參選人站在同一線，便要付出代價，即無法獲接納參與初選、並會如2019年區選般被邊緣化，直言民主黨於2020年的舉動「是他們可以生存下去的唯一方法（only way they can survive）」。萬續指，戴耀廷在辦初選之初已提及他的目標和計劃，包括「大殺傷力憲制武器」，認為被告參選必然知道背後的目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指無證據吳政亨有無差別否決共同目的-官質疑明知目的仍協助教唆&quot;&gt;辯方指無證據吳政亨有無差別否決「共同目的」 官質疑明知目的仍協助教唆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於吳政亨，代表吳的大律師梁麗幗強調無證據顯示他與其他被告有無差別否決預算案的共同目的。李運騰總結控方指吳雖沒參與初選，但他與戴耀廷達成協議並作出支持「35+計劃」的行為，包括提倡勝出初選者才能參與正式選舉，及會動員選民不投票予落選仍繼續參選的人。陳仲衡指吳的角色有如「訓導主任」，陳慶偉亦指於2020年7月1日《國安法》生效前，吳一直「協助和教唆（aiding and abetting）」該串謀計劃，而7月1日後吳於《蘋果日報》刊登「三投三不投」頭版廣告，仍繼續「協助和教唆」，並成為本案「共謀者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，吳政亨於2020年4月曾發文「【初選聯署】攬炒豈憑匹夫勇 有謀方為藝術家」，提及「大家要記著，要議會攬炒，首要條件是人數過半，35+」，指吳表明「議會攬炒」；並指吳政亨的宣傳或對計劃起影響，因原本不傾向辦初選的九龍東，於4月提及有人建議辦初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁麗幗續提出比喻，指現時情況有如戴耀廷和吳政亨正討論研發一架可載35人或以上的車輛，但在吳缺席下，戴與其他人就使用車輛的特定目的討論並達成協議，而證據僅能支持吳和戴有就研發車輛、而非使用車輛的目的討論。惟陳慶偉指，問題是吳政亨曾表明他知道戴的目的，但沒有表明反對，並繼續支持戴耀廷；李運騰亦指，戴耀廷曾應吳政亨要求向參與者轉發有關約束參選人的新聞稿，「你會說表面上沒有達成協議嗎？」梁續表示完成陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方無證據何桂藍意圖顛覆政府-指否決財案致特首下台過程為基本法所載&quot;&gt;辯方：無證據何桂藍意圖顛覆政府 指否決財案致特首下台過程為《基本法》所載&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何桂藍，Beel 指無證據顯示她有意顛覆國家政權，指兩次否決預算案引致特首解散立法會和下台的過程均是《基本法》所列明，並不構成顛覆。惟李運騰回應，「《基本法》賦予了頗多權力，但那權力有否被濫用就是另一個問題。」Beel 指那是另一議題，又稱沒證據證明被告顛覆國家政權。李指那問題就是被告是否同意濫權以嚴重影響政府運作、導致政府倒台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 回應，特首只是政府的首長，即使下台也不會影響政府運作，陳慶偉問即政府能自行運作？Beel 說政府足以自行運作（strong enough to run by itself），陳慶偉笑說「那我們完全不需從政者了」，Beel 笑說「有些人會說這樣世界會變得更好」，黃碧雲和林卓廷發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指何桂藍不曾提倡否決預算案墨落無悔非倡無差別否決&quot;&gt;辯方指何桂藍不曾提倡否決預算案、「墨落無悔」非倡無差別否決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦指，控方稱何同意無差別否決預算案的唯一證據只是「墨落無悔」聲明書。李運騰問及何桂藍在選舉論壇、訪問和抗爭派記者會的發言，Beel 指她在該些場合均不曾提及否決預算案，即使為《洛杉磯時報》撰文提及當選後會有權否決，但也沒有提倡否決。Beel 並指，「墨落無悔」僅提及會否決預算案迫使政府回應五大訴求，而非「無論如何也會無差別否決預算案」，故認為相關證據不足。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;四名被告陳詞完畢，法官押後至周五（9日）裁定表證是否成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) began life in the wake of the US-led Operation Desert Storm which evicted Iraq from Kuwait in 1991. Lessons learned from the campaign by the US armed forces included the need for an all-weather precision munition. The concept would harness the US Global Positioning System (GPS) Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) satellite constellation. GPS had been a star performer in Desert Storm. Catapulted into the public consciousness, GPS systems used by the Coalition helped weapons find their targets and troops reach their objectives. Since then, GPS has become a standard feature of military and civilian life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-jdam&quot;&gt;What is JDAM?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JDAM’s name is – to an extent – a misnomer, as it is not a weapon per se. Instead, the term covers a panoply of kits outfitting an array of “dumb” bombs. These kits equip the mid- and tail-section of an unguided bomb and contain the GPS and an Inertial Guidance System (INS). The INS, which does not depend on GPS PNT signals, also helps the weapon’s precision. Today, 15 different JDAM kits are in service, equipping a range of bombs weighing from 500 lb (225 kg) to 2,000 lb (900 kg).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic concept of operations for JDAM is for the guidance kit to be loaded with the target’s coordinates, most probably latitude and longitude. These coordinates are either transferred from the aircraft or loaded before the sortie. Target coordinates can also be updated during the mission. The weapon is released, and the tail unit continually receives signals from the GPS constellation on the bomb’s position relative to the target. The bomb’s trajectory is continually adjusted by the fins on the tail unit as it heads towards the target, based on the PNT information it is receiving and the data provided by its INS. Publicly available figures indicate that JDAM guidance kits can hit within 5 m (16 ft) of a target or less. Should the GPS signal be unavailable, the INS can steer the bomb to within 30 m (98 ft) of the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;into-ukraine&quot;&gt;Into Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JDAM deliveries commenced in 1997, with the weapon making its combat debut two years later during NATO’s Operation Allied Force in 1999. NATO’s air campaign was directed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to end the suppression of Kosovar ethnic Albanians. Since then, JDAM has been used in successive conflicts involving the US, with JDAM kits exported to over 30 countries, including Ukraine. The latter received the JDAM Extended Range (JDAM-ER) system, which gives a 500 lb bomb similar accuracy, but an extended range of 43 nautical miles (80 km). This helps Ukrainian Air Force (UAF) jets deploying the weapon to stay outside the engagement envelope of Russian short-range air defence systems like the Pantsir-S1 (NATO reporting name SA-22 Greyhound).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is no secret that Russian land forces have deployed scores of electronic warfare systems into the Ukrainian theatre of operations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exact information on the effectiveness of JDAM-ER in Ukrainian hands has not reached the public domain for understandable reasons. Nevertheless, in March, a UAF spokesperson praised the bombs’ accuracy and urged the US to supply more. JDAM was in the news again one month later, but this time for less auspicious reasons. A trove of classified US Department of Defense documents revealed concerns over the efficacy of Russian electronic warfare (EW) jamming of JDAM and other US-supplied weapons using GPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-counter-gps-tactics&quot;&gt;Russian Counter-GPS Tactics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documents articulated US concerns that Russian jamming was causing some JDAM-ER munitions to miss their targets. It is no secret that Russian land forces have deployed scores of EW systems into the Ukrainian theatre of operations. Some of these are specifically designed to jam GPS transmissions, the Russian Army’s R-330Zh Zhitel system deployed at the tactical level being a notable example. The R-330Zh detects and attacks radio signals across wavebands from 100 MHz to 2 GHz. Open sources say the system can transmit jamming signals with 10 kW of power. Signals from the US GPS satellites which JDAM kits use are transmitted on wavebands from 1.164GHz to 1.575GHz. These fall squarely within the R-330Zh’s catchment area. Official documents seen by the author state that the system has a jamming range of up to 30 km (18.6 miles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GPS signals are very weak by the time they have travelled the 10,900 nautical miles (20,200 km) from the satellite to Earth. Radio signal strength is typically measured in decibels-per-milliwatt (dBm). GPS signals can have a strength of circa −127 dBm by the time they reach Earth. Such weak signals can be easy to jam with comparatively little power. To put matters into perspective, a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the R-330Zh can generate a jamming signal strength of −70 dBm. Like a long-distance runner, radio signals lose strength the further they travel. Thus, the R-330Zh’s signal may reduce by between −123 dBm and −126 dBm, depending on the jamming frequency, by the time it travels its full 30 km range. Nonetheless, even at between −53 dBm and −56 dBm, it is still notably stronger than the strength of the GPS signal arriving from space. Moreover, the closer the GPS receiver is to the R-330Zh’s jamming antenna, the stronger the jamming signal becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has made strenuous efforts to mitigate the jamming risk to JDAM. In the early 2000s, the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SASSM) upgrade was rolled out across the JDAM fleet. This included the addition of guidance kits using M-Code GPS transmissions. M-Code is the encrypted military GPS signal. The JDAM’s GPS receiver will only accept signals with this encryption, excluding all others. Technically, if jamming signals are being transmitted from an R-330Zh, the JDAM munition should ignore these as they lack the appropriate encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-is-this-happening&quot;&gt;Why is This Happening?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the steps the US has taken to safeguard JDAM’s resilience to global navigation satellite system (GNSS) jamming, it may still be vulnerable. One senior EW expert told the author that, even with SASSM, the sheer brute force of a powerful jamming signal can prevent the JDAM’s GNSS receiver from obtaining the encrypted signal. Steps can be taken to try to nullify any jamming. The exact capabilities of the JDAM’s GNSS systems are understandably classified. Counter-EW provisions may include the system recognising a jamming signal and its direction. The receiver may then be able to “block out” signals coming from that direction, while continuing to receive GNSS signals from unaffected areas. A GNSS receiver will typically need to “see” – that is, have an uninterrupted Line-of-Sight (LOS) with – at least four satellites. Often, a GNSS receiver has more satellites than this within range. Thus, blocking off the direction of the jamming signals will not necessarily deprive the receiver of being able to “see” other satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Jamming is not causing JDAMs to stop working, but it is risking their accuracy – arguably a key selling point of the weapon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is possible that Russian forces may choose to protect potential JDAM targets with multiple jammers, enabling signals to hit the GNSS receiver from two or more directions. This could deprive the receiver of the LOS range to unjammed GNSS signals. Above all, the problem may well be the sheer power of the jamming signal that can be brought to bear, as shown by the R-330Zh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem for the Russians is that a powerful jamming signal may be comparatively easy for Ukrainian EW experts to detect. Once the jamming signal is detected and identified as such, the jammer’s latitude and longitude could then be determined. These coordinates could be passed to artillery and engaged with kinetic fires. This tactic may help to explain some of Russia’s EW equipment losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that transmitting a huge amount of jamming power across the frequencies used by PNT signals has the potential to jam any other radio traffic weaker than the jamming signal. This could include friendly receivers like satellite communications terminals and GNSS systems. For example, Russia’s GLONASS GNSS constellation transmits some signals which are similar to GPS. These risk being jammed by friendly signals. Evidence from Ukraine suggests that the Russian Army regularly suffers electromagnetic fratricide to this end. The force often exhibits scant concern for jamming friendly signals when attacking its enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EW expert also told the author that it is possible to spoof GNSS signals. For example, an EW system receives the incoming M-Code transmitted from space. It takes the signal and retransmits it, but with a stronger amplification. The JDAM system may recognise this signal as legitimate, but the fake signal may be subtly modified to feed false information into the GNSS system. Hypothetically, the M-Code could be modified and retransmitted in such a way as to deceive the JDAM vis-à-vis its position in time and space. This could then affect the munition’s accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-now&quot;&gt;What Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia’s GNSS jamming activities may not be cost-free from an electromagnetic fratricide and hard kill vulnerability perspective, the leaked US documents show that it is having an impact. Jamming is not causing the JDAMs to stop working, but it is risking their accuracy – arguably a key selling point of the weapon. This is a potential problem when comparatively small targets are being engaged. US GNSS engineers may have to rethink how they safeguard JDAMs for the wars of tomorrow, based on the conflicts of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Western nations and their allies across the globe impose a growing raft of sanctions on the Russian economy, evidence is emerging of adaptations in Russia’s financial and trade strategy. Examples include the switching of ownership of companies and properties to family members or affiliates, the use of trading companies to source foreign exchange to avoid the sanctions imposed on the Central Bank of Russia, and import substitution, which the country has adopted since it was first targeted by Western sanctions in 2014. Alongside these steps, Russia is now gravitating further towards other states that have faced similarly sweeping restrictive measures or that facilitate sanctions evasion, to learn best practice, secure necessary services and establish trade relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By highlighting the experience of other rogue states, this paper examines the question of how Western governments, notably in Europe, and their private sectors could strengthen their sanctions implementation and enforcement strategies in light of potential changes in Russia’s financial activity. In particular, the paper considers techniques that Russia might learn from rogue states to create a similar – or interconnected – parallel financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, Iran represents a notable case study. The country has faced financial sanctions from the international community for years, seeks to fund its economy through the export of hydrocarbons, and has most recently had to adapt to the reimposition of sanctions by the US, following former US president Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), under which Iran originally received certain UN, unilateral and national sanctions reliefs related to its nuclear programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran also demonstrates the kinds of symbiotic relationships (or mutually beneficial commercial partnerships) between rogue states and non-state actors (including designated terrorist groups) that can benefit from the move to clandestine finance systems. For example, Iran’s funding and resourcing of Hizbullah is reciprocated in numerous ways, including through support for the state’s intermediary oil trading schemes. Such joint ventures or marriages of convenience between rogue states and their proxies may possibly be mirrored in the ways in which private military companies patronised by Russia advance Russian interests (and enable the circumvention of sanctions) globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To facilitate its trade and finance ambitions, Iran also co-opts service providing states, such as financial centres, where supervision and enforcement of financial crime regulations is weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While evidence has yet to emerge of the complete adaptation of the financial systems needed by Russia to run its economy in defiance of allied sanctions, given the likely prolonged isolation of Russia from the international financial system, similar to Iran, it can be expected that it will seek to establish parallel financial relations that seek to evade the sanctions set against it by Ukraine’s allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying logic of the use of sanctions measures is coercion through economic restriction. If a state cannot sell goods and services to generate hard international currencies or cannot use such currencies to buy the items it needs to sustain its activities or support its regime, then eventually – the theory goes – that state will need to reconsider its course of action. To beat sanctions, therefore, targeted states need to find ways to sustain domestic economic activity and trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has been subject to some form of economic sanction since 1979. The country has had decades in which to develop finance and trade networks that facilitate the evasion of Western sanctions, from those banning Iranian imports to the US following the 1979 hostage crisis through the US designation of Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984 and a range of nuclear-related UN Security Council sanctions resolutions in the early 2000s to the more recent reimposition and ramping up of sanctions under former president Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign following the US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in May 2018. Other countries have likewise developed mechanisms for evading Western sanctions. North Korea has established networks and structures for continuing to source the materials and funding it needs to pursue its ambition to develop its nuclear programme; Venezuela has similarly facilitated the export of oil in contravention of US sanctions; and countries as diverse as Sudan, Yemen and Zimbabwe have similarly grappled with evading the sanctions net imposed by the US, the EU or their allies that dominate the global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, with an economy estimated to be worth US$90 billion, and a need to export its oil and import the goods required to support its domestic and military economies, it is Iran that has developed the most sophisticated and wide-reaching mechanisms. Such mechanisms seek to allow it to operate beyond the reach of Western economic sanctions and the financial systems controlled by the US, the UK and the EU. This is particularly so since the collapse – in essence – of the JCPOA. This deal, struck in 2015, provided certain nuclear-related sanctions reliefs to Iran which, when Trump removed his support for the deal in 2018, saw sanctions on Iran “snap back”. Although the remaining signatories to the deal sought to sustain it via negotiation and financial engineering, the latter an attempt to facilitate continued trade with Iran in the face of US sanctions, the dominance of the US and the US dollar in global trade and finance has neutered these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this background, since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Western officials have expressed concerns over Russia’s growing proximity to Iran and other rogue states, and the impact of these relationships on the future of the international order. One anticipated development is that these states – all subject to sanctions regimes – will share lessons on how to avoid restrictive measures and abuse the international financial system for their own malign purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until February 2022, for most parts of the global financial and economic system, Russia represented a business and profit-making opportunity. Since the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, this position has, of course, rapidly reversed as wide-ranging sanctions have been imposed on the Russian economy and financial system. This reversal of integration has presented challenges that will require Western allies to pay detailed attention to any ongoing economic connection with Russia, while at the same time, the Kremlin will face the challenge of maintaining both its civilian and military supply chains in the face of the rupturing of previously reliable funding and resourcing connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper seeks to answer the question: how should Western governments, notably those in Europe, and their private sectors strengthen their sanctions implementation and enforcement to counter changes in Russia’s financial activity that have been borrowed from rogue states?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has four chapters. Chapter I reviews the key measures taken by the international community to restrict the financial activity of rogue states and assess the various means by which these states have sought to blunt these efforts. To illustrate these concepts in more detail, the case of Iran is used in Chapter II to detail particular activities that may be relevant to the newest member of the rogue state club, Russia. Chapter III focuses on Russia and why and how these tools may be relevant as Western sanctions in response to Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine tighten and isolate the country from its traditional markets. Chapter IV considers the current weaknesses in the financial system that are exploited by rogue states. The paper concludes with recommendations for Western policymakers and those supervising and operating in the international financial system to refocus their efforts to ensure that they are equipped with the understanding and tools to blunt the effort of rogue states to finance their malign activities via alternative financial and economic systems, described by some – and in this paper – as “clandestine finance systems” (CFSs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What emerges is a picture of varyingly complex CFSs with shared family characteristics, which use, among other techniques, overseas front companies and ledger systems to mask the financing and transacting of trade. Of particular concern, beyond the need to ensure that financial and economic restrictions placed on a country’s activities to support international security objectives are implemented, is that this activity can also be used by rogue states to transfer funds to their proxies. As the example of Iran shows, the development of a CFS can provide new avenues for state-sponsored terrorist financing, and indeed can make a virtue of a necessity by actively involving the designated terrorist group in the management of a CFS. An analysis of the activities of Russia’s private military company the Wagner Group suggests that such activity is clearly a very real possibility as Russia adapts to the pressure of international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is informed by a review of English-language open source literature on the evasion techniques used by countries currently under stringent sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council (UNSC) and/or coalitions of Western states. Specifically, this review was undertaken in the first quarter of 2023 and draws on material from official documents produced by international organisations such as the UN and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global anti-money-laundering and counterterrorist-financing standard setter, and national governments’ institutions and agencies, such as the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the US’s main sanctions administrator. It considers academic and policy research from online searches via Google and dedicated research databases such as EBSCO and JSTOR, and, in addition, reputable and corroborated media reporting. The research draws on credible leak databases, notably Wiki Iran, and sources relied on by professionals in governments and the private sector to support their identification of sanctions evasion activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research faced a number of constraints as there is limited open source information on the mechanics of CFSs. The operational effectiveness of CFSs requires those controlling them to protect “tradecraft” secrets, and those agencies dedicated to interdicting them will be wary of sharing this knowledge publicly, if known, for fear of prompting a change in the target’s behaviour. This means that much of what is known relies heavily on the public statements of government agencies taking enforcement action (most commonly OFAC) or when an international organisation is mandated to provide a review of sanctions evasion activities (such as through one of the Panel of Experts (PoEs) tasked with reviewing the implementation of UNSC resolutions). Bearing in mind the clandestine nature of this activity, interviews were only used to validate the credibility of certain sources, in particular Wiki Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;definitions-and-terminology&quot;&gt;Definitions and Terminology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper uses a number of terms which vary in use and novelty. “Rogue states” was a phrase first used in 1994 by then US National Security Adviser Anthony Lake to describe countries which consistently flouted international standards and took an adversarial position towards the US and its allies. This definition is used in this paper and applied to those states that are also subject to severe UNSC and/or Western bi- or multilateral sanctions as a result of their behaviour: Belarus, Iran, Myanmar, Nicaragua, North Korea, Russia, Syria, and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “clandestine finance system” is new, and – notwithstanding its use in a 2022 Wall Street Journal article on Iran – does not have wide currency in academic or policy debate. In this paper, it refers to a method, or set of methods, used by a government, government agency or a non-state actor to undertake illicit economic and/or financial activities without detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a third key term, “terrorist financing”, the paper draws on the work of contemporary researchers such as Jessica Davis, who define it as a set of financial activities – raising, using, storing, moving, managing and obscuring funds – undertaken to fulfil terrorist purposes, whether those purposes are operational, such as mounting attacks, or organisational, such as providing ongoing day-to-day support for the group or network. In terms of terrorist financing, the paper focuses mainly on the raising and moving of funds from states to their terrorist dependents, while also discussing active and intentional state support for terrorist groups, rather than passive state support or negligence, which might allow terrorists or their supporters to conduct financing activities unimpeded. Although some researchers treat passive support as a form of “state sponsorship of terrorism”, if included here it would potentially bring in several states for consideration not widely recognised as rogue states. A noted recent example would be Qatar, which was sanctioned by several of its regional neighbours from June 2017 to January 2021 for allegedly supporting terrorism and criticised – but not sanctioned – by the US for its failure to do enough to tackle terrorist fundraising more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-targeting-rogue-states&quot;&gt;I. Targeting Rogue States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;his chapter reviews the methods by which the international community has targeted the financial and economic activities of rogue states and how these states have responded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a wide range of literature reviewing the use of sanctions, both in a historical context and considering more contemporary use from a policymaker perspective. The private sector also produces extensive research on the topic in support of banks and other regulated sectors that are required to implement asset freezes under sanctions designations. This chapter does not intend to revisit in detail this literature, but highlights why it is that rogue state CFSs have developed as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions are most commonly deployed by states or groups of states facing national security challenges to coerce a state back to acceptable behaviour, or at the very least punish the regime of that state. For example, the 2021 US Treasury Sanctions Review argues that the use of sanctions against Iran to prevent it from&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;using the international financial system and commercial markets to generate revenue through oil sales and other activities that support its nuclear and ballistic missile proliferation and support for terrorist activities … pushed Iran to the negotiating table on its nuclear program in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Iran, the review also claims that US sanctions “so significantly impaired Hizballah funding streams that in 2019 the organization had to reduce salaries for its military arm and media efforts and publicly solicit donations”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most widely recognised sanctions are those issued by the UNSC, to which all 193 UN member states are required to adhere. Outside the UN, there are also a growing number of autonomous sanctions regimes, including those of the US, the EU, Canada, the UK and Australia. Of these, the most potent is that of the US, which uses the power and ubiquity of the US dollar in international trade not only to prevent its own nationals and businesses from engaging with designated targets (primary sanctions), but also on occasion those of other nations (secondary sanctions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elements of these autonomous national regimes vary. Depending on the targeted country and the issuing authority, some of the most common areas of designation include: embargos on arms; military materiel and technology; trade and investment bans on key export/import sectors; and asset freezes and travel bans on individuals and entities linked to the regime or malign activities. The Western allies’ latest sanctions on Russia have gone further to also include prohibiting the use of airspace, roads and ports, and a ban on certain media outlets. There can also be asset freezes and bans on transactions for designated financial institutions, as well as restrictions on access to the infrastructure of international finance such as the SWIFT messaging system, currently affecting financial institutions in Iran (extensively) and Russia (partially).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, for states whose economies rely on access to international markets for trade (such as the sale and purchase of oil and other hydrocarbons) and finance, sanctions should pose a material restriction. Yet rogue states have agency, and the next section considers how these states might choose to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rogue-state-responses&quot;&gt;Rogue State Responses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, the underlying logic of these sanctions measures is coercion through economic restriction. If a country cannot sell goods and services to generate hard international currencies or cannot use such currencies to buy the items the state needs to sustain its activities or support its regime, then eventually – the theory goes – that state will need to reconsider its course of action. To beat sanctions, therefore, targeted states need to find ways to sustain domestic economic activity and trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The responses of rogue states to this predicament have been varied, although there has been a familiar rhetorical commitment to self-sufficiency from states such as South Africa during the apartheid era and Iraq after the first Gulf War in 1991. In 2007, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei coined the term “resistance economy”, a concept which has developed since into a programme of initiatives which include reduced consumption and waste and more efficient use of domestic economic resources. Rogue states have also sought to continue economic interactions in commercial sectors where sanctions are more ambiguous. For many years, North Korea has sought to continue working between the cracks of UN sanctions, providing construction workers, medical services and other forms of cheap labour to sympathetic states, for example in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the UNSC required UN members to repatriate all North Korean workers by 22 December 2019, UN PoE reports continue to suggest their presence overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others have continued to trade openly in commodities that are subject to unilateral sanctions (for example, sanctions from the US or the EU), but not UN-backed sanctions. Russia has sought to work around the Western designations of its oil sales by finding new buyers among “neutral” states such as China and India, who have not applied sanctions to Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A further area of open activity has been the negotiation of barter deals, which, by relying on the physical exchange of equally valued goods, potentially avoids points of contact with the US dollar or other international currencies where activity should be identified and blocked by the banking system. Such deals are being attempted between sanctioned states, such as Iran and Venezuela, but also between sanctioned and neutral partners, such as Iran and Pakistan, since December 2021. Heavily sanctioned states – Russia and Iran, for example – have also started denominating bilateral trade in their local currencies, as well as looking to trade in non-Western currencies, such as the Chinese renminbi and UAE dirhams, as a form of alternative international settlement currency to the US dollar. Last, to support the development on non-G7 currency trade, countries are establishing connected domestic currency settlement systems. For example, Russia and Iran are reportedly integrating both their national financial messaging systems and their individual bank card networks (respectively called Mir and Shetab), which is expected to facilitate the de-dollarisation of financial transactions related to bilateral trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-the-asian-clearing-union-acu&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study: The Asian Clearing Union (ACU)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As global trade becomes more fragmented under the pressure of sanctions and efforts by those subject to sanctions to circumvent the reach of the US dollar and other G7 currencies, as indicated earlier, advance barter trade is becoming more prominent. Barter trade is a form of exchange that has existed for millennia, but in the modern era its relevance has resurged in the face of national capital controls that restrict cross-border payments, and liquidity shortages created by bilateral payment clearing between nations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a result of these restrictions, various settlement systems have been developed that allow for payments to be “netted”, which means that where groups of countries trade with each other, only balancing payments – rather than gross payments – need to be made between central banks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One such settlement forum is the ACU. Formed in 1974 at the initiative of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the ACU now comprises nine members, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In essence, the ACU facilitates trade between the member nations without the need for payment beyond a final settlement payment. Such a structure is tailor-made to support sanctions evasion as it allows countries to trade without an accompanying financial transaction. While the ACU has accounts with the formal financial system to facilitate the netting of these “IOUs” between countries, where a final balancing payment is needed, this payment can also be made in a local currency, avoiding the need to use the Western banking system. With the advent of central bank digital currencies, such balancing payments, made beyond the reach of Western authorities, are likely to become even easier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Such settlement platforms, originally established to enhance regional trade, are likely to face a renaissance as countries face new financial system restrictions, this time caused by sanctions rather than liquidity or capital controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-irans-journey-of-financial-system-innovation&quot;&gt;II. Iran’s Journey of Financial System Innovation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this outline of the different ways in which rogue states and those that facilitate their activity operate, this chapter considers the specific case of Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overt trade efforts with friends and neutrals are only one aspect of how sanctioned states continue to survive. Clandestine activities are also key. Facing the dominance of US dollar pricing in international trade, rogue states need to find ways to generate dollars they do not currently have, and ways to spend them. In the first half of the requirement – making money – two methods commonly appear: secretly converting domestic currency and assets; and generating funds through committing illicit acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has a long history of seeking to respond to sanctions. It is beyond the scope of this paper to review this history, which has been addressed in detail by others. This paper therefore considers contemporary examples, taken primarily from sanctions designations made by OFAC, to demonstrate the way in which Iran has used CFSs to operate its economy while under sanctions, specifically considering currency conversion and intermediary trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;currency-conversion&quot;&gt;Currency Conversion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currency conversion requires the physical transfer of domestic currency out of the rogue state, its conversion into physical US dollars, and its successful return. In recent years, the US has outlined publicly two such cases of currency conversion linked to Iran. In May 2018, OFAC revealed a scheme where the regime’s elite military unit, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), transferred Iran’s domestic currency, the rial, in bulk to the UAE, where it was then converted into US dollars by complicit money exchange houses, an activity that was hidden from authorities through the creation of forged documentation. In a further designation in September 2021, OFAC identified another scheme involving the IRGC, where currency and gold were smuggled on commercial flights to Turkey operated by the Iranian airline Mahan Air, itself a US-designated carrier. Once the trade was completed, the currency and gold were sold via a complicit intermediary, and the proceeds were transferred by commercial flight back to Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intermediary-trading&quot;&gt;Intermediary Trading&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, however, unrealistic to expect bulk conversion of domestic currencies – or the increasingly reported use of cryptocurrencies – to be feasible on the kind of scale necessary to support even a mid-sized economy such as Iran’s, where imports and exports are valued in the tens of billions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some rogue states, such as North Korea, supplement this approach by conducting illicit activities. Since the 1970s, North Korea has built up an extensive charge sheet, including the production and trafficking of illegal narcotics; the counterfeiting and trafficking of pharmaceuticals, cigarettes and US currency; and the smuggling and sale of high-value items, including precious metals, stones and illegal wildlife. More recently, however, the North Korean state’s direct involvement in some of these schemes has waned, most notably narcotics trafficking, superseded by a focus on cybercrime, and in particular the theft of cryptocurrency. According to research by Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm, North Korean hackers stole the equivalent of US$400 million in cryptocurrencies in 2021, a figure that will be far surpassed in 2022, following hacks that have included the theft in March of US$600-million worth of cryptocurrencies from online game platform Ronin Network’s Axie Infinity game. A high proportion of these funds are reportedly cashed out over time into renminbi through offshore cryptocurrency exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While converting domestic cash and generating illicit funds can make hard currency, neither provides an immediate way to use those funds to buy goods on the open market. A more sophisticated and dual-sided mechanism, allowing both the generation of funds and the means to spend them, is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution that Iran has developed is to continue trading by hiding its activities behind intermediaries, or “hidden subsidiaries”, as senior Iranian official Gholamreza Mesbahi-Moghaddam described them in a live debate in January 2021. These schemes are not identical, but they rest on similar structures and patterns, described below in a simplified composite form, drawn from explanations in several sources and illustrated in more detail with case studies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entities within the rogue state, for example, Iranian banks, rahbar (“pioneer”) companies and exchange houses in Iran, are tasked with facilitating sanctioned international trade – whether exports or imports – for designated domestic sectors or businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this, they rely on existing networks of businesses and agents based overseas who are tasked with setting up front companies and accompanying bank accounts through which to accomplish trade. These overseas networks might be managed by rogue state nationals, others posing as third country nationals, or by actual trusted third country nationals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the sanctioned state needs to export goods, the front company will sell the designated product or commodity to a buyer, knowingly or otherwise, using falsified documentation. The front company will also engage complicit logistics firms to transport the goods, often using well-known techniques to hide the origin of goods, including changing ship names at sea, transferring goods ship-to-ship with electronic tracking turned off, camouflaging goods with non-designated items, or blending and relabelling commodities such as oil at major transhipment hubs. The funds for the sale will be paid into the front company’s bank account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although some funds might be withdrawn and couriered back to the rogue state, most will be used instead to support import activity. Requests for imports from other designated firms or institutions will be issued to the front company, which will then apply similar techniques to buy and transport goods without revealing their destination, paying for the goods with the funds previously received into its account in receipt of exported items. To ensure that this trade balances, centralised institutions such as the Central Bank of Iran monitor this activity and run ledgers which ensure that countervailing transactions are made domestically to ensure exporters receive compensation for the original sale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These schemes can vary enormously in their complexity. For states under more limited designation, they can be relatively basic and only used to provide a cut-out for exports; for example, according to 2021 research by civil society group Justice for Myanmar, the US-designated Myanmar Timber Enterprise, the main state-owned exporter of timber in Myanmar, uses a single layer of private and undesignated Myanmar-based companies to sell its goods on to US importers. By comparison, and explored further below, the matrix of companies now being used by Iran to sell oil and related goods to customers in South, Southeast and East Asia is multilayered, with various front companies based in locations such as Turkey, the UAE and Hong Kong being used to hide the connection to Iran, sometimes “trading” the commodities with each other before dealing with the end customer in South, Southeast or East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following three case studies illustrate these forms of clandestine finance activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-1-iranian-petrochemical-sales&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 1: Iranian Petrochemical Sales&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following the US withdrawal from the JCPOA under the Trump presidency, Iran’s intermediary trading networks were revived in response to the reimposition of sanctions by the US. Starting in 2019, OFAC designations on various components of Iran’s vast intermediary trading network aimed to forestall the country’s efforts to sell its petrochemical products in contravention of US sanctions, mostly to markets in East and South Asia. These OFAC designations are focused on interdicting the networks around two crucial brokerage nodes, Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company (PGPIC) and Triliance Petrochemical Co. Ltd. Once designated, all property and interests in property of these entities subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them. Importantly, furthermore, foreign financial institutions that knowingly facilitate significant transactions for, or persons that provide material or certain other support to, the subjects of these designations risk exposure to sanctions that could sever their own access to the US financial system or block their property and interests in property under US jurisdiction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In June 2019, OFAC sanctioned Iran’s largest and most profitable petrochemical holding company, PGPIC, and 39 of its subsidiaries and foreign-based sales agents, at the time accounting for 40% of Iran’s total petrochemical production capacity and 50% of its petrochemical exports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In January 2020, OFAC took action against Triliance Petrochemical Co. Ltd, a broker based in Hong Kong which ordered the transfer of the equivalent of millions of dollars to the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) as payment for petroleum products (PPs) delivered to the UAE and China, concealing their Iranian origin. Other companies based in Hong Kong (Sage Energy HK Limited), China (Peakview Industries Co. Limited) and the UAE (Beneathco DMCC) were sanctioned by OFAC for the same reason.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In September 2020, six entities based in the UAE and Hong Kong were designated for supporting Triliance’s sanctions evasion efforts by, among other things, acting as the purchaser on behalf of Triliance for hundreds of thousands of metric tonnes of Iranian PPs for onward sale. Other companies were used to settle fees owed by Triliance and to facilitate the shipment and resale of PPs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Further Iranian, Chinese and Singaporean companies were sanctioned in October 2020 for similarly supporting Triliance’s sanctions evasion by settling, processing and transferring the proceeds of PP sales it had brokered for Iranian producers. Chinese and Emirati companies providing shipping services and conducting financial transactions for Triliance as front companies were sanctioned in December 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More front companies for Triliance and PGPIC and enabling entities were designated by OFAC in June 2022 (including an Indian national, Mohammad Shaheed Ruknooddin Bhore, who managed multiple Triliance front companies), July, August, September and November 2022, and February and March 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The latest of these designations, in March 2023, is of particular note. As described by OFAC, 39 entities, “constituting a significant ‘shadow banking’ network”, were sanctioned, representing “one of several multi-jurisdictional illicit finance systems which grant sanctioned Iranian entities … access to the international financial system and obfuscate their trade with foreign customers”. This and similar networks involving front companies in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, Singapore and the UAE operate precisely the ledger systems referred to in this paper as CFSs that allow Iran to generate “the equivalent of tens of billions of dollars annually for the Iranian regime”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As illustrated in this most recent designation by OFAC, front companies and enabling entities are almost always based in Iran, China, Hong Kong or the UAE, with some further entities based in Singapore, Malaysia and India. Resembling a game of “whack-a-mole”, it would appear that US designations and sanctions action serve to expose small portions of a vast network momentarily, only for the network to adapt and compensate with the formation and use of new companies. That sanctioned entities are all based in just a few countries speaks to the lacklustre approach – and thus high-risk nature – of these countries to taking prudent action against Iran’s intermediary trading scheme, even after multiple rounds of OFAC actions targeting companies based in their jurisdictions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A further example of how front companies in permissive jurisdictions can facilitate sanctions evasion is provided by the case of Sitki Ayan and ASB Group.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A dossier of business contracts and bank documents leaked in late 2022 detail the years-long involvement of a Turkish businessman (and close contact of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan) and his network of companies in facilitating Iran’s sanctioned oil trade and clandestine finance schemes. Accusations made against Sitki Ayan and his Gibraltar-registered holding company ASB Group of Companies were substantiated with an extensive designation from OFAC made hours after the leak, which outlines how Ayan and his business network facilitated and concealed the sale and shipment of oil from NIOC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following the reimposition of US sanctions on Iran following Trump’s withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018, ASB found a niche in supporting Iran’s re-energised illicit oil enterprise by leasing shipping tankers through its subsidiaries to transport oil from Iran to China. ASB also routed payments through an elaborate network of shell companies and banks in India, Russia and the UAE, which, as payments were denominated in foreign currency (most commonly US dollars), were inevitably settled by international banks such as Commerzbank and J P Morgan, which failed to identify their connection with Iran. Oil shipments to Russia also relied on barter for payment, with sanctions-exempt foodstuffs including wheat and sunflower oil offering camouflage for petroleum product purchases, and leaving Iran with both valuable foreign currency and other scarce consumer goods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alongside the widespread use of front companies in countries offering opaque corporate structures and/or with weak supervisory regimes, the Iranian state also mobilises proxies to facilitate its financial activity, notably the IRGC and its Quds Force. As a parallel security structure to Iran’s armed forces, these offer Iran a useful functionality for operating its sanctions evasion regime, particularly where operatives are based outside the country.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In March 2020, OFAC designated several IRGC-controlled front organisations used to hide its money-laundering and illicit revenue-generation activities, including a scheme involving a charitable organisation supposedly dedicated to maintaining Shiite shrines in Iraq, donations to which were redirected to supplement the IRGC’s own budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the same way, and emulating a strategy employed by North Korea, Iran’s foreign embassies offer useful cover for the illicit movement of funds. Iran International reported in January 2023 that the country’s embassy in Iraq had been the site of an IRGC-maintained money-laundering operation aiding the repatriation of revenues from Iran’s illicit petrochemical product sales. Here, embassy staff receive export revenue in cash from Iraqi currency exchanges and then deposit it into the embassy’s accounts, supposedly to fund legitimate embassy operations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last, Lebanese Hizbullah, often assumed to be a mere recipient of funds from Iran and an ideologically aligned group, also plays a part in facilitating the CFSs of its host and benefactor. For example, to pay for its imports of Iranian oil, in 2022 Venezuela reportedly shipped gold from Caracas to Tehran using Iran-controlled Mahan Air, with senior Hizbullah officials identified as being involved in easing these shipments, later liquidated in Turkey and other nearby countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these case studies demonstrate, complex corporate structures and financial engineering have allowed Iran to continue to operate its economy – at times by exploiting large international banks – by developing CFSs that benefit both its economy and proxies operating internationally on behalf of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-russian-response&quot;&gt;III. The Russian Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter considers the Russian context, as the Kremlin seeks ways to evade the tightening Western sanctions imposed in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Western allies have placed a wide range of economic and trade sanctions on Russia to reduce its ability to fund and resource its military machine. These sanctions have targeted financial flows by reducing the Kremlin’s access not only to the international financial system but also to sales of goods – such as high-tech chips – needed to restock Russian military supplies. They are also being felt in the ability of Russia to export its oil and other hydrocarbon products, as well as to source Western expertise, such as servicing for its Airbus and Boeing civil airliners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these restrictions – and with no sign that President Vladimir Putin intends to reverse his course in Ukraine – Russia is increasingly needing to find new sources to fund its military materiel and resourcing requirements, which is encouraging the Kremlin to gravitate towards those other jurisdictions – notably Iran – that have developed their own responses to Western trade and financial sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among these responses, discussions of their experience of de-dollarisation took place during Putin’s meeting with Khamenei during the summit between Russia, Iran and Turkey in Tehran on 19 July 2022. A reported statement from the Iranian Supreme Leader emphasised “long-term cooperation between Iran and Russia as being greatly, deeply beneficial to both countries”, marking a clear rapprochement between the countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2022, Russian and Iranian leaders met again in Tehran, with a visit from Russian Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev, a leading ally of Putin, to Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi to deepen trade and security cooperation. The increasingly closer connections materialised in January 2023 with the reporting of the decision of Iran and Russia to connect their interbank communication and transfer systems to help boost trade and financial transactions, overcoming their ban from SWIFT, a model that Russia could look to replicate with other key trading partners to mitigate the SWIFT messaging system restrictions more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the latest political move, the deputy foreign ministers of Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iran were scheduled to meet again in Moscow in March 2023, but the meeting will now be held at a later undisclosed date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with these growing political ties, Russia is widely reported to have been sourcing military equipment – notably drones – from Iran as it seeks to overcome the resupply challenges posed by Western sanctions. In response – and demonstrating the seriousness with which Ukraine’s allies are treating this growing relationship – Western allies are increasingly targeting Iranian entities with sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On 8 September 2022, OFAC designated Safiran Airport Services, an air transportation service provider, for its involvement in the shipment of Iranian UAVs to Russia for its war against Ukraine. Additionally, OFAC designated Paravar Pars Company, Design and Manufacturing of Aircraft Engines, and Baharestan Kish Company and its managing director, Rehmatollah Heidari, for their involvement in the research, development, production and procurement of Iranian UAVs and UAV components, including the Shahed series of drones, for Iran’s IRGC and its Aerospace Force and Navy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On 15 November 2022, OFAC designated Shahed Aviation Industries Research Center, the firm responsible for the design and production of Shahed-series UAVs used by Russian forces in Ukraine. OFAC also designated Success Aviation Services FZC and i Jet Global DMCC for facilitating the transfer of Iranian UAVs to Russia. To complement the US State Department’s designation of the Wagner Group, OFAC also targeted two individuals for facilitating Wagner’s acquisition of UAVs from Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On 6 January 2023, OFAC designated six executives and board members of US-designated Qods Aviation Industry Company, a key Iranian defence manufacturer responsible for the design and production of UAVs transferred for use in Ukraine, now updated on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, to include its new alias, Light Airplanes Design and Manufacturing Industries. OFAC also designated the director of Iran’s Aerospace Industries Organization, the key organisation responsible for overseeing Iran’s ballistic missile programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On 9 March 2023, OFAC designated a China-based network of five companies and one individual for supporting Iran’s UAV procurement efforts to the Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company (HESA). HESA has been involved in the production of the Shahed-136 UAV model that Iran has used to attack oil tankers and has also exported to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the advancement of financial ties and the sourcing of drones are the most high-profile examples, other connections are also important and growing. For example, unable to have its aircraft serviced in the West, Aeroflot has reported that it is starting to send planes to Iran for servicing; Russia has also been learning lessons from Iran on how to develop a shadow fleet of tankers for transporting oil in circumvention of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of these clear links between Russia and the provision of Iranian drones, the US Departments of Commerce, Treasury and Justice have also recently provided warning of the methods being adopted by Russia to evade sanctions. This Russian activity reflects the Iranian playbook, with the Tri-Seal Compliance Note observing Russia’s “use of third-party intermediaries or transshipment points to circumvent restrictions, disguise the involvement of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDNs) or parties on the Entity List in transactions, and obscure the true identities of Russian end users” and providing a range of red flags that can be indicative of such activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the sanctions placed on Russia by allied nations are comprehensive, Russia has agency, and it is already developing measures to circumvent these restrictions to continue to fund and resource its military. Indeed, in the March 2023 Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation, the Kremlin makes no secret of its interest in supporting the development of circumvention measures, asserting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The abuse by certain states of their dominant position in some spheres intensifies the processes of fragmentation of the global economy and increases disparity in the development of states. New national and trans-border payment systems are becoming widespread, there is a growing interest in new international reserve currencies, and prerequisites for diversifying international economic cooperation mechanisms are being created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this paper has reviewed, many of the challenges that sanctions are placing on Russia have been faced previously by other rogue states – notably Iran – that have themselves developed means by which to limit the impact of these restrictions. This experience is inevitably instructive for Russia. Evidence is already emerging of Russia taking lessons from Iran’s playbook (for example, its development of a shadow oil tanker fleet); partnering with Iran in financial services and technical expertise that it can no longer source from Western nations; and developing financial and trade structures that obfuscate beneficiaries. If allied nations are to create the impact they wish with their restrictive measures, they will need to study the lessons Russia is likely to draw and ensure they anticipate and restrict the attempted adaptations that follow as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-weaknesses-in-the-financial-system-response&quot;&gt;IV. Weaknesses in the Financial System Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As emerges from the previous chapters, the evasion techniques employed by Iran often rely on the use of the formal financial system, which has for decades been required to closely monitor the transactions it facilitates for abuse – including sanctions evasion activity. Yet the formal financial system continues to be associated with sanctions evasion, suggesting that the system and those that supervise it need to consider how they should adapt and work harder and smarter to minimise opportunities for abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integrity of the global financial system is monitored via the implementation of the standards of the FATF. As a result, in the face of rogue state subterfuge, countries that follow the FATF standards and those that have developed their own unilateral sanctions regimes should have measures in place to detect and prevent sanctions evasion, many of which rely on and are implemented by the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the gatekeepers of the financial system under the FATF standards, financial institutions and other obliged entities are required to undertake client due diligence (CDD) when they “onboard” a client, and periodically thereafter; and to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activity to the authorities. Under national laws, they are also required to ensure that sanctions are not breached, which most businesses do by screening customer names and transactions for the presence of, or connection with, designated entities and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the theory, but these requirements are well known to rogue states and their supporting networks, and thus for many of the techniques discussed in this paper, anti-financial crime and sanctions measures are likely to be irrelevant. The funds being transferred to support a rogue state and its proxies will not enter the financial system (for example, because bulk cash is being used) or, if they do enter it, they will either not be moved through the wider international financial system but be channelled through an institution where measures have already been subverted, in a jurisdiction potentially subject to malign outside influences (such as that of Iran over parts of the Iraqi banking system), or else they will be sufficiently disguised such that banks are unable to easily detect the malign connection of the transactions they are processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While circumvention opportunities will always exist, and the formal financial sector is not always involved in these schemes, there is certainly room for financial crime and sanctions detection measures to provide more effective barriers with regard to the sorts of intermediary trading schemes detailed in this paper that rogue states are using to avoid sanctions. In the case of Iran, documents provided by sources such as Wiki Iran clearly indicate that funds appear to be moving unchallenged through the international financial system, and through accounts set up and/or held by major financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This occurrence indicates that CDD checks are either not properly informed or have been subverted by those tasked with setting up front companies and bank accounts. The potential reasons for failure are numerous and could include malfeasance or negligence on the part of the financial institution, but could just as easily reflect the quality of the malign actors’ tradecraft and paperwork, taking advantage of weak supervision and controls in countries that turn a blind eye to the activities of rogue states such as Iran. Furthermore, CFSs are set up precisely to avoid interaction with the formal financial system and thus avoid even the most diligent private sector checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, as rogue states have their financial activity increasingly limited, financial institutions and those that monitor and audit their activities, as well as those that control and police the financial system, such as central banks and payment settlement systems, must clearly be more diligent if there is any chance of restricting these CFSs as they develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Western financial institutions seek to raise their game, particular challenges must be overcome. For example, those regulated entities charged with monitoring transactions and screening clients rely on measures to identify unusual patterns that do not match expected account conduct and/or have transactional links to those entities that have already been designated under sanctions regimes. These measures take time to have an effect, however, because the platforms require ongoing streams of data to identify unusual or suspicious patterns, and even then are far from fool-proof, having a reputation both for generating a high proportion of false positives and missing well-disguised false negatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further difficulties are potentially created by the internal operational “split” within banks between sanctions screening and transaction monitoring. The identification of a sanctions match will lead to the suspension of a transaction and a report to a national sanctions administrator, but this relies on screening revealing a link to a designated individual or entity. If no such link is identified, transactional activity might be identified separately as unusual or suspicious, but not necessarily sanctions related. The sanctions evasion activity might therefore be filed instead as a suspicious activity/transaction report (SAR or STR, depending on the country) to a national financial intelligence unit (FIU). Whether the potential sanctions-related aspects are identified is uncertain, and likely to depend on the effectiveness of an individual national FIU’s data analytics and channels for intelligence sharing with other agencies, including the sanctions administrator. Although the capacity of FIUs will vary between countries, available evidence suggests that the majority of SARs/STRs received by many FIUs, even in the developed world, are not immediately exploited, serving instead as a secondary database for investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These basic weaknesses in the system can be exacerbated further by contextual factors at a national level. Some countries that have become central to sanctions circumvention activity have a weak record of implementing anti-financial crime measures, both in the public and private sectors. The UAE, which has been a primary jurisdiction for the establishment of Iranian front companies and has emerged as a hub for Russian investment and financial activity since the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, was added to the FATF’s list of “Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring” (so-called “grey list”) in March 2022 for its failure to take effective action against a range of financial crimes, including terrorist financing. Turkey, another common presence in Iranian sanctions circumvention trading schemes, has also been on the FATF grey list since October 2021, under a requirement to address fundamental failings in the policing of its financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is noticeable, moreover, how many front companies in Iranian schemes are based in major Asian trading entrepôts such as Hong Kong, which boast large numbers of small import/export firms. Although this might be a coincidence, it is plausible that these firms are set up in locations where they are much more likely to be able to hide in plain sight. By leveraging these permissive environments, rogue states and their agents can gain access to the international finance system at its weak points, and from there move illicit funds throughout the legitimate system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-refocusing-the-system&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Refocusing the System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has sought to illuminate the ways in which rogue states, in particular Iran, develop alternative financial systems to circumvent Western sanctions and how a heavily sanctioned state such as Russia might adopt similar practices. It concludes by assessing how Western governments and their private sectors should strengthen and refocus their responses to confront the development of such CFSs by rogue states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the case studies in this paper have demonstrated, rogue state CFSs are consistent in the jurisdictions in which they choose to facilitate their activities. The tools used by the international community to improve national financial crime standards, notably FATF evaluations and (where necessary) greylisting, are clearly insufficient to address this malign activity, designed as they were with criminal finance in mind. As this paper has argued, a much greater focus needs to be placed on strengthening the whole financial system against this abuse, not only relying on the private sector but also involving greater commitment and effort from governments via their control of the financial infrastructure (such as clearing and settlement systems) and the development of new standards (such as expanded financial reporting) designed to address the threat from an expansion of CFSs by rogue states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international community’s response to illicit finance is built on the FATF and its standards, first developed in 1989 in response to the use of the formal financial system to support the laundering of the proceeds of the narcotics trade between South and North America. Over time, these standards have evolved, but their focus – aside from addressing the implementation of UN sanctions on states engaged in the proliferation of WMDs – has been on identifying and disrupting the proceeds of criminal activity (so-called “predicate offences”), rather than the activity of rogue states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the FATF, sanctions – whether applied on a multilateral basis by the UN or on a bilateral basis by individual states or groups of states – have been a cornerstone of the international community’s response to security threats for decades. The success of sanctions in coercing behavioural change is varied. In the case of Iran, some, such as the US Treasury, point to the role sanctions played in bringing the regime to the negotiation table to agree the 2015 JCPOA; yet Iran, labelled in 2019 by the US State Department as “the world’s worst state sponsor of terrorism”, has also been subject to terrorism-related sanctions for nearly 40 years, and has shown no sign of diminishing its funding and resourcing of designated terrorist organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this paper has reviewed, underpinning the response to sanctions of rogue states such as Iran is the development of complex CFSs that allow states to bypass those traditional financial mechanisms that are dominated by Western nations who seek to coerce changes in behaviour via sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many European countries, despite the existence of sanctions regimes for decades, it was not until the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine that the reality of sanctions implementation dawned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And herein lies the contradiction. Most European countries perform well in the evaluations undertaken of their anti-financial crime systems and controls by the FATF; yet their awareness of and engagement with the steps required to secure their financial systems against sanctions evasion contrasts poorly, primarily because they have not felt compelled to focus on sanctions implementation before 2022. This suggests that more specific focus and measures are needed to strengthen the financial system against sanctions evasion activity and related CFSs that go beyond mere FATF compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this need for greater awareness of sanctions evasion activity, the necessity to focus more diligently on sanctions implementation and identify systemic vulnerabilities that allow sanctioned jurisdictions to circumvent economic restrictions to continue funding their malign and threatening activity, including financing designated terrorist groups, this paper presents the following recommendations, focused in particular on European governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build on Russia sanctions collaboration.&lt;/strong&gt; Western unity on Russia sanctions, together with Asian allies, has been notable since February 2022. While gaps between regimes need to be addressed, commitment to designating entities and restricting relevant Russian economic activity has been strong. Allied nations need to build on this unity to ensure that other rogue states that abuse the financial system are presented with an equally united front to ensure gaps in the responses (notably provided by countries that are well known for their weak compliance with global standards) are not arbitraged by bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acknowledge the threat posed by parallel financial systems.&lt;/strong&gt; As the hegemony of the Western-controlled financial system weakens, Western countries must be alert to the development of parallel financial systems that allow for sanctions circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educate the private sector.&lt;/strong&gt; Driven by the rising awareness of growing Russian attempts to circumvent sanctions, significantly greater effort must be made by Western governments to raise awareness of the sanctions evasion methods and activities of rogue states. Typologies – such as those in the US government Tri-Seal Compliance Note – are not sufficiently specific. Details of sanctions designations must be actively used, along with the provision of other open source case studies, to inform the private sector of the specifics of CFSs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FATF is only part of the solution.&lt;/strong&gt; Even where states have received strong reviews from the FATF, they should recognise that FATF-related anti-financial crime responses provide only part of the solution for addressing rogue state activity, as it is a system designed primarily to respond to the proceeds of crime, not the development of CFSs. Although FATF pressure is helpful for raising financial crime standards in general, its sanctions-related focus is narrowly defined and thus fails to address those sanctions regimes that are not based on UNSC resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review financial infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; Governments are, for the most part, responsible for key elements of the financial system, such as banking settlement systems (TARGET2 for the Euro area, for example). Although it is unrealistic for these systems to monitor transactions in the way required by commercial banks, greater scrutiny must be applied to the standards of those banks that access these systems. Just as correspondent banks are required to ensure the compliance standards of their client banks, so too should clearing and settlement systems satisfy themselves that those using their services have appropriate controls and policies in place to defend against abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify sanctions evasion platforms.&lt;/strong&gt; This paper has highlighted the way in which platforms such as the ACU could be used to facilitate sanctions evasion. Western governments should ensure they are aware of and securing against this potential repurposing of such platforms, for example by highlighting these risks to those providing banking and settlement services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen reporting requirements.&lt;/strong&gt; Recognising the growth in sanctions evasion activity, government-mandated private sector reporting requirements (such as those Iran-related reporting requirements policed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission – SEC) must be updated to reflect the greater risk of abuse from rogue states. For example, following the lead of the SEC, European regulators should introduce specific reporting requirements related to “high-risk” countries such as Russia and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review competency of EU member state sanctions architecture.&lt;/strong&gt; As research has identified, sanctions implementation capabilities across Europe vary considerably. The EU should apply greater scrutiny to and auditing of these capabilities and consider the introduction of an EU-level authority responsible for ensuring harmonisation and high standards of EU sanctions implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empower the private sector and clarify responsibilities.&lt;/strong&gt; For many in the private sector, sanctions are a compliance challenge. But as frontline actors, the private sector, particularly large globally operating banks, have a central role to play in ensuring compliance of financial systems in lower-capacity countries by using their leverage over these actors to ensure their compliance with financial restrictive measures. Furthermore, as the threat from CFSs rises, clearly private sector responsibility should be apportioned to ensure the right actors are engaged in the challenge of identifying and disrupting this form of emerging sanctions evasion. Too often it is left to the banks to act as the sole element of the financial frontline. Other actors such as auditors should feel equal responsibility to ensure a systemic response to the threat posed by rogue states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, as rogue states grow in number and have their financial activity increasingly limited, financial institutions and those that monitor and audit their activities, as well as those that control and police the financial system, such as central banks and payment settlement systems, must clearly be more diligent and alert to the threat posed by CFSs. This challenge will grow significantly as allied nations continue to tighten financial and trade restrictions on Russia. Merely relying on the traditional methods designed to respond to the proceeds of crime will not be sufficient to identify and disrupt this activity. New thinking, new approaches and new capabilities will be needed if those seeking to secure the financial system against rogue state abuse are to stand a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, Saudi Arabia has attracted international attention with one diplomatic initiative after another – from its beginning of normalisation with Iran, to peace talks with the Yemeni Houthis, to the reintegration of Syria into the Arab League, to efforts to broker a ceasefire in Sudan, to hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the Arab League Summit in Jeddah in mid-May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media coverage under headlines like ‘Saudi Arabia’s journey from troublemaker to diplomat’ seems to suggest that this is the result of some sort of recent about-face in Saudi foreign policy. In reality, however, it reflects a coming to the fore of what has long been the Kingdom’s preferred approach to foreign affairs. It highlights an evolution in how Saudi Arabia is positioning itself and operating on the regional and international stage, but without indicating a change in the country’s strategic direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary objectives of Saudi foreign policy has always been to counter and contain instability in the Middle East in order to keep threats at bay, limit risks to the free flow of oil exports from the Gulf and facilitate the Kingdom’s domestic economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the rise to power of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the mid-2010s, this has become even more explicit. Riyadh’s number-one priority is the implementation of Vision 2030, the hugely ambitious socio-economic reform programme that is supposed to transform Saudi Arabia into a modern, globally integrated knowledge economy which is less and less reliant on its hydrocarbon riches. The primary task for Saudi foreign policy is to support and enable this process, not least by reducing the threats posed to the Vision by instability or conflict in Saudi Arabia’s neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various actions during the early years of the Mohammed bin Salman era that earned Saudi Arabia a lot of international criticism and a reputation for imperious foreign policy adventurism were driven by this same objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Yemen, Saudi Arabia saw the Houthis as posing an unacceptable threat to its national security that it hoped to remove with a short and decisive military intervention. But Saudi Arabia both underestimated the Houthis and overestimated its own military capabilities, and since its start in 2015, the conflict has essentially become the Kingdom’s own ‘forever war’, one which it is increasingly eager to extricate itself from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diplomatic and economic boycott that Saudi Arabia and others in the region imposed on Qatar in 2017 was supposed to rein in Doha’s regional activism, which Riyadh regarded as undermining regional stability. But Qatar proved to be more resilient than anticipated, and most countries around the world – including Saudi Arabia’s partners in the West – regarded the rift between the Gulf monarchies as an entirely unnecessary irritant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The November 2017 attempt to pressure then-Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri to resign in protest against Hezbollah and Iranian interference was part of a wider Saudi effort to push back against what Riyadh saw as Tehran’s malign and destabilising behaviour across the region. But the move only sparked international controversy and outrage, while Iranian influence grew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Saudi Arabia is not looking to substitute Beijing for Washington – it has no illusions that China would want or be able to become the main guarantor of maritime security in the Gulf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as international observers could assess that these and other Saudi actions did not lead to the desired outcomes, decision-makers in Riyadh – including Mohammed bin Salman – will likely also have concluded that their approach was not working. This was also helped by the fact that Mohammed bin Salman had increasingly identified capable and trusted individuals for key positions, including his brother Khalid bin Salman at the Ministry of Defence (as Deputy Minister since 2019 and Minister since 2022) and Prince Faisal bin Farhan as Minister of Foreign Affairs (since 2019).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sense that something needed to change was further reinforced by an increasing disillusionment with US policy towards the region. Ups and downs in the bilateral relationship between Riyadh and Washington are nothing new, but over the past two decades, Saudi Arabia has grown ever more doubtful of the US’s commitment to upholding the Middle East’s basic regional order. The George W Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq, and the Obama administration’s pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran over the heads of Saudi Arabia and other regional countries, were key moments in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most important moment came in September 2019. A drone and missile attack on some of the Kingdom’s most important oil installations in Abqaiq and Khurais, which was widely attributed to Iran, painfully demonstrated Saudi Arabia’s vulnerability in any potential military confrontation with the Islamic Republic. More importantly, the lack of a decisive US response to the attack was taken as a sign that Washington could not be relied upon to stand up for the Kingdom’s security, or even for the security of the oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years since, Saudi Arabia has recalibrated its foreign policy, continuing to focus on the same overall objective of supporting Vision 2030, but looking to leverage Saudi instruments of power in a more patient and pragmatic manner. This includes trying out new approaches to existing challenges while being prepared for the fact that they might not work out, and working with alternative partners where suitable, even in the face of criticism from Washington or other Western capitals. Riyadh remains open to collaborating with the US – as is evident from the current joint Saudi-US mediation efforts in Sudan – but in areas where it feels that the US has adopted an unhelpful position or is not sufficiently engaged, it is prepared to go it alone or to solicit help from China or others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much ink has been spilled over the past year about the state of the US-Saudi relationship, with many interpreting Riyadh’s dealings with Beijing or Moscow as specifically directed against Washington or signifying an attempt to move away from the West’s orbit and towards the East. From Riyadh’s perspective, however, this is not what it is trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia is not looking to substitute Beijing for Washington – it certainly has no illusions that China or any other country would want or be able to take on the mantle of being the main guarantor of maritime security in the Gulf, which has been worn by the US Fifth Fleet for decades. It still sees the US and – to a lesser extent – the UK and France as its most important defence partners, and still sees Western economies as key sources of inspiration, technology and investment for making Vision 2030 a reality. The West also remains the favoured destination for investments by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, without wanting to put any of this in jeopardy, Riyadh is also looking to expand ties with China, which it increasingly regards as a strategic partner capable of much more than buying up large quantities of Saudi oil – particularly with regard to technology transfer; and with Russia, which Saudi Arabia sees as an indispensable partner in trying to manage and influence international oil markets within the context of OPEC+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Saudi Arabia is trying put itself in a position in which it can have constructive relations with everyone – including global powers that are at odds with one another – and in which disputes on specific issues do not have to lead to ruptures in relations, but can be tolerated by agreeing to disagree. This is also the posture Saudi Arabia has adopted with regard to regional affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Buoyed by impressive economic growth and a sense that its international image has mostly recovered from the crisis of the late 2010s, Saudi Arabia feels that things are going its way&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2017–2021 dispute with Qatar was not so much resolved as simply declared to be a thing of the past. Riyadh and Doha still do not see eye to eye on everything, but there seems to be a mutual acceptance of the need to look for ways to work together while managing disagreements quietly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia has entered the process of normalising relations with Iran without any illusions that the regime in Tehran and its destabilising regional agenda have changed or will fundamentally change anytime soon. Instead, it hopes that China will exert sufficient influence over Iran to reduce risks to security in the Gulf and secure Iranian buy-in for de-escalation of the war in Yemen. At the same time, Riyadh is looking to improve its ability to defend itself against future Iranian attacks, while making a long-term bet that the success of its domestic socio-economic reforms will eventually inspire change in Arab countries dominated by Iran and, ultimately, in Iran itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Yemen, Saudi Arabia has – however begrudgingly – accepted that the Houthis cannot be militarily defeated for now. Working with trusted interlocutors like Oman, and hoping for Chinese influence to restrain Iran, it is therefore trying to arrive at a new modus operandi with the group, which remains in control of the Yemeni capital of Sanaa and much of the northern part of the country. It wants to secure a permanent end to cross-border attacks – especially the missile and drone strikes that threaten Saudi cities and tarnish the Kingdom’s image as an attractive place to invest and do business – and adopt a position as the main mediator between all Yemeni factions, including the Houthis and those aligned within the fragile Presidential Council arrangement. Here, it would also like the UN to be involved again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to Syria, Saudi Arabia has essentially embraced and supercharged an initiative put forward by Jordan to re-engage Damascus in order to address pressing challenges. Based on a sense that the West has lost all interest in Syria now that the threat from Islamic State has been contained and overall levels of violence have decreased, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and others have come to the conclusion that they have no other option but to engage with the Assad regime in order to deal with Syrian refugee populations (a major concern for Jordan) and – most immediately – the flow of drugs from Syria, for which un- and underemployed young people across the Arab world, and especially in the Gulf, are a significant customer base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, of course, what kind of concessions Saudi Arabia and its partners can actually elicit from the Syrian regime, for which the drug trade appears to be a primary source of income. The normalisation process is supposed to follow a step-for-step approach, but thus far Damascus appears to have offered next to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the outcomes of all of these diplomatic initiatives by Saudi Arabia are highly uncertain. Much of it is simply outside the Kingdom’s control – from China’s actual willingness and ability to exert influence over Tehran, to the machinations of the various components of the Iranian and Syrian regimes, to the readiness of the Houthis to abandon years of intransigence. On the global stage, too, Saudi Arabia may want to be able to freely develop and expand its relations with all major powers at the same time, but it would find it very difficult indeed to navigate a world in which the US and China were to tie their own willingness to deal with the Kingdom to Riyadh shunning the other power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the moment, Saudi Arabia’s answers to such questions reflect its self-confidence. Buoyed by impressive economic growth on the back of windfall oil revenues and a sense that its international image – and that of its Crown Prince – has mostly recovered from the crisis of the late 2010s, Saudi Arabia feels that things are going its way. It insists that it is in a strong enough position – as the world’s leading oil exporter, a G20 member with the ambition to soon be among the world’s top 15 economies, and the Arab and Islamic world’s centre of gravity – to chart its own course and to resist any pressure to choose sides. And in the region, it feels that even if its own initiatives might not be perfect, they are at least better than what anyone else has come up with in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, should things fall apart, Saudi Arabia and its foreign policy will continue to adjust. What will remain the same, however, is Riyadh’s central mantra: doing whatever it takes to secure the ongoing development and modernisation effort at home.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官裁定「共謀者原則」不適用於《國安法》生效前言行&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EvWS8gA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（2日）踏入審訊第62天。控辯雙方就「共謀者原則」作法律爭議3日後，3名《國安法》指定法官今裁定，「共謀者原則」只適用於2020年7月1日《國安法》生效後的共謀者言行，而《國安法》前的共謀者言行並不能納為該原則下的證據，只能以非傳聞證據的用途呈堂，意味不能依賴相關言行所述為事實來指證各被告參與本案串謀。而對辯方反對將匿名證人就新西協調會議的片段和錄音呈堂，法官指相關證據與本案有關，無充分理由拒絕呈堂，但同裁定僅可用作非傳聞證據的用途，詳細理由押後頒布。控方表示案情完結，林卓廷、黃碧雲、何桂藍及吳政亨表示擬申請毋須答辯，法官下令雙方呈交書面陳詞，並押至下周四（8日）處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官裁定國安法前言行不能納為共謀者原則下證據-包括匿名證人新西會議片段&quot;&gt;法官裁定《國安法》前言行不能納為「共謀者原則」下證據 包括匿名證人新西會議片段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3名《國安法》指定法官今裁定，共謀者於2020年7月1日《國安法》生效前的言行並不能納為「共謀者原則」下的證據，但仍可以非傳聞證據的用途（non-hearsay purpose）呈堂。至於《國安法》生效後的共謀者言行，法官認為已滿足案例列明的條件，故「共謀者原則」適用。法官並強調，現時只處理證據呈堂性的問題，但就證據的比重未下任何決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 早前反對匿名證人X的錄音和片段呈堂。法官今裁定，基於上述決定，相關證據亦不能在「共謀者原則」下呈堂，但仍可以非傳聞證據的用途呈堂；並指相關證據與考慮本案控罪有關，沒有充分理由運用酌情權剔除。法官會押後頒布詳細理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指引共謀者原則目的為證涉案言行真實性-辯方稱有相應門檻須符合&quot;&gt;控方指引「共謀者原則」目的為證涉案言行真實性 辯方稱有相應門檻須符合&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方本周處理「共謀者原則」的法律爭議，涉控方能否引用「傳聞證據」指證各被告。「傳聞證據」指「聽人講」的證據，即「某人告訴法庭另一人曾對他說過什麼」。一般而言，考慮到相關證據未必可靠也未經盤問，「傳聞證據」在刑事審訊中不可呈堂，即不能依賴所述內容為真確來指證被告。但某些情況例外，如在「共謀者原則」下，其他共謀者的言行即使是「傳聞證據」，也可用作指證各被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;綜合連日陳詞，辯方稱引用「共謀者原則」的前提為有證據顯示涉案串謀存在、亦有「獨立及合理的證據」顯示被告為串謀一分子，以及相關言行是為推動該串謀而進行；而被告加入串謀前的證據僅能顯示串謀的性質和範圍，只有此後的證據才能顯示被告的參與程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案中不少證據均屬傳聞證據，包括戴耀廷的文章、控方證人轉述戴耀廷的說法、前民主動力總幹事黎敬輝向趙家賢發出的協調會議筆記等，當中不少均於《國安法》生效前發生。辯方曾強調，《國安法》前的言行不構成任何罪行，「共謀者原則」並不適用；但控方指被告當時已涉串謀公職人員行為失當，具有非法的共同目的，故「共謀者原則」也適用於當時的言行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官曾指，即使沒有「共謀者原則」，《國安法》生效前的言行仍可作為背景或環境證供推論被告的犯罪意圖和思想狀態，及串謀的性質範圍。控方同意，但強調望引用該原則證明共謀者的言行內容屬實，以指證被告參與串謀。而根據法庭今天的裁定，即意味《國安法》前共謀者的言行，例如區諾軒引述戴耀廷稱已將協議文件發給參與者、趙家賢稱獲戴確認新東第二次會議曾投票通過「會運用」否決權、黎敬輝的協調會議筆記、新西協調會議的片段等，相關說法或內容都不能被視為真實以證明被告參與本案串謀；只能用作非傳聞證據的用途，如證明戴耀廷和黎敬輝的確有如此說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/k3J0CRQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指已完成案情-黃碧雲等擬申毋須答辯-押下周四陳詞&quot;&gt;控方指已完成案情 黃碧雲等擬申毋須答辯 押下周四陳詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官宣布決定後，控方表示已完成控方案情，黃碧雲、林卓廷及何桂藍一方均表示擬作中段陳詞，要求毋須答辯（no case to answer），即爭議本案表面證供不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文預計書面陳詞有40頁，惟法官陳慶偉指太長，亦認為沈指預計在下周五（9日）作口頭陳詞所需時間太長。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 則指其陳詞會在10頁以內，陳慶偉指這正是他打算設下的頁數上限。代表吳政亨的大律師梁麗幗則指需時索取指示，吳或會要求毋須答辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉最後表示，各被告的書面陳詞不可多於10頁，並須於下周一（5日）前呈交控方及法庭，控方則須於下周三（7日）前呈交不多於30頁的回應，雙方於下周四（8日）作口頭陳詞。陳強調就頁數限制已是「非常慷慨（very generous）」，李運騰亦指若真的證據不足，辯方無需長篇幅交代，「你說得越多，機會就越少。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸一度指，得悉沈士文的陳詞會提及有關法律的議題，望能保留對相關裁決的權利。法官質疑若他要作申請便提出，陳仲衡亦指「你不能做 freerider」，李運騰並指若法庭有相關裁決會適用於所有人，但現時尚未是時候處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑控方花時間在無用證據上-控方致歉&quot;&gt;官質疑控方花時間在無用證據上 控方致歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方昨傳召一名警方社交媒體專家證人，就戴耀廷一則 Facebook 帖文作供，但由於他作供逾半小時，比起原先稱的5分鐘用更多時間，遭法官批評。署理助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋今早甫開庭指，沒有其他問題向該警員發問。法官陳慶偉質疑為何控方要傳召該名警員，羅指因相關部分未納為同意事實，惟法官李運騰指似乎該部分僅對辯方有利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉語帶不滿問：「為何需要花近一小時在無用的證據上？」在延伸庭的黃之鋒及吳敏兒均發笑。陳慶偉又向控方強調：「聽住，你要注視在整體大局上（look at the big picture）」，並問有關證據如何協助控方案情。此時副刑事檢控專員周天行站起代為回答，指由於該帖文提及同意運用否決權，而戴耀廷向參與者發出後獲回應，控方望依賴相關回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉不耐煩重申：「要看整體大局，而非只看微小的事情（“Look at the big picture, not only look at one tiny tiny tiny matter.”）」，周天行指有全面看，惟陳即追問：「那為何你會容許你的下屬（junior）在這方面花近一個小時？你是本案的主控！是你作出決定！」周天行遂向法官道歉，但陳慶偉不滿道：「這是沒有用的」，並指不能每次犯錯都只是道歉，但之後又繼續犯錯，延伸庭的吳敏兒及譚凱邦不禁發笑。周天行回應會善用相關證據，陳慶偉指對那不感興趣，並着他住口及坐下：「Shut up and sit down please!」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1zPCYMM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周四（8日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hkY6S1x.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（1日）踏入審訊第61天。控方今應法官要求提交列表，說明本案串謀形成、及各被告和共謀者加入串謀的時間。控方重申本案串謀於2020年1月飯局由區諾軒和戴耀廷形成，惟法官質疑區諾軒當時並無同意戴耀廷運用否決權的主張。控方又指，鄭達鴻出席公民黨記者會、公民黨以黨名義簽「墨落無悔」均可顯示鄭參與串謀，惟法官質疑並非所有公民黨黨員都是共謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方指前民主動力總幹事黎敬輝於參與協調會議時加入串謀，指會上談及否決預算案，黎知悉下仍多次出席會議和設計提名表格。惟法官質疑，黎只是受薪工作，不代表同意會上說法；又舉例法官受僱於司法機構才須每天出席審訊，但不代表同意控方說法，強調「單單知情從不足以令人成為串謀一分子」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方列表包括傳聞證供-官指不能用以顯示串謀存在&quot;&gt;控方列表包括傳聞證供 官指不能用以顯示串謀存在&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方本周就「共謀者原則」作法律爭議，法官陳慶偉昨要求控方提交列表，列明本案串謀形成，及各被告和共謀者加入串謀顛覆國家政權的日期。控方今早向法庭及辯方提交列表，當中控方須有獨立證據證明被告參與串謀，才能援引「共謀者原則」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰甫開庭先指出，文件有部分段落顯示為藍色，示意為傳聞證據（hearsay evidence），該些證據須引「共謀者原則」才能呈堂；法官陳仲衡亦指，要顯示被告加入串謀便須有該些證據外的獨立證據。周天行指若然如此，可以不理會相關部分。法官陳慶偉其後指，控方不能同時用相關言行顯示串謀的存在，又再引「共謀者原則」指該些言行證明了其他共謀者說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱串謀於2020年1月形成-官質疑區諾軒無同意戴耀廷稱否決財案&quot;&gt;控方稱串謀於2020年1月形成 官質疑區諾軒無同意戴耀廷稱否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就串謀於何時形成，李運騰關注控方是否準確反映本案證據，舉例控方指由於2020年1月的飯局上戴耀廷提及「大殺傷力憲制武器」，故串謀當時已由戴耀廷和區諾軒形成。惟李指據他記憶，區諾軒無提及於飯局已同意戴耀廷稱運用否決權迫特首下台，區是在後來才意識到計劃的目的，區也沒被問及1月時是否已形成協議。周天行指最終會由法庭決定給予區諾軒證供多少比重，但認為表面上（prima facie）在飯局時，戴耀廷有與區諾軒談及否決權或「攬炒」，區在飯局後亦有作出一連串行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lzy4F3o.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 副刑事檢控專員(III) 周天行&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉即指，區只是同意為35+計劃進行協調的行政工作，認為計劃只是為爭取立會過半才同意參與；而當時亦未決定是否採用公民投票。陳續指，區明確提及5月5日第二次新東會議後才有「風向轉變」，參與者始關注否決預算案的議題，而區稱一直不同意戴耀廷，只是沒提出反對。陳並語帶嚴厲問控方：「因此你怎能說2020年1月，串謀已經形成？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行回應，是依賴區諾軒一直知悉否決預算案的想法。陳慶偉指區或者知悉，「但我不關心他是否知悉，我關心他何時加入串謀。」周重申是2020年1月底。李運騰終無奈指：「如果這已是你能做到的最好，那就這樣吧。（“If that is the best that you can do, then so be it.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱鄭達鴻325公民黨記者會已加入串謀-稱顯示充分知悉黨立場-官質疑僅舉紙牌&quot;&gt;控方稱鄭達鴻3.25公民黨記者會已加入串謀 稱顯示充分知悉黨立場 官質疑僅舉紙牌&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續提到，控方指鄭達鴻於3月25日公民黨記者會已加入串謀，並列出另外7個後備日期。李指該記者會是否「35+計劃」的一部分有待決定，陳慶偉亦指記者會上「鄭達鴻除了拿着紙牌站在那裏，什麼都沒有做」。周指「至少能顯示他充分知悉（fully aware）公民黨的立場」，惟李指除了「知悉」，控方亦須有鄭以行動支持該說法的證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉亦指：「每個讀過戴耀廷文章的人都會知道他的意圖，但他們有沒有加入（串謀）？」周續解釋，控方並非只依賴3月的證據，亦依賴鄭達鴻之後的一連串行為，以讓法庭推斷他最早於3月已加入串謀。而對控方指鄭3月26日出席港島首次協調會議顯示參與串謀，陳慶偉質疑會上雖提出否決預算案，但司馬文提出反對，沒有達成共識，「你怎能說鄭達鴻於3月26日加入了串謀？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方承認無直接證據鄭達鴻收到協議文件&quot;&gt;控方承認無直接證據鄭達鴻收到協議文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦提及，5月19日港島初選參選人已就協議的字眼達成共識，戴耀廷並於6月8日將協議發出組織者群組。李運騰問有否證據顯示鄭達鴻於5月19日收到該份文件，周說可以作推論。李指區諾軒只是聽到戴耀廷稱已傳閱文件，追問控方基於什麼推論，周指是因鄭有出席會議。惟李笑指，區也曾稱協議文件不一定是會議的決議，只是戴耀廷嘗試加諸他人身上的個人意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周在追問下，指可據6月8日戴耀廷發出的文件推論鄭有收到文件，惟同意鄭達鴻不在組織者群組，但指可顯示各區已達成共識，林卓廷輕聲說「嘩」。周最後承認並沒有直接證據鄭收到該文件，重申依賴法庭推斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱公民黨簽墨落顯示鄭達鴻加入串謀-官反問是否所有公民黨員都是共謀者&quot;&gt;控方稱公民黨簽「墨落」顯示鄭達鴻加入串謀 官反問是否所有公民黨員都是共謀者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續引列表，指公民黨於6月11日簽署「墨落無悔」聲明書，但問為何控方指公民黨簽署就等於鄭達鴻加入了串謀。周天行答因鄭是公民黨黨員，惟李運騰問：「那是否代表所有公民黨黨員都變成了共謀者？當然不是。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問，控方立場是否指鄭於3月25日成了共謀者，而其他日子的證據均是讓法庭用作推論。周起初否認，陳慶偉續再追問，周一度望着法官靜默，陳說「不要望着我」。周續同意，列表上所有證據均可用以推論鄭達鴻於3月25日已加入串謀，而若法庭不同意該日期，則可採納之後的後備日期，而所有證據均可用來佐證。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問有何證據黎敬輝為共謀者-指黎屬民動總幹事設計提名表格屬工作&quot;&gt;官問有何證據黎敬輝為共謀者 指黎屬民動總幹事、設計提名表格屬工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方亦指前觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻、前民主動力總幹事黎敬輝，及前公民黨立法會議員郭榮鏗為共謀者。就黎敬輝，控方指他於3月26日首次港島協調會議加入串謀。惟李運騰指，黎只是被趙家賢要求出席會議，問除了他在場抄筆記外，還有沒有其他獨立證據顯示他是串謀的一分子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行指黎也是民主動力總幹事。李運騰即笑說：「但這是他的工作。」周回應，即使協調會議有談及否決預算案，黎仍多次（repeatedly）出席會議。陳慶偉即提高聲調說：「這是他的工作！他的工作！他必須在那裡！拜託！（“It’s his job! His job! He has to be there! Please!”」周天行指黎也有設計提名表格，李運騰指那不代表他同意當中內容。陳慶偉亦指黎是民主動力總幹事、是唯一的全職員工，「如果不是他設計，那由誰設計？」周回應表格有顯示計劃的「共識」，惟陳指那是另一議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再追問還有什麼證據顯示黎是共謀者，周指「基本上這就是我們的所有證據」，陳再語帶不耐煩，語氣稍重說：「聽着！因為我是香港政府司法機構的員工，所以我才每天要來這裡，記錄你說的話」，李運騰亦指「不代表我們同意你的說法」。周僅重申是因黎有出席協調會議，陳慶偉再大聲問：「除了那以外，還有什麼？」周再答：「那就是我們所有的。（“I think that is all we have.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰總結，控方立場是否即由於黎出席會議，為35+計劃提供支援，所以他自願支持整個計劃，周同意，亦同意法官指趙家賢曾稱民主動力工作報告是由職員所撰寫，故不僅依賴黎出席會議來顯示他為共謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱黎敬輝僅會議出席者單單知情不足以成為串謀一分子&quot;&gt;官稱黎敬輝僅會議出席者、單單知情不足以成為串謀一分子&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方指黎敬輝於3月26日首次港島會議加入串謀，李運騰重申當天會上戴耀廷雖談及否決預算案，但對此無共識，「他（黎敬輝）可能聽過（戴耀廷說法），但這令他成為串謀一分子嗎？」，指聽過不代表同意，陳仲衡亦指黎也有聽到會上反對運用否決權的看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周續指，黎有出席的5月8日新西會議上「會運用」獲一致通過，惟李運騰再指黎嚴格來說並非計劃參與者（participant），只是會議出席者（attendee）。周重申因黎「一直都知道（否決預算案的想法）」，惟李強調「單單知情從不足以令人成為串謀一分子（“Knowledge alone is never sufficient to make one a party to conspiracy.”）」，周天行同意，並指是依賴一連串行為來推論黎參與了串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問郭榮鏗於35角色指郭無參加初選-控方指曾出席宣傳初選街站&quot;&gt;官問郭榮鏗於35+角色、指郭無參加初選 控方指曾出席宣傳初選街站&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於郭榮鏗，控方同指他於3月25日公民黨記者會加入串謀。李運騰問，除了他在場並支持會上發言，他在整個「35+計劃」有何角色？直言「他從沒參與任何協調會議、從沒參加初選」。周天行指郭於該記者會上發言、亦是公民黨一員，其後公民黨也有簽署「墨落無悔」。李重申並非所有公民黨員都成為共謀者，周指他不是說所有黨員都是，李追問那為何要單獨挑出郭，周再重複指因郭在記者會上發言，並於7月12日出席公民黨街站。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由於今早始收到控方列表，辯方表示需時準備，押後約一小時作出回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Q5E0fgP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，踏入審訊第61天。控方應法官要求交代各被告和共謀者加入串謀的時間，並列出可顯示被告參與串謀的證據。惟多名辯方大狀均指相關證據不充分，亦強調本案不曾達成無差別否決預算案的協議，只是從政者嘗試參與初選和表達一些主張，即使有協議也只是同意舉行初選為民主派爭勝算。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中吳政亨被控方指為組織者，其代表大狀強調吳雖與戴耀廷有聯繫並發起「三投三不投」約束初選參選人，但吳僅着重團結民主派，無意加入戴耀廷無差別否決預算案的串謀，與戴耀廷即使達成協議，也與本案協議不同。法官周五（2日）將就控方能否援引「共謀者原則」作出裁決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方提名表格和收據無說明各區確實達成之共識-不足以顯示參與串謀&quot;&gt;辯方：提名表格和收據無說明各區確實達成之共識 不足以顯示參與串謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今應法官要求提交各被告和共謀者加入串謀日期的列表，遭法官多番質疑，辯方其後進行回應。代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文重申，《國安法》生效前的共謀者言行不能在「共謀者原則」下指證各被告，如要應用該原則便須先有獨立合理證據證明有串謀存在。而該原則如適用，則以被告加入串謀的日子為分界，此前的傳聞證據（hearsay evidence）均不得在該原則下呈堂，僅能顯示串謀的性質和範圍，只有此後的證據才能顯示被告的參與程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈並指，控方依賴被告報名初選的提名表格和按金收據作為各被告參與串謀的證據，但該兩份文件本身並沒有說明各區確實達成的共識，不足以證明被告參與串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方搜林卓廷筆記提積極運用否決權-辯方稱或有他人準備初選論壇言論相反&quot;&gt;控方搜林卓廷筆記提積極運用否決權 辯方稱或有他人準備、初選論壇言論相反&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方指從林卓廷家搜得「初選Debate Notes」可顯示他參與串謀，當中就會否反對預算案，筆記稱「胡志偉一再公開回應話會積極運用」和「其實我立法會四年沒有贊成過財政預算案」。沈士文指筆記從沒被使用，可能由他人準備，即使由林準備也可能只是草稿或出錯；又指林在初選論壇表明若政府建醫院和學校就不會否決預算案，直言不能顯示林同意該筆記內容。李運騰表示控方或指可從所有證據作推論，惟沈指那是不能接受。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於控方指從黃碧雲電腦搜得九龍西的協議文件，沈指不代表是由戴耀廷發給她。李運騰指若黃有該文件，或能推論她是知悉文件內容下報名參加初選，合理推論她參與串謀，惟沈認為仍不足夠；沈亦指，黃沒有如控方稱出席首次九西協調會議，據區諾軒稱會議亦無就否決財案達成共識，而黃於初選論壇僅稱可用不同《基本法》權力爭取五大訴求，無證據她同意無差別否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱初選僅從政者表達主張無達成協議公民黨簽墨落不代表鄭達鴻認同&quot;&gt;辯方稱初選僅從政者表達主張無達成協議、公民黨簽「墨落」不代表鄭達鴻認同&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸則重申，區諾軒作供時稱與戴耀廷的「初心」不同，無明確證據協議何時形成。他亦認為公民黨簽署「墨落無悔」不能代表鄭達鴻，指所有其他參與者均以個人名義簽署，只有公民黨以黨名義簽署，背後一定有原因。黃又指鄭只是在3月25日公民黨記者會上站着舉紙牌，不足以證明當時已加入串謀。惟陳慶偉指，若鄭於會上只是單單站着望向某處，可接受他未必同意會上內容，李運騰補充或者他搖頭示意；陳仲衡亦指需考慮所有因素，包括鄭參與初選等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃宇逸強調，本案任何階段均沒有達成涉案串謀協議，只是從政者嘗試參與初選和表達一些主張，李運騰笑指即是他們說出誇大的話而沒有意圖實踐，黃笑言「基本上那是所有從政者做的事」，李稱不肯定他的當事人會否同意。黃亦指，無證據鄭達鴻和梁國雄收到協議文件，而控方有關郭榮鏗是共謀者的證據薄弱（flimsy），李運騰回應法庭會仔細審視控方依賴的每則證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良則指，控方依賴趙家賢稱楊出席首次港島會議，惟趙當天遲到早走，相反區諾軒負責協調該區，記憶較可靠，而區稱楊僅派代表出席。張又指，區稱港島所有會議均無就否決財案達共識，惟法官陳慶偉不同意，指由於司馬文反對運用否決權而退出初選，可見會上一定有達成協議。但張表示對說法存疑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;多名辯方大狀均指本案沒有達成無差別否決預算案的協議，包括代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀和代表何啟明的大律師阮偉明。阮指即使有協議，也只是舉行初選爭取民主派立會勝算的協議。自行代表的劉偉聰亦反對控方所有指稱他加入串謀的日期，認為沒有任何獨立證據顯示他參與涉案串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表施德來的大律師黃廷光亦認為沒有任何串謀，也無證據證施參與串謀；並認為控方指為共謀者的蔡澤鴻情況與前民主動力總幹事黎敬輝相若，只是於35+計劃進行後勤（logistic）工作。惟法官李運騰不同意，認為蔡的參與更多，負責組織九東協調會議、發電郵、提供開會場地和協助主持會議，會後亦向與會者發送文件，非單純的與會者；又指蔡曾向組織者稱九東參選人望簽協議、否則會「兵變」，因此施德來等人才提交共同綱領。李運騰又問為何關注蔡澤鴻，指即使他非共謀者，若施與戴耀廷達成串謀協議，相關證據也可納入考慮；黃指若蔡非共謀者，其證據便不可用來指證參選九東的施。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑則表示，就控方援引4月14日會上鄒家成提及「要用盡方法去迫政府回應五大訴求」，只是趙家賢的證供，惟趙會上不專注，供詞與區諾軒和鍾錦麟不一致，若依賴或有疑慮。至於控方援引新東協議文件，陳指區諾軒亦不肯定是否如實反映各人共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就5月5日新東第二次會議，陳指會上或有激烈討論否決權，但最終投票不果。陳慶偉指是鄒家成要求投票，其他人不同意，「那不是反映他想加入戴耀廷的串謀嗎？」陳世傑回應控罪並非只指一兩個人串謀，而是所有被告。陳慶偉指那不重要，李運騰亦指只要有人與戴耀廷達成協議便可成立，與其他被告是否無辜無關。陳世傑另指，「墨落無悔」並無提倡無差別否決預算案，而提名表格列明要同意的亦僅限於協調會議上的共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方批控方列出後備日期讓法庭決定做法不能接受&quot;&gt;辯方批控方列出後備日期讓法庭決定做法不能接受&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑最後就控方列出後備日期的做法回應，認為控方應有清晰的立場，如說「Plan B」就是「Plan B」，而不是列出「Plan A至Z」，再讓法庭決定，指做法是不能接受，李運騰微笑說法庭今早已表達過相似的情緒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表李予信的大律師關文渭則指，部分控方證據為傳聞證供、不能接納，包括無證據李曾收過超級區議會的協議文件；就「公民黨」簽署「墨落無悔」也無清楚證據顯示何為公民黨，李運騰一度回應是已通過清盤的政黨。關又指在6月的公民黨街站李予信沒有發言，惟法官指李當天在場或可證他支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指吳政亨與戴耀廷達成的協議與本案指控不同僅關注初選是否具約束力&quot;&gt;辯方指吳政亨與戴耀廷達成的協議與本案指控不同、僅關注初選是否具約束力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘則表示，控方以吳政亨與戴耀廷於3月的 WhatsApp 對話紀錄指吳參與串謀，但該些對話不能得出二人共同目的就是否決預算案。李運騰稱控方是指雖然吳沒參選，但透過發起「三投三不投」確保參選人服從協調機制，支持「35+計劃」；石書銘同意，但強調控方是指控被告同意無差別否決預算案，而上述證據或未能指向此，同意法官總結吳參與的串謀與本案控罪不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘其後援引吳政亨文章〈【初選聯署】立會有初選啦！但有無約束力？睇你簽唔簽名〉，提及「執筆之時，戴耀廷教授剛於訪問中透露直選協調進展」，又指「好消息當然是五區協調成功」。李運騰質疑若吳作為局外人，為何會得知發生何事；陳慶偉亦指文章提及「怎料，看了細節，比預期更佳！先前傳聞令一衆候選人爭持不下的『共同綱領』，也達到完滿結果。所有參與會議的五區候選人都同意簽署協議書『會（積極）運用』基本法賦予權力，包括否決財政預算案」，指吳似乎也讀過共同綱領。惟石指吳只是從戴耀廷訪問以及「先前傳聞」得知，吳亦沒有表明是否同意運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石又指，吳的重點是在團結民主派，而本案所有證據也顯示他只關注初選是否具約束力，沒有提過否決預算案。而他與戴耀廷最後一次 WhatsApp 對話是2020年7月3日，之後二人沒有對話，吳並於7月28日與戴講再見。惟法官李運騰指，吳政亨也在《蘋果日報》就初選登廣告並發給戴，亦曾就撰寫的新聞稿徵詢戴意見，並要求戴向其他參選人分發，戴回應已辦妥。石書銘強調，無論吳政亨和戴耀廷同意了什麼，也是與本案不同的另一個串謀，該協議的範圍也很有限。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後主動打比喻，假設三名法官計劃打劫銀行，而他的書記雖然不認識其餘兩人、也不知計劃細節，但得悉大概的計劃後與陳達成協議，同意為陳買車和擔任司機，那書記是否本案的共謀者？二人的串謀協議與打劫計劃是否分開？並指書記可類比吳政亨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石回應被告要定罪不僅在於他知情、亦需同意該共同目的，惟吳政亨的情況不同。但陳仲衡指，石援引的文章正顯示吳知道35+是關於否決預算案；李運騰亦指被告不一定需「打劫」，只是參與整個計劃的一部分也可入罪。石重申吳無意加入戴耀廷無差別否決預算案的串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官周五就能否引共謀者原則頒決定&quot;&gt;法官周五就能否引「共謀者原則」頒決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉終表示，將於周五（2日）就能否援引「共謀者原則」作出裁決，其中黃碧雲、林卓廷、何啟明、何桂藍等或會視乎結果提出毋須答辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後應石書銘要求傳召一名警方社交媒體專家證人作盤問，控方亦另傳召一名警方社交媒體專家證人，就戴耀廷一則帖文作供。法官李運騰一度驚訝指以為控方已傳畢所有證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第二名證人，控方原稱只需5分鐘，惟最終該證人作供逾半小時仍未完成。陳慶偉面露不快，大聲叫控方問好問題，又質問控方為何只稱需5分鐘，並將案件押至明早續。&lt;/p&gt;

Victor Zhora, Deputy Chairman and Chief Digital Transformation Officer of the SSSCIP (the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine), provided his perspective on the lack of Russian success in the cyber domain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine, having long been targeted by Russian cyber operations, has been subject to an uptick in attacks both before and since the Russian invasion in February 2022. These can be divided into three types of cyber operations: cyber espionage that seeks to collect information and data; subversive operations including propaganda, influence and information operations; and destructive and disruptive operations – for example, those seeking to disrupt communications systems. Zhora’s contribution focused primarily on Russian destructive and disruptive operations against Ukraine and their limited success to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhora suggested that some key Russian accesses to Ukrainian networks were compromised before the February 2022 invasion. This denied Russia the ability to leverage these to deliver cyber operations. Attempts to secure new accesses are time-consuming and complicated, thereby delaying any potential impact operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, Zhora identified several resource challenges to Russian operations that he argued have limited their effectiveness. He argued that the emigration of Russian tech professionals has seen a ‘brain drain’ of vital skills from Russia, which has constrained its ability to deploy sophisticated hacking capabilities against Ukraine as the war has unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhora also asserted that Western sanctions have played a part in limiting Russia’s cyber effectiveness. Many states, led by the EU and the US, have imposed increased sanctions against Russia since February 2022, including in the area of technology. Zhora argues these sanctions have made it challenging for Russia to expand sovereign cloud systems. Instead, Russia has to rely on servers abroad, an unattractive choice given that many Western tech companies have stopped selling cloud services in Russia, and that the Kremlin also fears that data stored on foreign cloud services is more easily monitored by foreign intelligence agencies. Zhora believes that, among other things, this has hampered Russia’s ability to launch cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Private sector support is a vital part of Ukraine’s cyber defence, and cooperation with international partners has been key to Ukrainian success&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Zhora acknowledged the fundamental point that in a brutal kinetic conflict like Russia’s war against Ukraine, destructive cyber operations are simply much less relevant. Russia is using traditional kinetic weapons to achieve desired effects on critical infrastructure, rather than attempting to undertake complex cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-weaknesses-meet-ukrainian-strengths&quot;&gt;Russian Weaknesses Meet Ukrainian Strengths&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside Russia’s issues, Zhora highlighted the strength of Ukrainian cyber defence as a decisive factor limiting Russian successes in cyberspace. As Russian weaknesses and Ukrainian strengths are two sides of the same coin, it makes sense to take a closer look at what makes Ukraine’s cyber defence successful. He highlighted two factors: continued private sector support, and the support of overseas governments and volunteers who have joined Ukrainian efforts in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-sector-support-for-ukrainian-cyber-defence&quot;&gt;Private Sector Support for Ukrainian Cyber Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian cyber defence has been bolstered by the rapid delivery of cyber capacities and capabilities by the private sector. This has, broadly, materialised in two ways. First, companies have provided direct support to the Ukrainian government ecosystem. In this case, big tech companies such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon have been forward-leaning across diverse areas including the provision of licenses, threat hunting and cloud migration. Second, companies have been contracted by foreign governments to provide support. The UK Ukraine Cyber Programme, for example, has engaged partnerships with industry to provide incident response to support Ukrainian government entities against malicious attacks and tools to limit attacker access to vital networks. Private sector support is a vital part of Ukraine’s cyber defence, and cooperation with international partners has been key to Ukrainian success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;volunteers-supporting-ukrainian-cyber-defence-efforts&quot;&gt;Volunteers Supporting Ukrainian Cyber Defence Efforts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout his talk, Zhora repeatedly stressed the importance of efforts by ‘volunteers’ to Ukrainian successes – including in cyberspace. Zhora explicitly mentioned private sector-led schemes which allow volunteers to identify vulnerabilities in Ukrainian networks; however, the label also encompasses Ukrainian patriotic hackers who launch offensive cyber operations, including against Russian civilian infrastructure. The level of involvement by the Ukrainian government with these networks is problematically unclear, given that the extent of government control has consequences under international law. While Ukrainian officials frequently claim there is no coordination, there has at the very least been encouragement from the authorities. For example, Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov urged ‘digital talents’ to join the ‘Ukrainian IT army’ – essentially a loosely organised movement made up of members of a Telegram chat who not only identify and patch Ukrainian vulnerabilities, but also target Russian and Belarusian infrastructure. The Ukrainian IT army has raised questions concerning international law, including fears that the civilianisation of cyber operations is ‘a risky trend’. Throughout the conversation, Zhora was careful not to refer directly to the ‘Ukrainian IT army’, but instead spoke exclusively of the supporting role of volunteers and Ukrainian plans to incorporate a cyber reserve into military structures, a proposal that is reportedly inspired by the Estonian Cyber Defense Unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While there have been no overwhelmingly destructive cyber attacks in Ukraine so far, the cyber front is far from ‘quiet’&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyber-warfare-in-ukraine-setting-precedents&quot;&gt;Cyber Warfare in Ukraine Setting Precedents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of a strategically significant destructive cyber campaign targeting Ukraine does not mean that the role of cyber operations in interstate relations should be underestimated. On the contrary, countries will continue to monitor the effectiveness of cyber operations in Ukraine, as it represents a pivotal case study. Both China and Taiwan will doubtless be looking for lessons to improve their respective capabilities. More broadly, other countries need to ask themselves what they can do to strengthen their cyber defences. Zhora spoke about a number of measures taken to improve Ukrainian cyber defences, repeating often heard but nonetheless vital calls for greater cyber security awareness, education and training. However, implementing procedures and protocols requires a trained cyber workforce – a global problem which is not unique to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-reason-to-relax-on-cyber-defence--support-for-ukraine-remains-needed&quot;&gt;No Reason to Relax on Cyber Defence – Support for Ukraine Remains Needed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked whether he expects destructive Russian cyber attacks will continue to have minimal impact, Zhora stressed that this depends largely on Ukrainian defence capabilities. He warned that Russia persists in seeking greater effect through its cyber operations, pointing to ongoing efforts to identify vulnerabilities in Ukrainian systems. For Ukraine’s allies, this means that support for the country’s cyber defence must be maintained. Continued support from international partners – notably those within the NATO alliance like the US and UK – and support from the private sector remain pivotal. Zhora explained, for example, that Ukrainian budgets for cyber defence have decreased given the need to purchase kinetic weapons. Without the necessary resources – whether it is money, people or technology – Ukraine’s cyber defence risks faltering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there have been no overwhelmingly destructive cyber attacks in Ukraine so far, the cyber front is far from ‘quiet’. Cyber remains a key domain across which Russia seeks operational effects to impact and disrupt Ukraine, as well as to influence and undermine its position. As such, continued efforts towards cyber defence must remain crucial for Ukraine, its supporters and its allies – be they in the public or private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

More recently, Riyadh has engaged in new diplomatic moves towards Canada, a country with which it has had a rocky relationship. All of these moves follow a particular pattern, and we are likely to see more of the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonathan Eyal (&lt;strong&gt;JE&lt;/strong&gt;) asked our Senior Associate Fellow, H A Hellyer (&lt;strong&gt;HH&lt;/strong&gt;), about the significance of these events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you think Saudi Arabia was looking to accomplish in this latest flurry of diplomatic engagement at the Arab League? Is it an isolated move?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HH:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Riyadh was the host for this particular Arab League summit, so it’s natural enough that the meeting might take something of a Saudi flavour to it. But Riyadh went beyond that, and that’s down to the current Saudi leadership’s overall foreign policy agenda matching its domestic policy agenda. Foreign observers will be looking at the impacts on relations with the West, Israel and so on – but really, Riyadh’s focus is on the domestic arena, and its geopolitical relationships – alongside its formulation of its own regional position – are critically linked to that focus. So, no, it’s not an isolated move, and it’s very much about the leadership’s overall vision for the Kingdom. For lack of a better expression, one might call it the “turning the page” approach, which is closely connected to Riyadh’s “Vision 2030”, a phrase that came out of Saudi Arabia’s comments at the Arab League.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; So, there is a macro-level strategy at work here, this “turning the page” approach – can you lay out what this means more generally?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HH:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Riyadh has been on a geopolitical offensive, after dealing with the fallout from its (admittedly rather brief) pariah status in the West which followed particularly from the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, as well as to some extent the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The leadership has been keen to build bridges with Western capitals, especially Washington, and has clearly banked on the idea that if it waits it out, Western leaders and elites will eventually move past their antipathy towards the Kingdom. There’s been a lot of attention towards all of this, and it perhaps reminds us that in international relations, there are no permanent allies or permanent enemies, but permanent interests, as Lord Palmerstone famously said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This geopolitical offensive is most interesting in terms of regional dynamics, though. The Khashoggi affair led to strained relations with Turkey, where the murder took place; but the Saudi leadership took up the opportunity to mend ties with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan once an overture was made, presumably due to Turkey’s economic woes. The Saudis had led efforts to isolate Qatar in 2017, but they were also the ones who ended the GCC-wide spat, despite objections within their own camp. The Saudis have expressed incredible antagonism vis-à-vis Iran and its regime, but despite no change in Tehran’s behaviour, Riyadh has recently de-escalated with the Iranians too. More moves have taken place with regards to Yemen as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this means that the Saudis have been perfect in how they’ve engaged regionally, or that they’ve suddenly done a 360 in terms of their view of the world. Rather, it means they’ve decided that it is in the Kingdom’s interest to have fewer conflicts to deal with externally, and I think that’s because they want to focus their energies internally as much as possible. The Arab League meeting was more evidence of this strategy playing out. And then there was the normalisation of diplomatic relations with Canada, following the fallout in 2018 over Canadian diplomatic representations in favour of women’s rights activists in Saudi Arabia; an agreement to return ambassadors was reached in late May. “Turning the page” indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; What did Riyadh seek to accomplish with regards to the West and Ukraine at the Arab League?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HH:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It’s interesting. Saudi Arabia is no doubt aware that there is antipathy vis-à-vis Ukraine in much of the Global South, while at the same time there is full support for Kyiv against the Russian invasion in the West. Riyadh didn’t invite the Ukrainian president as part of a joint decision by various Arab League member states – it took the decision pretty much unilaterally, which seemed to ruffle a few feathers due to some Arab states’ alignments with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Holding off from normalisation with Israel makes Riyadh stronger in the regional and international context, because it means there is still a bargain to be struck&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Riyadh gained substantial and significant credit with Western capitals by doing so. Zelensky is iconic now; he is the only Western leader involved in a direct military conflict with a competitor of the West (Russia) on the global stage. Moreover, he is involved in that conflict as the result of a defensive action – Ukraine didn’t invade Russia, Russia invaded Ukraine – and that makes him a resistance leader of great stature across the West. It was Riyadh that brought Zelensky into direct conversation with senior representatives from across the Arab world, to make his case and state his purpose. No one else has done that in the region, and as such the Saudi move is going to play quite well in Western capitals – not least in Washington and anywhere where solidarity with Ukraine is perceived as a crucial and critical Western interest. It doesn’t hit the reset button on Saudi-Western relations, but it certainly helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; But the West is also concerned about other issues with regards to Saudi Arabia, particularly the Abraham Accords – how has this played out?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HH:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; There has been a push in parts of the DC “Beltway” to get Riyadh to accede to the Abraham Accords, despite Saudi Arabia’s repeated refusal to do so. Maybe one day Riyadh will sign up, but the current mood in the Kingdom is not remotely sympathetic to such a step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, from the Israeli perspective, normalisation with Riyadh would be an achievement of epic proportions, and Netanyahu is clearly trying to find any way to make it happen. This is perhaps because he hopes that massive economic investment will follow, which would serve as a “great diversion” from Israel’s domestic political woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s just one small issue with this strategy: there is little upside to acceding to the Abraham Accords that Riyadh cannot already attain. Normalisation would not strengthen Riyadh’s regional position. On the contrary: holding off from official normalisation makes Riyadh stronger in the regional and international context, because it means there is still a bargain to be struck – thus giving the Kingdom a modicum of leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DC correctly understands that while the region is not made up of democratic regimes, public opinion does have an impact (even if it’s not remotely as critical as in electoral systems). Normalising with the most right-wing government in Israeli history is hardly attractive to Riyadh. The most stalwart of the Abraham Accords signatories is the UAE, and a prominent Emirati figure recently declared that no more Arab states would normalise ties with the Israelis, as the Israeli government was “putting everyone off” – indeed, she went as far as to say that her own government was “embarrassed in front of the Arab people”. Riyadh is certainly not interested in being put in the same position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Syria’s reintegration may come back to haunt Riyadh. Assad hasn’t changed, and his regime continues to be unstable, even with Russian and Iranian backing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, there may be a time when the calculus changes for Riyadh, but it’s not now – especially not with continued US congressional antipathy towards Riyadh, which makes it unlikely that DC could provide sufficient incentives to Saudi Arabia that would also be able to pass through Congress. It’s a bit peculiar that the idea of normalisation keeps being raised, especially when a US official said this month – albeit off the record – that recent statements by Saudi officials should “put to rest talk of a major US push for Saudi-Israeli normalisation”, and that the talks were “a campaign full of hot air blown by well-meaning folks mostly in Israel”. Ideological aspirations aside, I think the trend is pretty clear, hence Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s repeating of demands for an end to the Israeli occupation and for the general parameters of the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 – which was itself a Saudi enterprise – to be adhered to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; The event that was all too evident in advance was Bashar al-Assad’s appearance. Saudi Arabia backed his exclusion from the League for years, but recently that’s changed. What are you seeing there?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HH:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; On Syria, Riyadh didn’t begin the push for normalisation with Assad’s regime. But it did run with it, and hard. This is all part of Riyadh’s calculation that its domestic agenda requires de-escalation in its regional policy, so that its full attention is focused within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Assad’s reintegration may come back to haunt Riyadh. Assad hasn’t changed, and his regime continues to be unstable, even with Russian and Iranian backing. There are millions of Syrians who view Assad as the most brutal leader in their history, and that isn’t a recipe for good times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assad’s Syria is often described as a new “narco-state” in the Middle East, and that is also a source of societal instability for regional states. Yes, the Arab League suggested “conditions” for reintegration, but this conditionality isn’t going to be taken seriously at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Riyadh that pushed the normalisation through, going over the heads of a number of states that were not ready for this step. Even its former adversary in the GCC (Qatar) has fully accepted Riyadh’s pole position in the region, and is keen not to take steps that would cause tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE:&lt;/strong&gt; How does this all bode for the future?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HH:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Turkish AK Party promulgated its “Zero-Problems” approach to regional dynamics some two decades ago, including in its electoral platform a promise to “improve relations with Turkey’s neighbours”. Of course, Ankara faced a lot of problems in trying to uphold this pledge, and in recent years it has engaged in far more confrontational moves. To draw another parallel, the “ethical foreign policy” approach of the early years of the Tony Blair government in the UK gave way to the Iraq War in 2003; political events often take on lives of their own which go far beyond expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that being said, I suspect we will see further moves towards de-escalation from Riyadh. In Sudan, where the Sudanese army is engaged in a power struggle against an assorted group of militias, Riyadh is trying to de-escalate the situation; in Lebanon, I think we’ll also see moves by Saudi Arabia to reduce tensions. It’s less about Riyadh trying to cast itself in a new role of regional mediator, in my opinion, and more a reflection of the fact that as Riyadh focuses more of its energy internally, it wants fewer distractions or spoilers externally.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官要求控方交代各被告及共謀者加入串謀日期 辯方指被告未料《國安法》前言行違法造成不公&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3Top6Ca.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（31日）踏入審訊第60天，續處理「共謀者原則」的法律爭議。法官陳慶偉今表示，被告何時加入串謀屬重要，惟控方沒有說明，要求控方明天提交各被告及共謀者加入串謀日期的列表。控方在法官追問下，指若法庭不同意本案於2020年1月飯局已形成串謀，下個形成串謀的日期為3月25日公民黨記者會，惟法官質疑該記者會與戴耀廷和區諾軒無關，亦指似乎無證據前民主動力總幹事黎敬輝為共謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對控方指被告或涉「公職人員行為失當罪」，辯方質疑不能與「顛覆國家政權罪」類比，而被告《國安法》生效前未必能預料當時言行或違法，控方以此指證被告構成不公；又指控方引用的美國案例與共謀者原則無關，對本案無約束力。法官多番追問，該案例有否提及控罪生效前已形成串謀協議，並指若然如此便需慎交朋友，否則朋友日後犯事，即使以往交往多清白，也可能成為犯罪言行。控方最終承認案例沒有如此提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官數度追問串謀形成日期-控方一度稱325公民黨記者會-官質疑與戴耀廷無關&quot;&gt;官數度追問串謀形成日期 控方一度稱3.25公民黨記者會 官質疑與戴耀廷無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方前日（29日）就能否於本案援引「共謀者原則」陳詞，案件押至今續。法官陳慶偉甫開庭先澄清辯方立場，以戴耀廷文章為例，指據現時的同意事實和證據，似乎除了代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 外，相關證據的呈堂性並沒有被挑戰，可納為環境證供，辯方只是爭議控方使用證據的目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，因此據控陳詞，似乎被告何時加入串謀屬重要，但控方並沒有明確說明，並指控方說法是串謀於2020年1月已由戴耀廷和區諾軒形成，問若法庭不同意這個日子，控方指串謀開始的下一個日期是何時？主控周天行指是3月25日，因公民黨當天舉行記者會。惟法官李運騰和陳慶偉即指，該記者會與戴耀廷和區諾軒無關。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 副刑事檢控專員(III) 周天行&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，若法庭不同意3月25日的日子，下一個日期會是何時？周天行指是6月8日，因當天趙家賢要求戴耀廷發送最終協議文件。陳再問，若不同意6月8日呢？周天行指是被告提交提名表格的日子，陳即反問為何不是6月9日的初選記者會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官要求表列被告及共謀者加入串謀時間指看來無證據黎敬輝是共謀者&quot;&gt;官要求表列被告及共謀者加入串謀時間、指看來無證據黎敬輝是共謀者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行未回答，李運騰便指若控方是指串謀首先由組織者如戴耀廷、區諾軒和趙家賢等形成，可理解控方指串謀是由6月8日開始；但其他被告或於不同時間加入串謀。他並指，控方就被告加入串謀之前和之後的證據在「共謀者原則」下的使用有所區分，控方指被告加入前其他共謀者的言行可顯示串謀的性質和範圍，而被告加入後，相關言行便可顯示其參與，因此控方須說明每名被告何時加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉補充，不止是被告，還包括控方指同為共謀者的前觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻、前民主動力總幹事黎敬輝，及前公民黨立法會議員郭榮鏗，認為控方要準備顯示每名被告和串謀者加入串謀日期的列表。李運騰並指，特別關注為何控方指黎敬輝是串謀的一分子，以及有何獨立證據證明黎是共謀者之一，笑指現時所有有關黎的資料都是由趙家賢提供，但表面看來沒有證據顯示他是共謀者，因黎只是被要求出席會議和抄筆記，「他不是在那裡發表任何個人意見。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 6月9日初選記者會&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方一度稱未能列加入確實時間-後同意明日交列表&quot;&gt;控方一度稱未能列加入確實時間 後同意明日交列表&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續要求控方在列表列出各人被指加入串謀的日期，以及其他後備的日期，又以楊雪盈為例，指加入串謀日期可能是港島區首次會議、6月8日分發協議最終版本、6月9日初選記者會、6月13日提名期開始、6月20日提名期結束、楊實際交表日期、6月30日《國安法》實施、7月1日、或7月11日和12日的初選投票日，望控方能說明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰補充，法庭現時並非要就被告加入串謀的日期作裁斷，只是關注控方就「共謀者原則」證據的使用。周天行回應會嘗試，但指未必能列出被告加入的確實時間，問能否列明他們「最遲」加入的時間。陳指控方可另闢一欄處理，但亦要說明何時加入，直言「如果我們容許你提及最遲加入的時間，我肯定你只會說是2020年6月30日」。控方確認明天可提供此列表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑公職人員失當與顛覆國家政權不同-不能作類比&quot;&gt;辯方質疑公職人員失當與顛覆國家政權不同 不能作類比&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸其後陳詞。就控方稱各被告於《國安法》生效前涉違串謀公職人員行為失當，因此相關言行均可納為「共謀者原則」下的證據，黃宇逸指「公職人員行為失當罪」的控罪元素包括「故意」作出不當行為，但戴耀廷在《國安法》前稱認為初選是合法，因此並非「故意」違法。惟法官質疑，無證據顯示其他被告當時也相信戴耀廷說法，且不同被告對否決預算案的取態不一，辯方不能一概而論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官表示，理解辯方指「公職人員行為失當罪」與「顛覆國家政權罪」是不同的罪行、控罪元素不一，因此控方在運用證據時，不能以「公職人員行為失當罪」類比「顛覆國家政權罪」；而若辯方得悉控方指控被告公職人員行為失當，辯方抗辯和盤問會非常不同，黃宇逸同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑被告未能預料國安法前言行變違法-引共謀者原則屬不公&quot;&gt;辯方質疑被告未能預料《國安法》前言行變違法 引「共謀者原則」屬不公&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃宇逸續解釋，一般而言任何傳聞證供（hearsay）均不能呈堂，惟在「共謀者原則」下例外；而引用「共謀者原則」的前提是被告同意追求一個「非法」目的，故所有促進該目的之言行均可用以指證所有共謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/V9Pgtwf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師 黃宇逸&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟黃認為，控方現時採納尚未變成「非法」的言行，是擴闊共謀者原則的用途，違背該原則的精神；又指被告《國安法》生效前未必能預料其言行或共同目的可能違法，控方以此指證被告，是剝奪他們基於刑事責任而選擇退出計劃的機會，有違首要的「公平性」原則。至於《國安法》後言行，黃認為只要符合相關前提，控方亦能接納為「共謀者原則」下的證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方提出的1950年美國案例 United States v. Dennis，黃指控方只是找到一份案例支持其說法，但該案例與共謀者原則無關，也沒說明應用共謀者原則的條件，對本案沒有約束力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方批無獨立證據證被告參與串謀&quot;&gt;辯方批無獨立證據證被告參與串謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 則表示，控方要援引「共謀者原則」，須有獨立證據證明何桂藍參與該串謀，惟現時無相關證據。李運騰指「墨落無悔」聲明書可佐證，惟 Beel 指控方已援引此為「共謀者原則」下的證據，故不屬「獨立證據」，但控方亦沒有其他證據，包括提名表格亦沒有明確顯示被告同意的「共識」是什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於控方指援引「共謀者原則」是為證明共謀者言行的「真實性（truth）」，代表李予信的大律師關文渭則指，控方並非意圖證明真實性，例如並非要指戴耀廷批評政府的說話為真。法官回應，控方目的是要藉相關文章顯示串謀的起源、性質和範圍，關文渭指即使沒有「共謀者原則」，相關證據也可呈堂，而控方真正目的是要指當一個人說某些話，是代表（acting as agent）所有其他被告說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官重申美國案例無就共謀者原則作決定-惟控方堅稱有關&quot;&gt;官重申美國案例無就「共謀者原則」作決定 惟控方堅稱有關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪其後表示就辯方陳詞作簡短回應。就辯方對控方引1950年美國案例 United States v. Dennis 之質疑，該案涉有共產黨領袖於1945至1948年串謀暴力推翻美國政府，違反1940年通過的《史密斯法案》（The Smith Act）被定罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬重申該案例與共謀者原則有關，提及共謀者在控罪生效前的言行不能納為證據是不合理，又指本案的背景非常不同。陳慶偉表示那是常識（common sense），萬回應他會說更多關於常識的東西，惟陳即搖頭指不要說，並謂：「如果你只是想作簡短回應，便做一個簡短回應，然後你就可以坐下，我不是來聽學術辯論的，謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉並指，該案唯一受爭議的證據，是有關被告以外的共產黨教師，於《史密斯法案》（The Smith Act）在1940年通過前到訪莫斯科接受馬克斯主義的訓練，但那只是用以說明串謀起源的環境證供，不需用到共謀者原則，該案例亦沒有就該原則作出任何決定。惟萬德豪堅稱是有關共謀者原則的應用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官追問案例有否稱串謀於法例生效前形成-稱若然如此需小心交友&quot;&gt;官追問案例有否稱串謀於法例生效前形成 稱若然如此需小心交友&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問及，該案例有否裁定1940年前，該批教師已形成串謀協議推翻美國政府，並指「如果有，告訴我們第幾段」。萬德豪未有正面回應，僅稱判詞指該些教師與被告屬同一政黨，惟陳慶偉指那與串謀推翻政府是兩回事。李運騰亦指他們可能因有共同興趣而一同研習，但若案例指他們當時已形成協議，便要很小心選擇朋友，因若該些朋友日後成了罪犯，「即使以往的交往多清白，也可能會變成犯罪的言行。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪未有正面回答，李運騰再多次追問，又向萬指「我想你也很努力嘗試，我們欣賞你的努力，你還有沒有什麼想說？」，惟萬均沒有正面回應。陳慶偉指不認為案例有指明已形成協議，又着萬明天告訴法庭。李運騰最後再指，他的問題很簡單，只需答「是」或「否」，不是要猜謎，萬最後承認案例沒有如此提及。案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

But what do Chinese experts have to say about the matter? And how might they be advising their government?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of Beijing’s relationship with Moscow remain as opaque as the inner workings of the Chinese Communist Party. As a result, we rely on body-language experts to dissect every aspect of a handshake between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin to help confirm what we think we already know. Are China–Russia ties so plagued by mutual distrust that they are set for an inevitable weakening or even collapse? Or are they now so strong that they might develop into a formal alliance or lead China into providing military support to Moscow? Arguments continue to be made in both directions, some more convincing than others. Ultimately, however, we are mostly just reading the tea leaves, and this article will likewise attempt to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-as-chinas-main-driver&quot;&gt;Security as China’s Main Driver&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since having frank and open conversations with Chinese government officials is almost impossible, following academic debates has become one of the few ways of gleaning hints about how Chinese leaders may be reflecting upon certain issues and the type of advice that they may be receiving. Zhao Huasheng (赵华胜), one of China’s most renowned Russia experts, may provide a few clues. In one of the more comprehensive analyses of China–Russia relations to have been published in China since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Zhao explains why he believes that his country should maintain its close ties with Moscow in spite of the drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, he describes security as being Beijing’s foremost interest in its bilateral relationship with the Kremlin. “With China’s greatest strategic pressure coming from the sea”, he says, “good Sino-Russian relations can ensure that China has … a relatively stable strategic rear … This has enormous strategic benefits for China. The significance of this is invisible and seemingly unremarkable in times of peace, but its strategic relevance to China will be revealed were our country to be faced with a major upheaval [变故] coming from abroad.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes beyond simply stabilising China’s 4,300-km-long border with Russia. On account of Moscow’s remaining influence in and around China’s neighbourhood, “good Sino-Russian relations can at the very least ensure the basic stability of half of Eurasia”, Zhao argues. Conversely, “a deterioration in Sino-Russian relations would plunge the entire Eurasian continent into a state of turmoil and uncertainty”. This would be highly detrimental to China’s “security and economic interests”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its hinterland stabilised, Beijing is able to focus most of its energy and military resources on its coast, the surrounding seas and – most importantly – Taiwan. The island, according to Zhao, “is the greatest strategic challenge facing China. In a sense, it is like the sword of Damocles hanging over [our] head. We do not know when it will fall, perhaps suddenly, perhaps in the more distant future. But in any case, China cannot [afford] not to prepare itself for all the possible changes [that might affect] the situation in the Taiwan Strait. If the mainland were one day obliged to reunify using military means, we can be sure that China would then find itself in an extremely difficult and complex international environment”. And although Zhao does not expect Russia to be “completely” supportive of China (不期望俄罗斯完全支持中国) in the event of such a crisis – perhaps much like China’s stance over Ukraine – he does expect Moscow to maintain its ties with Beijing and to not take part in imposing sanctions on his country. Zhao reminds his readers that, “Among the major powers, Russia is probably the only one that is not opposed to China”. Were US-China relations ever to descend into outright confrontation (对峙), Moscow could well seek to play both sides. “But so long as it does not side with the US, this will be a strategic success for China”, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Perhaps more damaging to China than the war in Ukraine itself has been Beijing’s refusal to distance itself from the aggressor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economically, Russia may only represent a small share (roughly 3%) of China’s foreign trade, Zhao says, but “in the event of a major international crisis, Russia would be the most important foreign source of energy – and [perhaps] even the only foreign source of oil – that China could conceivably continue to preserve”. Other scholars in China also highlight Russia’s important role in helping to achieve some of Beijing’s broader economic and financial objectives, such as the internationalisation of the yuan and the continued quest for a credible alternative to Western cross-border payment systems, with the aim of reducing China’s and the world’s dependence on the current US-dominated financial system. More broadly, Moscow is regularly portrayed as a key partner, if not Beijing’s most important partner, in what Zhao calls “China’s push to build a new international order” – in other words, an order that would be less dominated by the West and more in line with the interests of Moscow, Beijing and other members of the Global South. Losing the support of a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a key participant in such groupings as the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation would inevitably jeopardise such plans. Summarising the China–Russia relationship, Wang Xiaoquan (王晓泉), a Russia specialist from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, remarks: “China and Russia are ‘half of the sky’ [半边天] for each other’s security and development”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-positive-and-negative-impact-of-the-war-in-ukraine-on-china&quot;&gt;The Positive and Negative Impact of the War in Ukraine on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine came as a shock to most experts in China. Chinese academia has its fair share of Russia apologists who blame the war on both Washington and NATO’s eastward expansion. However, even they occasionally bemoan the adverse consequences that the war has had for China. To be sure, some see the conflict as having helped to push Russia further into China’s orbit and to accelerate the emergence of the desired new multipolar and less Western-centric world order, and even as having distracted – albeit temporarily – the US from its “containment” of China in the Indo-Pacific. Yet, in these scholarly discussions at least, the negatives seem to outweigh the positives. As Chinese economist Xu Mingqi (徐明棋) noted last year: “The repercussions of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine have been largely negative [for us] and I cannot see China benefitting from it … First, it has hindered the world economy’s [post-pandemic] recovery; second, it has fuelled the ideological trend towards deglobalisation; and third, it has put global economic governance in jeopardy.” Stability abroad continues to be key to sustaining China’s economic development, Xu adds. In that respect at least, the war in Ukraine has evidently run counter to his country’s interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more damaging to China than the war itself has been Beijing’s refusal to distance itself from the aggressor. A few months after the invasion, Yan Xuetong (阎学通), one of China’s leading international relations experts, acknowledged that “refusing to condemn Russia has strained China’s relations with some of its neighbours and distanced Beijing from many developing nations”. Like many others in China, Zhou Bo (周波), a well-known former senior People’s Liberation Army colonel turned think-tanker, regrets the negative impact that the war has had on China’s relations with Europe in particular. In his words: “The last thing China wants is a deterioration in its relations with European countries. It is very important to us that Europe is not always on the side of the United States.” Yang Jiemian (杨洁勉), another notable figure in China’s think-tank world (and brother of former top diplomat and politburo member Yang Jiechi), worries about the deep rift and growing hostility that has emerged between Russia and China on the one side and the West and its allies on the other (he blames this on Washington, of course). Like many of his peers, he is particularly concerned about the impact that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is having on cross-Strait relations, with the West more intent than ever on providing diplomatic and military support to Taiwan. Instability, decoupling, confrontation and containment are written all over these assessments, and Ukraine is depicted as a major catalyst of this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-imperialistic-messianic-and-reckless-partner&quot;&gt;An Imperialistic, Messianic and Reckless Partner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although censorship, self-censorship and China’s propaganda machine ensure that China–Russia relations are mostly portrayed as flourishing, disapproval of Russia’s actions does occasionally transpire even among China’s staunchest Russia sympathisers. Wang Wen (王文), for instance, who is the director of Renmin University’s Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies and a former Global Times journalist, recently asked Russian intellectual Aleksandr Dugin (who is also nicknamed “Putin’s brain” in China) “why Russia’s elite do not advise President Putin to do his best to avoid conflicts or to adopt approaches that might be better than [his] special military operations”. Also present in the writings and speeches of Chinese scholars are the occasional jabs at both Putin and Russia for their alleged imperialistic tendencies, messianic ideology and reckless behaviour. Feng Yujun (冯玉军), one of China’s most outspoken critics of Moscow since the beginning of the war and the director of Fudan University’s Centre for Russian and Central Asian Studies, stresses that “the imperial logic underlying both the rejection of Ukraine as a national entity and the overt claim to restore [Russia’s] traditional territories is alarming”. He describes Russian culture as suffering from a superiority complex and Putin’s conservatism as an empty “discursive bubble”, a mere tool for Moscow to advance its political interests and bolster its legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical grievances against Russia run deep in China and regularly resurface even among ordinary citizens. As Yuan Gang (袁刚), then a professor at Peking University, once noted: “In recent times, China has had its share of invasions and abuse at the hands of the Great Powers, yet Russia’s seizure of Chinese territories was the greatest scourge of all.” Memories of betrayals, bullying and even aggression by China’s former Soviet brother are surely still very much alive, particularly among President Xi’s generation, which lived through some of the tensest moments of China–USSR relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chinese scholars do not hesitate to point out that Russia’s vision of a new world order differs greatly from China’s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese Ambassador to France Lu Shaye’s (卢沙野) recent comments, which appeared to question the legal status of former Soviet states, should not distract from the palpable unease among Chinese intellectuals over Russia’s approach to national sovereignty – a concept that continues to be paramount for China. Shortly after Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Yuan asked ironically: “Could China’s Tannu Uriankhai consisting of 170,000 square kilometres of territory, which was seized by the Soviet Union under Lenin and [later] replaced by the so-called “Tuvan Autonomous Republic”, be returned to China by a vote of the local inhabitants, who have long been inclined towards separatism, with the promise of a tripling of their pay by China? Even worse, if a majority of the Taiwanese were to vote in favour of independence, would China resign itself to this fate?” He continued: “The Russians have also openly introduced the concept of ‘strategic space’, going so far as to treat the territories of other countries as their own ‘space’ and claiming that they cannot stand the West ‘encroaching’ on their ‘strategic space’. What is the difference between this and Hitler’s cry for ‘Lebensraum’?” Yuan is admittedly on the extreme end of the spectrum when it comes to criticising Russia (and his own government), but milder versions of his views continue to exist in China. Whether President Xi and his colleagues are closer to Ambassador Lu’s perception of former Soviet states or to Yuan’s is difficult to tell. But their official rebuttal of Lu’s controversial comments and their refusal to recognise Russia’s annexations in eastern Ukraine (including Crimea) show at the very least that Russian behaviour poses a challenge to one of China’s most fundamental principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the vaunted camaraderie between Xi and Putin and the former’s recent parting words to his “dear friend” that the world is undergoing its biggest change in a century and that “we are driving this change together”, Chinese scholars do not hesitate to point out that Russia’s vision of a new world order differs greatly from China’s. Zhao Long (赵隆), a researcher at one of China’s top think tanks (SIIS), notes that “while China emphasises the careful reform and improvement of the [current] order, Russia hopes for its complete disintegration”. Huang Jing (黄靖), a well-known “returnee scholar” from the US, says much the same, adding that Moscow’s desire to confront and weaken the West does not align with China’s developmental interests. Feng adds that if Putin does indeed seek to overturn the current order, then he should at least have a credible alternative to offer, but he does not. While most Chinese scholars may not go as far as Feng in his criticism of Russian mentality, politics and society in general, many point to the increasingly visible weaknesses in Russia’s economy, military and technological advancement. Tang Shiping (唐世平), another prominent international relations scholar from Fudan University, describes how Russia’s overall strength and influence have been severely damaged by the war and concludes (in English) that, “Although Russia remains an important strategic partner of China, the China-Russia strategic partnership surely faces growing challenges”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overt calls by Chinese scholars for Beijing to distance itself from Moscow are rare for obvious reasons. Somewhat more common are implicit and explicit criticisms of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, though Chinese censors have prevented at least some of these voices from being heard. While – as Feng points out – mentions of China’s “no limits” partnership with Russia have indeed faded from Chinese official pronouncements, relations with Moscow are still going strong 15 months into the war, and China–Russia joint military exercises continue apace. Challenges to the relationship there may be, but few predict a sudden and significant repositioning of Beijing’s approach to Russia, barring a major upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinarussia-relations-through-the-lens-of-a-chinese-realist&quot;&gt;China–Russia Relations Through the Lens of a Chinese Realist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Beijing’s recent posture towards both Russia and Ukraine, Zhao’s analysis of China–Russia relations in the context of this conflict remains one of the most compelling. He acknowledges that his government’s refusal to condemn Moscow for its actions has tarnished China’s image, particularly in the West. But he sees the benefits of maintaining close ties with Moscow as outweighing those that Beijing might gain by condemning (and offending) Russia. Zhao is a self-professed proponent of realpolitik and a critic of values-driven diplomacy. Like many of his peers, he probably does disapprove of Russia’s actions, but does not say so explicitly, simply noting that “maintaining Sino-Russian cooperation does not imply supporting all of Russia’s actions and policies”. He claims to be neither pro-US nor anti-US, and neither pro-Russia nor anti-Russia. Rather, he is guided first and foremost by his country’s national interests. “Russia is not infringing China’s core interests, so why should [we] take the initiative to destroy a friendly relationship?”, he asks. “There is a saying that nothing is more difficult to build up and easier to destroy than trust. The friendship between China and Russia has been extremely difficult to achieve. Destroying it would be much easier. All it would take is a condemnatory statement [by China] and participation in sanctions against Russia and the foundation of friendship and trust that China and Russia have built up over decades would collapse.” Like Zhao, many – if not most – Chinese experts do not believe that joining the West in condemning Russia would have led Washington to soften its approach to China. Siding more closely with the West and Ukraine would, as the Chinese expression goes, have been akin to “giving a bride away on top of losing one’s soldiers” (赔了夫人又折兵).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if one were boldly to assume that China’s leadership is assessing its relationship with the Kremlin through a similar lens to that of Zhao and other like-minded Chinese realists, then Beijing’s neutrality in this conflict would seem all the more difficult to sustain. If moral values must give way to a country’s strategic interests, then China would need Russia to come out on top or – at the very least – not to lose too badly in Ukraine. This is essentially what Tang was suggesting in a piece last year. Yang Jiemian would probably agree: “In the unlikely event that Russia were to be continually weakened to the extent that it would be unable, unwilling or afraid to continue its struggle against the US and the West”, he writes, “this would ultimately lead to an extremely unfavourable strategic situation for China”. Feng Shaolei (冯绍雷), another prominent Russia specialist, worries about what would happen if either a pro-Western regime or an even more radical force than Putin’s were to take over the Kremlin and become China’s neighbour. Feng has thus called on his government to take a more “proactive” stance in trying to resolve this conflict and to use the influence that it has to encourage peace talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Being dragged further into the Ukraine quagmire is the last thing that China wants, and safeguarding its already tense relations with the West remains one of its top priorities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of whether China might ever provide military support to Moscow (it has denied that it will) is a particularly thorny one that would necessitate more careful consideration than a short analysis of Chinese scholarly views. However, to continue using Zhao’s realist lens, it would seem logical for Beijing to want to prevent both an unknown neighbour from suddenly appearing on its doorstep and the Kremlin from being so weakened that it leaves a power vacuum in China’s fragile Central Asian neighbourhood. Needless to say, China brazenly shipping military goods directly to Russia is hard to imagine and would not be in keeping with its peace-promoting, non-aligned and non-interfering posture. But there are, of course, other ways of keeping a friend afloat. What is also abundantly clear from these discussions is that being dragged further into this quagmire is the last thing that China wants, and safeguarding its already tense relations with the West remains one of its top priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, a UK civil servant specialising in China–Russia relations wrote a piece under a pseudonym in which he/she warned that China–Russia ties were likely to strengthen and that they might even develop “into some form of formal alliance structure as each looks to the other for support against perceived Western encirclement”. The argument that what the Chinese would call “contradictions” with the West – and more specifically with the US – are the main binding force and driver of China–Russia relations is certainly a very strong (and widely held) one. But in the light of what Chinese experts have been advocating, the author’s suggestion that Beijing’s partnership with Moscow might develop into a formal alliance appears somewhat less convincing. The author apparently bases part of his/her argument on two Chinese sources recommending this change, the first being Yan Xuetong and the other “a government-commissioned national security ‘blue book’” written by CICIR, a key think tank linked to China’s Ministry of State Security. Unfortunately, no valid link to this report was provided, but since pro-alliance views have previously been expressed in China, one must assume that this was indeed part of its recommendations. That being said, one report published almost 10 years ago is insufficient to substantiate the idea that Chinese experts are currently pushing for this change. In fact, the director of CICIR’s Institute of Eurasian Studies, Ding Xiaoxing (丁晓星), published a paper just last month in which he maintains that “forging a partnership without forming an alliance [结伴不结盟] is more conducive to the long-term development of Sino-Russian relations”. As for Yan, most China watchers will know that he has long been arguing for his country to form alliances with some of its neighbours but, as he has stated himself, his proposal has been rebuffed not only by most of his colleagues, but also by his government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although a more comprehensive overview of both Chinese and Russian opinions on this topic would be welcome, none of the papers reviewed for this article signalled that the tide might be turning in favour of implementing such a change. Quite the contrary. Ding, Zhao and others believe that a formal alliance would create unnecessary risks for a relationship that remains both inherently fragile and scarred by the failures of the previous Sino-Soviet alliance. But were a new alliance ever to be formed, writes Ding, “the possibility of another breakdown in relations between the two countries cannot be ruled out if inequalities in the relationship were to reappear”. Indeed, Chinese scholars are deeply aware of the impact that the dramatic shift in their country’s relative power is having on such a proud country as Russia. Moreover, an alliance would risk exacerbating the bipolarisation of world politics, dragging the Chinese into conflicts that are not theirs to fight and negating Beijing’s vaunted principle of non-alignment. Beijing is better off with a vaguer and more malleable cooperative framework, they say. “Unless Washington increases its strategic pressure on Beijing and Moscow to such an extreme that both states feel compelled to consolidate a formal alliance, China and Russia will continue to pursue a hedging strategy but avoid entering an outright alliance”, concludes Wang Dong (王栋), a professor at Peking University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has been a defining moment in China–Russia relations, and Beijing has shown that it is willing to put up with relatively high costs in order to preserve its ties with the Kremlin. Beijing says that its relationship with Moscow has a “bottom line”, but how far Putin could still go before breaching it is rarely addressed in China. So far, few Chinese scholars have hinted at a significant shift in Beijing’s current policy towards Moscow. The war has certainly presented the China–Russia relationship with “challenges” that are yet to be addressed, but Russia appears to be too strategically important for China to risk losing it right now. A toppling of Putin by a pro-Western force or a crippling of the Kremlin would in all likelihood be a disaster for Beijing. Nevertheless, suspicion of and – for some – even deep-seated antipathy towards this important partner is also evident in these discussions. That is one reason why so many Chinese experts continue to argue against forging a formal alliance with Russia. Distrust (on both sides) points once again to the underlying fragility of China–Russia ties and is perhaps one of the reasons why Beijing has been quite so afraid of offending its partner.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方首稱被告《國安法》生效前涉公職人員行為失當 官質疑不公&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QzrU3f0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（29日）踏入審訊第59天，處理「共謀者原則」的法律爭議，包括該原則是否適用於《國安法》生效前的言行。控方表示，區諾軒和戴耀廷於2020年1月的飯局已達成串謀協議，有無差別否決預算案迫使政府回應五大訴求的不合法「共同目的」，而被告當時同意濫用立法會議員職權，或涉串謀公職人員行為失當，認為共謀者於《國安法》生效前的言行，可用來指證被告干犯本案控罪。惟法官質疑，飯局上並沒有達成任何協議，區諾軒亦稱與戴耀廷目的不同；又指控方已處理本案兩年半，但開審50多天才首稱被告《國安法》生效前或早已違法，質疑對被告造成不公。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦援引一宗1950年的美國上訴法院案例，指控罪生效前的言行可納為「共謀者原則」下的證據，但同意是控方能找到的唯一案例，遭法官質疑案例不適用於本案。辯方陳詞時則批評，控方於法律爭議階段才突提及公職人員行為失當的指控是「不公平至極」，又強調《國安法》生效前討論無差別否決預算案並不構成任何罪行，故共謀者原則不可能適用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方區諾軒戴耀廷2020年1月已有無差別否決財案共同目的&quot;&gt;控方：區諾軒戴耀廷2020年1月已有無差別否決財案「共同目的」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早前傳畢所有證人，案件押至今就「共謀者原則（co-conspirators rule）」等法律爭議陳詞。根據該原則，各共謀者的言行均可用來指證所有被告，而控方早前指並非本案被告的蔡澤鴻、黎敬輝和郭榮鏗均是本案共謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉甫開庭表示，關注《國安法》生效前共謀者的言行可否被納為共謀者原則下的證據，望先聽取這方面的陳詞。主控周天行表示，辯方就共謀者原則提交聯合書面陳詞，惟鄭達鴻、梁國雄和柯耀林沒有參與，另外提交陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行先表明，控方立場並非指《國安法》具追溯力，只是認為共謀者在《國安法》生效前的言行均可用來指證各被告。周續引案例，指援引此原則的重點是在串謀的「共同目的（common purpose）」，而非所控的「罪行」；而控方認為本案串謀協議由區諾軒與戴耀廷於2020年1月底的飯局達成，他們同意無差別否決預算案，以迫使政府回應五大訴求，而此「共同目的」由始至終維持不變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑飯局無達成協議區諾軒稱與戴耀廷目的不一-控方或出錯&quot;&gt;官質疑飯局無達成協議、區諾軒稱與戴耀廷目的不一 控方或出錯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周續指，共謀者於《國安法》生效前的言行均一直促進（in furtherance）和建立（build up）本案的串謀，例如招募潛在的共謀者、提倡和宣傳串謀等，並逐步擴大規模；並指即使《國安法》未生效，各被告的串謀協議亦是違法，可能干犯串謀公職人員行為失當，故當時的言行均可納為「共謀者原則」下的證據，用來指證被告串謀顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，控方在開案陳詞沒有如此說明，這是他第一次聽到此說法。李運騰亦指，在50多天的審訊中控方從無提及此立場。周天行同意，並強調被告的共同目的維持不變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉指「我個人有懷疑」，指在一開始的飯局「沒有同意任何事，甚至沒有同意舉辦公民投票（“Nothing has been agreed, not even the holding of a civil voting.”）」，而區諾軒的證供是「戴耀廷可能有他的目的，但我有不同的目的」。周天行欲解釋，遭陳打斷指明白控方立場，但「我是指出你可能有問題，因為你說早在1月的飯局已達成共同目的，我是說你可能有錯（mistaken）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方引1950年美國案例-指控罪生效前言行可納為證據-同意僅唯一案例&quot;&gt;控方引1950年美國案例 指控罪生效前言行可納為證據 同意僅唯一案例&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方同意，若法庭不接納就共同目的之陳詞，將會依賴一宗美國聯邦第二巡迴上訴法院於1950年的案例United States v. Dennis，以說明控罪生效前的言行，仍可納為共謀者原則下的證據。李運騰問，故在所有的普通法管轄區，控方只是找到一宗案例支持他們的說法，而且該案例還是來自美國的上訴法院？周天行同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據該案例，有共產黨領袖被控於1945至1948年串謀暴力推翻美國政府，違反1940年通過的《史密斯法案》（The Smith Act）。周引案例指，沒有合理原因將串謀的證據限於控罪期間，因若串謀於控罪日期前發生，相關共謀者的言行亦同樣有力；又指其他共謀者促進串謀的言行可被視作被告的言行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉指出，案例亦表明只適用於控罪期間發生的言行；辯方亦反駁根據該案例，共謀者言行只是用來指證作出相關言行的本人，而非其他人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問50年前無罪言論是否可用作指證被告-稱一輩子都要很小心&quot;&gt;官問50年前無罪言論是否可用作指證被告 稱「一輩子都要很小心」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續舉例，若3名主審法官稱要推翻政府，而提出的當刻並不犯法，控方是否認為50年後，可用他50年前的言論指證他們3人？周天行僅重申，控方立場是由於共謀者一直懷有共同目的，故用以建立串謀的言行均可用來推論串謀的範圍性質及被告的參與。陳笑言，「那即是說我們這輩子都要很小心了」，因一旦他將內心想法說出口，說過的話餘生也可用來指證他，林卓廷大笑。控方回應是視乎串謀是否持續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方確認，現時批評政府的言行日後可用作檢控。陳慶偉續指他不明白，指《國安法》生效前並沒有「顛覆國家政權罪」，那又怎麼可能有「串謀」？控方又怎能利用被告的意念和協議來控告之後的行為？陳仲衡指，因此控方要援引公職人員行為失當罪，以證被告於《國安法》生效前的協議已違法，周天行同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑控方開審50多天才首提國安法生效前已違法-對被告不公&quot;&gt;官質疑控方開審50多天才首提《國安法》生效前已違法 對被告不公&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，這是控方首次提出被告的行為在《國安法》生效前已可能違反普通法下的罪行，指他在開審首天已提出對該原則的關注，「為何我們要到了開審50多天，才知道你有這個後備立場（fallback position）？」，質疑對被告構成不公。陳慶偉亦質疑周天行已處理本案兩年半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方澄清，無意控告被告公職人員行為失當，只是為了顯示被告自2020年1月起已懷有違法的共同目的，以爭論共謀者原則適用於本案；又指此前沒機會提出，但法官反問：「何謂沒機會？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指被告言行可推論串謀範圍-控方稱引共謀者原則為證涉案言行真實性&quot;&gt;官指被告言行可推論串謀範圍 控方稱引共謀者原則為證涉案言行真實性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續提出，《國安法》生效前的言行，如戴耀廷的文章，可作為背景或環境證供推論被告的犯案意圖和思想狀態，並不需要依賴共謀者原則才可呈堂；陳慶偉亦指區諾軒作供時已供述串謀的目的。控方同意，但指援引共謀者原則是要證明共謀者言行所指的「真實性（truth）」，顯示被告的參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪續指，該美國案例提及可考慮與被告屬同一黨派的其他共謀者言行。惟李運騰質疑，該案例只是將相關言行視為被告犯案的背景和環境證供，而非用以證明他們陳述的真實性，與本案的共謀者原則無關，亦不適用於本案；又指若控方只是以相關言行推論串謀範圍，他可以接受，但若控方是以此證明其案情，如接納戴耀廷說已將所有文件發給參與者、或戴耀廷向趙家賢確認新東第二次會議曾進行投票的說法為真實，「那情況就非常不同了，不是嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方同意，並承認所援引的案例只是法官向陪審團表達的「附帶意見（obiter）」，承認「這是我們唯一能找到的（“I have to admit that is all we can find.”）」，但重申該案例與共謀者原則有關。陳慶偉其後指，並非指控方不能依賴戴耀廷的說話，只是不能將戴所說視為事情的全部真相並用以指證所有被告，指那涉及另一個問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官屢追問為何無於開案提公職人員行為失當-控方指控罪已提及&quot;&gt;官屢追問為何無於開案提公職人員行為失當 控方指控罪已提及&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就法官對控方從未提及公職人員行為失當罪的質疑，萬德豪回應，控方的確從沒有在開案陳詞提及該控罪，但認為開案陳詞目的只是向法庭講述控方會援引的證據。李運騰指開案陳詞不止是複述證供（recital of evidence），還要讓法庭和辯方得知控方對案件的主張（case theory），直言這是很重要的部分。陳慶偉亦指，控方無可避免應列出公職人員行為失當罪的詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪重申之所以沒有事先說明，是因控方並非控告被告於《國安法》生效前干犯公職人員行為失當，只是望以此說明共謀者原則適用於本案，不希望就此技術問題令法庭混淆；又指知道控方案情完結前有機會向法庭說明。惟陳慶偉搖頭謂：「我對這個論點不滿意，謝謝。（“I am not impressed with this line of argument, thank you.”）」萬德豪強調，並非要以此「突襲（ambush）」任何人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，控方控罪提及被告以非法手段犯案，追問有什麼阻礙控方於案件開初便說明指控被告干犯公職人員行為失當？萬指經再考慮（on second thought）下，或許在起初說明是較合適；並指控罪有關非法手段的第四細項也提及被告「承諾或同意在該選舉中當選後，及／或煽動、促使、引致、誘使他人在該選舉中當選後，故意或蓄意不履行，或故意或蓄意疏於履行其立法會議員職責」，指該指控實質上也與公職人員行為失當罪一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰總結指，控方立場是雖然開案陳詞沒有表明，但某程度上在控罪上已有此暗示；但質疑其說法不一致，因萬德豪兩分鐘前才承認是第一次提及，現在又說控罪一早已提及。陳慶偉亦搖頭重申，控方可在開案陳詞說明，並指已聽夠相關論點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑控方立場或影響辯方盤問主問從無提濫權&quot;&gt;官質疑控方立場或影響辯方盤問、主問從無提「濫權」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續提及下一點是關於「公平」，陳慶偉問：「對控方的公平？」庭內傳出笑聲，萬指是有關審訊的公平，因望回應辯方引案例談及案件的公平性。李運騰問，若控方一早表明欲指控被告干犯公職人員行為失當，會影響辯方盤問控方證人嗎？萬指不認為會，惟李指這不是控方說了算。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，現時辯方盤問主要集中在達致35+的可能、被告是否有權否決預算案、以及被告是否盡責和細心的議員等，但沒問及他們的協議是否會濫用立會議員的職權，即公職人員行為失當罪的基礎；陳慶偉亦指，控方沒有傳召證人葉劉淑儀，但若控方有相關指控，相信辯方如 Trevor Beel 可能會有不一樣的盤問。庭上早前透露，葉劉淑儀的證供與解散立法會程序及議員職責相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪僅回應，本案重點是無差別否決預算案，即被告是否有共同決心以否決預算案作武器，迫使政府回應訴求，又指那是「明顯的濫權（abuse of power）」。李運騰即指，在主問過程，控方從沒提及「濫用」，萬同意，但認為可從證據推論，不認為控方證人需就被告是否濫權給出意見、相關意見亦與案不太相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續笑着翻動手中開案陳詞，並一手拿起，指「這是我所處理過最厚的開案陳詞，但沒有一隻字提及公職人員行為失當」。萬同意，但重申控罪詳情已足以讓辯方知道控方的指控。控方其後表示陳詞完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方批控方突指控公職人員行為失當不公平至極國安法前討論否決財案非刑事&quot;&gt;辯方批控方突指控公職人員行為失當「不公平至極」、《國安法》前討論否決財案非刑事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文其後就辯方的聯合陳詞發言，表示本案唯一的控罪就是《國安法》，而《國安法》生效前的言行是合法，並不構成任何罪行。李運騰指，但控方立場是一直指控被告公職人員行為失當。惟沈士文指那完全與案無關，並指若控方一早表明被告可能干犯此罪，辯方便會循此方向抗辯；惟控方在爭議共謀者原則時，才突然作此指控，「我看不到比這更不公平的事」、批評是「不公平至極」，指控方竟「夠膽」談及公平。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 黃碧雲（左）、李予信（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方指被告的共同目的維持不變，沈士文反駁指「公職人員行為失當罪」和「顛覆國家政權罪」的法律條文完全不同，亦同意法官陳慶偉指，認罪被告的案情摘要也沒有公職人員行為失當的指控。沈並指，控方曾有很多機會說明立場，包括開案陳詞、及呈交共謀者原則的證據列表時，但控方也完全沒提及相關指控。李運騰補充「濫權」一說更是今天口頭陳詞才首次提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續指，共謀者原則適用的前提，還包括相關共謀者言行必須是促進串謀協議（in furtherance of the conspiracy），以及於串謀待實現期間發生（during the pendency of the conspiracy）；惟沈強調，《國安法》生效前，一起討論無差別否決預算案並非「刑事串謀」，故上述條件也不可能成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押至周三（31日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent disclosure of Russian naval activity in the vicinity of key maritime infrastructure in the North Sea including cables, windfarms and pipelines should not necessarily come as a surprise. Russia has spent a considerable amount of effort investing in capabilities that would allow it to pose a threat to European critical infrastructure, and has viewed this as an imperative since the Soviet era. An emphasis on demonstrating the ability to target economically vital assets can be found in Russian thinking on escalation management, which presumes – correctly or otherwise – that the ability to inflict economic harm represents a means of containing local conflicts on Russia’s periphery by deterring external intervention. In a conflict with NATO, damage to infrastructure at sea along with the targeting of infrastructure ashore would be a key part of Russia’s overall war effort, aimed at gradually eroding popular support in the West. This article will examine some of the tools at Russia’s disposal for the prosecution of a campaign against European infrastructure at sea, the organisational structures that manage them, and the ways in which the threats they pose can be mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-seabed-warfare-an-intelligence-function-not-a-naval-one&quot;&gt;Russian Seabed Warfare: An Intelligence Function, not a Naval One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task of maritime special operations is spread across different organisations within the Russian system, including the Russian Navy and the Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI). These organisations field somewhat different capabilities and likely own different aspects of the function of maritime sabotage. Notably, however, although the Russian Navy plays a key operational role, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the GRU – Russia’s foreign military intelligence agency – appear to control activity in organisational terms, both through the GUGI and the Russian Naval Staff’s Intelligence Directorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GUGI represents a particularly interesting and specialised body. Founded within the navy in 1965 and given its present organisational status in 1975, the organisation exists independent of naval command and has the status of a directorate within the Russian MoD. While independent of the navy, it draws personnel from the 29th Separate Submarine division, a formation based at Olenya Guba which exists to operate platforms for the GUGI. The body operates a number of specialised submarines including the Paltus, X-Ray, Kashalot and Losharik (which is currently undergoing repairs). These submarines share the characteristic of being titanium-hulled, enabling them to sustain the pressure of operating at extreme depths. In the case of the Losharik, the submarine also has a unique internal arrangement, with its hull comprised of seven joined spherical chambers which distribute pressure, enabling it to operate at depths of up to 2,500 metres. The submarines have typically been equipped with manipulator arms, and in the case of the X-Ray, a diver lock-out. Though nuclear-powered, these submarines are relatively small, making the sustainment of crews for extended periods difficult – something experienced by the US Navy with analogous vessels such as the NR-1. As such, they need to be supported by motherships on longer voyages. For this role, the Soviets and then the Russians have typically used stretched versions of retired nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) such as the Yankee class and nuclear-powered cruise missile submarines (SSGNs) such as the Oscar class. The GUGI’s two current motherships, the Belgorod and the BS-64 Podmoskovye, are respectively a stretched Oscar-class SSGN and a Delta-class SSBN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the GUGI operates surface vessels that nominally act as research vessels to gather intelligence. These include the Yantar, which received attention for activity around sensitive cables near the UK in 2019. The vessel is equipped with a variety of sensors and appears capable of acting as a host vessel for the Pr18610 – a three-man deep-diving submersible capable of operating at depths of 20,000 feet. In addition, the vessel likely hosts a range of remotely operated and autonomous underwater vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While understandable attention has been paid to the GUGI’s likely role in damaging critical infrastructure in the event of an escalating conflict, it is important not to assume that this is its only function. The organisation is tasked with the emplacement of sensors associated with Russia’s Harmony network, surveillance of foreign assets in Russian waters, and the removal of foreign surveillance assets, including taps on wires. In addition, the Belgorod will apparently host a part of the Russian nuclear arsenal in the form of the Poseidon nuclear torpedo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In a conflict with NATO, damage to infrastructure at sea would be a key part of Russia’s overall war effort, aimed at gradually eroding popular support in the West&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time that naval personnel spend within the GUGI sees them paid considerable salaries without breaking the relationship between rank and pay, by treating their effective salaries as a deployment bonus related to the time they spend at extreme depths. As a result, in 2012, GUGI personnel were earning 600,000 roubles a month (around $20,000 at the time). The reason for this level of compensation is that the organisation is an extremely specialised one. During the Soviet era, in order to qualify, an individual had to be an officer and have served for five years within the submarine service, and would then have to go through a gruelling course based on the training of Soviet cosmonauts. The list of individuals killed in the 2019 fire which broke out on the GUGI deep-diving submarine Losharik – all officers – suggests the force remains a highly specialised one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GUGI does not own the entirety of the task of maritime sabotage, however. A key role is also played by the Intelligence Directorate of the Main Staff of the Russian Navy. Since 1977, the director of Russian Naval Intelligence has also typically been the deputy director of the GRU, and the Intelligence Directorate was made subordinate to the fifth directorate of the GRU, which reflected the subordination of naval intelligence to the latter – a process which accelerated under the tenure of Admiral Vladimir Chernavin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the Russian vessel most recently spotted near European infrastructure – the Akademik Vladimirsky – belongs to the Russian Navy and not to the GUGI. Though the precise suite of sensors on board the ship are unknown, in a 2012 research expedition to the South Pole it deployed a proton magnetometer, which could also be used to discover metallic objects on the seabed such as pipelines. During the Cold War, the Soviet Navy also maintained a number of auxiliary surveillance vessels based on common trawlers, which were tasked with a range of intelligence gathering functions, and regional fleets controlled Spetsnaz units with an explicit sabotage role. Moreover, the Navy was charged with managing relations with Soviet fishing fleets, which could be co-opted into both intelligence gathering and sabotage functions. The recently revealed use of civilian vessels to survey wind farms in the North Sea suggests that this practice has been continued and is likely a task of the Navy rather than the GUGI. The Spetsnaz units controlled by regional fleets can be inserted into theatre using a range of mechanisms such as swimmer delivery vehicles, and can be used for both surveillance and covert operations against military and civilian targets. The Northern Fleet’s Spetsnaz have trained for operations against SOSUS, and those of the Baltic Fleet have allegedly been involved in covert sabotage. Like all Spetsnaz, these units are under the ultimate control of the GRU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bifurcation of responsibilities between naval intelligence, which answers to the GRU, and the GUGI – which apparently sits as a directorate within the Russian MoD – would seem to create an artificial divide between assets performing similar functions. There is nothing entirely unusual about an intelligence agency controlling assets that are especially sensitive; the CIA, for example, directly controlled the U-2 spy plane and directed many of the operations of spy submarines like the NR-1. However, leaving some assets with the Russian Navy (albeit under ultimate control of the GRU) while conferring others on the GUGI is an interesting organisational choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that sensitivity is the primary consideration, although given the likely involvement of the GRU in highly sensitive unconventional operations including both sabotage and assassinations, this seems unlikely to be the case. Another possibility is that because the fifth directorate is responsible for operational intelligence, its responsibilities include more strictly military tasks such as trailing Western naval assets, whereas the GUGI retains control over those assets needed for activities that are more strategic. A final reason why these assets were removed from the navy’s control may have been the reassertion of control by the Russian General Staff over the Soviet Navy under the tenure of Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov and then-Soviet Defence Minister Dmitri Ustinov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Navies will likely need to have the organisational structures to coordinate with a broader range of actors in order to meet the challenge of maritime sabotage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the GUGI appears capable of organising its assets along with naval capabilities on a task-specific basis. For example, one investigation of the Nord Stream blasts alleged that elements of both Unit 45707 and the 313th Special-Purpose Detachment for Combating Underwater Sabotage of the Baltic Fleet were involved. As such, it would appear that the GUGI can draw on assets from the wider fleet as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-to-critical-national-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Challenges to Critical National Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The different components of Russia’s overall maritime sabotage capability pose different challenges to the critical infrastructure of European countries, which encompasses undersea cables, gas pipelines and windfarms, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep-diving submarines can sever cables at depths which make repairs extremely difficult. They can also tap sensitive undersea cables. However, these capabilities are limited in number and operated by only a few very specialised individuals. The GUGI, moreover, has a number of additional operational obligations, such as maintaining Russia’s undersea sensor networks and conducting surveillance near its maritime bastions. Additionally, the motherships on which deep-diving submarines depend for longer transits, such as the Belgorod, are likely to be detectable by NATO anti-submarine warfare assets to roughly the same degree as the submarines on which they are based were. A more pressing challenge than detecting capabilities is establishing rules of engagement, particularly in peacetime. In territorial waters, countries can prosecute foreign submarines they detect aggressively – something the Soviets frequently did with US submarines during the Cold War, and vice versa. In international waters, however, this is likely to be more of a challenge. That said, Western navies can complicate the activity of Russian special purpose submarines in other ways. For example, activity at or near the sensor networks for which the GUGI is responsible can force it to allocate scarce resources to more defensive functions. Alternatively, civil-military partnerships can be used to remove deniability. To use an example, the Italian Navy recently struck an agreement with the country’s largest internet provider to share data. Many private-sector actors operate sensors, including unmanned underwater vehicles and pressure detectors, to monitor damage. If claims made by a navy regarding the activity of a submarine in the vicinity of undersea cables can be verified through a private partner, this could raise the risk of attribution and set the conditions for other policy instruments such as sanctions to be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge posed by a combination of auxiliaries and surface vessels operated by the Russian Navy is a somewhat different one. These vessels cannot necessarily damage infrastructure such as undersea cables at depths that would make repairs especially difficult, but by virtue of being inconspicuous they are harder to track and identify. As the ambiguity around the Nord Stream blasts illustrates, this can pose a substantial challenge for attribution. That being said, there are also methods of interdiction against surface vessels that do not exist for subsurface assets. The 1884 Cable Convention, to which Russia is a signatory, allows navies to board and search ships in international waters if they believe them to be tampering with undersea cables – a right the US has exercised. Similarly, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) allows countries to constrain the activities of civilian vessels conducting surveillance relevant to economic exploitation within their exclusive economic zones (EEZs) – and most of these activities overlap substantially with the sort of surveillance a ship would need to do to survey infrastructure. In the Baltic and North Seas, which are almost entirely straddled by Western EEZs, this could be a basis for significantly limiting the freedom of action of Russian auxiliary ships while remaining within international law. To be sure, UNCLOS allows military vessels the right of surveillance within EEZs, but such vessels are readily identifiable in both peacetime and conflict, enabling attribution in peacetime and interdiction above the threshold of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge with regards to auxiliary ships is primarily one of classification. This challenge is in some ways not dissimilar to constabulary activities such as counter-smuggling or counterpiracy: it requires a suspect vessel to be identified in the midst of a large number of ships conducting normal economic activity. A number of measures could make this more robust. For example, we might consider recent work on the use of machine learning as well as more traditional algorithmic tools to identify irregular patterns of activity by a vessel. That said, to build the body of data needed to support these processes, Western navies will need presence in key theatres and greater levels of situational awareness than naval assets alone can provide. As the efforts of CTF-151 in the context of counterpiracy have illustrated, the sheer number of vessels needed for this level of presence means such efforts must necessarily be multinational. Given that NATO’s standing maritime groups typically do not control the assets needed for these functions in peacetime (though this may be changing), such functions could be achieved on a regional basis through framework nation constructs. In addition, the tasks of both surveillance and attribution would likely be made considerably easier if assets from across and beyond militaries could be used to both achieve domain awareness and attribute malign activity. Recent efforts by countries such as Italy to build relationships between its navy and the private sector stand out as examples. Similarly, the decision by France to make seabed security a national strategic concern coordinated across government may represent a step towards achieving this imperative. While naval assets will remain crucial for tasks from surveillance to interdiction, navies will likely need to have the organisational structures to coordinate with a broader range of actors in order to meet the challenge of maritime sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

The report examines Russian military adaptation by combat function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian infantry tactics have shifted from trying to deploy uniform Battalion Tactical Groups as combined arms units of action to a stratified division by function into line, assault, specialised and disposable troops. These are formed into task-organised groupings. Line infantry are largely used for ground holding and defensive operations. Disposable infantry are used for continuous skirmishing to either identify Ukrainian firing positions, which are then targeted by specialised infantry, or to find weak points in Ukrainian defences to be prioritised for assault. Casualties are very unevenly distributed across these functions. The foremost weakness across Russian infantry units is low morale, which leads to poor unit cohesion and inter-unit cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian engineering has proven to be one of the stronger branches of the Russian military. Russian engineers have been constructing complex obstacles and field fortifications across the front. This includes concrete reinforced trenches and command bunkers, wire-entanglements, hedgehogs, anti-tank ditches, and complex minefields. Russian mine laying is extensive and mixes anti-tank and victim-initiated anti-personnel mines, the latter frequently being laid with multiple initiation mechanisms to complicate breaching. These defences pose a major tactical challenge to Ukrainian offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian armour is rarely used for attempts at breakthrough. Instead, armour is largely employed in a fire support function to deliver accurate fire against Ukrainian positions. Russia has started to employ thermal camouflage on its vehicles and, using a range of other modifications and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), has significantly reduced the detectability of tanks at stand-off ranges. Furthermore, these measures have reduced the probability of kill of a variety of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) at ranges beyond 1,400 m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian artillery has begun to significantly refine the Reconnaissance Strike Complex following the destruction of its ammunition stockpiles and command and control infrastructure by guided multiple-launch rocket systems (GMLRS) in July 2022. This has resulted in much closer integration of multiple UAVs directly supporting commanders authorised to apply fires. Russian artillery has also improved its ability to fire from multiple positions and to fire and move, reducing susceptibility to counterbattery fire. The key system enabling this coordination appears to be the Strelets system. There has been a shift in reliance upon 152-mm howitzers to a much greater emphasis on 120-mm mortars in Russian fires; this reflects munitions and barrel availability. Responsive Russian fires represent the greatest challenge to Ukrainian offensive operations. Russian artillery is also increasingly relying on loitering munitions for counterbattery fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian electronic warfare (EW) remains potent, with an approximate distribution of at least one major system covering each 10 km of front. These systems are heavily weighted towards the defeat of UAVs and tend not to try and deconflict their effects. Ukrainian UAV losses remain at approximately 10,000 per month. Russian EW is also apparently achieving real time interception and decryption of Ukrainian Motorola 256-bit encrypted tactical communications systems, which are widely employed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian air defences have also seen a significant increase in their effectiveness now that they are set up around known, and fairly static, locations and are properly connected. Although Russia has persistently struggled to respond to emerging threats, over time it has adapted. Russian air defences are now assessed by the Ukrainian military to be intercepting a proportion of GMLRS strikes as Russian point defences are directly connected to superior radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian aviation remains constrained to delivering stand-off effects, ranging from responsive lofted S-8 salvos against Ukrainian forming-up points, to FAB-500 glide bombs delivered from medium altitude to ranges up to 70 km. The Ukrainian military notes that Russia has a large stockpile of FAB-500s and is systematically upgrading them with glide kits. Although they only have limited accuracy, the size of these munitions poses a serious threat. The Russian Aerospace Forces remain a ‘force in being’ and a major threat to advancing Ukrainian forces, although they currently lack the capabilities to penetrate Ukrainian air defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the destruction of Russian command and control infrastructure in July 2022, the Russian military withdrew major headquarters out of range of GMLRS and placed them in hardened structures. They also wired them into the Ukrainian civil telecommunications network and used field cables to branch from this to brigade headquarters further forward. Assigned assets tend to connect to these headquarters via microlink, significantly reducing their signature. At the same time, from the battalion down, Russian forces largely rely on unencrypted analogue military radios, reflecting a shortage of trained signallers at the tactical level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overview of Russian adaptation reveals a force that is able to improve and evolve its employment of key systems. There is evidence of a centralised process for identifying shortcomings in employment and the development of mitigations. Nevertheless, much of this adaptation is reactive and is aimed at making up for serious deficiencies in Russian units. The result is a structure that becomes better over time at managing the problems it immediately faces, but also one that struggles to anticipate new threats. The conclusion therefore is that the Russian Armed Forces pose a significant challenge for the Ukrainian military on the defence. Nevertheless, if Ukraine can disrupt Russian defences and impose a dynamic situation on them, Russian units are likely to rapidly lose their coordination. Changes in the air combat environment, for example, have led rapidly to incidents of Russian fratricide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine’s international partners, supporting Ukraine in liberating its territories is arguably shifting from an emphasis on key systems, to the need for dedicated training and the assurance that equipment provided to the Ukrainian military can be sustained. Tactics will be critical to the effective disruption of Russian forces and their eventual defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By any reasonable metric, 2022 was a disaster for the Russian military. After its invasion of Ukraine, a combination of uneven and inadequate training, poor force employment, and insufficient forces for sustained large-scale combat operations collectively caused the loss of many of its most capable troops and much of its modern equipment. The ground forces bore the brunt of these losses, though elements of the navy and aerospace forces suffered substantial attrition. Moreover, as international support for Ukraine has led to many Western weapons systems being employed against Russian troops for the first time, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) are confronting challenges they have not previously dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Moscow’s policy has been to continue the war. The ongoing reconstitution of Russian forces, and the pressure from new battlefield factors, have led to significant changes in how the Russian military fights. The study of the AFRF has often been heavily focused on the parsing of Russian doctrine. The relevance of Russian doctrine to how the AFRF fights, however, is becoming increasingly uneven. For Ukraine’s partners to calibrate their ongoing provision of support, it is important that Russia’s emerging tactics are properly understood. It is also important that NATO members, recapitalising their forces to ensure the future deterrence of Russia, understand how the threat is evolving. Although the Russian military may change considerably before its forces directly confront NATO, the evolution is worth tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report describes how Russia is currently carrying out its combat operations in Ukraine. It does not outline in detail which of these tactics are more or less successful, or describe Ukrainian tactics, as these are operationally sensitive. The material contained in this report has been primarily assembled from interviews with and observations of Ukrainian military units in April and May 2023, supported by similar material assembled throughout 2022. This included interviews in April and May 2023 with members of the 1st, 17th, 24th, 25th, 30th, 31st, 51st, 58th, 71st and 112th Brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) across all officer ranks and some enlisted troops. The interviewees had a wide range of experience throughout the war, including the defence of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Bakhmut and Avdiivka, and participated in offensive operations in Kherson and Kharkiv. The authors also spoke to several officers responsible for data collection, assessment and dissemination of lessons within the General Staff of the AFU, and with members of the staffs from Ukraine’s operational-level commands. The contents of these interviews were compared with the observations of a range of Ukraine’s international partners and from public source imagery and accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report divides the descriptions of Russian tactics by combat function, spanning infantry, engineers, artillery, armour, electronic warfare, air defence, aviation, and command and control. It concludes with an overview of the priorities for those wishing to support Ukraine in liberating its territory. This report should not be considered an academic analysis as it was written in Ukraine from field notes and does not engage extensively with wider literature. Nor, given the limitations on what can be publicly discussed, does it fully endeavour to analyse the implications of what is covered as doing so properly would breach the AFU’s operational security. Instead, this should be understood as reportage informed by sustained and extensive engagement and debriefing of Ukrainian combat units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are ways in which this report – if inappropriately exploited – could be misleading. In the first instance, an analysis that is premised on interviews could easily be a collection of anecdotes, thereby suggesting that isolated examples are reflective of wider trends. To avoid this, this report very rarely cites individual examples but instead outlines points of consistency between multiple accounts from combatants with experience from different sectors. Conversely, however, a report that seeks to describe a general Russian approach risks implying a level of uniformity, coherence and intentionality to tactics that may be very uneven in their application. It is noteworthy that there are regular studies conducted by different technical institutes of the Russian military and their findings are disseminated to combat formations, recommending alterations to the employment of equipment, and structure and application of formations. There is an ongoing process at work in the Russian military to identify lessons. Without unit rotation and collective training, however, it is hard for many of these recommendations to be implemented by troops in contact and the result is differing levels of adoption. At the same time, some tactics are emerging from the bottom up and are being distributed along the front. The reader should bear in mind therefore that the descriptions of how Russia is fighting in this report do not represent the result of a coherent redesign of force structure or combined arms tactics, but rather the adaptation within branches of the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, this report is not an operational study and does not seek to predict the likelihood of success in any Ukrainian offensive operations. Public reflections would be utterly inappropriate before any such actions are attempted. Given the roughly 1,200 km of front along which forces are engaged to varying levels of intensity, Russian positions are not uniformly well defended; there are gaps. Equally, not all of that front offers suitable ground for offensive manoeuvre. Just because the Russians have an approach to layered defence does not mean that those defences are well served or equally sophisticated in all sectors. Nevertheless, the tactical challenges outlined in this report are ones that Ukrainian forces will have to contend with to varying degrees in whichever direction they move to reclaim their territory. The authors hope that in outlining these challenges, this report can properly calibrate the expectations of Ukraine’s partners and indicate where their support can make the greatest difference in liberating Ukraine’s land and preserving the lives of its soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;infantry&quot;&gt;Infantry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the war, the Russian military operated in mechanised Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) which were supposed to be combined arms formations comprising mechanised infantry, tanks, artillery and other attached enablers. The Russians had insufficient infantry in their BTGs, while the units lacked cohesion or sufficient staff capacity to properly employ their combined arms elements. Casualties and the failure of the approach have led the AFRF to revert to relying on four infantry unit types: disposable; line; assault; and specialised. These are used in combination in both attack and defence, in a manner shaped by current operational challenges that is not formally codified in doctrine. Line, assault and specialised infantry are generated through the normal Russian recruitment and training system. Line infantry are generally based on mechanised units. They differ from assault infantry in that they have not received specific assault training and are therefore mainly used for supporting tasks, improving and occupying defensive positions. Assault infantry have received additional training, closer to what would be expected of NATO light infantry forces, and are considered to be a skilled and valuable asset. As such, they are spared some of the mundanity and back-breaking labour of digging in for defensive operations in order to prevent fatigue and attrition, and to allow them to conduct rehearsals for offensive operations. Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) and naval infantry units are generally, though not universally, assault units in practice, with a cultural expectation that they will have an esprit de corps, level of competence and appropriately aggressive mindset. Wagner Group and other Russian private military companies (PMCs) have also been involved in the formation of assault units. Specialised infantry might be generated from the infantry, VDV, the professional elements of Wagner Group, Spetsnaz or other corps, but have received additional role-specific training and equipment which allow for a particular kind of employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s disposable infantry should be considered fundamentally different and are drawn from three principal sources: conscripts from the Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics (heavily attrited from early rounds of fighting); prisoners drafted by the Wagner Group; and under-trained mobilised Russian civilians. These troops were originally formed into companies of approximately 60 people, but have since been broken down into platoons of approximately 15. They are issued with small arms. Ukrainian troops report that they often appear to be under the influence of amphetamines or other narcotic substances, with material recovered from the battlefield indicating that these are commonly taken in liquid form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the attack, disposable infantry are the first to be employed. Disposable platoons are assigned to those avenues of approach to Ukrainian positions that are deemed to offer some cover and thus could prove viable. Although these have been described colloquially as ‘human wave attacks’, they no longer involve a dense concentration of infantry conducting an assault in a single mass. Rather, a disposable fire team of two to five personnel is sent from a forming-up position in the Russian front line and advances to contact. There may be up to five fire teams pushed across an axis at any one time, but normally only one or two teams will be able to work forwards. The team will skirmish with Ukrainian defensive positions on contact, often until killed. Ukrainian troops noted that many continued to advance, even after being wounded. On more than one occasion Ukrainian soldiers report that disposable infantry have been shot from Russian positions when attempting to retreat. As teams are destroyed by defensive fire, Russian forces will commit successive teams forward by the same line of approach. Ukrainian forces must continuously defend their positions against consecutive waves, expending ammunition, exposing the locations of their defensive positions, and exhausting their personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these attacks were executed by capable assault troops motivated by factors other than coercion and narcotics, they would be roughly equivalent to historical assault tactics such as the ‘short attacks’ of the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army in the Korean War. The term ‘human wave attacks’ is certainly misleading for probes by successive small assault teams against enemy defences. However, the way that they are conducted is not conducive to successful assaults nor to the maintenance of momentum. Rather, the continuous conduct of this activity, across all axes, is a form of reconnaissance that allows the Russian forces to do two things. First, they find points of weakness in the Ukrainian defences where these troops make surprising amounts of progress or face very limited fire. These are then prioritised for deliberate assault. Alternatively, where the defence is strong, the revelation of Ukrainian firing positions allows specialised troops to begin targeting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian specialised troops are deployed as irregular groupings of snipers, artillery spotters and support weapon operators. While Ukrainian forces are suppressing disposable infantry, additional disposable troops are often pushed forwards as working groups to dig fox holes and prepare firing positions closer to Ukrainian defences. These personnel are withdrawn and replaced by specialists who can establish observation and sniping posts or set up heavy weapons. They can then be used to direct accurate fire against Ukrainian firing posts from a range of up to 2 km and inflict attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if a weaker point is identified and a deliberate assault is planned, the approach is to move additional disposable troops to dig forward positions for specialised infantry. Rather than seeking to simply attrit the defence, this becomes a base of fire. Furthermore, artillery fire shifts from harassment to barrage, enabling Russian assault infantry to attack – often favouring a flank. Assault infantry tend to advance in company strength with the support of armour and, among better Russian units, utilising a mixture of artillery systems. 152-mm howitzers fire until the assault is 400 m from the target position, after which fire is taken over by 122-mm howitzer or 120-mm mortar fire until the assault closes to its final assault positions. The final advance is covered by infantry mortars and then grenades are used before entering the target position. These troops tend to endeavour to turn the flank of a defensive position. On taking a position, they are often withdrawn and replaced by line infantry and additional disposable troops who set about fortifying the position so that it can be held as a base for further probing actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that, in the attack, Assault Detachments (‘Штурмовые отряды’) have long held a place in Soviet and Russian military doctrine, and the Russian military has produced updated manuals detailing how these should be structured and employed. In some ways the guidance provided is reflected in Russian offensive operations. The digging of forward positions in preparation for attacks, the use of artillery, the way that armoured vehicles are used separately for stand-off fire support, the use of specialist enabling teams, and the division of infantry platoons into three-to-five-man fire-teams, are all in evidence, although with great variation from the strict doctrinal task organisation provided. Furthermore, probably because to do so would be politically untenable, the doctrine makes no distinction between the specially trained assault infantry teams that form the backbone of assault detachments and their disposable counterparts. The divergence between doctrine and observed practice likely owes much to the inability of the AFRF to either train according to the doctrine or implement it effectively and consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the defence, Russian forces largely occupy company fighting positions with platoon-sized elements that utilise minefields and obstacles to slow down and fix attackers before calling for heavy defensive artillery fire. If forced from their positions, they will utilise artillery fires to prevent either breakthroughs or consolidation by the attacker. Although Russian defensive operations have been criticised as being overly positional, they do hold ground combat units in reserve for mobile defence. Although their less capable units have consistently proven sluggish and reactive, on occasion they have launched rapid, aggressive counterattacks to retake lost positions in response to successful Ukrainian assaults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is notable that Russian doctrine, with a heavy emphasis on direct and indirect fires, has long prescribed that formations should dig in as soon as possible when static. If no engineering support is available, they are to do so by hand, and are to continue to improve their positions for the duration that they occupy them. As a result, Russian positions often include an extensive range of well-prepared fighting positions. Once Russian troops have taken a position, it is reliably fortified within 12 hours through the digging of fox holes or blasting on less favourable ground. This is rapidly augmented in frontline positions with cut-down trees to create strongpoints for support weapons. Positions are reinforced with concrete where possible, although this is rarely the case in the first line. They also make limited use of decoy positions to obscure the layout of their actual defensive positions and fires plan, although the extent of this practice varies across units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian defence lines are significant and the units holding them post sentries, the Russians make very little use of observation or listening posts pushed forward of their main positions. Active reconnaissance, other than advancing to contact with disposable troops, is largely carried out by UAVs. Indeed, Russian troops appear to be reluctant to expose themselves through reconnaissance. Even when reconnaissance units work forward, it is usually to launch UAVs. It is typical for there to be between 25 and 50 UAVs from both sides operating over the contested area between the forward line of own troops (FLOT) and forward line of enemy troops (FLET) at any given time for each 10 km of frontage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this force structure is a cynical but coherent solution to the problem facing the Russian Ground Forces; they are able to mobilise large numbers of personnel but most units are poor quality and suffer from a chronic lack of training capacity that might otherwise rectify the problem. The segmented tasking within an unevenly trained force places correspondingly uneven burdens on its different components. The losses among disposable infantry are extremely high. Conversely, because specialised troops are largely held back and often fight from well-prepared positions, the Russians are able to preserve these soldiers thereby steadily increasing the skill of these operators. Meanwhile, assault troops are preserved from some of the worst of the fighting and receive better body armour and equipment. They are often only committed under the most favourable circumstances, meaning they can achieve their objectives and be rotated out with limited losses. On the other hand, when they are committed under less favourable circumstances, whether because of Ukrainian deception measures or miscalculation by their command, these forces are assigned the most dangerous task and are thus prone to mass casualty incidents. It is also worth noting that the competence of these units varies considerably and depends on the proportion of replacements in the force, the level of training received and their resulting unit cohesion. VDV and naval infantry units, for example, have seen significant qualitative decline over the course of the war owing to regeneration. By contrast, because Wagner assault units often comprise companies, they are either lost or succeed. Moreover, the higher pay attracts experienced personnel from contract infantry and leads to more capable specialist Wagner units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical and yet most elusive variable in assessing the strength of Russian military units is morale. Generally, it is low, with a rise in prosecutions for desertion, observed instances of wounded comrades being abandoned, and very little depth of junior leadership. Personnel are also rarely rotated and there is considerable weariness across the force. In theory, this should make Russian units brittle. In practice, they appear to be able to take very heavy punishment without collapsing. Instead, morale problems appear to manifest in poor cooperation within units and even less between them. The result is a tendency for coordination and cohesion to fracture under pressure. This is likely to make Russian units underperform in defence if they can be forced to move or engage in a dynamic action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engineers&quot;&gt;Engineers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the least discussed elements of the Russian forces during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has been its engineers. In contrast to much of the Russian forces, its engineers have performed well. The aforementioned speed with which Russian infantry dig, and the scale at which they improve their fighting positions, is noteworthy and is supplemented by combat engineers. Two engineer companies are assigned to each brigade, one focused on mining and the other on force protection engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian force protection engineering has largely followed its doctrine, with little methodological change since the Cold War. Russian defensive positions generally comprise two to three lines, depending on the context. The first line, along the line of contact, comprises the fighting positions made by the infantry. The second constitutes properly made trenches – as compared with fox holes in the first – and concrete firing posts where possible. Several obstacle belts are laid in front of these positions, usually formed with a 4-m-deep and 6-m-wide anti-tank ditch, dragons’ teeth and wire track entanglements. The trench positions are usually structured as company fighting positions in wood blocks and on ridge lines, placed to cover areas of open ground with fire, rather than as contiguously occupied front lines. The depth of the defence line is usually 5 km from the first, and each belt of physical defences tends to span between 700 m and a kilometre, so that the entire obstacle series is covered by fire. The third line usually comprises fall-back fighting positions and concealed areas for reserves, with positions dug for vehicles. Command posts (CPs), meanwhile, tend to be subterranean and fortified with concrete. The overall depth of defensive fortifications exceeds 30 km on some axes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minefields are another element of the Russian defence line. These rarely follow a discernible pattern and are seldom marked. Ukrainian forces note that the Russians have no shortage of mines, creating mixed fields containing both anti-tank (AT) and anti-personnel (AP) mines. Russia is not a signatory of the 1997 Ottawa Treaty, meaning its forces freely utilise victim-initiated AP mines. They tend to leave lanes for rearward movement between the forward, first and second defence lines. There is also a strong preference for mining the approaches to natural choke points. In some cases, an AP mine may be placed directly on top of the AT mine. Initiation mechanisms are also often mixed. It is common for AP mines, for example, to be initiated by a seismic sensor and to have an immediately adjacent mine initiated by wires, which are laid out in a cross from the device. The Russians have also made extensive use of magnetically activated AT mines delivered via multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS). Although Russian forces have been successful in tracking the routes through their own minefields, they have performed less well in breaching mine belts laid by the AFU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area in which the Russians have demonstrated persistent competence is in the emplacement of bridges. These are largely held at the Combined Arms Army level and assigned to support operations. Engineering units usually emplace them rapidly and there is no evidence that the Russian Ground Forces lack for pontoon bridges, even if their river crossing operations have exhibited serious shortcomings overall. Russian forces are sufficiently confident that they can rapidly deploy bridging that they have at times destroyed bridges, even on routes that they intend to utilise, because they assess that the disruption to Ukrainian forces is greater than the burden of having to erect pontoons across the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;artillery&quot;&gt;Artillery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery reamins at the heart of the Russian military. During the initial invasion, between one and two batteries of howitzers were assigned to each BTG along with an MLRS battery. By summer 2022, the Russians had consolidated artillery into artillery tactical groups. Russia is currently utilising artillery brigades, which allocate batteries in support of axes, and hold a significant force under direct command for counterbattery fire and to support the sector’s main effort. Russian fires continue to be the main shaping effect on the fighting. The rate of Russian fire during the first quarter of 2023 fluctuated between 12,000 and 38,000 rounds per day. The number of days in which Russian fires exceeded 24,000 rounds is now much scarcer, and it is notable that – in terms of the allocation of fires – Russian artillery ammunition and barrel allocations are assigned to fewer priority axes. There has also been a shift in the calibres being most widely utilised with a relative reduction in the volume of 152-mm fire and a significant increase in the volume of 120-mm mortar fire. Thus, whereas total ammunition expenditure in 2022 was approximately 12 million rounds, fluctuating between 20,000 and 60,000 rounds fired per day, Russian fires in 2023 are currently trending closer towards 7 million rounds if the current rate of fire is maintained for the remainder of the year. Ukrainian estimates place current Russian shell production at 2.5 million rounds per year. This is likely to increase, although access to explosive energetics constrains it. Due to the disparity in expenditure versus production, additional rounds are purchased from the international market. Nevertheless, with a projected consumption rate of 7 million rounds over the whole of 2023, Russia will have to be more discerning in where it prioritises its fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ammunition availability has shaped employment. The Russians had no difficulty in amassing ammunition around their guns in Donbas in summer 2022. After HIMARS strikes disrupted these supply practices, and the availability of accurate long-range Western howitzers in the AFU made this stockpiling difficult, the Russian approach to fire control was disrupted. What has followed has been a process of experimentation and refinement that is beginning to produce new tactics. The Russians have introduced two terms into their fires lexicon: ‘immediate value’; and ‘weight of salvo’. The first reflects the uneven effects of fire based on the tactical context and thus the need for precise timing of the delivery of fires in relation to the wider actions of a unit. Thus, fires planning is now framed as a series of decision points. The second – weight of salvo – is also reflective of a shift in emphasis to the timing of effects, desiring to land the greatest weight within a defined period to maximise effect. The patterns of fire are being described as ‘Nomadic Cannon’, ‘Fiery Carousel’, ‘Roaming Platoon’ and ‘Umbrella Cover’. The Nomadic Cannon reflects harassing fire, delivered from mobile firing points, often to draw counterbattery fire or conduct artillery raids. The Fiery Carousel reflects a means of maintaining survivability while sustaining barrage. The Roaming Platoon concept envisages manoeuvring guns maximising the weight of salvo deliverable against a target. Umbrella Cover is essentially a means of suppression. Gun positions are no longer dug. Instead, a battery will conceal itself in a woodblock and move to a firing position where ammunition will have been placed for a defined salvo. It will then move to the next. If fixed by counterbattery fire, operators tend to leave their guns and seek cover, only returning to them when it is safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire is not only used to strike Ukrainian defensive positions but also, vitally, to blunt assaults. If the Russians learn that an assault is being prepared, the area is often saturated with fire to prevent its execution. Another common tactic is for the Russians to withdraw from a position that is being assaulted and then saturate it with fire once Ukrainian troops attempt to occupy it. Ukrainian forces report that while the weight of artillery fire remains high, MLRS launches are significantly less than in previous months, suggesting munitions shortages. It appears that Russia has a steady supply of Krasnopol laser-guided 152-mm rounds as there is an observed increase in the number of Orlan-30 flights and the use of designators by specialised infantry to deliver more accurate strikes on Ukrainian defensive positions. Russian counterbattery fire has also shifted away from the saturation of detected Ukrainian positions to the firing of Lancet loitering munitions. Although these have a limited success rate, their speed and accuracy make it challenging to maintain sustained firing for Ukrainian guns to support manoeuvre. Lancets are also used for reconnaissance to actively hunt for Ukrainian artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More consequential than adaptations in firing sequences has been the refinement of the Russian Reconnaissance Fires Circuit (Russian term for the kill chain) to make it more responsive and more flexible in delivering fire to support manoeuvring forces. Each commander of an axis will generally retain an orbit of Orlan-10s above the fighting to provide both information to the CP and targets for responsive and accurate fire to the assigned batteries. The artillery brigade commander also often retains several Orlan-10s, coordinated in a complex above areas of interest. Thus, Ukrainian forces often find that they are being observed from two different Orlan-10 complexes – each able to call down different effects. The time for artillery engagements from these systems remains rapid at around 3–5 minutes. Engagement from electronic warfare (EW) detection is longer at around 20–30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One underappreciated aspect of Russian fires reconnaissance early in the conflict was the Strelets system. It allows multiple feeds from ground-based sensors or detections by reconnaissance troops to be programmed and transmitted through a wide range of bearers, which are then integrated into Russian digital fire control. Few Russian units were found to have Strelets during the initial invasion, and even among those that had it, it was often not set up properly or left in baggage. Although the low quality of training among Russian troops means that it is still not prevalent, it is widely used among specialist infantry assigned to VDV and Wagner formations. These personnel use Strelets to either place sensors close to Ukrainian positions or report and correct for fire for Russian artillery to enable accurate engagements. The combination of calls for fires enabled by Strelets, combined with the Reconnaissance Fire Complexes (RFCs) of higher echelons fires using organic ISR is outlined in Figure 1. The figure shows three interlocking kill chains or ‘reconnaissance fires circuits’ from a direct link between reconnaissance and fires assets, to a link between reconnaissance assets through a fire control to a battery, and the ability of a higher headquarters to assign alternate ‘means of destruction’ against a detected target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actions of Russian assault groups against the village of Artemivske in December 2022 provides a useful illustration of the application of the RFC as it has developed in Ukraine. Several UAVs were used to fly above the assault groups in the city: one conducted reconnaissance outside the city against the positions of the Ukrainian artillery; another maintained observation over possible routes for transferring reserves; a third preceded the assault group to identify Ukrainian ambushes and firing positions; and a fourth flew above the assault group itself, giving the assault group commander real time observation of the tactical situation. If any of the UAVs identified a target, the UAV operator would pass the coordinates to the assault group commander. If the target was to be engaged with artillery this would be either ordered by the assault group commander and carried out by the artillery attached to the group, or transferred to the higher command, operating its own UAVs over the area, which could take over the fire mission with its assets. In this instance, the engagements were managed by the Strelets system. The applied architecture for this bypassing of centralised fire control for the delivery of effects through a tiered RFC is outlined in Figure 2. In the figure, information flows from the UAV both to the CP, but also to a fire observer directly to the barrels via the Strelets system, indicated by the black line. Thus the commander is on, but does not need to be in the loop for the engagement to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;armour&quot;&gt;Armour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian use of armour has evolved significantly during the conflict. The BTG concept included the use of armour in company groups to punch into operational depth. After taking massive losses, the Russians shifted to using armour for attempts at breakthrough when conditions were propitious. Now, tanks are very rarely used in this way, with the destruction of a Russian naval infantry brigade in Vuhledar attempting such an armoured thrust, reinforcing Russia’s caution in using such tactics under current conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, tanks tend to operate in three ways. First, they are used to supplement artillery capabilities through indirect engagements. This is particularly notable in sectors off the Russian main effort where there is not a sufficient allocation of air defences to protect a robust logistics architecture capable of supporting a large numbers of guns. Because of the low angle of indirect fire engagements by tanks, they make for an inefficient form of artillery. Nevertheless, these engagements can often be made from positions that would not be viable for artillery because of the tanks greater protection and thus reduced vulnerability to counterbattery fire, enabling tanks to fill in the gap in firing while guns displace or become suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, tanks are used as highly accurate fire support assets able to stand off at 2 km and utilise their enhanced optics to identify and knock out firing positions. It is important to note that while the introduction of older tanks such as the T62 and T55 to the field has been mocked online, these vehicles are largely being used in the role of the fire support function offered by BMPs and other infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs). They represent an increase in range, protection and kinetic effect over these IFVs, and therefore pose a serious battlefield threat when there are a limited number of anti-tank guided weapons able to reach them at their stand-off range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third use of armour is in raiding. Because of the continual pressure that Russian infantry place Ukrainian positions under, this requires regular troop rotations. Striking troops during these rotations significantly increases the likelihood of inflicting casualties, so the Russians often conduct gun raids with tanks when they detect troop rotations. These are often carried out at night, specifically utilising T80BV with its better thermal optics. The aim is to rapidly approach the target sector, fire as many rounds as possible within a short space of time and withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important development is that the Russians have made several modifications to their tanks that are reducing the effectiveness of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). First, they are fitting vehicles – as well as many defensive positions – with anti-thermal material, which is proving highly effective. Second, modification to the engine deck and thus the heat plume from the vehicle’s exhaust and engine is reducing the reliability of where certain ATGMs engage the target. Third, by fighting at dusk and dawn when the vehicle temperature is most similar to the ambient temperature of the surroundings (known as ‘thermal crossover’), the vehicles are harder to detect through thermal imagery. The result is a significant decrease in the probability of kill from several ATGM types, although this is only achievable by imposing a range of tactical constraints on the employment of Russian armour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exceptions to the patterns outlined above can be found in urban fighting where distances often collapse. Although Russian forces have proven very cautious in using armour in Bakhmut, they have pushed armour in a supporting fire role for infantry in other urban battles. Here, tanks have proven critical for both suppression of urban structures and rapid breaching of buildings to avoid entering through choke points and known avenues of advance. The use of older tanks as assault guns in this role appears to be preferred as the urban environment does not give more modern Russian tanks with advanced optics and multispectral concealment a sufficient tactical advantage to justify their loss. Of course, as tanks are drawn into urban areas for this purpose, they also risk coming into direct contact with enemy armour, with armoured clashes sometimes taking place from distances as close as 50 m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tank-on-tank engagements have become relatively rare, but when they occur they usually take place within 1,000 m. Engagement speed has been the determining factor in these clashes. Ukrainian tankers note that one-shot kills are possible if the point between the turret and glacis is hit. Russian explosive reactive armour (ERA), however, has proven highly effective, preventing most anti-tank systems from defeating the tank’s armour. Some operators have reported hitting tanks multiple times with barrel-launched ATGMs without knocking them out. Significantly, Ukrainian tankers report that mobility kills against the vehicle’s tracks are also an effective means of removing Russian armour from the field because they usually cause the crew to abandon the vehicle. This is because a tank’s mobility is considered the best means of protection against artillery and its survivability is compromised if it is immobilised. On several occasions, this tendency for stricken armour to be abandoned has led to extended skirmishing by both sides to try and recover damaged vehicles. On balance, Russian fires superiority tends to prevent Ukrainian troops from successfully lifting enemy armour under these conditions, meaning the vehicles are usually denied with artillery to prevent their recovery and repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;electronic-warfare&quot;&gt;Electronic Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic warfare remains a critical component of the Russian way of fighting. While there was an extremely high density of EW systems in Donbas in 2022, the AFRF now employ approximately one major EW system per 10 km of frontage, usually situated approximately 7 km from the frontline, with more specialised EW capabilities sat at higher echelon. These platforms are usually aimed at controlling and defeating UAVs. Interestingly, there is minimal interest among Russian crews in synchronising these effects with other activities or with deconflicting their effects. Instead, for the period when an EW team is deployed, it is weapons free with its system and tends to aggressively attack Ukrainian systems. The Shipovnik-Aero is proving a particularly effective system because it has a low signature and can further obfuscate this by imitating other emitters and communications devices. It also has a sophisticated range of effects for downing UAVs. The Russian military is also continuing to make extensive use of navigational interference in the battle area as a form of electronic protection. This is contributing to a Ukrainian loss rate in UAVs of approximately 10,000 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another function of Russian EW troops is interception and decryption of Ukrainian military communications. The Russian military is proving highly capable in this area. Ukrainian officers recalled one incident in which the Russian headquarters gave pre-emptive warning to its units of an artillery strike based on Ukrainian troops calling in a fire mission. The Ukrainian troops were communicating with Motorola radios with 256-bit encryption, but it appeared that the Russians were able to capture and decrypt these transmissions in near real time. The most likely system for such functions is the Torn-MDM. When the Russians are not intercepting traffic, Ukrainian units note that they are reliably able to suppress the receivers on Motorola radios out to approximately 10 km beyond the FLET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside large systems such as the Shipovnik-Aero, the Russian military has been extensively rolling out EW effectors to be organic to units at all echelons. This includes counter-UAS capabilities assigned to each platoon, which usually include directional jammers and arrays for hijacking UAVs. Ukrainian forces now assess that at least one of these systems is available to each platoon within Russian line infantry units. Another EW function in the counter-UAS fight is deception measures that generate a large number of fake UAVs on enemy systems and replicate ground control stations. While the Russian military is yet to widely exploit the creation of a large number of false targets, it has the capability to do so – and these actions are growing more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;air-defence&quot;&gt;Air Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance of Russian air defence systems has steadily improved. Early setbacks due to poor coordination and planning saw Ukraine successfully strike Russian formations during the initial week of the war. The Russians rapidly established a more robust coverage over their tactical formations, which quickly denied airspace to the Ukrainian Air Force. Nevertheless, this was premised on a large number of dispersed air defence systems, and these proved vulnerable to complex attacks involving anti-radiation missiles and EW effects. The Russians also found that dispersed air defence systems were incapable of intercepting a range of threats, including guided multiple launch rocket systems (GMLRS) used to devastate Russian command and control and logistics in July 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian air defences have become significantly more robust since the autumn of 2022. Complexes of SA-21 and SA-23 are now stationed around key logistical and C2 hubs. Critically, they appear to have SA-15 and SA-22 connected to their fire control radars, significantly improving the situational awareness and track data quality of these short-range air defence (SHORAD) systems. This has had two principal effects. First, the long-range radar, combined with systems such as the 48Ya6 ‘Podlet-K1’ all-altitude radar, have proven highly effective in denying airspace to Ukrainian aviation. Second, Russian SHORAD systems have massively improved their point defence efficiency. Along with the successful interception of most high-speed anti-radiation missiles (HARMs) fired by Ukrainian aircraft, the Russian air defence network is now assessed to be achieving a significant number of intercepts against GMLRS munitions. The exact intercept rate depends on the depth of the target and the number of GMLRS fired, so that a precise proportion of intercepts cannot be meaningfully given. Russian air defences are clearly much more effective in defence when they can be properly connected, than in a dynamic context where they are having to cover advancing forces. This allows Russian crews to achieve optimal efficiency against the current range of threats. It is noteworthy however that Russian crews have always lagged in reacting appropriately to new threats, and struggle to maintain effective blue force tracking, leading to several blue-on-blue engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of Russian long-range surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) against the Ukrainian Air Force has also remained significant. The longest-known shoot-down against Ukrainian aircraft was at 150 km when the aircraft was flying lower than 50 feet. This appears to have been cued by a 48Ya6 ‘Podlet-K1’ all-altitude radar with the air defence missile achieving a post-apex lock on the target. The strength of the air defence network is bolstered by persistent combat air patrols at medium altitude by Russian Su-35Ss. Using R-37 missiles, these aircraft pose a significant threat at very long range. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, the longest-range recorded kill by a Russian R-37 was at 177 km. Although separate from the air defence system, the combination of threat from long-range ground-based anti-air capabilities, medium-altitude look-down radar, long-range air-to-air missiles, and effective point defence systems makes the air combat environment extremely lethal. For this reason, most Ukrainian fast air and attack aviation engagements utilise S-7 rockets, fired in a lofted profile from above Ukrainian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aviation&quot;&gt;Aviation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the greater density and integration of Russian air defences, the VKS continues to be reluctant to push into Ukrainian airspace. Russian aviation has largely continued to conduct stand-off attacks. First, aviation-launched cruise missiles now constitute the majority of stand-off effects used for the protracted targeting of Ukrainian sites. The Tu-95 fleet remains the backbone of this capability. It is noteworthy that a large number of aircraft are assigned to these strikes, with a relatively small proportion of aircraft firing the munitions. Here, the VKS has adapted in response to the limited number of strikes possible per month leading to Ukrainian defences gaining significant warning time of strikes through the take-off of these aircraft. Given that Russian industry can deliver approximately 40 long-range missiles of varying types per month, the VKS launches large numbers of aircraft to increase the number of potential axes of threat, using Shahed-136 UAVs as pathfinders to identify gaps in Ukrainian air defence and then firing from a small number of aircraft to maximise the proportion of missiles that reach their target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stand-off effects are also the principal means of the VKS conducting strikes in tactical depth, largely employing FAB-500 bombs with glide kits launched from Su-35Ss; with a potential range of up to 70 km, these munitions have relatively poor accuracy. The AFU notes that the VKS holds substantial stockpiles of FAB-500s and is systematically preparing glide kits for them, potentially providing a large number of available heavy bombs. For now, Russian use of these munitions has been small, although strikes have been persistent. It is anticipated, however, that these strikes are providing data for the refinement of the glide kits and, more importantly, for the calculation tables used to determine when they are released, which may see an improvement in accuracy over time. If employed with greater concentration, it is also anticipated that this capability will begin to be employed against battlefield targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other stand-off strike method is lofting S-8 unguided rockets from both fast air and aviation assets on a long arcing trajectory at distant targets. The technique, first seen soon after the invasion, has been the subject of significant curiosity due to its inefficiency and inaccuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when conducted at ranges of approximately 12 km at area targets such as Ukrainian ground formations attempting to form up for attacks, the concentration of effect has proved sufficient to break up these formations and prevent attacks from taking place. Interestingly, these lofting strikes appear to be the primary use of Russian attack aviation on the current battlefield. Although the technique is used across the front, its most pronounced effects are in areas where the Russians have a dearth of ground-based fires, as the responsiveness of this method of attack can increase the threat to Ukrainian troops with very little notice. The second use of Russian aviation is the application of EW effects. There are believed to be eight Russian Mi-17s with EW suites operating in southern Ukraine. These are being utilised to some effect for the purposes of electronic attack against Ukrainian command and control, and through their altitude are able to do so in greater depth than is achievable by comparable systems based on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VKS remains something of an enigma in the conflict. On the one hand, it retains significant firepower and a large fleet of available aircraft with munitions. On the other hand, its presence is limited. The challenge for Ukraine is that Russian fast air, and particularly its large extant attack aviation fleet, could inflict massive damage if committed in numbers, even if this would be costly. So long as this represents a latent threat, it must have a shaping effect on Ukrainian offensive operations, as advancing Ukrainian forces are likely to face similar challenges to the Russians in advancing their air defence coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prize to be fought for in this regard is the ability to operate at medium altitude beyond the engagement ceiling of shoulder-fired man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS). Whichever side can operate sustainably in this altitude band can more easily identify targets and bomb with much greater range and accuracy. At present, the VKS is deterred by the SAM threat from adopting such a profile over the Ukrainian frontlines. However, probably the single greatest extant threat that could change the tactical dynamics on the ground is if the VKS gains the freedom to operate at medium altitude over Ukrainian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;command-and-control&quot;&gt;Command and Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GMLRS strikes by Ukrainian forces in July 2022 pushed Russian headquarters back to beyond 120 km from the FLOT. In autumn 2022, this distance imposed significant tactical challenges on Russian forces. However, these challenges had largely been overcome by winter. Russian headquarters are now more dispersed and are connected to forward CPs by wiring. This has often been achieved by commandeering the Ukrainian telecommunications network on the occupied territories, which is dense and robust. The Russian military then connect its CPs to the closest point in the civilian network via extended ground-laid telecommunications cables. Brigade CPs remain pushed back from the front line, usually to a distance of 20 km, but are often well protected, being situated underground in reinforced structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dispersion of orders from CPs to key assets such as air defence, EW and other systems has been observed to depend on microlinks in the first instance, often using relay vehicles to increase the range at which combat management can be carried out. Microlink use has significantly decreased the detectability of these systems. It is noted that brigade to battalion CPs are often either connected via microlink relays or field cable, which are usually laid within 24 hours of a CP being established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the low detectability of these command links, Russian communications from the battalion CP downwards are not just dependent on radios but often on analogue military systems and tend to be communicated in clear rather than encrypted. This is presumed to be the result of the limited training provided to many components of the force. Moreover, while some units have developed forms of veiled speech, most do not adhere to these practices. The exception to this is among reconnaissance units and artillery observers able to utilise systems such as Strelets and Azart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regards cooperation between units, Russian forces continue to struggle to be horizontally integrated in their C2. The layering of fires, for example, between combined arms army assets, brigade artillery and battalion mortars, demonstrates reasonable fires integration between echelons. However, there is limited application of cross-boundary fires between sectors. Nor is there much evidence that units have the means to communicate laterally. Instead, information is passed upwards, then across at the brigade level or higher, and then downwards. This is a major limitation in Russian defensive operations as it creates seams that must be covered by higher echelons with organic assets. Integration of VKS capabilities also remains tied to the Combined Arms Army CP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;priority-assistance-for-the-armed-forces-of-ukraine&quot;&gt;Priority Assistance for the Armed Forces of Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine prepares for offensive operations, it is important to consider the tactical challenges that the AFU will face. How Ukraine plans to overcome these challenges is operationally sensitive and will not be detailed in this report. Nevertheless, some priorities for those supporting Ukrainian forces can be identified through the analysis of Russian capabilities outlined above, and by some of those issues facing the AFU which are already clearly identifiable in open sources. Russian infantry, when properly supported, can make Ukrainian offensive operations challenging. Specifically, the volume of Russian fires, their protection by air defences, the extent of Russian force protection engineering, and the ability to disrupt mobile command and control all represent tactical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia’s defensive operations are positional, a cardinal sin among adherents of manoeuvre warfare, defeating the layers of prepared defences still presents a problem. These defences are not absolutely positional, with Russian forces utilising some mobile reserves at the tactical level. The depth of the defences means that Ukraine must generate serious combat power to penetrate the Russian lines, and the extent of Russian defensive fortifications across the front makes bypassing them nearly impossible. Even if Ukrainian forces achieve a breakthrough in future, and regain their ability to manoeuvre, this will require localised breakthroughs and mopping up operations against bypassed defensive positions. This means that, although there are a variety of likely tasks for Ukrainian ground units and they will need to be able to manoeuvre, training for assault operations against fortified positions constitutes a critical training priority for Ukrainian troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first obstacle for Ukrainian forces is winning the indirect fires duel. In the face of enemy artillery dominance, offensive manoeuvre is extremely costly. Ukraine’s international partners have provided a large number of artillery systems and the country is receiving a consistent supply of ammunition, although the natures provided do not always reflect the balance of calibres available to the AFU. However, the real issue is that the priority for provisioning Ukrainian artillery for defence has left its fires system lopsided in its capabilities. Ukrainian artillery has ample means to blunt Russian advances, with an effective fire control architecture and the ability to coordinate engagements from multiple dispersed guns. However, suppression of a superior number of Russian artillery systems requires counterbattery capabilities to rapidly detect and engage enemy firing positions. It is evident that if Ukrainian forces are to set the conditions in any sector for offensive action, its international partners should prioritise the provision of detection systems for directing counterbattery fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winning the firefight in direct engagements is also critical, as suppressing enemy positions during assault actions is essential. As regards heavy weapons, a significant emphasis has been placed on . calibre heavy machine guns equipping Ukrainian units. While these are highly effective, their fire has a very flat trajectory. They would be complemented well by automatic grenade launchers such as the Mk. 19 Grenade Machine Gun (GMG), which would pose a greater threat to enemy troops in trenches or dug into open positions, given the arcing trajectory of rounds. Assisting Ukrainian forces with winning the direct firefight is also worthwhile because, unlike some other capabilities, it can be improved in a standalone fashion, the training and weapons systems in question not requiring other dependencies to be in place before adding value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine clearing and breaching is another area where Ukraine’s partners must prioritise support. The key requirement is likely minefield reconnaissance. The utilisation of machine learning tools with UAV reconnaissance could be a means of identifying fields. Nevertheless, reconnaissance in this function is also likely to require human scouting and marking, which is a difficult skill and should be taught so Ukrainian reconnaissance troops can do this at night. It is also important to note that while offensive obstacle breaching at tempo is something that Western militaries have under-resourced, counter-IED equipment and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) developed during the war on terror do have applicability. The challenge is adapting these to work under an indirect fire threat that was not significant when these tactics were first employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the emphasis for international support has understandably been on equipment. Tactics, however, will be decisive in determining whether Ukrainian infantry are able to succeed on the battlefield, particularly the challenge of taking entrenched and fortified positions protected by minefields and supporting fires. While there are several critical skill sets that can be identified, there are a variety of common battle drills that are the bread and butter of well-trained ground combat and combat support units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Ukraine faces multiple pressures which serve as major impediments to honing the skills, tactical coordination and group cohesion of its units. It is required to deploy its best units on ongoing operations along an extended front line in eastern Ukraine. Furthermore, Ukraine’s training establishments are having to process an influx of new recruits with limited prior military training. These recruits must both replace the casualties from existing units and facilitate the expansion of the AFU. This is no easy feat and comes after the training establishments were severely disrupted early in the war, including in some cases being physically overrun by Russian Ground Forces, or having the instructors and students mobilised at the beginning of the war as an emergency measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of training assistance required should therefore not be underestimated, for it is substantial and complex. Collective training for units must be prioritised, with a particular focus on fire control for direct and indirect fire support units to maximise suppression without wasting ammunition, effective tactical command and control of, and between, fire support, engineering and assault units to ensure effective suppression during breaching and assaults without fratricide, and the conduct of assaults themselves. The relevant battle drills are not particularly complex conceptually, but they must be understood well enough by all involved for there to either be no requirement to submit a planning process beforehand, or for that planning and delivery of orders to be quick and concise so as to minimise vulnerable pauses in operational activity. They require thorough practice under realistic conditions to build sufficient coordination to be effective, and for there to be the speed and momentum to prevent the enemy from responding effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to build effective assault units with common tactics also speaks to a wider requirement for company-level collective training to ensure consistent TTPs and develop unit cohesion. Here, developing leaders who are able to coordinate multiple elements as part of platoon-, company- and battalion-strength tactical engagements at pace will be vital. The emphasis on individual soldiering skills in UK training provided to Ukrainian recruits, while an important foundation, underplays the vital importance of building formed units if offensive actions are to succeed. If this means slowing down the number of trainees passing through the UK programme by adding an additional couple of weeks of collective training, then the trade-off would be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukrainian units break through the defences, it is vital that they can exploit the gap they have created. If their offensive operations lack momentum, this will lead to a series of sequential assaults against prepared Russian defences – a slow and disproportionately costly way to take ground. Conversely, they will maximise the return on the costs of each assault if they are able to breach and exploit forwards, thereafter, keeping Russian forces on the back foot. To do this, they must maintain tempo and remain protected as they move forwards. This leads to two requirements. For the maintenance of tempo, the availability and serviceability of equipment is vital. While this can be done in defence by recovering vehicles and having trained mechanics work on them, the maintenance of equipment provided by international partners during offensive operations will largely depend on the proficiency of crews in keeping them fighting. For this reason, it is critical that there is an available stockpile of spare parts for all donated equipment, that user manuals have been translated into Ukrainian and distributed to the appropriate units, and that crews have time to properly familiarise themselves with equipment that follows a very different maintenance methodology from platforms on which they have previously operated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second critical requirement for maintaining momentum is the protection of forces that have broken through from counterattacks by those Russian forces held in reserve. Reserve manoeuvre elements can be fixed with artillery so long as they can be located. Defensive enemy artillery fire must be obviated by maintaining momentum and therefore denying the enemy real-time location data on targets. This means disrupting their means of holding units under observation. Meanwhile, protecting units from aviation is critical to prevent a responsive set of strikes to blunt a breakthrough. For the defeat of enemy artillery, some deployable EW capabilities may be useful, but whether for UAVs or aviation, tactical air defence is by far the greatest priority. The ability to have air defence move with and shield manoeuvre elements is a vital area that requires potentially novel support from Ukraine’s partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the disruption of enemy counterattacks or strikes from artillery and aviation would be greatly assisted by the destruction of enemy command and control infrastructure. For this, suppression of the air defences protecting these targets will be important. Assistance in both stand-off electronic attack and the use of tools such as UAVs to threaten and displace air defences or else saturate them with false positives or non-economical targets could all greatly assist in creating confusion, overwhelming enemy decision-making and reducing the level of protection to maximise the impact of Ukrainian GMLRS strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tendency in much of the international discourse surrounding the Russian military has been to write it off as tactically inept, technically deficient and morally broken. These criticisms have more than a grain of truth to them. Nevertheless, they tend to extrapolate from the performance of certain Russian units to the whole force. Alongside their deficiencies, Russian forces have demonstrated that much of their equipment is effective, highly lethal and adaptable to a range of threats. While there are serious deficiencies in Russian capabilities, these are most pronounced in conducting offensive operations. Conversely, many of Russia’s combat support arms have not only demonstrated reasonable proficiency but have also shown that they are able to adapt to emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian forces have started to resolve a range of tactical challenges besetting their forces, it is noteworthy that many of these adaptations are reactive. The role specialisation of infantry has been driven by an inability to train enough troops, not by proactive force design. The acceleration and simplification of fire control has been driven by failing to deliver effective responsive fires early in the war. It thus remains unclear the extent to which these adaptations will become permanent aspects of the Russian military. It is also evident that as an institution the Russian military continues to fail to anticipate new threats. Air defence units, for example, show a growing proficiency against threats over time, but the introduction of any new strike system or tactics on the Ukrainian side usually causes a period of disruption and friendly fire. Most of all it is evident that the Russian military is systematically struggling to coordinate different functions; this can be exploited. The callousness of Russian approaches towards its own personnel continues to ensure that they underperform versus their potential, usually because of poor unit cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical capability underpinning the Russian military remains its fires. Here, it is less clear that its approach is sustainable, or that the pace of adaptation is sufficiently fast. Ultimately Russia has used its massive stockpile of ammunition in a highly inefficient manner and is exceeding its manufacturing rate as regards both shells and barrels. Firepower has been employed by the Russian military as a crutch to compensate for its tactical shortcomings in other areas. If the weight of salvo the Russian military can generate diminishes then it is not at all clear that Russia’s infantry can effectively hold ground. Perhaps the greatest danger for Ukraine, therefore, as regards the longer term trajectory of Russian forces, is if another country provides tooling and workers to establish additional production capacity in Russia for munitions and barrels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian troops, while superior in their morale and often in their training, continue to face a range of hard military tactical challenges in reclaiming their country’s territory. Overcoming these challenges requires sustained and appropriately targeted support from their international partners that reflects the evolution of the tactical situation. Overcoming Russian forces will also increasingly depend upon the tactical proficiency of Ukrainian training, force generation, and equipment maintenance, rather than on the introduction of additional systems. The complexity of Russian fortifications requires Ukraine to undertake a multifaceted process of shaping, breaching and exploitation demanding the preparation of its units and a range of complex capabilities. It is vital that Ukraine’s partners prioritise establishing a sustainable process for individual, collective and staff training to the AFU. Ukraine, today, has the initiative. But as the Russian military adapts, there can be no room for complacency.&lt;/p&gt;

As Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Arab states normalise their relations with Damascus and welcome the Syrian strongman to his first Arab League summit in 13 years, Syria is no longer the regional pariah it once was – to the West’s dismay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria, ravaged by a 12-year civil war and divided by a constellation of foreign forces, economic mismanagement, population displacement and political stalemate, has been pushed to the bottom of the international community’s agenda. The West, while strongly opposed to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad’s rehabilitation, has nonetheless become comfortable with the status-quo ante that has governed Syrian affairs since the collapse of the Islamic State’s territorial caliphate in 2019. Whereas the US was an early backer of the armed rebellion against Assad’s government, Washington now treats Syria as a counterterrorism problem. On 17 April, US special forces killed senior Islamic State leader Abd al-Hadi Mahmud al-Haji Ali during a helicopter raid in the northeast – just one of the dozens of counterterrorism operations the US has conducted in Syria this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria’s Arab neighbours, however, don’t have the luxury of ignoring what happens in the country or typecasting it as a security problem. In part due to the facts on the ground, the majority of the Arab world has slowly come to the realisation that perpetual isolation of the Syrian government is neither a wise nor a particularly effective policy. Even the Assad regime’s foremost opponents, most notably Saudi Arabia, have concluded that mending ties with Damascus – at least to an extent – holds a better chance of eliciting Assad’s cooperation on issues of mutual interest than a wholesale policy of pressure. The imperative to move in the direction of normalisation has only increased since the February earthquake in Turkey and northern Syria, which claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people. As Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan remarked during the Munich Security Conference shortly after the earthquake, “in the Arab world there is a consensus growing that the status quo is not workable”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-arab-world-moves-on-from-syrias-war&quot;&gt;The Arab World Moves on from Syria’s War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the Saudi foreign minister’s comments, Middle Eastern governments were busy exploring whether a détente with Syria was possible – not necessarily because they approved of Assad personally or believed he could be turned into a reliable partner, but because the years-long policy of using diplomatic isolation and economic pressure to coerce Damascus into political reforms had few if any accomplishments to show for it. The UAE re-opened its embassy in Damascus in December 2018 after a six-year hiatus, a move quickly followed up by Bahrain. Jordan, Syria’s neighbour to the south, re-opened a major border crossing in 2018 after Syrian government forces wrested back control of the southern city of Daraa (the cradle of the anti-Assad revolution); the crossing’s closure had had significant economic ramifications for Jordanian businesses based in the border city of al-Ramtha, reportedly resulting in over 80% of stores shutting their doors due to a steep drop in commerce. Iraq, which viewed the anti-Assad rebellion warily, ended restrictions at the crossing between the Iraqi city of Albu Kamel and the Syrian city of Al-Qaim in September 2019, despite external pressure on then-Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mehdi to keep the area shuttered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diplomatic movement between Syria and its Arab neighbours has been even more dramatic than the economic front. In October 2021, Jordan’s King Abdullah accepted a phone call from Assad for the first time since the civil war began a decade earlier. The call was significant less for its substance than for the fact that it occurred at all; Abdullah was one of the first Arab leaders to call for Assad’s resignation after the Syrian army was placed on a war-footing and began utilising tanks and aircraft against peaceful anti-government demonstrations. The UAE, which eyed the growth and consolidation of Iranian influence in Syria warily, made a concerted decision years earlier to reach out to Assad in the hopes of coaxing him away from Tehran. UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed flew to Damascus to meet with Assad in November 2021, the most senior Emirati official to do so at the time. Assad has visited the UAE twice since then, most recently in March 2023, when he held meetings with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed and was given state honours, which included Assad’s plane receiving an escort by Emirati fighter aircraft. The Egyptians, meanwhile, welcomed Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad to Cairo in April 2023, the first such trip since 2011 and yet another sign that regional players were becoming more interested in putting relations with Damascus on a less adversarial footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most consequential shift, however, involves Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest backers of the anti-Assad insurgency during the civil war’s deadliest years. No policy change moves quickly in Riyadh, but it appears as if Syria policy is an exception. In March 2023, the same month Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to resume diplomatic relations after a seven-year freeze, the Saudis announced that a similar effort was ongoing with the Syrian government. The bid was likely accelerated due to the February earthquake, which prompted Riyadh to dispatch planes carrying humanitarian assistance to Syrian government-controlled airports. Saudi Arabia and Syria arrived at an agreement in April to resume consular services in one another’s countries and to restore direct flights. To underscore the point, Syrian Foreign Minister Mekdad flew to Saudi Arabia on 12 April, the first trip by a Syrian official to the kingdom in more than a decade; Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal returned the favour with his own trip to Damascus six days later. On 9 May, Saudi Arabia and Syria officially confirmed the mutual re-opening of diplomatic facilities in one another’s countries; days earlier, the Arab League agreed by consensus to re-admit Syria after a suspension of nearly 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In part due to the facts on the ground, the majority of the Arab world has slowly come to the realisation that perpetual isolation of the Syrian government is neither a wise nor a particularly effective policy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons for the Arab world’s outreach to Syria vary depending on the specific country involved, although a healthy dose of realism can explain much of the momentum. There is a general recognition in the region that while Assad is a weak head of state governing a country split between US and Kurdish forces in the northeast, Turkish forces in the north and northwest and pro-Syrian militias at key border crossing points, he nevertheless controls most of Syria’s population centres, airports and highways and all of its ports. There is no notable opposition within the Syrian government to Assad’s continued rule, or at least not enough to warrant a threat to his position, and whatever political opposition that exists on the outside doesn’t have a strong constituency within the Syrian public at large. Assad retains strong military, economic and political support from his benefactors in Iran and Russia, and despite the Russian military’s formidable challenges in Ukraine, Assad’s state visit to Moscow in March suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin isn’t going to cut off that support anytime soon – saving Assad from being overthrown and solidifying the Syrian government’s position has been a significant Russian foreign policy achievement in the Middle East. Armed opposition to Assad still exists, but it’s limited to a jihadist faction hemmed into the north-western Syrian province of Idlib and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast, which have expressed a desire for their own talks with Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan and Saudi Arabia have even more of an incentive to end frosty relations with Damascus. Both countries are primary markets for the illegal captagon trade that is booming inside Syria. The Saudi and Jordanian security forces don’t have the capacity to tackle this scourge on their own and have concluded that the Syrian government needs to be brought in as a partner if they are to have any chance of stemming the drug’s flow. The fact that the Syrian security forces are directly involved in the production and distribution of captagon is either brushed aside or ignored. Assad has in effect created yet another regional problem that only he can solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-wests-view-of-the-syria-rapprochement&quot;&gt;The West’s View of the Syria Rapprochement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US, the UK and the EU remain staunchly opposed to any reconciliation with Assad, a man who has committed unspeakable acts during the course of Syria’s civil war, including but not limited to the use of chemical weapons in highly populated areas to quash the insurgency against his rule. The collective Western position is one of begrudging acceptance: while Assad will continue to serve as Syria’s president for a long time to come, it would be a fundamental mistake to reward him for shooting, bombing, gassing and starving his way to victory. In Washington, any hint of normalisation with a war criminal is a political non-starter, particularly in the US Congress, which was the principal force behind the comprehensive Caesar Act sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the latest regional developments, the Biden administration’s position hasn’t changed. The White House is adamant that while cross-border aid flows will continue in cooperation with the UN, diplomatic recognition and reconstruction assistance are off the table until Damascus satisfies a list of demands, most crucially UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which calls for a “Syrian-led political process” leading to the formation of a new constitution on the road to free and fair elections. The US Congress is even more hard-line than the White House; a bill mandating additional sanctions on the Syrian government and prohibiting any US funds from being used in a way that implies US normalisation of Assad’s government quickly cleared the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Even so, it’s highly unlikely that Biden administration officials and US lawmakers believe demands on political reform will ever be met. Given the facts on the ground and dwindling support for the Syrian opposition from even its traditional backers, Assad has no incentive to negotiate a political transition, which he sees as an unnecessary concession to Syrians he views unapologetically as traitors who deserve no reprieve, let alone a stake in the Syrian power structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Biden administration would prefer not to sanction partners like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE for investing in Syria or financing its reconstruction, but such sanctions may be inevitable given US law&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has largely followed the US lead on the Syria file. Indeed, the EU’s Syria policy is almost identical to Washington’s. “There will be no end to sanctions, no normalisations and no support for reconstruction until a political transition is underway”, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told the European Parliament in March 2021. This position was ratified again in January 2022 by the EU Foreign Affairs Committee. One year later, during a UN Security Council debate on Syria, the French delegation reiterated the EU’s general stance: “Any shift in French and European positions regarding the lifting of sanctions, normalisation and reconstruction is conditional upon the regime’s commitment to a credible and inclusive political process”. Upon learning of Syria’s re-entry into the Arab League, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly emphasised London’s disapproval of the move: “we cannot just wish away the actions of the Assad regime over the last few years; the brutality against Syrian people cannot just be ignored. And the UK certainly won’t brush that under the carpet”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-west-and-the-arab-world-at-a-crossroads&quot;&gt;The West and the Arab World at a Crossroads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to Syria policy, the West and its partners in the Middle East are increasingly singing from a different song sheet. The former wishes to preserve and build upon the economic sanctions regime that was established years ago, with the expectation that a lack of foreign investment and reconstruction assistance will over time compel Assad to seriously re-engage with the UN-facilitated dialogue process. The latter, with different priorities and interests at play, want to distance themselves from an approach that relegates Syria to the status of an international outcast until an unlikely democratic system emerges. This juxtaposition was on display during US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s 2 May call with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, in which he advised Cairo that “those engaging with the Assad regime should weigh carefully how those efforts are addressing the needs of the Syrian people”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught in the middle of the two poles are the Syrian people. More than 12 million, or 55 percent of Syria’s population, are food insecure. An astounding 90% of Syrians are living below the poverty line. More than 14 million have fled their homes since the outbreak of conflict in 2011 – nearly 7 million of whom remain internally displaced despite fighting between Syrian government and opposition forces plummeting since 2020, when Turkey and Russia backed a ceasefire in the Idlib region that largely froze the fighting. Estimates of Syria’s reconstruction costs vary but are usually pegged in the hundreds of billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing these differences will only become more difficult as the divergence in policy between the West and Syria’s Arab neighbours grows wider. The Biden administration would prefer not to sanction partners like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE for investing in Syria or financing its reconstruction, but such sanctions may be inevitable given US law. The Caesar Act states that the president “shall impose” financial penalties on any foreign person who “knowingly provides significant financial, material or technological support to, or knowingly engages in a significant transaction with” the Syrian government or an entity owned or controlled by it. The Syrian government’s extensive involvement in the Syrian economy means that any financial assistance would presumably incur repercussions from Washington. The US sanctions regime is likely to deter any large-scale foreign investment in Syria for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, investment from the Gulf states cannot be entirely excluded over the long term, particularly if economic activity is crucial to making diplomatic rapprochement with Damascus a success. In such a contingency, the West will have to determine if sanctions are appropriate – and if so, whether the costs of a breach with partners in the Gulf are worth the benefit of sticking to principle. Over time, the US and Europe could discover that maintaining a stringent sanctions regime on Syria in perpetuity, on behalf of wholly unrealistic goals, is an unsustainable or unnecessary obstacle in pursuit of its wider objectives in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

This report examines cybersecurity in Ukraine, with a look to the larger debate around cyber capabilities and defense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMES A. LEWIS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most networks can be breached, and most software has exploitable flaws. This can give unparalleled advantage to attackers, but the situation in Ukraine suggests that an energetic and thorough defense can prove more than adequate in matching this advantage. The Ukraine experience can guide decisions on cyber defense, and it suggests that adequate cyber defense will require different approaches, involve new actors, and be complex for nations to construct and coordinate. As part of the UK National Cyber Security Centre’s efforts to shape debate and discussion around cybersecurity issues, this collection of essays examines the war in Ukraine, with a view to the wider debate around the role and value of cyber capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “information space” is one of the key spaces in this conflict. Both sides have vied to shape public narratives and international opinion. Much has been written about the West’s use of the rapid declassification of strategic intelligence to counter and debunk Russian lies about actions in Ukraine. Similarly, much debate amongst academics and commentators has sought to understand whether or not the world is witnessing “cyber war” in Ukraine, or whether and how cyber operations add value to furthering a state’s strategic objectives. Originally, this discussion had a focus on cyber’s offensive utility. The following essays shift the focus toward the use of cyber capabilities for defensive or protective purposes and look at the Ukraine conflict through the lens of cyber defense to identify critical lessons from Ukraine on the construction of cyber resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serious thinking about cyber defense has largely transitioned from giving deterrence a central place in defensive strategies to focusing on the concept of resilience. Democracies cannot expect to deter adversaries from attempting to use cyber operations to advance their national objectives. This leads to the conclusion, discussed in all of the essays, that the goal for national policy must be cyber resilience: the ability to minimize disruption to critical data and services. Advocating for deterrence still serves a political purpose by signaling a desire to avoid conflict, but it is no longer the foundation of national cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of this is the new national cyber strategy published in March by the United States. The strategy never uses the word “deterrence” because, in the view of those responsible for its drafting, deterrence had failed routinely in cyberspace. Deterrence assumes that an adversary can be dissuaded from action; resilience assumes that adversary cyber action is inevitable. This has led to the conclusion that resilience is a better approach to cyber defense, particularly against a range of adversaries we confront, which includes not only states but also criminals and proxy forces. In this sense, cyber resilience protects against a much wider — and future — set of threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These essays explore different aspects of defense and resilience — including the actors that contribute to it — and identify lessons that Western countries can draw from the Ukrainian experience to build robust, collective cyber resilience. This includes the power of partnerships, whether in responding to cyberattacks or ensuring the continuation of vital services amidst conflict, and the unprecedented coalition of government, multinational, industry, and civil society actors whose efforts have enabled a stronger Ukrainian defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the most important aspect of resilience is only discussed indirectly in the essays: the need for political and social resilience. Lonergan, for example, notes that the political implications of cyber actions have proven to be more important than their military effect. One of Putin’s many miscalculations was the belief that Ukrainian defenses would quickly crumble. A Russian analyst (now in exile) suggests the precedent of Afghanistan as shaping Russian expectations, since in that case a well-equipped and Western-trained army evaporated in a matter of a few weeks. Putin may have expected Kyiv to react like Kabul. However, Ukraine’s leaders and people were not ready to concede to Russian suzerainty. The keystone of resilience is the political will to continue to resist. While it can be an elusive term, this political will forms the basis for diplomacy and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essays point out that the Ukraine conflict demonstrates that political resilience must be strengthened in cyberspace, by attention to both the digital technologies that create the information space messages and the content itself. This is not only because of the struggles over the narratives that shape opinion (and thus political will), nor solely because of the possibility of disrupting critical infrastructure, but also because cyber actions provide the tools and the structure to build a resilient community for defense — a community, as the authors note, that has transcended the boundaries of Ukraine and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more to cyber resilience than political will, of course (although without political will other actions are superfluous) — people, technology, organization, planning. Nor can cyber resilience be thought of as solely the remit of government. Indeed, what the Ukraine conflict has demonstrated is the broad, diverse range of actors participating in a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more diverse set of participants in the conflict raises questions of how it is that the roles and responsibilities within cyberspace are understood, as well as what the norms and rules are that dictate how actors conduct themselves. Ukraine has demonstrated the value of coalitions in cyberspace, and of collective defense, including robust and distributed data and network architectures. Partnerships with civil society, the private sector, and other governments are crucial. Organizing this multi-party effort requires an ability to connect and communicate with all actors, and this requires reinforcing established channels for media and official communications with the use of distributed and decentralized messaging services, like Signal and Telegram. All of the essays explore the new digital landscape where cyber conflict will occur and which nations must defend: a landscape created by fiber optic networks, mobile telephony, the “cloud,” and satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essays draw several lessons from the Ukrainian experience. The first is that many cyber strategies, in light of that experience, can now be seen to be incomplete or inadequate in their definitions of what is critical for defense. A second is the need to establish deep relations with allied and partner nations for sharing intelligence, technology, and tactics. Ukraine had an advantage in that its cyber conflict with Russia began in 2014, allowing government agencies to develop greater collaboration in responses and Ukraine to build mature relationships with allies. Similarly, establishing relations with global service providers and civil society on an ongoing basis is critical. The ability to use resources and support from the private sector and civil society gave Ukraine an advantage in defense that Russia was unable to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors recognize the need to exercise a degree of caution in drawing on the Ukrainian experience. Russia’s military proved to be startlingly incompetent; future opponents may not be similarly afflicted. Russia’s brutal and unprovoked invasion created a wave of sympathy and support among democracies and civil society. Other conflicts, where moral and ethical distinctions are not as stark, may not produce the same response. One task for national cyber agencies is to build now the supportive relationships with nongovernmental actors that are needed for conflict: both the constant ongoing low-level conflict that defines cyberspace and the eventuality of a conflict that crosses the threshold of the use of force, something that seems much closer than it did a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essays included in this collection predict that many different categories of actors will be enmeshed in future cyber conflict. This aspect of the Ukraine conflict provoked a confusing discussion in the broader cybersecurity literature on the legality of using proxies and the implications for the global norms on responsible state behavior in cyberspace that were agreed upon at the United Nations. Frankly, this debate seems to be based on misunderstanding. The UN discussions made it clear that the agreed norms do not apply during armed conflict — which is the sphere of different norms and laws, in particular the Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC). There are ambiguities, of course, created by the nature of cyberspace when nations attempt to apply LOAC, given that distinctions among participants and targets that can be clear in the physical world are opaque in cyberspace, but the authors discuss whether the use of proxies and militias has become a normal and (if done in accordance with LOAC) legal part of warfare and most likely an element of any cyber conflict in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essays raise these points in greater detail and clarity. Lonergan’s discussion of proxies makes the important point that while there is little evidence of effect from “hacktivism” on opponent decisionmaking or military capabilities, there is strong evidence that the primary effect is political and international — to build a community of support and to shape the narrative of the conflict for national and international audiences. The proxy actors’ apparent relationship with the “sponsoring” state is a key determinant of this, combined with a greater international orientation to shape the narratives of the conflict, and a focus solely on cyber effects may miss the most important impact created by proxies. Lonergan criticizes the tendency among policymakers and media to default to hyperbolic language to depict the effect of proxies, regardless of their true impact — noting that hyperbolic rhetoric about cyber proxies only reinforces their narratives and becomes a tool to rally their constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voo’s essay notes that the internet has become a political battleground and that Ukraine offers important strategic lessons for the key foundations of successful cyber defense. She asks fundamental questions of whether the responsibility for defense lies in the voluntary actions of tech companies or whether special rules for social media, dual-use technology, and the participation of volunteers are needed in periods of conflict. She emphasizes the need for organization and the importance of integrating cyber defense strategies into a country’s wider military and intelligence strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She and Ertan both note that private sector actions are not driven solely by altruism, since Russia’s cyber actions harm the space in which they do business, and there is only an ad hoc business model for private sector actions. Voo asks what has become the central question for international cybersecurity: whether consequences are needed for norms to have any meaning. Ertan suggests that countries may need to develop (individual or collective) funding mechanisms to remedy this with suggestions for remodeling cyber resilience from a NATO allies perspective. She also makes the critical point that “cyber war” is a flawed concept, since most adversary action remains below the use-of-force threshold. The increasing ease with which authoritarian states use cyberspace to undermine a rules-based order creates an uneasy space that is marked by conflict rather than peace. Garson also points to early misunderstandings of the complexity and limitations of cyber operations that confused expectations for the Ukraine war. She explores the sheer depth of the private sector’s involvement in cyberspace, along with the complexity this creates for companies as they seek to navigate engagement and risks within complex geopolitical crises — as well as the implications that the private sectors’ actions hold for long-term stability in cyberspace, as the lines between defensive and offensive activity become increasingly blurred in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These brief synopses do not do justice to the essays, and indeed barely touch upon many of their most salient points. There are also the caveats that the conflict has not ended and that the full details have not emerged. But with these caveats, the essays provide a deeper understanding of the use of cyber operations in the war — and how democratic countries should, in light of this, prepare their cyber defenses and resilience, whether within or outside of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-implications-of-cyber-proxies-in-the-ukraine-conflict&quot;&gt;The Implications of Cyber Proxies in the Ukraine Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ERICA D. LONERGAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-1&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to Russia’s invasion in February 2022, much of the expert commentary within the cyber community about the Ukraine conflict focused on three things: the extent to which Russia would launch a cyber “shock and awe” campaign to coerce Ukraine into submission; fears of a Russian cyber onslaught against the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe to deter Western intervention or retaliate against economic sanctions; and speculation about the degree to which Russia would effectively integrate cyber and kinetic operations on the modern battlefield. Yet, after more than one year of war, none of these issues has been a defining feature of the cyber dimension of the conflict in the way that most analysts expected. Instead, one of the most significant cyber features of the war has been the role of third-party actors as belligerents — cyber proxies — aligned to Russia or Ukraine. While the concept of cyber proxies is not novel, it has taken new and evolving characteristics in the context of the Ukraine conflict, offering a potential preview of how cyber proxies may play a role in future crises and conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, an important feature of cyber proxies in the Ukraine conflict is their willingness to conduct cyberattacks beyond the theater of operations, including against the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe. While policymakers issued warnings about potential Russian cyberattacks that might spill over beyond Ukraine, they did not necessarily anticipate the form in which they would ultimately occur — specifically, low-impact, disruptive cyber activity carried out by hacktivist groups. For instance, in late January 2022, the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) in the United Kingdom cautioned that Russia was likely to target the private sector via cyber means and advised companies to “bolster their cyber security resilience in response to the malicious cyber incidents in and around Ukraine.” And in February 2022, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a stark warning to private companies that Russia has “used cyber as a key component of [its] force projection over the last decade . . . The Russians understand that disabling or destroying critical infrastructure — including power and communications — can augment pressure on a country’s government, military, and population and accelerate their acceding to Russian objectives.” However, Russian advanced persistent threat actors have largely avoided conducting major, significant cyberattacks against Western targets. Instead, there has been a significant volume of disruptive cyber activity carried out by proxy actors with far more ambiguous relationships to the Russian government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of cyber proxy groups was immediately apparent in the opening days of the Ukraine conflict. For example, on February 24, 2022, the Anonymous hacker collective declared via its Twitter account that it was “currently involved in operations against the Russian Federation. Our operations are targeting the Russian government.” Shortly after that, Killnet, which was previously a modest hack-for-hire group, morphed into a politically motivated hacktivist entity and began a sustained effort to conduct low-cost, disruptive cyberattacks against a range of Western targets. Around the same time, the newly established IT Army of Ukraine, a volunteer hacker army that includes individuals from Ukraine and around the world, began to launch attacks against targets within the Russian Federation. In other words, the Ukraine conflict is characterized by a notable resurgence of proxy warfare — but with novel characteristics and permutations. Specifically, many of these cyber proxy groups are operating more as transnational social and political actors — creating platforms for political mobilization and influence — than as traditional proxies conducting cyber effects operations on behalf of a state government for the purposes of coercion or warfighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the reality that cyber proxies are a consistent feature — not an aberration — of this conflict, governments should anticipate that future wars may give rise to similar patterns. Yet, policymakers seem to be overlooking this aspect of the war, instead focusing more on dissecting the causes of Russia’s apparent underperformance in cyberspace or on emphasizing their own roles in contributing to Ukraine’s cyber defenses. However, because a significant portion of the cyber activity occurring in the context of this war is being perpetrated by different types of cyber proxy actors, it is important for policymakers to assess the implications of the novel ways in which cyber proxies are influencing the Ukraine conflict to better anticipate their roles in future contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;traditional-concepts-of-cyber-proxy-warfare&quot;&gt;Traditional Concepts of Cyber Proxy Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion of “proxy war” in cyberspace is not a new phenomenon. Indeed, governments have formed ambiguous, plausibly deniable relationships with a variety of cyber actors — both witting and unwitting — for as many decades as cyber conflict has existed. These actors range from criminal organizations at varying levels of sophistication (such as a ransomware groups); to patriotic hackers or hacktivists; to private firms; and to advanced persistent threat actors with closer, but still plausibly deniable, relationships with governments. Most discussions of cyber proxies focus on the different ways in which states direct (with varying degrees of overtness) or enable non-state actors to conduct cyber operations on behalf of or aligned with the interests of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has been an especially prolific actor in the cyber proxy realm, leveraging these groups not only for cyber effects operations but also for broader purposes of information and psychological warfare. This is not surprising given the Russian doctrine, which conceptualizes cyberspace and cyber warfare as only one element of a broader “information confrontation.” For example, Moscow has established longstanding relationships with cyber criminal organizations: providing them safe haven, protecting them from prosecution, and turning a blind eye to their criminal activities in exchange for their tacit agreement to avoid targeting Russian interests in cyberspace and to be available when called upon to act on behalf of the government. More recently, Russia has permitted ransomware groups to operate from its territory and conduct costly attacks against Western targets (even if it does not direct or order them to do so), including the spate of ransomware attacks in 2021 against U.S. firms such as Colonial Pipeline and JBS meat processing. Yet, Russia’s tolerance of cyber criminal groups is sometimes tested, such as its announcement in January 2022 that the Federal Security Service (FSB) had dismantled the ransomware group REvil, arresting some of its members and seizing its assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also leveraged both witting and unwitting cyber proxies to complement its military campaigns. As part of Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia, it is likely that the Russian government facilitated the creation of online forums to distribute malware and coordinate cyberattacks against Georgian targets. Cyber proxy groups were also prolific in the context of Russia’s 2014 annexation and occupation of Crimea. For example, in October 2014 the hacktivist group CyberBerkut, which experts suspect has connections to APT28 (the Russian advanced persistent threat actor linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence), compromised Ukraine’s election systems and posted exfiltrated data online just prior to the parliamentary elections. And in 2015, APT28 carried out the first-known cyberattack against a state’s power grid, disrupting Ukraine’s grid for several hours during the winter. It is likewise notable that Ukrainian patriotic hacker groups were also active during Russia’s 2014 military campaign — such as the Ukrainian Cyber Army, which conducted website defacements and similar types of low-impact attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, states have found working with cyber proxy groups appealing for a range of reasons. The ambiguous and secretive nature of these relationships enables governments to plausibly deny their role in cyber incidents, shielding themselves from potential retaliation by adversaries or from paying political costs in the context of their own domestic politics. In some cases, a government may see benefits in tacitly permitting proxy groups to engage in more aggressive, disruptive, or offensive actions than it would otherwise be willing to conduct directly, or it may permit them to attack certain types of targets that the government might otherwise see as being off limits for its own cyber forces, such as civilian critical infrastructure. Encouraging action by cyber proxy groups can also serve as a means of diverting domestic political or nationalist pressure during international crises, acting as a form of pressure release. Permitting cyber proxies can also keep potential threats to a regime busy: rather than applying their cyber skills against the government, would-be hackers can be directed against both internal rivals and external threats to a regime. Additionally, particularly for less mature cyber powers, proxy groups can provide a much-needed augmentation of a state’s cyber capabilities or skilled personnel. In some cases, highly organized cyber criminal enterprises may be more sophisticated than some nation-state actors. From the perspective of the cyber proxy group, implicit or explicit state support provides a number of benefits. Most importantly, the legal protections offered by states can shield proxy groups from prosecution or even extradition by international law enforcement, enabling groups to carry out their enterprises without scrutiny. Cyber proxies may also perceive gains from resources, technologies, training, and capabilities to which they might otherwise lack access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, there are also risks. In particular, with respect to the state, cyber proxy groups could exceed their mandate, creating risks of blowback or retaliation against the government or increasing the chances of inadvertent escalation. In a different vein, cyber proxies may simply be ineffective, shirk responsibilities, or divert government resources toward their own desired objectives. Finally, cyber proxies could turn against their state sponsor, engaging in cyber activities that directly or indirectly undermine the sponsor’s interests or political stability. Therefore, a core aspect of cyber proxy warfare hinges on the nature of the relationship between the proxy group and the state sponsor. The extent to which a state has effective command and control over the activates of a proxy group — directing it to conduct cyber operations in its interests — or whether it risks both under- and over-performance by a proxy shapes the benefits and risks of working with cyber proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;traditional-forms-of-cyber-proxy-behavior-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Traditional Forms of Cyber Proxy Behavior in Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 Ukraine conflict has seen a significant amount of this type of traditional cyber proxy behavior — where a state implicitly permits or more directly urges affiliated non-state actors to conduct cyberattacks. In this sense, the current conflict reflects a level of continuity with Russia’s past approaches. One example of traditional cyber proxy warfare is the failed attempt by APT28 on April 8, 2022, to replicate its 2015 success in disrupting Ukraine’s power grid. While ultimately unsuccessful (Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team and a Slovakian cybersecurity firm were able to halt the attack), it appears to have been an effort by Russia to apply cyber power as part of a broader warfighting approach via leveraging traditional proxy groups. Indeed, evidence indicates that the attackers had gained access to the power grid’s system in the first phases of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has also been characterized by the activation of Russian-aligned hacktivist groups with more ambiguous relationships with Moscow that are likely under much looser command and control structures — similar to Russia’s mobilization of these groups in 2008 in Georgia and 2014 in Crimea. Indeed, many of these groups claim to have no formal affiliation with the Russian government, even as they operate in Russia’s interests. Specifically, these Russian-aligned hacktivist groups have been active in attacking targets of interest within Ukraine, including critical infrastructure, even if the sophistication and severity of their attacks has been minimal. For example, on August 15, 2022, the People’s CyberArmy conducted a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a Ukrainian state-owned nuclear power company, Energoatom. The hacktivist group unleashed 7.25 million bot accounts, which flooded the power company’s website with bogus traffic. Nevertheless, Energoatom was able to thwart the DDoS attack within a few hours, and the People’s CyberArmy quickly moved on to other Ukrainian targets. In another illustrative example, on July 1, 2022, XakNet, a Russian-aligned hacktivist group, claimed that it had conducted a cyberattack against DTEK, Ukraine’s largest energy holding company, posting to its Telegram channel screenshots that were meant to serve as proof of its successful breach of the company’s networks. This cyber incident occurred at the same time as Russian missile attacks against DTEK’s Kryvorizka thermal power plant in Kryvyi Rih, although the connection between the cyber and kinetic incidents is likely spurious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-forms-of-cyber-proxy-warfare&quot;&gt;New Forms of Cyber Proxy Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Ukraine conflict is revealing new permutations of cyber proxy warfare that are more internationalized, just as the broader conventional conflict itself has drawn in multiple external participants. Specifically, a significant portion of the cyber activity that is taking place in the political context of the Ukraine conflict is being carried out by hacktivist groups that are attacking targets beyond the theater of operations — either within the Russian homeland or against targets in the West, especially the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) member states. Moreover, these groups are drawing on participants from around the world who are aligned to their political orientation, even if they may lack the level of skill and sophistication of other threat actors, such as APT28, that are more directly aligned with governments. Examining just two different examples of these types of cyber proxy actors — Killnet and the Ukraine IT Army — reveals some of the similarities as well as the variation across these groups and how they are changing the nature of cyber proxy warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, while these two groups express diametrically opposed political orientations and differ in the extent of their affiliation with a government (the Ukraine IT Army was initially created by a government official, while Killnet claims to be independent of Moscow), they are primarily focused on conducting disruptive or nuisance cyber campaigns against targets beyond the battlefield in Ukraine. Additionally, both cyber proxy groups maintain active social media forums where they provide direction to their members about planning and executing cyberattacks. But these forums also serve to communicate political messages and act as a form of virtual political mobilization, rallying cadre around a cause and shaping the narrative of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this combination of more internationally-oriented membership and targeting, coupled with the use of cyberattacks as a vehicle for political mobilization, that makes this form of cyber proxy warfare particularly interesting and novel in a warfighting context. In this sense, these cyber proxies act as both transnational and local actors — conducting operations beyond the battlefield as a means of cultivating their own internal political narratives, while at the same time shaping broader narratives about the conflict. In other words, these groups are playing a role in the Ukraine war not simply by virtue of how their cyber effects operations are impacting the course of the conflict, or through deterring or coercing external parties. After all, the types of operations these groups conduct are low-cost, disruptive cyberattacks that do not do much in the way of damage. Rather, their cyber campaigns are a way for groups to further political narratives about the war and shape the perceptions of different audiences, and it is through this lens — not that of cyber effects — that their impact can be best understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;killnet&quot;&gt;Killnet&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Killnet, a Russian-aligned hacktivist group that became active in the initial stages of the conflict, is a formerly small and obscure botnet for hire organization that has since rebranded as an internationally known hacktivist group. Politico has described the group as “more like an angry, nationalist online mob armed with low-grade cyber-offensive tools and tactics,” contrasting it with more sophisticated Russian threat actors. Indeed, Killnet’s adherents are not particularly skilled and the group almost exclusively conducts straightforward DDoS campaigns, publishing simple scripts on its social media channels for followers to use. Yet, Killnet has received a significant amount of attention from analysts and the media due to its near-routine targeting of Western entities, including critical infrastructure. This distinguishes Killnet from other pro-Russia hacktivist groups, which have largely focused on targets within Ukraine, perhaps in coordination or at least alignment with Russian conventional military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in early February 2023, Killnet launched a wave of DDoS attacks against more than a dozen hospitals in the United States. But, like many of Killnet’s prior disruptive attacks, the actual impact on U.S. hospitals was minimal. According to Cloudfare, the largest of these attacks peaked for only ten seconds, with the total attack lasting for only six minutes. Similarly, the American Hospital Association stated that the “impact appears to have been minimal and temporary.” This cyber activity is a hallmark of Killnet’s approach: conducting low-impact disruptive cyber campaigns against Western critical infrastructure and other targets. In these types of campaigns, Killnet does not appear to be focused on actually having an impact with its disruptive attacks — or at least does not particularly care if its self-generated bravado matches reality. Despite the negligible effects of its cyber operations, Killnet appears to relish in hyperbolic and triumphalist language to rally supporters around its cyber campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against smaller countries, particularly the Baltic states, Killnet has been more successful in sustaining disruptive attacks over longer periods of time. For example, in May 2022 as part of its declaration of “war” against countries supporting Ukraine, Killnet launched DDoS attacks against dozens of targets in Latvia, a NATO member state, ranging from government and transportation to finance. Accompanying these attacks were calls on Killnet’s Telegram channel and other social media sites for cadre to carry out additional cyberattacks against Latvia. Killnet targeted Latvia again in July with a large disruptive attack — including a 12-hour disruption of Latvia’s public broadcasting center — after the government stated it would take down Soviet-era monuments. August saw another disruptive attack, this time against the website of Latvia’s parliament after the body declared Russia to be a state sponsor of terrorism. All this followed a 10-day wave of DDoS attacks against Lithuania in June in response to that government’s decision to block certain Russian exports. Moreover, these represent only a handful examples of the disruptive attacks conducted by Killnet and similar groups against Latvia and Lithuania which, along with Estonia, are routinely targeted in this manner by cyber proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the bluster may be the point. Specifically, an important aspect of Killnet’s success as an organization derives from its Telegram channel and associated media sites, where members routinely congratulate one another and even leverage Western media reports about their cyberattacks to bolster their credibility internally and improve morale within the group. Killnet’s Telegram channel, which is only in Russian, has over 90 thousand subscribers. Indeed, as Dark Reading reported, Killnet has seen a significant increase in its social media followers stemming from the public nature of its DDoS campaigns (even as they are not causing any meaningful effects): “Killnet’s’ pro-Russian DDoS crusade has also begun attracting many more followers and fans.” Killnet has even become a feature of Russian war-related pop culture. Last summer, Russian rapper Kazhe Oboyma published a song glorifying Killnet called “KillnetFlow (Anonymous diss).” In October 2022, Killnet launched a jewelry collaboration with Russian jeweler HooliganZ, and the group also sells other Killnet-branded merchandise. This “serves as a form of propaganda, helping to recruit new members and promote the group’s cause.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other Russian-aligned hacktivist groups, Killnet’s leader, Killmilk, staunchly disavows any formal relationship with the Russian government and claims that the group is entirely self-organized and sustaining. Yet, it is clear that Killnet is serving Russia’s broader political purposes in the conflict. The fact that Killnet’s Telegram channel is only published in Russian, for instance (coupled with its attempts to gain a foothold in broader Russian culture), provides insights into the audience the group is interested in mobilizing — domestic Russian or near-abroad Russian speaking audiences. In this sense, Killnet is ostensibly a useful tool of Moscow’s efforts to maintain domestic support around continuing Russian military involvement in Ukraine — while at the same time keeping potential spoilers and discontented would-be cyber actors busy. This aligns with recent research on the use of cyber proxies during international crises, where states have been found to use these actors as a means of placating certain domestic political audiences. While that research was focused on the role these groups play in facilitating the de-escalation of crises, it reflects an important insight that there are domestic political considerations in the use of cyber proxy groups that may be as significant to a government, if not more so, than international ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-it-army-of-ukraine&quot;&gt;The IT Army of Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Killnet and the IT Army of Ukraine are on opposite political sides of the conflict and engage vastly different audiences, there are several important similarities between the two groups. This is suggestive of emerging trends in cyber proxy warfare stemming from the Ukraine conflict. Both the IT Army of Ukraine and Killnet have transnational characteristics in terms of the international representation of their volunteers and the scope of their targeting. Specifically, both groups focus their efforts on attacking targets — such as civilian critical infrastructure — outside of the theater of operations in Ukraine. While Killnet largely conducts DDoS attacks against the West, the IT Army of Ukraine has directed its efforts almost exclusively against Russian targets within the Russian Federation (rather than on the battlefield), as well against Belarus. Additionally, both Killnet and the IT Army prefer low-cost, disruptive cyberattacks, likely because this enables wider participation by would-be volunteers, making it easier for sympathetic individuals to join the cause. Finally, both groups leverage social media platforms (albeit in different ways) as part of their efforts to facilitate political mobilization and shape the information narratives around the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, there are also key differences between the groups. One important distinction is the nature of each group’s relationship with government — a core element of cyber proxy warfare. While it is clear that the Russian government benefits from Killnet’s activities, there is no evidence of a formal link between the two. In contrast, while the Ukrainian government has publicly denied any role in the IT Army’s activities, the group was initially created in February 2022 by Ukraine’s deputy prime minister and minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, reportedly at the suggestion of Yegor Aushev, a Ukrainian tech entrepreneur. Moreover, in March 2023, the Ukrainian government announced that it is in the process of developing legislation to formalize the IT Army and incorporate it into the country’s regular armed forces. Additionally, there is far less plausible deniability in the relationship between Kyiv and the IT Army. As Newsweek depicts it, the Ukrainian government “is the first country, certainly the first European democracy, to openly embrace a hacktivist militia during a shooting war.” Similarly, Wired describes the IT Army as “a government-led volunteer unit that’s designed to operate in the middle of a fast-moving war zone.” That said, it is important to note that the idea of a decentralized volunteer cyber citizen militia is not an entirely novel concept in Europe, with the exemplar being the Estonian Defence League’s Cyber Unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, while IT Army maintains that it operates independently of the Ukrainian government (at least until the new legislation is passed), researchers have suggested that the organization is actually segmented into two distinct groups. The first is a large, public-facing, globally engaged network of volunteers who conduct disruptive cyber operations against Russian targets. Notably, however, the size of its membership has been declining over time, estimated to be nearly 300,000 subscribers in February 2022 to just under 200,000 in March 2023. The second element of the IT Army is an “in-house team likely consisting of Ukrainian defense and intelligence personnel that have been experimenting with and conducting ever-more complex cyber operations against specific Russian targets.” This latter component, therefore, embodies a traditional concept of cyber proxy warfare (characterized by plausibly deniable connections between military and intelligence organizations and cyber actors), while the former resembles newer permutations of cyber proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the IT Army of Ukraine is far more disciplined than Killnet in terms of its organization and approach, professing to be deliberate in its targeting decisionmaking. For example, in response to a query from a Newsweek reporter, an IT Army spokesperson noted that the group is “focused on causing economic damage to Russia in order to weaken its ability to wage war against Ukraine . . . We do not target ordinary citizens, and we take great care to adhere to the laws of armed conflict.” The group has developed mechanisms for organizing and prioritizing different types of targets, identifying the anticipated level of skill that a given attack demands, and coordinating and deconflicting among different efforts. Its Telegram channel also maintains a routinized tasking process for disruptive attacks, where marching orders are given at the same time each day (0900 Central European Time) and targets are typically organized by a theme (such as food delivery services on a weekend to make everyday life slightly more difficult for Russian citizens — suggesting the IT Army may indeed sometimes target ordinary civilians). Despite this level of organization — ostensibly more so than Killnet — there is little evidence that the IT Army’s disruptive cyberattacks are having any meaningful impact on the Russian government’s decisionmaking or on the Russian population’s support for the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that, like Killnet, the cyberattacks themselves (and, by extension, their effects) do not represent the primary contribution of the IT Army to the broader conflict. Instead, the IT Army of Ukraine has leveraged social media to create both a local (Ukrainian) and international (largely Western) community of supporters aligned with its cause. The act of collectively conducting relatively simple cyberattacks thus builds and reinforces community, providing something around which to rally and energize supporters. How these two groups use their social media platforms is also suggestive of the different audiences they are aiming to mobilize. Killnet’s Telegram page is focused on shaping the perceptions of Russian-speaking audiences. In contrast, the IT Army’s Telegram page is in both Ukrainian and English, which reflects the Western-oriented audience the group aims to engage. Indeed, while the group’s first Telegram post on February 26, 2022, was in Ukrainian, the second was in English and contained the following message: “For all IT specialists from other countries, we translated tasks in English. Task # 1 We encourage you to use any vectors of cyber and DDoS attacks on these resources.” What followed was a list of Russian targets organized by sector, from “business corporations” like Gazprom and Lukoil, to “banks” such as Sberbank, and to “the state” including the Office of the President, the Ministry of Defense, and others. In this sense, the IT Army of Ukraine is a microcosm of Ukraine’s broader effort to shape the information environment within Ukraine and — importantly — among Western audiences, whose political support is essential for enabling military support to the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-implications&quot;&gt;Policy Implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several policy implications follow from this analysis. One clear finding is that future crises and conflict are almost certain to involve a range of cyber proxy actors that are diverse in terms of their level of skill, connection to a central government, and willingness to engage different types of targets. Some of the cyber proxies aligned to the Russian government have conducted (or attempted to conduct) more sophisticated attacks against key targets in Ukraine; others have engaged in low-cost attacks within Ukraine; and still others have conducted disruptive attacks beyond the theater against Western targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have argued that the proliferation of cyber proxy behavior in the context of the Ukraine conflict has negative implications for international norms about state sponsorship of cyber proxy groups. Western states have sought to promote a norm that states should be held accountable for any cyberattacks that they enable or permit by failing to restrain or turning a blind eye toward proxy groups that emanate from their sovereign borders. Moreover, in the March 2021 final report of the United Nations Open Ended Working Group, nearly all states have agreed to uphold norms of responsible behavior, including norms around preventing the misuse of information and communications technologies. As a result, some have argued that Ukraine’s public support for cyber proxy groups conducting attacks against Russia (such as the IT Army of Ukraine) “stands in stark violation of recently agreed-to norms on state behavior in cyberspace, as well as the foreign policy positions of NATO members and the European Union.” Yet a key challenge with this line of reasoning, as others have pointed out, is that armed conflict represents a fundamentally different context than peacetime or even times of international crisis — one in which “cyber norms should be expected to fall by the wayside before or along with the transition from IHRL [International Human Rights Law] to LOAC [Law of Armed Conflict].” Therefore, policymakers should exercise discretion when considering the normative implications of this conflict and avoid muddying the waters between cyber behavior during wartime versus during routine competition — especially because this may inadvertently undermine important efforts to establish cyber norms where they are actually applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, policymakers should not apply a one-size-fits-all approach to these different actors. Traditional policy tools — such as placing diplomatic pressure against state sponsors of cyber proxy groups (like Biden’s warning to Putin in June 2021 at the Geneva summit against permitting groups to conduct cyberattacks against U.S. critical infrastructure) coupled with law enforcement action and disruptive campaigns, may be more effective in addressing traditional cyber proxy actors, especially those over whom a state has more effective command and control. These approaches (likely together with credible threats of retaliation, such as repeated public affirmation that NATO’s Article 5 applies to the cyber domain) appear to have worked in dissuading Russia from directly ordering or enabling more advanced threat actors from conducting major cyberattacks against NATO member states. While speculative, it is plausible that Russia’s decision to dismantle the ransomware group REvil in January 2022 — just one month prior to the invasion — was in part meant as a signal to other groups of Russian control, perhaps to deter them from taking unwanted cyber action or to nudge them fall in line with Moscow’s goals. One potential example of this is the February 25 statement by the Conti ransomware group on its Dark Web site that it was “officially announcing a full support of Russian government” and would respond to any “war activities against Russia.” This is notable because, previously, Conti was not a politically motivated actor and was instead decidedly focused on cyber crime for financial gain. Indeed, the group’s decision to become political caused an internal rift and likely motivated a significant leak of internal documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is unlikely that these traditional tools will be as effective against groups such as Killnet that have a more indirect relationship with central government and that draw on a more international base of support. These groups are likely to be less dependent on the safe haven provided by a government (especially because their lack of sophisticated infrastructure, reliance on open-source tools, and global membership make them relatively easy and low-cost to dis- and reassemble). This means that applying traditional levers to shape the behavior of these groups through putting pressure on state sponsors is a fruitless endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the impact new cyber proxy actors are having on the Ukraine conflict — more in terms of shaping political mobilization and cultivating or reinforcing narratives about the war, and less in terms of the actual effects of their cyber operations — complicates how policymakers are typically inclined to address these groups. In some ways, from a policy perspective, it is more straightforward to focus on thwarting, mitigating, or improving resilience against cyber effects operations than it is to counter political narratives or offer credible competing ones. Yet how these cyber proxies are shaping the conflict is more akin to political warfare than coercion. This relates to a broader challenge Western policymakers are facing in the context of the Ukraine war — namely, that while advanced liberal democracies are largely united and have remained more cohesive than expected in pushing back against Russian aggression, a significant part of the world is either Russian-sympathetic (such as China) or non-aligned (such as India). Of course, cyber proxy groups like Killnet and the IT Army of Ukraine are only one element of the broader contest to shape the perceptions of different audiences. Nevertheless, in evaluating the impact of these groups (and, by extension, applying policies to address them) through the lens of “hackers for hire,” policymakers are missing their real role in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is a tendency among policymakers and media to default to hyperbolic language when depicting the workings of various cyber threat actor groups, regardless of their true stature. But blustery rhetoric about these cyber proxy groups only plays into their narrative, which groups in turn use as a tool to further rally their constituencies. Therefore, policymakers should take care to avoid inadvertently playing into groups’ political narratives and providing fodder that enables them to increase their own visibility within their audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the recent announcement that the IT Army of Ukraine may be absorbed into Ukraine’s armed forces suggests broader implications for cyber defense and resilience. The head of Ukraine’s National Coordination Center for Cybersecurity, Nataliya Tkachuk, shared with Newsweek that the government was motivated to formalize the IT Army so that the group would, “become the basis for building the state’s cyber defense capabilities, engaging cyber volunteers in these activities, and creating a cyber reserve.” The IT Army appears to support this effort, commenting that, “We fully trust the efforts of the working group to legalize a massive fight in the cyber sector and welcome the moment when it will stop being the grey zone. We . . . believe that the integration of the IT Army into the cyber reserve will help in building a more effective defense against cyber threats.” This transition is likely unprecedented. There are no known examples of an informal hacktivist group becoming incorporated into a state’s regular armed forces. However, other states have employed volunteer models for cyber defense. Estonia, for example, has pioneered one approach to leveraging volunteer cyber defenders through its Estonian Cyber Defence League — which itself was created in response to Russia’s cyberattacks against the country in 2007. One key issue for Ukraine is how a force that had previously been conducting a largely offensive mission will be able to shift to one focused on defense, both in terms of skills and commitment to a different type of mission. The level of expertise required to carry out low-cost disruptive attacks against Russian-aligned targets is different from that which is necessary to defend domestic networks and systems. Another important question is which elements of the IT Army will transition into regular forces, particularly given the group’s current international composition — as well as the extent to which the government will be able to control the activities of those elements of the IT Army that do not get subsumed under traditional command structures and prevent them from going rogue. Western policymakers should closely follow how this process unfolds in Ukraine, as it could offer important lessons for how governments could better integrate and leverage their own civilian cyber talent to improve cyber defense and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-from-ukraines-cyber-defense-and-implications-for-future-conflict&quot;&gt;Lessons from Ukraine’s Cyber Defense and Implications for Future Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JULIA VOO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-2&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a hundred countries reportedly possess the capability to launch state-sponsored cyberattacks. The Russia-Ukraine conflict presents a case study of two capable cyber powers applying their capabilities to achieve national objectives in direct opposition to one another over a sustained period. This conflict has illuminated an eight-year cyber struggle that escalated to include kinetic components last year. With conflicts between states now frequently unfolding in the ambiguous space between peace and war, many national governments should examine Ukraine’s cyber defense as a learning opportunity. Reorganizing to better defend against cyber threats and maximizing capabilities in cyberspace was already a priority for numerous governments before this conflict. While two-thirds of governments worldwide have introduced strategies to defend against threats in cyberspace, more comprehensive measures are needed. The effectiveness of Ukraine’s defense, combined with the high number of countries capable of launching offensive cyber operations, highlights the necessity for the proper structures and relationships to approach cyber defense holistically and effectively. This cyber conflict is notable for how Ukraine — with support from national governments, civil society, and the private sector — conducted a strong cyber defense against a top-tier cyber power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that 2023 will see Russia escalating its cyberattacks against Ukraine, and perhaps NATO partners, to further its objectives. While it is challenging to generalize the lessons from Ukraine’s cyber defense so far, there are several key takeaways that other states should derive from the past year as they face cyberattacks from not only Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-ukraine-conflict-and-the-value-of-cyber-defense&quot;&gt;Russia-Ukraine Conflict and the Value of Cyber Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the world had not witnessed a kinetic conflict between two highly capable cyber powers. Contrary to the anticipated crushing defeat many expected Russia to deliver to Ukraine due to Russia’s extensive record as a capable offensive cyber actor, Ukraine has managed to successfully defend its interests while demonstrating the role of cyber capabilities in conventional conflict. Ukraine had been encouraged for years to build its cyber defenses and implement a “whole-of-society” cyber defense. As a result, the lessons from this conflict are challenging to generalize given their specific context, including a pre-existing gray zone conflict and unprecedented resources from international actors and the private sector. Nonetheless, Ukraine’s cyber defense thus far merits reflection by other national governments looking to strengthen their own moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERIENCED CYBER DEFENDERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia officially crossed into Ukrainian territory on February 24, 2022, Ukraine has been defending itself from Russian cyberattacks since Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, with attacks escalating ahead of the invasion. Over the past decade, Ukraine’s public, energy, media, financial, business, and nonprofit sectors repeatedly suffered from Russian attacks. In 2015, Russia shut off part of Ukraine’s electricity grid, leaving 230,000 people without power for six hours. In 2017, NotPetya malware deployed by the GRU (Russian military intelligence) targeted hundreds of firms and hospitals worldwide, including Ukraine’s power grid. Russia’s cyber operations since the beginning of the kinetic conflict have ranged from preventing access to basic services to data theft, disinformation, wiper malware, DDoS attacks, phishing emails, and surveillance software. Despite these challenges, Ukraine has managed to marshal its capabilities, resources, and relationships to block and recover from setback after setback in cyberspace. A crucial component of cyber defense is investment in both financial resources and human capital to ensure the recruitment and retention of skilled cybersecurity professionals. The maturity of Ukraine’s security operations and incident response, along with its battle-hardened cyber defenders, is difficult to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOLISTIC NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than two-thirds of countries now have some form of cybersecurity strategy to guide their overall cyber defense. A notable step in Ukraine’s consolidation of its national cyber capabilities was the adoption of its 2016 National Cybersecurity Strategy, which recognized the importance of all stakeholders in strengthening Ukraine’s cyber defense, both inside and outside of government. National governments can increase their cyber resilience in several ways: by introducing laws and regulations on cybercrime and cybersecurity; by implementing technical measures to ensure that expertise is available to enhance cyber resilience; by establishing organizational measures to ensure coordination between government agencies and relevant actors; and by developing capacity through the growth of domestic cybersecurity industries, investments in R&amp;amp;D programs, and skills development. The Ukrainian government sought to enhance collaboration among all government agencies, local authorities, military units, law enforcement, research institutions, and civil society to improve Ukraine’s overall cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective cyber defense strategies are integrated into a country’s wider national strategies, including military operations and intelligence gathering. Furthermore, cyber strategies must be continuously updated and adapted to keep up with evolving threats and increase national resilience. Through the experience of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, there were key expansions to Ukraine’s 2021 strategy that involved “a wider range of participants, including business entities, public associations, and individual citizens of Ukraine” in addressing Ukraine’s national cybersecurity system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CENTRALIZATION OF GOVERNMENT CYBER DEFENSES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, national governments are streamlining the various departments responsible for different aspects of cyber operations. There are clear roles within governments for structures such as intelligence agencies, the military, law enforcement, and the foreign service; but for cyber defense, these often separate components need to work in tandem. The 2016 Ukrainian cyber strategy also led to the creation of the National Cybersecurity Coordination Center (NCCC). The NCCC, which brings together aspects of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, supervises and analyzes the state of national cybersecurity, including preparedness for combating cyber threats and detecting and forecasting potential and actual threats. The NCCC also hosts international and interdepartmental training courses. Ukraine’s effective centralization and coordination of its governmental cyber defenses demonstrate that these capabilities need to work seamlessly together to ensure maximum effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALLIES SHARING INTEL AND TECH BEFORE AND DURING CONFLICT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the game-changing aspects of Ukraine’s cyber defense is the international support it received and continues to receive. This support has come in the form of cyber expertise and intelligence from other governments, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as governmental organizations like the European Union and the NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International cyber partnerships and support for Ukraine started well before the February invasion. Since 2014, international partners, including the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, have mobilized resources to enhance Ukraine’s cyber defenses while also boosting their own. The United States and Ukraine hosted the first bilateral cyber dialogue in 2017, which included participants sharing approaches on organizing cybersecurity structures and cyber incident response procedures. Since then, the United States has provided $40 million in cyber capacity development assistance to Ukraine. In 2021, the European Union launched a cyber dialogue with Ukraine to strengthen its resilience and legislation in the area of cybersecurity. In the months leading up to the invasion, cyber experts from U.S. Cyber Command and Ukrainian Cyber Command conducted defensive cyber operations side by side to increase cyber resilience in critical networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies have continued to strengthen Ukraine’s cyber defense since the beginning of the invasion. For example, the United States and the United Kingdom have provided intelligence briefings on Russian cyber operations, including cyber threat intelligence on potential and ongoing malicious attacks such as Industroyer2 malware, firewalls for defense, and DDoS protection. The U.S. government has also assisted Ukraine with identifying and procuring hardware and software to support network defense. Notably, since the beginning of the conflict, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has supplied technical experts to support essential service providers and offered 6,750 emergency communication devices, including satellite phones and data terminals, to strengthen the resilience of critical infrastructure networks and the government. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the European Union deployed a cyber rapid response team to help with threat detection and mitigation and has provided €29 million (roughly $31 million) to increase Ukraine’s cyber and digital resistance. Germany has also earmarked some of its 2023 budget to defend Ukraine against Russian cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the full extent of Russia’s cyber operations against Ukraine and NATO allies has not been made public due to the secrecy surrounding respective vulnerabilities, information sharing between Ukraine and its allies has been two-way. Senior Ukrainian cyber defenders have also met bilaterally with national governments to learn from each other as the conflict continues. Allies who have sent reinforcements in the form of personnel are in turn provided with expertise to better defend their own national networks against similar attacks. This two-way learning is set to continue, with Ukraine becoming an active participant in NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence in March 2022, which, through knowledge sharing, will result in a strengthening of expertise for the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRE-EXISTING PRIVATE SECTOR CYBER DEFENDERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine war has involved not only conventional military forces and proxies but also, most notably for Ukraine, technology companies. This is unsurprising, as most of the digital infrastructure in Ukraine is owned and operated by private companies. Moreover, it has long been recognized that a strong partnership between the government and the private sector is needed for robust cyber defenses. The cumulative power of the private sector has enhanced Ukraine’s defensive capabilities, including its ability to recover from attacks, improve its battlefield effectiveness, and enhance its global appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collaboration between the private sector and Ukraine demonstrates an unprecedented case of what is possible when there is an alignment of interests between a country at war and commercial technology companies with significant resources at their disposal and an interest in one side’s victory. It remains unclear whether this is a one-off case or a harbinger for future conflicts, but the implications for policymakers are considerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, Microsoft played a critical role in defending Ukraine against Russian cyberattacks, although it was not the only company to do so by far. In early 2022, Microsoft identified a novel trojan horse wiper malware named FoxBlade, which was aimed at Ukraine’s government ministries and financial institutions. After updating its virus detection systems to block the malicious code, Microsoft contacted Anne Neuberger, the U.S. deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, and established a secure line of communication with cyber officials to help bolster Ukrainian defenses. Since then, Microsoft and others have continued to work with the U.S. government, NATO, and EU cyber officials to communicate any evidence of threat actor activity spreading beyond Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has been a significant contributor to Ukraine’s and the wider community’s cyber defense, it is only one of many private sector companies that came to Ukraine’s aid. An important part of the private sector’s contribution to Ukraine is not only the considerable resources received from specific entities but also the collaboration between them to jointly provide Ukraine’s cyber defense. A collective of private sector and civil society organizations has volunteered to deliver and maintain Ukraine’s immediate cyber defense needs since the beginning of Russia’s invasion, forming a “Cyber Defense Assistance Collaborative for Ukraine” (CDACU). This informal group of volunteers leveraged relationships with Ukraine’s NCCC, building on pre-existing trust and rapport, to understand how the private sector could help. The CDACU received requests for assistance ranging from intelligence analysis, advice, and sharing to licenses, tactical services, and coordinated support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKING UP CRITICAL DATA OUTSIDE THE ZONE OF CONFLICT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the conflict, Ukrainian government data was concentrated in data servers located within Ukraine as an effect of data-localization policies. However, pragmatism on Ukraine’s part — acknowledging the likelihood of an attack on these servers — combined with assistance from the private sector resulted in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft migrating the data from Ukraine to servers located outside of the conflict zone to enhance resilience. To defend against attacks that seek to immobilize businesses or data, it is critical to build redundancy not only in networks but also by backing up data outside of the zone of conflict. This protects data servers and facilitates rebuilding the economy at a later date. Currently, there are moves in some countries towards data localization. The example of Ukraine underlines the need to protect the physical components of cyberspace — and, in the likelihood of damage, to move data servers out of harm’s way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HACKTIVISM AND VOLUNTEERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 26, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister and minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov officially announced the formation of a volunteer IT Army of Ukraine. There appears to be some coordination from the Ukrainian government, and state officials have clearly encouraged their activities. The creation of this 150,000–200,000-strong volunteer-organized cyber force is unprecedented. The IT Army has affected more than 600 online resources in Russia, including the federal post office and pension fund, online banking, and video conference platforms. Anonymous, a hacking collective, has also declared “cyber war” on Russia and claimed credit for DDoS attacks that took down the official websites of the Kremlin and the Ministry of Defense, as well as hacking Russian state TV channels and posting pro-Ukraine content. While unorthodox, Ukrainian cyber defenses have been bolstered by this volunteer force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;looking-forward-challenges&quot;&gt;Looking Forward: Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE OPEN INTERNET AND INFLUENCE CAMPAIGNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ongoing conflict provides valuable insights into the nature of warfare across the “splinternet,” where two or more internets are fragmented and governed in differing ways. In this case, Russia has a tightly controlled information space, and Ukraine is part of a more open data space. In Russia’s internet space, the narrative is pro-Russia. China and a few others have aligned their narrative with Russia’s. However, Ukraine’s information space — part of the broader more open internet — has been the target of a stream of influence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine conflict has been dubbed “the first TikTok war,” highlighting the role of social media in modern conflicts. Social media has not only been used by warzone citizen journalists but also by people with power and authority. Ukrainian president Zelensky, a former comedian and actor, has effectively used social media to champion the cause of Ukraine and rally international support. Russian state media has also leveraged the same platforms to disseminate fake news and propaganda. Meta, Twitter, Microsoft, Alphabet, and TikTok have all taken steps to remove their content from their platforms. The Biden administration has even taken to briefing TikTok influencers on U.S. strategic goals. While social media companies are instrumental in stemming the flow of propaganda, graphic material, and hate speech, questions remain. Should social media companies be solely responsible for making these decisions during a conflict? Should there be special rules during periods of armed conflict? What bodies could or should be involved in a shared oversight framework for prominent platforms? While policymakers have been grappling with these and similar questions since before the Russia-Ukraine war, the conflagration has made such issues more pressing than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open internet presents a significant challenge for national governments who support it — not only because they are more vulnerable to malign attempts to influence public opinion, but because it is not possible, nor desired, to control all information flows. Beyond considering the roles and responsibilities of platforms in the face of malign influence campaigns, there is also the question of the psychological defense and resiliency of the individual to these influences. If the convergence between information operations and cyber operations in this conflict is a new norm in cyber warfare, then building societal psychological defense, or the collective ability of society to resist foreign malign influence activities and disinformation, will likely become an institutionalized and extended part of many national cyber defense efforts in societies that intend to maintain a “free and open” internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUNDING PRIVATE SECTOR ALLIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Ukraine, the private sector was willing and able to support its national defense, rapidly influencing the situation on the ground. While the private sector’s efforts have been crucial to Ukraine’s defense, they have also come at a significant cost. Microsoft has spent over $400 million on the conflict and will continue to provide gratis services throughout 2023 to the tune of an additional $100 million. Starlink is providing critical connectivity infrastructure to Ukraine, reportedly costing $20 million a month to maintain. Amazon is backing up the Ukrainian government, critical infrastructure, and university data outside of Ukrainian territory at considerable cost. Many U.S. tech companies have suspended the delivery of products and services to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The behaviors of these tech companies should not be confused with altruism. For example, Microsoft’s business outside of Ukraine could be affected by spillover from the conflict, so it is in its interest to step up and defend against cyberattacks. More broadly, these predominantly U.S. tech companies could face regulatory and social backlash in key markets in the United States and Europe if they were to remain neutral or continue conducting business with Russia. Therefore, certain questions regarding the sustainability of this support remain. For one, how long will firms be willing or able to provide these critical capabilities? While U.S. secretary of defense Lloyd Austin III and UK prime minister Rishi Sunak have committed to support Ukraine for the “long haul,” it is unclear whether this will also extend to supporting the private sector. Further, will private sector companies request government subsidies for their efforts? How will these companies decide which future conflicts to support, in kind or otherwise? And how would their bottom lines be affected by taking a more active NATO-aligned worldview? It is still not clear how long these types of firms will be willing and able to effectively donate these expensive services to Ukraine for the remainder of the conflict, or if this kind of support would be replicable for any other besieged country in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONTROLLING DUAL-USE TECHNOLOGIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DJI, a consumer commercial drone manufacturer, has inadvertently become an arms dealer in this conflict. Both Russia and Ukraine have utilized commercially available drones, such as the DJI Mavic 3, which costs under $2,000. These affordable drones have extended the range of the Ukrainian army and provided enhanced intelligence and communication capabilities. The Ukrainian army has even transformed some of these hobbyist drones into unmanned kamikaze bombers capable of carrying munitions up to 800 grams and of steering toward Russian targets. While DJI announced it would halt drone sales to both Moscow and Kyiv in response to their use in the conflict, commercial drones can still be sourced from other suppliers. This example of a technology that is commercial first but could be used for defense purposes presents the problem of some dual-use technologies. It also raises the issue of the difficulty for some allies to access equivalent primarily defense technologies and raises questions around how these two issues could be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUTURE INDUSTRY ADVERSARIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the large consumer tech companies involved in this conflict are American, with the notable exceptions of Chinese-owned TikTok and DJI. However, it is worth considering an alternative scenario involving a conflict with China; how would we expect commercial Chinese actors to behave in relation to the CCP? What frameworks exist around governing tech companies in case kinetic conflict between technological superpowers (e.g., the United States and China) were to emerge? How could companies that would potentially ally with an adversary behave in such a conflict? How would cyber defenses need to adapt if equivalent consequential technology companies instead supported the adversary? What would happen if a future conflict occurred in an environment where a sympathetic private sector actor did not control various aspects of critical infrastructure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 30 countries, representing more than half of the world’s economy, have announced sanctions and export controls targeting Russia due to its military operations in Ukraine. These actions have impacted the development of Russian technology and e-commerce. While sanctions against Russian technology make sense as an attempt to force compliance with international will, it is important to consider the long-term effects of exacerbating the bifurcation in technology stacks, which is largely driven by U.S.-China tensions. While bifurcation will decrease dependency, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of creating a more fragmented global technology landscape in terms of access to resources and allegiances of companies with strong links to adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACCOUNTABILITY IS NEEDED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negotiations at the United Nations created norms on responsible state behavior for the acceptable use of cyber capabilities. UN member states have committed to abide by 11 cyber norms. These norms include interstate cooperation on cybersecurity, preventing the misuse of information and communication technologies in sovereign territory, not damaging critical infrastructure, protecting critical infrastructure, taking steps to ensure supply chain security, and not interfering with emergency response teams. Despite this significant milestone, issues remain, including the lack of accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States are constantly engaging in cyber operations to achieve their national objectives. However, some states exert more restraint than others, with checks and balances in place at the national and international level placing guardrails around their cyber operations — as the United Kingdom has described it, “responsible cyber power.” However, this results in a situation where there is a group of states who are less restrained in their cyber operations (e.g., Russia, China, and Iran), posing significant threats to other states that comply with regulatory frameworks and exercise restraint (e.g., the United Kingdom and the United States). The United States and its allies have made efforts to hold state actors to account for their cyber operations which has manifested in the form of attribution. There are numerous cases of attribution of state actors for hacking attempts and commercial espionage. However, attribution does not appear to deter states from behaving badly. Stronger forms of accountability and consequences need to be developed so that there are consequences for states that do not uphold international norms, which in turn could collectively enhance international cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT PROTECTIONS FOR VOLUNTEERS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s cyber defense has relied on hundreds of thousands of IT volunteers who have supported cyber operations against the Russian state, but it is not clear to whether they are afforded any protection under international law. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, examples of participation in hostilities include activities that “directly cause harm to another party, either directly inflicting death, injury or destruction, or by directly harming the enemy’s military operations or capacity . . . interfering electronically with military computer networks and transmitting tactical targeting intelligence for a specific attack.” It is unclear to what extent a cyber operation conducted by a civilian — based in Ukraine or beyond — on Russia’s government, propaganda apparatus, and industrial base would qualify as direct participation, or whether volunteers are covered by international norms as non-state actors. For example, hackers geographically based in some territories, such as the United States or the United Kingdom, joining Ukrainian cyberattacks, could be breaking national law. The involvement of volunteer cyber forces from different geographies thus presents new challenges for international norms and laws designed with states in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are significant ramifications from the conflict in Ukraine for the global cybersecurity community. Significant investment in defense is essential to ensure cyber resilience in the face of evolving threats. While this was clear before Russia’s invasion, it was not obvious that Ukraine’s cyber defense would be as effective as it has been so far. What is clear in Ukraine’s case is that the near-decade of having to defend its national interest in cyberspace — which necessitated collaboration across government and with the whole of Ukrainian society, combined with working with allies and the private sector — has resulted in its strong cyber defense to date. Investing in cyber defense, preparing for hybrid warfare, prioritizing information security, and fostering a culture of cyber awareness throughout society has enhanced its resilience and ability to withstand Russia’s cyber and information campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia will likely remain an acute and persistent threat for many countries in the Western alliance. Therefore, there is a lot that can and should be learned from Ukraine’s experience so far to put cyber defenders on a stronger footing in the face of adversarial threats in cyberspace. Significant questions still remain around whether or not this varied and novel alliance between allies, volunteers, and the private sector in cyberspace can be replicated in another scenario. But what all will note from the Ukrainian case so far is that a good defense is perhaps just as effective as a good offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MELANIE GARSON&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-3&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the early days of the Ukraine conflict, pundits globally awaited the first “cyber war.” Building on assumptions of the evolution of warfare in the digital age and Russia’s consistent gray zone cyber activity in Ukraine since 2014, governments and security analysts were anticipating the accompanying cyber “bomb,” and they quickly began to puzzle over the lack of a clear cyber front. Many of these questions stemmed from a fundamental misunderstanding of the complexity of offensive cyber activity, as well as of its limitations in delivering widespread guaranteed impacts in the same way as kinetic activity. However, one year on, the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSCIIP) reports that cyberattacks on Ukraine continue to escalate from their pre-Christmas levels, with a particular focus on public institutions and civil infrastructure. Global cyber activity has reached some of the highest levels ever observed, heavily concentrated on Ukraine; however, due to the continued efforts of a new collective cyber defense alliance, their ability to further Russia’s kinetic activity has been limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unlikely combination of tech companies, tech platforms, tech workers, hobbyists, and hacktivists that helped Ukraine working alongside governments and international organizations has mounted “arguably the most effective cyber defense in history.” By ensuring that the internet infrastructure is secure and operational, that internet services are accessible, and that information is available and not weaponized, these non-state actors were able to rapidly alter Russia’s military communications strategy. This new cyber defense alliance continues to be able to thwart Russia’s cyber ambitions to impact critical communications pathways and has materially contributed to tipping the balance of power in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the rapid integration of these disparate cyber actors at the core of Ukraine’s wartime cyber command can provide many lessons for states in their approach to a more holistic and cooperative cyber defense, the strategy opens up a new set of risks. Bringing in civil society and commercial actors into active cyber combat puts pressure on key laws and norms, including the blurring of defensive and offensive cyber activity and the extent that this legitimizes non-state actors as parties to the conflict — and, by extension, places them as well as states as legitimate targets for retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper explores the role of these new defenders of the digital sphere and draws on the discussions of the roundtable held with representatives of the platforms, infrastructure and content distribution networks, and civil society actors as to provide recommendations for building clarity into the engagement with tech companies and non-state cyber defenders and disrupters when these are thrust onto the frontline of cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-never-ending-consolidated-threat-surface&quot;&gt;The Never-Ending Consolidated Threat Surface&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s vision of offensive cyber sits within a wider approach of “information confrontation” or “information warfare” that encompasses both the network attacks that are at the basis of most Western conceptions of offensive cyber activity and the information operations that usually sit within the U.S. definition of cognitive warfare. This has been reflected in Russian Defence Ministry statements clearly defining a strategy of disruption to both the physical network infrastructure and the information space in order to degrade the societal fabric of an opponent. Compounded by the rise of drone warfare and the multi-domain battlefield, the control of a stable internet source is a key element of strategic success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this conception of cyber, defense must span multiple physical and digital threat surfaces, from the information layer through to the backbone of the internet infrastructure, most of which are out of the control of states. Tech companies are now diversified throughout the internet stack, from the information layer, down through the hardware and device layer, into essential services and access control, and all the way to the backbone infrastructure. Meta owns more kilometers of subsea cables than British Telecom, and Starlink’s mega-constellation of LEO satellites far outpaces that of the United Kingdom and the United States, with 3,236 satellites currently operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the communications infrastructure is being consolidated, with a few companies being able to provide services throughout the internet stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SHcS3nc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Major Providers: Communications Infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.institute.global/insights/geopolitics-and-security/disrupters-and-defenders-what-ukraine-war-has-taught-us-about-power-global-tech-companies&quot;&gt;Pete Furlong and Melanie Garson, Disrupters and Defenders: What the Ukraine War Has Taught Us About the Power of Global Tech Companies (London: Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, 2022)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consolidation has increased throughout 2022 and into 2023, as companies have added to their assets at all levels of the communications infrastructure. Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter in October 2022 added a platform to the Space X family, Google Cloud’s acquisition of Mandiant increased its cloud security, and Microsoft’s investment into OpenAI suggests that the trend towards developing representation throughout the internet stack as well as control over new and emerging tech is set to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With vast amounts of the core communication infrastructure now sitting in the hands of commercial companies, the ability and agility to materially interfere with Russia’s multi-level cyber and information warfare could not be achieved without the active and willing cooperation of tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-front-line-of-commercial-cyber-power&quot;&gt;The Front Line of Commercial Cyber Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the tanks had rolled into Ukraine, many of the large tech companies had already started shoring up Ukraine’s cyber defenses alongside governments and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre for Excellence, most notably Microsoft’s detection of the Foxblade malware attack on February 23, 2022. This marked the escalation of both high-profile and more subtle commercial cyber power taking on the defense of Ukraine and limiting Russia’s actions across the physical and digital components of the communications ecosystem, as well as supporting the dissemination of life-saving real time information and applications for Ukrainians. Russia found itself up against the brightest cyber minds as well as the collective might of the global cyber community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-resilient-internet-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Building Resilient Internet Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet “backbone” — the wires, pipes, and servers that keep it operational — is notoriously fragile to both environmental events and deliberate interference. Regaining operational function once it is damaged can often be challenging, such as in Tonga which suffered nearly five weeks of internet outage after its subsea cable was damaged in a volcanic eruption. Similarly, the recent Cyclone Gabrielle in New Zealand and the earthquake in Turkey left vast areas with limited connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, human internet traffic dropped as much as 33 percent in the days immediately after the invasion. This was driven by Russia’s encroachment on the routing of data — leaving parts of Ukraine reliant on Russian cables and subject to Russia’s restrictions and limitations — such as the Viasat KA-SAT attack that impacted routers in Ukraine and consistent physical degradation to fiber optic cables and electrical power facilities from targeted bombings. Through the strategic destruction of over 4,000 mobile base stations, thousands of kilometers of fiber optic cable, and 18 Ukrainian radio broadcast towers, Russia has prevented local residents from sharing information or receiving information on humanitarian corridors. Russia also keeps its own soldiers in a media blackout so they cannot question their actions. As Russia physically occupies cities, it also occupies the digital ecosystem, with internet traffic rerouted from Ukrainian networks to Russian ones and Ukrainian internet service providers threatened with the loss of their communication equipment unless they join the Russian networks. A parallel more resilient and operational internet became critical to Ukraine’s ability to counter the Russian offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starlink’s rapid response to Mykhailo Fedorov’s tweet that saw 500 terminals on the ground in Ukraine within five days, 25 of which were transmitting data within a week, has now been widely confirmed as being determinative in ensuring military and civilian communications. Between mid-March and December 2022, Starlink traffic in Ukraine increased by 1,600 percent. Highly resilient and able to withstand electronic jamming attacks more adeptly than previously anticipated, Starlink’s shoring up of Ukraine’s internet infrastructure has been the lynchpin of basic battlefield communications, from weapons supply arrivals to its more controversial use in drone warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, internet backbone carriers were withdrawing their service provision in Russia. By March 7, 2022, Cogent and Lumen — two of the world’s largest internet service providers, who had provided transit for Russia’s key national fiber backbone operators including Rostelcom and Transtelcom, its key mobile phone operators, and Russia’s search engine Yandex — stopped providing services. Driven by the possibility that the networks could be used as part of Russia’s offensive cyber activity and concern for its employees, with downstream impacts felt as far as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Belarus, and Iran, this exit left Russia with the challenge of finding alternative infrastructure provisions to enable its strategic internal and external cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;embedding-internet-security&quot;&gt;Embedding Internet Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities on the Ukraine-Russia cyber front had been bubbling since 2016. However, the increase of malicious cyber activity in the months prior to the physical invasion provided governments and tech companies opportunities to secure the digital domain more effectively than the physical battlefield. The CyberPeace Institute has tracked over 1,408 cyberattacks and operations from across 87 different threat actors related to the Ukraine conflict, and whilst these numbers are significant, they likely still do not capture the full picture of the cybersecurity threat. Cloudflare has reported that in March 2022 application layer attacks in Ukraine rose by 1,300 percent and that between February 2022 and February 2023 an average of 10 percent of all traffic to Ukraine was mitigations of potential attacks. At its high point on October 29, 2022, 39 percent of total traffic to Cloudflare’s Ukrainian customer websites was DDoS attack traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously noted, Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Centre (MSTIC) had been working closely with Ukraine’s government and was able to mitigate the “Foxblade” wiper software on 19 government and critical infrastructure entities across the Ukraine government on the day before the war started. It continued to provide support, identifying and protecting against numerous destructive cyberattacks on nearly 50 Ukrainian agencies and entities as well as over 128 targets including government agencies and nongovernmental agencies in 42 countries. Similarly, Cisco Talos was working closely with the government of Ukraine to respond to the WhisperGate malware in January 2022 and translated their responses into protections for customers across Ukraine. Other companies, such as ESET and Recorded Future, have provided key services, tools, and threat intelligence. Google has also reported its role in countering the 250 percent increase in phishing attacks targeting Ukraine and 300 percent increase targeting NATO countries (as compared to 2020), as well as more destructive attacks in Ukraine than in the previous eight years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Microsoft and AWS were pivotal in securing Ukraine’s public sector infrastructure by facilitating the transfer of its data from physical data centers to the cloud within 10 weeks of the Ukraine government passing an urgent amendment to its data protection law on February 17, 2022, to allow data to be held externally. Microsoft provided $107 million of technology services to facilitate this transition. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister and minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, highlighted the contribution of AWS in migrating key public registers and records to the cloud as “one of the biggest contributions to Ukrainian victory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while large companies like Google have provided cybersecurity protections for over 150 humanitarian organizations from DDoS attacks through its Project Shield, smaller companies essential to the cybersecurity ecosystem have also thrown their weight into the collective defense of Ukraine’s internet. Cloudflare has been providing internet availability monitoring services to Ukraine’s government, moving secure encryption key data for customers out of at-risk data centers in Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus, and providing free protections for Ukrainian organizations under its Project Galileo. Romanian company BitDefender offered a year’s worth of free cybersecurity assistance to business, government, and private citizens of Ukraine. Similarly, California based Vector AI offered its services free of charge for targets or organizations under attack, and companies such as SentinelOne, Avast, and CrowdStrike offered services or decryptors for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ensuring-internet-accessibility&quot;&gt;Ensuring Internet Accessibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of companies controlling the distribution of content (content distribution networks or CDNs) is very small and critical in facilitating internet accessibility. Companies with a very small market share can have a large impact on access to the internet and companies such as Cloudflare — with 80 percent of market share — are in a key position to keep the internet accessible. The role of internet accessibility in countering Russia’s cyber offense is more nuanced than that of ensuring security, as it requires managing compliance with sanctions alongside providing access to the internet to balance Russia’s information warfare. While companies such as Fastly, alongside a number of other web companies, quickly ceased working with Russian-based companies altogether, other CDNs stopped paid services to comply with international sanctions but continued to provide free services. Cloudflare, which had been threatened with Russian shutdowns previously, has taken the position that Russia would celebrate their closure if they were to exit and opted to continue providing free, open, private, and secure internet services to the Russian people to counter Russia’s attempts to raise a digital iron curtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Virtual Private Network (VPN) providers have continued to counter Russian attempts to separate from the rest of the internet by providing avenues for Russians to stay connected to international media sources. VPN use in Russia reached a peak demand of 2,692 percent above average on March 14, 2022. as access to the open internet became constricted. Canada’s Windscribe publicly committed to providing an extra 30GB of data freely to both sides of the conflict, ensuring that Russians have access to the open internet. ProtonVPN waived all fees from Russian customers on the basis of a “strong moral obligation” to be there and ensure the Russian people have freedom of access to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;secure-hardware-for-hard-war&quot;&gt;Secure Hardware for Hard War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communications hardware and the apps that run on it have also become key determinants in the offense-defense balance. Access to personal communication devices has become key, both for soldiers on the battlefield and civilian threat alerts. Affordable hardware is required for the internet, but the sanctions regime has restricted most providers including Apple, Samsung, Lenovo, HP, AMD, Dell, and Intel from operating in Russia and selling the semiconductors, computers, phones, and server hardware that form the physical end point of the communications system. This also impacts the dual-use hardware that enables critical technologies, such as unmanned drones. Ukraine can rely on diversified sources of communications hardware to enable sophisticated battlefield technologies; however, Russia is buying communications hardware, such as electronic jammers, on Chinese-owned AliExpress. This access to diversified supply of trustworthy and secure hardware, in order to both operate and process the information gathered from drones, has reshaped Ukraine’s ability to continually resist Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defending-the-information-frontier&quot;&gt;Defending the Information Frontier&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Russia’s cyber strategy heavily rooted in the battle for control of the information domain, it is at this level that tech companies have had to fight some of their hardest battles. Russia’s physical digital occupation strategy — restricting internet access through physical means, such as by rerouting networks — has been accompanied by an equally draconian censorship strategy both inside Russia and in occupied parts of Ukraine. While Russia’s media law punishing “fake news” — which was passed in the early days of the conflict — led to most media companies and platforms being forced to leave Russia, its physical occupation in parts of Ukraine have left Ukrainians without key information sources including Instagram, YouTube, and the messaging app Viber. Google’s search engine was disabled in Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kherson on the claim that it was advocating violence and terrorism against Russians, and Russia claimed to have shut Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube in parts of Zaporizhzhia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of tech platforms in balancing information flows and countering Russia’s massive influence operations capacity became critical for both strategic and humanitarian reasons even before the kinetic offensive began. Early signs of the Russian invasion were spotted by open-source researchers monitoring traffic data on Google Maps, requiring Google to disable it in order to protect Ukrainian citizens from detection. And as Russian state-owned media became the driving force of disseminating false content about the invasion, platforms such as Meta, Reddit, TikTok, Alphabet (the parent company of Google and YouTube), Microsoft, Spotify, and Telegram restricted access to RT and Sputnik news in Europe — and in some cases globally — and their apps were banned from app stores. Adobe prevented Russian government-controlled media organizations from accessing its creative and document cloud services to avoid being complicit in the creation of harmful information. Google, YouTube, Twitter, and Meta restricted Russian state-based entities from being able to monetize ads on their platforms, and companies including Snapchat and the Japanese-based company Viber implemented wider bans on displaying ads across their apps. Search engines including DuckDuckGo, Google, and Bing downranked links associated with Russian disinformation. Even Chinese platforms such as Douyin, Weibo, WeChat, and Bilibili undertook a process of blocking accounts spreading information that could put Chinese students in Ukraine at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to counterbalance Russia’s information offensive and recognizing the strategic and humanitarian imperative to secure access to information, commercial tech companies across the ecosystem were quick to facilitate alternative access to information, both for Ukrainians and Russians. Google disrupted over 1,950 instances of Russian information operation on its platforms in 2022, including claims that Ukraine operates biolaboratories for generating biological weapons and information operations linked to destructive malware attacks. Microsoft’s Russian Propaganda Index run by its AI for Good Lab also recorded significant increases in traffic to Russian propaganda websites from January 2022, with a rise of 216 percent in the last week of February 2022. Through identifying the scope of the disinformation globally, tech companies enabled governments, companies, and other organizations to implement counter-responses and neutralize the disinformation strategies. Google’s Trust &amp;amp; Safety team has disabled accounts associated with coordinated information operations, including the disruption of YouTube channels, blogs, and AdSense accounts, and has removed domains from Google News surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech companies have also sought to balance this by providing alternate sources for legitimate information to the Russian people. Twitter launched a parallel site on the dark web alongside its shadow-banning of Russian government accounts. Media outlets have taken advantage of the increased Telegram use to create new sources of news distribution, and Microsoft’s Skype extended free communication in and out of Ukraine. Cumulatively, these rapid and far-reaching actions have restrained the impact of Russia’s digital information blockade, as a strategic tool to facilitate both the active conflict and its supporting actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-companies-in-the-trenches&quot;&gt;Private Companies in the Trenches&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the tech companies, however, there is another cadre of private actors and companies in the trenches of the cyber elements of the conflict. The cyber defense ecosystem also relies on a complex web of ethical hackers, or “cybersecurity researchers,” who report vulnerabilities to companies and governments. Prior to the conflict, ethical hacking was illegal in Ukraine, with fines for those found detecting bugs in state computers. In early February 2022, however, in the face of mounting cyberattacks, the Ukraine government committed to decriminalize bug bounties to allow for better detection of security vulnerabilities. At the outset of the war, homegrown cybersecurity companies such as Cyber Unit Technologies approached the government to offer their help, forming the basis of Mykhailo Fedorov’s 150,000–200,000-strong IT Army. Hacken.io, the Kyiv-based bug bounty platform, also launched a “Cyber Army” to encourage security researchers on its platform to search for vulnerabilities in Russian websites to be used by the government. Similarly, the Estonia-based bug bounty platform HackenProof invited disclosure of critical vulnerabilities in both Ukrainian and Russian infrastructure, with commitment to disclose them to the Ukrainian authorities for both defensive and offensive use. U.S.-based cybersecurity research companies such as HackerOne, in compliance with the sanction regimes, were able to continue facilitating bounty payments to Ukrainian cybersecurity researchers after resolving some technical difficulties, but they paused payments to researchers in Belarus and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-of-private-cyber-defenders-in-geopolitical-crises&quot;&gt;Challenges of Private Cyber Defenders in Geopolitical Crises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the response of tech companies to defend across the cyber ecosystem has been unprecedented and contributed significantly to Ukraine’s success to date, it has not been without challenges. The limited exposure of tech companies to engagement at this level has led at times to a lack of appreciation of the complexity of their actions, as well as a lack of consistency and coherence across policies. From diplomacy by Twitter to navigating sanctions regimes, political pressure, and the negative impacts of rapid decisionmaking, the lack of experience that private cyber defenders have in navigating geopolitical crises has led to conflicting actions that could at times undermine internet resilience and fail at countering Russia’s offensive cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moving-fast-and-breaking-things&quot;&gt;Moving Fast and Breaking Things&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid action of tech companies in the early days of the crisis reflects an agility that can be valuable to tip the balance of power in a conflict. Whether responding to political and corporate pressure from the outpouring of support for Ukraine, a need to protect employees, fear of sanctions, Russia’s “fake news law,” a genuine demonstration of disapproval, or in some cases even to increase their public relations value, companies moved fast and were far-reaching in their actions. Whilst this may have had measurable impacts at the time, it may also not have offered sufficient time to consider the full ramifications of their actions for long-term cyber stability. This at times has led to backtracking or possibly undermining avenues to counter Russia’s cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sanctions regime threatened the right of Russians to have universal connectivity and left the Russian people more at risk of government information control strategies, as well as threatening the basic nature of the open, globally connected, secure and trustworthy internet. After significant lobbying by Access Now and the Wikimedia Foundation, in April 2022 the U.S. government issued an advisory providing exemptions for companies providing internet services, recognizing the need to keep information flows accessible to people in Russia and Belarus. However, this came too late for key companies such as Lumen and Cogent Communications, who had already withdrawn their services from Russia, partly due to unclear policy. At the other end of the spectrum, the bug bounty platform HackerOne found itself disabling payments to Ukrainian cybersecurity researchers whilst they sought to amend their systems to comply with the sanctions regimes. This prevented them from providing crucial support to Ukrainian researchers — as well as access to knowledge of key vulnerabilities at a critical time, potentially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some companies tried to move slower to strike a more balanced position between supporting Ukraine and preserving the integrity of the internet and access to information for Russians, they found themselves under greater pressure from public calls from Ukraine’s government and consequent stakeholder pressures rather than that of their own governments. In Myanmar, civil society organizations urged Telenor to stay in place as an alternative might be complicit with the regime, thereby worsening the situation. Navigating this level of geopolitical foresight is out of the scope of normal operating procedure for many companies and opens the question of how home governments can shield companies that may have to make unpopular decisions for long-term cybersecurity and internet stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-coherence-to-complexity&quot;&gt;Finding Coherence to Complexity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has highlighted the challenge for commercial companies to find coherence and consistency when navigating information warfare in the heat of complex geopolitical crises. While companies may have acted quickly, this has sometimes been inconsistent with previous actions or policies and has required them to backtrack on their actions. Meta was challenged by inconsistencies within their own content moderation policies when evidence emerged that they had provided a temporary change to their hate-speech policies to allow calls for violence against Russians and Russian soldiers, including Russian president Vladimir Putin and Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. They then had to revise, limit, and reverse decisions in the face of accusations from Russia that they were fueling hate against the Russian people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media platforms also found themselves caught in a dilemma when placed in the position of being the evidence repository of war crimes that could be crucial for future criminal tribunals, particularly with how this may intersect with their own terms of service preventing illegal and harmful content. Furthermore, Twitter’s turn to international humanitarian law as the basis of banning tweets showing images of prisoners of war highlighted not only the potential that private companies could be considered parties to the conflict but the lack of clear internal or external guidelines for commercial actors’ decisionmaking in complex geopolitical crises. Tech companies also found themselves caught in balancing public disclosures of their support, having to tread carefully between protecting employees, following corporate principles, and ensuring that their information does not provide strategic advantages for Russia — decisions outside of the norms of its responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies reported that legal counsel was not always nuanced, making it hard for many to carry out a holistic assessment of the wider geopolitical implications of their actions and manage the competing priorities inherent to the cyber dimensions of the conflict. Key to this challenge is that companies are used to assessing risks through a financial lens, rather than through societal priorities or by seeking to reduce their liabilities. For a company that deals with encryption standards, an exit from Russia may be a reduction of liability; but with a long-term geopolitical focus on cyber stability, if that company is replaced by a Russian equivalent, the cyber ecosystem may be more insecure. If cyber stability is going to depend on the controllers of the communications infrastructure being able to navigate through the complexity of both cyber-enabled and cyber-dependent warfare, then new mechanisms are going to be required in order to guarantee greater coherence in times of crises. This includes greater understanding of the decisionmaking procedures that companies undertake in addressing their involvement in geopolitical crises, as well as mechanisms to provide companies with the foundational understanding of the impact of discrete actions through the internet stack — such as withdrawal of service — on geopolitical conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wavering-clarity-and-commitment&quot;&gt;Wavering Clarity and Commitment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As tech companies responded both independently and under overt and covert political pressure to counteract Russia’s deliberate strategy of cutting or destabilizing internet access, they could not predict the level of long-term commitment this would entail. This has led to tech companies wavering in their commitments and trying to limit the use of their infrastructure provisions, possibly creating greater instability. Starlink — despite its importance to Ukraine’s defense, with over 150,000 Ukrainians using it daily to access the internet by May 2022, and its role in enabling surveillance and reconnaissance aerial vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles — threatened to stop funding the program and asked the Pentagon to take over the costs. Although a large proportion of terminal and internet use costs were being covered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other partners, Starlink was seeking further support. Further, SpaceX has restricted the use of Starlink for drones, highlighting that the support was intended for humanitarian purposes but not to be weaponized — possibly putting Ukraine at greater risk, both through the action itself and through the public declaration of their position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2022, Microsoft pledged a further $100 million to Ukraine’s digital alliance, promising that Ukraine would be able to use Microsoft’s cloud and data centers in Europe throughout 2023. While the continued support is generous, as Microsoft chairman Brad Smith stated at the Munich Security Conference in February 2023, it is a “one year at a time” approach. This stands in contrast to state positions, such as the U.S. promise to stand by Ukraine “for as long as it takes.” Questions arise as to the dangers of dependency on critical infrastructure or cybersecurity support that can be withdrawn on a whim or under corporate pressures and obligations to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-defenders-as-legitimate-targets&quot;&gt;Cyber Defenders as Legitimate Targets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has been clear that its support in the Ukraine conflict is entirely defensive, as any offensive action would violate its pledge made as a part of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, from a legal standpoint commercial tech companies may find themselves technically participants to the conflict and thus legitimate targets for attack, particularly with the lines between consumer and military tech becoming more blurred and many militaries relying on consumer tech for military. Even the most sophisticated companies might not anticipate this, with Starlink’s restriction on the use of its terminals for offensive purposes reflecting that they hadn’t fully anticipated this possibility. This would turn quite closely on the nexus between the private company’s action and the consequent military action, or whether the data held in a private cloud was military data. The recent attempt by Ukraine to draft a law to legalize its volunteer IT army into part of its cyber command may help to mitigate the ambiguity for some individual security researchers. However, companies may still remain exposed. Actions such as that of Hacken.io’s “Cyber Army,” in which the intention to hand vulnerabilities to the Ukrainian authorities is clearly stated, could be construed as voluntary participation in hostilities — and thus open the possibility of a private company becoming a legitimate target in retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREPARING FOR THE NEXT CYBER-ENABLED CRISIS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era of increasing converging crises, the risks exposed by the Ukraine war are not fading. Ukraine benefited from strong Western support, both politically and in the public sphere, making the case for tech company action relatively clear. In other contexts, it may not be so straightforward. Tech companies have struggled to balance their engagement in more complex crises such as ones in Myanmar and Ethiopia, and the closure of international offices as part of the tech downturn — such as that of Twitter’s only African office — could leave them ill-prepared to address future global challenges. It is also still not clear how companies will fully address the crisis-inducing potential of generative AI systems and similar emerging technologies that could be exploited in misinformation campaigns by reducing the barrier to generating synthetic media, deepfakes, and malicious content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict in Ukraine has highlighted the challenges and dangers to cyber stability of trying to formulate sensitive policies under pressure, along with the urgent need for tech companies to be able to assess the impact of their individual and cumulative actions in a crisis or in post-crisis stabilization and reconstruction. New mechanisms are needed, similar to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) frameworks or Covid-19 protocols, that embed geopolitical risk considerations into the corporate governance of those companies responsible for the cyber ecosystem, in order to ensure coherence and consistency across geopolitical crises. Companies should also seek to embed tech geopolitics experts who see beyond liability into more holistic geopolitical impacts in their decisionmaking procedures, as well as civil society organizations that can provide more nuanced pictures of situations in a country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, governments and the international community need to rethink their interactions with big tech to ensure that they are providing sufficient support for companies to balance their actions with the core principles and norms of the liberal and democratic world order. The role of the company in the internet stack often determines its level of interaction across the cyber ecosystem. Tech companies have highlighted the need for neutral convenors to assist in helping align action without it appearing like big tech collusion or strong-arming. Newer agreements and partnerships, such as the Declaration for the Future of the Internet and the Freedom Online Coalition, have been formulated with these kinds of issues in mind but have struggled to gain influence and traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet stability is at the heart of the multi-domain era of warfare. As militaries invest in increasingly interconnected and intelligent weaponry, access to stable, resilient, and secure communications is crucial. And as offensive strategies expand from the depths of the sea to potential interference in interplanetary networking, the range of actors required to defend these domains far expand the capabilities of most militaries alone. Cyber power will belong to those states that create the mechanisms to ensure the coherence, consistency, transparency, reliability, and geopolitical responsibility of those private actors currently defending the cyber front lines of the Ukraine conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;a-strategic-approach&quot;&gt;A Strategic Approach&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMY ERTAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-4&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, the NATO formally acknowledged the need to defend against cyber threats. Over the following two decades, cyber defense was institutionalized and understood as a core part of national defense, by both allies and the alliance. As an example, since 2016, NATO allies have recognized cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea. At the national level, the majority of states have evolved their position on cyber defense through the development of national strategies, the establishment of national authorities responsible for defending against cyber threats, and a range of additional initiatives designed to deter, detect, defend against, and respond to malicious cyber activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments are intrinsically linked with changes in the increasingly complex cyber threat landscape. Now more than ever, adversarial states have shown a willingness and capability to use cyber operations to support their strategic objectives. As a result, cyberspace now plays a key role in strategic competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept explains, “Malign actors seek to degrade our critical infrastructure, interfere with our government services, extract intelligence, steal intellectual property and impede our military activities.” For that reason, though recognizing that nations must defend themselves against the full breadth of cyber threats, this paper specifically focuses on state-sponsored threat actors, who attempt to use cyberspace to undermine their target’s national security to further their own strategic and military objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine, for example, has highlighted Russia’s willingness to leverage cyber operations in the run-up to — and during — the invasion, against Ukraine and others. Russia has used cyber operations to support a range of strategic objectives in Ukraine, from destructive malware to disrupt and degrade the activities of the Ukrainian government and military to attacks on civilian infrastructure — including critical national infrastructure — to undermine public confidence and trust in the Ukrainian government. The uptick in Russian state-sponsored activity against Ukraine in the months leading up to and including the start of the invasion also showed that the attackers were maximizing their access to data and systems to support intelligence gathering, stealing or leaking sensitive information to further their narratives. Some public reports reveal the targeting of state and non-state actors through cyber operations and kinetic military strikes simultaneously, though it remains unclear if these were coordinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond those involved in Ukraine, there are a number of state and state-sponsored actors that pose a threat to NATO allies and like-minded states. The United Kingdom has highlighted that China and Russia pose the greatest threat to its national security due to evidence of their sophisticated cyber capabilities, followed by Iran and North Korea. Disruption due to malicious cyber activity has been felt recently across and beyond the alliance. These include a significant disruption from major cyberattacks against Albania’s national information infrastructure in mid-2022, which Albania and other nations have publicly attributed to Iran. More recently, in March 2023, North Macedonia hosted a NATO senior stakeholder visit concerning its ongoing experience defending against hybrid attacks, including cyberattacks. Beyond the significant loss of communications in Ukraine, a major cyberattack against private satellite provider Viasat in February 2022 was reported to have caused disruptions across Europe, far beyond Ukraine’s borders. Throughout 2022, multiple industry research reports have highlighted an increase in malicious cyber activity on users across NATO countries and have linked the activity to several state-sponsored threat actors, largely under the direction of Russian government agencies as well as China-sponsored cyber actors. Nor has Russian malicious cyber activity been limited solely to targets in Ukraine. According to Google, phishing attacks against users in NATO countries from Russian government-sponsored cyber threat actors increased by 300 percent in 2022 compared to 2020. These cyber campaigns are aimed at a broad range of targets, from government and critical infrastructure to private sector organizations and citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, malicious activity in cyberspace against NATO has been assessed as falling below the level of armed conflict. Researchers focusing on cyber defense and national security nonetheless face a conceptual challenge: while “cyber warfare” appears to set the bar too high, given that most cyber operations are below the threshold of war, it is also inaccurate to say that current activity in cyberspace represents a “peaceful” state. Experts have presented conceptual models to understand the current nature of cyberspace, speaking of a state of “un-peace,” or attempting to understand cyber operations within the strategic studies lenses of “sub-threshold” or “gray zone” warfare. In essence, the message for policymakers, as well as senior political and military leaders, is clear: there is no peace in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consensus at NATO is that, as stated firmly in the 2022 Strategic Concept, “Cyberspace is contested at all times.” It is no longer exceptional that states, including NATO members, face disruption to their critical infrastructure due to malicious cyber activity. Reflecting on recent cyberattacks against Ukraine, research by the Economic Security Council of Ukraine argues that the opportunistic use of cyberspace to seek strategic advantages is not expected to change any time soon. Instead, increasing aggression in cyberspace is the “new normal,” and in the context of growing instability internationally, this has several key implications for cyber defenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing this new escalated baseline for state-sponsored cyber activity against NATO and like-minded countries, including Ukraine, this paper reflects on the current cyber threat landscape to consider how NATO allies and like-minded states may effectively defend themselves in this new normal. With a particular focus on the strategic landscape, the paper attends to the need for dynamic strategic positioning for cyber defense, national and international resilience-building efforts, and sustainable engagement with relevant industry actors in peacetime, crisis, and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-comprehensive-strategic-approach-to-cyberspace&quot;&gt;A Comprehensive Strategic Approach to Cyberspace&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Ukraine, attacks on NATO nations add to the growing body of evidence that cyberspace is always contested. Russia “seeks to establish spheres of influence and direct control through coercion, subversion, aggression and annexation,” using “conventional, cyber and hybrid means against us [NATO members] and our [their] partners.” It is not alone. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) “strives to subvert the rules-based international order, including in the space, cyber and maritime domains,” using “malicious hybrid and cyber operations and its confrontational rhetoric and disinformation to target Allies and harm Alliance security.” More generally, growing geopolitical instability over the past year has brought security to the forefront of state agendas around the world and prompted a revisiting of assumptions around national security and defense postures. Cyber defense must be considered within this reckoning, reflecting how the cyber threat landscape has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defending the rules-based international order requires a cohesive strategic vision, and states cannot go this alone. Broadly speaking, democratic states must not loosen their commitment to the rules-based order — they must instead, as the 2023 Munich Security Conference report reflected, do more to ensure a stable proposal to make this order work for a greater number of states that may otherwise be attracted to Russia and China’s attempts at revisionism. In the cyber domain, there is an equal need to agree on how democratic states can continue to cooperate to develop norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, address issues of cyber deterrence, and raise the cost of malicious cyber activity against them. The 2023 U.S. Cybersecurity Strategy outlines an ambitious national agenda for cyberspace that will only be strengthened by sustainable partnerships and the effective use of international organizations, such as NATO, to form a coherent international approach to adversarial state threats. Consensus commitment to using international frameworks to address strategic international threats in cyberspace, whether at the NATO alliance level or beyond, provides a level of collective strength that exceeds any individual state’s efforts to challenge the contested geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the increasing ease with which authoritarian states use malicious cyber activity to undermine the current rules-based international order requires a commitment from NATO allies and like-minded states to refuse to tolerate this “new normal” and impose painful consequences in response to these escalating levels of malicious cyber activity. This includes a refusal to accept the normalization of state-sponsored malicious cyber activity against critical infrastructure. Democratic states can steer a proactive course by explicitly noting recent escalation in cyberspace and refusing to be complacent to this new, raised baseline of more frequent and disruptive cyberattacks by adversarial state-sponsored actors. This will involve renewing their pledge to a norms-based approach to cyberspace, embracing a dynamic approach to develop new policies and impose costs in line with the evolving cyber threat landscapes, and not sacrificing any commitment to the principles of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, even as adversaries attempt to shirk them in attempt to gain offensive advantages. Any alternative course risks being perpetually on the back foot, handing the initiative to authoritarian states for them to shape cyberspace to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various international organizations can help facilitate this shift in vision to different degrees, including but not limited to the NATO, the European Union, the United Nations, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). NATO has made it clear that a single or cumulative set of malicious cyber activities may reach a level of an armed attack, at which point NATO’s North Atlantic Council may invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This decision is to be taken on a case-by-case basis. Yet for this threshold of “armed attack” to be meaningful, it is essential to have a clear understanding of baseline activity. This means being proactive and refusing to become, as one NATO colleague puts it, a “boiling frog” — referring to an analogy in which a frog in a pot does not realize its worsening situation if the water around it comes to a boil gradually. States must ensure that they do not unwittingly build a tolerance to escalated activity, thus prompting future escalation. Therefore, to prevent adversarial actors subtly raising the threshold of acceptable malicious cyber behavior, states must both deliver on their rhetoric to hold responsible threat actors accountable and double down on resilience to decrease the success of subsequent malicious cyber campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decades-long debate on how deterrence applies in cyberspace has highlighted the complexities of feasibly and consistently holding adversaries accountable. It has become clear that NATO deterrence in cyberspace is underpinned by the ability to deliver meaningful consequences to malicious cyber threat actors. Norms work if they are upheld; states thus require the ability to impose costs on others who intentionally seek to undermine them. The discourse on international norms in cyberspace reveals a contested and complex environment in which in which many nations may have different positions. Still, NATO allies have made it clear in a 2022 statement that NATO is “ready to impose costs on those who harm us [its members] in cyberspace.” It also pledged to revise the alliance’s deterrence and defense posture, including in cyberspace. The successful application of these principles will call for action from beyond the NATO alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a stance not only requires a vision that plans for a variety of future threat landscapes but one that also enables collaboration between states and international organizations to develop a comprehensive answer to cyber defense and deterrence. Within NATO, a coherent allied approach on how cyber contributes to overall deterrence and defense will lay out the consequences of malicious activity in cyberspace to malign state actors. This signaling, in addition to existing diplomatic and economic tools such as joint cyber attribution or responses in other non-cyber domains, shows that allies can be dynamic and act firmly where norms continue to be challenged by states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the national level, relevant stakeholders and decisionmakers across defense communities must understand the nature of cyberspace and the challenges surrounding cyber deterrence concepts. Crucially, they must also understand that the pace and scale of cyberattacks are unlikely to slow down unless actions are taken to adapt and respond proactively. While cyber defenders might feel they are constantly firefighting attempted cyberattacks, failing to make time to elaborate a strategic vision to respond to these attacks risks “missing the forest for the trees” and remaining stuck in a reactive posture in which the firefighting will never cease — and may in fact increase. Without a consistent conceptual approach to cyber deterrence, accompanied by adherence to a comprehensive strategic vision both nationally and internationally, states remain disadvantaged when adversarial states appear to act unpredictably. Strategic thinking also needs to include, and take place on, a supra-national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;remodeling-cyber-resilience&quot;&gt;Remodeling Cyber Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing instability across the international landscape has prompted a refocus on cyber defense and resilience as an integral part of national defense. Resilience in this context refers to society’s ability to resist and recover from shocks and combines both civil preparedness and military capability; cyber resilience extends this state to systems relying on cyber resources. There is a growing recognition that governments need greater insight into their cyber resilience posture across the entire national ecosystem, including across the private sector and especially relating to critical infrastructure. In line with a forward-looking strategic vision, a strong cyber resilience posture has been recognized as essential to deter, detect, and prevent malicious cyber activity. Many states have set out their intended plans to enhance their cyber resilience, either as part of a cyber defense strategy or within broader national security doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience forms a core part of NATO’s founding principles, in which Article 3 outlines the responsibility of allies to “maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack” via “self-help and mutual aid.” For cyber defense specifically, NATO encourages nations to strengthen their defensive posture in cyberspace through three mechanisms: the NATO Defence Planning Process, which includes cyber-related capability targets for allies over a four-year cycle; the Cyber Defence Pledge, whereby since 2016 allies have committed to enhancing their cyber defenses with a focus on seven key objectives; and more broadly, the support of each NATO nation’s seven baseline requirements for national resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, many NATO allies have already articulated their cyber defense vision. However, resilience is a continuous and iterative process, and as states face the escalating security situation in the Euro-Atlantic area, their momentum must not falter. Not only must states work to overcome persistent challenges facing capability building relating to cyber defense, but they must also adapt to the threat landscape considering activity in and beyond Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the former, some challenges are systemic and experienced by the majority of states to some degree, when it comes to strengthening their cyber defense and resilience posture. Limited investment, a shortfall in the skilled cyber workforce (particularly in the public sector and the defense forces), organizational resistance to change, legacy systems, and disengaged leaders can all lead to stagnancy in maturing a state’s cyber defense and resilience posture. To address and overcome barriers to greater cyber defense and preparedness, states must be able to track progress and react whenever they risk falling short of delivering their strategic visions. This requires top-level leadership across government and defense forces, a framework for effective civil-military cooperation — particularly in the high-level transition from peacetime to crisis or conflict — and a consideration of how cyber activity on critical infrastructure may impact military mobility. Enhancing resilience and situational awareness means tackling systemic challenges relating to information-sharing at the national level and between allies. Further, in recent years greater attention has been given to the importance of a healthy national ecosystem of cybersecurity industry actors who can swiftly offer support in a crisis and who are resilient themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective resilience also means taking a comprehensive approach to cyber defense, which includes tackling challenges in new ways. For example, while many states have now released plans addressing the education of a cyber workforce, there is room for improvement. Few states have a defined strategy for the retention of cyber expertise within the public sector, where they risk losing experts to competitive industry packages, and few states have published a declarative perspective on how they are approaching recruitment of cyber experts for the public sector or the military. For all states, there is a great deal of opportunity to explore in hiring through targeting diversity of all kinds, whether based on gender, career stage (e.g., attracting mid-career talent from other sectors into cyber defense), or discipline (e.g., attracting economists or psychologists into the field). This example of recruitment is one of many in which adjusting to the modern defense environment requires a gear-change in tactics, and states must continue to look forward to acting proactively and decisively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at current events, Ukraine has shown a significant amount about cyber resilience in times of conflict. Significant commentary has focused on the fact that the large-scale cyber campaigns leveraged against Ukraine have had little apparent success. The foremost reason for this is often credited to Ukraine’s cyber resilience, much of which had been actively developed in response to previous Russian aggression against Ukraine, particularly from 2014 onwards. Cyber capacity-building measures appear to have contributed substantively to Ukraine’s resilience, and in turn, the war in Ukraine has prompted states to reflect on cyber defense within broader resilience and crisis management response plans. There are opportunities across the board to strengthen preparedness for a cyber crisis, whether it is by ensuring that there is a cyber crisis response plan or by including cyber in national crisis response frameworks. Such plans should be comprehensive, involving stakeholders across the public and private sectors, with regular exercising to maximize readiness in case of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related view on Ukraine’s impressive cyber resilience posture heralds the significant assistance Ukraine received from the United States and others since 2014, which allowed it to decrease its reliance on insecure software and implement many of the cyber defenses that protected it against of Russia’s activity in cyberspace. Outside of armed conflict, the principle of assistance to allies remains much the same and is increasingly relevant beyond formal NATO structures. Ukraine showed allies how critical it is that where a state needs help to protect itself against an aggressor, it gets the support required. Certainly, within the NATO alliance, the principle of resilience follows the adage “a rising tide lifts all ships”; as the relatively more vulnerable states mature their national resilience to malicious cyber activity, the alliance becomes more resilient overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond current commitments, NATO members and like-minded states must be empowered to highlight the best use of capacity-building measures, perhaps by using national cyber maturity assessments (or similar) to check where a state is not meeting minimum baseline levels of security or where they are not making progress over time. The use of a metric-driven approach to cyber resilience — taking care to choose appropriate metrics, of course — would enable states to check their progress over time and to highlight where they are struggling with progress and may need assistance, such as the sharing of best practices, from allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, events in Ukraine and beyond have highlighted the need for effective assistance coordination mechanisms, which could be activated in response to significant malicious cyber activity. Currently, there are no comprehensive frameworks for effectively coordinating cyber assistance in a crisis. Ukraine highlighted this need for a coordinator to swiftly prioritize needs and allocate tasks to a range of public and private actors offering bilateral assistance. Such a framework would need to think about how the receiver prioritizes its most urgent needs in a cyber crisis (or a crisis with cyber aspects); articulates these needs to potential helpers; deconflicts offers of assistance from various actors; arranges the logistics of assistance, including physical movement and access to technology; and deconflicts any issues relating to legal constraints or privileges and immunities, ensuring those offering support in a crisis are legally protected should their actions inadvertently cause damage, in “Good Samaritan” fashion. Therefore, in taking a comprehensive approach, national cyber crisis frameworks and response plans should consider how states could offer, but also receive, cyber assistance from outside actors, including other states and industry providers. Using NATO as a platform, allied states are working to operationalize these activities through the development of a virtual cyber incident support capability, which will operate on a voluntary basis and use national assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final aspect, once an effective resilience plan is in place that accounts for all aspects of cyber defense and crisis management, is to ensure that it works in practice via a comprehensive and holistic approach to exercising and training, including national and international cyber exercises as well as meaningful integration of cyber into joint exercises. These exercises, when mimicking a national crisis, benefit from drawing in stakeholders across military and civil communities as well as from a range of relevant national actors, such as critical infrastructure operators and the cybersecurity industry providers that would likely be engaged in a real-world cyber crisis. While care is needed to avoid duplication against existing exercises or training fatigue where a limited set of skilled expertise is constantly refreshed instead of conducting business as usual, exercising should be leveraged to ensure preparedness across a range of aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sustainable-resilience-and-private-sector-engagement&quot;&gt;Sustainable Resilience and Private Sector Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any analysis of Ukraine’s cyber defense activities through 2022 would be incomplete without analyzing the critical role of industry actors, many of whom donated (among other things) licenses, software packages, and infrastructural services. In the immediate run-up to, and early stages of, the invasion in February 2022, Ukraine rapidly ingested a range of private sector and bilateral state assistance in cyberspace. Actors from the private sector proved instrumental in helping Ukraine react rapidly and defend against cyber threats through the provision of cyber threat intelligence, cloud data storage, and a range of cyber defense products including denial of service mitigation services, incident response capabilities, and security software licenses. In the information space, for telecommunications and broader support of digital infrastructure, Starlink’s satellite terminals have been critical in maintaining communications by the Ukrainian military and civilian authorities. Private sector support for Ukraine’s cyber defense efforts has played a significant role in reshaping the conflict. This has been so significant that it has been recognized by the Ukrainian government, to the extent that in May 2022, Google received the first Peace Prize from Ukraine in recognition of the company’s support, which included a significant cybersecurity assistance package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This aspect of direct private sector involvement has prompted a more urgent approach to private-public engagements, with the United States among those claiming to have increased collaboration with industry partners on cybersecurity issues as a direct result of activity in Ukraine. Increased private sector participation, alongside the cyberattack against Viasat, also prompted discussions around private sector actors’ place in a conflict, such when they may be considered legitimate military targets in cyberspace. More broadly, there is an emerging and increasing concern around private sector dependencies and the sustainability of private sector engagement in a crisis, particularly in cases where states may be reliant on industry providers to provide or operate critical infrastructure support. Nowhere is this illustrated more neatly than in the case of SpaceX’s Starlink, a satellite internet service that has been essential in maintaining connectivity for critical services in Ukraine — and the Ukrainian military — since February 2022. When SpaceX announced it was no longer planning to offer the satellites or licenses to Ukraine without cost — having already spent almost $100 million supporting Ukrainian’s internet service — it prompted a scramble in which other actors came forward to sponsor ongoing service delivery. During a dramatic series of public exchanges in autumn, SpaceX highlighted that the company could not “indefinitely” fund Starlink connectivity in Ukraine. While service availability was eventually maintained with external assistance, the loss of these services, which Ukraine has become reliant on during the conflict, could have been devastating to Ukraine’s war effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Starlink may be an extreme example, with few competitors in the market of portable satellite communications technology, the war highlights the sheer number and breadth of actors now enmeshed in the provision of rapid cyber assistance to a state in conflict. Private sector actors cannot afford to give products for free or below cost indefinitely. Ultimately, shareholders have a say, and as more organizations announce their inability to donate services, the limits of this type of ad hoc free support will likely be revealed over time. While Microsoft has announced its support free of charge until the end of 2023, for example, the Telegraph reported that the company likely faced some business impact as a result, turning down new cloud clients in mid-2023 due to capacity constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While private-public cooperation for cyber defense is by no means a novel topic for governments, there is no agreed current market model for private sector actors to sustainably provide cyber assistance in the context of a conflict or where receiving actors cannot necessarily cover the costs involved. Much like the required coherent strategic vision for cyber deterrence discussed in an earlier section, the United Kingdom and its allies will have to face the challenge of market sustainability soon as they look towards Ukraine and beyond. Acknowledging the evolving cyber threat landscape in which we expect governments to continually face cyber crises in the future, stakeholders need market incentives to ensure that they do not end up continually rallying in an ad hoc manner, as in the case of Starlink in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of incentives to encourage private sector actors to provide support to states who may not have the resources to pay them directly. First, encouraging donations through the perspective of norms and in support of democratic values. This admittedly relies on a moral incentive targeting the values and strategic positioning of service provider — but it can be encouraged. When announcing continued support for Ukraine free of charge through 2023, Microsoft referenced their support of “international stability and the protection of fundamental rights across Europe and around the world.” Recognizing that for-profit organizations have different overarching goals from government defense stakeholders, there is nonetheless a path forward for defense stakeholders to harness and shape the way industry increasingly engages with norms. Second, coordinating alternative funding mechanisms that might include ad hoc bilateral assistance from other states. This may involve the creation of an emergency or sustained funding mechanism through which states with greater resources can contribute funds to shore up a state’s cyber defenses, in line with the international resilience-building measures discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A focus exclusively on the first option — appealing to private sector non-financial motivations — is unlikely to succeed in the long term. For the latter option, it is not yet clear what kind of body or group of states might coordinate such a fund, or if this fund is politically feasible given the expectation of future attacks. A sustainable approach will need to include both kinds of incentive to work for everyone involved and ensure adequate market participation in the long term. This is a market challenge greater than any one nation; it will require states to come together to determine an appropriate framework for engagement. Any framework, in addition to accounting for sustainable provision of services in terms of funding, must also clarify the roles and authorities where private sector organizations provide digital or cyber defense services to ensure seamless integration into national defense. In spring 2023, SpaceX acted to restrict the Ukrainian military’s use of Starlink connectivity for drone control, claiming that the organization’s technology was being weaponized by Ukraine in a way not originally intended and at odds with its terms and conditions of service. While private organizations must retain the right to provide their services as they wish, unexpected changes to the service provision mid-conflict are not, putting it lightly, an effective way to engage and build a commercial relationship. Mechanisms coordinating private sector assistance, in times of cyber crisis and broader conflict, must set out clear frameworks for engagement at the start to avoid such ad hoc surprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the driving force for any framework would be to take an active approach to the coordination of assistance. This means setting structures in place so that when nations need to request external industry support during a major cyber incident, mechanisms to arrange this support already exist and can be agile while also accounting for sustainable deployment and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current strategic landscape demonstrates that cyberspace continues to be fertile ground for pushing the boundaries of conflict and raising the level of malicious activity against states beyond what is considered acceptable in the rules-based international order. Cyberspace is increasingly used by state-sponsored actors to conduct malicious cyber activity, where they can achieve asymmetric effects while maintaining plausible deniability and provocatively challenge the rules-based order championed by NATO and like-minded nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contested cyberspace is well on the way to becoming the “new normal,” with a baseline that has incrementally increased over time to the levels of pervasive disruption seen today. State-sponsored cyber operations against critical infrastructure are happening more frequently, and nations must take a proactive stance on cyber’s role in defense. States defending the norms-based order cannot be complacent nor unaware of the “boiling frog” scenario; they must not subconsciously adjust to this new baseline of malicious cyber activity and they must resist becoming more tolerant of their adversaries’ disruptive actions. Instead, policymakers and political leaders must unite at a strategic and political level to present a strategic vision for the rules-based order. For cyberspace, this strategic vision must address deterrence in cyberspace and intolerance to adversarial activity. Second, resilience must remain a priority, particularly for all states struggling to make progress on systemic challenges including resources, capacity-building, and funding. Enhancing resilience means helping all those on whom one depends for overall security. Learning from Ukraine, resilience must also include the ability to adapt quickly in a crisis, with the ability to receive and deliver cyber assistance as required. Finally, there is a future in which cybersecurity providers to Ukraine all withdraw their donated support due to their capacity constraints in a market economy, and this would be hugely disruptive to Ukrainian cyber defense capabilities. The international community needs a model for sustainable private sector provision of assistance — not just for Ukraine, but to be employed in principle wherever a state needs emergency assistance and has funding constraints. The best time to have created such a framework would have been before facing the risks of over-reliance on the private sector in the middle of a difficult conflict. The second-best time is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-issue&quot;&gt;The Issue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to explore the specific methods and approaches that can advance U.S.-China collaboration on matters of shared concern, the project Advancing Collaboration in an Era of Strategic Competition, a joint initiative between CSIS and the Brookings Institution, is examining a series of historical case studies that demonstrate past instances of cooperation among geostrategic rivals. This inaugural case study examines the motivations and mechanisms of joint U.S.-Soviet efforts in smallpox eradication in the 1960s and 1970s. Even during the Cold War, it argues, the two opposing powers found ways to jointly advance the eradication effort thanks to three critical factors: the facilitating role of the World Health Organization (WHO), the fact that smallpox eradication aligned with the individual interests of each superpower, and the ability of health experts and practitioners to work in relative independence of political forces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eradicating a human disease is an enormously complex, daunting task. Of the seven attempts so far, only the campaign against smallpox — certified as eradicated in late 1979 — has succeeded. The story is even more remarkable as the effort was led by two global superpowers engaged in their most pitched competition for the hearts and minds of countries around the world. Yet, even though the Cold War prevented collaboration between the United States and the Soviet Union in its early years, it then became a major driver for smallpox eradication as the two countries sought to engage in practical applications of détente while demonstrating their respective strengths on the world stage. Smallpox eradication represented a common goal that served both countries’ domestic interests in eliminating imported smallpox cases. It also allowed the United States to embrace international cooperation as a counter to reputational damages from the Vietnam War and the Soviet Union to showcase its disease control successes. Further, the program facilitated the rivals’ continued competition for influence in developing countries while pursuing their shared faith in medicine and science as an engine of social and economic progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, without the binding force provided by the international system — in this case, the World Health Organization (WHO) — these impulses could not have been acted upon. As the public health arm of the United Nations system, the WHO provides a forum for multinational consideration of and response to common health threats at the ministerial level and through ongoing exchanges among medical and public health professionals. Further, it facilitates vital connections with local and national leaders and on-the-ground operational support that promotes health service access in the most underserved parts of the world. All of these assets came to bear in the achievement of smallpox eradication — considered one of the greatest public health successes in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the world is very different than it was in the mid-1900s, the story of smallpox eradication provides an inspiring, practical example of how competing world powers can find common ground on common human challenges. Further, it illustrates the invaluable role of international organizations in facilitating cooperation. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and simultaneously confronts new global threats, including climate change and rapidly moving pandemics, human survival depends on universal commitment to international governance mechanisms that can bridge geopolitical rivalries and provide operating structures for effective action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eradication-an-audacious-goal&quot;&gt;Eradication: An Audacious Goal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign against smallpox is the only successful instance of human disease eradication in history. To grasp the magnitude of the feat and the mechanisms required, it is important to understand what is meant by the term eradication, what is involved, and the challenges that have prevented other attempts from succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global disease eradication is defined as the “permanent reduction to zero” of worldwide infections caused by a specific agent “as a result of deliberate efforts.” The goal is not only to relieve humankind from a dreaded disease, but also to create a situation where intervention measures are no longer needed. This both reduces costs and eliminates potential adverse effects associated with disease control, such as rare but sometimes serious reactions to vaccination. For a human disease to be considered eradicable, it must meet specific criteria: it must have easily recognizable symptoms that are diagnosable across all geographies, infections must be limited to and transmitted only by humans, and it must be vaccine preventable or subject to elimination through other means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a handful of human diseases meet the criteria. Since smallpox was eradicated, the International Task Force for Disease Eradication has assessed more than 90 potential infectious diseases and concluded that seven others could be considered candidates: polio, Guinea worm disease, lymphatic filariasis, cysticercosis (tapeworm), mumps, measles, and rubella. (Recently, malaria has also reemerged as a topic, and the WHO has reinstated yaws eradication.) The criteria for an eradicable disease was developed through research and lessons learned from previous efforts. For example, malaria was the focus of intense eradication attempts during the early and mid-1900s, but its transmission via a nonhuman vector (mosquitoes) ultimately led to failure. Earlier attempts aimed at hookworm, yellow fever, and yaws also failed. A campaign to eradicate polio was initiated in 1988 with a hoped-for end date of 2000. Although the effort has reduced worldwide incidence of the disease by 99.9 percent, the program continues today, having now expended more than $18 billion toward the effort. Similarly, a Guinea worm eradication program overseen by the Carter Center has reduced the number of recorded cases to 13 in 2022. So, though most of these campaigns resulted in substantial (albeit sometimes fleeting) reductions in each of the diseases, only the smallpox campaign has been able to reach its ultimate goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although disease experts assert that “in theory if the right tools were available, all infectious diseases would be eradicable,” the endeavor is in fact not only technologically complex, but also in need of significant social, political, and financial commitments. Considerations include ensuring adequate resource mobilization from beginning to end without diverting those needed for other critical health priorities, strong political commitment from all parties, and identification of the disease as a control priority across a broad geography. Educational and advocacy campaigns are a critical part of a successful campaign, as eradication involves high short-term costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eradication requires ensuring that all people everywhere are no longer susceptible to the disease and thus involves reaching previously inaccessible populations in sometimes inhospitable terrain. Eradicators have employed donkeys, helicopters, boats, and motorcycles and traveled through jungles, over mountains, and through swamps. They have overcome civil wars, broken and inadequate equipment, vaccine refusal, and even targeted assassination of staff. Although many efforts face seemingly impossible odds, they also have their advantages. Eradication campaigns offer a clear, winnable objective; galvanize resources and attention for public health; and, if planned correctly, can produce longer-term health infrastructure enhancements. The smallpox eradication campaign, for example, led to the establishment of the WHO’s Expanded Program on Immunization, which strengthens immunization programs in resource-poor countries. Infrastructure used for the polio program has aided in health emergency response and broader disease surveillance, among other contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;superpowers-collaborate-to-eradicate-an-ancient-scourge&quot;&gt;Superpowers Collaborate to Eradicate an Ancient Scourge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smallpox afflicted — and often killed — millions of people throughout history. Historians estimate that as many as 300 million people died as a result of the disease in the twentieth century and millions more were left with deep scarring. An ancient scourge, smallpox was active from at least the fourteenth century BCE. Inoculation efforts against it first began in China as early as the 1500s. Englishman Edward Jenner developed the first vaccine in 1796 based on viral material from cowpox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An initiative for global smallpox eradication was first proposed at the World Health Assembly (WHA), the WHO’s governing body, in 1953. But it wasn’t until Soviet deputy minister of health Viktor Zhdanov brought a resolution in 1958 that the plan was approved. The Soviets saw the program as a way to take their own successful smallpox elimination program to the world stage while also protecting themselves from imported cases from neighboring countries. The proposal also served to push back on what they viewed as excessive U.S. influence at the WHO through advancement of a bold global health program. With its ability to visibly infect all of its victims, its lack of transmission among organisms other than humans, and the advent of modern immunization, smallpox met the criteria of an eradicable disease. Using a quote from Thomas Jefferson (“future nations will know by history only that the loathsome smallpox has existed”), Zhdanov argued that smallpox eradication could be achieved in five years if compulsory vaccinations were initiated in remaining endemic countries. To get the program started, Zhdanov offered 25 million doses of smallpox vaccine annually. The vaccine was freeze-dried — thus heat-stable and usable in a variety of climates without its integrity being compromised — making it a useful tool across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of Zhdanov’s proposal, widespread vaccination had already eliminated smallpox in North America and Europe, but cases were still occurring in South America, Asia, and Africa, and the disease killed two million people worldwide annually. Even countries with the disease largely under control were subject to outbreaks brought in by travelers from endemic countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Soviet proposal was accepted at the WHA, the move toward eradication was slow to get off the ground. The WHO was already deeply involved in a U.S.-supported global malaria eradication program that was not going well and would eventually sputter out. Malaria proved a much harder eradication target, as it involved eliminating large populations of disease-transmitting mosquitoes. Although the advent of the insecticide DDT made the prospect of eradication seem feasible, beating back the insect population to the levels required to eradicate the disease proved enduringly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impeding the establishment of the smallpox program was skepticism among some at the WHO about the feasibility of eradication overall, and of smallpox specifically, and concern for the organization’s reputation as the malaria program faltered. The WHO began studies on smallpox, standardized the vaccine in developing countries, and provided technical assistance, but its Smallpox Eradication Program initially received minimal funding and virtually no staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States initially gave the program short shrift, viewing it as a Soviet initiative and concerned that it would compete with its own pet project: malaria eradication. Yet over time, as its foreign policy goals shifted, it changed its position. In 1967, the United States spearheaded what came to be called the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program, backing it with financial and technical contributions, as well as personnel. With U.S. leadership and staff support from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — and bolstered with more than a billion doses of Soviet vaccine — the intensified program overcame multiple obstacles to record the final case of smallpox in 1977 and achieved official eradication certification in late 1979.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economist Scott Barrett describes smallpox eradication as “one of the greatest achievements of international cooperation — ever.” Although the United States and the Soviet Union drove the program, the WHO created a platform that allowed it to be truly global. Of the $64 million contributed in cash or in kind, $28 million came from 40 countries other than the United States and the Soviet Union, including a sizable allocation from Sweden. The United States provided more than 100 technical staff, but participants also included nationals from 73 different countries who worked closely with leaders and volunteers on the ground. Five countries — the United States, the Soviet Union, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands — produced a step-by-step manual of standard production and testing procedures that ensured an effective vaccine was available worldwide, while researchers in multiple other countries contributed important findings to the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-united-states-long-pursuit-of-disease-eradication&quot;&gt;The United States’ Long Pursuit of Disease Eradication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States had long been perhaps the most ardent supporter of global disease eradication. The earliest campaigns were carried out by the Rockefeller Foundation, aimed at yellow fever and hookworm. Although both efforts failed, the image of saving the world from dreaded diseases remained incredibly attractive, especially as appropriate technologies proliferated in unison with U.S. global power after World War II. In the 1950s, the United States became a major financial and technical supporter of a WHO program to eradicate malaria, the organization’s largest undertaking at the time. The program reflected a U.S. penchant for technological fixes for social and medical problems and also served its geopolitical goals; much of the malaria campaign was focused on Southeast Asia, where the United States wanted to increase its influence as the Cold War progressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the disappointments of malaria eradication, and the concept of eradication falling out of favor in some quarters, public health officials at the CDC were eager to prove themselves internationally and had begun responding to disease outbreaks around the globe. Those forays were supported by the broader U.S. government, reflected in a 1963 statement from President Lyndon B. Johnson: “We have the knowledge to reduce the toll of many diseases,” he said, adding that the country should be using its resources and scientific insights “to avert millions of separate tragedies of needless death and suffering.” The CDC’s interest in confronting health issues worldwide meshed with broader U.S. foreign policy goals to support a remarkably successful CDC smallpox eradication and measles control program in Central and West Africa. Starting in 1967, hundreds of physicians and technical staff from the United States supported African countries’ smallpox vaccination programs — an effort that resulted in the elimination of the disease in 20 countries by 1970 and became the model for the global program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the United States’ abundance of technological innovations — most visible in its space program — youthful idealism, and strong focus on internationalism, the early and mid-1960s were an optimistic and expansive period in U.S. history. Seeking to spread his vision of a U.S. society free of poverty and disease onto the global stage and anxious to bolster the country’s image as the Vietnam War dragged on, President Johnson envisioned a “Global Great Society” — an effort to promote advances in science, technology, and medicine as a cornerstone of worldwide economic development. U.S. support for smallpox eradication offered a relatively inexpensive opportunity to express that impulse. “As long as smallpox exists anywhere in the world, no country is safe from it. This dread disease spreads so rapidly, that even a single case creates the threat of epidemic. It is clear that every nation of the world, whether or not it has experienced smallpox in recent years, has a major stake in a worldwide eradication program,” Johnson said in announcing the program in May 1965. Building on smallpox successes in Africa, the United States offered dedicated funding toward smallpox eradication through the WHO and helped initiate the intensified campaign. The program was led by Donald A. Henderson, who had been instrumental to the U.S. smallpox success in Africa, and who retained his CDC salary while working at the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to aligning with U.S. foreign policy goals, smallpox eradication had appeal domestically. The United States was still spending $15–$20 million a year controlling smallpox with a vaccine that could have severe adverse effects. This meant that though the United States eventually spent $32 million on global eradication, the country still benefited in saved costs of domestic vaccination — and, globally, benefits outweighed costs by a ratio of 400-to-1. The campaign had domestic business appeal through a “buy American” approach and through potentially expanding U.S. markets. Activities funded through the United States Agency for International Development were required to use equipment and tools made in the United States. Additionally, the program supported U.S. aims of nurturing the health and stability of developing countries to create more purchasers of U.S. goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By working the program through an international organization like the WHO, the United States could leverage its investments by attracting those of other nations, operate in potentially hostile areas under the auspices of the largely trusted WHO, and avoid perceptions of overstepping. “To carry out our own foreign policies under the aegis of the United Nations helps America directly, as we then get credit for practicing altruism instead of power politics,” UN ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge said in 1957.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-history-with-smallpox&quot;&gt;Russia’s History with Smallpox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smallpox had long been of particular concern for Russians, who lost millions to the disease throughout history. When an outbreak hit the aristocracy in the late 1700s, Catherine the Great arranged for inoculation of the nobility and championed widespread vaccination among the general population. Although deadly epidemics of the disease continued to occur cyclically, vaccination efforts continued and had a measurable effect: Between 1893 and 1898, smallpox incidence in European Russia was 7.4 per 10,000 people. It dropped to 4.4 per 10,000 by 1913.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the disease remained a major concern at the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917. As a way to show its commitment to preventive healthcare, the Soviet government issued a decree in April 1919 instating compulsory smallpox vaccination for the entire population. The move had multiple motivations, from cultivating a healthy workforce to acting as a method for claiming superiority over czarist governments and capitalist Western countries. The Soviet Union continued improving the smallpox vaccine, including ramping up production of a freeze-dried version and ensuring widespread vaccination. Through these efforts, it eliminated the disease from within its borders by 1936.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking to translate the achievement to a global success — while also wanting to eliminate the hundreds of cases imported yearly from neighbors India and Pakistan — the Soviet Union pushed the WHO to initiate worldwide compulsory vaccinations in remaining endemic countries. Its contributions to the program included research, personnel, and the lion’s share of vaccines used — 1.4 billion vaccine doses between 1958 and 1979.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;smallpox-eradication-and-cold-war-politics&quot;&gt;Smallpox Eradication and Cold War Politics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO ratified its constitution in 1948, just as the Cold War was beginning. The competition between the United States and the Soviet Union for influence among the world’s countries played a major role in the organization’s early years and in smallpox eradication. For example, in protest of what it viewed as disproportionate U.S. influence in the health organization (the United States was then and remains one of the WHO’s largest financial supporters), the Soviet Union and other eastern bloc countries dropped out of the organization in 1949. The nation returned in 1956 as Nikita Khrushchev came to power with a more cooperative international vision that promoted peaceful coexistence and friendly competition, ushering in the period of détente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1958 WHA marked the first Soviet appearance at the governing body since the Soviet Union’s reinstatement. Its global smallpox eradication proposal was a way to emphasize the nation’s reengagement with a bold move that would challenge U.S. influence at the organization and make its own mark on international health. Eager to welcome the Soviet Union back into the fold, delegates accepted the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. investment in international health programs, including smallpox eradication, was also largely driven by self-interest and Cold War politics. Johnson administration officials saw the programs as a way to highlight U.S. technological prowess and win “hearts and minds” in countries vulnerable to possible communist influence. As historians Marcos Cueto, Theodore M. Brown, and Elizabeth Fee suggested, “For U.S. policymakers, health work . . . seemed to provide an extraordinary opportunity to demonstrate the power of American technological expertise; to forge a link between health programs, modernization, and anticommunism; and to develop influence in newly independent developing countries.” As one administration official put it: “I leave aside all soft-spoken questions of humanity and brotherhood. I speak only of hardheaded self-interest. The best breeding place for communism is disease and poverty. If we are going to lead the free world in its fight against the bondage of communism, we have to do something about the health of these poor people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the Cold War rhetoric swirling above them, public health experts generally were left alone to focus on the humanitarian and technical aspects of eradication. Even though there were a variety of potential stress points between the two main supporters of the program, the sides were largely able to work out their differences quietly and effectively. For example, though Soviet leaders initially objected to having an American run the program, they later told director Henderson that they had checked him out and trusted his leadership. Historians credit Henderson’s doggedness and savvy diplomatic skills with keeping the program on track. When it was discovered that some of the Soviet vaccine doses were ineffective, for example, he was able to have quiet conversations with his counterparts in the Soviet Union and facilitate a resolution. When the Soviet Union wanted more of its officials hired onto the program, Henderson went to Moscow to help review candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through approaches fostered and supported at the WHO, even while engaged in a pitched battle for influence across the globe, the Soviet Union and the United States were able to harness their domestic and geopolitical self-interests and their mutual interest in using science and technology to advance human development and produce a remarkable public health achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-the-worlds-public-health-agency&quot;&gt;WHO: The World’s Public Health Agency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO was a critical focal point for smallpox eradication and continues to play an essential role in global health. Understanding the organization’s purpose and structure helps illuminate the mechanisms by which the smallpox campaign advanced, and which continue to help address the world’s most pressing issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the directing and coordinating authority on global health for the UN system, the WHO’s primary purpose is to provide technical support to countries; establish global norms and standards for products and systems, such as pharmaceuticals and laboratory operations; and recognize and coordinate responses to health emergencies throughout the world. The WHO is governed by the WHA, an annual meeting of health ministers from the organization’s member states. Its executive board oversees implementation of WHA decisions, and the WHO secretariat runs day-to-day activities. Further technical support is provided by designated collaborating centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting the organization’s decisionmaking and technical tools are expert advisory panels made up of medical and public health professionals from around the world. These bodies facilitate a global network of professionals who develop relationships with each other independent of their countries’ geopolitics. Other key governance structures include six regional authorities, country offices, and field staff. Officials in these structures foster critical ongoing relationships with country leaders at the national and local levels and support on-the-ground operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smallpox eradication campaign depended on all of the WHO’s assets. Global disease eradication required buy-in from all countries, a commitment that could only be achieved through a UN organization like the WHO. The program required countries that had solid national immunization systems to muster the operational support and resources to eliminate smallpox from within their borders. Through the WHO, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries could provide strategic and technical aid, along with resources and vaccines, to countries that needed it. Other countries stepped up with research and laboratory resources coordinated by the international health organization. The WHO’s regional and country offices pitched in with operational structures and ongoing relationships with local and national leaders that helped countries facilitate widespread vaccination. The campaign benefited from a dedicated and focused staff equipped with the tools needed to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the WHO was able to marshal its resources toward the eradication of smallpox, it often struggles to meet the many expectations placed on it. While its complicated governance structure can get in its way, the organization also suffers from vast underfunding. Although expected to serve as the public health agency for the entire world, its current budget is about the same size as that of a large U.S. hospital and one-quarter that of the CDC. As it has from the beginning, it also inevitably finds itself embroiled in geopolitics, since it caters to the sensitivities of all nations. Recently, for example, as the Covid-19 pandemic spread, WHO staff attempted to pull additional case information from a reticent China while ensuring communications channels with Beijing remained as open as possible. The WHO was required to employ maximum diplomatic skills during the event but was judged to be too conciliatory and unduly positive about China’s Covid-19 response. The United States accused the WHO of being too “China-centric,” eventually leading to a temporary halt in U.S. funding to the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its shortcomings, the WHO has proven indispensable throughout numerous outbreaks and health campaigns. In addition to its role in improving health services worldwide and providing data, support, and guidance in the face of health emergencies, it provides an irreplaceable forum for all countries to discuss common health concerns. While health ministers meet annually at the WHA, medical and public health professionals network regularly through the WHO via expert panels and other forums. Further, WHO regional and country offices provide ongoing support to the world’s poorest countries as they strive to strengthen health services. Under the WHO, experts from more advanced health systems are able to contribute to that effort while largely avoiding geopolitical tensions they would encounter if they acted bilaterally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the United States in particular is a top bilateral contributor to international health, an effort as monumental and global as smallpox eradication could only have been shouldered under the auspices of the international system since it required universal buy-in, drew on the collective resources of a variety of contributors, and relied on an operational structure trusted in most parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smallpox eradication was driven by U.S. and Soviet domestic and geopolitical self-interest and came at a point when both countries were seeking to showcase their scientific and medical prowess, as well as soften their images through international cooperation and humanitarianism. But achieving those goals, especially during the Cold War, would have been impossible without the international forum and coordinating unit provided by the WHO. As the historian Erez Manela has argued, “bridging the global East-West and North-South divides was crucial for the success of the [Smallpox Eradication Program], and here the WHO served as an indispensable forum. It provided an institutional framework for conceiving of disease control as a global problem, for coordinating a global campaign, and no less important, for taking credit for success that neither superpower would have wanted to cede to the other.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, of all the factors that came together to produce this monumental public health achievement, the WHO is still cited as the most critical factor. As the 1,460-page WHO-issued history of smallpox eradication argues: “The first and most important [factor for success] was the existence of an international organization through which a collective international policy could be expressed and which could call on governments and individuals in fostering and coordinating activities directed towards a common purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-international-system-is-central-to-tackling-global-challenges&quot;&gt;The International System Is Central to Tackling Global Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the WHO, and despite substantial bipolar global tensions, the world was able to come together to rid humankind of a deadly disease. The success was driven in large part by the United States’ and the Soviet Union’s ability to act on their domestic and geopolitical self-interests through the international system. The WHO served as a critical coordinating unit where countries could come together to provide collaborative leadership, strategic and technical guidance, resources, and operational support. Under the WHO brand, an international corps of health professionals was able to work toward a common goal in countries around the world, largely free from macropolitical forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the WHO often struggles with its complex remit, it continues to serve as an irreplaceable forum in an increasingly interconnected and complex world. Yet, as a member state organization with no enforcement power, the WHO is only as strong as the financing and cooperative commitments it receives from national governments. Several efforts are currently under way to improve the WHO’s independence and strengthen country commitments to transparency and adherence to obligations related to global health security. These efforts must also navigate the bilateral dynamics between the United States and China within the WHO, as the politics of great power competition impact each country’s engagement with the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the ultimate outcome of these efforts is uncertain, the health and economies of all countries depend on improved cooperation as increased population density, more animal-human contact, global travel, and climate change are resulting in a greater number of disease outbreaks and dangerous levels of environmental degradation. The scale and universality of these cross-border existential threats will require a renewed commitment to multilateral governance through the international system. Smallpox eradication can be a model as the world struggles to forge cooperative mechanisms to address today’s common challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

It is understudied and underutilised compared to both UK-France and Franco-German cooperation.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the relationship attracted more attention, and the intergovernmental relations have intensified after Brexit. However, despite this intensification, the political drivers, alongside differing threat perceptions and strategic cultures, have thus far been insufficient to deepen the relationship in a way that would match the potential for cooperation between these two leading European countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany are the European top defence spenders and top supporters of Ukraine in military, economic and humanitarian assistance. They have significant diplomatic, defence and security influence, and cooperation would maximise this influence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Enhanced cooperation would also signal that the UK and Germany are able to work together for the benefit of Europe and maintain unity through the challenges ahead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Substantial differences between the respective outlook and approaches of the UK and Germany on defence and security are unlikely to be resolved but can be mitigated in certain areas with continued pragmatism and compromise.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s large-scale reinvasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 was an inflection point for European security. It has prompted a refresh of the UK’s 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy (IR2021), which was published on 13 March 2023 as the Integrated Review Refresh policy paper (IRR2023), and a refresh of its Defence Command Paper (DCP), which will be published in June 2023. Germany is also currently developing its first ever National Security Strategy (NSS), at a time when Ukraine has underlined the fundamental importance of allies and alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This policy paper argues that the transformative effect of the war in Ukraine has made enhanced UK-German defence and security, and foreign policy cooperation more attractive, viable, and necessary, which would benefit European security; and moreover, that this period of joint policy development is the ideal moment to develop a more structural relationship. This shared agenda should be developed with Transatlanticism and Euro-Atlantic security at its core and with helping to lead the development of a European pillar of NATO as a key objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;KEY FINDINGS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ukraine war has transformed European Security, and Russia will continue to be the defining security challenge to 2030. There is now a window of opportunity to lock in structured and planned cooperation – focussed on helping to lead a European Pillar of NATO, rather than the ad hoc and transactional approach that has characterised the current relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK and Germany are currently the top two European defence spenders and top two supporters of Ukraine in volume of military, economic and humanitarian assistance. London and Berlin have significant diplomatic, defence and security influence, and thus cooperation on any initiative would maximise this influence and provide a greater chance of its being agreed. It would also signal to allies as well as adversaries that the UK and Germany are able to work together for the benefit of Europe and maintain unity through the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has helped create practical areas for post-Brexit UK-EU defence and security cooperation, which include sanctions and military mobility. These activities, coupled with the agreement of the Windsor Framework, has demonstrated what pragmatism can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite an overall improvement of UK-European relations, there remain substantial differences between the respective outlook and approaches of the UK and Germany on defence and security. These are unlikely to be resolved but can be mitigated in certain areas with continued pragmatism and compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;European defence industry is similarly being transformed by the war in Ukraine as demand signals increase and business models adapt to a new security environment. UK and German defence industries are well placed to adapt, but political and structural differences between the UK and Germany are unlikely to provide a step change in cooperation without a corresponding high-level political statement of intent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extant 2021 UK-German Joint Declaration is accepted as a comprehensive baseline for future cooperation; this paper provides additional recommendations that could further enhance the relationship. These 19 recommendations are provided in the table below by category – Political, Policy, Operational, and Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing – which are also provided throughout the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/h2HR8V3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was initiated within the framework of the annual &lt;strong&gt;FES-RUSI British-German Dialogue on Defence and Security Policies&lt;/strong&gt;. Official and expert participants agreed that there was considerable scope to enhance the UK-German defence and security relationship in the context of the war in Ukraine and the early days following the Chancellor’s Zeitenwende speech. What was more uncertain was the level of ambition on both sides and identifying the practical areas for cooperation that would produce the most benefit. The discussions helped frame the overarching research questions that this policy paper seeks to answer. The vision timeframe of 2030 was selected to match those of the UK’s IR2021 and IRR2023, NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept, and the EU’s 2022 Strategic Compass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RUSI-FES (London) project objectives were to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify areas for enhanced defence and security cooperation to promote mutual benefits between the UK and Germany and strengthen wider European collective security;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify political opportunities and constraints for enhanced UK-German defence and security cooperation, and how these might be addressed; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build a road map of prioritised and actionable areas for enhanced UK-German defence and security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve these, the project convened two expert-led joint workshops to consider, respectively, the UK-German relationship within the European security architecture, and UK-German defence industrial cooperation. These workshops provided the foundation material for a research visit to Brussels to understand the EU context. These research activities were augmented by consultations with current and former UK and German officials and the expert community in both countries. Finally, desk-based research was conducted on primary sources such as speeches, government statements and policy documents, alongside extensive media reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;STRUCTURE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is structured in four chapters. The first chapter baselines the current UK-German relationship, deconstructs the extant vision of the June 2021 UK-German Joint Declaration, and develops an updated and more specific vision to 2030. Chapter 2 explains how the war in Ukraine has created more favourable conditions to significantly enhance UK-German defence and security cooperation and outlines the associated benefits. Chapter 3 considers defence, security, and foreign policy cooperation, focusing on first, Russia and the Euro-Atlantic, and second, China and the Indo-Pacific, in line with the priorities established by the Joint Declaration. Chapter 4 identifies opportunities for operational cooperation, including those with the defence industry. Recommendations are provided throughout the paper and a summary table is provided in this Executive Summary. These recommendations are categorised as: Political, Policy, Operational, or Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-one&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHAPTER ONE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-vision-for-uk-german-defence-and-security-cooperation&quot;&gt;A VISION FOR UK-GERMAN DEFENCE AND SECURITY COOPERATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first chapter provides an overview of the contemporary UK-German defence and security relationship and its recent developments. It considers the 2021 Joint Declaration vision and proposes an enhanced vision for cooperation to 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-growing-relationship&quot;&gt;A GROWING RELATIONSHIP&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intellectual underpinnings of the Zeitenwende can be traced back to February 2014. Then Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier (now President of Germany) delivered a speech at the 50th Munich Security Conference in which he declared that Germany must be “ready for earlier, more decisive and more substantive engagement in the foreign and security policy sphere” and assume more responsibility. Subsequently referred to as the “Munich Consensus”, it signalled a change in mentality at the very top of government, especially between then President Joachim Gauck and then Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany then began to do more. Having already deployed soldiers to Mali in 2013, in 2015 the Bundeswehr joined anti-ISIS operations in Syria and Iraq, became the European colead of the “Normandy Format” which sought to mediate the growing Russia-Ukraine conflict and, in 2016, became the framework nation for NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) in Lithuania. While these developments demonstrated increased, if modest, operational activity, core Germany foreign policy towards Russia and energy security endured. Aylin Matlé suggests less of a change than first appears and that “it is difficult to discern a sound strategy behind all these actions and commitments – unless assuming more responsibility is a strategy in and of itself”. At the UK-hosted NATO Wales Summit later in 2014, Germany also agreed to meet the NATO two per cent GDP Defence Investment Pledge by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As German activity increased, the UK 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) declared that “We will work to intensify our security and defence relationship with Germany”. This statement elevated the UK-German relationship to “Tier 1” status alongside the US and France, and this language was mirrored in the 2016 German Defence White Paper which promoted “the security partnership with the United Kingdom, which has a long tradition and which we aim to further expand in all areas of common interest”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brexit vote in 2016 and the UK’s leaving the EU in 2020 required a reconsideration of the two countries’ intergovernmental relationship during a period of intensely strained political ties due to the UK decision and approach. In October 2018, a Joint vision Statement was signed by the countries’ respective Defence Ministers to commit to stronger defence cooperation, including retaining a permanent UK military presence in Germany, which is the extant framework for bilateral defence cooperation. This statement was agreed in 2016 but the signing was delayed for two years due to the political consequences of the Brexit process. The IR2021 namechecks Germany, alongside France and the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) with the ambition to “improve interoperability with Euro-Atlantic allies”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2021 the UK-German Joint Declaration was signed, which committed to holding an annual Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue on “all matters of foreign policy and international affairs”. The first Strategic Dialogue was held on 5 January 2023 with support for Ukraine, energy security, and climate change the main agenda items. The German Foreign Minister spoke of the desire to “further intensify” the relationship. The UK Labour Party also expressed its intent that a defence partnership, or Partnerschaft, could be agreed between the two countries in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, over the last decade there has been a stronger desire for cooperation and more common ground identified, yet practical activity has remained modest – compared to the potential – and largely ad hoc and opportunistic where it has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-1--political&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 1 – Political&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should develop a strategic approach to bilateral cooperation, instead of the ad hoc approach that has characterised the past relationship, by setting clear mutual goals and establishing the right mechanisms and processes for delivery, managed through the UK-German Strategic Dialogue or a more ambitious future agreement.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE 2021 UK-GERMAN JOINT DECLARATION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 UK-German Joint Declaration outlines a “shared strategic vision” across four foreign and security policy priorities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Transatlantic relationship;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China and the Indo-Pacific; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Climate change and biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the priorities are right, the Joint Declaration is too comprehensive and broad to provide specific measures for intensified cooperation. It is most detailed on foreign policy, covering all global regions with high-level ambition statements, rather than concrete ideas on how to achieve them. Thematically, it is similarly general, referring to a wide range of security issues without any prioritisation. Moreover, it already feels dated in a post-Ukraine security environment, even referencing the Normandy Format and Minsk Process to achieve stability and security within Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-2--policy&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 2 – Policy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should update the 2021 Joint Declaration following the publication of the UK IRR2023 and German NSS to provide a shared vision on the measures necessary to strengthen European defence and security and how best to ensure long-term support for Ukraine.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-3--political&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 3 – Political&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Extend the annual Strategic Dialogue from Foreign Ministers only, so as to include Defence Ministers as a “2+2” format, to better reflect the defence policy orientation of the Zeitenwende and the UK’s contribution to the defence of the Euro-Atlantic area.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This should be accompanied by regular dialogues between the Prime Minister and Chancellor to set the level of ambition and maintain political momentum, including official government-to-government consultations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE UK AND GERMANY ARE MORE ALIKE THAN THEY REALISE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK-German relationship is an “Alliance of values”, founded in the principles of the UN Charter, a strong belief in the value of a Western-orientated international system, and a recognition that each country has benefitted greatly from it. Transatlanticism and NATO are at the core of their respective defence policies and strategic cultures, with Germany’s EU membership also of critical importance. The UK and Germany are the two leading European defence spenders and are also the leading European suppliers of military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. They each possess strong domestic defence industries of strategic importance and there are multiple advanced defence industrial relationships, such as the Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL) joint venture, which demonstrates how a highly capable structure can be quickly created when the need arises. The intergovernmental relationship is well complemented by other non-governmental fora, such as the annual Königswinter Conference (since 1950) and the specific Defence Königswinter Conference (since 2010).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong ties exist between the two countries, exemplified by His Majesty the King’s first state visit to Germany; in addition, on 30 March 2023, he became the first British monarch to address the Bundestag, speaking in German, which was a strong signal of British-German friendship. Moreover, following the first Strategic Dialogue, the UK-Germany Cultural Commission met for the first time in 30 years, an event which highlights the strength of the wider relationship outside of defence and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIMITING FACTORS AND STRATEGIC CULTURE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structurally, the principal differences in defence and security are that the UK is a nuclear weapons power – with bipartisan commitment to the UK’s independent nuclear deterrent – and has permanent membership (P5) in the UN Security Council (UNSC), while supporting a future permanent seat for Germany, and the UK is no longer a member of the EU and its security apparatus. There are also fundamental differences in strategic culture, and prior to the Ukraine war, differing threat perceptions regarding Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple volumes of works dedicated to explaining German post-war strategic culture development and how it was shaped by its traumatic experience of nationalism and militarism. It evolved a culture which has been characterised by a strong preference for soft power and a rejection of hard power and unilateralism, a belief in trade as the primary basis for promoting positive external relations, and a lack of confidence in external security policy where the military instrument is required. Moreover, the post-war political and electoral system was designed specifically to favour consensus, which has inhibited controversial policy choices and translated into an enduring strong preference for operating multilaterally in international relations, with the Bundeswehr as a “parliamentary army”, always requiring mission approval from the Bundestag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But public attitudes have been changing. The traditional aversion to hard power and the use of force has gradually reduced as the Bundeswehr has increasingly been deployed, especially outside of Europe, albeit on modest missions, as the external environment has grown more hostile. However, this aversion still remains high, with 51 per cent opposing military operations (down from 65 per cent in 2019) and 50 per cent rejecting increases in military spending. The war in Ukraine has had an immediate impact, with high levels of support for the Zeitenwende vision and continuing support to Ukraine, despite the direct economic costs to Germany and its citizens. Indeed, the societal and cultural change required in Germany is critical to realising a true Zeitenwende, whereby simply allocating more money for defence is not the answer and will not deliver or sustain a transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast with Germany’s preference for multilateralism and collective solutions, the UK has always preferred a more flexible approach, combining multilateral (through NATO mainly, but with a strong commitment to the UN), through minilateral (5 Eyes, JEF, etc) and through bilateral defence engagement, primarily with the US. When these options do not meet UK objectives, it is comfortable operating in coalitions of the willing, including operations involving the use of force. As the UK has gradually orientated toward operating in a world with more acute great power competition, it has continued to accept that effective foreign policy needs an active defence component, demonstrated by the UK approach to both Iraq and Afghanistan, and most recently exemplified by significant military support to Ukraine and its European allies and partners, and its enhanced military engagement within the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These embedded differences do not necessarily prevent cooperation. Compromises will be required on both sides to unlock enhanced cooperation. Indeed, the key to a successful UK-German partnership will be predicated on reconciling or mitigating these essential differences by unifying around a common aim. Coalescing around strengthening Euro-Atlantic security and support for Ukraine will also gradually make these differences less significant. Moreover, enhanced UK German cooperation could also prevent the fragmentation of European security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Initially it might seem counterproductive, or even contradictory, to promote deeper cooperation between two countries with diverging perspectives on strategic culture and European integration. Yet it is exactly because of these differences that Berlin and London should strengthen their relationship. At a time of change across the Atlantic and within Europe, especially with the ongoing Brexit negotiations, it is essential that Germany and the United Kingdom prevent divergences from growing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has made this even more necessary and the need is only going to grow stronger as the war continues. Moreover, the primacy of NATO is the most significant entry point for enhancing the relationship and the institution where the two countries could add the most value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AN UPDATED JOINT 2030 VISION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes that the UK and Germany, as leading European defence and security actors with shared values and security challenges, should commit to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-the-war-in-ukraine-makes-enhanced-uk-german-defence-and-security-cooperation-more-viable-necessary-and-beneficial&quot;&gt;WHY THE WAR IN UKRAINE MAKES ENHANCED UK-GERMAN DEFENCE AND SECURITY COOPERATION MORE VIABLE, NECESSARY, AND BENEFICIAL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter argues that the war in Ukraine and the security challenges it has unleashed have created strong drivers to invest in the UK-German defence and security relationship. It articulates why enhanced defence and security cooperation is beneficial for both countries and for wider Euro-Atlantic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-war-in-ukraine-and-the-transformation-of-european-security&quot;&gt;THE WAR IN UKRAINE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF EUROPEAN SECURITY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is transformational for European security and Russia will remain the defining challenge for the remainder of the decade. The UK and Germany are second and third respectively in military, humanitarian, and financial assistance to Ukraine. If Germany’s share of EU support is included, then it ranks second to the US overall. The UK has already committed to match the 2022 support of 2.3 billion pounds in assistance in 2023 and German support could significantly ramp up this year with more funding requested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war has already had a significant impact on the security environment and will likely be the primary driver of transformation for the remaining decade. Within one year it has:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardened NATO defence postures, driven Alliance transformation, and solidified a near unanimous view of the threat posed by Russia;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Produced structural changes, with Finland joining NATO and Sweden hoping to be not too far behind, and Denmark having removed its EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) opt-out through a referendum;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shifted Europe’s politico-military centre of gravity eastward, with Warsaw, rather than Berlin, London or Paris, becoming a focal point. US President Biden has visited twice within a year, and given a major speech to mark the anniversary of the invasion. When support to Ukraine is measured as a percentage of GDP, the Baltics come out on top; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Significantly increased defence expenditure and investment, especially in Germany, France, and Poland, to levels seen at the end of the Cold War, which has changed defence industry business models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war makes UK-German defence and security cooperation more viable and necessary for four principal reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Zeitenwende vision unlocks broader and deeper opportunities for defence and security cooperation than have previously been viable;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UK and German threat perceptions are in greater alignment and the war has reaffirmed the importance of alliances, allies, and the need for greater cooperation;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this transformational moment is mismanaged, there is a risk that European security will fragment, which would be against UK and German interests and therefore it provides a strong incentive to jointly mitigate this risk. Enhanced UK-Germany defence and security cooperation would send a strong signal to allies and adversaries alike about the importance of Euro-Atlantic unity in the face of growing threats; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A poor global economic outlook and the requirement for defence modernisation and increased stockpiling creates strong drivers to realise long-term economic efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-4--political-and-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 4 – Political and Policy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should explore the potential for and content of a bilateral Treaty-based defence and security relationship, consistent with NATO obligations and transparent to EU security structures, to realise the current untapped potential that such an agreement could deliver. This agreement should build on work already undertaken through UK and German leadership of their respective Framework Nations Concepts and should focus on increasing European burden sharing and enhancing readiness of forces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its objectives should include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhanced cooperation on Northern European security;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing European burden sharing to shape a European pillar of NATO;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing further effectiveness and interoperability, with the principle of complementarity and specialisation; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanding defence industry cooperation and developing cooperative equipment programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-zeitenwende&quot;&gt;THE ZEITENWENDE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The powerful Zeitenwende speech of 27 February 2022 fundamentally accelerated the process of change which had begun with the Munich consensus and marked a point of no return. In the speech, the Chancellor committed to a dual funding settlement of first, a 100 billion euro special defence fund for long-term military projects, outside of the regular budgetary process and, second, meeting the NATO two per cent defence spending target by fiscal year 2022–2023, which in any case will not be met. These announcements complemented other decisions that month to halt the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, exclude Russia from the SWIFT global financial transaction service, rapidly diversify away from Russian oil and gas imports, and approve the delivery of lethal aid to Ukraine, which together marked a seismic shift in Germany’s geopolitical position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just one year, Berlin has progressed from promising 5,000 helmets to suppling MBTs, artillery, and air defence systems to Ukraine. The establishment of the 100 billion euro special fund also required changes to the Constitution – an action that the chancellor described as “the starkest change in German security policy since the establishment of the Bundeswehr in 1955”. The criticism of Germany regarding the implementation of its strategic shift has been fierce at times, but there are deep cultural sensitivities towards defence and security that still exist in Germany which partners need to understand and need to appreciate the substantial steps that have already been taken. Germany is currently undergoing significant change in many policy fields, with the Bundeswehr and defence being the most difficult area to change, requiring adequate time for involved departments to prepare for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much of the criticism has been unjustified, 15 months after the Chancellor’s speech, much of the actual scope of the Zeitenwende remains to be clarified beyond the financial commitments. There is also debate about the significance of the announced reforms, with some in the analytical community arguing that real change has yet to begin, and that shifts in energy security have far exceeded steps toward military modernisation. There is also a widespread concern that the sense of urgency and political momentum for a transformative change might already be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has also become clear since the February speech is that, while more money helps, in view of the starting point for German defence it is insufficient to enact the change demanded. To be sustained and enduring, any change needs to ensure far-reaching shifts in German strategic culture – something which Chancellor Scholz explicitly acknowledges in his Global Zeitenwende essay. Without such change, practical reforms are difficult to drive through. Thus, while the new Defence Minister is credited with bringing the required purpose and energy to his department, some observers argue that the Bundeswehr is actually in worse shape one year after the Zeitenwende speech, as the 100 billion euro fund is yet to make an impact. Moreover, the Defence Minister has already requested an additional 10 billion euros for the regular defence budget in 2024 but faces difficulties in gaining agreement from the FDP Finance minister Christian Linder. Again, the complexity of overhauling the Bundeswehr, reforming procurement, and absorbing new funds while at the same time supporting Ukraine is a significant challenge and such cultural changes cannot be made overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Zeitenwende approach still developing, there are opportunities for allies and partners to shape its future and to assist Germany in accelerating this process. The UK is supportive of the Zeitenwende vision, and should offer support where necessary to internationalise it as it would obviously strengthen European security, but the UK remains unconvinced about its delivery, especially over the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-mutual-relationship-with-the-us&quot;&gt;THE MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important bilateral relationship for both the UK and Germany is with the US, and both have a transatlantic security outlook. Their mutual strategic objective is to keep the US as engaged as possible in European security. This synergy should be fundamental for enhanced cooperation as initiatives that mutually support this goal will be well supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A longstanding US request of partners has been to take on more responsibility, and the issue of burden sharing within NATO has been a perennial problem for Euro-Atlantic security since the end of the Cold War. The war in Ukraine, coming just 6 months after European doubts regarding US leadership after the fall of Kabul, has highlighted the fundamental role the US plays in European security, evidenced by the pace and scale of US support to Ukraine. The 2022 US National Defense Strategy prioritises the “pacing challenge” of China in the Indo-Pacific over the Russian challenge to Europe. Therefore, now more than ever, the US needs European countries to step up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With London and Berlin acutely aware of the possibility of US policy changes, following the 2024 US Presidential election, it is in their mutual interest to mitigate any possible future unity challenges between the US and Europe by preparing now. The UK and Germany are already committed to increasing European burden sharing and capabilities, within a NATO context, through leadership of their respective NATO Framework Nations. Yet, with a worsening security environment there is considerable scope for expanding the Framework Nation approach and developing European capabilities. Indeed, combined, the UK and Germany already have experience and are best placed to provide the required leadership and set a vision and level of ambition to other European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-mutual-relationship-with-france&quot;&gt;THE MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH FRANCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strengthening of the UK-German relationship must consider how it might impact existing relationships with France. Moreover, strengthening the UK-German relationship does not serve as a replacement for the one which they both enjoy with France. The two other sides of the “E3 triangle” are well established and bolstered by bilateral treaties. The UK-France relationship is governed by the Lancaster House Treaties of 2010. These treaties are substantial and cover a broad range of security areas, including nuclear and the establishment of the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Franco-German relationship is governed by the enduring Élysée Treaty, which celebrated its 60th birthday on 22 January 2023, with a summit that committed to enhancing Franco-German and European security and defence cooperation, particularly on closer EU-NATO cooperation and capability development. This relationship was reinforced with the 2020 Treaty of Aachen on Franco-German Cooperation and Integration, which committed to deeper cooperation in foreign, security and defence policy including strengthening the ability for Europe to act autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both relationships are structurally strong, they are vulnerable to the political weather. Brexit, and then the September 2021 Australia-UK-US “AUKUS” defence partnership, which undercut the French defence industry, has damaged the UK-France relationship. However, there have been recent positive developments with the first UK-France Summit since 2018 on 10 March 2023, which included deepening defence and security ties in all domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been mounting Franco-German disagreements over a hydrogen pipeline from the Iberian Peninsula to Central Europe and a unilateral German 200 billion euro energy aid package, which contributed to an October 2022 Summit being cancelled at short notice. Defence cooperation is also under strain with reports that the Franco-German Future Combat Air System (FCAS) and Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) programmes are both experiencing trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the UK and Germany have Brexit legacy complications to cooperation, which appear to be fading with the formal adoption of the Windsor Framework. Moreover, support to Ukraine has brought the UK, Germany, and France closer together and has provided a long-term mutual objective for defence and security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-three&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHAPTER THREE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-vision-for-uk-german-defence-and-security-cooperation-1&quot;&gt;A VISION FOR UK-GERMAN DEFENCE AND SECURITY COOPERATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter considers options for enhanced UK-German foreign, defence and security policy cooperation. It focusses heavily on Euro-Atlantic cooperation based on the 2030 timeframe of the roadmap and the priorities established by the Joint Declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;euro-atlantic-security-and-the-threat-from-russia&quot;&gt;EURO-ATLANTIC SECURITY AND THE THREAT FROM RUSSIA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK was already well attuned to the Russian threat, notably because of Russia’s use of chemical weapons within the UK in Salisbury in 2018, which was called out explicitly in the IR2021. Despite the Russia challenge being well analysed in the 2016 White Paper, many German politicians and policymakers did not think that the war would happen, certainly not at the scale that was unleashed on 24 February 2022. The German leadership was confronted for the first time with the brutality and proximity of the Russian threat and the new government has had to manage a steep learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-primacy-of-nato-for-european-security&quot;&gt;THE PRIMACY OF NATO FOR EUROPEAN SECURITY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Joint Declaration is unequivocal to the shared importance of the transatlantic alliance, stating that “NATO is the cornerstone of Euro-Atlantic security. It remains the bedrock of our collective defence. We recognise the importance of a stronger and more capable European contribution to this. We remain jointly committed to NATO-EU cooperation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Joint Declaration was signed, NATO’s response to the war in Ukraine and Russian aggression was enshrined in the 2022 Strategic Concept, which significantly hardened its defence and deterrence posture to “defend every inch of NATO territory”. There was close coordination between London and Berlin in strengthening the eFP to deploy a Brigade headquarters in their respective multinational battlegroups (Estonia and Lithuania) and to scale to that echelon quickly if the threat dictates. While the Baltic states had requested Divisions, which the UK and Germany cannot currently credibly field, this agreement seems acceptable to them and allows the UK and Germany the necessary time to improve readiness of their own forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO is also developing an ambitious New Force Model with more substantial forces at much higher readiness. Germany was the first to commit forces publicly, including an armoured division, while the UK has also committed significant forces. The UK and Germany are also framework nations for NATO’s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (vJTF), which Germany is leading in 2023, before handing it over to the UK for 2024. The 2021 DCP commits to investing in existing UK storage facilities in Germany to increase readiness and recognises this as a critical location for the forward deployment of UK forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-5--policy&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 5 – Policy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should lead by example and, further to the commitment of initial forces to NATO’s New Force Model, they should jointly develop and lead alliance readiness initiatives to help correct problems within their own forces and incentivise other allies to invest in and prioritise readiness. Such a common initiative would strengthen European Security by making a European pillar of NATO more credible and build trust amongst allies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-6--dialogue-and-knowledge-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 6 – Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Germany should offer positions for UK liaison officers for the 2023 vJTF rotation to help support UK planning and ensure a smooth handover for 2024. This should then be institutionalised for further rotations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Germany also lead separate NATO Framework Nations Concepts (FNCs), which were championed by Germany in 2014 to increase the breadth and depth of European NATO capabilities. The German Framework Nation largely focusses on capability development through a “coherent capability package”. In contrast, the UK contribution, through the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) is an operational framework that has significantly increased its activity in response to the Ukraine war. While the benefit and value of JEF is well understood by its members, there is a scepticism by some of its non-members, including Germany. Our research suggests that this scepticism stems from a lack of understanding about the JEF and its development, rather than an inherent dislike for the framework. It would be advantageous to the security of Northern Europe for Germany to be more closely aligned with the JEF, especially as Germany leads the eFP battlegroup in Lithuania and has highly integrated land forces with the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-7--dialogue-and-knowledge-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 7 – Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK should better communicate the JEF and its likely future development to German and other non-member audiences. This should include an offer to host German liaison officers at the JEF operational headquarters&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could support the use of JEF + Germany formats and initiatives (and +Poland), such as the physical and cyber protection of critical national infrastructure in the North and Baltic Seas, which has emerged as a common vital interest. Germany is a central player in Northern Europe – the UK’s Euro-Atlantic priority – and the Baltic Sea in particular, especially for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and operations. Moreover, following the Nordstream 1 and 2 pipeline attacks, the need to protect critical national infrastructure in the region has been elevated, for which the UK has procured two multi-role Ocean Surveillance ships to be in service by 2023. Germany has ordered the P8A Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) which the UK and Norway both operate and is an area where the three countries have significant interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-8--operational&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 8 – Operational&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK should invite Germany to join its trilateral agreement on P8 Poseidon MPA with the US and Norway to increase availability and sustainability of ISR in the North Atlantic, High North and Baltic Sea region and provide more continuous coverage for each sub-region.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE UK AND EU&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third paragraph of the 2021 Joint Declaration affirms the unshakeable German commitment to the EU – “For Germany, its membership of the European Union remains a key reference point and it supports cooperation between the EU and the UK” and it will ensure the “highest possible level of transparency” regarding bilateral undertakings with the UK. Therefore, any UK-Germany bilateral cooperation is heavily dependent on good UK-EU relations which are at a post-Brexit high following the adoption of the Windsor Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has already strengthened the potential for future UK EU defence and security cooperation for several reasons. First, this has been accomplished through practical cooperation on Russian sanctions. Second, this is further aided by the common goal of support for Ukraine which the EU has conducted through the European Peace Facility. Third, the UK has now joined the EU Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) project on Military Mobility, which opens up the possibility of joining other projects. Finally, the war has helped to clarify the division of labour between the EU and NATO, through their third Joint Declaration, which signalled less competition and more cooperation and complementarity with each other. These have already led to discussions on further UK-EU defence cooperation, including counter terrorism and cyber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer UK-EU ties will require balance and concessions for both the UK and Germany. Germany wants a close relationship with the UK, but also wants to strengthen the CSDP to move towards greater strategic sovereignty. This might require accommodating the UK preference for bilateralism and ad hoc cooperation, in contrast to German and EU strategic culture. In turn, the UK will likely have to accept and foster more formal and institutional links with the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHINA AND THE INDO-PACIFIC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Europe, the direct threat that Russia currently poses to the Euro-Atlantic is the highest priority, but the importance of China and the Indo-Pacific will only grow throughout the remainder of the decade, especially for defence policy. China has achieved 28 consecutive years of military growth – the longest uninterrupted period of spending growth in the SIPRI military expenditure database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little European consensus on China, as the approach must balance economic and trade interests with the harder defence and security policy realities. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have exposed the risk of being heavily reliant on authoritarian regimes for raw materials and supply chains. This balance will be difficult to manage by reducing economic dependencies and risk (China is Germany’s largest trading partner and the EU’s second largest) while also cooperating more on issues such as climate change. This lack of consensus was highlighted during President Macron’s April 2024 state visit to Beijing, alongside EU Commission President Ursula von Der Leyen, which received heavy transatlantic criticism for comments on his perceived European view on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German government coalition agreement committed to develop a China strategy, to be adopted imminently, which is likely to follow a harder line on China, especially over “massive human rights violations”. Not only is this an opportunity to reconcile policy differences within the coalition and influence EU policy, with a desire to Europeanise its own policy, but also to establish concrete priorities. Both Chancellor Scholz and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock have recently visited Beijing, with both taking a tougher stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK IRR2023 describes China as an “epoch-defining challenge” and Foreign Secretary James Cleverly set out three pillars of UK policy: to strengthen UK national security protections where threatened; to deepen cooperation and strengthen alignment with partners in the Indo-Pacific and globally; and to engage directly with China, bilaterally and multilaterally, to maintain relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current UK and German approaches show signs of pragmatism, are consistent with the 2021 Joint Declaration, and develop synergies, especially Pillar Two of the UK approach. With development ongoing, it is unlikely that there will be immediate substantial areas of cooperation. However, an increase in dialogue can help develop those strategies and create greater synergies, especially as the UK and German positions are closer than those of France at present; moreover, having a closer position between two leading European nations will influence a more coherent European position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maritime-cooperation-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;MARITIME COOPERATION IN THE INDO-PACIFIC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Germany, alongside the Netherlands and France, are the only European countries to have developed Indo-Pacific strategies, in addition to the EU as a whole. The IRR2023 designated the Indo-Pacific as the second geographic priority but noted that the prosperity and security of the region and the Euro-Atlantic were inextricably linked. Moreover, it also noted that the Indo-Pacific “tilt” of the IR2021 was now complete and achieved through largely non-military means. In September 2020, Germany published its Policy Guidelines for the Indo-Pacific Region which aimed to strengthen strategic and security policy partnerships and cooperate in tackling human-induced climate change and diversifying and strengthening economic ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European military cooperation within the Indo-Pacific, thus far, has been ad hoc and transactional. Moreover, Indo-Pacific partners have limited capacity to absorb increased and uncoordinated European deployments. In 2021, the UK sent a Carrier Strike Group (CSG) to the region with a Dutch escort frigate. At the same time, Germany deployed the Bayern frigate for a solo tour, to support its international obligations and demonstrate that it is a reliable partner in the world. Unlike the UK and France, Germany does not have the history or the territorial assets to support a more ambitious deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IR2021 wanted to “look for ways to work more closely with European partners, including France and Germany” and increased naval deployments to the Indo-Pacific would add value bilaterally and for Europe more broadly. The UK and France, at the March 2023 summit, agreed “to coordinate their carrier deployments to provide complementary and more persistent European presence in regions of shared interest”. Closer cooperation here would allow Germany to participate in a region of growing importance more actively and enhance power projection nationally and add to a significant European presence, in line with the 2021 EU Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover, as the majority of the 100 billion euro special fund will be absorbed elsewhere, Germany might need support in the maritime domain and could also become an area of closer cooperation, especially in the Baltic Sea, for future deployments, exercises, or a coordinated maritime presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-9--operational&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 9 – Operational&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK should invite Germany, along with other EU partners, to provide an escort ship, or a marine contingent, to a future Carrier Strike Group deployment to the Indo-Pacific. This would meet the Defence Command Paper commitment to “partner more often with Germany on operational deployments, such as air policing and naval missions outside the Euro Atlantic area”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REFAMILIARISING WITH ISSUES OF NUCLEAR SECURITY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine and the risk of escalation is bringing the fields of European security and nuclear strategy back together, following a divergence after the Cold War. A conventionally weakened Russia, especially in the land domain, will likely increase its use of nuclear and hybrid levers to achieve its political and strategic objectives. Moreover, on 21 February 2023, President Putin announced the “suspension” of Russian participation in the New Start Treaty – the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and the US – reducing mechanisms for strategic stability, communication and predictability and which could, potentially, pave the way to a resumption of nuclear testing. The war in Ukraine requires an updated way of thinking about how nuclear weapons interact with conventional crises and warfare and how they are being employed by Russia as a tool of coercion and behavioural signalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IR2021 already developed the UK’s nuclear deterrence policy and doctrine towards an era of great power competition, including raising the cap on the UK’s overall weapon stockpile, reversing a trend of a decline in numbers since the Cold War, and posing a challenge in terms of its commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. As a non-nuclear weapons power, the German contribution to the debate is naturally very different to the UK position and nuclear arms control is of great significance to Germany. It is heavily influenced by its commercial sector and there are differing views from inside the coalition government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early Zeitenwende decision was to procure 35 F-35A, which allows Germany to continue to participate in the US nuclear sharing agreement, thereby clearly signalling continued Transatlanticism. However, Germany also participated as an observer in the first meeting of States Parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). This reflects the priorities of maintaining alliance solidarity and maintaining a principled approach to disarmament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, strategic stability and risk reduction are interconnected, and the security environment has forced Europe to widen its sense of what risk reduction, including deterrence, involves. Moreover, Europe collectively needs more options to manage escalation. For such discussions, non-governmental fora are the safest ground to meet on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should establish a British-German nuclear dialogue with the objective of raising both the UK and Germany’s “nuclear IQ” and encouraging a more public debate on nuclear weapons and the nuclear threats increasingly posed by hostile state actors (Russia, China, Iran, North Korea), escalation, risk reduction and strategic stability, as well as the joint challenge of nuclear proliferation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should commit to developing new Confidence and Security Building Measures (CSBMs), within an OSCE framework, and adapt them to the needs of the 21st Century, accounting for new technologies and better protection of civilian populations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uk-german-defence-and-security-operational-cooperation&quot;&gt;UK-GERMAN DEFENCE AND SECURITY OPERATIONAL COOPERATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter assesses the practical opportunities for enhanced cooperation between the UK military and the Bundeswehr, and between the UK and German defence industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK military and the Bundeswehr have a long history and a deep cultural understanding which was gained through longstanding basing of UK troops in Germany. This is exemplified by the formation of the binational German-British Amphibious Engineer Battalion 130, which specialises in bridging capabilities. They have operated together in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Mali and cooperated in countering ISIS in Syria and Iraq, amongst numerous military exercises. Most recently, the RAF and Luftwaffe have flown joint NATO air policing missions over Estonia for the first time, including the interception of a Russian aircraft, as the UK takes over the NATO rotation from Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defence-modernisation-and-readiness-for-warfighting&quot;&gt;DEFENCE MODERNISATION AND READINESS FOR WARFIGHTING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within NATO, the UK and Germany both lead eFP multinational battlegroups, are vJTF framework nations, lead Framework Nations, and aspire to operate at divisional level. However, the UK and German militaries, especially their land forces, need to modernise quickly to live up to their current NATO commitments. Indeed, there is uncertainty over whether committed UK and German divisions will be available to NATO and ready on time. Following the war in Ukraine, both militaries have been accused of eroding their own warfighting capabilities with underinvestment and being distracted with expeditionary operations. There is even an odd similarity in the current Infantry Fighting vehicle (IFv) problems with the UK Ajax further delayed into service and significantly over budget, and the German Puma IFv experiencing multiple problems, including breaking down during exercise conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Germany are currently the first and second largest European defence spenders respectively. The 2020 UK spending review provided defence with an additional 16.5 billion pounds over a four-year settlement which was described as the “largest sustained increase in the core defence budget for 30 years”. Despite the war in Ukraine, the UK Spring Budget allocated only an additional 11 billion to the defence budget for 2027/28, which will mainly go to the capital budget. This places UK defence spending at 2.1 per cent with an aspiration to increase to 2.5 per cent when “fiscal conditions allow” and as part of a broader change to the NATO Defence Investment Pledge. However, these increases might still not be enough to transform the UK military, with the National Audit Office concluding that the Equipment Plan to 2031 is highly ambitious and that UK NATO commitments are in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the war in Ukraine prompted larger increases in German defence spending. Despite the financial commitments of the Zeitenwende, Germany missed the 2022 two per cent GDP NATO target and is forecast to miss it in 2023 as well. The Bundeswehr is in a similar state following decades of underinvestment. Its return as a lever of national power and collective defence is now the number one priority and was a central part of the Zeitenwende speech, with Chancellor Scholz declaring “The goal is a powerful, cutting-edge, progressive Bundeswehr that can be relied upon to protect us”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a cash injection and rising overall spending for the Bundeswehr, it is unlikely to be enough or truly transformational, especially with inflation and fluctuations in currency, for several reasons. First, the approach is based on capability retention through equipment modernisation by providing replacements for existing equipment and programmes, so no “new” capabilities will be delivered. Much will be absorbed by the procurement of basic military equipment such as helmets and night vision. Second, the special fund is based on a 2018 capability profile, not future requirements, which will largely be developed by analysing data from the war in Ukraine. Third, due to slow procurement processes, the contracts for the special fund are only just materialising, 12 months later, and are yet to have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-12--policy-and-dialogue-and-knowledge-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 12 – Policy and Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should lead a broader European debate on defence specialisation to make the most of their comparative advantages and build on work already undertaken in their respective NATO Framework Nations. While specialisation is not a new concept in European security, the war in Ukraine has revived it and created political and economic drivers, and a greater degree of unity and focus on European defence and security than past initiatives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DEFENCE INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION AND CAPABILITIES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 DCP specifically references the 40 years of cooperation between the UK and Germany on combat air and the desire to expand this to other areas such as land systems, space, and cyberspace. Bilaterally there is only one bilateral defence procurement project between the UK and Germany – the Wide Wet Gap Crossing project – which builds on joint development of bridging capabilities. There are currently eight multinational projects in the land, sea, and air domain. Moreover, there are multiple common or similar equipment programmes in each domain which are already developing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation (OCCAR) model provides a highly effective framework for defence cooperation that the UK and Germany, as founding members, can base bilateral cooperation on. As the other joint European procurement programme is the European Defence Agency (EDA), OCCAR is currently the only realistic option for the UK, unless the UK is able to secure a deal with the EU for third party participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-13--policy&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 13 – Policy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should use the OCCAR framework as a foundation for joint procurement and use the tried and tested framework for any bilateral joint procurement projects identified.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the CEO of German defence company Hensoldt, the war in Ukraine has already transformed their business model, with demand so high that manufacturers can produce weapons without pre-orders. Operationally, the war in Ukraine has also reaffirmed the vital importance of common systems and their sustainability in production and logistic support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK and German industry is well placed to adapt to these changes and there is potential to strengthen their industrial capabilities through closer cooperation, though the war in Ukraine has not yet been decisive in this regard. To date, equipment cooperation has occurred largely by chance and has been arrived at independently. Any post-Ukraine revisions of UK and German industrial strategies would begin to enable more formal and structured cooperation. Moreover, if closer cooperation is to make a step change, the priority is to provide a political declaration to send a strong signal to UK and German industry to provide reassurance and build trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-14--political&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 14 – Political&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should commit to a joint high-level statement to make the case for a cooperative strategy to industry, which outlines the associated benefits, to provide the demand signal to industry and best prepare them for any change of approach.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, political and structural differences will likely remain with system level cooperation limited due to diverging political and industrial preferences, with Germany favouring national or EU procurement and the UK favouring national or US imports. While this might improve, it is unlikely to change. Instead, focussing on a sub-system level could develop collaborative opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the air domain, cooperation is limited by the emerging cooperative plans of the UK-Italy-Japan trilateral Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) and the Franco-German Future Combat Air System (FCAS) to produce sixth generation fighters. However, there is scope for cooperation at a sub-component level on Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4), sensors, Electronic Warfare (EW), complex weapons and other systems which could be applied across programmes for system levels of co-operations, many of which are already highlighted in UK and German industrial strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-15--operational&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 15 – Operational&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany, as members of GCAP and FCAS respectively, should lead on identifying collaborative opportunities at a sub-component level and champion cooperation and commonality where possible.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls, which caused a diplomatic problem between the UK and German in 2019 over UK exports of Eurofighter Typhoon, have come into sharper focus due to military support to Ukraine. Without strong communication and desire to mitigate and provide workarounds, arms export policies could continue to have repercussions for the European defence industry and be a significant roadblock to future cooperation. The earlier these issues are aligned the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-16--policy&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 16 – Policy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany should compare respective arms export policies and regimes in greater depth, including Parliamentary scrutiny, to create more standardised processes across Europe and increase export potential.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has also highlighted the importance of air and missile defence to protect military forces and civilian populations which has long been a European capability gap. The recent establishment of the German-led European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI) seeks to establish a European air and missile defence system through common acquisition of interoperable and off-the-shelf solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-17--dialogue-and-knowledge-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 17 – Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Germany, as heavyweights of cooperation in the European Sky Shield Initiative, should undertake analysis to enhance the initiative to move from joint procurement of common capabilities towards joint acquisition in order to understand future requirements and support NATOs Integrated Air and Missile Defence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early decision of the Zeitenwende was that the Bundeswehr will procure armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAvs) for the first time, concluding a debate that began in 2012. The “drone” debate in Germany has been difficult and conflated with the US operation of drones and questions of autonomous killing. By mid-2024, the Heron TP drone, currently leased by Germany, will be armed, then replaced with the Eurodrone by 2032. In contrast, the UK has been operating armed UAvs for decades and has experience in integrating these into operational use across services and domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-18--dialogue-and-knowledge-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 18 – Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK should establish a UAv knowledge sharing programme for a German audience on operating armed UAvs in conflicts, covering the full range of associated issues such as legality, ethics, targeting processes, collateral damage assessments, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) handling for operators. This would allow the Bundeswehr to operationally integrate armed UAvs much more quickly.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land cooperation is a growing area with joint experience on the Boxer programme, which will be enhanced through the new Boxer user group. Indeed, UK-German leadership on Boxer will be needed as rising demand starts to create supply bottlenecks. Moreover, both the UK and Germany are continuing to improve their MBTs, both using the L55A1 turret and developing standardised ammunition to enhance NATO interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are potential collaborative opportunities in developing long-range precision strike capabilities as the war in Ukraine has provided a stark demonstration of its military value and of current Russian vulnerabilities in this area. As European militaries develop their new doctrinal concepts and identify lessons from the war, it has provided a sharper focus, with knowledge sharing and joint procurement options, such as closer alignment for Germany with the UK’s Complex Weapons Programme or the UK with the German-Dutch Apollo Project on Ground-based air and missile defence. Part of land warfare development, and understanding warfighting lessons from Ukraine, is influenced by prototype warfare, integration, and doctrinal advancement, which is a leading area for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-19--dialogue-and-knowledge-sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recommendation 19 – Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK should invite the Bundeswehr to visit, and potentially join, its Experimentation Battlegroup, based in Cyprus, which leads on prototype warfare and capability development for the British Army.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-2030-roadmap-for-enhanced-cooperation&quot;&gt;A 2030 Roadmap for Enhanced Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The transformative effect of the war in Ukraine has made enhanced UK-German defence and security, and foreign policy cooperation more attractive, viable, and necessary; and moreover, this period of joint policy development is the ideal moment to develop a more structural relationship. Enhanced UK-German cooperation should be focussed on helping to lead a European Pillar of NATO, rather than the ad hoc and transactional approach that has characterised the current relationship. The strategic approach to bilateral cooperation should focus on setting clear mutual goals and establishing the right mechanisms and processes for delivery, managed through the UK-German Strategic Dialogue or a more ambitious future agreement.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Germany and the UK should include Defence Ministers in the annual Strategic Dialogue and intensify regular dialogues between the Prime Minister and Chancellor to set the level of ambition and maintain political momentum. The two countries should also explore the potential for and content of a bilateral Treaty-based defence and security relationship. This agreement should build on work already undertaken through UK and German leadership of their respective Framework Nations Concepts and should focus on increasing European burden sharing and enhancing readiness of forces. They should commit to developing new Confidence and Security Building Measures, accounting for new technologies and better protection of civilian populations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;They should use the OCCAR framework as a foundation for joint procurement and use the tried and tested framework for any bilateral joint procurement projects identified. The two countries should compare respective arms export policies and regimes in greater depth, including Parliamentary scrutiny, to create more standardised processes across Europe. Germany and the UK should implement measures for increased dialogue and knowledge sharing, such as the creation of liaison officers, the establishment of a British-German nuclear dialogue, and leading a broader European debate on defence specialisation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方確認傳畢證人 押5.29就共謀者原則作法律陳詞 拘捕警認不知何謂「攬炒十步」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/C7z2xlD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（16日）踏入審訊第58天。控方應何桂藍一方要求傳召警員盤問，其中拘捕何的警員曾向何指，有理由相信她參加初選目的在進入立會否決預算案，迫使特首辭職，以達成戴耀廷在《蘋果日報》及各大媒體提倡的「攬炒香港十步曲計劃」，惟同意當時沒有獲發戴的「攬炒十步」文章，亦不知道「攬炒十步」說什麼。此外，3名國安警供稱曾按提交物料令分別從《立場新聞》、《獨立媒體》和《蘋果日報》公司接收初選廣告相關文件，惟有警員承認沒看過該提交物料令，對相關資料也不清楚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方確認已傳召所有證人，案件押至本月29日續審，以待控辯雙方呈交有關「共謀者原則」的法律陳詞，何桂藍一方亦會爭議匿名證人片段的呈堂性。法官李運騰指《國安法》沒有追溯力，關注共謀者原則是否適用於《國安法》生效前的言行、及後來加入串謀的被告，辯方透露將提交聯合書面陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安警稱從立場前總編接收提交物料令資料-涉民動廣告-惟認無看過提交令&quot;&gt;國安警稱從《立場》前總編接收「提交物料令」資料 涉民動廣告 惟認無看過提交令&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀甫開庭表示，上周確診的彭今早已轉為陰性，彭於正庭與其他被告同坐。至於施德來則仍在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今應辯方要求傳召5名警員接受盤問，其中3人均與警方於2020年12月24日獲高院簽發提交物料令，要求《獨立媒體》、《立場新聞》和《蘋果日報》公司交出資料有關。其中偵緝警員13344黎啟東於2011年加入警隊，自2020年7月駐守國安處，供稱於2021年2月10日獲指示到警察總部，從《立場新聞》時任總編輯鍾沛權接收一份關於民主動力在《立場》投放廣告的20多頁文件，包括 WhatsApp 對話紀錄、電郵記錄和單據。黎其後與鍾簽收，並要求他就提交物料令落口供，但鍾拒絕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 問，該份提交物料令是否於2020年12月24日獲得，黎稱「唔好意思我冇呢方面嘅資料啊當時」，並指他沒見過該提交物料令，不知是何時發給《立場》，也不知警方發出後有否與《立場》溝通，亦不清楚為何指明要提交自2020年6月9日起至12月24日的資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安警稱從獨立媒體及蘋果日報接收資料-有警認不清楚提交物料令資料&quot;&gt;國安警稱從《獨立媒體》及《蘋果日報》接收資料 有警認不清楚提交物料令資料&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於偵緝警員12131王錫輝，於2010年加入警隊，自2020年7月駐守國安處。他同意於2021年2月25日，有律師樓文員為《蘋果日報》和壹傳媒向他按提交物料令交出文件和一隻DVD，內含約200頁文件，包括吳政亨的「三投三不投」頭版廣告和初選投票日的網上廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在 Beel 盤問下，黃指「有關提交物料令嘅資料，其實我係唔清楚嘅」，指他僅於當天早上獲指示於相關時間到灣仔警署接收文件，事前「我係唔知道自己會收到咩文件，但知道同35+初選案件有關」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於偵緝警員12381梁晉榮，於2010年加入警隊，自2020年7月駐守國安處，並獲委任為本案調查警員。他確認2021年1月12日在警察總部，接收由獨立媒體董事黃俊邦按提交物料令交出的12頁資料。與上兩名警員不同，作為本案調查警員的梁，盤問下指看過該提交物料令，知道是同年1月6日向獨立媒體發出，但不清楚為何列明要取得自2020年6月9日起的資料，指「呢個唔係我考慮範圍」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安警稱從圖書館及報刊辦-搜2019年6月至2020年8月戴耀廷報章文章&quot;&gt;國安警稱從圖書館及報刊辦 搜2019年6月至2020年8月戴耀廷報章文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁晉榮亦負責取得和保存戴耀廷在報章發表的文章。梁表示於2021年4月8日，警員12656從公共圖書館借來276份從2019年6月至2020年8月的《蘋果日報》，他檢視後選取47份包含戴耀廷發表的文章，進行影印和掃描，其中19篇為控方證物；梁同年4月15日再從電影、報刊及物品辦事處取得一篇《蘋果日報》和兩篇《明報》的文章，包括〈35+已超額完成〉及〈中共對港的戰略及戰術〉。他確認上述文章與他理解戴就35+的概念相符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問到，梁搜證時有否特定的文章列表，抑或只是搜尋戴耀廷的文章。梁指沒有特定列表，而是知道戴會於網上發文，亦相信他會在《蘋果日報》或《明報》刊登，故到報刊辦和公共圖書館，按2019年的年中到年尾至2020年初選舉行的時限搜尋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，除了文章作者顯示為「戴耀廷」，梁並不知道戴實際上是文章作者。梁同意「冇辦法確認」，但認為戴在 Facebook 和記者會的發言，與他文章言論是「大致吻合」。法官陳仲衡問，他是否察覺戴曾投訴《蘋果日報》或《明報》發表冒用他名字的文章，梁指沒有，並指「好多時佢（戴）Facebook 都轉載返呢啲文章」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安警指因有藍剔故信是何桂藍fb-官質疑盤問意義-辯方稱獲指示要求嚴格舉證&quot;&gt;國安警指因有藍剔故信是何桂藍FB 官質疑盤問意義 辯方稱獲指示要求嚴格舉證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;餘下兩人涉何桂藍的案情。其中警長5820梁樂文負責網上蒐證，他2006年加入警隊，自2020年7月駐守國安處，2021年1月升為警長。梁供稱，由於何桂藍是35+初選的其中一個參選人，故在「Google」搜尋「何桂藍」，何的 Facebook 專頁「何桂藍 Gwyneth Ho」為第一個結果，他進入後以「鄧奇」的帳戶將與初選有關的帖文截圖，包括「墨落無悔」聲明、何宣傳謝票的街站和轉發她在《洛杉磯時報》的文章，均於2020年8月截圖。法官陳慶偉一度問Beel 是否挑戰以上證供，Beel 回應他獲指示要求控方嚴格舉證（put to straight proof）。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在 Beel 盤問下，梁確認就何桂藍而言，只就此 Facebook 專頁截圖。被問截圖準則，梁指與35+初選案相關就有需要；至於如何得知確實是何的專頁，梁指因看到何的名字後有藍剔，故有理由相信是何使用的帳號。他在法官追問下亦指，對何公開表達的想法「大概有少少認知」，而何的帖文與之吻合，他亦比對過何的相片與專頁吻合。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 完成盤問後，陳慶偉指老實說看不到挑戰相關證供的意義。Beel 指不爭議該些證供本身，只是獲當事人指示就相關證供要求嚴格舉證。法官李運騰指明白他的難處，但若何桂藍其後選擇作供，她也會被問到相關 Facebook 帖文，Beel 重申只是嘗試跟隨當事人指示，他不爭議證物的真確性（authenticity）。陳慶偉指相信 Beel 已向何講述挑戰這些證供的後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警拘捕時指初選目的在達成戴耀廷攬炒十步曲計劃-惟認無獲發文章亦不知是說什麼&quot;&gt;警拘捕時指初選目的在達成戴耀廷攬炒十步曲計劃 惟認無獲發文章亦不知是說什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;負責拘捕何桂藍的偵緝警員18834黃柏烽其後作供，他2014年加入警隊，2021年1月6日駐守新界北總區反黑組。在 Beel 盤問下，他同意當天早上獲警長羅振威（音譯）訓示，稍後會就一宗顛覆國家政權案進行拘捕行動，並按照羅手上文件的內容去進行拘捕，涉及要向被捕人說的話及拘捕原因。黃指當時由探員1080負責處理證物，印象中獲口頭指示要檢取電子儀器，其他則沒印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續引述黃的口供，指他拘捕時曾向何桂藍表示：「我而家拉你，罪名係顛覆國家政權罪。因為我有理由相信你喺2020年期間參選一個名為『35+公民投票』嘅初選活動，選出35名或以上初選勝出者，進入立法會議會，目的在於否決政府嘅任何財政預算案或議案，從而迫使行政長官辭職。呢一個行為，在於達成戴耀廷在《蘋果日報》及各大媒體上所提倡嘅『攬炒香港十步曲』計劃，旨在嚴重干擾、阻撓及破壞香港特別行政區政權機關依法履行職能。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃同意，進行拘捕時獲發有上述內容的文件，Beel 問除此之外，他當時還有其他與「攬炒十步」有關的文件嗎？李運騰追問，他當時有否獲提供該「攬炒十步」文章？黃指沒有。Beel 追問，「你當時是否知道這（「攬炒十步」）是關於什麼？（“At that time did you understand what that matter is about?”）」，陳慶偉亦糾正翻譯問：「嗰陣時你知唔知講緊乜嘢嘢？」黃答：「唔知道。」Beel 問，因此若何桂藍問到，他也不能回答？黃同意，亦同意他要請示上級才能回答，不過何桂藍當時沒有問。Beel 表示已完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨與控方達成新一份同意事實-指曾以李伯盧網名於連登發帖&quot;&gt;吳政亨與控方達成新一份同意事實 指曾以「李伯盧」網名於連登發帖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘指吳與控方達成新一份同意事實，望能節省傳召兩名證人的時間。庭上讀出該份同意事實，提及吳2021年1月被捕後被警員11632檢取手機，內有與戴耀廷的 WhatsApp 紀錄；而吳的 Instagram 帳號為「@LEEBAKLOU」，與「@legcopetition」相關，吳並曾以「李伯盧」網名於2020年7月17日在連登討論區發表帖文「N之内係正選 N之外係後備 就係咁簡單」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方確認已傳所有證人-尚餘共謀者原則及證人x片段呈堂性爭議&quot;&gt;控方確認已傳所有證人 尚餘共謀者原則及證人X片段呈堂性爭議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方確認已傳召所有證人，並指目前有新一份同意事實。陳慶偉問還有多少份，控方指尚有一份在傳閱，法官着該兩份稍後再一同讀出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行確認，控方案情將完結，但此前尚要處理「共謀者原則（co-conspirator’s rule）」的法律爭議，以及 Trevor Beel 就證人X錄影和錄音檔案呈堂性的爭議。控辯雙方同意，就 Beel 的呈堂性爭議，他會於下周一（22日）提交書面陳詞，控方於周四（25日）書面回應；至於共謀者原則的爭議，控方同於22日提交書面陳詞，辯方於25日書面回應，並於5月29日開庭進行法律爭議，預計同日處理剩餘的同意事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉一度指，在29日前他們可休息，Beel 指他們會在工作而非休息，李運騰則笑說法庭有其他事務要處理，沒有餘裕放長假。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注共謀者原則是否適用於國安法前言行及後來加入的被告&quot;&gt;官關注共謀者原則是否適用於《國安法》前言行及後來加入的被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文其後表示，辯方團隊正在協調，將就共謀者原則為法庭提供一份聯合書面陳詞，主要法律理據是《國安法》只在2020年7月1日生效，沒有追溯力；個別被告亦會針對其案情提交陳詞。根據該原則，各共謀者的言行均可用來指證所有被告，而控方早前指並非本案被告的蔡澤鴻、黎敬輝和郭榮鏗均是本案共謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/b2e6Kfm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃碧雲&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指理解《國安法》並無追溯力，而本案爭議點是共謀者在《國安法》2020年6月30日生效前的言行，是否可納為共謀者原則下的證據。沈回應將就此引用16個案例，並重申《國安法》無追溯力，問題是普通法下的共謀者原則會否被《國安法》所影響。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，假設共謀者原則適用，尚要考慮被告在加入串謀前，其他共謀者所作的言行能否用來指證他，因被告於不同時間加入串謀。沈回應，不少案例均支持原先共謀者的言行並不會影響後來加入的人。陳慶偉最後指，就共謀者原則做決定後，辯方才可說明是否要求毋須答辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押至5月29日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

What would it take to make them fit for current and future challenges?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is part of the CSIS project Transforming European Defense. The goal of the project is to leverage the strengths of CSIS in political-military analysis and defense industry engagement to create a plan of action to rationalize European defense. It will develop specific recommendations for European policymakers to reduce inefficiencies and seek creative joint endeavors for European security. The project also develops recommendations for actionable initiatives that U.S. policymakers can engage with and push European allies to implement. This project thus seeks to impact policy on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the war in Ukraine has put the emphasis on land warfare and the importance of controlling the skies, the naval dimension should not be overlooked. Strategic competitors’ fleets are growing in numbers, in tonnage, and in sophistication, and they increasingly contest maritime borders as well as international laws and customs applicable to the maritime domain. Faced with overlapping challenges, European navies are plagued by a number of issues such as poor availability of assets, lack of combat readiness, aging platforms, fragmentation, and insufficient coordination. This report outlines the main threats and challenges that Europeans face at sea and details the gaps in capabilities before providing recommendations for how to fill those gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Cold War became history, so did the prospect of conventional conflict at sea against a peer competitor — or so most Western capitals believed. The post–Cold War peace dividend ushered in decades of dwindling investment in naval capabilities and a refocus on low-end missions for Western nations. This contrasted with a massive naval investment by yet-to-become rivals, China and Russia. As Europeans awaken to a new era of strategic competition, they now face a highly threatening maritime environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic competitors’ fleets are growing in numbers, in tonnage, and in sophistication; further, there is a proliferation of advanced missiles, sensors, and autonomous weapons, along with the application of disruptive technologies such as cyber and artificial intelligence (AI). A more assertive China is now at the helm of one of the largest navies in the world. The war in Ukraine has so far left Russia’s naval capabilities largely untouched. In addition to a buildup of capabilities, strategic competitors increasingly contest maritime borders as well as international laws and customs applicable to the maritime domain. Once unfathomable, modern naval warfare is now not so distant or unlikely of a prospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the war in Ukraine has put the emphasis on land warfare and the importance of controlling the skies, the naval dimension should not be overlooked. In the first weeks of the conflict, Russia quickly moved to block Ukrainian ports, laid sea mines, deployed its nuclear submarines, and effectively launched Kalibr missile strikes from the sea. Subsequent missile, drone, and autonomous vessel attacks by Ukraine on Russian forces — as well as decisions by Turkey to restrict access to the Bosporus Strait and the Dardanelles — have considerably hampered Russian maneuvers, showing the importance of controlling key choke points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has an economy equivalent in size to the United States or China, and its members combined have the largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world. More than 75 percent of European imports enter by sea and 99 percent of its data is provided through undersea cables, while Europe’s navies and shipping firms rely on free navigation. Europe is therefore a global economic power with immense interest in maintaining free and open seas and respect for international maritime laws and norms, whether in the Indo-Pacific, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, or the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet maritime security is now affected by challenges of increasing diversity and intensity. Unfortunately, the state of European navies is largely consistent with the broader state of European defense. Europe’s navies have suffered underinvestment for years, if not decades. The European naval landscape amounts to patchy, isolated, and often unconcerted national efforts. European navies are plagued by a number of issues such as poor availability of assets, lack of combat readiness, aging platforms, fragmentation, and insufficient coordination. Should a scenario of high-intensity warfare arise, European navies would likely be underequipped and underprepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown by the EU Strategic Compass and NATO’s Strategic Concept, Europeans are aware of the need to step up to this new strategic environment. Additionally, navies continue to play a vital diplomatic role, whether in the form of ship visits, naval exercises, or freedom of navigation operations. These activities send important messages to allies and partners — as well as to adversaries — about Europe’s strength, its dependability, and its resolve. Conversely, Europe’s lack of naval capacity means that Europe struggles to ensure the necessary level of presence at sea, undercutting its broader diplomatic standing. As Europe focuses on rebuilding its armies and air forces for a Russia contingency, it cannot neglect the naval domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maintaining a strong naval capacity is a resource-intensive effort, and it comes at a time when every segment of Europe’s militaries calls for renewed investments, putting strain on still limited budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European navies are facing several dilemmas. They must deal simultaneously with increased security threats along their shores and the need to increase their presence further away in order to protect sea lines of communication, their key interests, and the interests of their partners abroad, all of which can take them very far from their territory. Currently, due to its shrinking naval capacity, Europe has difficulties ensuring a permanent presence at sea in critical areas, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. It must invest in high-end capabilities to stand up to key competitors, but European countries also cannot afford to relinquish their assets for coast guard functions or neglect daily issues that can disrupt their vital supplies or could result in humanitarian catastrophe. There is a danger, as focus goes to rebuilding Europe’s armies, air forces, and missile defense capacities, that European navies will be deprived of investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, this report explores ways to rationalize efforts to adapt European navies to this new and fast-evolving environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;threats-in-the-maritime-domain&quot;&gt;Threats in the Maritime Domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Increasingly Intense and Diverse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While strategic competition on and below the seas is shaping maritime security, lower-end issues such as piracy, migration, and organized crime at sea have not disappeared — quite the contrary. These challenges are compounded by the effects of climate change and overfishing, which have evolved into the top concerns in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-competition-at-sea&quot;&gt;Strategic Competition at Sea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powers aspiring to contest the world order are investing massively in their navies, equipping their warships with more diverse, advanced, and complex combat systems to gain a capability edge. They simultaneously call into question the laws, rules, and practices applicable to the maritime domain. The increased propensity for uninhibited aggression in sea lines of communication vital for Europe has been underlined by naval “incidents” such as the Iranian attacks on tankers in the Gulf in 2019 or some tense encounters in the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUSSIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin has long sought to counterbalance the perceived superiority of its peers in terms of tonnage, number of ships, and force projection capabilities. The navy of the Russian Federation (Voyenno-morskoiflot, VMF) has developed highly capable submarines (such as the recently commissioned Project 08851 Yasen-M SSGN and Project 955A Borey-A SSBN) and powerful offensive missile systems with nuclear-tipped torpedo capability. Although it lost its Black Sea flagship — the Slava-class surface ship Moskva — two months into the conflict in Ukraine (the first destruction of a major warship in combat since the British frigate Sheffield during the Falklands war 40 years ago), the VMF is the only corps of the Russian armed forces that remains largely untouched by the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TWMpUY7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: The Russian Threat Axis.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: The threat axis (defined by the red dashed lines) show the routes that NATO and the European Union will need to monitor for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. This will provide critical warnings and indicators of Russia’s maritime activities. Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it plans significant additions in the coming years, as it is working on the Surrogate-W unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) and on modernizing the fleet’s anti-ship missile capabilities through a process known as “Kalibrisation”: the widespread equipment of 3M14 Kalibr cruise missiles on a variety of vessels. This adds to the 3M22 Zircon hypersonic cruise missile, which is still in development and allegedly capable of Mach 9 speeds with a 1,000 km range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VMF is therefore set to evolve as the most critical naval threat to Europeans, with its ability to pose strategic dilemmas, to employ an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategy, and to eventually engage in naval warfare with significant symmetric and asymmetric assets. However, it is unclear whether Russia will be able to maintain its modernization plans. Russia will likely prioritize the war in Ukraine, limiting the availability of certain assets like missiles. Its defense industries might also struggle to access or replace Western parts and components critical to its naval modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has built a modern navy at great speed and now operates the largest navy in the world (in terms of number of ships, not tonnage, in which it remains second to the United States). Contrary to Europeans, the investment in modern capabilities for the People’s Liberation Army Navy has been underway for more than 25 years. It now possesses three aircraft carriers and has been moving rapidly to fill a gap in amphibious capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the overall battle force of China’s navy is expected to grow to 400 ships by 2025 and 440 ships by 2030 (compared to 290 for the United States by 2030), along with 5 aircraft carriers and 10 ballistic missile subs. China’s military modernization effort is aimed at asserting Chinese claims in what Beijing perceives as its hinterland: Taiwan and near-seas regions, particularly the South China Sea. This alone has the potential to affect Europeans, as it would give China leverage over key sea lanes of communication — 30 percent of global trade goes through the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges posed by China are not limited to the Indo-Pacific. Beijing is also developing vessels capable of sailing far from its shores (a “blue-water navy”). It established in 2017 its first overseas military base in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa. It simultaneously invests in dual-use infrastructures on key sea lanes of communication along its Belt and Road Initiative and in important ports in Europe (Piraeus, Hamburg), potentially developing facilities that China can use to conduct activities running counter to European interests (from espionage to navigation disruptions). Chinese navy ships are also conducting an increasing number of operations in the waters surrounding Europe, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORTH KOREA, IRAN, AND OTHERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other countries overtly challenge the international rules-based order and have also invested in their naval capabilities. The North Korean navy is tied to the nuclear program via Kim Jong-un’s personalized push for a submarine-based second-strike capability. It maintains one of the world’s largest submarine fleets, with estimates ranging from between 60 and 80 vessels, although these are mostly coastal and aging. It cooperates actively with China — notably because the navy plays a preeminent role in fishing, a sector in which Beijing’s interests are enmeshed with those of the Korean peninsula. The Islamic Republic of Iran has embraced a hybrid strategy combining conventional naval power — including capability buildup, such as the delivery of its Shahid Soleimani catamaran missile corvette in 2022 — and asymmetric warfare through thousands of heavily armed speedboats or sabotage activities against commercial vessels or offshore energy infrastructures. It has also instituted joint drills with Russia in the northern Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEY CHOKE POINTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic competition at sea is also defined to a large extent by the ability to control critical sea lines of communication and key choke points. Control of the Bosporous Strait is a major asset: for example, during the war in Ukraine, Turkey implemented Article 19 of the 1936 Montreux Convention, restricting warships from accessing the Black Sea. In this regard, the Suez Canal and the Strait of Hormuz are major Achilles’ heels for European countries, especially as rivals and competitors are trying to get footholds in the northern Indian Ocean, through which transits half of the value of the trade between the European Union and Asia. This underlines the importance of relations with countries such as Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regional situation in the eastern Mediterranean is also extremely volatile, with competing claims over resources and EEZs opposing all littoral countries (Turkey, Cyprus, Greece, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, and Libya). Although there have been some diplomatic breakthroughs — such as the agreement between Lebanon and Israel through U.S.-led, French-supported efforts — the majority of maritime boundaries in this region are not demarcated, and those that have been agreed bilaterally are contested by other countries in the area. Renewed tensions could therefore arise, as the situation frustrates the exploration, exploitation, and commercialization potential deriving from the substantial hydrocarbon resources present in this part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey, although a NATO ally, has repeatedly provoked diplomatic or security incidents in recent years with other European allies and EU members in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey has a revisionist vision of its own maritime environment, encapsulated in its Mavi Vatan (“Blue Homeland”) doctrine developed by admirals of Turkey’s navy. It lays claims on a continental plateau and EEZs that are also claimed by Cyprus and Greece; this is exemplified by the agreement with Libya’s Government of National Accord in 2019 to establish a common maritime border, encroaching on Greece’s claimed EEZ. The matter is compounded by the large presence of hydrocarbons in disputed areas, leading Turkey to conduct illegal exploration and drilling — in which operating ships are escorted by Turkish military vessels — as part of a broader pattern of aggressive and assertive behavior at sea to advance its interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With new routes and economic opportunities arising from the receding of Arctic ice, the High North is also set to be increasingly disputed. Russia released a new Maritime Doctrine in July 2022 that presents the region as its most important focus, pledging to protect its waters “by all means.” This includes the introduction of new missile capabilities for its Northern Fleet, an increasing number of exercises, and the buildup of the largest icebreakers fleet, some of which are Kalibr-capable. Russia’s combined A2/AD and new offensive capabilities increase the vulnerability of the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap and expose neighboring Arctic countries such as Norway or Finland. In any NATO-Russia conflict, protecting this sea lane — and therefore the maritime link between North America and Europe — will be vital to the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europeans also have increasing stakes in the Indo-Pacific, as the region is key for the future of Europe’s prosperity and security. Some countries have direct interests in the region, such as France through its overseas territories and its permanent military bases in both the Indian and Pacific Oceans; others are less directly concerned but acknowledge it as the epicenter of strategic and systemic competition as well as the top priority for their key ally, the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ekf271j.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Soldiers of the Naval Special Forces Command take part in a boarding demonstration on board a frigate during the inaugural visit of the German defence minister to the German navy (Deutsche Marine) at the naval base in Eckernförde, northern Germany, on February 21, 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen an unprecedented concentration of European warships in the region, including from “non-usual suspects” such as Germany with its Bayern frigate historical voyage across the region or the Royal Netherlands Navy frigate Evertsen in support of the UK-led Carrier Strike Group in 2021. The geographical immensity of the area and an array of further challenges will represent a litmus test for European assets’ availability and projectability. As emphasized by the simultaneous, uncoordinated announcement of the AUKUS security partnership and the EU Indo-Pacific strategy on September 15, 2021, there are strategic dilemmas for European countries between aligning on U.S. interests and policies in the region or charting an alternative, autonomous path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NON-STATE FACTORS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, piracy and criminality at sea (armed robbery, kidnapping of seafarers, bunkering, etc.) have not disappeared. Hotspots and methods are constantly evolving: while the northern Indian Ocean was the main nest of piracy in the 2010s, notably off the coasts of Somalia, the numbers of attacks has constantly decreased in the region (from 200 in 2011 to only a handful in recent years) with the aid of European action through EU Naval Force (EUNAVFOR) Operation Atalanta, which began in 2008. The new piracy hotbed in the past few years has been the Gulf of Guinea, while high rates of criminality at sea remain in areas such as the Caribbean or the Malacca Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, largely driven by Chinese and Asian demand that induces fisheries to look for resources further afield, is also an increasing source of tensions. By depleting fish stocks, it can have a dramatic impact for some local communities that heavily rely on products from the sea for their daily needs (such as those in the Gulf of Guinea, the southern Indian Ocean, or Southeast Asia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illegal migrations by sea, human trafficking, and smuggling also take a heavy toll: First, in human lives, with deaths in the thousands each year on migrants’ routes to Europe (over 3,000 in 2021). Second, by mobilizing important assets, as well as human and financial resources. Third, because migration disputes can divide Europe and create unease over how to handle the issue, as shown by recurring tensions between France and the United Kingdom over English Channel crossings or between Italy and France over migration rescue operations at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, climate change transforms maritime spaces and is a threat multiplier. If climate adaptation and coastal protection efforts fail by 2100, approximately 48 percent of the world’s land area, 52 percent of the global population, and 46 percent of global socioeconomic infrastructures and activities are at risk of flooding. It also results in a growing number of natural disasters, requiring navies to invest in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief assets and operational knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, critical infrastructures at sea are increasingly targeted, as part of hybrid attacks aiming at harming European interests while remaining under the threshold that could trigger a collective response from NATO or the European Union. Energy platforms or undersea cables that are key to the European economy are particularly vulnerable, as shown by the sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines or the mysterious rupture of submarine fiber-optic cables near France and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges and threats are increasingly severe and diverse, and tackling them all at once is an immense task that creates some dilemmas for European navies. First, they must choose between giving priority to high-end or low-end capacities. Second, there is a tension between focusing on protecting Europe’s shores and surroundings and venturing further away, be it to actively protect key sea lines of communication, to defend the rules-based order, or to appear as credible security providers for partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report argues that European countries do not have the luxury to choose their threats. They should therefore seek ways to rationalize their collective efforts and capitalize on each other’s assets, as well as those of their partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-european-naval-landscape&quot;&gt;The European “Naval Landscape”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning the Tide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2000 and 2020, European navies retired a third of their main surface combatants (frigates and destroyers), bringing the fleets to their smallest size in recent history. European countries are now reinvesting, with a view to high-intensity warfare at sea. This includes investments in surface combatants, amphibious vessels, and submarines (see Table 1 below), but it also involves boosting their capacity for logistics, surveillance, and long-range strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, such capabilities are difficult to develop in the short term due to their technical complexity, long lead times to delivery, and costs. Each country strikes a balance between deploying low-end military capabilities for daily security tasks on the one hand and developing high-end war-fighting capabilities for worst-case scenarios on the other. The following section outlines an overview of priorities, and some capabilities, of the main European navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ONLY TWO NUCLEAR, EXPEDITIONARY NAVIES ABLE TO ASSEMBLE COALITIONS: FRANCE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France and the United Kingdom are currently the two most important European navies — and they will remain so, considering their investment plans. Their navies share very similar features, being the only two operating nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines for nuclear deterrence and attack submarines able to launch conventionally armed land-attack cruise missiles. They have unique deployment capacity and experience among Europeans, sustained by the possession of overseas territories as well as a wide network of partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their strained bilateral relationship over Brexit — which, in the naval domain, culminated in the AUKUS episode which scrapped a monumental submarine deal between France and Australia — has stalled the cooperation between the two neighbors. There is hope, however, that announcements at the March 2023 summit between Emmanuel Macron and Rishi Sunak give new impetus to the relationship. The leaders pledged to fully harness the potential of the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (a common deployable force that reached its full operational capacity in 2020) to move forward regarding the joint development of the future cruise/anti-ship weapons (FC/ASW) and to coordinate carriers’ deployments “to provide complementary and more persistent European presence in regions of shared interest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;France:&lt;/strong&gt; The French navy (Marine Nationale) is the only national maritime force besides that of the United States to operate a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, as well as the only European navy to include a catapult-equipped carrier. It has a significant surface combatant fleet, but its vessels are stretched thin over the second-largest EEZ in the world and multiple operational engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key priorities for France include contributing to nuclear deterrence through its strategic submarine fleet and nuclear-capable embarked aircraft, protecting France’s sovereignty at sea and in its EEZ (mainly located in the Indo-Pacific), and maintaining power projection capabilities. The navy’s budget is dedicated to large-scale procurement programs such as the next-generation nuclear aircraft carrier to replace the Charles de Gaulle. Commissioning is expected in 2038 and is set to feature an angled light deck and up to three electromagnetic aircraft launch systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France also plans the purchase of six Suffren-class Barracuda nuclear attack submarines (SSN) and five FTI medium-sized frigates, and it has recently received six of its eight — and last — European multi-mission frigates (FREMM). Overall, France is planning to have 15 frontline frigates and destroyers by 2030. France also plans to upgrade 18 maritime patrol aircraft (ATL2s) and three out of five La Fayette frigates. Several of France’s largest, most expensive procurement programs, such as the FC/ASW missile system and a new generation of strategic nuclear submarines, will not be delivered until after 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United Kingdom:&lt;/strong&gt; London aims to meet its stated ambition of “restoring Britain’s position as the foremost naval power in Europe.” The Royal Navy calls for a doubling in shipbuilding investment over the next five years. The United Kingdom has the ambition to operate its two 65,000 metric ton carriers simultaneously and maintain the United Kingdom’s continuous deterrence posture at sea, increasing the number of deployments at sea by fifth-generation F-35 combat aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the surface fleet, the plan is to increase the frigate fleet from 19 to 24 by the mid-2030s with upgraded versions of the Type-31 and Type-32 frigates and Type-45 destroyer as well as a newly launched Type-26 frigate. The 2022 National Shipbuilding Strategy outlines a pipeline of close to 150 new naval and civil vessels over 30 years. While the United Kingdom plans to invest in a range of new weapons — including air- and sea-launched long-range, anti-ship cruise missiles — these will only enter service after 2030. The United Kingdom is also regenerating its fixed-wing maritime-patrol aircraft capability, essential to protect the nuclear deterrent. Through the AUKUS security partnership with the United States and Australia, the United Kingdom will help develop the SSN-AUKUS for Australia, which will be based upon their next-generation SSN design and will be built and deployed by both Australia and the United Kingdom. Building is expected to start before the end of this decade, for a delivery in the late 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORLD-CLASS NAVIES: ITALY, GERMANY, SPAIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Italy:&lt;/strong&gt; The Italian navy (Marina Militare) is one of the most important contributors to NATO and EU efforts in the Mediterranean Sea. The EUNAVFOR-MED Irini Operation is headquartered in Rome, while the U.S. Navy 6th Fleet is based in Naples. Italy operates the Cavour flagship with a carrier wing for F-35Bs, making it the only one in the European Union to have a carrier strike group equipped with fifth-generation aircraft. Below the surface, the backbone of the Italian navy is the four German-Italian Type-212A submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Marina Militare is planning to acquire new combat systems that will increase its potential for naval warfare, starting with long-range strike capabilities in the form of cruise missiles fitted onto frigates, destroyers, and submarines. Among the navy’s most important priorities is to strengthen its anti-submarine capabilities, in view of the underwater environment becoming more congested in the Mediterranean. It has therefore ordered two U212 Near Future Submarines. The Multi-Year Programming Document for 2022–2024 also outlines the plans to launch de-risking studies for the two next-generation destroyers (dubbed DDX) to replace the navy’s two Durand de la Penne–class units by 2028. This is only if sufficient funding can be provided. According to the navy, the blurring of the domains’ boundaries requires a new concept for naval combat, which was outlined in some detail by the Future Combat Naval System 2035 in Multi-Domain Operations (FCNS 2035) concept. However, the Marina Militare remains in an early stage regarding sea-based unmanned platforms, as it operates only a modest number of small shipborne unmanned aerial vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Germany:&lt;/strong&gt; While the post–World War II German navy has been mostly dedicated to the protection of German seas and NATO missions, it has recently extended its actions and ambitions, contributing to EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) operations in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean and sending frigates to the Indo-Pacific. Germany boasts the largest number of naval auxiliaries but is far behind the other major European navies in terms of combatant vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the “Zeitenwende” context, the air force and land army will likely be given greater priority. Yet the German navy’s current defense plan includes major investments in new anti-submarine aircraft as well as more combat support ships, including frigates, five corvettes, two submarines, and mine-laying capabilities. Germany also plans to equip its frigates with anti-submarine warfare technologies. It has purchased submarines in partnership with Norway and it is pursuing a deal with India to jointly build six conventional submarines. Concerning its main weapons system, the navy is producing a replacement for its aging Harpoon stock: Kongsberg Naval Strike Missiles. The navy is also working towards acquiring a submarine-based missile, while the so-called Interactive Defence and Attack System for Submarines (IDAS) has been under development for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spain:&lt;/strong&gt; Once world-straddling, Spain’s navy (Armada Española) is now modest in size and capabilities, and it very much depends on international operations to maintain its capacity to deploy overseas. It leads EU operation Atalanta, headquartered in Rota since 2019. In 2020, Spain joined the European Patrol Corvette project under the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) scheme aimed at developing corvettes that can serve missions performed by offshore patrol boats and light frigates. In addition to the new Isaac Peral submarine class (S-81), the Spanish navy is expected to receive five F110-class multi-mission frigates by 2031. With looming budgets, however, Spain is likely to find it difficult to support its wide range of capabilities at current spending levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTHER ROBUST EUROPEAN NAVIES: THE NETHERLANDS, DENMARK, GREECE, NORWAY, PORTUGAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Netherlands:&lt;/strong&gt; The Netherlands will replace the aging Walrus-class submarines to maintain its high-demand submarine capability within NATO and the European Union. The Royal Netherlands Navy is also upgrading two of its four air defense and command frigates, which should be equipped with a new, more advanced surface-to-surface missile to replace the Harpoon. The Netherlands has also conducted national guidelines for maritime engagement in the Indo-Pacific. The country has an advanced domestic defense industry, including for naval ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greece:&lt;/strong&gt; Athens’ plans for its navy are mainly oriented by Turkey’s growing military posture in the Aegean Sea. The Greek government has approved a multibillion-dollar project to modernize the naval forces. This includes the purchase of three Belharra frigates. Greece has an extensive defense industry focused on the domestic market, capable of manufacturing and developing naval vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denmark:&lt;/strong&gt; Denmark’s economy relies heavily on the seas and the country boasts the world’s largest container shipping company through the APM Maersk group. The Royal Danish Navy (Sørværnet) is notable for operating the Absalon-class support ship, which is unique for combining the features of a frigate and a landing platform dock. The Danish Ministry of Defence plans to strengthen by investing in new warships. The Iver Huitfeldt–class frigates (also known as the lead ship in the three-ship class of the Royal Danish Navy) have been upgraded with ballistic missile defense and integrated air and defense capabilities.44 In partnership with Finland, Denmark also seeks to improve future mine-laying solutions based on existing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norway:&lt;/strong&gt; The Norwegian Fleet is composed of several types of vessels, including frigates, submarines, minesweepers, and service vessels. Some of the major project activities in the upcoming period are the replacement of the current ULA-class submarines with 212CD-class submarines in partnership with Germany and the order of additional Kongsberg fifth-generation naval missiles that represent the navy’s main weapon against surface ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portugal:&lt;/strong&gt; Maritime security is one of the key tasks of Portugal’s armed forces. The Portuguese navy (Marinha Portuguesa) aims to strengthen its means of surveillance by 2029, with the purchase of six new ocean patrol vessels in addition to the four that are already in service. The Portuguese navy has also launched a new drone mothership project, also known as a multifunctional naval platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweden:&lt;/strong&gt; Sweden has an active naval shipbuilding industry, able to produce conventional submarines. It has embraced amphibious capabilities for small-scale, special operations forces insertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NATO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two main supranational organizations in charge of European security play a key role in supporting the synchronization and coordination of European navies’ agendas and strategies — a purpose they unevenly fulfill. As in other domains, the two organizations also face the issue of avoiding duplications and finding useful complementarities. They will also increasingly seek to be the prime venue to coordinate European involvement in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NATO,&lt;/strong&gt; by virtue of its mission to defend the Euro-Atlantic area, is the designated venue to coordinate allied navies through its Maritime Command (MARCOM) headquartered in Northwood in the United Kingdom. NATO ensures a permanent presence at sea through its two multinational Standing Naval Maritime Groups (SNMG) and their two mine countermeasures equivalents (SNMCMG); it also plans major military exercises, such as Dynamic Manta, Dynamic Guard, and Dynamic Mongoose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, however, since the end of the Cold War NATO has followed the general European movement toward low-end missions, launching its own counter-piracy effort in the Indian Ocean (Ocean Shield, 2009–2016) and maritime security operations in the Mediterranean (Operation Sea Guardian, launched in 2016 to take over from Operation Active Endeavour, which had been set up in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and is now largely moribund).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alliance is now trying to adapt to ongoing trends toward naval warfare, especially following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. NATO has thus launched initiatives that focus on applying disruptive technologies in the maritime domain, such as the Maritime Unmanned Systems Initiative to enhance the alliance’s capabilities, particularly in the areas of anti-submarine warfare and mine countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has accrued experience in deploying naval operations (EUNAVFOR) along non-European shores, such as Atalanta in the Indian Ocean or Sophia (and then Irini) along the Libyan coastline. These have primarily been performing maritime security tasks, countering piracy, and conducting maritime surveillance assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union adopted its first EU Maritime Security Strategy and its Action Plan in 2014. The 2022 Strategic Compass puts EU maritime security, joint capability development, and interoperability high on the agenda. The development of an EU Rapid Deployment Capacity reaction force of up to 5,000 troops should include maritime components. The Strategic Compass also commits EU countries to expanding the European Union’s Coordinated Maritime Presence concept, designed to enhance maritime security in fragile areas that are key to European interests. A pilot project has been tested in the Gulf of Guinea and is now fully operational. Consistent with the European Union’s Indo-Pacific strategy, which commits to “a meaningful European naval presence” in the region, member states have agreed to implement a second Coordinated Maritime Presence in the northern Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Compass also commissioned an update of the 2014 EU Maritime Security Strategy, complemented by an Action Plan, published in March 2023. It commits the European Union to stepping up its action under six strategic objectives: activities at sea, including through naval exercises; partnerships, including deepening EU-NATO cooperation; a leading role on maritime domain awareness; managing risks and threats; boosting capabilities; and education and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to support joint capability development, the European Union (through its member states) has sought to foster naval cooperation by means of PESCO and the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence. Initial financing is coming from the European Defence Fund as a means to lower development, construction, and maintenance costs while helping the development of harmonized standards. It is in this framework that the project to develop a European Patrol Corvette by 2030 has been agreed upon. Led by Italy, with the participation of France, Greece, and Spain, the project is set to deliver the first “EU-developed” vessel of its kind. Other PESCO projects also aim at developing technologies for the maritime domain. These include the Maritime Unmanned Anti-Submarine System, coordinated by Portugal, along with the project led by Belgium in cooperation with several other smaller navies for delivering semi-autonomous and autonomous underwater, surface, and aerial technologies for mine countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 2 tallies the numbers of combatant vessels available to major powers, as well as to supranational groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OBSTACLE: SCARCE INDUSTRIAL AND OPERATIONAL INTEGRATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The naval shipbuilding industry, with more than a dozen shipyards, is still one of the few defense sectors in Europe that has not undergone any major consolidation in recent decades. Industrial cooperation has proven challenging for Europeans eager to defend and promote their national defense industrial base. Each of the large shipbuilding countries has its own industrial champion, often partly owned by the state. Shipyards are usually large employers that generate a high return for the local economies. Disputes over the lead shipyard or difficulties in reconciling national requirements have therefore hampered several projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from PESCO, joint investments, procurement, and projects remain scarce. Europeans operate 29 different types of frigates and destroyers (compared to four in the United States) and 45 different offshore patrol vessels. There are only a few examples of successful integration, mostly between neighboring countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;France and Italy:&lt;/strong&gt; In 1992, the two countries launched the Horizon program, which led to the development and construction of nearly identical advanced destroyers for the French and Italian navies, allowing for a high degree of interoperability. They further agreed in 2002 to jointly develop the FREMM, which has become a competitive ship for exports. They also cooperated in the design of the Vulcano and Jacques Chevallier classes of fleet-replenishment oilers. In late 2019, the two national champions, Italy’s Fincantieri and France’s Naval Group, created their joint venture Naviris, which leads the European Patrol Corvette consortium.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belgium and the Netherlands:&lt;/strong&gt; The countries established a joint naval staff, based on the BeNeSam agreements, signed as early as 1948 and strengthened in 1995. They both operate the same Karel Doorman–type frigates and decided in 2018 to jointly build 24 vessels (including two frigates), worth €4 billion. They also agreed with Denmark to establish a joint command for their special forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United Kingdom and France:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to the ongoing FC/ASW project, the two countries have jointly developed the anti-ship missile Sea Venom through European missile manufacturer MBDA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other significant bilateral projects include the construction by German TKMS of six Type-212CD submarines, of which four will be delivered to Norway before 2030, integrating missiles from the joint venture between TKMS and Norwegian Kongsberg. The Volcano long-range ammunition developed by Italian Leonardo and German Diehl can also be mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The few multilateral examples include the Tripartite or Eridan mine countermeasure vessels developed by Belgium, France, and the Netherlands in the 1970s. Additionally, the small navies of the three Baltic states — Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania — have established a joint naval unit, BALTRON, with small bases in each country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the operational level, the European Union and NATO favor interoperability through their standing groups, operations, exercises, and joint drills. Beyond the European Union and NATO, however, some naval coalitions have been formed on an ad hoc basis. This is the case of the Joint Expeditionary Force ( JEF) assembled by the United Kingdom and based on an agreement with nine other European nations. Another example is the French-initiated European Maritime Awareness in the Strait of Hormuz project. Aimed at ensuring the freedom of navigation in the Gulf, it brings together seven other EU countries and is headquartered in Abu Dhabi, UAE. France also launched the European Intervention Initiative in 2018 in order to foster common strategic culture and develop the ability to jointly deploy quickly in case of crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, some navies sponsor exercises that usefully put increasing emphasis on high-end and naval warfare, such as the French-led Polaris or Italian-led Mare Aperto. It is worth noting that even though this level of integration between various national navies remains unparalleled when compared to other continents, it is yet insufficient to present a united and fully interoperable European force in case of high intensity conflict at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;critical-capability-gaps&quot;&gt;Critical Capability Gaps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Western European nations are investing in “high-end,” technologically advanced maritime equipment. While these capabilities are important, emerging adversarial cyber and space tactics make European states vulnerable. Traditional maritime assets and “low-end” proven capabilities will be critical in the event of conflict. Additionally, these assets will be able to conduct routine law enforcement at sea — operations such as anti-piracy, anti-trafficking, search and rescue, and sea lane and EEZ patrols — while also providing warnings and indicators to counter malign actions such as tampering with seabed infrastructure or potential gray zone operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has a broad technological competence and high capability in the integration of complex technological knowledge areas such as sensors, propulsion, electronics, weapons systems, protection technology, and lightweight construction. But due to their tardy awakening to the risk of renewed naval warfare, European navies are lagging in a certain number of critical capabilities and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-submarine Warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; NATO and the European Union need to ensure their anti-submarine warfare capabilities are ready to deter and deny any threat from a peer competitor. Investment in submarines is essential to control the undersea domain, to stand up to the acute Russian threat, and to have the ability to deploy to the Indo-Pacific theater to address the China pacing threat. The United Kingdom is making that investment with the Astute-class submarine, but others need to follow suit to have a critical mass at the European level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industrial potential to increase undersea capabilities exists, as seven nations have historical roots in submarine production: France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and Spain. France is the only European country to master the technology to build nuclear submarines but refuses to export such submarines for non-proliferation reasons. Industrial support and additional port facilities capable of offering maintenance can provide a much-needed strategic edge and control of the maritime environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, investments need to be made in undersea monitoring capabilities, following the model of the U.S. Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) network by placing hydrophone nets near critical infrastructure on the seabed. These networks, coupled with coordinated submarine, surface, and aircraft capable of combined ASW, can be instrumental. The United States will also need to share these warnings and indicators through intelligence centers that contribute to NATO and EU maritime domain awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uninhabited Vehicles:&lt;/strong&gt; In the war in Ukraine, uninhabited aircraft have proven effective on both sides of the battlefield. Expanding this capability in the maritime environment will bridge the gap between the high-end and low-end equipment. Air, surface, and undersea vehicles not only can bring kinetic effects but more importantly provide essential targeting and intelligence. As naval combat maneuvers will be increasingly “uncrewed,” uninhabited vehicles are likely to serve as linchpins for systems integration, including in terms of artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, or directed energy weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With few exceptions (the United Kingdom, France), national investments and PESCO projects are not enough to sustain competition with Europe’s main rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missiles:&lt;/strong&gt; The Ukraine war has revealed the critical importance of munitions stockpiles. According to Jeremy Stöhs, after years of downscaling, navies retain only a limited number of frigates and destroyers designed for air-defense tasks. These warships are comparatively lightly armed and lack the necessary number of battle force missiles and corresponding vertical launch systems (VLS) cells to conduct and sustain high-end naval operations effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seabed Warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; The seabed is critical to the European economy and way of life. NATO and the European Union therefore need to ensure that adversaries do not disrupt the free flow of commerce, energy, and data. Pipelines have already proven a target, but information-sharing networks or communications cables could be next. Admiral James Stavridis, former supreme allied commander of NATO, succinctly captured this resource war at sea: “There is now a vast critical infrastructure at sea, yet the United States and its allies have done precious little to prepare to defend it, including honing offensive skills to create real deterrence in the mind of any potential attacker.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure, training, and equipment required to adequately defend this vital network will take years to develop. While Russia has the same problems, it has already started to fortify its energy assets in the Baltic Sea and High North. NATO and the European Union do not carry the same threat to Russian undersea assets that Russia poses to NATO due to the alliance’s respect for the international rules-based order. Russia has been suspected of tampering with seabed lines of communication for years, especially at the transatlantic node that leads into France’s naval base in Brest. Creating redundancy in these vital lines of communication is one investment that could prove effective, especially with the increased accessibility of the Artic. For NATO, investment needs to happen immediately, with clearly defined tripwires across alliances and partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological Innovation:&lt;/strong&gt; Emerging and disruptive technologies have received considerable attention in the military planning of revisionist powers such as Russia and China, including quantum technology, hypersonic and conventional missiles, and directed energy weapons. The ideal modern warship should be equipped with a great number of cutting-edge sensors, countermeasures, and weapons that increase both its offensive and defensive capabilities, while relying on an advanced combat management system able to manage all systems and the incoming data — and to be connected to an integrated network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mine Countermeasures:&lt;/strong&gt; The use of mines is a tool that leverages uncertainty to deter an adversary with minimal assets. Russia has the largest quantity of mines of any nation — approximately 250,000 munitions — and knows that its Western competitors are bound by a prohibition against the use of mines. Russia would likely attempt to mine the shores of NATO allies in advance of an offensive operation. The alliance must be ready to immediately clear those waters and needs to invest in demining capability to ensure that freedom of navigation is maintained throughout the Euro-Atlantic area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accession of Finland and Sweden into the alliance will bring two highly capable military forces into NATO, whose strengths include mining and demining capabilities. The Gulf of Finland is a strategic sea lane for Russia into St. Petersburg and a strategic area for contested EEZ operations. Finland, alongside the alliance, will defend those waters and can contain the Russian naval and civilian vessels in port through offensive mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amphibious Readiness:&lt;/strong&gt; There is little recent familiarity of amphibious deployments among European navies. However, approximately 40 percent of the world’s population, or nearly 2.4 billion people, reside within 100 km of coasts, which will likely increase the needs for deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; A widespread issue among European navies is the lack of manpower needed to adequately operate and crew some of their current capabilities, or the ones they are investing in. This can have severe operational impacts as it can constitute an important hurdle to deployment. There is an acute need to plug gaps in terms of numbers and skills, through both recruitment campaigns and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above elements show that the European navies need to accelerate and expand their efforts, adapt to a rapidly changing environment, and be further rationalized and integrated. This last section lays out recommendations related to capabilities, tools, and governance, and it concludes by looking at what the United States could do to support these needed evolutions. This section purposely does not tackle geographical priorities, since the authors assume that European navies should in any event aim to have a global reach due to the rapidly changing security environment and the interconnectedness of challenges and threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;capacities-robustness-and-flexibility&quot;&gt;Capacities: Robustness and Flexibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for the higher end:&lt;/strong&gt; The diversification and intensification of challenges at sea call for increased investment in capabilities that will help Europeans cope with the whole spectrum of warfare. When pondering prioritization, this report suggests giving the priority to the higher end, for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of all the threats identified, “strategic competition” and the ensuing risk of modern naval warfare is the most “capacity intensive” and the one that can have the biggest impact on European navies. To sustain competition, European countries need to be able to have a deterrent presence at sea, and — if needed — to combat and ultimately prevail. High-end capabilities are what strategic competitors will look at when strategizing their approach to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-end equipped vessels are inherently multipurpose and can carry out several tasks. They are therefore fit for various kinds of security environments. In peacetime, they can serve as deterrent; be used for training, exercises, or routine maritime security operations; and easily switch to combat mode if required. Vessels dedicated to lower-end missions do not have this reversibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Higher intensity does not necessarily mean higher concentration. There is indeed a risk in concentrating budgets into high-end combat forces: that European navies become even smaller in numbers than they already are. To conjugate robustness and flexibility, modern European capabilities should be easily dispersible, stealthy, and agile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not underestimate mass:&lt;/strong&gt; Facing the proliferation of combat capabilities coming from competitors and rivals, it is essential that Europeans be able to assemble a robust and deterrent presence in different geopolitical hotspots simultaneously if needed. To concomitantly deploy sufficiently robust groupings in order to efficiently defend their interests in a multi-theater conflict, Europeans need to have a critical mass of available assets — with their partners when possible, but also on their own when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foster multi-domain approach and modularity:&lt;/strong&gt; Naval warfare touches perhaps more physical domains than any other kind of warfare, as it extends from space, through the air, onto the sea surface, underwater, and down to the seabed, not to mention the coastal areas that are stage to amphibious operations. As suggested by Jeremy Stöhs: “Defense planners should consider fusing together sea-, air-, land- and space-based sensors (including unmanned platforms) to establish more comprehensive C2 and Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) arrangements that allow joint, multinational forces to perform the full array of naval missions.” This multi-domain approach should be tested through training and exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modularity should continue to grow to easily switch between mission sets by bringing on or off compartmentalized capability, such as mission payload kits for specific threats (anti-submarine warfare, surface warfare, electronic warfare/intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance [ISR], air defense, and mine warfare, to name a few). “Bolt on, bolt off” capabilities could be created. For instance, with the changing ISR landscape, different nations can work at the speed of technology to field cutting-edge signals and intelligence-gathering mission systems. Interoperable systems that link into a variety of vessels can increase domain awareness — future capabilities could even see advanced weapons systems with the bolt on, bolt off design — advancing the concepts of containerized vertical launch capabilities but avoiding the legal minefield of making maritime vessels combatants. Modularity and the bolt on, bolt off concept come with their own risks. Primarily, in a contested environment, vessels may lack the ability to utilize facilities capable of changing payload kits. The second risk is that these concepts may not work for legacy platforms, likely requiring time and investment to field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beef up shore-based defense:&lt;/strong&gt; Russian and Chinese examples show an emphasis on land-based A2/AD to advance and secure interests in the maritime domain. As some Black Sea and Scandinavian states are already demonstrating, defense planners should enhance land-based aviation, anti-ship missiles, and coastal-defense missile systems (similar to those responsible for the sinking of the Moskva); sensors (including space-based assets); and cyber capabilities to secure European shores. This particularly applies to smaller states (the Western Balkans or the Baltic states, for instance), which should leverage the potential of AI, semi-autonomous and fully autonomous systems, and other disruptive technologies to deny adversaries sea control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get serious about industrial consolidation:&lt;/strong&gt; Europeans remain highly dependent on the United States for high-end capabilities, sensors, and logistical support. Although it is less a problem to be dependent on an ally than on potential rivals, Europeans first need to take their share of NATO’s combined effort to maintain a competitive edge. Additionally, in case of changes in trade and industry strategies from the United States, they need to be able to produce and procure their own equipment. This requires multiplying bilateral and multilateral cooperation. One key line of effort should be the integration and interoperability of unmanned assets through a “systems of systems,” which will be crucial in future operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make full use of EU instruments:&lt;/strong&gt; The PESCO framework, although still a fledgling project, has already shown its added value — such as with the European Patrol Corvette. This potential should be fully harnessed, especially when EU funds allocated to defense projects such as the recent European Defence Fund and the upcoming European Defence Investment Program are fully available, and hopefully significant enough to drive technological progress forward. New projects in the aforementioned “critical capability gaps” could be prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also applies to projects aimed at enhancing European readiness. As suggested by Daniel Fiott, a specific project could be dedicated to amphibious forces, “linking to existing and future [PESCO] projects such as ‘co-basing,’ amphibious assault ships, precision-guided munitions, high-speed craft, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and air power capacities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a European submarine:&lt;/strong&gt; Building on the experience of the European Patrol Corvette, Europeans should step up their ambition and consider the joint development of new critical capabilities, such as submarines. The following options could be envisioned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A high-end, European-made and EU-funded, new class of submarines.&lt;/em&gt; Industrial powers with a history of cooperation and national know-how on submarines could apply to existing (European Defence Fund) and upcoming (European Defence Investment Program) EU funds and think about the development of new capacities that could become flagships for European defense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An “AUKUS-like” partnership with a key Indo-Pacific partner.&lt;/em&gt; France and Italy could perhaps harness the close ties they developed respectively with India, including in the provision or development of critical capabilities (e.g., Rafale jet fighters, existing cooperation on submarines between Paris and New Delhi) to develop trilateral security partnerships comprising of an ambitious and meaningful industrial project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An effort to fill intra-European gaps.&lt;/em&gt; Countries with industrial capacities (Germany, for instance, with the Netherlands or Norway) could build coastal submarines fitted for the member states deprived of such capacities, such as the Baltic states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance-and-institutional-support&quot;&gt;Governance and Institutional Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think of an overarching coordinating structure:&lt;/strong&gt; Inspired by the Maritime Areas of Interest Coordination Cell of the EU Coordinated Maritime Presences, a light structure could be established to bring together European countries’ naval staff, along with representatives of NATO and the European Union, in order to coordinate deployments, engage in operational planning, or conduct exercises. It would allow the UK navy to participate in a European organization, and it would also be open for Cyprus and Turkey to join as long as they do not impose restrictions on other members. This body’s main aim would be to synchronize and deconflict respective efforts, with a view to ensuring a consistent and coordinated European presence at sea. Down the road, such a structure could evolve to bring closer doctrines, tactics, and strategic thinking more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand information fusion:&lt;/strong&gt; Maritime situational awareness is a key enabler for European navies. Integration is underway through the Maritime Surveillance (MARSUR) project, which is a technical solution that allows dialogue between maritime information systems and is provided to 18 member states plus Norway and the United Kingdom. Building on this effort, Europeans should aim at a comprehensive and performative shared platform able to integrate upcoming technological innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance political-military approach:&lt;/strong&gt; Deployment strategies should be more concerted between defense and foreign affairs ministries to maximize their strategic effect. This applies at the national level, as well as for bilateral or multilateral efforts, such as the commitment by France and the United Kingdom during the March 2023 bilateral summit to coordinate their carriers’ deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximize effects through partnerships:&lt;/strong&gt; Investing in navy-to-navy partnerships can prove highly beneficial to Europeans for several reasons. As European nations will struggle to significantly expand their global presence at sea in the short to medium term, engaging in operational cooperation is paramount to develop interoperability, to offset the European absence in certain regions, and ultimately to build new coalitions to tackle shared challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, European navies still have a lot of expertise to share and should emerge as the key partners of major regional powers, especially those who are wary of too close cooperation with the United States and are being courted by China and Russia — such as Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Indonesia, or Malaysia. Finally, building sound and confident relationships with countries along key sea lines of communication, such as Egypt, the UAE, India, and Singapore, can prove instrumental to providing against potential disruption attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-the-united-states-can-and-should-do-to-help&quot;&gt;What the United States Can and Should Do to Help&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States remains the centerpiece of NATO’s maritime forces. It therefore has a pivotal role to play in leading by example and increasing European navies’ joint warfighting readiness. It should at the same time encourage European navies to be more responsible and more credible on their own, to make sure that they are able to do their share in defending the international rules-based order everywhere on the planet. Recently, the U.S. Navy used the Italian FREMM design to invest in the new Constellation-class guided-missile frigate (FFG 62), modifying it to meet U.S. standards and navigating congressional restrictions on utilizing U.S. manufactured frigates. Despite the balance struck, this $5.5 billion contract in collaboration with a foreign ally strengthens the bond between countries, may increase interoperability, and shows other nations that filling critical capability gaps in a timely, cost effective way can outweigh national interests. In the future, that message and encouragement across NATO and the European Union will be critical to ensure that defense spending in European nations remains at a level that can support broader objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sjO3VZu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第57天。認罪被告林景楠今接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問，同意2020年3月曾獲沈旭暉聯絡邀請參選立法會功能組別，林並曾提名何桂藍參加初選。惟林於6月發文稱「面對制度敗壞」決定不參選進出口界，改為參選新界東，他盤問下指會定義自己為「非建制」，並解釋進出口界選民多為建制派、他勝算不大，支持他的市民亦無法在該界別投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官質疑，法律界大部分選民為民主派又是否「敗壞」，林指進出口界多年均在無競爭下由建制派當選，且成為該界別選民並不容易，加上當時社會氣氛故使用「咁強硬」的字眼。林承認於新東初選表現不佳，而其後再宣布參選進出口界，是受朋友游說既然無人參加，而他有資格，「不如試一試」，但認為自己勝算不大。林亦指，不曾出席任何地區協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方應辯方要求傳召認罪被告林景楠&quot;&gt;控方應辯方要求傳召認罪被告林景楠&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上周相繼確診的施德來和彭卓棋，今早仍快測陽性，獲安排於延伸庭就坐，3名法官均配戴口罩。主控羅天瑋表示，將應辯方要求傳召林景楠接受盤問。獲准保釋的林景楠戴深藍色口罩、身穿白色襯衫和黑色西裝從正庭門口入庭，延伸庭的黃之鋒、馮達浚均發笑，馮其後不停與袁嘉蔚討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林在主問下確認他是於香港出生的商人，並已就本案認罪。法官陳慶偉續問誰希望發問，過了數秒後代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 站起身，指正等待看有沒有人會問，但似乎只有他有問題要問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林同意沈旭暉3月聯絡參選功能組別惟無提初選-後宣布參選進出口界&quot;&gt;林同意沈旭暉3月聯絡參選功能組別惟無提初選 後宣布參選進出口界&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在 Beel 盤問下，林景楠同意於今年1月19日及26日錄取兩份證人供詞。辯方問，他是否於2020年3月獲沈旭暉聯絡參與功能組別初選，他同意，惟在辯方追問下指「我當時嘅認知其實就有關於功能組別，就冇關於初選嘅」，指沈並無提過初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續展示林1月26日供詞，提及「大約在2020年3月，沈旭暉透過 WhatsApp 聯絡我，希望我可以參加初選功能組別」，林主動指供詞亦提到3月28日沈主持的協調會議「主要係傾有咩人出嚟參與初選嘅功能組別」，指此兩處均出現「初選」，解釋相信「當時嘅警員輸入錯咗，而我冇即時提醒返佢」，重申與沈的溝通「冇提過任何初選嘅嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林同意，與沈旭暉接觸後，於2020年3月4日宣布參選功能組別，並於3月28日於新蒲崗出席由沈主持的功能組別協調會議，但除沈外不記得其他與會者。他同意會上討論誰參加功能組別，但無關初選，印象中也沒討論民主派當選後會做什麼；會上也清楚是由他參選進出口界別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林同意曾支持何桂藍參選-惟翌日問區諾軒可否轉為選新東&quot;&gt;林同意曾支持何桂藍參選 惟翌日問區諾軒可否轉為選新東&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林景楠在盤問下同意，於6月18日曾於 Facebook 發文支持提名何桂藍參加初選，他亦有提名何桂藍，而當時他仍有意參選功能組別。不過到了6月19日，林聯絡區諾軒問可否轉為參選新界東。林確認此前與區有聯絡、區知道他有意選進出口界，而林亦知道要有盡量多民主派在功能組別勝出，才能達致立會過半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問區沒有嘗試游說他繼續參選功能助別？林指「佢有希望我留低，但冇好積極游說」，並同意他其後與戴耀廷就此事討論，區並告訴他可參與新界東初選，着他聯絡趙家賢準備提名，林並於6月20日宣布不會參選功能組別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾指進出口界制度敗壞故不參選-解釋屬小眾選民屬建制派&quot;&gt;曾指進出口界「制度敗壞」故不參選 解釋屬「小眾」、選民屬建制派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續展示林景楠當日帖文，提及「面對制度敗壞，我決定“不會”參選2020年立法會功能組別的進出口界選舉」，問「制度敗壞」是什麼意思。林解釋，當時接觸到很多地區選民，他們不能在功能組別投票給他，故認為是「制度問題」。法官李運騰問即他在地區直選的勝算比功能組別大？林指「法官大人，係有一定咁嘅諗法嘅」，但重申最主要是支持他的市民不能在功能組別投票，故他選擇參與地區直選，同意他在進出口界沒機會勝出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 追問「敗壞」的意思，是否指制度本質上不公。林指字面上的演繹，就是功能組別「一直以來都係一啲指定嘅、或者合資格嘅選民先可以投票，但只屬於小眾嘅」。Beel 問他當時會否形容自己為民主派，林答「如果要我去定義自己呢，我會定義自己係非建制」。Beel 再問進出口界是否建制派才可勝出？林指據他當時所知，該界別選民基本上都是一些商會的成員，他們都是建制派人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官質疑敗壞建基政治立場-林指進出口界無競爭下當選因社會氣氛用強硬字眼&quot;&gt;法官質疑「敗壞」建基政治立場 林指進出口界無競爭下當選、因社會氣氛用強硬字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，所以林指功能組別制度敗壞，只是因為選民大部分為建制派，若以同一邏輯，地區直選傾向支持民主派，那也是敗壞了？此時何桂藍微笑。林解釋是考慮到選民的數字。法官陳慶偉續指，林提到制度敗壞，是認為制度不公，因選民大部分來自建制派，林答「係嘅法官大人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳續笑着以法律界為例，指大部分選民來自民主派，多年來亦由民主派當選，他又會否形容該組別為敗壞？林指「我聽到你嘅諗法嘅法官大人，或者我加多少少自己嘅諗法」，解釋當時看到進出口界過去四屆立法會選舉均在無競爭情況下由建制派當選，加上要成為該界別選民並不容易，「唔係自己本身有做相關業務就可以成為選民」，故形容為制度問題。而他當時使用「敗壞」兩字，「我相信都係嗰陣時嘅社會氣氛，所以我用咗一個咁強硬嘅字眼。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林解釋參選新東因在該區長大與何桂藍同區承認政治觸覺都幾差&quot;&gt;林解釋參選新東因在該區長大、與何桂藍同區承認「政治觸覺都幾差」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林景楠續同意，於6月20日宣布參選新界東初選。李運騰問這區有他支持的何桂藍參選，他為何選擇參選新界東？林指「首先我想承認自己啲政治觸覺其實都幾差嘅」，並指他參選新界東，是因他自小在該區長大、是該區選民，而他作為商人當時在新界東有約7間分店，故經常會在該區與市民和顧客溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 並指，帖文亦提及「功能組別、議會制度上的不堪」，問是什麼意思。惟陳慶偉打斷指已問過相關問題，不認為需重複，又指知道這基本上是小圈子選舉，而且合資格選民有限，因而有不公的情況，「我想我們全都明白。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，林在帖文亦提到「議會上議員放棄投票」是他轉為選地區直選的主因，林解釋是指非建制派議員。他不太記得當時他們就什麼議案棄權，但「我自己覺得議員係應該有佢哋嘅取態，而唔係投棄權票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林稱朋友游說下重返進出口界參選-但截止日才獲足夠提名&quot;&gt;林稱朋友游說下重返進出口界參選 但截止日才獲足夠提名&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在 Beel 盤問下，林承認自己在7月初選的成績不佳，得票排名無法進入頭7位，其後他在7月27日於 Facebook 再宣布參選進出口界。李運騰問到，為何選擇重返他早前形容為「敗壞」的進出口界？林解釋，因獲身邊其他朋友游說，「既然都無人參加，而我有資格參加，咁不如試一試啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再追問，林認為最重要的是否勝出，而非制度是否「敗壞」，林表示重返進出口界參選「係唔容易嘅」，因「我印象中到（發文）嗰一日，其實我都未有足夠提名票」，並在截止報名日期前才剛好獲得足夠的10票，即10個提名人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林認自己無機會於進出口界勝出不曾出席地區協調會&quot;&gt;林認自己無機會於進出口界勝出、不曾出席地區協調會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到進出口界約有多少個選民，林表示應該有數千個選民或團體合資格投票。Beel 問到林參選時，是否現實地（realistically）認為自己不會勝出，林回答：「我認為自己係冇乜機會勝出嘅」，Beel 表示已完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，在李運騰提問下，林確認於6月20日才決定由功能組別轉為於地區直選參選，而在這天之前他並無出席任何地方選區的協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林作供約50分鐘便由警員護送離開法庭，並乘車離開，他在不足一小時內曾9度稱「法官大人」。控方其後傳召證物鏈相關警員作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/buMBb1S.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第57天。控方傳召負責網上蒐證的國安處警員馮小敏作供，她供稱2020年7月初選舉行前獲指示調查網上有關35+初選的資料，並因過程中知道戴是初選的「主要人物」而着重調查他。馮同意，其隊伍共用一個名為「鄧奇」的 Facebook 帳戶，「鄧奇」是假名，她並以此帳戶進行截圖。辯方展示警方截圖，顯示戴耀廷7月回應中聯辦譴責初選違法的帖文下，「鄧奇」曾留言「唔犯法都等天收啦你!!!!!」，馮指沒印象發出此留言，但承認該帳戶只是由警員使用。法官問，該留言是否可引致和激起（provoke）其他人的留言，馮答「冇錯」。不過據記者觀察，相關帳戶在馮作供後數小時已變為無法查看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;女警指初選前獲訓示調查網上資料-但無提及特定人物&quot;&gt;女警指初選前獲訓示調查網上資料 但無提及特定人物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林景楠今早接受辯方盤問後，控方傳召負責網上蒐證的國安處偵緝女警員16117馮小敏作供。馮供稱，她於2013年加入警隊，自2020年7月駐守國安處至今，就本案她獲指示到網上搜集有關社交媒體及影片的證據。她確認自己負責下載及保存相關記錄，當中包括媒體報道和戴耀廷的文章，如戴在《蘋果日報》撰寫的「立會奪半」文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馮稱，於2020年7月頭收到女督察訓示，需在網上調查有關35+初選的資料。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 問到，她接獲訓示時初選已舉行還是正準備舉行，馮回應：「我嘅印象係進行式，即係35+選舉同時間進行緊。」李運騰問到是於7月11至12日的初選之前或之後，馮表示是之前。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 追問督察的訓示內容是否予她印象有罪案發生（a crime has taken place），馮表示督察只是叫他們「多加留意」35+初選，並需要他們在網上各方面的媒體調查，以看看有否違反《國安法》。被問有否指定看《國安法》前或後的內容，馮指有關初選的資料都要搜查；亦無獲指示調查特定的人物名字，只要是與初選相關的任何人物都會調查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;女警指得知戴耀廷為初選主要人物故着重調查&quot;&gt;女警指得知戴耀廷為初選「主要人物」故着重調查&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後問，馮有沒有獲指示調查與戴耀廷相關的資料，馮表示起初只是調查35+初選的相關人物，而在調查期間知道戴是初選中的「主要人物」，因此就着重調查有關資料，但她並無檢視屬於戴的電子器材。馮曾檢視戴的 Facebook 帖文，但無聯絡 Facebook 服務商以調查帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到有否搜集證據顯示戴是帖文的作者，馮表示因見到戴耀廷的帳戶名後面有藍剔，以其理解是代表官方身份認證，但同意若任何人有戴的帳戶資料，該人可以登入其帳戶。馮亦負責搜集《蘋果日報》電子版中戴所撰寫的文章，但她沒有聯絡《蘋果》以確認文章作者是否戴。馮另確認不知道 YouTube 等網上影片是如何出現，以及內容有否經過編輯或改動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;女警確認隊伍共用fb帳戶鄧奇-截圖顯示曾於戴耀廷帖文留言唔犯法都等天收啦你&quot;&gt;女警確認隊伍共用FB帳戶「鄧奇」 截圖顯示曾於戴耀廷帖文留言「唔犯法都等天收啦你」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉盤問下，馮確認她並非調查網上資料的唯一警員。馬問到「鄧奇」這個名字會否喚起她的記憶，馮表示記得這是她用作截圖時的 Facebook 帳戶，只是「暱稱、假名」，這時延伸庭的被告起哄並互相討論。馬問其同事會否使用「鄧奇」的帳戶截圖，馮表示有機會出現這個情況，「因為呢一個係我哋隊共用嘅一個 Facebook 帳戶嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬其後展示警方於2020年7月31日對戴耀廷 Facebook 帖文的截圖，截圖右上方顯示帳戶為「鄧奇」，馮承認自己會登入帳戶截圖。截圖顯示戴於7月14日發帖文，內容為：「中聯辦的聲明指我協調此次民主派初選是『典型的涉嫌犯法』，我必須嚴正地指出這指控是完全不合常理的。」馮確認是由她截取。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬其後展示該帖文留言一欄，顯示「鄧奇」於截圖的「一週前」發出留言：「唔犯法都等天收啦你!!!!!」，並置於留言欄的最頂。延伸庭的被告看到後驚訝高呼：「嘩！」，譚凱邦「哈哈」地大笑出聲，並一直瞪大雙眼，至於黃之鋒則震驚「O嘴」，袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒亦有大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問留言是否可激起他人留言-警冇錯&quot;&gt;官問留言是否可激起他人留言 警：冇錯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬問到這句留言是否由馮發出，馮立即回應：「我無印象」，但她承認只有警員而非其他人會使用這個帳戶。法官陳仲衡續問，該留言是否可激起（provoke）其他人進一步留言，馮答「冇錯」。馮作供完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查戴耀廷相關帖文，顯示相同字眼的留言於2020年7月17日下午11時32分，由帳戶「鄧漢其」發出，該帳戶有5名朋友，報稱於2014年9月開始在理工大學「建築科技及管理學（BTM）」就讀。不過據記者觀察，相關帳戶在馮作供後數小時已顯示為「目前無法查看此內容」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第57天。時任新界東選舉主任楊蕙心接受盤問，指2020年立會選舉提名期前，曾獲官員「特別提點」要考慮參選人言行會否令人懷疑不會真誠擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特區；而她在何桂藍報名後，獲政制及內地事務局提供其FB帖文，提及「義無反顧」反對《國安法》等，楊發信要求何解釋，何回應《國安法》多處牴觸《基本法》、衝擊司法制度和侵犯港人自由。楊指何的答覆「冇所謂啱定錯」，她亦沒有考慮參選人政治背景，但認為《國安法》已加入保障權利自由的條文，何桂藍的解釋不成立，亦清晰顯示她並非真誠支持特區維護國安，故決定DQ她。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方一度提出，政府有意DQ所有民主派，惟法官質疑問題誤導，因並非所有參選被告均被DQ。楊其後同意，就新東8名參選被告，她裁定楊岳橋等3人提名無效，其他人則因選舉延後而未作出決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;選舉主任楊蕙心稱獲提點-留意參選人言行會否令人懷疑擁護基本法的真實性&quot;&gt;選舉主任楊蕙心稱獲提點 留意參選人言行會否令人懷疑擁護《基本法》的真實性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早傳召認罪被告林景楠及負責網上蒐證的國安警馮小敏後，下午應辯方要求傳召時任新界東選舉主任楊蕙心接受盤問。楊於1998年加入政府，2020年7月任離島區民政事務專員，並於6月19日獲時任選委會主席馮驊委任為2020年立會選舉新界東的選舉主任，於7月接任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問下，楊確認此前沒做過選舉主任，只在立會功能組別選舉及區議會選舉擔任過助理選舉主任；並指2020年立會選舉提名期開始前，選舉事務處曾向所有參與的工作人員發出手冊，清楚解釋根據相關法例他們在選舉中需擔任的工作，事前亦舉行解說會解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問楊就參選人根據《立法會條例》第40(1)(b)(i)條，作出擁護《基本法》及保證效忠香港特區的聲明，有否接獲特定指示。楊表示「記憶唔係真係好清晰或好仔細，唔係完全記得好清楚」，只記得手冊有提醒他們依照法例要求工作。法官李運騰追問，就何謂擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特區，當局有沒有提供具體例子？楊表示以其記憶所及，沒有特別精確地提及如何處理該要求，但相關官員曾於簡介會「特別提點」他們，要考慮參選人言行有否令人懷疑其聲明的真確性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊收何桂藍提名表3日後發信要求翌日回覆-不覺時間不合理因要徵詢法律意見&quot;&gt;楊收何桂藍提名表3日後發信要求翌日回覆 不覺時間不合理因要徵詢法律意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在 Beel 盤問下，楊蕙心確認於7月22日收到何桂藍的提名表格，她3日後發信要求何就兩條問題作回應，涉兩則 Facebook 帖文，並要求她翌日下午兩時前回覆，否則會據相關資料決定提名是否有效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問給予這麼短的時間參選人回覆是否正常，楊指「呢個時間其實都唔係一個唔合理嘅時間」，因提名期於31日截止，「我哋剩低嘅時間都唔係太多啦」，而提問的內容也「頗為清晰」。楊又指，參選人回覆後也只剩數天時間，她除了自己考慮，亦要視乎情況徵詢法律意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊稱從政制局獲何桂藍fb帖文強調無考慮參選人背景只考慮言行&quot;&gt;楊稱從政制局獲何桂藍FB帖文、強調無考慮參選人背景只考慮言行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問如何獲得何桂藍的 Facebook 帖文，楊表示收到其提名表格後就徵詢同事，包括選舉主任辦事處、政制及內地事務局等；而何的帖文應是從政制及內地事務局所得。楊表示不記得政制及內地事務局提供文件的數量，但肯定全部都是可從公眾平台獲得的公開文件，並同意在她審視的材料中，只找到兩則是「有問題（problematic）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊供稱，在新界東的28份提名表格中，曾向4名民主派參選人發信查詢。Beel 問有否發信給建制派，楊強調「我冇考慮過個候選人背景是否民主派或者建制派」，只會考慮其公開言行會否令她認為沒有客觀意圖符合聲明的規定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊多番追問下同意裁何桂藍提名無效文件由他人草擬-自己同意並簽署&quot;&gt;楊多番追問下同意裁何桂藍提名無效文件由他人草擬 自己同意並簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，楊蕙心就取消何桂藍資格的決定有否索取法律意見，惟陳慶偉指不認為與案件相關，指現在並非對選舉主任決定進行司法覆核。Beel 其後展示由楊簽署、裁定何桂藍提名無效的信件，問是由她抑或他人所撰，楊指「文件係我參考咗法律意見之後，由我發出」。Beel 追問是由她發出還是撰寫，李運騰亦問是否由她草擬，楊僅重覆：「我只可以講，係參考咗法律意見之後由我去發出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李遂問，即有人草擬並由楊簽署？楊指「係嘅，可以咁講」。李再指，即有人草擬、楊閱畢後同意並簽署？惟楊指「我唔能夠直接咁講係定唔係」，指因草擬前亦有就個案的資訊、包括從參選人拿到的資料，與律政司和相關人士作詳細討論，惟李打斷稱不是指她簽署前無討論，只是想問是否有人草擬然後由楊簽署，楊再答：「個文件嘅內容係根據我嘅決定作出同考慮而草擬。」李不耐煩指兩者並無衝突，亦不是說她做錯，只是想節省時間，楊道歉稱：「係，對唔住，呢個我誤解咗你嘅意思。」李最後語氣稍重指問最後一次，不想再問，並問是否有人草擬文件後，楊同意並簽署，楊答「係」，鄒家成和何桂藍等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問是否反對維護國安-何桂藍不同意惟指國安法衝擊司法制度侵犯港人自由&quot;&gt;被問是否反對維護國安 何桂藍不同意惟指《國安法》衝擊司法制度侵犯港人自由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後展示楊蕙心向何桂藍發出提問的信件，以及何的回覆。其中問題一有關何於7月發表的「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」FB帖文，提到「義務反顧的反對國安法」，楊問是否顯示她原則上反對人大常委通過《國安法》，及反對香港特區履行維護國安的憲制責任。何回應不同意，並稱由於《國安法》「內容多處牴觸《基本法》條文，衝擊獨立司法制度、侵犯香港居民受《基本法》保障的各項自由，因此反對《國安法》的單方面頒布及執行」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，楊曾否考慮何的關注是合理（legitimate and valid）的，惟陳慶偉認為與案無關。Beel 指是關於其證人當時的思想狀態（state of mind），指何當時關心並認為要捍衛（upheld）《基本法》，惟陳慶偉指可留待陳詞，李運騰亦指選舉主任如何理解《國安法》無證據價值，她亦不能得悉何的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;選舉主任不信納何桂藍真心誠意支持維護國安但強調答案無分對錯&quot;&gt;選舉主任不信納何桂藍真心誠意支持維護國安、但強調答案無分對錯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，楊曾於DQ何的信中表示，認為她就問題一的回答並不真誠（genuine），問是什麼不真誠？楊解釋，因何表示「不同意」問題的前設，但之後的解釋完全走向另一方向，指《國安法》牴觸《基本法》條文、衝擊法治和侵犯人權自由；但正如楊在信中解釋，《國安法》已加入第4及5條保障香港居民據《國際公約》享有的權利自由、亦確保施行法例時會維護法治原則，因此不認為何的解釋成立，亦不信納她有客觀意圖真誠支持特區在一國兩制方針下維護國家安全。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰表示，所有人都有機會犯錯，包括法官、律師及政務主任，楊是指何在理解《國安法》上有錯，抑或指這並非其真誠的想法？楊強調選舉主任職能是裁定參選人是否合乎資格，而她發信就是想從何獲得直接資訊，以考慮她是否真誠擁護《基本法》，因此何的答覆「冇所謂啱定係錯」，只是看能否從她的答覆信納她有「誠意客觀的意圖」去符合聲明要求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指民主派會全被dq-官稱可指政府有秘密議程-惟其後指說法誤導&quot;&gt;辯方指民主派會全被DQ 官稱可指政府有「秘密議程」 惟其後指說法誤導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指問題是楊認為何的答案是否真確，惟主控萬德豪指與案無關，法官着楊避席。陳慶偉問 Beel 的用意，指即使楊的評估完全錯誤，那又怎樣？陳仲衡亦指本案並不取決於其決定是否正確。Beel 回應，想指出何桂藍的DQ是無可避免，因政府會DQ所有民主派，沒有人能成功參選，林卓廷說「吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，辯方可直接向楊指出其案情，即政府有一個秘密議程（secret agenda），要DQ所有民主派參選人，Beel 指他會這樣做。不過陳仲衡指楊蕙心只曾向4人發信，與 Beel 稱所有人都會被DQ的說法不同；Beel 回應據楊的供詞，是因選舉押後一切才停止。法官指那是另一議題並下令休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;休庭後，陳慶偉指 Beel 提到政府DQ所有民主派的秘密議程，「我認為不僅問得太遠，更是完全誤導（completely misleading）。」李運騰亦指 Beel 的說法與何的同意事實稱33名參選被告中，只有9人被DQ不符。Beel 重申由於選舉延期，大部分被告的資格尚未確定，李運騰指那是揣測，陳慶偉亦着 Beel 只問相關的問題，不要以誤導的方式指出案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍此時走近被告欄，法官向 Beel 指其當事人似乎有話想說。Beel 索取指示後轉述何稱，「秘密議程」的說法並非由辯方提出，而是由法官提出。陳慶偉指他的確有用該字眼，但 Beel 當時也同意。何繞着手並一度搖頭，再步回座位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊指何桂藍就問題一回覆已清晰顯示非真心誠意擁護基本法-故無需考慮問題二&quot;&gt;楊指何桂藍就問題一回覆已清晰顯示非真心誠意擁護《基本法》 故無需考慮問題二&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後再展示楊蕙心DQ何桂藍的信件，問她為何說明DQ理由時沒提及問題二。問題二是問何6月發表「墨落無悔」聲明書，呼籲公開簽聲明「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫特首回應五大訴求」，是否代表除非政府回應訴求，否則她會聯同其他議員否決所有政府法案及財政預算案。何回應「否」，並指自己將按《基本法》及《立法會條例》等履行議員職務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊解釋，當時是想何提供資料讓她考慮是否有真實客觀意圖擁護《基本法》和效忠特區，而何就問題一的回覆已非常清晰顯示，她不支持政府根據「一國兩制」方針履行維護國安的憲制責任，因此楊信納何並非真心誠意擁護《基本法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊並指，何就問題二的回覆「非常之簡短」，若要確立其意圖便要請她進一步提供資料，但由於問題一的答案已「好明顯印證咗我就住呢方面嗰個疑慮」，認為若再追問只是浪費時間，也不會影響其結論，故沒追問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊指不能單憑在fb說話沒考慮仔細解釋下判定意圖&quot;&gt;楊指不能單憑在FB說話、沒考慮仔細解釋下判定意圖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰關注，若參選人就問題二答「是」，會有什麼後果，楊指會令她信納參選人有意聯同他人為了推行政治訴求而濫用《基本法》賦予立法會的權力。Beel 問是否如任何人持有該聲明的立場就會被DQ？楊不同意，指因此要向何發信提問，清晰了解其真實意圖，因她不能單憑她在 Facebook 的說話、沒考慮她仔細解釋下判定她沒有此客觀意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊確認新東曾dq三人-其餘5人提名未完成處理&quot;&gt;楊確認新東曾DQ三人 其餘5人提名未完成處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就被DQ的參選人數量，Beel 展示楊今年1月的供詞，提及有8名來自新界東的參選被告，包括劉頴匡、何桂藍、楊岳橋、陳志全、范國威、林卓廷、鄒家成和馮達浚。李運騰關注馮達浚並不屬新東，劉偉聰指馮轉為報名新界東。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊確認，她曾向劉頴匡、何桂藍、楊岳橋和陳志全4人發信查詢，最終DQ頭3人，而陳的提名則處理中（pending）；至於後4人，楊指因選舉中止運作，故未就他們的提名是否有效作出決定，也未向他們發信查詢，指他們應較遲交提名表格，有部分表格甚至未完成初步審核。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問有否考慮陳志全其他場合發言-楊稱只掌握墨落無悔聲明&quot;&gt;被問有否考慮陳志全其他場合發言 楊稱只掌握「墨落無悔」聲明&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後由代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉盤問。楊同意，於7月22日收到陳志全的提名表格，5日後向陳發信，要求他翌日5時前回覆；至於另外收信的何桂藍、劉頴匡及楊岳橋3人，楊蕙心同於22日收到提名表格，3日後發信，3人翌日回覆，並於30日獲截提名無效。而選舉提名期於7月31日下午5時截止，政府同日晚上約8時半宣布立法會選舉延期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊同意，當時尚未就陳志全的提名作出決定，而她只曾就「墨落無悔」聲明向陳發問，關注他是否有意無差別否決政府議案及預算案，同意這是唯一一份她掌握的文件令她有此疑慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬問，楊當時有否考慮陳在其他場合如記者會、選舉論壇的發言，楊指她有留意到，但「我當時掌握嘅呢只係呢份文件」，並未參考其他場合或詳細研究陳的言論。她又指其他場合言論均由第三者或媒體傳達，未必很準確表述其意向，加上她沒辦法將參選人所有言論「全部睇晒」才提問，故認為「倚仗參選人第一身所作嘅聲明係最直接同最準確」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊指不會考慮參選人往績-指主要視乎對信件回覆&quot;&gt;楊指不會考慮參選人往績 指主要視乎對信件回覆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉其後展示陳的回覆，提及「我會沿用過去八年任期內的嚴謹態度，處理未來的財政預算案」。楊指知道一些陳的往績，但不是全程留意他在立法會的言行。被問決定參選資格時會否考慮往績，楊指不會，指她主要都是看陳就她提問和相關議題的回覆。馬問為何不考慮往績，楊未有正面回應，僅引上述句子指這是陳所聲稱的往績，「喺咁嘅基礎之下，我都冇任何理由要因為呢樣嘢而覺得佢冇呢個真實意圖去符合（擁護《基本法》的要求）」，並指就要否取消陳的資格「我未作到呢個結論」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳回應中亦提及，從來沒有說過會否決政府所有法案及議案，又指若政府願意訂立落實真普選的法案、全民退休保障條例、性傾向及性別認同歧視條例和同性伴侶法案等，「本人定必投票支持。」被問該部分是否也與往績有關，楊指不肯定，因這是假設的情況，惟相關法案並沒有出現過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方沒有覆問，楊作供完畢後由便衣警員護送離開。警員一度阻止記者跟隨楊進入升降機，楊其後疑乘車離去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審，控方將續傳召證物鏈相關警員。&lt;/p&gt;

It provides an unclassified overview of recent U.S. official force planning and intelligence data on U.S. Russian, and Chinese nuclear forces; and compares summary estimates of global nuclear and related missile forces by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, House of Commons Library, U.S. Congressional Research Service (CRS), Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Roual United Services Institute (RUSI), and Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its final section contains summary data on U.S. force improvement plans taken from the testimony of General Anthony J. Cotton, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, before the House Armed Services Committee on Strategic Forces on March 8, 2023, and on U.S. plans and strategy on the aspects of missile defense that affect the strategic balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its main purpose is to illustrate the extent to which nuclear forces have again become a key factor shaping international security, and some of the different ways that experts now portray the changes taking place in nuclear modernization and in the balance between the major powers. It shows that the balance between the major powers has shifted from the nuclear balance between the United States and Russia to one where China is emerging as a nuclear great power; and where important shifts are the shifts taking place in the strength and modernization of other nuclear forces like those of the United Kingdom, France, North Korea, Iran, Israel, India, and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;focusing-on-the-problems-in-estimates-based-on-unclassified-data&quot;&gt;Focusing on the Problems in Estimates Based on Unclassified Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, its summary comparisons of different expert assessments highlight the many areas where key data on nuclear forces and nuclear warfighting are not available or present major issues in terms of uncertainty or conflicting data. Such summary data can only illustrate a limited number of the different ways in which experts now estimate the nuclear balance, but the analysis draws upon some of the most respected unclassified sources now available to illustrate the range of data now available and its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This survey has been substantially updated and expanded as of May 2023 in response to outside comments and suggestions that reviewed an earlier draft, but the estimates it summarizes continue to change and evolve, and the updated data on force strengths in 2023 and on future modernization are especially uncertain. However, even a book-length comparison totaling some 200 pages must ignore much of the work done by the experts it draws upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source of each estimate is listed at the end of each summary, and full text of the work by national governments, Hans M. Kristensen. Matt Korda, Robert Norris, and others in the country-by-country Nuclear Notebooks published in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, in the SIPRI annual yearbooks, the various reports by the Congressional Research Service, and the reports by Claire Mills for the House of Commons Library are particularly helpful in comparing different countries, understanding the limits and uncertainties in such data, and the extent to which many estimates are dated, uncertain, or based on uncertain sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limits-to-the-coverage-of-this-analysis&quot;&gt;Limits to the Coverage of this Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other key limits to the data presented include the fact that the official data on U.S., Russian, Chinese, British, and French programs have consistently tended to underestimate the costs, technical, and delivery date risks in the actual modernization efforts. They also understate the probability of major changes in major national programs as countries deploy new systems warfighting capabilities and change their strategies. Estimates of future forces are also based on current plans that do not reflect in the impact of the war in Ukraine, the collapse of many arms control efforts, and ongoing increases in Chinese forces and tensions over areas like Taiwan and the Koreas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These serious uncertainties in the data that are available on nuclear weapons and delivery systems. Many of the data on the type of non-U.S. nuclear weapon — fission, boosted, or thermonuclear — and its yield are uncertain. So are the background data on the level of technical sophistication in designing the weapon, upgrades and serving of weapons over the years, and its reliability in a real-world delivery on target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data on the actual level of success in each country’s explosive tests of nuclear weapons and progress in weapons design are often uncertain, and so is progress in testing weapons designs using simulated weapons with low levels of enrichment remain classified — although both India and Pakistan are reported to have used such methods. The readiness of stored weapons is not assessed, and the ability to use existing weapons assemblies in missiles and other delivery systems that are normally assessed as having conventional warheads is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, the summary estimates of existing forces generally only reflect a limited portion of the history of their development, changes in declared national strategy, long-standing questions about the real-world success of given powers in developing advanced systems, the history of arms control efforts, and national nuclear politics. Many of these details are uncertain and debated at the expert level. The narrative summaries of national nuclear efforts in Wikipedia often provide extensive background in these areas but also have serious gaps, are often badly dated, and vary sharply by country in their coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uncertainties-in-data-on-delivery-systems&quot;&gt;Uncertainties in Data on Delivery Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few reliable estimates of the changes that most nuclear powers are making to their delivery systems, and much of the data focuses on the performance of individual missiles, aircraft, SSBNs, and potentially dual-capable systems, rather than the numbers to be deployed, actual deployment, and impact on war fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the data on non-U.S. missiles are based on estimates of range based on the type and size of the missile rather than actual flight test data. Estimates of accuracy are often based on the maximum capability of the guidance platform rather than actual missile tests; accuracy is not tied to reliable estimates of nuclear weapons yield, and no reliability data based on actual tests of even the missile system alone are normally available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data are lacking on the targeting and retargeting capabilities of given countries, and on their ability to retarget, launch on warning, and accurately detect and characterize nuclear strikes on their own territory and enemy territory, and characterize the difference between counterforce strikes on nuclear and other military forces, and countervalue strikes on civilian populations, key economic and infrastructure targets, and other critical nonmilitary and recovery capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;failing-to-examine-changes-in-warfighting-capability&quot;&gt;Failing to Examine Changes in Warfighting Capability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the unclassified data now available on nuclear capabilities focus almost exclusively on nuclear delivery systems and nuclear weapons, rather than analyzing actual warfighting capabilities, and the results of a possible nuclear conflict. The unclassified data on nuclear strategy often consists of little more than national political statements about no first use, a desire for arms control, and a focus on deterrence rather than war fighting — none of which may apply in a crisis and at a time when most of the U.S. and Russia nuclear arms control efforts have been canceled or have an uncertain future, China does not participate in meaning arms control negotiation, and smaller nuclear power make statements that are ambiguous and given no clear picture of what might happen in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source efforts to analyze the warfighting impact of actual nuclear exchanges largely ended after the collapse of the former Soviet Union, as most tactical and theater nuclear forces were withdrawn from active service, and as arms control seemed to create a truly stable balance of strategic nuclear deterrence. As a result, there are only a handful of credible data on how a nuclear war might now lead to given patterns of counterforce strikes against an opposing side’s nuclear and other military forces, and the impact of fall out and the countervalue impact of counterforce strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little recent unclassified analysis of how a nuclear war might lead to countervalue strikes against populations, economies, and recovery capabilities, and of the levels of damage and casualties that might result in a world with radically different economic structures and target bases from that exist at the time of the Cold War. There is also little meaningful open-source analysis of the shifts taking place in key aspects of vulnerability to nuclear attacks, like dependence on imports, manufacturing capability, and changes in the economic value of given cities, key infrastructure targets, and key industrial centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, only limited data are available on the major changes that have taken place in the ability to use space and other assets to provide reliable warning of attacks, analyze nuclear engagements in near real-time, change counterforce and countervalue targeting dynamically in near real time to reflect the actual course of nuclear exchanges, and assess the value of given counterforce and countervalue targets in both warfighting terms and in terms of recovery capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of open-source analysis of the changing nature of actual nuclear warfighting seems increasingly dangerous. China is emerging as a major nuclear power and radically changing the potential nature of nuclear warfare between the major powers. Past efforts to actually analyze nuclear warfighting ignore the fact that there are now three major groups of nuclear forces: the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, and China. This not only presents major problems in modeling the possible patterns in nuclear warfighting and escalation, but it also presents the problem for the United States that any exchange with only Russia or China would make the power that stayed out of the conflict the de facto winner in a major nuclear exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dual-capability-and-a-return-to-theater-nuclear-warfare&quot;&gt;Dual Capability and a Return to Theater Nuclear Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has shown that Russia is willing to make nuclear threats, and much of the arms control efforts in Europe and between the United States and Russia have now ended or have an increasingly uncertain future. China has so far refused to engage in arms control negotiations. The end result is that there is a major risk that the deployment of theater nuclear weapons, dual-capable delivery systems that can be armed with nuclear or conventional warheads, and strategic nuclear warheads with yields suitable for theater warfare will increase steadily in the near future. The analysis shows that smaller nuclear powers have remained a relatively limited global threat but pose a steadily growing strategic threat to given nations in their region. Proliferating states like Israel, North Korea, India, and Pakistan are modernizing and increasing their forces, and the potential nuclear efforts of nations like Iran illustrate the rising risk proliferation may pose in the future. North Korea has also been reported to have declared that it has already deployed delivery systems that have both nuclear and conventional warheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-key-areas-of-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Other Key Areas of Uncertainty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several other major areas of uncertainty that affect the estimates of nuclear forces in this summary analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One is proliferation. Key cases involve the steady rise in Indian and Pakistani near force capabilities, the uncertainties surrounding the real-world nuclear capabilities of Israel, North Korean efforts to develop and deploy ICBMs, and the risk of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons and its impact on the development of nuclear forces by Iran’s Arab neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another is the ways in which nuclear forces can be used in combat and the extent to which the ability to manage a nuclear war in near-real time is becoming far more dynamic. There has been almost no open-source discussion of the potential impact of space sensors, AI, and big data in radically changing the current and future ability to provide reliable launch-on-warning capability and real-time data on the exact nature of nuclear strikes and their effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These advances in technology may allow the managers of an actual nuclear war to rapidly retarget, shift in near real-time from counterforce to countervalue targets, and fight even the highest levels of nuclear combat dynamically in near real-time. These issues are now being publicly explored in designing forces for advanced forms of conventional Joint All-Domain Operations, but there has been little public discussion of how they might change the modernization of nuclear war fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A third area of uncertainty, as the 2023 edition of the ODNI’s Annual Threat Assessment highlights, is the risk that new forms of biological warfare pose a rising strategic threat and one that could be used anonymously and to produce a wide range of lethalities and economic and social effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fourth is the fact that most existing U.S. and Russian, and NATO and Russian, arms control agreements have either been halted or suspended, while China has not engaged in arms control negotiations with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fifth is the fact that the number of precision-strike theater and tactical missiles that are dual capable is steadily increasing, but there is no indication of whether U.S. and Russian tactical and theater nuclear weapons will be returned to active deployment in Europe or elsewhere, and whether today’s U.S., Russian, and Chinese “triads” will become a “quad” that includes theater and dual-capable nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, no reliable estimates exist of the future development and deployment of missile and air defense weapons capable of intercepting nuclear delivery systems, or of cyber, antisatellite, and other systems that can degrade the ability to escalate and conduct nuclear warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, as noted earlier, no reliable unclassified estimates seem to exist of the impact that counterforce strikes launched to destroy an opponent’s nuclear forces would have on the opponent’s civil population, economy, and recovery capabilities. Past studies indicated that the real-world difference between counterforce and counter value could be limited by fall-out and longer-term weapons effects in major counterforce exchange, but they are now seriously outdated. It should be noted that the comparative summary analysis in this report shows that few nuclear powers provide full national statements of their nuclear modernization efforts, the full spectrum of their current and future nuclear capabilities, and actual warfighting capabilities. Statements like “no first use” are matters of doctrine that any nation can declare and ignore in a crisis, and no nuclear state has declared possible limits to its uses of nuclear weapons, possible ways in which it might agree to halt nuclear escalation once it begins, and limits to its countervalue targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) was concluded during the last years of the Cold War and established comprehensive limits on key categories of conventional military equipment in Europe. It potentially could have limited conventional systems that could be used to delivery nuclear weapons. In 2007, Russia “suspended” its participation in the treaty, and on 10 March 2015, citing NATO’s alleged de facto breach of the Treaty, Russia formally announced it was “completely” halting its participation in it as of the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-strategic-command-summary-of-us-nuclear-modernization-priorities&quot;&gt;U.S Strategic Command Summary of U.S. Nuclear Modernization Priorities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adapted from statement of Anthony J. Cotton, Commander, U.S. Strategic Command, before the House Armed Services Committee on Strategic Forces, March 8, 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NUCLEAR COMMAND, CONTROL, AND COMMUNICATIONS (NC3):&lt;/strong&gt; The NC3 enterprise is essential to the President’s ability to command and control the Nation’s nuclear forces. Acknowledgement of this vital mission and the unique challenges facing NC3 modernization were the impetus behind the Secretary of Defense’s establishment of my role as the DoD NC3 Enterprise Lead in 2018. With these responsibilities and authorities, we are taking a holistic enterprise approach to develop and deliver the next generation of NC3 — a flexible, resilient, and assured architecture spanning all domains and enhancing strategic deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NC3 Next Generation / Modernization:&lt;/em&gt; The modernization of the NC3 enterprise underpins the nuclear triad and sustains assured command and control capabilities in the evolving threat environment. We are partnering with NC3 stakeholders in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and levying requirements on the Services to modernize all NC3 capability areas, integrating global nuclear forces with the means to provide strategic deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next five years, we will transition from Milstar to the Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite constellation, gaining greater capacity, survivable worldwide NC3 reach, and the ability to provide direction to our forces in degraded environments. Our national leadership conferencing, currently using a voice-only legacy technology, will transition to voice and video displays. In our warning layer, we are moving away from the Defense Support Program and towards the Space Based Infrared System to maximize warning time. Efforts are already underway on our submarines, E-6B aircraft, and bombers to replace previous generation radios with improved systems that are more resilient to jamming and other electromagnetic effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next ten years, the launch and use of Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared geosynchronous and polar satellites will replace legacy systems with a space-based missile warning constellation to detect and track threats around the globe. The Space Development Agency’s Proliferated Warfighting Space Architecture is aimed at building a constellation of satellites in low and medium earth orbit that can monitor maneuvering hypersonic missiles flying below the range of today’s ballistic missile detection satellites and above the radar of terminal-phase targeting systems. These satellites will complement other efforts to detect and track maneuvering hypersonic missiles that are difficult targets for current missile warning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will use polar satellite communications capability with the Enhanced Polar System Recapitalization program to provide message relay. Our submarines, E-6B aircraft, bombers, and missile fields will receive communication systems that increase survivability of weapon systems in a crisis situation. We are focused on achieving our vision — a modernized NC3 &lt;em&gt;enterprise that remains resilient, reliable, and available at all times and under the worst conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NC3 Cybersecurity and Technological Improvements:&lt;/em&gt; We have confidence in our ability to protect, defend, and execute the nuclear deterrent mission. The resilience and redundancies of the systems comprising the Nuclear Command and Control System, combined with ongoing cybersecurity enhancements, ensure our ability to respond under adverse cyber conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;E-4B Nightwatch:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The E-4B Nightwatch aircraft serves as the National Airborne Operations Center and is a key component of the National Military Command System for the President, Secretary of Defense, and Joint Chiefs of Staff. The E-4B recapitalization program — the Survivable Airborne Operations Center — will serve as the next generation airborne command center platform. In case of national emergency or destruction of ground command and control centers, the aircraft provides a highly survivable command, control and communications center to direct U.S. forces, execute emergency war orders and coordinate actions by civil authorities. For these reasons, we must continue to develop and deliver this platform on time to prevent any capability gaps associated with this important national asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;E-6B Mercury:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The E-6B Mercury accomplishes two missions: Emergency Action Message (EAM) relay to all legs of the nuclear triad (Take Charge and Move Out/TACAMO) and an alternate USSTRATCOM command center providing EAM origination and ICBM secondary launch capability (Looking Glass). E-XX is the follow-on platform to the E-6B airframe and will execute the TACAMO mission only. In coordination with the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment and the Joint Staff, USSTRATCOM and the NC3 Enterprise Center are conducting an evaluation of alternatives (EoA) to consider all missions and platforms to deliver the Looking Glass capabilities currently performed by the E-6B. Recommendations from the EoA should be available by mid- summer. We must complete recapitalization by the E-6B’s projected end of service life in FY38.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RECAPITAIZATION OF TRIAD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a once in every-other-generation event that will ensure we have capable forces into the 2080s to defend the U.S. homeland and deter strategic attack globally. I am closely monitoring the transition of our major programs: OHIO to COLUMBIA, D5 LE to D5 LE2, Minuteman III to Sentinel, B-2 to B-21, Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) to LRSO, and modernization of NC3 capabilities. It is essential to sustain our current platforms until new systems are at full operational capability. Correspondingly, we are coordinating with the Services on efforts to mitigate operational impacts should delays occur in the delivery timeline for new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LAND-BASED TRIAD COMPONENT:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The ICBM remains our country’s most responsive option for strategic deterrence. The Minuteman III (MMIII) force provides a responsive, highly reliable deterrent capability, supported by a secure command and control system. Geographically dispersed ICBMs deny potential adversaries the possibility of a successful first strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MMIII’s weapon system replacement, the LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM, will deliver MMIII’s key attributes while enhancing platform security, streamlining maintenance processes, and delivering greater operational capability needed for the evolving threat environment. Sentinel’s program scope and scale cannot be overstated — our first fully integrated ICBM platform includes the flight system, weapon system, C2, ground launch systems, and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sentinel program is pursuing mature, low-risk technologies, design modularity, and an open system architecture using state-of-the-art model-based systems engineering. Sentinel will meet our current needs, while allowing affordable future technology insertion to address emerging threats. USSTRATCOM is actively supporting the Sentinel engineering and manufacturing development process and looks forward to the first Sentinel developmental flight test. Sentinel will deploy with numerous advantages over MMIII and will provide a credible deterrent late into this century. Sentinel fielding is a whole of government endeavor. We appreciate continued Congressional support, both for Sentinel and sustainment of MMIII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEA-BASED TRIAD COMPONENT:&lt;/strong&gt; The Navy’s OHIO-class SSBN fleet, equipped with the Trident II D5 SLBM, patrols the world’s oceans undetected, providing an assured second strike capability in any scenario. Our SSBN fleet continues to provide a resilient, reliable, and survivable deterrent. However, the life of the OHIO-class SSBN fleet has been extended from a planned 30 years to an unprecedented 42 years. The average age of the SSBN fleet is now 32 years. As the hulls continue to age, the OHIO-class will face sustainment and readiness challenges until it is replaced by the COLUMBIA-class. Similar to Minuteman III, we must maintain OHIO-class hulls until the COLUMBIA is available. The Navy has already invested in the Integrated Enterprise Plan to shorten construction timelines for COLUMBIA hulls two through twelve to meet USSTRATCOM at-sea requirements. Continued investment in revitalizing our shipbuilding industry is a national security imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first COLUMBIA-class&lt;/em&gt; submarine must achieve its initial strategic deterrent patrol in FY31 with an initial loadout of D5 LE missiles and a steady transition to the D5 LE2. The program of record delivers at least twelve SSBNs — the absolute minimum required to meet sustainment requirements. A life-of-hull reactor and shorter planned major maintenance periods are intended to deliver greater operational availability. COLUMBIA will deliver improved tactical and sonar systems, electric propulsion drive, and advanced hull coating to maintain U.S. undersea dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Trident II D5 LE2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; program will field a modern, reliable, flexible, and effective missile capable of adapting to emerging threats and is required to meet COLUMBIA-class SLBM loadout requirements. Stable funding for D5LE2 is vital to maintaining program benchmarks and ensuring a viable SSBN deterrent through the 2080s. COLUMBIA’s ultimate success depends on a missile that is both capable and flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, shore infrastructure readiness is fundamental to supporting current OHIO-class SSBN and future COLUMBIA-class SSBN operations. Provision of military construction and operation &amp;amp; maintenance funding facilitates the Navy’s modernization of shore infrastructure supporting the nuclear deterrence mission. One immediate example is the modernization and expansion of the SSBN training and maintenance facilities in Kings Bay. These facilities are critical for maximizing the combat readiness of SSBNs and their crews daily, requiring a commitment to multiple years of funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-Submarine Warfare:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Anti-submarine warfare threats continue to evolve. The Navy’s Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS) provides vital information concerning adversary submarine and surface ship operations, enabling U.S. forces to maintain favorable tactical and strategic positions while supporting deterrent patrol operations. Surveillance performed by IUSS also provides the theater undersea warfare commander situational awareness required for maritime defense of the homeland. Advances in adversary submarine stealth underscore the importance of IUSS recapitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our submarines are formidable weapon systems; however, we must address potential adversaries’ anti-submarine warfare advances to maintain an effective and viable SSBN fleet well into the future. Adversary investments in submarine quieting, acoustic arrays, and processing capabilities may challenge our acoustic superiority in the future and consequently, SSBN survivability. Development and employment of advanced sonar sensors, advanced materials science and coatings, and other efforts within the Navy’s Acoustic Superiority Program are vital to maintain our undersea advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIR-BASED TRIAD COMPONENT:&lt;/strong&gt; The bomber fleet is our most flexible and visible leg of the triad. We are the only country with the capability to provide long-range bombers in support of our Allies and partners, enabling the U.S. to signal resolve while providing a flexible option to de-escalate a conflict or crisis. In a force employment model known as the Bomber Task Force (BTF), USSTRATCOM supports global deterrence and assurance objectives. BTFs allow dynamic employment of the Joint Force and clear messaging as potential adversaries watch these missions closely. As bombers conduct missions throughout the globe, they enhance national objectives by demonstrating unity with Allies and partners, and testing interoperability. As a complement to the Air Force’s Agile Combat Employment (ACE) concept, we must consider increasing forward-based maintenance capability to support persistent, episodic global presence while retaining the ability to increase nuclear readiness posture as needed. As we sustain legacy systems and field new capabilities, it will be important to invest in bomber support forces and infrastructure to adequately sustain flexibility and effective nuclear deterrence posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;B-52H Sustainment:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The B-52H continues on as the workhorse of our bomber fleet. The B-52’s longevity is a testament to its engineers and maintenance professionals, but it must be modernized to remain in service into the 2050s. Essential B-52 upgrades include the Commercial Engine Replacement Program (CERP), Radar Modernization Plan, global positioning system military code signal integration, and survivable NC3 communications equipment. These improvements will keep the B-52 flying and able to pace the evolving threat. CERP will replace the B-52’s 1960s-era TF-33 engines, which will enable longer unrefueled range, reduce emissions, and address supply chain issues afflicting the legacy engines. The B-52’s very low frequency and advanced extremely high frequency modernization programs will provide mission critical, beyond-line-of-sight connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;B-2 Sustainment:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The B-2 fleet remains the world’s only low-observable bomber, able to penetrate denied environments while employing a wide variety of munitions against high-value strategic targets. The DoD must protect this unique operational advantage as the Air Force transitions from the B-2 to the B-21 fleet. Successful transition requires full funding for B-2 sustainment and modernization programs until the B-21 completes development and certification for both conventional and nuclear missions, and is fielded in sufficient numbers to preclude any capability gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;B-21:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The B-21 Raider will provide both a conventional and nuclear-capable bomber supporting the triad with strategic and operational flexibility across a wide range of military objectives. The program is on track to meet USSTRATCOM operational requirements, and continues to successfully execute within cost, schedule, and performance goals. The B-21 will be the backbone of our future bomber force, providing a penetrating platform with the range, access, and payload to go anywhere needed in the world. Consistent funding of the Air Force’s B-21 program is required to prevent operational shortfalls in the bomber force and ensure delivery of this critical combat capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Air-Delivered Weapons:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The air-delivered weapons portfolio consists of the ALCM, the B83-1 gravity bomb, and the B61 family of weapons, providing a mix of standoff and direct attack munitions to meet near-term operational requirements. The ALCM provides current stand-off capability to the strategic bomber force, but is reaching its end-of-life. LRSO will replace the ALCM as our country’s sole air-delivered standoff nuclear capability. It will provide the President with flexible and scalable options, and is capable of penetrating and surviving against advanced air defenses — a key attribute and important component in USSTRATCOM operational plans. The LRSO is complementary to the ICBM and SSBN recapitalization programs and an important contribution to strategic stability. The B61-12 will soon replace most previous versions of the B61, providing a modernized weapon with greater accuracy and increased flexibility. Finally, USSTRATCOM is actively supporting the National Defense Authorization Act requirement to conduct a study on options to hold at risk hard and deeply buried targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tanker Support:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A robust tanker fleet is essential to sustaining global reach for all USSTRATCOM missions. The 65 year-old KC-135 is the backbone of the Air Force’s air refueling force but is facing increasing maintenance and sustainment issues. Limited air-refueling aircraft increases bomber response timing and constrains bomber deterrence posture agility. Concurrent mission demands between strategic, theater, and homeland defense require continued tanker modernization and expansion efforts. USSTRATCOM fully endorses and supports the Air Force’s effort to modernize and sustain the tanker fleet, including certification of the KC-46 to support the nuclear mission. A conflict with a peer adversary would put previously unseen demands on the tanker force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEAPONS INFRASTRUCTURE AND NUCLEAR SECURITY ENTERPRISE (NSE):&lt;/strong&gt; Today’s nuclear weapon stockpile remains safe, secure, and effective. However, our country has not conducted a large-scale weapons modernization in over two decades. Stockpile and infrastructure modernization must ensure our systems are capable of pacing and negating adversary threats to our Nation, Allies, and partners. Over the past five years we have made significant investments in the NSE, but most programs take a decade or longer to field a meaningful capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NNSA, as part of and informed by the Nuclear Weapons Council (NWC), has developed a comprehensive plan to put these identified capacities and capabilities in-place. When realized, it will enable our country to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons stockpile to meet strategic deterrence needs. In the interim, I look forward to working with NNSA and other NWC partners to find the best solutions to mitigate operational risks. I commend Congress for its support of the NNSA’s budget for weapons activities for FY23. Stockpile and NSE programs can take a decade or more to deliver and will require consistent, uninterrupted funding to provide the needed capacities and capabilities on time to sustain and modernize the strategic deterrent force. We must continue to look for ways to accelerate our stockpile and NSE modernization and recapitalization programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we shift focus beyond life extension to modernizing existing weapons and fielding new systems, we must overcome challenges that delay program execution. There are many NSE programs with just-in-time schedules or that are late-to-need, including pit production, uranium processing, and radiation case manufacturing. Failure to execute and deliver timely NSE modernization programs results in accumulation of operational risk by requiring the retention of aging weapons and components in the stockpile decades longer than intended. In FY22, the NSE took action on a number of issues impacting the readiness and modernization of the nuclear deterrent force. Some areas — for example, the W93, B61-12, and W88 Alt 370 — saw progress, while others such as the W80-4 and W87-1 stockpile modernization programs are experiencing milestone delays and increased schedule risk. I look forward to working with NNSA and other NWC partners to improve our rates of success in these latter areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production of essential components is a critical issue. NNSA has identified critical capability gaps affecting components essential for stockpile modernization. It is also vital that the NSE re-establishes a plutonium pit manufacturing capability of no less than 80 pits per year as close to 2030 as possible. Weapon production is a multi-decade task that must address current enterprise limitations as we simultaneously modernize the stockpile, infrastructure, and platforms while sustaining the current force until it can be replaced. For over a decade, our adversaries have dedicated significant resources to modernizing and expanding their nuclear capabilities. As our systems continue to age, funding a modern stockpile, supporting infrastructure, and a robust science, technology, and engineering base is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NUCLEAR SECURITY:&lt;/strong&gt; Nuclear security continues to be one of my top priorities; we will commit the resources required to protect our fielded weapons, weapon platforms, and personnel. Adhering to the Nuclear Weapon Security Standard ensures denial of unauthorized access to nuclear weapons and prevents loss of custody. A defense-in-depth strategy starts at every nuclear weapon and builds outward with a cohesive design to deter, detect, delay, deny, and defeat security threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MH-139A Grey Wolf Replacement Helicopter:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Joint Force achieved a significant ICBM security milestone with the Air Force’s award of a contract to replace the UH-1N helicopter fleet with the new MH-139A “Grey Wolf.” The MH-139A offers enhanced speed, range, endurance, payload, and survivability versus the UH-1N. We will continue to work with the Services to deliver this capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering Small Unmanned Systems: The rapid proliferation and growing technological sophistication of small unmanned systems is an increasing threat to the nuclear enterprise. To counter the threat, the Department continues to field Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS) capabilities and is refining tactics, techniques, and procedures. Similarly, the advancement of unmanned surface and underwater vehicles may soon emerge as a threat to our SSBNs and supporting infrastructure, requiring a comprehensive force protection system to defend both pier-side and in-transit SSBNs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weapon Generation Facility (WGF):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As we modernize nuclear weapons and platforms, the Air Force will replace aging weapon storage areas with new WGFs which are vital to security, sustainment, and fielding of the Sentinel, B-21, and LRSO triad modernization programs, and their associated weapons. The Air Force will conduct weapon maintenance, storage operations, and (as required) weapons generation activities in a single reinforced WGF facility at each strategic base. This will further increase security, recapitalize aging infrastructure, and enhance efficiency throughout the mission. The WGFs are a critical part of the larger nuclear modernization effort and must be fully funded to deliver on time in support of each program of record delivery schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOINT ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM OPERATIONS (JEMSO):&lt;/strong&gt; Per the Unified Command Plan (UCP), CDRUSSTRATCOM is responsible for advocating for JEMSO and electromagnetic warfare capabilities, providing contingency electronic warfare support to other CCMDs, and supporting CCMD joint training and planning related to controlling the EMS. Potential adversaries understand our dependency upon the EMS and have developed technology to effectively contest our use of it. Additionally, increased civil and commercial use of spectrum bandwidth significantly congests the EMS and constrains DoD use. Multiple USSTRATCOM assessments have identified JEMSO readiness shortfalls, which are growing. Our adversaries have dramatically increased their offensive and defensive capabilities in recent years; the DoD must similarly improve our ability to operate in a degraded electromagnetic warfare environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must continue to pursue a DoD-wide effort to achieve EMS superiority and mission. To support the goals of the DoD EMS Superiority Strategy, USSTRATCOM is executing twelve assigned tasks, including establishing an organization, led by a 2-star, called the Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Center (JEC). The JEC will lead execution of the eleven other USSTRATCOM assigned DoD EMS Superiority Strategy tasks. Additionally, USSTRATCOM has led development of JEMSO cells at other CCMDs to enable these functions. We are also working with the DoD Chief Information Officer to develop a software system for use by CCMD JEMSO cells in planning, coordinating, and controlling the EMS. Following multiple assessments from Northern Edge — USINDOPACOM’s tier 1 exercise — USSTRATCOM is pursuing accreditation authorities for Joint Force EMSO readiness that will help close capability gaps. USSTRATCOM is also establishing an EMSO training and education capability to coordinate DoD EMS joint training, streamline training processes, and promote standardization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISSILE DEFENSE:&lt;/strong&gt; Missile defense capabilities are a key part of integrated deterrence to deny our potential adversaries coercive abilities or the benefit of attacks against the homeland, Allies, and partners. The proliferation of missile technology and employment techniques designed to circumvent missile defenses demands a Department-wide missile defeat approach with continued investment in systems integration and collaboration with Allies and partners. This comprehensive approach uses the entire range of available activities to counter the development, acquisition, proliferation, and use of adversary offensive missiles of all types, as well as limiting damage from such use. An important element of this approach is integration of space- and terrestrial-based sensors for warning, attribution, and tracking of ballistic, maneuvering, hypersonic, cruise missile, and UAS threats to optimize the effectiveness of our limited inventory of kinetic interceptors. A comprehensive sensor architecture that gives commanders and civilian leaders situational awareness over all threats and incursions to our air and space domains is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MMIII’s weapon system replacement, the LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM, will deliver MMIII’s key attributes while enhancing platform security, streamlining maintenance processes, and delivering greater operational capability needed for the evolving threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sentinel’s program scope and scale cannot be overstated — our first fully integrated ICBM platform includes the flight system, weapon system, C2, ground launch systems, and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sentinel program is pursuing mature, low-risk technologies, design modularity, and an open system architecture using state-of-the-art model-based systems engineering. Sentinel will meet our current needs, while allowing affordable future technology insertion to address emerging threats. USSTRATCOM is actively supporting the Sentinel engineering and manufacturing development process and looks forward to the first Sentinel developmental flight test. Sentinel will deploy with numerous advantages over MMIII and will provide a credible deterrent late into this century. Sentinel fielding is a whole of government endeavor. We appreciate continued Congressional support, both for Sentinel and sustainment of MMIII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HYPERSONIC WEAPONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Long-range conventional hypersonic weapons will provide senior leadership additional strike options to hold distant and/or defended high-value, time-sensitive targets at risk without crossing the nuclear threshold. Conventional HSWs ensure long-range power projection in contested environments and enables more efficient and effective application of the nuclear force. While HSWs are not a replacement for nuclear weapons, these systems show promise as the conventional complement that the nuclear force needs to expand integrated deterrence options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to quickly strike defended targets at long range is an important capability that the Joint Force and multiple CCMDs require. Rapid development and fielding of conventional HSWs is a top USSTRATCOM priority. The goal of fielding the first offensive hypersonic strike system is on the horizon with the Army scheduled to field a Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon battery in late 2023, followed by the Navy Conventional Prompt Strike program beginning in the mid-2020s. The Air Force has demonstrated successes in the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon program and hypersonic cruise missile technology pathfinder efforts. A robust scientific and industrial base is vital to ensure that HSWs are fielded in sufficient quantities. Additionally, a program for continuous technological improvement is important to meet the evolving security environment over the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USSTRATCOM is committed to ensuring HSWs are ready to employ on day one of fielding as these weapons directly contribute to USSTRATCOM’s UCP-assigned strategic deterrence and global strike responsibilities. To operationalize these new capabilities in the near term, we are working across the Department to develop a concept of operation for HSW support to integrated deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USSTRATCOM is working through policy, planning, and C2 processes, and — in conjunction with the Services and other CCMDs — is testing HSWs through a rigorous exercise program. Hypersonic weapons will have an immediate impact to operational plans by deterring and holding adversaries at risk while providing the nation with credible, strategic, non-nuclear response options when faced with armed conflict. Additionally, HSW-related agreements with Allies will further reinforce collective security, promote interoperability, and facilitate optimal deployment of these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-nuclear-strategy-and-missile-defense&quot;&gt;U.S. Nuclear Strategy and Missile Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Missile Defense Strategy and Nuclear Forces: 2022 Missile Defense Review.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.defense.gov/2022/Oct/27/2003103845/-1/-1/1/2022-NATIONAL-DEFENSE-STRATEGY-NPR-MDR.PDF&quot;&gt;Department of Defense: 2022 Missile Defense Review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As outlined in the NDS, integrated deterrence is a framework weaving together all instruments of national power — with diplomacy at the forefront — to work seamlessly across warfighting domains, theaters, the spectrum of conflict, and our network of alliances and partnerships. Tailored to specific circumstances, integrated deterrence applies a coordinated, multifaceted approach to reducing competitors’ perceptions of the net benefits of aggression relative to restraint. Integrated deterrence is enabled by combat-credible forces and backstopped by a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missile defenses, as one component of this integrated, multilayered framework, are critical to the top priority of defending the homeland and deterring attacks against the United States. Whether protecting the homeland, deployed U.S. forces, or our Allies and partners, missile defenses deny the benefits of an attack by adversaries and limits damage should deterrence fail. The continued evolution and progress of missiles as a principal means by which adversaries seek to project conventional or nuclear military power makes missile defense a core deterrence-by- denial component of an integrated deterrence strategy. Missile defense capabilities add resilience and undermine adversary confidence in missile use by introducing doubt and uncertainty into strike planning and execution, reducing the incentive to conduct small-scale coercive attacks, decreasing the probability of attack success, and raising the threshold for conflict. Missile defenses also reinforce U.S. diplomatic and security posture to reassure Allies and partners that the United States will not be deterred from fulfilling its global security commitments. In the event of crisis or conflict, missile defenses offer military options that help counter the expanding presence of missile threats, and may be less escalatory than employing offensive systems. Damage limitation offered by missile defenses expands decision making space for senior leaders at all levels of conflict, and preserves capability and freedom of maneuver for U.S. forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the framework of integrated deterrence, missile defense and nuclear capabilities are complementary. U.S. nuclear weapons present a credible threat of a robust response and overwhelming cost imposition, while missile defenses contribute to deterrence by denial. If deterrence fails, missile defenses can potentially mitigate some effects from an attack. Missile defense contributes directly to tailored U.S. deterrence strategies to dissuade attacks on the United States from states like North Korea, and contributes to extended deterrence for U.S. Allies and partners, and our respective forces abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address intercontinental-range, nuclear threats from Russia and the PRC, the United States will continue to rely on strategic deterrence — underwritten by safe, secure, and effective nuclear forces — to deter such threats as outlined in the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). Ensuring the continued credibility of this deterrent will require investments in missile warning, missile tracking, and resilient NC3 to keep pace with the evolving PRC and Russian threats, and avoid the possibility of evading U.S. sensor networks in a surprise attack. For states like North Korea, missile defenses and the U.S. nuclear arsenal are complementary and mutually reinforcing, as both capabilities contribute to deterring an attack against the United States and our Allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homeland Missile Defense.&lt;/strong&gt; The Department’s top priority is to defend the homeland and deter attacks against the United States. For the purposes of this review, homeland missile defense refers to the defense of the 50 states, all U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia against missile attacks. Missile defenses can raise the threshold for initiating nuclear conflict by denying an aggressor the ability to execute small-scale coercive nuclear attacks or demonstrations. Further, the presence of missile defense complicates adversary decision-making by injecting doubt and uncertainty about the likelihood of a successful offensive missile attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missile defense systems such as the GMD offer a visible measure of protection for the U.S. population while reassuring Allies and partners that the United States will not be coerced by threats to the homeland from states like North Korea and potentially Iran. In the event of crisis, globally integrated domain awareness capabilities increase warning and allow for flexible decision-making to respond, as necessary and appropriate, with escalatory options such as kinetic strike. Should deterrence fail, missile defenses can help mitigate damage to the homeland and help protect the U.S. population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. homeland ballistic missile defense architecture centers on the GMD system, consisting of interceptors emplaced in Alaska and California, a network of space-based and terrestrial-based sensors, and an integrated C2 system. Together, these U.S. homeland defense capabilities provide the means to address ballistic missile threats from states like North Korea and Iran. Though the United States maintains the right to defend itself against attacks from any source, GMD is neither intended for, nor capable of, defeating the large and sophisticated ICBM, air-, or sea- launched ballistic missile threats from Russia and the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States relies on strategic deterrence to address those threats. As part of an integrated approach to deterrence, the United States recognizes the interrelationship between strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive systems. Strengthening mutual transparency and predictability with regard to these systems could help reduce the risk of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As North Korean ballistic missile threats to the U.S. homeland continue to evolve, the United States is committed to improving the capability and reliability of the GMD system. This includes development of the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) to augment and potentially replace the existing Ground-Based Interceptors (GBI). In addition to the GMD system, the United States will leverage and improve its full spectrum of missile defeat capabilities, complemented by the credible threat of direct cost imposition through nuclear and non-nuclear means, to continue to counter North Korean missile threats to the homeland. To deter attempts by adversaries to stay under the nuclear threshold and achieve strategic results with conventional capabilities, the United States will examine active and passive defense measures to decrease the risk from any cruise missile strike against critical assets, regardless of origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the context of homeland defense, an attack on Guam or any other U.S. territory by any adversary will be considered a direct attack on the United States, and will be met with an appropriate response. Additionally, Guam is home to key regional power projection platforms and logistical nodes, and is an essential operating base for U.S. efforts to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific region. The architecture for defense of the territory against missile attacks will therefore be commensurate with its unique status as both an unequivocal part of the United States as well as a vital regional location. Guam’s defense, which will include various active and passive missile defense capabilities, will contribute to the overall integrity of integrated deterrence and bolster U.S. operational strategy in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional Missile Defense.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States will continue to strengthen defenses for U.S. forces, and with Allies, and partners against all regional missile threats from any source. As part of an integrated, interoperable, and multi-layered approach to deterrence, IAMD capabilities need to keep pace with expanding regional missile threats, while protecting and enabling U.S., Allied, and partner maneuver forces to conduct operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional missile threats continue to expand in capability, capacity, and complexity, challenging existing U.S., Allied, and partner regional IAMD capabilities and placing all at risk. Likely designed for employment below the U.S. nuclear threshold, adversaries are pursuing and demonstrating advanced, long-range space and missile systems capable of traversing entire Combatant Command Areas of Responsibility (AORs). Attacks from these systems could increasingly blur the line between regional and homeland defense and challenge existing IAMD architectures. In addition to missile threats, U.S. forces, Allies and partners also face the proliferation of lower-tier threats (e.g., rockets, armed UAS, etc.) as adversaries seek to take advantage of these relatively inexpensive, flexible, and expendable systems while exploiting inherent difficulties with attribution and its implications for deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation with like-minded nations is crucial. The United States will continue to seek ways to integrate and interoperate with Allies and partners as well as encouraging greater integration among Allies and partners to fill gaps against the increasing spectrum of regional threats. Additionally, as the ability to share sensor information and data is critical to regional defense, the United States will continue to streamline processes for information and data sharing, while encouraging Allies and partners to enhance their information protection posture and cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will also continue to develop active and passive defenses against regional hypersonic missile threats, and pursue a persistent and resilient sensor network to characterize and track all hypersonic threats, improve attribution, and enable engagement. Acquisition strategies for new sensors, interceptors, and C2 systems must be fully aligned — with sensors as the priority. As appropriate, the United States will pursue joint research and development on hypersonic defense programs with key Allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAMD.&lt;/strong&gt; Nested within our broader missile defeat approach, IAMD is the integration of capabilities and overlapping operations to defend the homeland, Allies and partners, protect the Joint and combined forces, and enable freedom of action by negating an adversary’s ability to create adverse effects with air and missile capabilities. IAMD represents an effort to move beyond platform-specific missile defense toward a broader approach melding all missile defeat capabilities — defensive, passive, offensive, kinetic, non-kinetic — into a comprehensive joint and combined construct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing and fielding IAMD systems is a complex problem set. To address the rapidly evolving threat, the acquisition community must continue to exploit adaptive acquisition approaches to ensure the timely and cost-effective development, procurement, sustainment, and improvement of IAMD systems, while providing a clear investment strategy over the near-, medium-, and long-terms. The Department must develop, design, acquire, and maintain Joint IAMD systems that are integrated, interoperable, and sufficiently mobile, flexible, and affordable to protect the homeland and dispersed joint and combined maneuver forces from the full spectrum of air and missile threats. Interoperability breeds efficiency and economy of resources. To enhance this effect in IAMD, the Department must develop and exercise innovative combinations of Service, national, and Allied and partner capabilities to meet mission needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area of importance related to IAMD is the increasing challenge of counter-UAS (C-UAS). UAS are an inexpensive, flexible and plausibly deniable way for adversaries endeavoring to carry out tactical-level attacks below the threshold for major response, making them an increasingly preferred capability for state and non-state actors alike. UAS capabilities are also growing in variety, quality, and quantity. The homeland and regionally forward deployed forces require the fielding of technical and integrated C-UAS solutions with cross-DoD and interagency synchronization to ensure they can meet the range of threats and appropriately hedge against future advancements. Within the homeland, protecting the population from UAS threats is a combined interagency mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Technologies.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States requires responsive, persistent, resilient, and cost- effective joint IAMD sensor capabilities to detect, characterize, track, and engage current and emerging advanced air and missile threats regionally, and to improve early warning, identification, tracking, discrimination, and attribution for missile threats to the homeland. Sensors must be integrated into a cohesive architecture with increasingly capable C2 in order to provide leaders with a maximized decision space for informed actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensors should be able to seamlessly transition from theater-level threats, to homeland defense, to global threats, by sharing and transmitting data with C2 as threats move in and out of the atmosphere. Because of their global nature, persistence, and greater access to denied regions, resilient space-based infrared, radar, and associated data transport systems will be critical to any future integrated sensor network. Likewise, modern over-the-horizon radar capabilities are essential to improving warning and tracking against cruise missile and other threats to the homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced sensor capabilities need to facilitate different mission areas simultaneously. These include strategic and theater missile warning and tracking to: alert national leadership and cue missile defenses in the event of a missile launch; offer space domain awareness to provide indications and warning of threats; support mission assurance of the space architecture; and prompt ISR to provide persistent, and often unwarned, global information essential to the whole of government. Therefore, the ability to operate these sensors through common, joint and combined all-domain integrated and survivable C2 networks and architectures is paramount. The United States will continue to leverage industry, academia, government, and allied and partner solutions to augment existing Department of Defense capabilities and foster rapid future capability employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced and innovative technologies and more effective battle management will be crucial to moving the United States towards a cost-effective and integrated set of offensive and defensive capabilities. To cope with rapidly increasing adversary development of missile-centric Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) threats, the Department must seek new technologies and hedge against continuing adversary missile developments and emerging capabilities such as hypersonic weapons, multiple and maneuvering warheads, and missile defense countermeasures. Future air and missile defense capabilities must also be more mobile, flexible, survivable, and affordable, and emphasize disaggregation, dispersal, and maneuver to mitigate the threat from adversary missiles. Finally, these technologies and platforms — including those enabling NC3 — must be inherently cyber-secure, joined by resilient, redundant and hardened networks, and monitored by an agile defensive cyber force operating under a clear, unified C2 construct.&lt;/p&gt;

It raises awareness of the societal reintegration preparations needed by the countries of origin for the mental, physical, and potentially ideological challenges these foreign volunteers may have faced while responding to the defense of Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, there was an outcry across Europe, the West, and nations globally, questioning the legitimacy of the war. Although there had been Russian occupation of Ukrainian territory and associated conflict since 2014, the invasion sparked a new, distinct phase of interstate conflict with geopolitical considerations and socioeconomic impacts. Initially, there was relatively wide-ranging support of the call from Ukraine for foreign volunteers to join its military efforts based on nations’ perceived alliances to Ukraine, considerations of European security, and concerns over threats from Russia and its interests and allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the initial days of the conflict, however, with official processes to join the International Legion of Defence of Ukraine still not fully in place, there was confusion over the legality of this type of active participation in a foreign conflict. For many, this dynamic resonated with the topical issue of foreign fighters, who traveled to fight with Daesh in Syria and Iraq, and the challenges of how to handle their status and return or perhaps with the less-discussed status of those who traveled to fight against Daesh outside of sanctioned military operations. Thus, it is important to clarify the distinctions among types of individual participation in foreign conflicts under the international legal system set up to govern armed conflict, including categories of foreign terrorist fighters, foreign fighters, foreign volunteers, and mercenaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine worked quickly to establish a process by which foreign volunteers could officially and in a widely and internationally sanctioned manner join the ranks of the International Legion, a division of its national military. Even with this process of volunteering to fight as part of a national military rather than joining paramilitary groups in place, questions remain around the legality of this process and how much process and preparation, which would normally be a part of military engagement, has been put in place to prepare foreign volunteers to fight. Additionally, due to the ideologically charged nature of the invasion, justification narratives from Russia, and the historical context of the conflict, there are concerns of exposure to far-right ideological influence for those traveling to participate. The pre-invasion context from 2014 to 2022 was certainly imbued with ideological threats, with thousands traveling to fight there in support of far-right ideological purposes. Although paramilitary units often encouraged this kind of participation, they largely have now been absorbed into the official military establishment, and the far-right ideological narrative has been discouraged. Nevertheless, there remains a concern that foreign volunteers may be exposed, due to the conflict context itself or through the belief systems of their comrades, to extremist ideologies that they may carry home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief addresses the implications and impacts of the call to fight in Ukraine in order to gauge potential threats and to encourage preparations for the successful return and reintegration of volunteers into civilian life. Reportedly, there have been more than 20,000 volunteers from 52 countries,  but other estimates suggest that the number of those who entered Ukraine with the intention of fighting is closer to 2,000. Therefore, this brief provides an overview of the status of those fighting in the Ukraine conflict because this impacts potential responses, such as tracking, monitoring, and engaging with these individuals. Finally, it raises awareness of the preparations needed by the countries of origin for the mental, physical, and potentially ideological challenges these foreign volunteers may have faced while responding to the call to defend Ukraine to ensure their successful societal reintegration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because these private citizens are traveling to fight in an armed conflict outside of their domestic military services, they could be left without a range of support that would be available to them as domestic military veterans. Without these services in place, they face potential challenges with a civilian system largely ill-equipped to understand or address their needs. The counterterrorism community has focused on disengagement, deradicalization, rehabilitation, and reintegration of those classed as foreign terrorist fighters. Yet, there is seemingly little preparation in place at the national government level for assessment and provision of similar services, where needed, for foreign volunteers returning from the conflict. Especially due to the emergency nature of this call, processes of predeployment training, mental and physical well-being monitoring, or event postdeployment support for those who have been involved in combat are unclear. It is therefore essential that countries with citizens who have volunteered to participate in this conflict are preparing for their return and providing services to them in support of their mental and physical well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;definitions-of-participation&quot;&gt;DEFINITIONS OF PARTICIPATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the current counterterrorism policy focus on the return of foreign fighters, in relation to returning those who traveled to fight with Daesh in Syria and Iraq, it becomes important to clarify the distinctions among foreign terrorist fighters, foreign fighters, foreign volunteers, and mercenaries under the international legal system set up to govern armed conflict. In order to be prosecuted as a foreign terrorist fighter, which is a legal classification established in response to the large number of individuals traveling to fight with Daesh, an individual must be fighting on behalf of a proscribed terrorist organization. In the international framework, this classification was established by UN Security Council Resolution 2178 in 2014. It remains controversial, however, with many still opting to retain use of foreign fighter versus foreign terrorist fighter because it binds member states to criminalize a wide range of activities related to foreign fighting and blurs the distinction between terrorism and participation in armed conflict that may be legal under international humanitarian law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who traveled prior to the establishment of a defined pathway for volunteering for Ukraine’s International Division qualify for penalization as foreign fighters, which is often subject to national legal interpretation and influenced by political appetite. The individuals who joined as foreign volunteers with the International Legion under national constitutions that allow citizens to fight in foreign militaries have entered the conflict legally and would not be subject to prosecution for participation within the boundaries of international humanitarian law. Regardless of the legality under international humanitarian law, however, foreign military volunteering remains illegal under the national constitutions of some countries. Mercenaries are those who are contracted to fight in a foreign country for pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concern this raises with regard to individuals who traveled prior to the official pathway to volunteer is that those who fought with paramilitary groups prior to February 2022 have been prosecuted in some cases for crimes as foreign fighters and linked to far-right ideological threats of violent extremism. Some countries (e.g., the Czech Republic, Germany, the United Kingdom) have acted to criminalize participation in the 2014–2022 conflict. Yet, some countries, often those with less political will or well-defined far-right–focused laws, chose to largely ignore this participation. For example, as application of U.S. counterterrorism law was dependent on the legal definition of the group they were joining as a foreign terrorist organization, thousands of Americans traveled to fight with ideologically far-right paramilitary groups between 2014 and 2022 and often were not prosecuted or provided with services or deradicalization programming after their return. This was seen by some counterterrorism professionals as a fault in the counterterrorism framework’s design, with its myopic focus on Islamist violent extremism and in stark contrast to those prosecuted as foreign terrorist fighters due to the designation of organizations such as Daesh and al-Qaida as foreign terrorist organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With it being legal under international humanitarian law to become a foreign volunteer and with relatively open and easy travel to the conflict zone, tracking those who have gone to fight might be difficult, especially if they traveled prior to the formation of the formal process. Travel outside the formal process of volunteering for the International Legion raises the legal question of foreign fighter status rather than foreign volunteer status, which adds the difficulty of whether to prosecute these individuals. Also, even for those who volunteered through the official avenue, there will inevitably arise situations of illegal battlefield conduct in violation of international humanitarian law, which will present complex legal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-the-appeal&quot;&gt;IMPLICATIONS OF THE APPEAL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it would be incorrect to assume that everyone who traveled to fight from 2014 to 2022 did so for far-right ideological reasons or that everyone who has traveled to fight after February 2022 would come into contact with these ideological influences, it is important to acknowledge that far-right influences present in Ukraine have not disappeared. For example, the Azov Battalion, which formed in 2014 and was later integrated into the Ukrainian National Guard, and the Azov Movement, a far-right nationalist network of military, paramilitary, and political organizations that grew out of the Azov Battalion, have extensive ties to the transnational far-right ecosystem. Also, the narratives surrounding the initial Russian invasion were highly ideological. Although these narratives were largely wielded as a political tool, there have been or are far-right ideological motivations on both sides of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been discussed in research on extremism within the security forces, there is a potential vulnerability created in environments of extreme in-group/outgroup formation, such as in the case of the military unit bonding experience. Research has shown this can especially be true in combat-focused units, often elite military units subject to intensive unit building, with a dehumanization of the enemy out-group potentially encouraging ideologies of superiority (e.g., white supremacism, ultranationalism, misogyny). The combination of these “othering” narratives, individual expectation, and the physical and mental toll of combat environments could potentially increase the appeal of far-right ideologies and decrease resilience to radicalization or recruitment. Additionally, the combat and weapons skills obtained by these individuals make them a high-value target for those trying to recruit individuals into violent extremist groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to this, it is important to note the highly gendered narrative of the conflict and of the appeal for volunteers. The rhetoric of this conflict, although varied, in the case of appealing to foreign volunteers often focused on a sense of hypermasculine patriotism, with a call for men with combat experience to take up arms in defense of those who could not defend themselves (e.g., pregnant women being bombed). Largely due to the perception of military service being a masculine space, the call clearly was aimed to appeal to the gendered essentialisms that able-bodied men should protect women and children and that it is their duty to fight and die to defend the oppressed. This creates an environment in which the hypermasculine definition of patriotism becomes an impossible bar for performance. Expectations such as this and the mental pressures that they place on an individual can result in a spectrum of dangers—at one end, hypermasculine conceptions of patriotism that radicalize individuals to misogyny, ultranationalism, and xenophobia and, at the other end, feelings of inadequacy and failure that can fuel radicalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of the call to arms are significant in the aftermath of a conflict and to an individual fighter’s pathway to postcombat rehabilitation and reintegration into civilian life. The realities of combat environments, whether an experienced professional or not, are unpredictable and often different from the expected experience. Many different elements can make the point of separation from a militarized identity and the transition to civilian life a point of concern. Sometimes, such a strong identity is formed with the military/unit group that it becomes difficult to regain individual identity; sometimes, traumas experienced during conflict leave lasting physical and mental (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder) scars; and sometimes, failed expectations of heroism or of lack of a resolution to the conflict can damage individual identity. Additionally, in some cases, these concerns will be compounded by the fact that some of those who traveled were veterans who were already struggling to form a civilian identity and seized on the opportunity to participate again in the military environment. This could potentially compound existing challenges if they do not feel adequately satisfied by their participation or if there is an undesired or unresolved end to the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impacts-of-combat-and-necessary-support-systems&quot;&gt;IMPACTS OF COMBAT AND NECESSARY SUPPORT SYSTEMS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining the military in times of crisis or conflict impacts the environment, tempo, and conditions into which individuals enter, even in the case of individuals joining their own standing national militaries, demanding that service members integrate, adapt, and prepare quickly. These effects would be amplified exponentially when a volunteer joins an international division of a foreign military during an active conflict. In most cases, the support systems in place as part of national military training, welfare, and so on would be much more comprehensive than what the foreign volunteers received, and it is essential to be aware of the impacts of the environment in which they enlisted after their return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the military, there is normally a “boot camp” environment at the entry point in which unit formation is emphasized. This may exist in a limited fashion for the foreign volunteers, but it would presumably be a truncated experience due to the pressing nature of the conflict dynamics. This could have implications in relation to the dangers presented earlier. Additionally, in the military there is often a focus on predeployment training and preparation or, in some cases, mission training and preparation. These systems are in place to ensure a clear understanding of purpose; a time for mental preparation, if possible, for what is to come; and an understanding of roles and responsibilities within the unit, among other things. For a quickly deployed international division, it is likely that these systems were limited and often challenged by the different backgrounds, languages, ranks, and expectations represented by the influx of volunteers from numerous countries and from various backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would likely be a stark contrast between those volunteering with previous military service and those who might have come from backgrounds with less, little, or no organized combatant training. Organized militaries are required to train their service members on international humanitarian law and the codes that govern interstate conflict and armed combat, but not all the volunteers may have received that training. This type of training often also focuses on preparation for the traumatic nature of combat, including preparation of individuals mentally and physically for responding to torture or being captured or held as prisoners of war. Without this, the volunteer’s experience might be exponentially more traumatic, they could endanger themselves or their unit, or they could engage in war crimes or illegal battlefield conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is a question of the volunteers returning to their civilian lives without a postdeployment debrief and physical and mental health check and without clear access to support services of which they might be in need. Most militaries have put these systems in place, either through military systems for those remaining on active duty or through veteran’s programs for those leaving service. To varying degrees, these programs monitor the physical and mental well-being of these individuals and help them to process the impacts of combat. Also, even though these efforts are often much less substantial than they should be, there is the onus on these systems to assess service members as potential security threats, in cases in which radicalization or recruitment may be happening or they may commit acts of violence, such as domestic violence or self-harm. The military jurisdiction over these support systems is often separated from civilian social care services and is especially equipped for the needs of those who have participated in combat. So, if foreign volunteers are returning to their home countries but do not qualify for support systems associated with domestic military service, there is a clear danger that they might go unmonitored or not be able to access through civilian pathways the type of services that would be best acclimated to meet their needs and understand their risks and vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the implications and impacts of the call to fight in Ukraine, it becomes apparent how important it is to ensure that there is preparation at the national level for the return of citizens who have traveled to participate. Some lessons on monitoring, rehabilitation, and reintegration concerns and programming can be taken from the adjacent contexts of services that militaries provide after combat or to veterans or in some cases services that counterterrorism or civil society organizations are preparing or implementing for returning foreign fighters. Yet, many different dynamics to this interstate conflict must be fully considered to ensure that the law has been upheld and that the transition of these individuals back to civilian life does not present a danger to themselves or to society. There should be preparations made now, presumably to address some individuals who have already returned and to have support systems in place for others who are yet to return from Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, transition points between military and civilian life can be especially vulnerable. No matter the experience of individuals, there will undoubtedly be physical and mental implications of participation in an active combat zone; left unsupported, these can quickly present challenges that turn into security threats to the individuals, their families and friends, or even to society in cases of radicalization. There are often service systems in place with established national militaries that would normally oversee the pre- and post-deployment needs of those participating in combat. In the case of the pressing needs of Ukraine and the hasty establishment of their volunteer International Legion in the conflict, however, responsibility for these types of services will likely fall largely on the national governments of the countries to which these volunteers might return. Therefore, awareness of potential concerns must be raised, including devising who can best offer the most effective and appropriate services, so that preparations can be made to support these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wherever possible, the traveler and legal status of participants in the conflict should be established. Policy and necessary resources should be in place to track their return so that there is a clear process for relevant security, health, legal, and other actors and a point of contact for the individuals after their return.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consideration should be given by national authorities to who would be the relevant and responsible authorities in the case of these individuals, especially for those who have traveled legally as foreign volunteers, and how much oversight there can be of their postdeployment debrief or assessment in coordination with offering of services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those who did not travel legally, either based on their national laws or their traveling prior to the establishment of the official process for foreign volunteering, or for those who may have committed battlefield crimes, agreements should be established by which it will be the national responsibility to investigate and prosecute or where this would fall under the remit of an international tribunal. Some lessons could be taken from evidencegathering techniques applied in other contexts (e.g., the prosecution of foreign fighters).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communications policy should be put in place to govern the public governmental response to the participation of individuals from their country, whether this participation is considered to reflect positively or negatively, and to moderate any public response. This is to ensure coordination but also the well-being and safety of the individuals returning (e.g., to ensure coordinated governmental voice and lack of dynamic politization on support for volunteering or support for rehabilitation and reintegration of these individuals or to avoid negative or harmful stigmatization of returning fighters in countries where public opinion might be less supportive or divided).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jurisdiction of relevant physical and mental health and other support services should be considered because often the types of services that would be best equipped and knowledgeable about the needs of these individuals would be under the military or veteran services rather than civilian services. If these individuals are to be connected with civilian service providers, sufficient training should be given to these providers on the impacts and implications of participation in active combat zones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Awareness should be raised among policymakers, security actors, and service providers on the context of the far-right ideological dynamics espoused as part of the narrative of this interstate conflict to avoid stigmatization of those who have volunteered to fight and to help anticipate any potential threats of fighters returning radicalized or with links to transnational far-right networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

How effective have the Taliban’s efforts been and whether has IS-K been able to adapt?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It assesses the performance of the Taliban in one case study of counterterrorism (IS-K activities in the campuses) and the adaptation of IS-K in response. It is based on a series of 25 interviews with IS-K militants, Taliban security and intelligence officials, and university staff and students, carried out after the regime change in Kabul in August 2021. In order to set out the operating environment of Taliban counterterrorism, the paper also describes in detail, with new evidence, the sophisticated IS-K approach to recruitment on Afghanistan’s university campuses, combining face-to-face and remote techniques. IS-K’s recruitment is aimed at a relatively small niche, largely Salafi and Salafi-leaning students, and can yield only a limited number of recruits, certainly not exceeding the low hundreds annually. Nonetheless, these are high-quality recruits, on which the highly ideological and disciplined IS-K must rely to sustain its operations. Indeed, the Taliban seem to have paid considerable attention to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By denying the space they once had on the campuses to IS-K activists, the Taliban have constrained IS-K’s ability to recruit, but this could well be only temporary, especially as IS-K adapts and refines its recruitment techniques, relying more on private social media channels, moving more of its social media activists abroad, and warning its members and sympathisers about the risk of Taliban infiltrators and provocateurs. Moreover, the underlying conditions favouring IS-K recruitment persist, including serious harassment of Salafi students by some of their Hanafi colleagues; heavy-handed treatment of suspects by Taliban police and intelligence; widespread student frustration at their conditions and lack of prospects; and Taliban pressure on non-violent extremist groups that have roots among students, such as Hizb ut-Tahrir, Jami’at Eslah and others, which might drive some of their members towards IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s approach to counterterrorism on university campuses has, in other words, been focused on repression, with seemingly little, if any, effort towards prevention. The ability of the Taliban to reduce IS-K activities using heavy-handed measures runs the risk of delivering both short-term positive results and long-term counterproductive ones, not least because the Taliban struggle to restrain the behaviour of their sympathisers and indeed anyone holding anti-Salafi views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The branch of the Islamic State for Central and South Asia, which calls itself Islamic State in Khorasan (IS-K) and is also known as the Caliphate’s Wilayat (Province) Khorasan, might have been eclipsed from UK media, but it remains a major terrorism concern in South and Central Asia, because of its highprofile attacks, mostly involving the ruthless slaughter of civilians. Over the years, IS-K has taken heavy casualties from both the Taliban and the US, but has been able to (at least in part) regenerate its force, drawing from limited but rather loyal constituencies both inside and outside Afghanistan. The role of the group’s once dominant Pakistani component has been reduced by the establishment of Wilayat Pakistan, a new ‘province’ of the Islamic State that effectively competes with the Caliphate’s original branch, Wilayat Khorasan, for funding and recruits. Another development that reduced the number of IS-K’s Pakistani recruits present in Afghanistan was the leadership’s decision to transfer of hundreds of them to the former tribal areas of Pakistan, where they have been increasingly active against the Pakistani security forces. As a result, the group’s sources of recruits inside Afghanistan have become more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two main such sources have so far been the Salafi community and university students (there is some overlap between the two). The Islamic State is today essentially a Salafi organisation, so it is not surprising that it primarily attracts Salafis in Afghanistan too, the more so as there has been friction for years between Salafis and Hanafis, especially Deobandis like the dominant faction of the Taliban, and Sufis, who are also well represented among the Taliban. Until the 1970s, virtually all Afghanistan’s Sunnis had been Hanafis. The arrival of strictly ‘fundamentalist’ Salafi missionaries from Pakistan gradually led to the conversion of much of the population of eastern and northeastern Afghanistan. Among the Hanafi, traditionalist currents such as Sufism and less strict ‘fundamentalist’ tendencies such as Deobandism were especially antagonised. This paper examines the hitherto understudied IS-K presence in Afghanistan’s university campuses and the counterterrorism effort that the Taliban regime has mounted against it, asking how effective the Taliban’s efforts have been and whether IS-K has been able to adapt. The focus is on the Taliban’s counterterrorism, as opposed to the wider Taliban counterinsurgency effort, because the tools the Taliban deployed against IS-K in the campuses have been typical counterterrorism ones: policing rather than fighting, with infiltration and intelligence gathering being prominent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s counterterrorism efforts focused on IS-K after their return to power in August 2021 are a rather unexplored field. There is little evidence that the Taliban’s approach to counterterrorism has drawn on Western understandings, even if there is some superficial overlap in tactics. Counterterrorism tactics shared by the Taliban and Western authorities include intelligence-driven raids, infiltration of extremist groups and manipulation of media reporting, among other things. Nevertheless, as the Taliban’s Emirate (the Taliban’s de facto government, established in August 2021) does rely on a number of advisers who served in the previous government, some indirect influence cannot be ruled out. The lack of desire to take inspiration from Western counterterrorism is unsurprising, given that the Taliban were the target of Western counterterrorism efforts for almost 20 years, and that those efforts are seen by the Taliban as having failed to keep them out of power. Since the first Taliban Emirate (1996–2001) did not experience a terrorist threat (although it did face insurgencies), and the challenge posed by IS-K to the Taliban in 2015–21 was of a different nature – clashes between the two groups’ armed units – the second Emirate’s counterterrorism effort had to start with a blank slate when IS-K resumed terrorist attacks a couple of weeks after the Taliban had taken power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the character and effectiveness of Taliban counterterrorism is important in determining both the fate of the Emirate and state resilience in Afghanistan in the near term. Another reason for examining this area is to assess the impact and effectiveness of an approach to counterterrorism that, if not necessarily consciously designed as an alternative to Western doctrine, is certainly not directly shaped to conform with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is part of a wider effort to gather data on and analyse the Taliban’s counterterrorism and counterinsurgency efforts, and it does not presume to offer a final and complete analysis of the subject. The intent is to contribute data and emerging thoughts on a regime that had no incentive to adopt Western counterterrorism doctrine or practice (or that of any other power). Instead, the Taliban have had to find their own way in dealing with a terrorist threat. Why is their experience relevant to anybody interested in counterterrorism? Concern remains, in the region and beyond, about the existence of a local branch of the Islamic State. Further, non-Western practice in counterterrorism is an emergent field of study and this paper aims to contribute to it. Afghanistan under the Taliban can be taken as an exemplary case study of a regime confronting terrorism (and specifically IS) while lacking any external backing (financial or otherwise), having little resources of its own, and suffering from a lack of specific skills and knowhow. This will be a not-so-rare state of affairs in the future, and studying emerging counterterrorism practices is bound to yield useful insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this paper does not discuss Taliban counterterrorism doctrine, which may well not even exist, but rather their practice as it has been emerging. Indeed, the Taliban appear to be moving tentatively through a trial-and-error process, often driven by provincial-level officials, with limited intervention from the centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines IS-K’s campaign in the campuses and how the Taliban have been responding to it, and offers an assessment of the impact of the two campaigns (terror and counterterror). Given that the Taliban’s counterterrorism campaign is still underway, any findings of this paper can be only partial and preliminary. There are also obvious limitations to the research methodology adopted, with research by necessity limited to oral sources, with limited support from news reports and no access to primary written sources, assuming there are any. It is not clear to what extent the Taliban have a formal decision-making process in counterterrorism, and they cannot be expected to share any documents that they might have seized from their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper seeks to sketch developments in one particular (but important) aspect of Taliban counterterrorism, a new art with which they have been busy since taking power. Researching this topic required a number of methodological compromises, as reaching out to sources in the context of Afghanistan under the Taliban is extremely difficult. IS-K recruiters and members were, of course, the most difficult ones to speak to. As a result, the body of data collected is inevitably incomplete; gaps abound and following up on specific themes was often not possible. The analysis contained in the paper inevitably reflects this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is primarily based on 20 interviews with students, university staff and Taliban security officers, all carried out in October and November 2022, as well as three interviews with IS-K militants, carried out in June 2022, and two interviews with Taliban intelligence officers, carried out in November 2021. The interviews were conducted by three researchers who did not know each other, in order to avoid the risk of collusion in manipulation of the content of the interviews. The interviewees were told that their answers would be used in a publication, the type of which was not specified. All the interviews have been anonymised and all data that could lead to the identification of interviewees has been removed. The risk that respondents could use the interviews to influence or misrepresent the facts was assumed from the start as a precautionary measure. This risk was mitigated by using different types of sources, representing contrasting points of views, by interviewing individuals separately and without them being aware of other interviews taking place, and by inserting questions where the answer was already known. Public-domain sources have also been used, where available, to check the credibility of interviewees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is organised into five sections. The first briefly discusses what is known about IS-K activities on university campuses before regime change in 2021. The next section discusses IS-K activities after regime change, up to autumn 2022, when research for this paper was completed. The third section is dedicated to Taliban counterterrorism efforts on campuses, and is followed by a fourth section, on how IS-K adapted to the Taliban’s repression, and the prospects of IS-K overcoming the obstacles placed by the Taliban in its path on Afghanistan’s university campuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-k-activities-on-university-campuses-before-15-august-2021&quot;&gt;IS-K ACTIVITIES ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES BEFORE 15 AUGUST 2021&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recruitment of Afghan university students by IS-K was an established fact before the fall of Kabul to the Taliban in August 2021. In 2015, at least two students were reported to have volunteered to fight in Syria with IS. One was a computer science student, allegedly radicalised while attending an Islamic culture course at Kabul University. Then, in 2018, some students in the economics department were detained by the security services of the previous regime. In 2019, the National Directorate of Security detained three lecturers from the Sharia faculty and two former students on charges of recruiting for IS-K. The confession of one of the former students appears to show that the lecturers first tried to attract students towards Salafism, and only once that was achieved would they try to recruit them into IS-K. IS-K has long been attracting recruits from Kabul University’s Sharia faculty. Recruitment has been facilitated by the poor quality of university education in Afghanistan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ramin Kamangar, a researcher based in Kabul, said that historically many extremist groups had deep roots in Afghan society. The academic curriculum was designed in such a way that every group could manipulate academic textbooks, including Sharia law textbooks, which are mandatory courses for every faculty across the country. ‘The textbooks of Islamic law are not academic,’ Kamangar said. ‘They present that Islam is the best religion and speak in the form of ideological black and white.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous regime did not clamp down heavily on pro IS-K clerics (ulema) and teachers, for fear of a backlash from the wider Salafi ulema community, whom it considered useful allies against the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already in 2020, researcher Borhan Osman found that Kabul University, Nangarhar University and Al-Biruni University (a private university) were major sources of IS-K recruits. The leader of the original IS-K Kabul cell was in fact a graduate of Al-Biruni University, located in Gulbahar, a town split between the provinces of Parwan and Kapisa. The dormitories of state universities were a hotbed of IS-K activity, to the extent that the authorities restricted their availability to students. A staff member at Kabul University confirms that under the previous regime (2001–21), recruitment by violent extremist groups was widespread in Kabul’s dormitories. Osman also learned that IS-K in Kabul recruits largely among Tajiks, usually from old strongholds of Jami’at Islami, originally a moderate Muslim Brotherhood organisation that ‘romanticised jihad’ in the 1980s and then exposed itself to IS-K criticism for failing to implement an Islamic regime in the 1990s. Typically, recruits went through Salafi activism first, and/or joined non-violent groups such as the pan-Islamist Hizb ut-Tahrir (HuT) and militant student organisation Jami’at Eslah. A group of female Salafi–jihadist activists sympathetic to IS-K was also identified at a private university in Kabul in this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-k-activities-on-afghanistans-campuses-after-the-taliban-takeover&quot;&gt;IS-K ACTIVITIES ON AFGHANISTAN’S CAMPUSES AFTER THE TALIBAN TAKEOVER&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the Taliban took power, tension between Salafi and Hanafi students was running high on campuses, and physical fights were not uncommon. Since the change of regime, the Taliban have been restricting Salafi activities, and Hanafi students have felt encouraged to become more assertive, with some harassing Salafis, and Salafi students mostly forced to keep a low profile and avoid responding. A few Salafi students have continued to quarrel with Hanafis and have attracted the attention of IS-K, which is particularly interested in individuals with a militant Salafi profile. There are also reported still to be several university staff members and students who are active Salafi preachers and proselytisers. Sympathy for non-violent extremist groups, especially HuT and Jami’at Eslah, was widespread among university students as the Islamic Republic was unwinding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-importance-of-students-to-is-k&quot;&gt;THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDENTS TO IS-K&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K sources have been proudly acknowledging their efforts to recruit university students. In the words of a commander:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These university students, whom we call ‘consciousness’ members, are very good in the recruitment of fighters and members through social media because they know Islam very well and are very good at convincing people to join jihad in Afghanistan. We have been very good in recruitment of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is noteworthy as a statement about the value of educated members to IS-K. Another commander relayed a common IS-K motto: ‘One consciousness fighter or commander is much better than 100 uneducated fighters’. These highly ideological members are considered the backbone of IS-K, because they are very good at encouraging other members to ‘fight for Islam against non-believers and against those who are misusing the name of jihad and Islam for power, like the Taliban’. Interviews showed that the recruitment focus remains on the Sharia faculty, but students coming from other faculties would be approached if they showed strong religious interests, even if they were not Salafis already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A source from the Taliban’s intelligence agency, the GDI, confirmed in November 2021 that IS-K was focusing much of its recruitment effort on Kabul University, in particular the Sharia department, where many had been recruited in previous years. At that time, Kabul University was closed, but intelligence sources were reporting that IS-K was already ordering its teams to resume recruitment activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;is-k-assets-on-campuses&quot;&gt;IS-K ASSETS ON CAMPUSES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan’s higher education sector includes both public (39 as of 2020) and private (up to 145) universities, with 400,000 students in 2020, about one-third of whom study at private colleges. Numbers are believed to have fallen after the Taliban takeover, even before women’s access to higher education was suspended in December 2022. While public universities are free, admission exams represent an obstacle for many who would like to get a degree. Private universities, by contrast, are only accessible to wealthy families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GDI believed in late 2021 that there were IS-K cells in Kabul University and also some teachers linked to IS-K. They believed that IS-K was also active in some private universities in Kabul, and viewed blocking IS-K recruitment as a top priority. Another GDI source stated that they had identified three IS-K networks active in Kabul University and in Al-Biruni University. At that time, only the private universities were open, and the GDI was focusing its monitoring efforts on these. The Kabul University networks were allegedly led by Sharia faculty teachers and supported by networks active on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-2022, sources confirmed IS-K being active in Kabul and Gulbahar but added that Nangarhar University and Badakhshan University were the other recruitment hotspots. It is worth noting the considerable overlap of the findings of this research with Osman’s findings, reported above, and the addition of Badakhshan University. An IS-K recruiter confirmed in November 2022 that IS-K still had many sympathisers in Nangarhar University, even if they needed to lie low to avoid detection. Indeed, at that point IS-K still considered Nangahar to be its main student recruitment ground. According to this source, there were several cells of IS-K recruiters active in the university, each with three members. Considering their respective sizes, Kabul University (with almost three times as many registered students as Nangarhar) appears to have been less affected: the six IS-K cells reportedly operating on the Kabul University campus, with two to three members each, were mostly active within the Sharia department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there might be variations between locations, the IS-K structure on the campuses seems to be organised into the following dedicated sections: ‘targeting’, ‘media and culture’, ‘chatting and inviting’, and ‘face-to-face communication’. The ‘targeting’ section is the largest, in terms of staffing. Most of the cells operate within the Sharia and law faculties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;is-k-recruitment-techniques&quot;&gt;IS-K RECRUITMENT TECHNIQUES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Targeting’, as discussed by IS-K sources, is essentially an intelligence activity, aimed at identifying potential recruits. The targeter’s job is described as being ‘to single out and target the most religious students, who have the greatest interest in religious issues and especially Salafism’. Within this category, the targeters prioritise those known to have suffered at the hands of what a source called ‘extremist Hanafi students’, or whose family members were caught up in the Taliban’s repression of IS activity. Typically, in a class of 40 to 50 students, there will be one to two worth targeting. Once a targeted student is identified, the targeting structure tries to get their mobile number. Then, the ‘media and culture’ section takes over. The job of the media and culture team, who are based outside the university, even as far away as Europe, is to send to prospective recruits videos of ‘cruelties, killing, torturing and arresting of Salafi scholars, common Salafis, women and children by Taliban’, messages about Salafism, and videos and news about the Taliban negotiating with the Americans. Before the regime change of 2021, the propaganda material had been about ‘foreigners bombing Muslims’ and the ‘torturing and arresting of Muslim men, women and children by Americans’. If there is a negative reaction, the ‘invitee’ is immediately cut off from messaging. If the response is positive, WhatsApp and other social media apps start to be used. The media and culture team also adds targeted students to various IS-K Telegram accounts, some of which advertise the activities of IS-K, while others propagate negative propaganda against the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stage, after the ground has been prepared by exposure to ‘media and culture’ work, sees the ‘chatting and inviting’ team take over, opening a one-on-one chat room on Telegram or WhatsApp and tasking its cadres to befriend specific individuals. These one-on-one chats focus on the situation of Salafis in Afghanistan, on the ‘cruelties’ of the Taliban against Salafis, on harassment suffered at the hands of Hanafi students and Taliban on campus, on the ‘jihad’ and the activities and aims of IS-K, and on IS’s ‘Caliphate’, as well as many other issues. During this phase, the recruiter regularly visits the target both on the university campus and outside it, to learn more about their mindset and views, build up trust and develop a friendship. Prospective recruits are directly fed or directed towards hundreds of speeches and lectures by well-known Salafi preachers, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sheikh Abu Obaidullah Mutawakil, a member of the Sharia faculty at Kabul University, who was detained under the Islamic Republic for acting as an IS-K recruiter, and abducted and assassinated after the Taliban takeover, in September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mubashir Muslimyar, also a member of the Sharia faculty at Kabul, assassinated in Kabul in February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marouf Rasikh, a third member of the Sharia faculty at Kabul, who was detained and released under the Islamic Republic, only to be assassinated in February 2021 in Kabul.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abdul Zahir Da’ee, another member of the Sharia faculty, Kabul, and the only one of this group still alive and active. He was detained under the Islamic Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the targeted student is familiar with such preachers’ thinking, they are invited by the recruiter to convert to Salafism or, if already Salafi, to adopt a stricter attitude. If this works out well, the target is invited to join openly pro-IS-K private chats on Telegram. Some recruits are ready at this stage to volunteer for IS-K, while others might need more work. In the latter case, targets’ reactions to the private IS-K channels are observed over a period of several days. If the reaction is positive, the targeted individual is invited to join the jihad against the Taliban and anyone else who is opposed to Salafism and the Caliphate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before being invited to join IS-K, prospective recruits are invited to embrace Salafism or, if they are already Salafis, to start practising it more strictly. After a while, the targeted students are invited to join the jihad against the Taliban and anybody who is against Salafism and the Caliphate. If the invitation is accepted, the invitee is offered a face-to-face meeting. This is when the ‘faceto-face’ team takes over. Soon afterwards, this team offers training to the prospective recruit in one of the IS-K camps in preparation for fully joining as a member. The entire process typically takes up to three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of those who reach the stage of being fed IS-K propaganda agree to join, although not all. Because up to this point potential recruits have only been contacted via social media, they present only a limited risk to IS-K: all they can do is alert the authorities that something is going on, but they cannot compromise any individuals. Most university recruits are not interested in becoming fighters, even if they do join. For this reason, they are often offered roles such as being a support element in a terrorist cell, social media activist, preacher/indoctrinator, working in logistics, or looking after safe houses, among other things. Some do become terrorist cell leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taliban-counterterrorism&quot;&gt;TALIBAN COUNTERTERRORISM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;practice-diverges-from-policy-and-principles&quot;&gt;PRACTICE DIVERGES FROM POLICY AND PRINCIPLES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public universities closed immediately after the Taliban took Kabul in August 2021. The Taliban declared that they wanted to determine how to gender-segregate campuses before reopening them. Simultaneously, the Taliban restricted discourse on politics, human rights and Islam. When the universities reopened in February 2022, the Taliban knew they were going to face trouble on the campuses, because as a movement they always had little appeal among university students and were perceived as hostile to secular education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their approach to the IS-K presence on university campuses should be viewed within the context of the Emirate’s wider approach to counterterrorism. The Taliban do not appear to have formulated any specific or explicit counterterrorism policy. The previous government, the Islamic Republic, did formulate policies, but it did not implement them systematically. Those policies were based on ‘Western’ counterterrorism concepts, of which respect for the rule of law and human rights were, in theory, essential elements – notwithstanding the fact that, in practice, Afghan security forces and Western actors might often disregard such elements. Indeed, the security forces of the Islamic Republic by and large maintained a high degree of scepticism about these policies. The following summary of their critique derives from a series of interviews with Afghan enforcement officials, carried out in 2015–21, during the years of the Islamic Republic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rule of law slows the counterterror effort and wastes precious time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rule of law, with the high standards of evidence required, makes it difficult to convict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terror emergencies, qualified relevant personnel, such as adequately trained police officers, are scarce and it is very hard to gather sufficient evidence for a conviction, the more so in Afghanistan, where qualified personnel were scarce even before the insurgency began.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Torture and physical pressure deliver quick results during interrogation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Highly motivated terrorists are not going to be deterred by the threat of ordinary custodial sentences and are unlikely to be convinced to collaborate without extreme forms of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Media freedom is not useful when tackling terrorism, as it advertises the achievements of the terrorists while embarrassing the authorities with the exposure of their failures and/or ruthless methods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Civilian supporters are a key asset of insurgents and terrorists and must be targeted aggressively as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed below, the Taliban, while not deliberately intending to imitate the former regime’s critics of Western counterterrorism, in many cases shared these attitudes to varying degrees and incorporated them (either individually or as an organisation) into their own practice once they rose to power, despite their commitment to operate under the Sharia and therefore under a type of rule of law. The adoption of counterterrorism practices based on the above assumptions could be a consequence of having been on the receiving end of such practices, of a shared cultural understanding of what effective counterterrorism should be or of any number of other reasons. Determining the cultural and political sources of the Taliban’s approach to counterterrorism is beyond the scope of this paper. What is important to note here is the presence of specific attitudes, operating at either individual or organisational levels, that – as in the time of the Islamic Republic – influenced the counterterrorism effort of the Taliban’s Emirate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning the rule of law (points 1, 2 and 3 above), while the Taliban are in principle committed to introducing their own version of the rule of law, based on Sharia, they have often been wary of applying the protection afforded by the religious texts to rebels, especially IS-K ones. Whether as a result of a deliberate policy or uncontrolled rhetoric freely flourishing in Talibancontrolled media, the term ‘Kharijites’ (khawarij), implying an extreme and even heretical approach, has been in regular use when referring to IS-K. This disparaging term has often been used by governments of countries affected by Islamist insurgencies to justify reliance on extreme measures against seditious elements, who are essentially treated as apostates and therefore worthy of indiscriminate repression. Certainly, the use of such a term can only encourage Taliban practitioners of counterterrorism to bypass whatever Sharia-based rule-of-law constraints may be there in principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban have, in fact, been inconsistent in the way they deal with IS-K militants, sometimes treating them and suspected supporters as ‘Kharijites’ and sometimes using more standard sanctions against them, even on some occasions attempting to use negotiations and political agreements to draw community elders away from IS-K and undermine it. As far as university campuses go, the treatment of Mutawakil is a good example of arbitrary treatment: as noted above, he was first abducted and then arbitrarily executed, reportedly by the Taliban, in September 2021. The Taliban denied responsibility but were widely seen as responsible by the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of torture and physical pressure by the Taliban (points 4 and 5 above) have been noted in a number of reports from international organisations. It was also confirmed as an issue in interviews for this research. An IS-K member noted that he joined following a direct clash with one of his teachers, who was strongly hostile to his Salafist views. He was then detained by the Taliban for two days and tortured and threatened. He was released after promising to change his ideology and then suffered harassment by Hanafi students. When IS-K approached him, he was ripe for recruitment and became an IS-K recruiter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of the Taliban adopting an inconsistent approach is their handling of media reporting (point 6 above). Despite verbally committing to ‘media freedom’ from the start of its second Emirate, the Taliban have been sporadically banning reporting of violent incidents and counterterrorism activities in the belief that it would play into the hands of IS-K if its actions (and the subsequent repressive measures) received media exposure. This also applied to reporting detentions of suspects on the campuses. The Taliban have not been keen to advertise the extent of their repression there. A dozen students and staff on different campuses (out of 15 who were contacted) had the feeling that the Taliban were withholding information regarding arrests of students or staff. At other times, however, the Taliban have used their media apparatus to describe IS-K as ‘Kharijites’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to point 7 above – and again seemingly in breach of Sharia – is the Taliban’s approach towards radical groups that in the West might be described as ‘non-violent extremists’ and that the Taliban describe as ‘Salafileaning’ or ‘pro-Caliphate’. Groups such as HuT, Jami’at Eslah and Najm were banned early on by the Taliban and some alleged HuT members were even detained. Although these groups do not support IS-K or IS Central, the Taliban appear concerned that HuT, for example, advocates the advent of the Caliphate worldwide, and is an international organisation. In the words of a member of the GDI: ‘They advocate the Caliphate in the entire world but we want Sharia only for Afghanistan and we don’t want to interfere in the internal issues of other countries’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That the Taliban’s jihad is a national one is now a key claim of the Emirate’s foreign policy effort, although the Taliban continue to host foreign jihadist groups such as the Pakistani TTP (Tehrik Taliban Pakistan, or Movement of the Pakistani Taliban), Al-Qa’ida and others. Jami’at Eslah has also been viewed with suspicion because of its Salafi influences, which make its ideology ‘closer to Daesh’ (or IS-K). Especially in Badakhshan University (Faizabad), there is a belief that HuT – reportedly quite popular there – facilitates, directly or indirectly, recruitment into IS-K. However, one student at the private Al-Biruni University (in Gulbahar) noted that HuT continued to operate freely there, despite Taliban control, and that the group did not hide its online recruitment activities. He also noted that online activism by HuT was undertaken secretly before the Taliban takeover, but then began to be conducted more openly. A Taliban security source disputed this, saying that HuT and Jami’at Eslah had been active at Al-Biruni, but that neither was still able to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, in its online propaganda, HuT appears to have adopted a line of ‘constructive criticism’ of the Emirate, and certainly does not endorse violent opposition to it.56 Overall, the Taliban’s approach seems to have varied from location to location, often involving attempts to distinguish in practice between members of non-violent extremist groups who establish links to IS-K, and those who do not, even if the standards of proof for charging and detaining individuals are never clear. At the end of November 2022, the Taliban reiterated their ban on organisations suspected of Salafi sympathies or of advocating the Caliphate, suggesting an awareness that the ban was being only loosely enforced at the grassroots level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;impact-mixed-results&quot;&gt;IMPACT: MIXED RESULTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of stopping IS-K recruitment on campuses, the Taliban have faced a serious challenge, strapped as they are for resources, both human and financial. Especially in the early days of the second Emirate, the Taliban lacked suitably trained security and intelligence personnel. In the only publicly available (as of April 2023) breakdown of the Emirate’s budget, released in January 2022, expenditure on security appears at around 40% of the total budget, which would mean up to $800 million per year in 2022. Around 16% of the Emirate’s total budget (about $320 million as of 2022) went specifically to the GDI. This compares unfavourably with the $2.15 billion available to the Islamic Republic in 2021 for defence and public order and safety (54% of the operating budget), on top of billions of US money being pumped directly into the Afghan security forces. While the Taliban have so far confronted a much less threatening situation than the Islamic Republic did in its later years, the salary burden of civil servants alone, inherited from the Islamic Republic, amounted in 2021 to over $170 million per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging by the interviews for this paper, it would appear that, by and large, they have succeeded in turning the campuses into significantly less permissive environments for IS-K to operate in, thanks to a mix of intensified intelligence operations targeting what they call Kharijites and takfiri (‘excommunicators’) on campus, strict control over the campus environment, and effective Taliban deterrence against any form of dissent. Students and staff are investigated for even the most indirect links to IS-K or any other group opposed to the Taliban. Harsh punishment for those suspected of supporting opposition groups also acts as an additional deterrent. Although around a quarter of the 20 individuals contacted (students, university staff, Taliban security officers) believed that recruitment by extremist groups had not halted since the Taliban takeover, the group mentioned most often as being active was HuT, not IS-K. Evidence of ongoing IS-K presence on campuses is scant, in contrast to what was happening before August 2021, when extremist groups were able to spread propaganda in the dormitories. As noted earlier, Kabul University’s dormitories had been identified as a previous hotspot for IS-K activity. In 2021, Taliban security sources said that IS-K activities were taking place on the Kabul campus for some time after the regime change in August 2021, but that, following arrests, these activities stopped. However, some evidence suggests that this was a premature assessment. A year later, one Taliban security source confirmed that arrests of students for IS-K links in university dormitories had occurred in the previous six months. The GDI provided Taliban security officials with a list of students active in takfiri propaganda, who were then arrested. Kabul University students linked to IS-K who came from Logar and Nangarhar provinces were also arrested when they returned to their home provinces, following cross-province coordination between Taliban and GDI officials. This source optimistically stated that no violent extremist activity was ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the optimism of some Taliban officials, others were more worried. This was particularly so in relation to the Faizabad campus of Badakhshan University. Some research contacts, including one in the Taliban’s campus security, believed that recruitment efforts were still going on in Faizabad. Taliban sources have often been evasive about details of arrests, but they confirmed that there had been several. On the Badakhshan University campus, a Taliban source claimed that professors who were inclined toward Salafism and affiliated with IS-K and HuT had been arrested, and that further arrests were likely. He also confirmed detentions of students on the grounds of links to HuT and IS-K. Other Taliban security sources, in Gulbahar and Nangarhar, confirmed arrests on both campuses, but did not provide details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, students or staff have been directly aware of arrests taking place, especially on the Faizabad campus, where all sources knew of regular arrests being made, even if the reasons were not always clear. One student at Kabul University was aware of one arrest of a student on allegations of links to IS-K. At Nangarhar University, in the recent past there have been numerous disappearances of students accused of having links with IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of Taliban success in stifling online IS-K activism is much more questionable. This paper does not draw on direct investigation of IS-K online activities, but rather on interviews and contacts, so any assessment of these activities would be on shaky ground. Moreover, students were unsure about the extent of online activism. One student, for example, claimed that while social networks were a recruitment site for extremist groups, such groups had only a minimal online presence. University staff members offered contrasting views. One stated that the social media recruitment activities of violent extremist groups had increased since the Taliban takeover, but did not give further details or evidence to support these claims. Another, in Badakhshan University, held the opposite view, stating that the Taliban takeover had led to an unprecedented decrease in use of social media by IS-K. Probably the most reliable view is that of one Taliban security officer, who acknowledged that the Taliban were monitoring groups online, and that activism was ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predominant view was that IS-K online activities have become somewhat riskier but are continuing. Revealingly, IS-K has been warning its followers through its social media accounts of Taliban infiltration efforts, exploiting IS-K recruitment efforts on social media. Another risk factor is that the Taliban regularly search mobile phones and monitor students’ social media accounts on campus. According to one student in Parwan, students were too afraid to carry their phones on campus; any content that could be traced to Taliban opponents (even a single photograph) was likely to result in arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K sources claim that, despite the Taliban’s measures, they have still been able to recruit on campuses. Assessments offered by IS-K sources could be questionable, of course, but when cross-checked with each other’s accounts and viewed in the overall context, these accounts do not offer a picture of overwhelming success and seem, therefore, rather plausible. IS-K appears to have coped comparatively well on the Nangarhar University campus. An IS-K source claims that from March to November 2022 the organisation was able to recruit more than 30 students at Nangarhar, most of whom ended up in combat units, with several also joining as preachers and indoctrinators and being dispatched to various locations. In Kabul, by contrast, recruitment into IS-K slowed greatly following the Taliban’s takeover, largely because the Taliban have created an especially thick network of spies and informers there. One cell was reportedly identified by the Taliban but managed to flee before its members were detained. Overall, therefore, considering the distribution of Salafism around Afghanistan (largely confined to the east and northeast) and that Nangarhar University is one of the largest recruitment grounds for IS-K, the yearly recruitment output of IS-K on the campuses could be estimated at not much more than 100 people. These recruits will, however, all be valuable cadres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While recruitment is still going on, the ease with which IS-K is able to attract members should not be exaggerated. One recruiter in Kabul said that of five potential recruits that he chose for targeting and passed on to the followup teams, one joined and four refused; a sixth was being processed as of November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-k-countermeasures-and-prospects&quot;&gt;IS-K COUNTERMEASURES AND PROSPECTS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;adaptation&quot;&gt;ADAPTATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K has not been idly watching while the Taliban tries to shut down its recruitment networks on Afghanistan’s university campuses. Indeed, the majority of interviewees assumed that IS-K recruitment activities were ongoing on social media, but hidden in private channels, even if most of them claimed not to know how recruitment on social media worked. A Taliban security officer explained that while the Taliban can infiltrate Facebook groups, and the use of Facebook by IS-K has decreased, IS-K has switched to using Telegram, Instagram, WhatsApp and Signal. Growing reliance on private social media channels has thus been an important form of adaptation. A staff member at Parwan University agreed that IS-K does not operate directly through social media networks, because of Taliban scrutiny. He concurred that private channels are used to invite potential recruits, giving the examples of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Islamic materials, including innocuous ones such as hadiths (the Prophet’s sayings), are published on these private channels to attract pious students, who are then shown more political material. A student at Parwan University noted that students are added to WhatsApp groups that share a mix of generic religious material and more specific Salafi propaganda, whether they like it or not. These groups are reportedly run anonymously. Another student, in Kabul, claimed that he knew that ‘violent extremist groups’ published material on social media, but since these groups were invite-only and he was not a member, he could not give more information. These accounts corroborate the data that emerged from interviews, discussed above, regarding IS-K activities on Afghanistan’s campuses after the Taliban takeover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another form of adaptation by IS-K has been to move its social media activities abroad, especially to Europe, where there is a large Afghan diaspora. A Taliban security official admitted that even Facebook accounts promoting the downfall of the Emirate are still operated, but by IS-K members based abroad. Following engagement with such outputs, potential recruits could then be passed on to anonymous WhatsApp and Telegram channels, where further vetting takes place before formal recruitment occurs. The Taliban cannot, of course, do much against IS-K propagandists based abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from investing more in reshaped online activities, IS-K might well be still adjusting to the Taliban’s presence on campus. At the time of making these enquiries, only 10 months had passed since the Taliban reopened the campuses, and IS-K may be assessing the new landscape and/or waiting for the Taliban to relax their scrutiny before restarting recruitment activities. To bypass Taliban focus, recruiters could seek to intensify recruitment in Salafileaning mosques that students frequent, for example. The Taliban appear to think the same, and such mosques have time and again been subject to severe restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-promising-environment&quot;&gt;A PROMISING ENVIRONMENT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;University campuses could again become a favourable environment for IS-K recruitment in the longer term, due to widespread student discontent on campus, anti-Taliban sentiment, and a broad sense of despondency and lack of hope for the future. Judging from 15 interviews with university students and teaching staff on four different Afghan campuses (Kabul, Jalalabad, Gulbahar and Faizabad), students are struggling to adapt to new Taliban rules on campus, such as gender segregation and the need to adhere to Taliban dress codes. The threat of Taliban violence for those not abiding by the new rules and the precedent of the Taliban targeting offenders’ families appear to be a source of distress for many students. Many students also feel patronised by the Taliban’s treatment, with research respondents commenting that they were already committed to Islam before the Taliban takeover and did not appreciate being forced to follow the Taliban’s interpretation of the religion. Students claim that they have been forced to repeat prayers because the Taliban does not believe that they have already prayed; that they have been beaten for falling asleep following prayers during Ramadan; that they are forced to listen to preaching by Taliban-affiliated mullahs after prayer time; and that men are forced to wear traditional Afghan clothing to campus, while women were forced to wear black niqabs (before the ban on women in higher education was imposed). Although frustration deriving from these issues is not likely to drive students towards IS-K per se, it is likely to reduce cooperation with the Taliban authorities among students, and therefore make counterterrorism measures harder to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all students cited pessimism regarding the job market postgraduation. Several students expressed a desire to emigrate from Afghanistan immediately following graduation, because of doubts about their ability to find work in the country. A staff member at a private university in Gulbahar claimed that up to 90% of students in private universities had dropped out due to feelings of despondency about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five different university staff members agreed that reductions in teachers’ salaries, increased teaching hours and the departure of large numbers of qualified teachers from Afghanistan were affecting the quality of education. University teachers were reportedly unmotivated and overworked, in particular as a result of the increased teaching hours necessitated by gender segregation (before the ban on women in universities came into place). Students also noted a decline in teaching quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the vast majority of students faced with an uncertain future in Afghanistan will seek to emigrate, a minority of more Salafi-oriented students could become susceptible to IS-K recruitment. Students inclined to Salafism are likely to have taken specific offence at some of the Taliban’s practices on campus for religious reasons, as Salafism runs contrary to several of these, such as the Taliban-mandated dress code for men and women. The Salafis have their own interpretation of Sharia, and what might look like minor differences to outsiders would have major implications for those involved. With anti-Salafi practices widespread on campuses, Taliban attempts to dominate the religious discourse in universities, and the targeting of Salafi scholars and madrasas, strong feelings among Salafi students are likely to be still making them susceptible to IS recruitment. One Taliban security source hinted that for a period after the regime change, Salafis had initially been keen to work with the Taliban, after the Taliban had targeted some of their ulema, but he acknowledged that anti-Taliban sentiment had significantly increased on Badakhshan University campus since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examined the understudied IS-K presence on Afghanistan’s university campuses and the counterterrorism effort that the Taliban regime has mounted against it. It set out to assess the performance of the Taliban in one case study of counterterrorism – against IS-K activities on the campuses – as well as the ways in which IS-K sought to adapt. The research team gathered evidence of a sophisticated IS-K approach to recruitment on Afghanistan’s university campuses, combining face-to-face and remote techniques. It is also clear that IS-K’s recruitment is aimed at a relatively small niche: largely Salafi and Salafi-leaning students. As such, the approach can yield only a limited number of recruits, certainly not exceeding the low hundreds annually. Nonetheless, these are high-quality recruits, on which the highly ideological and disciplined IS-K must rely to sustain its operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban seem indeed to have paid considerable attention to the problem. The days of the Islamic Republic’s half-hearted efforts to deal with IS-K are certainly gone. By denying to IS-K activists the space they once had, the Taliban have constrained IS-K’s ability to recruit. However, the underlying conditions favouring IS-K recruitment persist. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harassment of Salafi students by some of their Hanafi colleagues, which reinforces resentment against the dominant Hanafi school.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heavy-handed treatment of suspects by Taliban police and intelligence, which pushes some towards joining IS-K to seek revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Widespread student frustration over conditions and lack of prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing Taliban pressure on non-violent extremist groups that have roots among students, such as HuT, Jami’at Eslah and others, which might drive some of their members towards IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s approach to counterterrorism on university campuses has, in other words, been focused on repression, with seemingly little, if any, effort towards prevention. The ability of the Taliban to reduce IS-K activities using heavy-handed measures runs the risk of delivering both short-term positive results and long-term counterproductive ones, not least because the Taliban struggle to restrain the behaviour of their sympathisers and indeed anyone holding anti-Salafi views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of a stable prevention policy means that the IS-K’s pool of potential recruits is likely not shrinking, assuming that drivers of recruitment, such as student frustration and Hanafi–Salafi friction, remain constant. Taliban repression might have reduced IS-K’s ability to tap this pool, but this could well be only temporary, especially as IS-K adapts and refines its recruitment techniques. Indeed, even over the relatively short time elapsed since regime change in Kabul (one year and five months at the time of writing), there were already signs that IS-K was adapting by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relying more on private social media channels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving more of its social media activists abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warning its members and sympathisers about the risk of Taliban infiltrators and provocateurs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high level of tension between Hanafi and Salafi on the campuses makes it difficult for the Taliban and Salafi elders to trust each other. Hence, it does seem clear that future prevention policies will be hard to develop and implement. Regardless, without some form of preventive measures, the Taliban might be forcing upon themselves a very long campaign against IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

In sketching the outline of a U.S. grand strategy in Latin America and the Caribbean, this report provides a framework within which to answer critical questions that remain unanswered in U.S. policymaking circles: which level of Chinese engagement the United States should permit versus what it should seek to curtail, as well as the necessarily circumscribed areas where U.S. competition should be resource-backed, well thought out, and creatively messaged. The report offers three categories for thinking through the terms of engagement with China in Latin America and the Caribbean: insulation, curtailment, and competition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard documents that would normally serve as reference points for the terms of engagement—the National Security Strategy and the National Defense Strategy—contain scant mention of LAC. While the Biden administration’s National Security Strategy hits strong notes on “great power competition” with China and a global competition between democracy and autocracy, LAC occupies only two pages of reflection. Further, the section on LAC mentions China only once, in conjunction with Russia and Iran as examples of dangerous extra-hemispheric actors. The National Defense Strategy, meanwhile, contains a mere paragraph about LAC’s important contribution to a stable, peaceful, and prosperous United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it is critically important for the United States to develop a policy on the terms of engagement with China in LAC that would begin to approximate a grand strategy. This policy should aim to compete with China across multiple domains, in a resource-backed, whole-of-government manner that leverages the strengths of the United States’ democratic partners and allies. However, the policy must strike the right balance and avoid overreach—which, in this case, would be asking LAC partners and allies to forgo the occasional benefits of trade and investment with China. One well-known foreign policy analyst summed up this balance well: “Trying to do it all, everywhere, will produce exhaustion and undermine U.S. capacity to address what matters most . . . If it wants to succeed, the United States is going to have to pick its battles carefully.” This is even truer in LAC, a region that is perennially undervalued and under-resourced by the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;levers-of-coercion&quot;&gt;Levers of Coercion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China continues to build upon a formidable set of levers that it can use to coerce countries that challenge it or that pursue policies seen as undermining its core interests. China has become the top trading partner for many countries in South America and the second-largest trading partner for nearly all of LAC. The Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) signature foreign policy program, its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), invests in large infrastructure projects in 21 of LAC’s 34 countries, including sensitive infrastructure such as nuclear power and space stations. More recently, China has commenced a push for its Global Security Initiative. And China has become a key provider of financing to many countries in LAC—to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars—through its state-backed policy banks and its commercial banks. This is to say nothing of China’s growing soft power in LAC through a proliferating number of Confucius Institutes, policymaker and military-to-military exchanges, a presence in multilateral forums such as the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), and the International Liaison Department’s close working relationship with hundreds of political parties in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China continues to increase its economic ties with countries around the world, it threatens to overtake the United States’ economic partnerships with many countries in LAC. Academic studies show that China has strengthened its ties with countries in LAC where U.S. engagement was weakest; in other words, China fills important vacuums when the United States abdicates regional leadership. Perhaps even more concerning, however, is the idea posited by the political economist Albert Hirschman that increased trade between countries, and the eventual growth of trade dependence between states, tends to forge bonds that can contribute to foreign policy convergence. China-LAC convergence on critical issues would severely hinder the United States and effectively neutralize LAC as a strategic asset in broader “great power competition” with China. Increased trade with China engenders domestic constituencies and lobby groups that allow the People’s Republic of China (PRC) further avenues of domestic policy influence. A recent report by the International Republican Institute found that the presence of these groups can lead to a “weakening of democratic institutions, a reduced inclination to support democratic norms globally, and/or increased support for the PRC’s deeply authoritarian model of governance and global ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China-LAC convergence on critical issues would severely hinder the United States and effectively neutralize LAC as a strategic asset in broader “great power competition” with China.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In China’s case, even as it retains a robust toolkit for amassing influence, trade remains the most important and enduring way for it to influence other countries’ politics. Often, trade is the entry point or gateway for Chinese influence. As China’s economy has grown and other countries have become dependent on it, the CCP has shown a propensity to leverage political and economic interdependence in ruthless and capricious ways. From Norwegian salmon to South Korean tourism and from Australian barley, coal, and wine to Lithuanian furniture, over the last decade hundreds of examples of Chinese coercion abound, sometimes over even the slightest annoyances to the CCP. The political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman observe that China, as a result of the last two decades of globalization and global governance mechanisms, has “weaponized interdependence.” As one author recently put it, “Beijing’s long-term objective is to force governments and companies to anticipate, respect, and defer to Chinese interests in all future actions.” One could be forgiven for thinking the author was offering a definition of the word “fealty” rather than describing China’s emerging geopolitical strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China’s predatory behavior predates the more recent examples, Chinese president Xi Jinping provided a theoretical contribution to the CCP’s policy of economic coercion in a set of speeches beginning in 2020, in which he speaks of the “powerful gravitational field” exercised by China’s market behemoth. A series of textbooks for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) focused on Xi’s ideology, uncovered by Ian Easton, contains further statements of political coercion as official CCP policy: “We must gain a grip on foreign government leaders and their business elites by encouraging our companies to invest in their local economies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Through massive subsidies, unfair market access, forced technology transfer, and large state-owned enterprises, China aims to reshape much of the global economy, reorient supply chains through China, and rewire much of the world’s commerce in Beijing’s favor.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although overtaking the United States in total economic size remains at least a nominal policy priority, the CCP grasps that minimizing dependence on other countries, while maximizing other countries’ dependence on China, provides it with the most powerful set of short- to medium-term coercive levers. Indeed, one could read China’s recent moves as an acknowledgement that it will not achieve economic supremacy over the United States any time soon, transitioning instead to become a producer of high-value goods for its adversaries and thus maintain the ability to “wield its very large economy as a strategic weapon.” Studies have shown that the most effective way to weaponize economic interdependence is to maintain a dominant position in a hierarchical network structure—akin to what China aims to create with its privileged companies, which enjoy massive state subsidies and protection from competition by foreign firms. Short of constructing an economy capable of driving innovation in the twenty-first century, Xi’s China can still maintain important tools of coercion over developed and developing countries alike. In LAC, China has focused on industries it calls “new infrastructure,” which includes sensitive areas such as 5G, electricity provision, high-speed rail infrastructure, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through massive subsidies, unfair market access, forced technology transfer, and large state-owned enterprises, China aims to reshape much of the global economy, reorient supply chains through China, and rewire much of the world’s commerce in Beijing’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LAC region is incredibly exposed to Chinese political and economic coercion, and China’s willingness to use its levers of influence has only increased in recent years. Recent examples of coercion encompass pursuing political influence, championing economic interests, reducing Taiwan’s diplomatic allies, and following hard security interests. Even LAC’s largest economies are not immune. For instance, after initial signs that the Bolsonaro administration in Brazil would shut Huawei out of the auction for its 5G spectrum, China threatened to halt Covid-19 vaccinations to Brazil—just as the country was buckling under the weight of a severe pandemic wave. Huawei will now build part of Brazil’s 5G infrastructure. In Paraguay, the last country in South America to recognize Taiwan, China demanded it drop its recognition of Taiwan before it could buy Covid-19 vaccines. In Ecuador, nearly $20 billion in debt taken out by autocratic president Rafael Correa has hamstrung the government for years. Although China recently renegotiated two deals after it came under significant pressure to do so, the damage was already done. For years, Ecuador’s repayment of its unsustainable debt burden to China remained tethered to the performance of its oil industry, and in particular, its state-owned oil company. A congressional committee found that the inability to sell Ecuador’s oil on the spot market had cost the country about $5 billion, while recently renegotiated debt deals permitting more oil to be sold on the spot market would net the country only an additional $28 million in revenues. Ecuador’s debts to China also largely froze the country’s development goals for years as it was forced to double down on commodities production and export. Worse yet, Ecuador was forced to drill for oil in sensitive biozones in the Amazon—areas in which it had previously promised not to drill, in an international effort to preserve indigenous territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, indebtedness and Chinese influence in the government of then-president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner paved the way for the Espacio Lejano space station in Neuquén Province, the first Chinese deep space station built outside of China. The center is run by the China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General, a sub-entity to the PLA, while Argentina has no oversight whatsoever over the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from these highly specific examples of targeted political and economic coercion, there are more general concerns about LAC’s unsustainable indebtedness to China. For instance, according to the IDB, 50 percent of total government-to-government debt is in China’s hands. LAC is also willing to accept shoddily constructed or potential dual-use infrastructure projects through the BRI. So far, China has mostly resisted attempts to force it to write down debt in the developing world, arguing that it, too, is a developing country. Critically, a 2021 report by Aid Data shows that, in addition to the hundreds of billions in publicly known debt, the developing world has nearly $400 billion in “hidden debt” to China—knowledge of debt levels that was not publicly available previously because it did not appear on government balance sheets. Much of this debt is held by LAC countries. In general, Aid Data finds that “for every dollar of aid to low-income and middle-income countries, China has provided $9 of debt. The opposite is true of the US: For every dollar of debt that it provides to low-income and middle-income countries, it provides at least $9 of aid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a 2021 hearing of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, China’s construction of potential “dual-use” infrastructure through the BRI was a major topic of concern. The PRC counts a total of approximately 40 port-building or upgrading projects in LAC, almost all of them handled by Chinese state-owned enterprises and with some situated in countries geographically proximate to the United States. Further, the PRC has over 150 planned transportation infrastructure projects in the Western Hemisphere that contain some type of port or logistics hub. Despite the purported pacific nature of these facility upgrades, China has been credibly accused in the past—in the United Arab Emirates and Equatorial Guinea—of surreptitiously building military applications into port facilities, later exploited by the PLA. To punctuate the security concern, a recent report by Maritime Executive concludes: “It turns out that one-third of ports in which China made economic investments have hosted and also resupplied military vessels of the People’s Liberation Army Navy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see how China’s drive for economic and political leverage in pursuit of its wide-ranging interests will have an impact on LAC’s unconsolidated democracies, threaten its democratic traditions, and contribute to a breakdown in rule of law and greater corruption. Whether willful or indirect, China’s increasing engagement has coincided with an uptick in democratic backsliding and a rise in authoritarian governance throughout the LAC region. Any U.S. strategy for the terms of engagement in LAC needs to account for how China’s pursuit of its geopolitical interests may be distorting LAC’s democratic development. The good news is that there are sound strategies to blunt the effects of China’s approach to weaponized interdependence and to “deny, deflect, and deter” its predatory economic policies in a region such as LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-contours-past-and-present&quot;&gt;Strategic Contours, Past and Present&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous eras, the United States pursued a grand strategy centered on strategic denial against rival powers in LAC. As part of this strategy, the United States sought to prevent powerful rivals from establishing a strategic foothold in the region that might impact the United States’ influence and security. Due to the perceived absence of significant extra-hemispheric actors in the region after the Cold War, for several decades the United States neglected LAC and focused its major foreign policy efforts on other regions. Strategic denial as a grand strategy fell out of vogue. However, China’s decade and a half of deep engagement has put the region back on the radar, even as the United States continues to lack broad strategic guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In thinking through the broad contours of a twenty-first century grand strategy for great power competition in LAC, the United States should seek to shape the environment such that it constrains China’s negative behavior—mostly its appetite for political and economic coercion—and encourages constructive activities that could benefit LAC. By no means should the United States seek to interrupt or interfere in every aspect of China’s multifaceted engagement with LAC. Such a strategy is both unrealistic and likely to generate resentment and blowback from U.S. partners in the region. With respect to some aspects of China’s engagement that have become routine and even welcome from the regional perspective, the United States cannot reasonably attempt to block such involvement without severely damaging its relationships with partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should not stand by idly, either. On the contrary, the United States should pursue an active, muscular, three-pronged grand strategy in LAC focused around three major principles: insulation, curtailment, and competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States should pursue an active, muscular, three-pronged grand strategy in LAC focused around three major principles: insulation, curtailment, and competition.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Insulation strategies will be the most commonly employed. The United States should work to help fortify and insulate countries in LAC from the most adverse impacts of China’s continued engagement and ensure that democracy remains the preferred political system in the region. The United States will not prevail in a dollar-for-dollar competition with China on development projects in LAC. As one scholar rightly points out, there is a “self-defeating logic” to transactional diplomacy versus China in LAC. The United States also lacks—for good reason—China’s ability to direct capital from its private sector to mobilize in service of state and party goals. Indeed, China’s mechanisms of party control over the private sector provide strong reason to believe this is an inefficient use of capital. These realities mean that China will, of course, continue to play an outsized role as a partner in LAC’s development strategies and economic growth for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, insulation implies helping LAC countries operate within a framework of transparency, rule of law, and equal opportunity that will ensure that the region remains true to its democratic traditions and obligations under the Inter-American Democratic Charter. Proper insulation strategies will take into account the region’s own institutional weaknesses and corruption and help LAC fortify institutions and get the most out of its engagement with China, all while protecting it from some of the most corrosive effects of that engagement. In short, insulation strategies aim to blunt elements of the large power asymmetry between LAC countries and China, permitting China fewer opportunities to exploit that asymmetry to its benefit and ensuring a more level playing field and greater policy autonomy for LAC countries. Insulation strategies should also protect LAC democracies from turns toward populist governments that invite further involvement by China in problematic ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned already, China is assiduously pursuing advantages in international affairs that will furnish the opportunity to coerce countries economically and politically. Insulation strategies should seek to deter Beijing by puncturing its confidence that pursuing coercion will yield positive results against the United States and LAC countries. Maintaining a favorable balance of dependence and a strong ability and desire to resist coercion in a wide range of areas may be the decisive factor in any strategy aimed at competing against China in LAC. After all, Vladimir Putin’s devastating invasion of Ukraine hinged significantly on his (spurious) belief that Russia had attained enough European dependence on its energy exports that the European Union would not come to Kyiv’s aid. Avoiding similar calculations by Xi’s China will be critical to effective deterrence and grand strategy in all regions of the world, LAC included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curtailment:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to helping countries strengthen internal mechanisms and compete on a level playing field, it is also important to curtail certain aspects of China’s engagement that impact democratic traditions and threaten policy autonomy in LAC, such as the increasing involvement of untrusted vendors in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector. Curtailment involves clearly messaging U.S. redlines and holding firm on these redlines. Because of its potential to ruffle U.S. relationships in LAC, curtailment should be selective and pursued only when China’s engagement truly threatens (1) LAC’s policy autonomy, (2) LAC’s democratic traditions, or (3) key U.S. interests in the region. There should be a set of extremely high standards for asking U.S. partners and allies in LAC to bear the costs of forgoing a relationship with China in a particular area. An unnecessarily expansive pursuit of curtailment could not only result in relationship friction but also provide fodder to China’s (debilitating) argument that the United States is interested in LAC only because of China’s presence. Ideally, curtailment strategies would be paired with competition strategies, thus marshaling resources to ensure that a U.S. alternative is made available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; Complementary to efforts insulating the region from adverse impacts of China’s engagement and curtailing certain types of engagement, the United States will also need to develop a resource-backed strategy to ensure that viable democratic alternatives are on the table in areas where the United States can effectively compete. As one author recently noted, “the U.S. is well advised to leverage the enormous size, effectiveness, and agility of private-sector capital against China’s substantial but ‘clumsy capital.’” In service of these goals, the United States has free trade agreements with a substantial portion of the LAC region. This architecture, built over decades, gives it advantages over the CCP in furnishing private-sector alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with curtailment strategies, out of both necessity and resource scarcity, the United States should prioritize only a handful of areas in which it can provide a meaningful and competitive alternative to Chinese development and investment in the region. Examples include ICT and digital connectivity, mining and critical minerals, renewable energy, and healthcare systems. To accomplish this, the U.S. government will have to rewrite rules that constrain the agility of agencies like the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to aid middle-income regions like LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, an important note on messaging is in order. In pursuing this three-pronged strategy, the United States should project a desire to enhance the hemispheric relationship and ensure its policy autonomy, rather than present an approach that emphasizes anti-China policies and the dangers of the Chinese Communist Party. The strategy should go beyond China and be aimed at strengthening the region’s democratic institutions, fighting its entrenched corruption, and catalyzing its economic development. Notwithstanding China’s current impact, countries in LAC often have a different perspective than the United States with respect to China’s role in the region. Facing domestic economic challenges, governments in LAC are much more responsive to the immediate benefits of China’s engagement and display ostensibly little concern for the second-order impacts of unsustainable debt, vulnerability to coercion, and democratic backsliding that typically occur on a longer time horizon. Due to these differences in perspective and the importance of allies in shaping effective policy, the United States will need to be more intentional with its public diplomacy to ensure that any new policies in the region are seen in the context of a willing partner ready to help, as opposed to a defensive partner seeking to minimize China’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. policymakers generally understand that diplomatic statements criticizing China and suggesting that LAC forgo its relationship with China and align with the United States do not play well in the region. As one scholar observes: “The U.S. must thus work to refine its communication, within the boundaries of honesty, to credibly emphasize its interest in the well-being of the region to which it is connected by geography, commerce, and family.” Particularly, messaging strategy should emphasize preserving the policy autonomy of LAC, as well as a U.S. desire to fortify democratic, market-oriented institutions that will allow the region to engage on a more equal playing field with all countries in the world—not just China. Doubling down on the importance of market-led growth and the U.S. private sector will be even more important in light of China’s push to expand its statist model and the region’s turn to greater state-led policy solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing this strategy will require appropriating resources through relevant agencies to insulate LAC more effectively from the most corrosive elements of China’s engagement. Policymakers should understand the importance of pursuing this three-pronged grand strategy so that foreign policy resources in LAC are not outsourced to other regions. Due to the global nature of U.S. strategy, resources are often moved from LAC to other theaters in times of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key agencies that can ensure that these resource constraints do not present themselves include the National Security Council (NSC), the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the DFC, among others. These agencies are critical to high-level diplomatic engagement, messaging, economic development strategy, and commercial engagement. They are the logical place to begin with the implementation of grand strategy in LAC. Multilateral organizations and the private sector will also be crucial for the United States’ revamped efforts in the region. Beyond highlighting common ground with aspects of the region’s agenda, the United States would be best served by returning to the basics and helping governments remember that the private sector is the best engine of economic growth and human initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The three-pronged approach championed in this report implies deep U.S. engagement and partnership with LAC to an extent that has not existed in the twenty-first century.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this report proceeds in three broad sections, each corresponding to an element of the three-pronged grand strategy. First, it assesses aspects of China’s engagement with LAC, identifying where the United States should help insulate countries from the riskiest and most adverse impacts of that engagement. Second, it offers recommendations for the aspects of China’s engagement with the region that the United States should seek to curtail—an unsettled debate among policymakers. Finally, the report concludes with an argument for the priority industries in which the United States should seek to engage in competition, those where a fully resourced policy will allow them to furnish viable alternatives to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;insulate&quot;&gt;Insulate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most aspects of China’s engagement with LAC will continue, given the region’s need for economic growth and development. Directly interfering with China’s engagement could also confirm the suspicion of many countries in LAC that the United States is a self-interested hegemon. As such, in these areas, there are ways in which the United States can act to help countries insulate themselves from China’s corrosive impact without appearing to pursue anti-China policies. The United States should ensure that the interactions between China and its partners in the region occur in a transparent fashion and on a level playing field. A recent poll by the International Republican Institute shows that majorities of citizens in four key LAC countries are unaware of the CCP’s influence and China’s investment in their countries. By promoting transparency, providing technical assistance, establishing safeguards against corruption, and strengthening institutional support mechanisms, the United States can enable partners to strengthen their internal frameworks for investment and external engagement. This section proceeds with an analysis of China’s commercial and development engagement followed by its institutional engagement and provides mechanisms for insulating countries from adverse impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;commercial-and-development-engagement&quot;&gt;Commercial and Development Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s approach toward strengthening its own economy has led it to engage with LAC in many critical sectors. As leftist populist governments emerge throughout the region, leaders are arguably more receptive to increased Chinese engagement as well as to internal policies that may lead to democratic deficits (albeit China’s presence is now hemisphere-wide). Venezuela serves as an illustrative example of ever-closer engagement with China that has coincided with dramatic democratic backsliding. Chinese economic assistance under both Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro allowed Venezuela to maintain authoritarian governance mechanisms that have pulled it away from the democratic traditions and regional institutions of the hemisphere. Backsliding has spread to other countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, which are all increasingly turning to China for economic assistance. Without strong institutions and insulation mechanisms to protect democracy, these countries could witness varying levels of democratic backsliding, given the nature of China’s engagement. Long-term impacts on democracy have been demonstrated to be most prominent in China’s infrastructure investment and within the region’s extractive industry, as well as within its lending practices, violations of labor standards, and laws protecting the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding infrastructure, President Xi Jinping has established ambitious trade and investment goals with the region, embodied by the fact that 21 LAC countries have signed onto China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in just the past three and a half years—with more expected in the coming years. From a U.S. perspective, focusing messaging on the BRI as “debt-trap diplomacy”—irrespective of its veracity—does not find a receptive audience in LAC because investment is urgently needed in the region. Without an alternative, the Chinese offer is the best offer because it is often the only offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States cannot and should not attempt to block BRI investment in the region, it can ensure that BRI investments are made in a transparent framework that protects countries from unsustainable debt. While the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is the United States’ recently announced alternative to the BRI, it will take years before it potentially competes with China’s infrastructure investment—if ever. Nonetheless, the United States should fuel investment from PGII to LAC as an alternative to the BRI. Given the level of investment needed, the United States will need to insulate the region from the corrosive impacts that these large infrastructure investment deals can have. For instance, China’s presence in the energy sectors of various countries should be cause for alarm. In Brazil, Chinese companies own or partially own over 300 power plants, accounting for 10 percent of Brazil’s national energy generation capacity. Additionally, Chinese companies own 12 percent of Brazil’s energy transmission infrastructure. Both pose significant points of potential leverage for the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to infrastructure, China has also made large investments in the region’s extractive industries, especially in the critical mineral supply chain. Large investments in this space have allowed China to establish strategic footholds in various countries throughout the region. Just as with infrastructure, however, how corrosive these investments’ impacts on democracy are depends on the stability and strength of a country’s institutions. Chile’s copper and lithium industries, for instance, have been regulated at the national level for several decades, and the strength of its framework for foreign investment has insulated it better than other countries from the negative impacts that could emerge from growing Chinese investment. Argentina, on the other hand, does not have the same institutional frameworks, being governed at the local and provincial level with little accountability; amid economic turmoil and growing commercial engagement with China, the country could witness backsliding from unregulated economic involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s current political and economic crisis demonstrates several key lessons on how the United States can help countries in LAC avoid the most democracy-eroding impacts of increased Chinese commercial and development engagement. While Sri Lanka carries much of the blame for its ongoing debt crisis, China’s lending practices have played an outsized role. Sri Lanka’s experience provides a crucial lesson for the Western Hemisphere: avoid investment deals for both infrastructure and extractive industries that might lead to unsustainable debt burdens and provide countries with the necessary tools for evaluating future deals. Furthermore, it also shows that the United States should work to protect countries from incurring subsequent debt and restructuring existing debt that will not further deteriorate into economic crises. Recent studies on this topic demonstrate that China is likely to respond to overindebted countries either with new lines of credit or, concerningly, currency swap deals that open new avenues of potential political leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context of increasing Chinese economic engagement, there are several ways in which the United States could move to insulate the region from China’s corrosive influence. Effective solutions include promoting investment principles, providing technical assistance for debt restructuring, offering support for transparency, and strengthening partners’ institutions and transaction processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-promote-quality-infrastructure-investment-qii-principles&quot;&gt;1. Promote quality infrastructure investment (QII) principles.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One crucial mechanism through which the United States should insulate the region from China’s BRI investments is by promoting quality infrastructure investment principles. Fortunately, the United States, Japan, and Australia have cofounded a certification mechanism for infrastructure projects that meet robust international quality infrastructure investment principles. This initiative, the Blue Dot Network, should continue to be pursued on a global scale so that the United States can help create more transparency and quality data for development projects in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of State should aim to make Blue Dot principles a standard for any new infrastructure projects in the region, including those through the BRI and PGII. As an already under-resourced region, LAC should be made a key priority for the United States when pursuing infrastructure investment principles. This will help countries in the region have access to more information on the track record of certain companies when pursuing large infrastructure deals that have the potential to increase their debt burden. In this capacity, the Blue Dot Network serves as an international institutional mechanism that can strengthen commercial and development engagement in the region, thereby insulating countries from the potential adverse impacts of infrastructure investment deals. (The Blue Dot Network is certainly not the only workable framework; there are others that could serve as strong frameworks for insulation mechanisms, such as the United Kingdom’s New Engineering Contracts, which have been used successfully in Peru.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this same workstream, the United States should also work with cofounders Japan and Australia, as well as other allies like South Korea and Taiwan, to contribute to the development of democratic principles in LAC. Bringing allies into the conversation about infrastructure principles in the region may catalyze a larger conversation on how extra-hemispheric actors can provide resources for further democratic development. For instance, both Japan and South Korea have a vested interest in the lithium industry, with companies like Japanese Toyota Tsusho and South Korean steelmaker Posco having large investments in lithium extraction sites in Argentina. It is in the interest of both Japan and South Korea as well as the United States for governments to cooperate to establish stronger investment principles within the lithium industry, for the benefit of both the region and their own companies. As a broader line of work, the United States should engage with allies that already have an economic interest in strengthening democratic principles for commercial and development engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-provide-technical-assistance-and-establish-safeguards-for-debt-vulnerable-countries&quot;&gt;2. Provide technical assistance and establish safeguards for debt-vulnerable countries.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mechanism to help insulate the region from China’s adverse impacts is to help countries restructure debt resulting from Chinese sovereign lending and to protect these debt-vulnerable countries from incurring subsequent Chinese debt by increasing technical assistance and establishing safeguards. The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Technical Assistance (OTA) should increase its engagement with regional partners to ensure that countries do not incur large amounts of subsequent debt on deals that could further disrupt their economies. As a lesson from Sri Lanka’s current debt crisis, the United States should encourage countries to work through the Paris Club and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to restructure their debt and establish this as a safeguard to ensure that countries in the region do not incur further debt. Through the Paris Club, both Argentina and Suriname have been able to restructure their debt in ways that may allow them to address current economic challenges at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the United States should also provide a capital increase for the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to strengthen its ability to help countries in LAC achieve sustainable and serviceable debt structures. The State Department should advance diplomatic engagement with members of the IDB to work on increasing capital for the explicit purpose of providing safeguards to protect debt-vulnerable countries. By increasing the strength and abilities of the Paris Club, the IMF, and the IDB, the United States can help countries in the region avoid situations like what occurred in Ecuador under President Rafael Correa, when the country had to pay off its Chinese debt with oil. Two presidents later, Ecuador still struggles to pay down its Chinese debt, and direct negotiations with Beijing on debt relief have yielded little in savings on the outstanding debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;3-support-transparency-measures-in-infrastructure-and-extractive-industries&quot;&gt;3. Support transparency measures in infrastructure and extractive industries.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After its withdrawal from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in 2017, the United States should reconsider becoming an implementing member once again. The EITI aims to improve transparency standards, strengthen the governance of critical minerals, mitigate corruption risks across the value chain, and increase contract and data disclosure requirements. Only 11 countries in LAC are currently implementing members of EITI: Argentina, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Peru, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. If the United States joined, this could catalyze other countries in the region to strengthen their own extractive sectors. Moreover, while the United States provides support for EITI implementation through USAID, as exemplified by its bilateral assistance to members like Colombia and Guyana, as an implementing member the United States could further demonstrate its work as a partner to countries in the region working to embed transparency in their extractive industries. Increasing the United States’ focus on these standards would help insulate LAC from corrosive impacts to democracy by further protecting industries that will be critical for the future. In this context, the United States should both seek to join EITI and increase USAID funding through EITI explicitly for bilateral assistance to countries in the region as a step for safeguarding institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The region’s vibrant civil societies should be seen as allies in this effort, since one of the most effective ways to expose China’s practices is through public scrutiny. When evidence of corruption, poor labor standards, and environmental abuses have come to light, several Chinese investment projects in the region have been canceled. Basic research and data collection, funneled to watchdog organizations, journalists, media outlets, and academics can help to amplify the denouncement of bad practices. Additionally, such information sharing would have the benefit of making these denouncements take on local character, as opposed to coming from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another idea worthy of further exploration is the use of state-regulated trust funds for public investments. Trust funds for public infrastructure projects should be managed by private financial entities; in LAC, prudential regulation is strong and one of the best in the developing world. For instance, Colombia has positive experiences with the use of trust funds for public investment to execute projects faster, with higher quality, and largely corruption-free. High transparency standards mean corrosive Chinese investment could be curtailed while simultaneously attracting more Western investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;4-strengthen-institutional-and-transactional-support&quot;&gt;4. Strengthen institutional and transactional support.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s reputation for deploying resources without imposing the slightest conditions can be dangerous for countries in the region. Lax institutions and processes are prone to elite capture, corruption, breakdown of rule of law, and other types of corrosive impacts on large commercial and development deals. Given that China’s engagement with the region is more recent compared to its engagement elsewhere, many governments also lack a depth of skills and knowledge on engaging with Chinese partners. To strengthen institutions and processes, the Department of State could lead programs that would help countries with contract evaluation and broad project planning support. Furthermore, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) should increase its partnerships with countries in LAC to strengthen their own foreign investment review mechanisms. Indeed, the State Department, in combination with regional embassies, could conduct a “CFIUS roadshow” to share best practices with the region’s governments and work with those countries that do not have investment review platforms to create ones that are in line with the national security interests of their countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are strong incentives to reform procurement systems across the region to help build more quickly and protect bureaucrats from legal prosecution. Red tape, the lowest-price criteria to select winners in infrastructure projects, a paucity of bidders in each tender process, and a dearth of human capital in procurement agencies are some of the region’s greatest challenges today. Lowest-price criteria mean that Chinese bids face little competition—often they are the only bids—because the lowest price is established too low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;institutional-engagement&quot;&gt;Institutional Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its institutional engagement, China has aggressively sought to broaden its influence in multilateral institutions across the region. China has forged ties with several regional organizations, including the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), and the Bolivarian Alliance for the People of our Americas (ALBA). It has also gained access to development funds from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), despite not being part of the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the U.S. perspective, China’s engagement with CELAC is the most concerning of all institutions, as CELAC excludes both the United States and Canada and therefore gives China more leeway in working with countries in the region. Moreover, countries such as Mexico and Argentina have demonstrated a desire to conduct regional matters through CELAC—as opposed to through the long-standing traditional forum, the Organization of American States (OAS), which is committed to defending democracy in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s agenda within institutions like CELAC and the IDB may not necessarily lead to corrosive impacts on democracy, but its ability to frame a more favorable view of Chinese commercial and development engagement could lead to long-term spillover effects for the region’s democracies if they are not insulated prior to increased engagement. While larger countries in the region have led the charge away from the OAS, Central American countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are backsliding, and a lack of U.S. involvement in the region’s institutions could allow democratic weaknesses to continue festering in these countries. The United States’ current approach of remaining silent and using discreet diplomatic efforts to work with its partners is allowing allies like Mexico to push further against policies that support the region’s democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, to the extent possible, the United States should work to insulate LAC from the potential long-term effects of increased Chinese engagement in the region’s institutions. In this regard, helpful solutions might include incentives for conducting regional business through the OAS and shaping the United States’ participation in regional forums as a partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-provide-incentives-to-countries-to-conduct-their-most-important-matters-through-the-oas&quot;&gt;1. Provide incentives to countries to conduct their most important matters through the OAS.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure that the United States remains an active leader in the region’s commercial and development engagement, it needs to continue to be a key member of the region’s institutions. If countries turn fully to CELAC to solve regional challenges, the United States will not be able to provide its assistance for ensuring that the region’s commercial and development deals are transparent and democratic. As such, to incentivize countries to commit to the OAS, the United States could offer a reorganization of the institution. For instance, it could create a new council that puts the United States on an equal membership status with large regional players like Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and Mexico, some of which have been leaning toward CELAC. Additionally, it could offer more U.S. support as it pertains to security cooperation in the region by allocating more resources to the Unites States Southern Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-shape-the-us-governments-participation-in-regional-forums-as-a-partner&quot;&gt;2. Shape the U.S. government’s participation in regional forums as a partner.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the 2022 Summit of the Americas, countries in the region were disappointed with the lack of resources and new initiatives from the United States. Additionally, several countries boycotted the summit—including Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala—due to the United States’ decision to not invite Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba. President Alberto Fernández of Argentina delivered a critical speech of the United States’ past policy decisions. The United States will not be able to insulate LAC if the region is not willing to accept its assistance. In this context, the United States needs to be a more active participant in regional forums and needs to deliver on its promises. While the Summit of the Americas may have been a good opportunity for it, the United States should still act to address the concerns of its regional partners. It can do so by increasing resources and acting as a partner for the region’s development. This may include a restructuring of the IDB and the OAS, but the changes that are made must be in conversation with partners in the region if they are to be successful in shifting the institutional climate. The driving question must remain what the United States can do with the region—not for the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;curtail&quot;&gt;Curtail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its direct impact on democracy, there are areas where China’s involvement should be curtailed. Many countries in the region face political instability, social unrest, and weakening democracy. In consolidated authoritarian regimes, like Venezuela, China has provided surveillance technologies and other financial support to uphold the Maduro regime. This type of support has also spread to other countries experiencing authoritarian tendencies, such as El Salvador and Guatemala. Further, through its Digital Silk Road, China provided Ecuador with 4,000 Chinese-made cameras for a “smart cities” program aimed at reducing crime—but at the same time shared the video footage with the feared domestic intelligence agency under President Rafael Correa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in this context that some of China’s engagement needs to not only be insulated but fully kept out in order to avoid a permanent turn away from democracy. This corresponds to the United States’ “redlines” for Chinese engagement in the region. As the United States shapes these policies, it will be important to take into consideration which of its concerns are shared with LAC countries, because curtailing aspects of China’s engagement will require partnership with U.S. allies in the region. From the United States’ perspective, the most pressing aspect of engagement to curtail falls in the ICT sector. Due to the potentially destructive impacts that untrusted Chinese 5G vendors and the use of surveillance technologies could have on governance and democracy, the United States should continue its efforts to curtail them. The most challenging aspect of this part of the strategy is that most countries in the region do not see the negative impacts on democratic governments of China’s ICT engagement the same way the United States does. However, by the time LAC sees these negative impacts, it may be too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ict-5g-networks-and-surveillance-technologies&quot;&gt;ICT: 5G Networks and Surveillance Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary areas of China’s engagement that the United States should seek to curtail is the ICT industry, from untrusted 5G vendors to Chinese-provided surveillance technologies. In established autocracies like Venezuela and Cuba, China has intentionally undermined democracy by providing surveillance technologies to the Maduro Regime and restricting internet service during Cuba’s protests in July of 2021. State-owned enterprises, like China’s National Electronics Import and Export Corporation (CEIEC), and Chinese technology companies, like Huawei and ZTE, are equally as dangerous when it comes to challenging democratic institutions in the region. As it pertains to private investment and corporate relations, China’s state-driven capitalist model has made it difficult to ascertain when and where companies are acting of their own accord or in the furtherance of Chinese state policy. Continued controversy over China’s untrusted 5G vendors illustrates this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a difficult conversation to have with partners in LAC, as they receive digital services and technologies from China that the United States cannot yet offer. The Clean Network initiative advanced during the Trump administration demonstrates the region’s different viewpoint on this matter clearly. Nearly 60 countries around the world joined the Clean Network. However, only three of those were in LAC: Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Ecuador. Even though the Biden administration has chosen not to pursue the Clean Network initiative, countries in the region were not very receptive to the original plan. For example, despite Brazil having joined the Clean Network in November 2020, in early 2021 it backed out of its commitment when it allowed Huawei to participate in its 5G auction—in large part because China was withholding vaccines from Brazil during the depths of the pandemic as a bargaining chip. Moreover, Ecuador joined the initiative as part of a deal with the DFC in which it would receive nearly $2.8 billion to pay off Chinese loans (similarly to the Clean Networks initiative, the Biden administration has since abandoned this deal). This context demonstrates that the argument for greater transparency in telecommunications has not worked in the region, as countries merely seek the most effective and cost-efficient option—which in many cases has been Huawei. As countries in the region struggle economically, limiting telecommunications options can be damaging to the United States’ foreign policy if there are no other options that are comparatively similar from a cost standpoint. For this reason, the ICT sector is an area in which the United States should seek to curtail Chinese involvement, but it must also find ways to provide a competitive alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-reduce-the-gap-between-huawei-and-other-5g-competitors&quot;&gt;1. Reduce the gap between Huawei and other 5G competitors.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei leads the 5G industry in LAC with at least 30 percent of the market share, in large part because of Chinese subsidies that make the cost of infrastructure and network service lower than what unsubsidized competitors can provide. Directly banning Chinese vendors from the region has proven to be an ineffective strategy, and as such, the United States and its allies should work to provide a feasible alternative that would curtail increased Chinese market participation. The United States should consider heavier use of industrial policy in conjunction with the European Union, Japan, Australia, and Korea, among other allies, to help 5G competitors—like Eriksson and Nokia—to reduce the financial burden on countries in LAC if they choose to go with an alternative that is not Huawei. Through reforms to Export-Import Bank (EXIM) rules, such as lowering American content requirements for export credits, the United States would be able to support the development of Eriksson, Nokia, and other trusted vendors in the region, despite them not being U.S. companies. Additionally, through PGII, the United States should prioritize its digital pillar to mobilize investment in the ICT sector with trusted vendors. As part of this effort, DFC funding could be used to bring in trusted vendors into countries like Ecuador, a country with which the DFC already has an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-prevent-the-expansion-of-surveillance-technology-systems&quot;&gt;2. Prevent the expansion of surveillance technology systems.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments in LAC have accepted the use of surveillance technologies at an increasing rate, with many countries citing them as a solution to reducing crime and increasing public safety. In a region where military dictatorships governed in the not-too-distant past, the use of surveillance technologies feeds into a worrying trend of democratic backsliding. Growing use of surveillance presents a dilemma for democratic governments as they seek to make their countries safer at the expense of the privacy of their citizens. The Department of State should convey the adverse effects of surveillance technologies to regional partners and work with them to increase accountability and transparency in deals that countries sign with companies providing these new technologies. In the worst cases, the U.S. government should consider the Treasury Department’s ability to use sanctions—as it has elsewhere—against companies providing surveillance technologies to U.S. allies. However, as long as the region’s homicides continue to represent such an outsized percentage of global homicides—usually around one-third of the global total, despite the region representing just 8 percent of the global population—the temptation for surveillance technology will be strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parallel efforts should be made in the space of data protection. The United States could promote the adherence of LAC governments to the Data Protection Law International Treaty. The treaty, formally known as the Convention 108 and born in the European Union has 55 signatories, three of them in LAC (Argentina, Mexico, and Uruguay). Convention 108 imposes minimum standards for personal data protection to prevent abuses from national and foreign governments. Treaty signatories are required to create an autonomous agency to adhere to its principles. The Treaty is important because China does not recognize personal data protection as a right, and Chinese law states that if a country imposes limits on China’s access to personal data, corrective measures can be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthen-regional-ict-and-cybersecurity-cooperation&quot;&gt;Strengthen regional ICT and cybersecurity cooperation.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mechanism to prevent untrusted vendors from further disseminating throughout the region is to strengthen regional ICT and cybersecurity cooperation. As one of the least developed regions in terms of its digital environment, LAC is struggling to cultivate human capital for cybersecurity. While the OAS’s Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism (CICTE) has experience in developing national cybersecurity strategies, there is no targeted effort at cybersecurity for telecommunications. Through CISA Global within the Department of Homeland Security, the United States could seek to increase capacity building with regional partners as a method for improving the overall digital environment as it pertains to telecommunications. As the ICT sector continues to grow in the region, capacity-building efforts can help protect countries as broadband investment expands. To prevent the further expansion of untrusted vendors, the United States should work with the IDB to establish policies that would eliminate ICT projects with untrusted vendors in the region and help countries institutionalize processes that increase their capacity to screen potential ICT infrastructure suppliers for transparency and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compete&quot;&gt;Compete&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its arrival in the region, China has invested large amounts of funding in both commercial engagement and development assistance with countries in LAC. Through its investments, China has changed the regional status quo and attempted to “rewire” the region’s commerce through Beijing, to the point that it is becoming a more influential geopolitical player than the United States in many respects. For instance, China is the region’s second-largest trading partner after the United States and the number one trading partner when accounting only for South America. These trade relationships are the basis for partnerships in the region, as many other critical policy decisions are made based on their impact on trade with other countries. While some of China’s commercial and development engagement benefits LAC, U.S.-based alternatives that establish democratic safeguards and transparency can help increase the options available to countries in the region as they pursue economic development initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, another crucial component of a revamped U.S. strategy in LAC needs to involve channeling resources into industries where the United States can provide viable alternatives to China. While the United States cannot be competitive in every industry, it should reform its strategy to focus on areas in which competing can create a level playing field and strengthen U.S. participation in the region to showcase the importance of democratic traditions. As the United States seeks to ally-shore and nearshore supply chains, it should do so in the critical industries of the future that will help both the United States and LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a region that is unlikely to see a substantial boost in federal funds and policy attention from U.S. policymakers, the United States will be most effective if it chooses a few key priority areas in which to compete with China so that it can make the best use of its limited resources. It is better to understand the domestic and institutional constraints rather than failing to deliver on promises to partners. For instance, the United States has found it challenging to implement new free trade agreements (FTAs) in the region due to domestic constraints. While China is negotiating FTAs with countries like Ecuador and Uruguay, the United States should focus on what it can do in the region, as opposed to promising FTAs that it cannot achieve because of fractious trade politics. In this context, some of the industries in which the United States can and should be competing with China in LAC include ICT and digital connectivity, mining and critical minerals, renewable energy, and healthcare systems. Fortunately, these are also areas in which LAC governments have a strong interest in cooperating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large part of the U.S. strategy will rely on multilateral engagement and private sector-led growth, which could necessitate a heavier use of industrial policy and the development of attractive investment frameworks to further incentivize the private sector to engage with LAC countries. Increasing ties in these industries will require a whole-of-government approach to allocate additional resources to the region. It will require the DFC, USAID, and other relevant agencies to engage in creating a better investment climate in countries across the area. It will also require leveraging U.S. influence at the IDB and the IMF to bring in resources. Given the aforementioned shortage of federal funds for LAC, to be a competitive player in the region the United States will need a strong policy revamp, with many government agencies, multilateral institutions, and private sector companies playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-scale-up-ict-and-digital-connectivity-efforts&quot;&gt;1. Scale up ICT and digital connectivity efforts.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadband connectivity and digital technologies will increase at a rapid rate in LAC over the next several years, with the 5G market alone projected to generate over $28 billion in revenue by 2030. As the region begins to scale up 5G infrastructure, however, Huawei and ZTE are better positioned than competitors like Eriksson and Nokia due to lower costs and existing infrastructure. Huawei, already predominant, possesses a unique opportunity to further consolidate the market if policies are not established to limit the ability of untrusted vendors to operate in the region. Digital and technological communications need to be at the top of the United States’ national security agenda, especially given the large market opening in LAC to increase broadband connectivity and advance digitalization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States may not be able to compete outright with 5G infrastructure (given the absence of a U.S. company in this arena), it can leverage multilateral engagement and infrastructure investment through PGII in digital connectivity to provide alternative ICT development funding. Through a capital increase at the IDB, the United States can work with other countries to emphasize digital transformation and ICT development throughout the region and increase the institution’s focus on ICT. Moreover, the United States has pledged significant funding through PGII to develop, expand, and deploy secure ICT networks and infrastructure, which includes working with trusted vendors to provide 5G and even 6G technologies. Providing funding for digital infrastructure development in the region will be crucial as an alternative to allowing Huawei to continue to expand its market share. A larger U.S. presence in the ICT sector within LAC can help shape one of the critical industries of the future in line with transparent and democratic traditions that allow for a level playing field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-leverage-partnerships-on-mining-and-critical-minerals&quot;&gt;2. Leverage partnerships on mining and critical minerals.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical minerals are essential to meeting the demands of the clean energy transition, as they will play a large role in decarbonization efforts, including the electrification of vehicles and energy storage technologies. As a region, LAC will be a crucial player in this industry as large reserves of lithium, copper, and nickel—among other critical minerals—are found in large quantities in several countries in the region. Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and the rest of the Americas possess over 70 percent of the globe’s lithium reserves. Moreover, Chile, Peru, and Mexico hold approximately 40 percent of the globe’s copper reserves. On its own, Brazil also hosts 17 percent of the world’s nickel reserves. Critical minerals will be one of the economically impactful industries of the future as the world decarbonizes, and given Latin America’s natural resource endowment, it will be at the center of this industry. While China has approached this industry strategically for the last decade, it by no means has a chokehold over the entire mining space. As it stands, the demand for critical minerals will outpace supply, which gives the United States ample opportunity to increase its competitiveness in this sector through partnerships with countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be more competitive in the critical mineral industry, the U.S. private sector needs to be involved in the early stages of mining and extraction as well as the processing of critical minerals for their downstream end uses. The U.S. government can help to create enabling conditions and de-risking investments so that the private sector can become more involved. This might include financial policies, such as federal grants from the Department of Energy for critical mineral projects in LAC, tax credits for new technologies to increase the productivity of mining processes, and increased loan guarantees and project finance opportunities. The United States can also support greater competitiveness in the critical mineral industry through diplomatic policies, such as by leveraging the Department of State’s Energy Resource Governance Initiative (ERGI) to create regional critical mineral partnerships, expand geological partnerships, improve knowledge-sharing with the private sector on projects in the region, and negotiate trade provisions with regional partners that might increase critical minerals trade. Greater U.S. participation—both in the private sector and from the U.S. government—will help shape the critical mineral industry in LAC to ensure that transparency and standards are in place across the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;3-accelerate-renewable-energy-potential&quot;&gt;3. Accelerate renewable energy potential.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAC and the United States also share a strong policy priority in increasing renewable energy investment. The United States’ commitment to renewable energy, stronger than China’s, presents an opportunity for increasing collaboration and economic ties with LAC. As recently as 2019, the region launched the Renewable Energy for Latin America and the Caribbean Initiative (RELAC), with the objective of achieving 70 percent renewable energy participation in the region’s electricity matrix by 2030. RELAC brings the IDB and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) together to support the region’s renewable energy transition. Renewable energy will be a crucial sector for LAC as countries seek to bolster their economic development, increase climate resilience, and further their decarbonization efforts. In addition to opportunities in wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal sources of energy, LAC also has the potential to be a large player in green hydrogen. Chile is set to be one of the world’s largest exporters of the green hydrogen that will drive much of the clean energy transition in the years to come. By tying the energy transition to climate priorities, the United States has an opportunity to partner with countries in the region to provide necessary funding and support for increasing economic development and creating a more sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the most promising regions for economic development, the United States should prioritize renewable energy projects in LAC. This will include bringing in resources from the public sector, multilateral organizations, and the private sector, as well as using the influence of the U.S. government to mobilize additional capital and resources into the region. At a high level, the NSC should ensure that LAC becomes a priority under PGII so that funding for climate and energy infrastructure is secured for the region. From the public sector, this will require the DFC to increase financing projects in LAC—such as the $100 million it announced at the Summit of the Americas—that serve to address climate and renewable priorities. Initiatives like the U.S. Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis 2030 (PACC 2030) are a crucial step in allocating additional resources to energy security in the region. The United States could consider becoming more involved in RELAC to further support renewable energy efforts. In addition to increasing public sector resources, the State and Treasury Departments should work together to increase access to financing from the IDB and provide incentives for U.S. businesses to make crucial investments in renewable energy. Wherever possible, the United States should tie energy investment to the modernization of regulatory structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;4-strengthen-healthcare-systems-in-the-post-covid-19-environment&quot;&gt;4. Strengthen healthcare systems in the post-Covid-19 environment.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 2.7 million deaths since the beginning of the pandemic, the LAC region has accounted for over 40 percent of global deaths related to Covid-19. Given the extent of the Covid-19 crisis and China’s increasing use of “vaccine diplomacy” as a method for expanding its influence in the region, healthcare and vaccine development represent another area in which the United States could offer an alternative so that China cannot use vaccines as a bargaining chip, as it did in Brazil, to extract strategic concessions. As such, the United States should provide increased resources and partner with countries in LAC to help develop better healthcare systems to aid in the region’s recovery from Covid-19 and prepare for future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration announced action in healthcare for LAC in June 2022, which included initiatives like the Americas Health Corps to provide training to over 500,000 public health professionals across the region as well as expanding USAID’s global health security programs to more countries. These announcements are critical steps to providing increased support to regional partners, and the United States should deliver on these promises—both to increase resilience and, more importantly in the long term, to strengthen LAC’s trust in its ally to the north. Increasing collaboration on healthcare systems and strengthening the region’s preparation for future pandemics will help shape a stronger partnership between the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this bucket, greater partnership must include vaccine development. Production and continuous research on vaccines is a national priority in many countries throughout LAC, as well as a regional priority. Vaccine development can create jobs, promote the sharing of technology, and improve healthcare services. Most importantly, the region is full of strong potential partner institutions owing to its years of research in tropical medicine and emerging diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-grand-strategy&quot;&gt;Toward a Grand Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western Hemisphere will be crucial to U.S. grand strategy in an era of great power competition. It is imperative for U.S. policymakers to have a better understanding of the adverse impacts of Chinese engagement in LAC so that U.S. efforts to safeguard democracy can be incisive and effective. Taking steps to work with regional partners on insulation mechanisms that increase transparency and strengthen democratic institutions will be critical to protecting the democratic traditions of the region in the long term. These actions will further reduce the asymmetries of the China-LAC relationship and allow countries in the region to engage on more equal terms. While most of China’s engagement will likely continue, it will become less and less corrosive to democracy over time. The U.S. government will also need to increase its ability to curtail certain aspects of that engagement, such as the expansion of untrusted ICT vendors in the region. Finally, a critical part of a new U.S. grand strategy will be better prioritizing existing federal funds toward economic, diplomatic, and security initiatives to compete with China and offer credible alternatives that are democracy-preserving in key industries of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the strategy of “insulate, curtail, compete” is about helping LAC to assert greater policy autonomy, reduce dependency and foreign influence, and to make better choices about the region’s long-term strategic interests. Effectively selling the region on those choices will be a key challenge and require diplomatic finesse to understand that various subregions of LAC may desire different combinations of insulation, curtailment, and competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has long been a partner and ally for countries in LAC. Communication and partnership will be of the utmost importance for a grand strategy built for an era of renewed geopolitical competition, and aiming to protect LAC’s democratic traditions should be a top U.S. priority. Moving beyond the United States’ national security interests to show allies that the United States has an interest in LAC’s economic development can demonstrate to the region that its long-standing partner will continue to be a pillar and source of democratic stability for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（10日）踏入審訊第56天。施德來昨快測陽性，獲安排於延伸庭就坐，其代表大律師黃廷光今指施昨晚確診，獲批4天病假，他今有到庭，惟望押後一天審訊作休息，獲法官批准，辯方指施的事務律師同樣呈陽性。法官關注審訊進度，指控方案情似乎將完結。控方確認已傳召所有主要證人，並將應何桂藍和陳志全要求傳召一名選舉主任，及約10名與證物鏈相關的警察證人，另傳召兩至三名證人讓辯方盤問，法官着控辯雙方善用時間商討能否減省證人數量。傍晚司法機構網頁顯示，案件明天未安排審訊，將繼續休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來確診獲批4天病假-申押後一天審訊&quot;&gt;施德來確診獲批4天病假 申押後一天審訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來昨早快速測試陽性，獲安排與事務律師到一號延伸庭就坐。代表施的大律師黃廷光今甫開庭便表示，施昨晚求診後確診新冠肺炎，獲批出4天病假。施今晨仍有到庭，惟希望押後一天審訊，以好好休息和康復。他知道情況不理想，會交由法庭決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪表示，控方打算應何桂藍和陳志全要求傳召時任新界東選舉主任楊蕙心（Amy Yeung），其證供亦只與兩名被告有關。惟法官李運騰指，問題是他們能否在被告的缺席下繼續審訊，形容是困難的決定，又指在非常例外的情況才能這樣做，這亦不安全。法官陳慶偉指，只是一天的押後，他們亦沒有什麼選擇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指將傳召約10名證物鏈相關證人-官着雙方善用今天時間商討&quot;&gt;控方指將傳召約10名證物鏈相關證人 官着雙方善用今天時間商討&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續關注案件進度，指似乎控方案情將要完結。萬德豪指，在楊蕙心後尚會傳召多10至11名與何桂藍及吳政亨的證物鏈有關的警察證人，指是有關尚未納入同意事實的證物，此後尚會傳召兩至三名證人讓辯方盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 表示，預計該些證人所需時間非常短，他亦只關注檢取證物的過程，而非之後如何處理證物。李運騰問是否需要10個或以上證人，Beel 指會於早上與控方商討，李着雙方善用今天的時間，Beel 表示明白，指主要關注戴耀廷的證物及從被告檢取的證物，而非移送證物的過程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，控方是否已傳召本案所有主要證人，萬德豪確認。李續指，辯方是時候要與當事人商討是否要傳召證人或作供，又重申他對案件的進度有點關注。Beel 指知道控方就 Facebook 和 YouTube 等有專家證人，萬回應控方不打算傳召專家證人。李再指，辯方亦要就是否提出無須答辯索指示，Beel 補充指還有「共謀者原則」的陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉最後指，批准案件押後至明天早上，並向黃廷光指，若施德來明天仍不適，需於日內告知法庭。黃表示，施的事務律師昨晚亦呈陽性，李運騰即說「那你一定要保重（“Then you must take care.”）」。審訊約10分鐘結束，散庭時坐在後排的大律師沈士文笑着拿出消毒噴霧四周噴了數下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;傍晚司法機構網頁顯示，案件明天未安排審訊，將繼續休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

（週四 2023-05-11）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪受審，自周三（10日）起因有被告不適而押後。繼施德來周二（9日）晚確診新冠病毒，法官昨（10日）批准押後審訊；同案獲保釋被告黃碧雲今（11日）表示收到法庭通知，另一被告彭卓棋今亦確診，案件明繼續休庭，暫押至下周一（15日）續審。控方早前確認，本案主要證人已作供完畢，將應辯方要求傳召選舉主任及證物鏈相關警員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃碧雲今午（11日）約5時於 Facebook 發文表示，剛收到法庭通知，除施德來外，彭卓棋今亦確診，法庭宣佈星期五（12日）休庭。黃指，法庭內有百多人，空氣不流通，容易令疾病傳開，望能改善庭內換氣和通風系統。據記者觀察，彭卓棋開審以來均坐在施德來的旁邊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來周二（9日）早上新冠病毒快測陽性，原獲安排坐被告欄一角，與其他被告相隔，開庭後獲安排於延伸庭就坐，各被告亦有配戴口罩。其代表大律師黃廷光周三（10日）指施於周二晚求醫並確診新冠病毒，獲批4天病假，向法官申請押後審訊一天獲批，施的事務律師亦確診。法官着施若仍感不適，需及時通知法庭，案件今繼續休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）踏入審訊第55天。控方匿名證人「X先生」今在屏風後作供，表示曾與戴耀廷討論「35+計劃」目的，戴私下及公開均曾提及望迫特首下台。X並指，於2020年5月8日獲邀出席新界西協調會議，過程中以器材錄音及錄影，並於《國安法》實施後的同年9、10月匿名將檔案寄給警方。被問是否公開錄音，X答「係」，但指他將錄音筆放在袋裏，不清楚與會者是否知情，又指「現場係冇人提過係唔畀錄音呢樣嘢」；至於錄影，他指自己「全程都（將攝影器材）攞喺手度，有擺枱面，之後都有周圍影」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問為何錄音錄影，X否認是為了向警方舉報，並指因戴耀廷曾提及望以「35+」推翻政府，故望「了解吓」、「記錄返畀自己睇吓」、用作「研究」，指是直至《國安法》立法後才決定將檔案交予警方；而他匿名舉報，是想幫警方調查，但「唔想自己身分曝光咁麻煩」。庭上播放X拍攝的片段，戴曾稱新界東共同綱領字眼是「會運用」否決權，認為新界西可採用相同字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來確診獲安排於無人法庭就坐-官稱除寂寞外不會造成不公&quot;&gt;施德來確診獲安排於無人法庭就坐 官稱除「寂寞」外不會造成不公&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案認罪被告、時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟昨完成作供，控方為下一名證人申請匿名令獲批，該名證人以「X先生」稱呼，獲准在屏風後作供及循特別通道出入法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，代表施德來的大律師黃廷光便表示，施今早快速測試陽性，他已預約今晚看醫生，並獲安排坐在被告欄最左一側，與其他被告相隔，暫不會申請押後。所有被告今均配戴口罩，林卓廷入庭後除下口罩，撓手聳肩。法官陳慶偉提議，施德來可與律師到無人的一號延伸庭就坐，陳仲衡亦指除了寂寞外他的當事人不會蒙受不公，林卓廷笑着重複「loneliness，loneliness」。法庭其後小休讓施轉往另一法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x先生稱戴2019年區選後不同場合提35目的令特首下台&quot;&gt;「X先生」稱戴2019年區選後不同場合提「35+」目的令特首下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後傳召「X先生」作供，X於開庭前已到場，被屏風包圍，鄒家成一度問：「吓，喺度㗎啦？」，又雙手作望遠鏡狀。X同意，他沒有政治聯繫，而他早於2020年5月前已認識戴耀廷，並曾與戴討論「35+計劃」的目的，指戴在不同公開場合或私下均向他表示望得到立法會過半後否決財政預算案兩次，癱瘓政府和迫特首下台。X指，不記得戴第一次提及的確實時間，但有印象戴在2019年11月區選後「好有信心」並常提及，並在法官追問下指應是在2019年聖誕和2020年農曆新年之間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於是什麼場合首次提及，X先生指「都係啲飯局嚟嘅，喺唔同嘅飯局，唔同嘅人，基本上都係啲泛民」。他指不記得誰安排飯局，而飯局上主要邀請「嗰啲泛民嗰啲人士」，戴耀廷經常分享「35+」的概念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x於新西會議錄音錄影-2020年910月匿名將檔案寄警方&quot;&gt;X於新西會議錄音錄影 2020年9、10月匿名將檔案寄警方&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X供稱，獲人民力量梁家聲邀請出席2020年5月8日的新界西協調會議，他約於2017、18年認識梁，記得梁提過有興趣參加新界西選舉。X指，他和梁當日出席會議，他有留到最後，期間分別用一支錄音筆和「一個細細個嘅攝錄器材」進行錄音和錄影，並在法官追問下指該器材並非電話，但大小與電話差不多，並可將檔案「直接過返電腦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X指，當晚有打開聲音和影片檔案，並在《國安法》實行之後的同年9、10月匿名向警方報案，並將檔案燒成一隻光碟寄給警方，包括2段錄音檔案和11段影片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x稱公開錄音惟不知其他人是否知悉-被告席爆笑&quot;&gt;X稱「公開錄音」惟不知其他人是否知悉 被告席爆笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X供稱，會議於元朗世宙地下的一個區議員辦事處舉行，有數十人出席，辦事處約有三分一個法庭大，有桌子放中間，與會者圍着桌子隨便坐，「我入到去都係隨便搵個位坐。」被問他是否坐近桌子，X指「算係近啦，可以擺到（錄影機）嘅」，控方再問他是否將攝影機放在桌子，X答「有時有，有時揸喺手」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰關注，需否知道片段是公開抑或隱蔽攝錄，羅天瑋指重點應在片段的內容，但李指「我想知道，你會問嗎？」，羅續指他會就此跟進，並問X錄音是否公開進行，X答「係」。李運騰問，因此所有與會者都知道他進行錄音？X指「我就唔知係咪佢哋知道，我就咁擺喺個袋度」，被告席隨即爆發笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/T9xd4UM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 署理助理刑事檢控專員（特別職務） 羅天瑋（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，那X是否公開錄音，指「公開」的意思是他沒有嘗試隱瞞錄音的行為，他讓其他人知道他在做記錄，X回應「我記得現場係冇人提過係唔畀錄音呢樣嘢」。李再問，那其他人知道X當時在錄音嗎？X答：「我唔清楚」，林卓廷大聲冷笑。法官陳仲衡問那他有沒有告訴其他人？X答「冇」。李運騰再問，那其他與會者知道他在錄影嗎？X答：「我就唔知佢哋知唔知，不過我全程都攞喺手度、有擺枱面，之後都有周圍影嘅」，林卓廷和鄒家成等發笑，鄒一度舉起雙手模仿攝影機。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x認選擇不同器材錄音錄影是經深思熟慮&quot;&gt;X認選擇不同器材錄音錄影是經深思熟慮&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，X為何要分別錄音和錄影，為何不只用手機拍攝有聲效的影片。X指因手機若收到訊息有機會暫停錄影，「同埋我唔想將敏感嘅資訊放喺我個人手機。」李問，因此X分開兩個儀器，是刻意（deliberate and conscious）的選擇，他是經過深思熟慮（thought it through）？X答：「係，當時我買嗰兩樣嘢就係為咗清楚睇返，有影像同聲音加深我嘅了解同記憶。」X同意，拍攝的片段也有聲音，李指那他也不需要另外錄音？惟X指「大家都知有時錄影同錄音嘅效果係唔同，錄音筆係會清晰好多」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x不同意記錄為報案-指只用來研究了解戴耀廷稱搞35想推翻政府&quot;&gt;X不同意記錄為報案 指只用來研究、了解戴耀廷稱搞35+想「推翻政府」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，控方尚未問X為何進行錄音錄影，指若他不發問，相信辯方也會問。羅天瑋指將會問到，並問X為何錄音錄影。X解釋，因戴在5月8日前於不同場合向他提過望以「35+」推翻政府，而梁家聲（人民力量成員）於5月初邀請他出席會議，「咁我覺得：如果直程討論35+嗰個會，係咪有機會可以做個記錄？所以我就去買咗攝錄器材，等自己有機會記錄返比自己睇吓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，他想透過該些記錄做什麼？X答：「因為了解吓佢提過話搞呢個35+就想推翻政府啊嘛。」李運騰問，所以他出席會議並進行記錄的目的，是為了之後可以以他們來向警方報案？X指只同意前半的描述：「我係自己愛嚟研究，但唔認同係諗住嚟畀警方嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x稱匿名舉報因想幫警方調查-惟不想身分曝光&quot;&gt;X稱匿名舉報因想幫警方調查 惟不想身分曝光&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋續問，戴此前就「35+」目的的描述，哪部分引起他的關注？X指，戴稱要控制初選人數入立法會，並可透過控制立法會，否決財政預算案，迫特首下台，「咁我就覺得應該就好有問題囉，就唔係為社區做嘢囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，《國安法》於2020年7月1日才生效，而X自5月已有該些記錄，更曾出席會議知道與會者的發言，但他直至9、10月才向警方報案，為什麼？X指因他是在《國安法》立法後，才決定將檔案寄給警方。羅續問，X為何選擇匿名舉報，X指：「因為呢段嘢畀警方係想幫警方調查，唔想自己身分曝光咁麻煩。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方播新西片段鏡動晃動置枱底-戴耀廷提議新西協議跟隨新東用會運用&quot;&gt;控方播新西片段鏡動晃動置枱底 戴耀廷提議新西協議跟隨新東用「會運用」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，X拍攝的片段全長兩小時，但不會全部於庭上播放，只會播放其中6分鐘的片段，並展示錄音謄本予X確認，惟法官李運騰一度要求關閉螢幕，指顯示了證人的名字，被告席傳出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放數段片段，戴提及已完成了四區的協調，只餘下新西和超級區議會，並指各區除「五大訴求，缺一不可」外，共同綱領亦有「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權，其中除新東用「會運用」，其他區都用「會積極運用」。庭上可見攝錄鏡頭不斷晃動，一時置於枱底，一時拍天花板，亦曾傾斜和反轉。X認出片中的戴耀廷和黃偉賢，二人均坐在拍片者的對面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;片段又顯示，戴提議新界西文件「就用返新界東嗰個字眼，改動最少㗎嘞，就只係剔除咗『積極』兩個字啫，就係『會運用』咁樣」，即明確意向是「會運用」，「我哋就簡簡單單就表達咗我哋立場。」他又提及否決財政預算案是令解散立法會出現「最緊要」一步，「如果否決財政預算案呢，我哋先至會行到去下一步」，望協議能訂明「會運用《基本法》賦予立法會的權力」否決財政預算案達到「五大訴求」，以爭取「特赦、懲戒警暴同埋重啟政改」。播放片段時，鄒家成一度雙手掩面，搖頭苦笑。控方其後表示已完成主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/82atf5H.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）踏入審訊第55天。供稱於新西協調會議錄音和錄影、《國安法》生效後交予警方的控方匿名證人「X先生」接受辯方盤問，同意沒有問准與會者便進行拍攝，但不覺得是侵犯他人私隱，自言「我就冇話唔想畀人知」、亦「唔係所謂秘密（拍攝）」，指當時「我係好光明正大咁揸住部機周圍影」。被問是否民主派支持者，X指「我有時支持、有時唔支持，我點答呢咁？」，並承認初選舉行數年前，曾任建制派政黨的議員助理，但否認有第三方要求他錄影新西會議、亦否認提供資料有收取報酬，強調記錄是「純粹諗住畀我自己去了解」戴耀廷的計劃有否違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X又同意，於2021年4月和5月錄取的首兩份供詞均「唔敢講、唔敢認」自己是攝錄並交新西會議片段予警方的人，但因今年年初知悉身分曝光，遂於本年2月底錄取口供時告知警方。被問未來會否因此獲得報償，X稱：「政府會唔會畀個好市民獎我，我唔知喎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;稱戴耀廷提及推翻政府-x盤問下指是對戴說法的理解&quot;&gt;稱戴耀廷提及「推翻政府」 X盤問下指是對戴說法的理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方匿名證人「X先生」今早供稱，獲人民力量梁家聲邀請出席新西協調會議，期間進行錄音及錄影，並於2020年9、10月匿名將檔案交給警方，解釋望記錄作「研究」。X完成主問後，接受代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸盤問，同意他並非「35+計劃」的組織者和參與者，而他稱戴曾在不同場合提及「35+」目的時，並不記得趙家賢、區諾軒和鍾錦麟在場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HNPhlwe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄭達鴻（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X在主問供稱，戴耀廷在5月8日前向他提過望以「35+」推翻政府。代表何啟明的大律師阮偉明指，X在2021年4月29日和5月4日的第一和第二份供詞均沒有如此提及，X指「如果你話口供有寫嘅字眼，可能當時冇提到啦」。阮續指，戴其實沒有提過「推翻政府」，X回應，戴在「咁多次傾偈」均提到迫特首下台，「我嘅理解就係覺得迫特首落台就係推翻政府。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WPXv4DG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x同意首兩次錄口供沒告知警方&quot;&gt;X同意首兩次錄口供沒告知警方&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後由代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文盤問。X同意，兩次供詞都是警方主動聯絡他錄取，他願向警方講述事件，但沒告知警方他曾寄出新西會議的錄音和片段。沈續指，第二次錄口供時，警方曾向X播放該兩段錄音及11段片段，播畢後X沒告知警方自己就是攝錄者，並稱相信片段是有關他有出席的5月8日會議情況，而錄音令他記起會上情況也反映會上內容。X確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x同意片段晃動-解釋我唔係一個專業嘅攝錄人士&quot;&gt;X同意片段晃動 解釋「我唔係一個專業嘅攝錄人士」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X同意，片段顯示兩名主持戴耀廷和時任元朗區議會主席黃偉賢均坐在一張枱前，與會者則在枱對面，而片段有時拍天花板、有時拍枱底，而且「郁來郁去（shaky）」。沈續指，片段亦「非常不穩定」，X答「我唔知係咪穩定，因為我係揸住喺手度，我當時冇話特意影邊個或者點樣影，純粹諗住做個記錄」，其後同意片段大部分時間鏡頭也晃動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，X稱望拍片以進行「研究」，他不想片段穩定地拍攝嗎？X答：「我係想希望（穩定），但我唔係一個專業嘅攝錄人士」。李運騰問，X是否不想其他人知道他在錄影？X答：「我就冇話唔想畀人知，當時我攞住部機機，我覺得都算係相對大方啦，就周圍影，擺枱面。」林卓廷面露驚訝，張開嘴巴發出「吓」聲，鄒家成等亦發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x同意沒問准拍攝-官問是否不想人知-x自言相對大方&quot;&gt;X同意沒問准拍攝 官問是否不想人知 X自言「相對大方」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈再問X是否想片段穩定，X指沒留意是否穩定，僅指他將攝錄器材「揸住喺手度」。沈指當然知道，第三度問他是否想片段穩定？X再答：「我當然係希望想穩定啦，但我冇咁嘅技術去做啊嘛。」沈續問，整個會議期間，X是否沒問組織者或與會者的准許拍攝他們，X指「當時我冇問過，但現場都冇人講呢個唔可以拍攝，現場都有好多人攞住部電話周圍」。李運騰着他直接回答問題，X續答「冇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x稱錄影後重複看兩三次了解戴耀廷有否違法-上網找尋法律但搵唔到&quot;&gt;X稱錄影後重複看兩三次了解戴耀廷有否違法 上網找尋法律但「搵唔到」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就X稱記錄會議內容是為了「研究」，沈士文問，那自5月8日會議至他於9、10月將檔案交警方前，他為這個「研究」做了什麼？X指「我有重複聽同埋睇嗰啲片同錄音啦」，指「應該起碼睇過兩三次」。李運騰問X指的「研究」是什麼意思，X指戴當時提及否決預算案迫特首落台，故想「了解清楚佢（戴耀廷）咁樣做會唔會有問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，除了重複聽和看錄音和錄影，X還做了什麼去了解，X指他並非法律人士，「我就想了解例如睇吓啲法律呀，搵吓啲唔識嘅嘢」，並指當時有政府人士稱初選或違法，他覺得可能真的有問題，加上《國安法》通過，就決定將片段寄出。李指X只是逃避問題、重複所說的話，又指問題簡單，就是X還做了什麼「研究」。X重申有上網找尋相關法律，「但係就唔識呢啲嘢，就搵唔到。」李續向沈指，根據證人回答的方式，不認為能繼續問到什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X續同意，他沒有修讀過政治或法律的課程。沈問，那當他稱為了「研究」而記錄會議時，他是要進行任何有關香港政治狀況的研究嗎？X答：「冇，純粹諗住畀我自己去了解吓啫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;供詞稱2020年初買器材望日後研究-x否認當時未知新西會議日期&quot;&gt;供詞稱2020年初買器材望日後研究 X否認當時未知新西會議日期&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X在盤問下同意，戴耀廷2019年尾至2020年初首次向他提及「35+」時，他已懷疑可能違法。沈問因此在2020年初，他已購買錄音和錄影的器材？X指「應該就唔係」。沈續展示X於2023年2月21日，即案件開審後第三周所錄取的第3份供詞，交代涉案的11段片段及兩段錄音均是由他在5月8日新西會議拍攝及錄音，並指2020年初得知戴望透過民主派初選，在立法會否決財政預算案，最終令特首下台，「所以當時我懷疑今次民主派初選係可能會觸犯法例，於是我就喺2020年初就買咗一啲錄影錄音嘅器材，希望第日有機會錄低有關搞初選嘅嘢嚟畀自己研究。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈問，X是指自己於2020年初買器材？X答「可以咁講」，並在法官追問下指肯定是在5月會議之前，但確實日期不記得。沈問，X買器材時是否尚未定下新西會議日期，惟X指當時已知道，並由梁家聲邀請出席。沈指若事實如此，則他會向警方表明他是為了記錄新西會議而買器材。X解釋當時這樣說是因為就當天會議，「可以有機會去，可以有機會唔去」，不同意辯方指他買器材時並不知道將有新西會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，X是指當他懷疑「35+」犯法、並希望記錄作研究時，梁家聲「純粹巧合（pure coincidence）」地邀請他出席新西會議？X答：「係」，並指對被邀請「冇話高唔高興」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x稱沒告知梁家聲攝錄會議-因不了解初選有否違法&quot;&gt;X稱沒告知梁家聲攝錄會議 因不了解初選有否違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續問，X打算攝錄會議作「研究」，有否告訴他的「朋友」梁家聲，X指：「唔認為需要，點解要同佢講？」李運騰問，他不擔心梁無意中參與有問題的討論？X指他認為可能有問題，但不是完全了解。李續問事實上梁是否X的朋友，X指與梁在2017、2018年在地區認識，平時地區活動有交流，可說是「認識嘅人（acquaintance）」，平時「有出嚟食吓飯傾吓偈」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡指，問題其實是以X與梁的關係，他會否就懷疑犯法的事警告梁？X重申因為不肯定有否犯法，故沒有告訴他。沈最後再問X當時是否視梁為朋友，李運騰補充朋友的意思是他會關心的人，X說：「咁呀……只可以話唔算囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問梁邀請X出席時，是否知道X無興趣參選，X表示「我由頭到尾都冇講話我有興趣，係佢話佢有興趣，邀請我跟去聽吓」，而他會前已估計和懷疑計劃違法。沈再次問，即使如此，他也沒告知梁他認為初選可能違法？X指「咁我都唔會將我懷疑、都唔確定嘅嘢同人講㗎嘛」，並在法官追問下答「冇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x指有時支持有時唔支持民主派-曾任建制派議員議助&quot;&gt;X指「有時支持、有時唔支持」民主派 曾任建制派議員議助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈其後問到X的政治立場，問他在新西會議舉行時是否視自己為泛民主派的支持者。X指「我唔認為我係支持有任何派別嘅」，因他從無參與任何政黨，並在沈追問下指，「如果一定話係咪支持民主派，咁我有時支持、有時唔支持，我點答呢咁？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，有趣的是他有出席一些泛民人士的飯局，問他是否也有出席建制派飯局，X指「基本上我唔會話特別係支持泛民或者建制」，只是想做地區工作，鄒家成、余慧明等發笑。沈其後問及X此前的工作背景，陳慶偉質疑不相關和不重要，沈指他是在建立案情。X其後同意，於案發數年前曾任建制派政黨的議員助理一段時間，並自行辭職，認識建制派之餘也「識到好多你所謂嘅『民主派』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈欲繼續就相關背景發問，惟陳慶偉質疑與案無關。沈重申欲質疑證人可信性，指其政治聯繫會影響他供稱錄影新西會議原因的可信性，又指X不僅將所拍攝的片段呈堂，亦有就戴耀廷的說法作供，故就此發問。惟陳慶偉指，除了指戴提過「推翻政府」外，X其他有關戴的證供，法庭已有其他證據；李運騰亦指，他理解X的角色只是協助將證物呈堂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x稱不覺得未經批准錄影是侵犯他人私隱&quot;&gt;X稱不覺得未經批准錄影是侵犯他人私隱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文在休庭後，表示已完成盤問。代表施德來的大律師黃廷光續問，X是否認為沒有得到他人許可下錄影是侵犯他們的私隱？X答：「唔覺得。」黃再向X指出，他錄影是為了「研究」以外的目的，惟法官指已問過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x否認有第三方要求攝錄新西會議指器材去年已壞咗抌咗&quot;&gt;X否認有第三方要求攝錄新西會議、指器材去年已「壞咗，抌咗」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後到代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。被問與戴耀廷曾出席多少次飯局，X指不確定，大概約數個，約一至兩個月舉行一次，「主要都係傾吓分享吓當時嗰個政治」，但他沒被要求分享。Beel 問那他為何在場？X指「咁有啲朋友邀請我去」，但不記得是誰，也不記得除戴耀廷以外出席的人士，僅稱「主要係圍繞住一啲泛民主派嘅人士」。Beel 問，這些飯局是否只是他的幻想？X答：「點解要幻想，呢個係事實嚟㗎喎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2021年4月的首份口供，被問是什麼情況下錄取，X指是「警方突然上我屋企」，指「有單案件需要我協助調查」，而警方事前沒聯絡他。Beel 續問，是否有第三方要求他攝錄新西會議？X指沒有，同意他是自主行事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 又問及該兩個攝錄器材現時去向，X指「壞咗，抌咗」，余慧明驚訝做口型「嘩」。X在追問下指於2022年丟棄，不記得確實日子，又指曾於一些活動用過，「就覺得係有問題、唔用得，所以就抌咗。」Beel 問為何想記錄活動，X指「既然我買咗個筆就無謂嘥咗」，林卓廷大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x稱相信第二次會議內容差不多-故沒有再攝錄&quot;&gt;X稱相信第二次會議內容差不多 故沒有再攝錄&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，X有出席新界西5月於旺角的第二次會議，X先指不太記得、但肯定沒有，後在法官追問下又指印象中5月8日後有出席另一個會議，內容大概都與初選有關，「但確實係咪新界西，我就唔肯定啦，因為冇記錄」，林卓廷說「吓」。Beel 指，X口供曾提及該次會議與會者與5月8日差不多，但多了區諾軒，X指「嗰陣時份口供可能係咁寫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，該會議與初選有關，X當時是否有興趣繼續做他的「研究」？X指當時錄了第一次，「之後睇返個畫面係好唔穩定，自己都頭暈，講真」，李指那無阻他錄音，X指「咁既然第一次錄咗，我相信內容都差唔多」，故沒有錄多次，同意沒有錄第二次是他自主的決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x稱檢視片段後認為戴有機會違法-仍出席第二次會議因諗住聽清楚&quot;&gt;X稱檢視片段後認為戴有機會違法 仍出席第二次會議因「諗住聽清楚」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就X的攝錄器材，他同意沒有螢幕，需傳送到電腦才能觀看。Beel 問是否不像相機，X答：「我覺得似啦，因為有鏡頭、有開關，點解唔似呢？」，並指是如手機的大小。Beel 問，該攝錄機是否偽裝（disguise）成其他東西的間諜器材，惟李運騰質疑是否需要。Beel 續問，X當時買了兩個器材分別錄音和錄影，是否想在其中一個不能用時，還有另一個備份。X重申錄音筆效果比錄影好，而購買時售貨員亦指錄音筆的錄音效果較好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問首次會議是否知道正錄取敏感的資料，並相信有罪行將發生，X指「我都講咗我係懷疑囉」，「我唔係一個法律專業人士，我都係估計啫」，並確認會議翌日曾檢視錄取內容。被問當時是否認為有刑事成分，他指「我都係唔了解、唔認識，所以先諗住睇多幾次、聽多幾次了解吓」，而檢視過後，就覺得「可能佢（戴耀廷）咁搞就有機會違反法律」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問既然如此，為何仍出席第二次會議？X重申當時懷疑犯法，故「諗住聽清楚」，而第二次會後「結論都係懷疑、估計（犯法）」。Beel 問既然有此懷疑，為何不立即將檔案發給警方，X指因戴耀廷指自己是「法律專家」，當時指不會違法；而他其後再發給警方，是因《國安法》通過，「有好多啲官話呢樣嘢係違法呀嘛。」Beel 問是什麼違法，X答：「初選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;x指今年年初被曝光才告知警方他是攝錄者稱光明正大揸住部機周圍影&quot;&gt;X指今年年初被曝光才告知警方他是攝錄者、稱「光明正大揸住部機周圍影」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，X向警方報案時是否知道警方正進行調查，X指他不知道，「不過我估佢應該有（調查）啩，見通過咗個法律。」X同意，在首兩次錄口供時他都「唔敢講、唔敢認」他是拍攝並向警方發送片段的人，他是在今年年初，「我上網見到我畀人曝光出嚟」，才告知警方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，X是秘密地攝錄會議，不想被其他人得知，X答：「頭先我都講過我唔係所謂秘密，我係好光明正大咁揸住部機周圍影。」Beel 最後問，X提供資料有否報酬，X指沒有，Beel 追問那他未來會否有報償（reward），傳譯主任譯為「獎項」，X回應：「政府會唔會畀個好市民獎我，我唔知喎」，多名被告發笑。Beel 笑說或者不會，並指沒有盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳政亨、余慧明、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、劉偉聰、陳志全、鄒家成和李予信也沒有盤問，控方沒有覆問。控方最後為X申請證人費，陳仲衡指這並非酬勞，李運騰並解釋任何市民出庭作證人可得到證人費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示，下一名證人是因應何桂藍要求而傳召的選舉主任。案件明早續。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鍾錦麟作供完畢 控方為第四證人申匿名令獲批&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WRgG3KY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（8日）踏入審訊第54天。時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟接受辯方盤問，同意戴耀廷望以「35+」要求政府回應「五大訴求」。被問是否並非無論如何都會「一刀切」無差別否決預算案，鍾表示「為了爭取五大訴求而否決預算案」是「比較貼近實際情況」。鍾亦指，估計民主派較難取得「35+」，指2019年區議會民主派大勝純粹因為單議席單票制，難以簡單推斷2020年立法會選舉也能大勝，自言「我個人睇得保守啲」。法官指這只是鍾的看法，而非戴耀廷看法，鍾形容「佢（戴耀廷）係超級大好友」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，鍾上周稱何桂藍於新東會議自介為「立場姐姐」，何兩度大叫「肯定冇」。鍾今再解釋當時戴耀廷介紹何為「立場姐姐」，何語帶無奈表示大家叫她做「立場姐姐」。在被告席的何擺手和做口型示意她沒有。鍾錦麟今作供完畢，法官批准控方為下一名控方證人申請匿名令，他將以「X先生」稱呼，並獲准在屏風後作供及以特別通道出入法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱民動2月已有共識協助初選眾籌趙家贀退出前不曾提原因&quot;&gt;鍾稱民動2月已有共識協助初選眾籌、趙家贀退出前不曾提原因&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟繼續接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。鍾同意，於2020年2月與戴耀廷的會面，戴提及民主動力有銀行戶口可協助籌款。被問民動是否於同年5月才正式承辦眾籌，鍾指在2月的會面上已有共識民動可在這方面協助。鍾又同意，趙家賢在6月9日初選記者會後曾表示眾籌進度不理想，找職員草擬 Facebook 帖文宣傳，亦着鍾幫忙轉發，但鍾不清楚帖文由誰所撰，發文前亦沒有細看，「見到入面有關於眾籌嘅詳情我就轉發咗啦」，趙亦沒提過有審批過帖文。此前趙曾就該帖文出現「光復議會」和「對抗暴政」向法官認錯，指帖文由職員所撰，「我冇做好謹慎責任嘅角色。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦展示民主動力執委會2019年10月的會議紀錄，提及趙家賢匯報因民動及戴耀廷受國務院及港澳辦嚴厲譴責，民動為免繼續被打壓而退出協調工作。法官早前曾質疑趙沒有提到民動被「騎劫」，趙指雖文字紀錄沒有，但有向執委會提及。Beel 問，會議紀錄有關民動退出的原因是否準確，鍾稱「喺正式退出之前，趙家賢冇同我提出過」，故未能評論哪個原因較重要或不重要，只能確定上述理由是趙在初選活動中的「重要關注」。鍾亦不記得趙會上有提及其他退出的原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾同意以往議員反對撥款無後果相信建制媒體報導或影響選舉主任&quot;&gt;鍾同意以往議員反對撥款無後果、相信建制媒體報導或影響選舉主任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟在盤問下同意，以往立法會均有議員對撥款條例草案投反對票。Beel 問反對後有否引起迴響（repercussion）？鍾稱「投完個反應唔大嘅」，因他們並非立法會大多數，即使反對撥款條例草案，「本身就冇特別大去影響到政府運作」；而反應較大是視乎審議有否拉布，最大反應一次則是約於2009至2011年間，撥款條例草案正式表決前，臨時撥款被立法會否決。鍾同意，以往議員反對預算案並沒有問題或後果（ramification）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾上周供稱，新東首次會議後曾向戴表達無差別否決預算案或致DQ。他同意因親建制媒體對戴耀廷文章、初選和否決預算案作批評，而他們的報導反映中央政府看法，故當時有此擔心。Beel 續問，鍾是否相信這些文章會對選舉主任產生影響？控方一度指證人未能回答，但法官指是問及他個人的看法，鍾表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問是否一刀切無差別否決-鍾稱為爭五大訴求否決較貼近實際情況&quot;&gt;被問是否一刀切無差別否決 鍾稱為爭五大訴求否決「較貼近實際情況」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾續同意，「35+計劃」是戴耀廷提出的願景，而戴認為民主派若立會過半，便可向政府就民主派提出的議題包括「五大訴求，缺一不可」施壓。Beel 指五大訴求曾經改變，鍾回應「都喺同一個框架入面」，並同意其中一項訴求是撤回《逃犯條例》，其後已撤回，而特首下台的訴求被爭取雙普選取代。Beel 指，故戴是希望透過「35+」，要求政府回應五大訴求，否則會反對政府議案，尤其是預算案？鍾認同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問，所以當時並非無論如何，都會一刀切無差別否決預算案（not a blanket indiscriminately vote against the budget come what may）？鍾指，「我反而覺得你原先嘅講法，為咗爭取五大訴求而去否決預算案，呢個係比較貼近個實際情況」，又指：「當然我唔能夠講一個平行時空，五大訴求如果得到咩程度嘅回應，而呢個35+選出嚟嘅議員嘅取態又有啲咩唔同，我呢個唔能夠講得到。」陳慶偉問，故是視乎每名初選參與者？鍾指「我只可以講我理解囉」，同意就其他參與者的取態不能回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱對能否獲35較保守-惟指戴耀廷是超級大好友&quot;&gt;鍾稱對能否獲「35+」較保守 惟指戴耀廷是「超級大好友」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，鍾當時認為民主派是否不可能在2020年9月的立法會換屆選舉取得「35+」，鍾稱「我當時嘅估計係較困難」，指因當時大家是基於區議會「單議席單票制」去評估選情，但據他在2019年區選的經驗，當時反對民主派的票數亦創新高。法官李運騰指他不明白，鍾續解釋表面上民主派當年獲「壓倒性勝利」，純粹因為是單議席單票制，但得票率其實沒有大改變，「所以唔能夠好簡單就去下一個結論，當時嘅立法會選舉亦都一樣民主派會大勝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指是因為立法會採取「比例代表制」，鍾同意，並指有功能組別如飲食界，的確在2019年社會事件中生意受到影響，「係咪咁簡單就話2019年嘅選舉結果，就推斷2020年嘅立法會選舉能夠大勝呢？我個人睇得保守啲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，這只是鍾的看法，明顯不是戴耀廷的看法。鍾回應「佢（戴耀廷）係超級大好友」（即指戴對此很樂觀），林卓廷等被告發笑，鍾並指沒有向戴表達過其較保守或悲觀的看法。李運騰問，那新東首次會議上有沒有與會者關注「35+」成功的機會？鍾指沒有，因新界東在2016年立會換屆選舉已取得6席，「喺新界東攞返6席本身就唔係太難嘅」，他擔心的是其他區或功能組別，同意即使地方選區取得23席，功能組別仍需13席才能過半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VZot7fa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾指不知悉初選後有計劃協調民主派行動&quot;&gt;鍾指不知悉初選後有計劃協調民主派行動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，由於功能組別要考慮生意利益，故相信所有功能組別議員都會否決預算案是「不切實際」的？鍾答「我冇考慮過呢個問題」，但認同據其區議會經驗，成員間有很多內鬥（in-house fighting）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，那鍾是否知道當時有沒有計劃或制度在初選之後，會就勝出的參選人作協調，統一他們投票？鍾指過往立法會民主派議員有「飯盒會」，其後正名為「民主派會議」，「但我唔肯定如果2020年嘅立法會選舉都係咁樣去選出一班民主派議員嘅話，呢個飯盒會仲會唔會運作到。」李運騰指不是問以往，而是問有沒有將來的計劃，鍾表示不知悉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱戴耀廷介紹何桂藍為立場姐姐-何語帶無奈指大家叫她做立場姐姐&quot;&gt;鍾稱戴耀廷介紹何桂藍為「立場姐姐」 何語帶無奈指大家叫她做「立場姐姐」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟上周五指何桂藍於4月14日的新東首次會議自我介紹為「立場姐姐」，何兩度大叫「肯定冇！」。Beel 今向鍾指出，鍾可能聽過別人稱她為「立場姐姐」，但何當天會上並沒有這樣介紹自己。此時何背靠牆雙手捧起文件微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾回應：「我嘗試記返當時嘅對話係點樣啦，戴耀廷介紹何桂藍係『立場姐姐』，之後何桂藍稱呼自己做何桂藍，跟住佢語帶無奈話即係大家叫我做『立場姐姐』」，何一度掩面發笑，並擺手搖頭，頻做口型指她並沒有。法官陳仲衡指，此問題無助辯方案情，Beel 表示明白，但指其當事人對此有強烈感受（strong feeling），法官陳慶偉表示明白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱首次新東會議就舉行初選及目標議席61達共識-惟無進行投票&quot;&gt;鍾稱首次新東會議就舉行初選及目標議席「6+1」達共識 惟無進行投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意，首次新東會議就進行初選有共識。Beel 問如何得悉有共識，鍾指經討論後，所有原本提倡「棄選」方案的參與者也接受了「初選」方案，故認為已達成共識，並指戴耀廷應有講過一次「大家係有共識用初選方案」，但不太肯定，而會上並沒有就此進行投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾亦供稱，會上就目標議席達成共識，指隨着決定用初選方案，亦決定會選出多少人去報名參加正式選舉，共識就是「6+1」，但同樣沒進行投票。Beel 問他肯定不是稍後再決定？鍾指「我理解係拍咗板㗎啦」，並指早前稱向戴就新東文件初稿提出異議，正是就「6+1」的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾續指，「如果法庭好關心呢個問題呢，我可以提供多一項資料提供畀法庭去參考嘅」，指初選完結後、正式選舉報名前，新東參選人曾爭拗新東目標議席究竟是6還是7，而最後戴指「6同埋7都唔係正確嘅講法，正確嘅講法係6+1，即係7隊人會去報名，但係最後一隊要係選情要比預期順利先至開展選舉工程」。鍾指，戴是透過 WhatsApp 提及上述說法，而當時新東排第7的是范國威。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱沒印象會上有港獨破壞一國兩制言論&quot;&gt;鍾稱沒印象會上有港獨、破壞一國兩制言論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意，無論共識如何，都是由戴耀廷的想法所帶動（driven by what Benny Tai wanted）；而鍾對DQ的問題較敏感，認為港獨、破壞一國兩制等言論均可能引致DQ，但沒印象會上曾聽過相關發言。Beel 表示已完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後指，知道協調會議達成4項共識，除舉行初選和目標議席數量外，還有替補機制和舉行選舉論壇，問會上是否沒有就此投票。鍾同意，指就替補機制和選舉論壇的共識，「我形容係冇爭議嘅」，並補充會上的確有人對自己能否成功「入閘」較悲觀，但對替補機制無爭議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;會議紀錄顯示柯耀林新東第二次會議當晚正開區議會會議&quot;&gt;會議紀錄顯示柯耀林新東第二次會議當晚正開區議會會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表柯耀林的大律師唐樂山其後就柯出席新東會議的情況發問。鍾上周供稱，因西貢區議會超時而缺席5月5日的新東第二次協調會議，鍾確認柯同屬西貢區議員。辯方展示當天的西貢區議會會議紀錄，顯示鍾於上午9時30分出席，下午10時40分離席，鍾確認；紀錄亦顯示柯耀林於上午9時33分出席，下午10時40分離席，鍾稱沒有獨立記憶，只記得柯有出席會議，但不記得其離席時間和是否有全程出席，但同意不會質疑會議紀錄的真實性。他亦不記得柯耀林有否出席首次新東會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳志全、鄒家成、和李予信均沒有盤問，控方亦沒有覆問。鍾完成作供，離開時一度望向旁聽席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方為證人申請匿名令獲批-指證人擔心遭受網絡欺凌&quot;&gt;控方為證人申請匿名令獲批 指證人擔心遭受網絡欺凌&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早前欲就其中一名控方證人申請匿名令，今表示辯方沒反對，但有部分被告就匿名令範圍提出修訂。代表李予信的大律師關文渭表示，望匿名令不適用於在公共領域（public domain）而非於庭上獲得的資料。法官質疑若批准申請，會有違匿名令想進一步保護證人的原意。關則回應，相關資料在公共領域已存在，不認為法庭能阻止資訊進一步傳播，法庭只能限制庭上的資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，望保護證人被有不可告人動機（ulterior motive）的人騷擾或威嚇；法官李運騰亦指，證人擔心披露他在庭上作供或遭受網絡欺凌，認為法庭要處理其關注，並在公平審訊和保護證人之間取得平衡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉終表示，考慮到關大狀的修訂會令整個匿名令失去保護證人的原意，故拒絕其申請，並批准證人的匿名令，下令各方以「X先生」稱呼他，並禁止任何人包括被告、法律代表和傳媒，披露任何可令公眾識別其身分的資料，如名字、相片、出生日期等；證人獲准在屏風後作供，及經特別通道出入法庭。陳另指任何人若違反命令，有機會犯藐視法庭，可被判監或罰款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據庭上作供次序，「X先生」是繼區諾軒、趙家賢和鍾錦麟後的第四名控方證人。據了解，早前第四名從犯證人林景楠將不會出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方讀出3被告修訂同意事實&quot;&gt;控方讀出3被告修訂同意事實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後讀出林卓廷和黃碧雲，以及何桂藍的修訂同意事實。三人早前的同意事實均較其餘13名被告為少，其中林卓廷和黃碧雲僅同意與他們本人相關的事實，何桂藍則不包括戴耀廷的相關證物、抗爭派記者會等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林卓廷和黃碧雲的修訂同意事實，新增部分其他被告早前同意的事項，包括戴耀廷和吳政亨的文章和片段、趙家賢被搜得的手機資料和民主動力相關文件、各被告發布「墨落無悔」的帖文及其他競選帖文和影片、其他被告的提名表格和按金收據、抗爭派記者會等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何桂藍的修訂同意事實，則新增時任新界東地區直選選舉主任楊蕙心向何桂藍發信，要求就其問題提供書面回覆，何在回覆後，於2020年7月31日被通知提名無效。&lt;/p&gt;

Nuclear threats are rising, and U.S. allies are increasingly concerned about the credibility of U.S. security guarantees. Russia is issuing veiled threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, China is drastically increasing the size and diversity of its nuclear arsenal, North Korea is fielding more advanced nuclear weapons capabilities, and Iran is developing a high degree of nuclear latency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore these issues, the CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues leveraged an “alternative futures” methodology to unpack how key drivers might affect the U.S. extended deterrence mission in the next 10 years. In nearly all future scenarios this project explored, the United States suffers a credibility problem. It will be increasingly difficult to assure allies that the United States is prepared to employ U.S. nuclear weapons in defending their vital interests if necessary. It will require a shift in the way future administrations consult, plan, train, and operate with allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In nearly all future scenarios this project explored, the United States suffers a credibility problem.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any nuclear future, the United States’ best asset will be its allies — if it is able to maintain alliance cohesion. Allies are a center of gravity for the United States, as well as a force multiplier. The research scenarios consider changes in adversary capabilities, but in all scenarios, a cohesive and confident alliance network backed by credible extended deterrence guarantees U.S. strategic interests. Since a strong alliance network is the best weapon against Russian and Chinese aggression and risk manipulation, this report’s recommendations focus on strengthening alliance cohesion through a combination of sustained investment in the nuclear enterprise, developing capabilities to manage nuclear risks, improving communication and consultation with allies, and strengthening the United States’ overall credibility as a strategic partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;findings-summary&quot;&gt;Findings Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project set out to answer three main questions: (1) What are the strategic drivers that will shape the U.S. extended deterrence mission over the next 10 years, and how might those drivers interact to produce different outcomes, or “futures”? (2) How will U.S. concepts of integrated deterrence shape the extended deterrence mission and how might weighting various integrated deterrence objectives differently affect key elements of U.S. extended deterrence (e.g., treaty commitments, nuclear policy, forward-deployed nuclear forces, nuclear sharing and consultation arrangements, allied conventional capabilities, U.S. forces deployed abroad, and nonproliferation)? (3) What are the signposts and indicators that one of these potential futures may be more likely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drivers:&lt;/strong&gt; The study found that adversary nuclear capabilities and alliance cohesion would be the main strategic driver of the U.S. extended deterrence mission for the next decade. Adversary nuclear capabilities will be impacted by a variety of factors, including advances in nonnuclear technologies, regional ambitions, and internal factors such as economic constraints. One important variable will be whether and to what extent adversaries collude with each other. Alliance cohesion and synchronization will be another key strategic driver and will be influenced by external threat perceptions, internal political pressures, the credibility of U.S. security guarantees, and allies’ interpretation of the concept of integrated deterrence, among other factors. This report defines “synchronization challenges” among allies as a combination of political and operational factors, such as competition among allies for U.S. assurances and capabilities, a lack of interoperability at the technical level, and the overarching absence of shared strategic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a risk that allies perceive integrated deterrence as putting them in competition for U.S. attention and resources, or that integrated deterrence somehow signals a move away from “nuclear” deterrence. Additionally, the study found allies’ perceptions of U.S. domestic politics will influence alliance cohesion and U.S. credibility. Continued U.S. polarization, a lack of sustained investment in the nuclear enterprise, or fluctuations in attitudes toward the allies could undermine U.S. extended deterrence efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Deterrence:&lt;/strong&gt; Concepts of integrated deterrence will have at least three important implications for extended deterrence. First, based on all of the project scenarios, the United States will need to continue to rely on nuclear weapons for extended deterrence purposes, but it will also need to keep open the possibility of shifting investment to advanced nonnuclear capabilities and competing with Russia and China in different domains. This will require a more flexible, agile, and responsive defense investment process than currently exists. Second, the United States will need to take a more holistic approach to assuring allies in both Europe and Asia to prevent them from competing with each other for U.S. guarantees and resources. In general, the study found that the United States could improve its messaging to allies, particularly through a more robust consultation process. Finally, the study found that arms control and nonproliferation efforts are possible in all the alternative future scenarios; however, these agreements will look very different depending on adversary capabilities and alliance cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signposts:&lt;/strong&gt; The study identified a variety of signposts for each scenario. These include adversaries’ investments in nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities, allies’ requests for U.S. assets or assurances, allied and adversarial interest in arms control and risk reduction measures, and political shifts within allies’ governments. The relationship between adversaries may also signal a shifting strategic landscape, depending on whether they are working in loose coordination or a more formal cooperation. One of the most prominent signposts will be U.S. investment in the nuclear enterprise and political commitment to alliances. These signals from Washington will heavily influence the extended deterrence mission, adversaries’ willingness to engage in nuclear adventurism and manipulate strategic risks, and allies’ confidence in U.S. security guarantees and willingness to cooperate — rather than compete — with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study resulted in three overarching findings and recommendations for U.S. decisionmakers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, in order to compete in the nuclear future, the United States must sustain investment in the nuclear enterprise while also competing in nonnuclear technologies. This will require a more flexible, agile, and responsive defense investment process than currently exists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, alliance cohesion will be increasingly difficult in all nuclear futures but is essential for a successful extended deterrence mission.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, the United States can strengthen alliance cohesion not only through sustained investment in nuclear capabilities, but also by committing publicly and repeatedly to the enduring value of alliances, tailoring messages to its allies, and revamping consultation and operational planning processes with allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In order to compete in the nuclear future, the United States must sustain investment in the nuclear enterprise while also competing in nonnuclear technologies. This will require a more flexible, agile, and responsive defense investment process than currently exists.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand future U.S. extended deterrence requirements, PONI leveraged an alternative futures methodology for this project. Over the course of three workshops, PONI convened a diverse group of regional and functional experts to identify key trends and drivers that will shape the U.S. extended deterrence mission and to develop and evaluate four future scenarios that highlight outcomes, risks, and opportunities for U.S. policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first workshop, senior experts identified 11 key trends that will shape the future of the U.S. extended deterrence mission. The project team categorized these trends based on the “three Cs” of deterrence: capability, credibility, and communication — though some of the factors overlap between categories or do not neatly fit into one bucket. These trends are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;capability&quot;&gt;CAPABILITY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Growth and diversification of nuclear arsenals, both qualitatively and quantitatively&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Increased range and accuracy of adversary weapons systems, including nonnuclear capabilities, which threaten U.S. and allied assets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Expanded competition — and in some cases conflict — across multiple domains, including space and cyber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Increased transparency through social media platforms and open-source data, magnifying the ability to cause social disruption and spread misinformation and disinformation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;credibility&quot;&gt;CREDIBILITY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Synchronization and credibility challenges that cause logistical and political stress on alliance networks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Increased signaling and demand by allies and partners for U.S. capabilities and exports, including weapons sales, which stress U.S. weapons production infrastructure and political support for weapons production&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Increased demand by allies and partners for forward-deployed U.S. strategic assets in a tense geopolitical environment of competition and heightened rhetoric&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;communication&quot;&gt;COMMUNICATION&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) Confused and blurred messaging due to nonstop, multivariate communications from both allies and adversaries through multiple private and public channels&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) Increased nuclear threats and blackmail from adversaries, including during times of crisis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;other&quot;&gt;OTHER&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) Increased economic coercion though political demands and widening global interconnectivity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11) Increased number and influence of autocratic regimes around the world, some of which are strongly supported by domestic populist movements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to vote on the trends and drivers that will have the greatest effect on the future extended deterrence mission. This allowed PONI to cluster the key trends and develop a consensus on which drivers are likely to be the most significant over the next 10 years. The three most significant trends were the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Growth and diversification of nuclear arsenals&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synchronization challenges given multipolar nuclear threats stressing alliance networks&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confused and blurred messaging due to nonstop, multivariate communications&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PONI team then used the results of the first workshop and the top two drivers (growing arsenals and synchronization challenges) to develop four alternative future scenarios. PONI defined the first factor as adversaries expanding their nuclear arsenals quantitatively and qualitatively, to include means of delivery, such as hypersonic glide vehicles or dual-capable systems. With these alternative future scenarios, this research sought to illuminate how key drivers might shape future extended deterrence dynamics and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 captures the four scenarios derived from changes in adversary capabilities and alliance cohesion: (1) opportunistic competition, (2) bloc competition, (3) shifting nonnuclear competition, and (4) competition and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hpom8un.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Alternative Nuclear Future Scenarios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PONI team then generated stories that describe these futures and how they could plausibly unfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second and third workshops focused on evaluating these future scenarios and their implications, potential benefits and challenges, and risks. In particular, the workshops focused on the implications of these scenarios for (1) core aspects of the U.S. nuclear mission (i.e., how nuclear capabilities play into integrated deterrence concepts, deterrence, extended deterrence, and assurance); (2) stability and escalation risks; (3) arms control and nonproliferation; and (4) broad and enduring U.S. strategic objectives, including those related to strategic competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenarios assume that in 2032, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping remain in power in Russia and China respectively and that they continue to pursue regional ambitions and challenge the U.S.-led alliance-based international order. Both leaders are under increasing pressure to demonstrate progress in achieving their strategic aims. Putin strives to solidify his legacy and return Russia to an era of greatness following the war in Ukraine, and Xi is under pressure to deliver on promises of Chinese greatness as the People’s Republic approaches its 100th anniversary. Among allies, the scenarios assume that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) still exists, as do alliances in the Indo-Pacific, and that there are no new nuclear actors in 2032. The scenarios assume the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is still in force and that there has not been an extension or replacement of New START. Finally, the scenarios assume that the United States is following through on its current nuclear modernization plans and the program of record and is nearing completion of the modernization of the triad. As a final caveat, this analysis focuses on nuclear expansion by Russia and China and does not explicitly address North Korea or nuclear actors in the Middle East or South Asia. This was primarily because Russia and China were the focus of expert interviews and workshops; however, the authors acknowledge that actors outside Europe and Asia will impact the U.S. extended deterrence mission and these are explored in the “wild card” scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four alternative futures identify specific challenges for future and current U.S. extended deterrence requirements. They also identify signposts to indicate which scenario the United States might be moving toward, along with recommendations for how to navigate (or avoid) that pathway. The four scenarios below range from a “worst-case scenario” to a relatively stable competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8S327XE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Source: CSIS iDeas Lab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-1-opportunistic-competition&quot;&gt;Scenario 1: Opportunistic Competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunistic competition is a scenario of high adversary capabilities and low alliance cohesion. In this future, China and Russia are expanding their nuclear arsenals quantitatively and qualitatively, and the United States struggles to maintain robust alliances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the CSIS PONI workshops, one participant pointed out, “From the allies’ perspective, this is the world we are currently living in.” Although this is the worst-case scenario, it is also the most likely based on current trends among adversaries and allies — though this may depend on the outcome of the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this future, China’s nuclear arsenal stands at approximately 1,000 nuclear weapons and includes a functional nuclear triad. China’s modernization efforts leverage artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and the use of small satellites for both civilian and military purposes. Following the war in Ukraine, Russia determines its nuclear arsenal and nuclear coercion gives it a strategic advantage and increases its reliance on nuclear weapons. It focuses its modernization and expansion on new and advanced dual-capable intermediate-range missiles. It also develops new conventional systems to replace those lost in the war in Ukraine, predominantly drones and small satellites to improve its intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. China increasingly coordinates with Russia; however, there is no evidence of a formal alliance between Beijing and Moscow. Instead, they both become increasingly aggressive in their respective regions, challenge the rules-based international order, and remain opportunistic in any collaboration. They are also willing to take advantage of U.S. distraction, internal debates, or regional disputes. Growing nuclear arsenals in combination with autocratic forms of government give the adversary an advantage, as they can control defense investment without limits and are more willing to manipulate nuclear risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies are responding to the worsening security environment in diverse — and sometimes contradictory — ways, fracturing alliance cohesion and coordination and putting allies at odds with each other. European allies face multiple external and internal pressures. Externally, they continue to face persistent Russian nuclear threats and are increasingly called upon to contribute to NATO’s widening mission, including countering China’s regional aggression and global ambitions. This is a source of resentment for many western and southern European allies who have other priorities. Internally, they face growing antinuclear movements and economic pressures in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine. Operationally, NATO allies have not fully synchronized their intelligence and communication efforts and are at odds about their military contributions to the alliance. In the Indo-Pacific, allies are similarly divided about how to confront an increasingly aggressive China. The Australia–United Kingdom–United States (AUKUS) agreement is fracturing, and progress has slowed because of domestic politics in Canberra. Japan and South Korea are divided internally on how to handle China’s aggression, regional ambitions, and expansion of military capabilities. Asian allies see each other (and their European counterparts) as competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European allies remain concerned that the United States’ attention is focused on Asia, whereas Asian allies perceive the United States as distracted by the acute and enduring threat from Moscow. In Washington, decisionmakers are divided on the value of NATO and alliances and are pressuring allies to contribute more to their own defense, raising questions among allies about U.S. political commitments and the capabilities underpinning extended deterrence guarantees. Adversaries take advantage of these divisions to manipulate nuclear risks, particularly during crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;IMPLICATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A future defined by opportunistic competition will ask more of the U.S. nuclear arsenal than any other point in its history. The scenario has the highest risk of escalation, as adversaries leverage nuclear weapons and dual-capable systems for opportunistic aggression and coercion to pursue regional gains, potentially resulting in simultaneous crises. The U.S. nuclear mission will likely need to expand to consider regional nuclear warfighting and to operate in “risk management mode,” unless it develops advanced conventional capabilities that can fulfill a similar strategic deterrent function, though this seems unlikely in the next decade. The United States will also need to expand investment in nonnuclear capabilities to maintain parity with Russia and China, including precision-guided conventional long-range strike capabilities, missile defense, and ISR. In short, this is a very expensive scenario. The United States will also need to do more to strengthen its credibility with allies, including modernizing the current arsenal and potentially establishing additional forward-deployed nuclear forces in allies’ territories to signal its commitment to their security. With allies at cross-purposes, they may also unintentionally entangle each other in regional crises in the absence of functioning synchronization and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formal, treaty-based arms control with verification is highly unlikely in this scenario, but there may be an increased focus on informal risk reduction efforts in an effort to manage regional crises. Adversaries, however, will rely on the risk of escalation and manipulation to achieve their aims and will be reluctant to engage in risk reduction or arms control measures that would have a hand-tying effect in a crisis. An additional challenge for arms control will be that allies may perceive any negotiation between Washington and Moscow or Beijing as a sign of abandonment or appeasement. In the absence of strong U.S. assurances, allies may reconsider their nonproliferation commitments and explore developing independent nuclear capabilities. One workshop participant referred to this scenario as the “danger zone” of proliferation threats, whereby even if allies do not pursue independent capabilities, they may instead rely on nuclear hedging or latency. Should allies seriously consider pursuing independent nuclear capabilities, this would have significant and disastrous consequences for the NPT and global nuclear order more broadly, particularly if a U.S. ally withdraws from the NPT or the alliance system collapses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;signposts&quot;&gt;SIGNPOSTS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following indicators signify the strategic environment is on a pathway to opportunistic competition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Continued expansion of adversary nuclear and nonnuclear arsenals despite economic and domestic pressures in the aftermath of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Increased requests for nuclear sharing and forward-deployed nuclear and conventional forces by allies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Breakdown in existing agreements, such as NATO nuclear sharing or AUKUS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Increased requests for joint planning and exercises or force posture changes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Expressed allied interest in expanding strategic forces, potentially to include nuclear hedging or independent nuclear forces, along with precision-guided conventional long-range strike capabilities, missile defense systems, and additional U.S. foreign military sales&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Disputes among allies and a general lack of coordination on strategic priorities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Increased requests from allies for consultations and assurances&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) U.S. domestic debates about defense spending and the value of allies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-2-bloc-competition&quot;&gt;Scenario 2: Bloc Competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bloc competition is a scenario of high adversary capabilities and high alliance cohesion. In this future, China and Russia are expanding their nuclear arsenals quantitatively and qualitatively, and the United States maintains a strong and effective network of alliances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, as in the previous one, China and Russia have expanded their nuclear arsenals quantitatively and qualitatively and are leveraging nuclear weapons for opportunistic aggression in their respective regions, working to drive a wedge between U.S. allies and manipulating risks to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the previous scenario, in bloc competition, the United States and its allies unite around the significant threats posed by two peer competitors and implement practical political and technical tools to synchronize their efforts in deterring Moscow and Beijing. The United States and its allies operate as a united bloc with well-coordinated mechanisms for sharing intelligence and conducting joint operations and exercises. More broadly, there is a shared sense of purpose in both Europe and Asia concerning the importance of alliances, particularly in the face of autocratic adversaries, and the two regions are not acting at cross-purposes or competing with one another. In Europe, allies maintain unity in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine. NATO has nearly completed its transformation to a robust and operational political and military alliance, and its members have maintained their commitments to defense spending and successfully integrated forces and capabilities. The United States successfully expands U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea cooperation and integrates its security and economic initiatives in the Indo-Pacific — including the Quad and AUKUS — and is seen as a reliable and lasting leader in the region. The United States maintains robust and active consultations with allies, along with sustained domestic investment in U.S. strategic capabilities and a proven, enduring commitment to allies. Domestically, debates linger in Washington and in foreign capitals about defense spending, but there is an overarching commitment to alliances and a shared understanding about their strategic value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-1&quot;&gt;IMPLICATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A future defined by bloc competition may force the United States to consider significantly expanding the nuclear mission at the regional level as a risk management tool, which may include additional nuclear sharing arrangements or forward deploying additional nuclear capabilities. Allies will need to coordinate and contribute to a larger strategic mission. Working-level and operational coordination will be particularly important. Alliance cohesion will serve an important function in deterring adversary aggression at the regional level, though adversaries will still attempt to manipulate nuclear risk to divide allies. As China and Russia develop more advanced and sophisticated arsenals, U.S. allies will request and field more robust conventional options, including precision-guided conventional long-range strike capabilities, missile defense, and ISR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the prospects for arms control are still limited. Allies may encourage the United States to pursue bilateral or trilateral arms control with Beijing and Moscow to constrain their nuclear arsenals and better manage the significant escalation risks that exist in this future. But political pressures and the overall focus on competition will likely limit what, if anything, can be negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;signposts-1&quot;&gt;SIGNPOSTS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following indicators signify the strategic environment is on a pathway to bloc competition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Continued expansion of adversary nuclear arsenals despite economic and domestic pressures in the aftermath of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Increased alliance requests for conventional capabilities that fill jointly agreed roles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Increased allied support for collective deterrence and increased contributions toward a combined force posture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Shared principles and alliance coordination at the senior leadership level; at the working level, progress in intelligence sharing and operational planning contributing to a shared mission working in cooperation, rather than competition, across regions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Greater allied interest in Washington pursuing arms control and risk reduction measures with Moscow and Beijing, though U.S. support is uncertain because of domestic factors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Unified U.S. and allied domestic commitment to alliances&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-3-shifting-competition&quot;&gt;Scenario 3: Shifting Competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shifting competition is a scenario of low adversary (nuclear) capabilities and low alliance cohesion. It is a future in which Chinese and Russian nuclear expansion stalls, competition shifts to other domains, and the United States struggles to maintain robust alliances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario should not be perceived as adversaries failing to compete or ceding to U.S. regional and global supremacy; rather, it is one where adversaries shift to domains where they have a perceived competitive advantage. In this future, China’s nuclear arsenal stands at an estimated 450 warheads, well below previous projections. Sanctions and global exile in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine drastically weaken portions of the Russian economy, forcing Russia to divert resources to rebuild its conventional forces at the expense of its continued investment in strategic systems. Certain exotic delivery vehicles in Russia’s modernization program encounter technological challenges and component shortages. This scenario might see adversaries slowing their nuclear expansion but continuing to compete at the strategic level and invest in advanced nonnuclear capabilities. China and Russia largely shift competition to the conventional domain or “gray zone,” with an emphasis on disinformation campaigns to divide allies further. In this future, adversary disinformation campaigns are sowing doubt among U.S. allies about the longevity of U.S. commitments, making it difficult to coordinate effective responses and deterrence campaigns, as well as fueling disagreements over what mix of conventional, non-kinetic, and nuclear capabilities the United States and its allies need. Allies remain fearful of U.S. abandonment because of competing priorities and entrapment should the United States escalate future crises without consulting allies or building alliance cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, NATO is fractured, with some states preferring to cut their defense spending due to domestic and economic pressures in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine. Russia’s slowing nuclear expansion also raises questions about the enduring value of NATO’s nuclear mission, putting some allies at odds over whether the United States should withdraw nuclear weapons from Europe and make unilateral cuts to the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Overall, political disagreements and isolationist policies weaken NATO and decrease the credibility of collective action. In the Indo-Pacific region, AUKUS stalls for domestic reasons, but also because of changing attitudes throughout the region — including in Tokyo and Seoul — about the threat posed by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-2&quot;&gt;IMPLICATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A future defined by shifting competition will renew domestic debates about the size and purpose of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Some will argue that the United States should use the stall in Russian and Chinese investment to outcompete them in nuclear capabilities, while continuing to compete in conventional and advanced technologies — though this will face significant domestic challenges. Others will argue that the United States should focus on outcompeting in conventional and advanced technologies while pursuing nuclear arms control efforts, which may face domestic opposition but would strengthen the international nuclear regime if successful. In both cases, the United States will need to compete with Russia and China in emerging and disruptive technologies as a component of an extended deterrence strategy. In this scenario, the risk of escalation and confrontation will not disappear, but rather shift to the nonnuclear level of conflict in a new version of the stability-instability paradox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a scenario of shifting competition, the security landscape will look drastically different. The United States and its allies will need to develop coherent and meaningful responses to disinformation, gray zone, and cyber activities. In this future, the United States will have to rebuild alliance structures and convey the need for defense partnerships in a world where competition with adversaries is less visible and thus harder to communicate to allies and publics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some allies — particularly in Western Europe — may question the enduring value of the U.S. nuclear umbrella if they perceive Russian and Chinese nuclear threats as waning. Others will be reluctant to support arms control initiatives and will continue to see the U.S. nuclear umbrella as the ultimate backstop against ongoing threats from North Korea and as a means to keep China and Russia’s more aggressive gray zone tactics from escalating. Some allies may be increasingly tempted to join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, for example, under domestic pressure to show tangible progress toward fulfilling the Article VI commitments of the NPT, especially if Russia and China are reducing their arsenals. The United States will need focus on deterring nonnuclear threats while continuing to explain to allies the importance of nuclear weapons in an overarching strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;signposts-2&quot;&gt;SIGNPOSTS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following indicators signify the strategic environment is on a pathway to nonnuclear competition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Increased Russian and Chinese disinformation campaigns and gray zone activities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Backpedaling by China and Russia on investments and rhetoric surrounding nuclear modernization programs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Increased coordination and cooperation between Moscow and Beijing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Gray zone conflicts at the sub-strategic level&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Increased investment in nonnuclear strategic capabilities by adversaries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Allies’ wavering commitment to nuclear deterrence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Breakdown of alliances such as AUKUS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-4-competition-and-cooperation&quot;&gt;Scenario 4: Competition and Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competition and cooperation is a scenario of low adversary capabilities and high alliance cohesion. In this future, Chinese and Russian nuclear expansion stalls, and the United States maintains a strong and effective network of alliances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the previous scenario, economic challenges largely stall Russian and Chinese development of nuclear and advanced capabilities. In an effort to offset their stalled modernization efforts, Moscow and Beijing form a closer partnership with deeper economic, military, and political integration. They now conduct regular joint military exercises and disinformation campaigns in an attempt to divide U.S. allies. Both maintain nuclear forces for coercive purposes but focus investments primarily in advanced nonnuclear and non-kinetic capabilities to support increased gray zone activities, creating a more complex and integrated version of the stability-instability paradox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this future, European and Asian allies share a common view of the threat posed by a united China and Russia. For the United States and its allies, unity is crucial. There is a shared sense of purpose in acting as an alliance of democracies in the face of an autocratic bloc. As a result, the United States and its allies overcome information-sharing and classification challenges and develop more effective mechanisms for countering cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-3&quot;&gt;IMPLICATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the four possible futures, this scenario is the most stable and attractive security environment for the United States and its allies. However, the growing alliance between China and Russia will complicate planning and debates over what mix of nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities are needed. The implications for the U.S. nuclear mission in this scenario will be similar to those in the shifting competition scenario, whereby the United States can choose from outcompeting Russia and China in nuclear weapons, shifting investments to advanced capabilities, or using the opportunity to pursue arms control and negotiate limits on Russian and Chinese nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities. Allies who feel more assured under the U.S. nuclear umbrella and work in coordination with each other may be more likely to support arms control negotiations. Moscow and Beijing, faced with a united alliance and significant economic challenges, may be more open to such efforts. However, formal arms control will continue to be a challenge for the United States domestically and many allies could see further reductions in U.S. nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities as a sign of waning commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;signposts-3&quot;&gt;SIGNPOSTS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following indicators signify the strategic environment is on a pathway to competition and cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Backpedaling by Russia on rhetoric surrounding nuclear modernization programs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Increased coordination and cooperation between Moscow and Beijing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Gray zone conflicts at the sub-strategic level&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Increased investment in nonnuclear strategic capabilities by adversaries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Uptick in adversary uses of disinformation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Improved alliance coordination — particularly at the working level — in intelligence sharing, countering cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns, nonnuclear defense cooperation, and other policy areas, such as arms control&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Unified U.S. and allied domestic commitment to alliances&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wild-card-scenarios&quot;&gt;“Wild Card” Scenarios&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above four scenarios are informed by the two primary factors of adversary capabilities and alliance cohesion, along with the assumptions identified at the outset of this report; however, significant and unforeseen changes beyond these factors could fundamentally alter the nature of the security environment over the next decade. The PONI workshops also identified potential “wild card” factors that would have implications for U.S. extended deterrence but did not come up explicitly in the context of the four scenarios identified above. These include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese invasion of Taiwan to achieve unification by force&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change in Iran’s nuclear status&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian victory in the war in Ukraine, potentially involving nuclear use&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Significant U.S. domestic political changes, such as an insurrection&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global economic depression&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global pandemic&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thorough analysis of these events was outside of the scope of this study, but the majority of these events would likely increase stress on alliances and result in allies asking for greater assurances from the United States, both in terms of forward-deployed capabilities and political commitments to ensure their security. Other “wild cards,” however — such as economic collapse or U.S. domestic instability — could create untenable pressures on U.S. defense spending and nuclear modernization that would force a change in extended deterrence commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-comparisons&quot;&gt;Scenario Comparisons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three important similarities across all scenarios. First, adversaries will continue to challenge U.S. regional and global supremacy and will attempt to drive a wedge between Washington and its allies. Adversaries will seek to advance their interests through opportunistic aggression and by manipulating risks — particularly during crises — with the belief that the United States is risk averse and will seek a negotiated peace, and that increased risks will divide U.S. allies. Second, allies will require assurance from the United States, in both word and deed, in any of these scenarios. Maintaining a credible U.S. extended deterrent will not only strengthen security for the United States and its allies, but also have important nonproliferation benefits and improve alliance cohesion. In the broader context, the United States will be leading an alliance of democracies in the face of aggressive autocracies. Finally, arms control or risk reduction measures will be of interest to allies in all the scenarios (albeit in different forms) except the first one, which might see allies withdraw from the NPT and develop their own nuclear capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their similarities, the scenarios also have enough variation to point to how factors such as alliance unity will affect the U.S. nuclear mission. The means by which adversaries pursue their strategic interests will have implications for the U.S. nuclear force posture and how the United States invests in its strategic capabilities. For example, if Russia shifts investment to conventional and non-kinetic capabilities in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine, this may alleviate pressure on U.S. nuclear modernization. However, it will also increase the need for the United States to invest in offensive and defensive nonnuclear advanced capabilities while continuing to maintain a credible extended nuclear deterrent. Another point of variation is the degree to which Russia and China are acting in collusion. On the one hand, a sense of a unified adversarial challenge may galvanize alliance cohesion. On the other hand, a unified effort by Moscow and Beijing could sow seeds of distrust among U.S. allies through gray zone tactics and disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point of variation among the scenarios is what arms control might look like. In most of the scenarios, traditional arms control treaties will be difficult because the United States may prioritize freedom of action in how it responds to adversary buildups. In these scenarios, allies may support informal risk reduction measures, such as “Incidents at Sea”–style agreements that create political commitments and set “rules of the road” for nuclear and nonnuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In most of the scenarios, traditional arms control treaties will be difficult because the United States may prioritize freedom of action in how it responds to adversary buildups.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Findings and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Competition is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the scenarios in this report, even if adversaries develop nuclear capabilities at a slower pace than expected, they will increase investment and focus on nonnuclear strategic capabilities, particularly non-kinetic capabilities that will complicate U.S. decisionmaking in regional crises and challenge alliance cohesion. In short, the United States needs to prepare for a sustained era of competition with Russia and China as well as allies that will require ever-increasing security assurances. One particularly unique trait of this era of competition is the adversaries’ willingness to manipulate nuclear risk and rely on nuclear weapons because they assume the United States and its allies will be risk averse. This will increase the stability-instability paradox, complicating U.S. decisionmaking and potentially undermining the cohesion of the United States’ alliances and the credibility of its assurances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number and type of contested domains where competition and conflict can occur have grown from the Cold War era when alliances were formed and are increasingly blurred. Gray zone tactics such as disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks, and economic coercion — that target both the United States and its allies — allow adversaries to impose costs while hoping to avoid triggering escalation to a conventional war, let alone a nuclear one. This is raising questions about what the United States and its partners and allies should aim to deter and, depending on how and when deterrence fails, what types of responses may be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense (DOD) and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) should prioritize efforts to develop a nuclear enterprise that is agile, flexible, and responsive to the shifting geopolitical landscape as part of an integrated deterrence strategy. This will require engaging with Congress as well as the private sector and reforming defense investment and procurement, including for the nuclear enterprise. While the 2022 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review states that “‘hedging against an uncertain future’ is no longer a stated role for nuclear weapons,” the management of the U.S. nuclear enterprise must maintain a state of responsive readiness. The best way to prepare for the future is to build a flexible nuclear enterprise capable of tackling new and emerging threats as they arise. Additionally, there should be a shared understanding among allies about the mix of capabilities, both nuclear and nonnuclear, that are required to effectively deter adversaries, and greater insight into how the U.S. nuclear enterprise and wider defense infrastructure is working to fill any gaps. Given that greater alliance cooperation will enhance U.S. competitiveness and potentially allow for a pooling of resources, allies can and should be part of this effort through consultations and transparency measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Alliance cohesion and synchronization is essential for effective extended nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a long history of maintaining strong defense ties across Europe and Asia; however, isolationist policies and a decline in U.S. leadership pose significant obstacles to maintaining the strong network of alliances and partners that have kept the United States safe for decades. If alliance cohesion can be maintained, allies will be a force multiplier for the United States at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Communicating deterrence requirements and coordinating messages will be challenging in an era of disinformation and public pressures against nuclear weapons in democratic capitals. The path that leads to high alliance cohesion will not be easy. At times, disagreements will run high; however, a lack of disagreement may be a signpost indicating insincerity in dialogue and underlying alliance cohesion challenges. Since the end of World War II, U.S. commitments to provide for the defense of allies have furthered the U.S. nonproliferation mission. The 2022 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review notes “extended nuclear deterrence contributes to U.S. non-proliferation goals by giving Allies and partners confidence that they can resist strategic threats and remain secure without acquiring nuclear weapons of their own.” However, fundamental trust in the U.S. ability to secure collective defense is far from guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Current and future administrations should strengthen U.S. interagency efforts to invest, commit, message, and consult with U.S. allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invest in a responsive and adaptable nuclear infrastructure:&lt;/em&gt; Capability and credibility go hand in hand. One of the best ways to maintain a strong alliance and to avoid intra-alliance competition will be for the United States, and the DOD specifically, to sustain funding for defense infrastructure writ large, to include the nuclear enterprise, while also competing in advanced technologies and remaining responsive to nonnuclear threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commit to long-term alliances:&lt;/em&gt; U.S. policymakers and defense leaders should signal an enduring bipartisan political commitment to alliances. While political shifts are inevitable, a robust signal from Washington about the strategic importance of alliances writ large may assuage many concerns about abandonment. In addition, the DOD can take steps now to institutionalize cooperation with allies at the working level, which can further reinforce the long-term nature of U.S. commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manage alliance communication:&lt;/em&gt; DOD officials, in particular, can signal the equal importance of alliances in both Europe and Asia through improved communication and messaging. The National Defense Strategy and the focus on integrated deterrence caused some concerns, particularly in Europe, that American attention will be region-specific and some allies might be left behind. Many allies remain confused about what “integrated deterrence” means in practice and are not satisfied with U.S. explanations that European and Asian allies are of “equal importance,” while still referring to China as the long-term “pacing challenge.” Senior DOD officials should clarify this issue to help assure allies. The United States can also ask allies to contribute more to alliance security overall, such as through defense spending and joint activities. Policymakers will have to approach this delicately, however, or risk being perceived as “pressuring” allies to do more as indicative of waning U.S. commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revamp and strengthen alliance consultations:&lt;/em&gt; In the expert workshop, numerous allies indicated that what the United States considers “consultation” is often a one-sided conversation and allies do not always feel like their voices are being heard. A business-as-usual approach to extended deterrence consultations will prove ineffective in virtually all future scenarios. The increasingly complex threat environment will require a much higher level of integration with and among allies. This is particularly true in East Asia, but it also applies to NATO allies who will need to understand how heightened threats from China and North Korea could affect planning and operations in Europe and vice versa. This means that strengthening consultation mechanisms with allies will first and foremost require much more detailed conversations about specific threats, and what specifically alliances intend to deter. To prepare for this, the DOD should develop a long-term road map for revamping U.S. consultation mechanisms and work with the U.S. interagency to take a more holistic approach to reassuring allies, including through regular consultations before policy is set. The road map should also focus on increased cross-alliance activities, such as joint exercising and intelligence sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engaging allies with tailored messaging:&lt;/em&gt; In addition, the DOD can do more to engage with allies in joint wargaming and exercises and by directly involving allies in adaptive U.S. planning. In Europe, this might also entail allies taking on a greater role in alliance strategic planning in NATO, potentially to include more burden sharing. Joint coordination with Asian allies may be more challenging in the absence of a central alliance structure, but the United States should make every effort to take a more inclusive approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; Arms control is possible. It could entail informal risk reduction measures or options focused on nonnuclear capabilities. Arms control and risk reduction efforts in the future would not necessarily be unilateral measures by the United States or any of its allies, but rather reciprocal efforts with Russia and/or China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arms control and nonproliferation efforts can work hand in hand with extended deterrence. If done effectively, arms control can serve to stabilize competition and assure allies that certain types of dangerous capabilities will not be fielded. The study’s scenarios and workshops indicate that progress on nuclear arms control may be more likely if the contours of geopolitical competition shift slightly away from the nuclear domain. If the United States and its adversaries rely less on nuclear weapons and more on strategic conventional capabilities, allies may support and encourage more direct nuclear arms control efforts by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; While formal arms control treaties and reductions are unlikely in the near future, the DOD and the U.S. interagency should work with U.S. allies to develop new approaches to strategic risk reduction to manage competition with Russia and China. These new approaches can be more flexible than traditional treaty-based arms control, but transparency and verification will still be necessary guiding principles to ensure compliance by all parties. At the same time, the United States should remain open to arms control opportunities when they arise and consult closely with allies about potential cooperation with Moscow or Beijing. If progress is made on arms control efforts, there will inevitably be costs. The United States may need to engage in trade-offs. U.S. adversaries have consistently voiced interest in arms control negotiations on the deployment and development of missile defense and space capabilities. Trade-offs on these capabilities will likely make some allies uneasy. As the United States remains open to arms control opportunities, it is crucial to incorporate allies into discussions and ensure allied buy-in. Allies should be consulted throughout any arms control dialogues, particularly about the design of arms control agreements, to mitigate potential fears of U.S. appeasement and to take into account allies’ escalation concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鍾錦麟：曾向戴耀廷反映無差別否決財案或致DQ 獲回應只提積極運用基本法權力&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;鍾錦麟：趙家賢與戴耀廷就區選協調已「弄得相當不快」 隨初選執行擔憂與不滿越來越強&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;鍾錦麟：建制媒體批評初選遂憂DQ風險 對戴耀廷稱否決財案合法「疑中留情」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/teWR66Q.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（5日）踏入審訊第53天。時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟繼續作供，表示在2020年4月新界東首次協調會議完結後，曾私下向戴耀廷表示，若無差別否決預算案很可能導致參選人被DQ，戴回應「咁我唔會要求大家去無差別咁去否決財政預算案」，只會提「積極運用基本法權力」，又指「我講明係基本法嘅權力就唔會有問題啦啩？」。鍾指，首次會議集中討論初選技術問題，沒印象提及否決預算案，但認為戴相關想法是「人所共知」。鍾確認，戴在會議後曾發出新東協議文件，但沒為意在最終版本協議，運用否決權字眼由「會積極運用」改為「會運用」。鍾錦麟上午完成主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注審訊進度-着控方不要重複無爭議議題&quot;&gt;官關注審訊進度 着控方不要重複無爭議議題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉今甫開庭表示，控方案情原定需55天，現時已是審訊第53天，他指當然知道審訊進度，並不是要怪責控方，但相信現時控方已清楚本案真正的議題。陳並指，鍾錦麟昨日的證供除個人背景外，大部分都是沒有爭議，「我們不希望聽取有關初選舉行的證供3次」，着控方不要重複。羅天瑋表示會緊記此點，不會問沒爭議的議題。陳慶偉並提醒他要不時望向左邊的辯方律師，指「他們沒有抄下任何筆記」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱曾向戴耀廷稱否決財案或被dq-戴稱講明基本法權力唔會有問題啦啩&quot;&gt;鍾稱曾向戴耀廷稱否決財案或被DQ 戴稱講明基本法權力「唔會有問題啦啩」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟昨供稱，獲戴耀廷邀請主持新東會議，他今稱首次新東會議完結後，他在會議室外「拉咗戴耀廷埋一邊」，告訴他「出邊有好多嘅講法，如果我哋會去無差別咁否決財政預算案呢，好可能會導致我哋所有人都被DQ嘅，可唔可以唔好要求大家去否決財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾在法官李運騰追問下表示，這是他和戴的私人對話，「純粹係我同戴耀廷之間嘅對話，我向佢表達我嘅憂慮」；而他是以正常聲線說話，因為已「散咗會」，當時可能有一兩個人如時任沙田區議會主席程張迎在附近，但不肯定有否聽到。鍾並指，當時其他與會者已離開，趙家賢和區諾軒也不在場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾續指，戴當時回應：「咁我唔會要求大家去無差別咁去否決財政預算案，我只會話積極運用基本法嘅權力去否決財政預算案」，又指「我講明係基本法嘅權力就唔會有問題啦啩？」，鍾引述後句時聲調在結尾略為提高。李運騰問，留意到鍾的語調改變，問戴當時是否提出問題，鍾同意「係一個問題」，並指認為自己已很如實反映戴當時的語調。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱戴耀廷望否決財案想法人所共知惟首次會議冇印象有提及&quot;&gt;鍾稱戴耀廷望否決財案想法「人所共知」惟首次會議「冇印象」有提及&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，鍾當時向戴提出該議題，是與會上發言有關嗎？鍾指「我係基於戴耀廷希望用35+否決財政預算案嘅想法，我會形容係人所共知嘅」。法官陳仲衡問，該想法或是「人所共知」，但協調會議上有否提出？鍾答「冇印象」，而他向戴耀廷提出，是因看到很多不同團體，如親政府或親中央政府的人士表示若無差別否決預算案，會導致參選人被DQ。李運騰問，故在4月中，社會上已有意見指出，無差別否決預算案會成為參選人被DQ的理由？鍾同意，亦同意戴是對他們作出回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋其後展示戴耀廷3月3日發布的〈反制警察政權就要立會奪半〉、3月10日的〈齊上齊落 目標35+〉，鍾確認均在與戴耀廷對話前看過。鍾表示，除上述私人對話，便沒有與戴耀廷就同一議題再討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱首次會議集中初選技術問題-戴耀廷區諾軒不停參與討論&quot;&gt;鍾稱首次會議集中初選技術問題 戴耀廷區諾軒不停參與討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後問，首次會議有否聽到社民連陳寶瑩表示反對意見？鍾稱「冇印象」，「因為我記得當日嘅會議真係集中喺個初選點樣去進行嘅技術問題，係關於初選定棄選方案，同目標出選議席嘅方案」，並再確認與戴的討論只是基於戴發表的文章，以及媒體上建制派人士的意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟昨供稱獲戴耀廷邀請主持新東會議，他今指戴沒邀請他主持某次會議，惟「總之呢個區會議都係我主持」。李運騰一度笑問，鍾稱首次會議遲到，到達時與會者已在發言，「那你怎樣主持會議？會議怎能在你不在時開始？」鍾解釋因時任沙田區議會主席程張迎也有主持會議，而戴耀廷和區諾軒「喺成個會議過程都有不停去參與討論」。李問他有否參與任何討論，鍾指就是主持兩項討論，即昨提及的採用「初選」或「棄選」方案，及目標議席數量。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋其後問，鍾在5月底有否與戴會面，鍾稱「冇印象」。至於5月5日的新東第二次會議，鍾指他原本應該要出席，但因當天區議會逾時，故沒有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾確認戴在兩次新東會議後均發出協調文件-相信曾發給所有與會者&quot;&gt;鍾確認戴在兩次新東會議後均發出協調文件 相信曾發給所有與會者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋續展示 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示戴耀廷在首次新東會議兩日後的4月16日，曾發出名為「35+新東」的文件，鍾確認有收到及打開，但就運用否決權字眼，「冇好準確印象究竟係『會』定係『積極』。」鍾並指，在戴向所有新東協調會議參與者發出上述文件前，他曾透過私人 WhatsApp 對話從戴收到一個初稿，並與戴討論目標議席的寫法與會議的共識有不同，戴更正後再向大家發文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，鍾如何得知戴將文件發給所有人？鍾解釋，因戴發訊息後，他曾在新民主同盟的 WhatsApp 群組收到范國威轉發同一份文件，故相信戴「係將呢份文件廣發咗畀唔同嘅人」，他並確認修正的版本反映會上討論的事項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴在第二次新東會議的兩日後，於5月7日發出「35+新東final」文件，鍾確認收到相關訊息。控方續展示該份「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」文件，惟鍾指沒有印象，「因為我似乎冇開到」，其後亦指因他沒參與第二次會議，「亦都冇特別興趣睇返個會議嘅文件。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋一度問文件與「35+新東」是否相似，惟法官陳慶偉打斷指他們可看到；羅亦問鍾有否與戴就文件字眼討論，陳慶偉着問下一條問題，李運騰亦指證人已表示對文件沒印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱沒為意協議最終版本字眼由會積極運用改為會運用&quot;&gt;鍾稱沒為意協議最終版本字眼由「會積極運用」改為「會運用」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾續確認，戴耀廷於6月8日，在趙家賢要求下於組織者群組發出各個選區協議的最終版本，包括「35+新東final」，鍾有收到和打開，但沒有與戴討論，亦對新東文件「冇話特別大興趣」。鍾並確認5月7日和6月8日發出的文件內容一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意法官李運騰指，沒爭議4月中發出的「35+新東」文件使用「會積極運用」否決權字眼，但重申4月收到文件時「冇特別去留意」，因他只是留意「係咪按照戴耀廷嘅講法係講明係基本法嘅權力」；李續問，那鍾有沒有留意到在6月8日的「35+新東final」文件，運用否決權字眼由「會積極運用」改為「會運用」？鍾指「冇為意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾表示，直至7月10日，也沒有收到與會者對新東文件提出反對或投訴，又一度提及6月10日曾發布「墨落無悔」。羅天瑋其後問，鍾就「墨落無悔」有什麼想告訴法庭？惟陳慶偉即打斷，指雖然控方要問開放的問題，但不是如宇宙般廣閣（as wide as universe），着他問具體的問題，又指控方有「墨落無悔」的聲明，究竟想問鍾什麼？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;墨落無悔提已取得共識-鍾稱以為係咪就否決預算案已有共識&quot;&gt;「墨落無悔」提「已取得共識」 鍾稱「以為係咪就否決預算案已有共識」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋其後展示何桂藍 Facebook 的「墨落無悔」帖文，提及「在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領」，問鍾如何理解「共識」。鍾指以其理解，首次會議是關於「初選上面邊啲人去參選、邊啲人唔去參選，點樣遵守呢個機制」，「而我睇到呢個『墨落無悔』嘅時候，會以為係咪已經就住否決財政預算案方面，已經有共識。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，民主動力負責草擬提名表格，鍾稱他沒有參與，只是在組織者群組看過總幹事黎敬輝發出的文件，表示「可以啦」。鍾亦是「新東訊息發布區」的成員，指因趙家賢想他幫手在群組內「幫手睇吓，幫吓眼」。鍾亦同意，曾以區議會主席身分幫忙物色票站，及提供議員辦事處作票站，在7月11日至12日的初選投票日均有親自協助，趙家賢7月12日晚亦有到場視察。羅天瑋發問時一度說錯投票日為7月11至13日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅其後稱會引用有關初選流程的訊息發問，惟法官李運騰打斷問有何相關性，陳慶偉亦問趙家賢在其辦事處與案何關。羅指望完整本案有關流程的部分，以及鍾的參與，惟李運騰指所有人都知道不同議員辦事處用作票站，「我們不是審理這名證人，是審理各個被告。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋其後問鍾，昨稱與戴耀廷7月進行討論，是討論了什麼，惟陳慶偉指問題太空泛，下令早休，又着羅要準備好問題。羅早休後稱沒有其他問題，進入辯方盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/grL473v.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（5日）踏入審訊第53天。時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟接受辯方盤問，供稱趙家賢早在2020年初前，已就區議會選舉協調與戴耀廷「弄得相當不快」，而在初選協調時亦對戴是否將初選遇到的問題告知民動「有好多擔憂同不滿」，且越來越強烈。鍾並指，2020年2月3名民動召集人與戴耀廷會面時沒討論參選人當選後如何行事，指民動過往協調也沒監察當選議員的投票取態，「我認為戴耀廷都唔會覺得民主動力有力去執行民主派議員喺立法會嘅所作所為。」鍾又同意，首次新東會議無提及否決財政預算案，並同意否決財案的確令許多民主派議員「擺喺一個非常之困難嘅情況」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾同意梁國雄否決財案其中一個原因是沒有全民退保&quot;&gt;鍾同意梁國雄否決財案其中一個原因是沒有全民退保&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟今早完成主問，由代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸進行盤問。鍾錦麟同意，社民連是左翼政黨，「佢哋都係咁樣去宣稱」，亦一直爭取全民退休保障、對爭取雙普選「亦非常之堅定」，而梁國雄的政治立場與社民連一致。鍾又指，知悉曾任立法會議員的梁國雄常提倡全民退保，亦常提及否決預算案的其中一個原因是沒有全民退保。黃宇逸完成盤問，其後代表吳政亨和余慧明、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明的大狀，及自行代表的劉偉聰均稱沒有盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱趙家賢不希望民主動力被邊緣化-是參與協調最主要原因&quot;&gt;鍾稱趙家賢不希望民主動力被邊緣化 是參與協調「最主要原因」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文其後盤問，沈先指鍾於2022年12月19日和2023年1月28日曾錄取兩份無損權益口供，並就民主動力參與協調的原因發問。鍾錦麟昨供稱，趙家賢望參與2020年立法會換屆選舉的協調，望在選舉「有角色」。沈指趙和民主動力有興趣協調的其中一個原因，是因民動自2012年已進行同樣的協調工作，鍾同意，並指民動自2016年立法會選舉「有付出過努力去協調」，惟只在2018年新東及九西立法會補選「成功過一次」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/h8OjR4v.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃碧雲（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，趙如此熱衷參與協調有兩個原因，即民主動力多年來進行協調，邏輯上（logically）應繼續做協調；及趙家賢不希望民主動力被邊緣化和排除在外。鍾稱前者並非最主要原因，指「我唔能夠肯定係咪理所當然」；而後者是趙望做協調的「最主要原因」，因這會影響之後區議會選舉的協調工作，趙是鑑於2019年區選結果有此擔憂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾同意民主動力2月同意與戴耀廷同辦初選會上無提否決預算案&quot;&gt;鍾同意民主動力2月同意與戴耀廷同辦初選、會上無提否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意，就2020年立法會選舉的工作，「冇乜人睬」趙家賢，但趙對協調工作仍很有興趣，民動另一名副召集人馮志活知情後便介入，「將民主動力同戴耀廷區諾軒兩方面撮合」，4人遂在2020手2月於太古城一間酒店的餐廳會面。鍾同意辯方指，會面目的是讓戴耀廷和民主動力一同參與選舉協調工作，「令到兩邊唔需要做重複嘅事情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，根據鍾的無損權益口供，戴會上從無提及否決預算案。鍾同意，並指戴主要談及望泛民取得立會過半，會面結果是同意戴和民主動力一同進行協調。法官李運騰問有否討論分工，鍾重申戴就初選流程、找人寫程式等「其實佢已經諗好晒㗎啦」，戴和區諾軒亦已在聯絡候選人；而「如果真係有啲協議需要有個團體去簽署呀，或者有銀行戶口做眾籌呀」，戴就希望民動幫手。惟鍾同意，雖有協議共同組織初選，但沒有簽署任何文件或合約。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾同意民動及戴耀廷當時不關注當選後如何行事-指過往協調亦無監察當選後取態&quot;&gt;鍾同意民動及戴耀廷當時不關注當選後如何行事 指過往協調亦無監察當選後取態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意辯方指，從民動角度而言，3名召集人參與會面的目標很單純，只是希望協調民主派取得立會過半，亦從不關注參選人當選後如何行事。李運騰續問，戴耀廷在2月時同樣不關注參選人當選後如何行事？鍾指當時沒有相關討論，「因為我認為戴耀廷都唔會覺得民主動力有力去執行民主派議員喺立法會嘅所作所為。」鍾又舉例，過往民動雖有協調區議會選舉，但民動「亦都冇話去監察嗰啲區議員當選後嘅投票取態，係咪同民主派相近」，即不會有「懲罰機制」，故立法會的協調「都應該會好相近」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈其後再問，鍾個人參與「35+計劃」的目標是否讓民主派取得議會多數，從而可在制度內表達意見，鍾稱「認同，盡力去做」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱趙家賢在區選協調上同戴耀廷已經弄得相當不快對戴不滿越來越強&quot;&gt;鍾稱趙家賢在區選協調上「同戴耀廷已經弄得相當不快」、對戴不滿越來越強&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟同意，會議後戴耀廷和趙家賢就準備初選有緊密溝通，民動亦參與初選的準備工作，民動職員有協助；鍾亦開始閱讀戴有關否決預算案的文章。沈續問，會後趙家賢曾否表達對計劃的憂慮、並指答應辦初選前需考慮？鍾稱不肯定，但之後「趙家賢表達對戴耀廷嘅憂慮，呢個就絕對有嘅」，指趙對戴是否願意「將呢個初選裡面遇到嘅唔同問題都同民主動力講呢，係有好多嘅擔憂同不滿嘅」，且隨初選的執行，趙的擔憂和不滿越來越強烈。鍾亦指，早在2020年2月以前，在區議會選舉協調的事情上，趙家賢「同戴耀廷已經弄得相當不快」，同意在會面前趙對戴已有不太好的印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱沒聽過人不同意否決預算案-但的確令民主派擺在非常之困難情況&quot;&gt;鍾稱沒聽過人不同意否決預算案 但的確令民主派擺在「非常之困難」情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鍾本人，他同意對戴耀廷提倡否決預算案有擔憂。被問是何時有此擔憂，鍾稱是在4月的新東協調會議前，戴將整個否決預算案的計劃「越嚟越具體化」、「講得越詳細」，而建制派或親中央政府人士反應越來越強烈的時候。鍾並指，沒有將其關注告知趙家賢，但於首次新東會議後有向戴表達，望戴不要要求參與者無差別否決財案。鍾同意辯方指，他表達上述關注是擔心會有DQ風險。沈續問，鍾除了擔心DQ，是否也擔心傳統民主派不會同意無差別否決預算案？鍾回應「呢個唔係我當時嘅考慮」，指有傳統民主派如公民黨亦曾於3月召記者會提出否決財案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續引鍾口供，曾提及傳統民主派不會同意「攬炒」，因若政府提出建醫院，相信他們不會支持無差別否決預算案。鍾確認是其想法，但指與戴的對話沒提及。李運騰問鍾有否實際聽過民主派如此說，鍾指沒有，但指自己任區議會主席，其中一項政綱是擴建將軍澳醫院，「我只係覺得我呢個諗法，係會代表好多民主派地區工作者嘅諗法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈其後再問，故鍾當時向戴耀廷表達擔憂，是認為將否決預算案加入計劃，很多民主派不會同意？鍾稱：「我冇聽過任何人話不同意呢個諗法，但係呢個情況的確會令好多嘅民主派，尤其是啱啱拎到主導權嘅區議會議員，擺喺一個非常之困難嘅情況。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾信戴稱否決財案冇問題-惟認不太理解積極運用及無差別分別&quot;&gt;鍾信戴稱否決財案「冇問題」 惟認不太理解「積極運用」及「無差別」分別&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟早前稱向戴耀廷表達關注後，戴回應「我唔會要求大家去無差別咁去否決財政預算案」，只會說「積極運用基本法嘅權力」否決預算案。鍾盤問下指「我當時相信咗戴耀廷嘅講法，而認為咁樣冇問題」，但承認事實上「唔係好理解兩者嘅差別」。法官陳仲衡續問，鍾當時是否相信無差別否決預算案是《基本法》賦予的權力？鍾稱他沒仔細考慮是否有「無差別」的權力，亦知道此舉有被DQ風險，「但呢個風險實際上理據係乜嘢呢，我當時係唔清楚嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意，戴其後稱「我講明係基本法嘅權力就唔會有問題啦啩？」是反問，並同意當時沒有再討論，是因相信戴的說法。沈指，戴作為法律教授，對法律的理解應比鍾更好，惟陳慶偉不批准發問，指情況不一定是這樣。鍾其後同意，他除調解外無任何專業的法律訓練，惟當辯方再問戴是否法律上更專業時，法官再打斷稱問題不需要，可留待陳詞。沈一度指盤問區諾軒時亦一直問相關問題，惟李運騰指「我們已聽夠了」，指該點沒需要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾確認新東首次會議無討論否決財政預算案&quot;&gt;鍾確認新東首次會議無討論否決財政預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新東首次會議情況，鍾同意會面原定晚上7至9時進行，他遲了約15至30分鐘到達，但不記得有其他與會者比他遲到，只記得有一個「唔關事、嚟錯咗個場地」的人。鍾稱會上約有20至30名參與者，但不記得社民連由誰代表，亦沒印象他有任何發言，但記得劉頴匡「佢有堅持用初選嘅方案囉，而唔係個棄選方案」，亦同意林卓廷沒有出席，但不記得民主黨代表是否莊榮輝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾表示，負責主持會議的他、戴耀廷及程張迎沒有討論過分工，「只係個討論、個流程去到嗰個部分時鍾意就插嘴咁樣。」而他到場時與主持的程張迎、戴耀廷和區諾軒坐在同一排，與會者則坐在他們面前，戴耀廷要求參與者自我介紹後，便主要討論採用「初選」或「棄選」方案及目標議席，「我冇印象討論過其他嘢」，會上氣氛平靜。鍾今年1月28日於無損權益口供稱，「第一次新界東協調會會上未有討論否決財政預算案」，鍾確認內容正確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OHy5cE3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 左起：趙家賢、程張迎、鍾錦麟（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就戴耀廷會議後發出的新東協調文件初稿和最終版本，鍾重申「冇去留意」運用否決權條款亦沒提反對，「因為我主要都係睇個初選嘅遊戲規則係點樣做」，並同意他較關注目標議席數量，對否決預算案議題則完全沒興趣。辯方問他沒提反對，是否因戴曾向他稱只會要求「積極運用基本法權力否決預算案」？鍾同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UwlqEJt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（5日）踏入審訊第53天，時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟繼續接受辯方盤問。被問為何認為否決預算案或致參選人被DQ，鍾稱是從媒體得知，指他「純粹相信」建制媒體的「風聲」某程度代表中央想法，而2019年後中央對港政策「唔會不為所動」，故認為有一個風險要謹慎處理。而對戴稱否決預算案是「《基本法》賦予的權力」，鍾對戴說法「疑中留情」，指不清楚會如何觸發中央調整對港政策，故「拆彈拆得一樣得一樣」。趙亦指，表面看來《基本法》的確賦予立法會相關權力，當時亦相信戴稱是「合法」，「我拗唔過戴耀廷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，鍾稱何桂藍在新東首次會議上介紹自己為「立場姐姐」，惟何桂藍兩度大叫：「肯定冇！」她身旁的懲教一度按她的肩膊，法官亦着她不要叫囂。鍾亦表示，戴在2020年5月底曾向他表示所有初選協調已完成和有共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱相信建制媒體某程度代表中央政府想法對初選批評來自建制不同方面&quot;&gt;鍾稱相信建制媒體某程度代表中央政府想法、對初選批評來自建制不同方面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟下午接受代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 盤問。鍾今早供稱，新東首次會議後曾向戴耀廷表示無差別否決預算案或導致參選人被DQ，戴回應只會提「積極運用基本法權力」，又指「我講明係基本法嘅權力就唔會有問題啦啩？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9dPwvLu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問鍾為何認為否決預算案會導致參選人被DQ，鍾指「因為從媒體上面得知」。Beel 指他不明白，陳慶偉亦托頭笑指「媒體可以說很多事情（“Media can say a lot of things.”）」，鍾說「不幸地都會成真」，有人大笑。陳慶偉指只是部分而非全部，因為存在假資訊（disinformation），鍾回應所以有此擔憂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，真正的問題是「為何鍾相信否決預算案可能導致DQ？」，並指原因更加重要，結論並不重要。鍾表示，「我純粹相信由建制媒體報導呢啲嘅風聲，某程度上都代表咗中央政府嘅諗法」，又指2019年社會事件後，「中央政府嘅對港政策唔會不為所動，所以我覺得係有呢一個風險要謹慎去處理」，並指對整個初選的批評是來自建制的不同方面，而非來自個別版塊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，因此鍾有此想法，是建基於建制派的說法？鍾同意，並指是在2019年的脈絡下閱讀相關訊息。陳續問，因此即使戴向他指這是基本法賦予的權力，也沒有改變他的看法？鍾指，「我帶住一個，或者咁講，『疑中留情』囉」，解釋是對戴耀廷的說法「疑中留情」，並指相信中央可能會有「組合拳」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭傳譯問「組合拳係咩？」，多人大笑，庭上亦議論紛紛，陳慶偉提議譯「combination of punches in boxing」、李運騰稱「combination of strategies」。鍾同意可算是一些「策略」，並指「但係千頭萬緒，唔清楚究竟乜嘢會觸發去大規模咁調整對港嘅政策，所以拆彈拆得一樣得一樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱當時相信戴耀廷稱否決財案合法-指我拗唔過戴耀廷&quot;&gt;鍾稱當時相信戴耀廷稱否決財案「合法」 指「我拗唔過戴耀廷」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指他不明白，指鍾在4月中時已對無差別否決預算案引致DQ感憂慮，而他特意在會後向戴表達，戴則只是以反問回應，「你就對戴耀廷的回應感到滿意？還是你有做什麼釋除疑慮？」鍾回應：「我覺得最好唔好（提否決預算案），但我當時相信咗戴耀廷話呢件事係合法嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再指，戴是被批評的對象，但鍾卻對戴的解釋感滿意？鍾強調「我嘅關注就係有冇犯法」，指「表面睇，《基本法》的確係賦予咗立法會去審批政府開支嘅權力，我當刻唔能夠去答戴耀廷（否決預算案）點樣犯法」。鍾同意，此前已知道《基本法》賦予相關權力，李再問那與戴的對話有什麼改變他看法？鍾僅稱「我拗唔過戴耀廷」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後再問，鍾錦麟2020年是否相信參選人提出反政府的議題，有機會導致被DQ？鍾稱參考過往被DQ的例子，不可提倡「港獨」和「自決」，「呢個係紅線中嘅紅線」，並同意戴倡否決財案有DQ風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾指何桂藍會上自介立場姐姐-何大聲稱肯定冇&quot;&gt;鍾指何桂藍會上自介「立場姐姐」 何大聲稱：肯定冇！&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新東首次會議情況，鍾稱遲到後戴已稱「不如大家介紹一次自己先啦」，鍾沒有嘗試問人自己錯過什麼，Beel 問是因為他相信會議剛開始嗎？鍾答「我相信個會議冇話冇咗我唔得」，旁聽席傳來笑聲，鍾其後確認沒有問是因感覺會議剛開始。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，鍾是否不記得何桂藍會上有發言，鍾稱「記得佢介紹過自己係『立場姐姐』囉」，惟原本低頭打字的何桂藍即抬頭，瞪着眼睛大聲喊：「肯定冇！」法官陳慶偉着她不要叫囂，何身旁的懲教亦按着其肩膊。鍾頓一頓，再解釋「佢嘗試話人哋叫我係『立場姐姐』」，惟何桂藍即再大喊：「冇！肯定冇！」懲教人員再按其肩膀。Beel 問據鍾記憶所及，這就是何說的話？鍾指「我記得嘅就係呢部份」。Beel 其後問，鍾是否記得何在會上有發言，鍾稱「有嘅，不過我唔記得咗係乜嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾指戴耀廷5月底曾提及所有協調已完成及取得共識&quot;&gt;鍾指戴耀廷5月底曾提及所有協調已完成及取得共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，鍾亦確認只曾出席新東首次會議，而會上已就「初選點樣進行」達成共識。至於其他會議的情況，他確認依靠其他人訊息及收取的文件得知。Beel 問主要是由戴耀廷講述？鍾續憶述5月底時，戴曾相約他、程張迎、時任大埔區議會主席關永業及時任北區區議會主席羅庭德，在沙田新城市中央廣場的 Beans 餐廳午膳，除羅庭德外的其他人均有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾稱，戴耀廷曾提及「所有嘅初選協調已經完成咗同埋有共識啦」，亦已敲定整個初選流程，戴並望各區議會主席協助找新界東的票站，又提議找黃店做票站。戴又指，若大家都能協助找票站會對大家「最公平」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iZZ9pBg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱新民主同盟緣起不滿民主黨入中聯辦商政改方案35比雷動計劃目標更明確&quot;&gt;鍾稱新民主同盟緣起不滿民主黨入中聯辦商政改方案、「35+」比「雷動計劃」目標更明確&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾在 Beel 盤問下亦同意，2016年成為民主動力副召集人，而民動當年立法會選舉曾協調，但不成功。Beel 續問，戴同年發起「雷動計劃」，目標是否與2020年相近，即在立會爭取「35+」？鍾稱不肯定當時是爭取「過半議席」抑或「最多嘅議席」，而且當時「更加冇提及到財政預算案嘅問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續展示鍾首份供詞，提及「雷動計劃」目標是「爭取民主派於2016年香港立法會選舉取得達半議席」，鍾稱供詞是「較籠統」的說法，並指達半是「理想的情況」，但相較2020年，2016年是沒有這種「大規模」甚至協調功能組別的情況，強調「2020年嘅目標係更加明確」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後問，鍾曾加入民主黨，其後加入新民主同盟，問兩黨有何分別。鍾稱「兩句啦」，指「新民主同盟嘅緣起就係不滿當年民主黨進入中聯辦商討政改方案從而通過政改方案」，而兩者理念的不同，是新民主同盟會爭取在一國兩制框架下，政府落實一些「港人優先」的政策。鍾同意民主派有不同政黨，Beel 續問令各政黨走在一起的是否對普選的渴望？即這是各黨均同意的訴求？鍾指「籠統啲講係囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，李運騰一度問及新東首次協調會議於教協會址的場地設置，鍾解釋是長形的活動室，擺放長枱讓人於兩邊就坐。李問房間有多大，鍾稱「唔識形容」，其後在法官要求下以雙手比劃，指是由法庭的一邊到另一邊，約佔三號法庭面積四分三。法官陳慶偉指是很大的房間，李運騰亦指是大廳（hall）而非房間，鍾稱「教協間房係好大㗎」，故常在該處舉行記招。李問是否可能有人在鍾沒留意下出入，鍾否認，稱「門口得一個」。陳慶偉指20人只佔房間的一小部分，鍾稱「我諗五分四度啦」，林卓廷笑說：「吓？五分之四？」鍾其後同意，會議場地正是6月9日初選記者會的場地，可作參考。&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, Russia has changed course multiple times, most recently moving to target Ukrainian electrical grid and civilian infrastructure during the winter months. Russia’s haphazard missile campaign reflects both internal strategic failures and Ukraine’s critical forward thinking in the days prior to the invasion. Early Russian failures also gave time for Ukraine to develop its air defense strategy and capabilities which have only grown in effectiveness, thanks in large part to Western aid. This report provides an in-depth review of these and related “missile war” dynamics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-data-sources&quot;&gt;Methodology and Data Sources&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accurately assessing an ongoing war is challenging, and any analysis or narrative deserves a healthy level of skepticism and scrutiny. However, the high level of attention on the war in Ukraine has produced a large quantity of publicly available information. Ukrainian, UK, and U.S. defense and intelligence agencies have provided a steady stream of information on and insights into the performance and availability of Russian missiles and the effects of Russian strike operations. Media reports of major missile attacks and firsthand video and images from the battlespace provide valuable snapshots of events on the ground. Researchers on the ground have also added invaluable insights. When taken together, a rough picture and timeline of the air and missile war have come into view, enabling some preliminary conclusions about the nature of Russia’s long-range strike operations in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data cited and visualized in this report is mainly drawn from several Ukrainian government sources. These include numbers released by the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Command Staff of the Ukrainian Air Force, and a more detailed data set covering Russian missile strikes between February 28 and July 21 produced by the Staff of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, which Reuters partially published in August 2022. Available information on Russian missile use in Ukraine has evolved, and in some instances, these data do not fully align. As such, readers should consider the data sets presented in this report as estimations and snapshots of general trends instead of hard, independently confirmed numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s long-range strike campaign of air and missile attacks has fallen short of producing the strategic effects necessary to achieve a decisive victory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key drivers of this failure have been the Ukrainian military’s extensive use of dispersion, mobility, and deception and the comparative slowness of Russia’s over-the-horizon targeting cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the war’s outset, Russia significantly underestimated the scale of effort required to accomplish its goals. In its initial operation to gain air superiority, Russia failed to achieve mass and tried to attack too many targets with too few missiles over too short a period to achieve its desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s strike campaign has also been undermined by frequent shifts in targeting priorities and the irregular availability of precision-guided munitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian air defenses have deterred Russian Air Force aircraft from launching penetrating sorties against strategic targets deep behind the front lines. This success has greatly shaped the course of the war, limiting Russian striking power to diminishing numbers of stand-off missiles or uncrewed aerial systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and industry have deepened Ukraine’s dependency on the West. This dependency supports Russia’s goal of exhausting the West’s patience and compelling Western capitals to pressure Ukraine to make concessions. This Russian theory of victory will also fail, however, unless Western governments accommodate it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia has seen relatively greater operational success in its campaign to degrade the Ukrainian electrical grid, though Ukraine has proven resilient to these hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine has seen increasing success in intercepting Russian cruise missiles, particularly since the influx of Western air defenses systems in October and November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian air and missile defenses have not been leak-proof, however, highlighting the importance of passive defense and maintaining the capacity to quickly reconstitute capabilities and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the fall of 2022, Russia’s long-range missile attacks against Ukraine have become larger but less frequent as Russia attempts to overcome the growing efficiency of Ukrainian air defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia is likely to struggle to maintain the frequency of attacks moving forward as its missile stockpiles diminish and it becomes more reliant on newly produced or recently acquired projectiles to fuel its attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with a diminished frequency, sustained air attacks against Ukraine’s electrical grid over the long term risk exhausting Ukraine’s capacity to sustain repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to degrading Ukraine’s electrical grid, the composition of Russian missile salvos since October 2022 suggests a secondary Russian goal of depleting Ukrainian air defense capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diminished air defense capacity would not only put Ukraine at greater risk from Russian missile attack but raise the prospects of the Russian Air Force resuming penetrating sorties into Ukrainian airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the extent possible, replenishing Ukraine’s air defense capacity should remain a priority for Western military aid for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine has demonstrated throughout the war that Russian ballistic and cruise missiles are manageable threats and can be countered effectively through active and passive defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February 2022, Russia has fired thousands of missiles and loitering munitions at Ukraine’s cities, infrastructure, and military forces. These attacks have killed and maimed thousands of Ukrainian civilians and military personnel and have heavily damaged Ukraine’s infrastructure and economy. Russia has had a pronounced advantage over Ukraine in long-range, precision-guided munitions throughout the war. Nevertheless, Russia has struggled to use this advantage to produce the kind of decisive strategic effects that Moscow likely expected to deliver a quick Ukrainian capitulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year into the war, the Ukrainian military’s command and control apparatus remains intact. Ukraine’s air force and air defenses, while diminished, continue to frustrate Russian air and missile operations. Western weaponry continues to flow to the front lines, and the morale of the Ukrainian people remains steadfast despite enormous hardships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s long-range strike campaign in Ukraine contrasts starkly with those waged by the United States and coalition military forces during Operation Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom. In these wars, U.S. cruise missiles and other precision-guided munitions played a pivotal role in fracturing Iraq’s military from its political leadership, suppressing enemy air defenses, and achieving coalition air supremacy. These actions contributed directly to the Iraqi military’s quick defeat on the battlefield and the demise of Saddam Hussein’s regime. By contrast, Russia’s inability to achieve similar strategic effects with its guided missiles gave Ukraine the time and breathing room to disperse and reconstitute its forces and repel the main thrust of Russia’s attack in the early phases of the war. Russia’s continued inability to achieve air superiority and disrupt Ukrainian logistics has permitted the Ukrainian Armed Forces to prosecute aggressive counteroffensives with increasingly sophisticated weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a successful strike campaign, one would expect a belligerent to become less dependent on stand-off strike assets over time as it wore down its adversary’s air force and air defenses. Yet Russia has experienced the opposite in Ukraine. Its failure to achieve air superiority in the early phases has caused an increasing dependence on missiles and other stand-off weapons, such as one-way attack drones, to strike targets anywhere beyond the front lines. In this way, Russia has become a victim of the kind of anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategies that it itself has sought to develop over many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the broadest sense, one cannot separate Russia’s haphazard missile campaign against Ukraine from wider strategic failures that have plagued nearly all aspects of Moscow’s war effort. Yet some unique factors have contributed to the underperformance of Russian missile forces. Russia’s intelligence and targeting capabilities have been too slow and inflexible to keep pace with a dynamic, fast-changing battlespace. Russia also underestimated the scale of strike operations needed to accomplish its goals at the beginning of the war, and Ukrainian air defenses have limited the number of Russian missiles reaching their targets. Although the impact of Ukrainian air defenses is difficult to independently confirm, the general trendlines suggest the force is growing more efficient and capable of thinning out Russian missile and drone salvos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While strategically ineffective, Russia’s missile strikes against Ukraine have had tragic consequences. Russian missiles have inflicted their greatest damage against civilian targets, industry, and infrastructure. Since failing to reach its initial objectives, Russia has begun to increasingly target Ukraine’s industry, including Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, defense industrial facilities, and transportation infrastructure. Russia has also attempted to use its stand-off missile capabilities to disrupt the flow of Western weapons and supplies to the front lines, although this effort appears to have failed beyond temporary disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also used missile attacks as instruments of psychological warfare. These actions have included attacks on civilian targets and possible false-flag operations aimed at degrading support for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and demoralizing Ukrainian civilians. Russia has used missile strikes to retaliate after Ukrainian military successes. However, these tactics have failed to break Ukraine’s will to fight. Instead, they may have had the opposite effect, hardening Ukraine’s resolve and amplifying anti-Russian sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, the damage Russian missiles have inflicted across the country will likely weigh down Ukraine’s economic recovery and make additional foreign assistance critical to rebuilding. However, the continued provision of air defenses now will mitigate these future costs and reinforce a sense of security that could encourage Ukrainian refugees to return home. Such refugee repatriations will be important to Ukraine’s post-war economic recovery and future self-sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its struggle against Russian missile attacks, Ukraine has shown that, while dangerous, Russian missiles are not unstoppable. Even under harrowing circumstances, Ukraine has defeated advanced Russian cruise missiles with high-tech counters such as active air defenses and low-tech practices such as dispersion, mobility, deception, and camouflage. One cannot assume that Russia or others would repeat the same operational blunders in a future war. Still, Ukraine’s experience illustrates Russian theater missiles are not an unmanageable challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-missile-campaign-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Russia’s Missile Campaign in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The character of Russia’s missile attacks on Ukraine has evolved significantly since the start of the war. The first wave of strikes primarily targeted Ukrainian air bases, air defenses, and munitions depots. By around April 2022, Russia shifted its focus from military targets to Ukraine’s petroleum and transportation sectors, aiming to interdict the flow of foreign-supplied weapons to the front lines. The summer of 2022 saw an uptick in Russian missile attacks against civilians, including indiscriminate attacks on residential areas and targeted strikes against Ukraine’s agricultural sector. In September, Russia again escalated its attacks on Ukrainian civilians, kicking off a systemic missile and drone campaign to degrade Ukraine’s civil electrical grid and water facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shifts in objectives have not been steps in a preplanned military effort. Rather, they represent ad hoc adaptations driven by Russia’s frustrations over its broader war effort, its struggle to target mobile Ukrainian military assets, and the irregular availability of cruise missiles and other stand-off weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-opening-salvo&quot;&gt;The Opening Salvo&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first hours of its attack on Ukraine, Russia concentrated its air and guided-missile strikes against Ukrainian airfields and airports, with particular attention to on-site stores of aviation fuel. Russia also targeted air defense sites and major Ukrainian munitions depots (Appendix I). Moscow carried out around 160 air and missile strikes in the first two days of the war, with missiles striking “nearly 10” Ukrainian air bases, among other targets, according to U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) estimates at the time. Ukraine reported explosions at around 30 locations by 0900 on February 24. At the time, the Russian Ministry of Defense characterized these strikes as targeting “military infrastructure, air defense facilities, military airfields, and aviation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine” using “high-precision weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aggregate effect of these strikes was not immediately clear from open sources, but it soon became apparent that Russia was failing to gain air superiority over Ukraine. While Russia struck nearly all of Ukraine’s active air bases, much of the Ukrainian Air Force (UAF) survived the initial barrage and, despite being badly outnumbered and outclassed, made its presence felt in the days and weeks following the invasion. Ukrainian fighters persistently engaged Russian aircraft in the skies of Kyiv and elsewhere. Even on the first day of war, Ukrainian Su-24 bombers took part in the Battle of Hostomel airport, an early Ukrainian victory that set the tone for the early phases of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than two weeks into the war, the DOD assessed that the “Ukrainians still have at their disposal viable and effective air and missile defense, and they are still able to and are flying aircraft in that very contested airspace.” While Russia could gain dominance over some areas for periods, airspace control was shifting and heavily contested. In addition to the tactical advantages, the persistence of the UAF also proved a valuable symbol for national morale and resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important factor in these early days was the failure of Russian missile forces to suppress Ukraine’s contingent of Bayraktar TB-2 uncrewed aerial systems, which Ukraine likely also dispersed in advance of the invasion. Although Russia would eventually neutralize most of these systems through electronic warfare and air defenses, the TB-2s proved pivotal in the early weeks of the war, inflicting considerable damage to Russian forces. Video footage gathered by TB-2s circulated across social media sites, proving a powerful tool in publicizing Ukrainian military success to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia saw some initial success in disabling fixed Ukrainian air defense sites in the opening days of the war. A study from the Royal United Services Institute found that Russia managed to suppress Ukrainian air defense through air and missile strikes on static air defense targets, particularly Ukraine’s network of larger air surveillance radars. However, a significant portion of Ukraine’s mobile air defenses survived. Once reconstituted after the initial few days of the war, these units began inflicting high losses on Russian aircraft operating in Ukrainian airspace. By March, the Russian Air Force had largely abandoned penetrating sorties with manned aircraft, relying predominately on stand-off missiles for strike missions against strategic targets beyond the front lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another pivotal shortcoming in Russia’s opening salvo was its failure to decisively diminish Ukraine’s munitions stockpiles. According to one account, Russian missiles struck all of Ukraine’s national munitions depots in the first days of the war. However, Ukraine had already begun dispersing its munitions stores away from the centralized sites three days before the start of Russia’s invasion. Russia’s apparent inability to adapt its targeting to this dispersal enabled Ukraine to keep its artillery brigades well supplied with shells. Russian forces attempting to advance against Kyiv faced bombardment from Ukrainian artillery until they retreated from the Kyiv axis altogether in April 2022. Dispersal of artillery units in the days leading up to the invasion was also instrumental in ensuring the guns themselves survived the initial Russian air attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shifting-focus&quot;&gt;Shifting Focus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia abandoned its drive against Kyiv in April, Russia deemphasized targeting Ukraine’s military airfields and air defenses and refocused on economic and logistical targets. In addition to rail infrastructure and bridges, Russia targeted Ukraine’s petroleum industry to degrade its ability to produce fuel (Appendix II). This shift in focus likely stemmed from Russia’s realization that it was facing a protracted conflict and needed to stymie Ukraine’s mobility and supply lines. Neither line of effort appears to have achieved lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early April, Russia attacked Ukraine’s largest oil refineries, in Kremenchuk and Odesa. Local sources said Russian missiles had “completely destroyed” the Kremenchuk refinery, although Russia would go on to strike the facility again in May and June. Russia also reportedly struck the Shebelinsky gas processing plant in June, and missile strikes also damaged pipeline infrastructure. Together, these attacks effectively shut down Ukraine’s domestic production of refined petroleum products such as gasoline and likely contributed to a temporary gasoline shortage over the spring and summer of 2022. While this resulted in hardships among civilians, it did not discernably impair Ukraine’s military effort. Ukraine was already heavily dependent (more than 80 percent) on imports of refined petroleum products even before the war, and countries such as Lithuania were quick to step up their exports to Ukraine to meet the shortfall from Russian attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fdTajRW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Workers look at a power substation damaged following a missile strike in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on May 4, 2022, as Russia’s defense ministry said that its air- and sea-based weapons have destroyed six electrical substations near railways, including around Lviv.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also took aim at Ukraine’s transportation infrastructure in a bid to disrupt the flow of Western weapons to the front lines. On April 25, Russian missiles hit five railway junctions in a single day, with the Ukrainian General Staff assessing: “They [the Russians] are trying to destroy the ways of supplying military and technical assistance from partner states.” A week later, at least 18 Russian cruise missiles struck railway infrastructure across Ukraine, including damaging three electrical substations around Lviv powering the rail network in Western Ukraine. These attacks reportedly caused temporary delays to around 50 trains. Like previous efforts to achieve decisive strategic effects, Russian attacks against Ukraine’s transportation did not appear to have had a lasting impact. Even shortly after the strikes, a top executive of Ukraine’s rail services told journalists that “the longest delay we’ve had has been less than an hour.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;false-flags-punishment-and-psychological-warfare&quot;&gt;FALSE FLAGS, PUNISHMENT, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war, there have been multiple examples of Russia attempting to use missile attacks to shape public opinion in its favor or to psychologically influence the calculus of Ukraine’s leadership. These efforts have generally backfired. One incident was Russia’s ballistic missile attack on the Kramatorsk railway station, which killed nearly 60 civilians and wounded more than 100 others. In the attack, Russia employed older SS-21 Tochka-U ballistic missiles equipped with submunition warheads. The Tochka-U is the only ballistic missile system Russia and Ukraine possess in common, and in the wake of the attack, Russia pushed the narrative that Ukraine had carried out a false-flag attack to gain international sympathy. An independent investigation debunked these claims, however, confirming that Russia still had SS-21s in service in Ukraine and that the missile that struck Kramatorsk came from Russian-occupied territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/z43WCEI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ The remains of a rocket with the Russian lettering “for our children” painted on it is seen on the ground in the aftermath of a rocket attack on the railway station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk on April 8, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in March 2022, a Tochka-U missile with submunitions struck downtown Donetsk city, killing over 20 civilians. Unlike the Kramatorsk attack, this attack occurred inside Russian-occupied territory. Russian media presented the incident as a Ukrainian attack, an accusation that Ukraine denied, saying that the missile was of Russian origin. Neither version of the story has been fully confirmed, but the incident aligns with the pattern of Russian behavior since the start of the war. In October 2022, projectiles struck the Continent shopping mall in downtown Donetsk. Russian sources accused Ukraine of attacking the civilian structure with HIMARS rockets. Later, however, imagery emerged of debris from a Russian Kh-31 missile at the site of the blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war has turned against Russia, Moscow has also used its long-range missiles in operations meant to “punish” Ukraine in the wake of major Russian setbacks, an effort to deter Ukraine from its continued counterattacks. After Ukraine sank the Russian cruiser Moskva in April, Russia responded by firing up to five cruise missiles at the Vizar Zhulyansky Machine-Building Plant, a defense industrial complex outside of Kyiv. After the attack, Russia’s defense ministry declared that: “The number and scale of missile strikes on targets in Kyiv will increase in response to any terrorist attacks or acts of sabotage on Russian territory committed by the Kyiv nationalist regime.” In late June, Russia launched more than 60 missile strikes against cities across Ukraine over two days, possibly a response to the United States announcing it would send HIMARS to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;escalation-against-civilians&quot;&gt;Escalation against Civilians&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attacks on civilians have been a persistent feature of Russia’s war on Ukraine since the start of the conflict. But by the summer of 2022, there was a noticeable uptick in civilian attacks using long-range missiles (Appendix III). There has been a degree of uncertainty as to whether civilians were the intended target of these attacks or whether the loss of civilian life and destruction of civilian property has been a byproduct of inaccurate Russian missiles and poor targeting intelligence. Evidence is mixed, and it is likely that Russia has targeted Ukrainian civilians both intentionally and inadvertently. Whether purposeful or not, Russia’s strike campaign has shown an almost complete disregard for civilian safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elevated intensity of strikes against civilian targets around mid-summer 2022 coincided with reports that Russia was running low on its higher-end precision-guided missiles such as the 3M-14 and Kh-101, relying more heavily on missiles ill-suited for land-attack missions. This period included growing Russian use of anti-ship missiles in land-attack roles, such as the Kh-22. Missiles such as the Kh-22 have seekers able to home in on large ships at sea and struggle to discriminate between structures in dense urban environments. Kh-22s nevertheless have large warheads and have had devasting effects on civilian infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also began repurposing S-300 air defense interceptors to strike urban areas at this time. S-300 interceptors are also poorly suited for land attack as they rely on semi-active radar homing for terminal guidance. In a social media post, the governor of Mykolaiv Oblast, Vitaly Kim, noted that Russia had been upgrading its S-300 with satellite navigation, though their accuracy remained poor. Mykolaiv was hit uniquely hard by Russian S-300 barrages during the summer of 2022, with salvos of 9 to 12 missiles striking the city every few days during some periods. Commenting on Russia’s use of the S-300 in late July, UK intelligence assessed: “There is a high chance of these weapons missing their intended targets and causing civilian casualties because the missiles are not optimized for this role and their crews will have little training for such missions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s use of anti-ship missiles against urban centers has had similar outcomes. On June 27, Russia struck the city of Kremenchuk with Kh-22s. In Kremenchuk, one Kh-22 struck a road-paving equipment factory, while another hit a nearby shopping mall, killing 20 civilians and wounding more than 60 others. On July 1, three Russian Kh-22s struck the city of Odesa, demolishing a multi-story apartment complex and killing 22 civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toll that Russian missile strikes have taken on Ukrainian civilians cannot be solely attributed to low-quality munitions. Russia has, on numerous occasions, struck civilian targets with some of its most advanced and expensive weapons. On July 14, for example, three Russian submarine-launched 3M-14 Kalibr cruise missiles struck downtown Vinnytsia, hitting a shopping center, a wedding hall, and a dance studio, killing 23 civilians and wounding 71. Such strikes have led many to conclude that Russian strikes on civilians are intentional, not a byproduct of missile inaccuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0M28fWc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Fragments of a Russian cruise missile lie on the ground following a strike in the city of Vinnytsia on July 14, 2022, killing at least 23 people, including 3 children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This period also saw significant Russian targeting of Ukraine’s agricultural sector. To be sure, Russia’s military has sought to damage Ukraine’s agricultural industry since just after the start of the conflict. Yet as Russian troops withdrew from northern Ukraine, Russia continued to attack agricultural infrastructure with artillery and stand-off missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late August, reports surfaced that Russia had received shipments from Iran comprising “hundreds” of Iranian Shahed-series loitering munitions, sometimes referred to as “kamikaze” or one-way attack drones. By mid-September, UK intelligence had assessed that Russia had already deployed Shahed-136 drones, after Ukrainian forces reportedly shot one down on September 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By late September, Shahed-136 munitions began appearing in the skies over Odesa. In the following weeks, intense battles ensued between Ukrainian air defenses and Russian drones attacking civilian and military structures. Between September 25 and 29, Russia reportedly launched 29 kamikaze drone attacks against Odesa and other areas in southern Ukraine. By most accounts, Ukrainian air defenses destroyed a significant portion of Russia’s drone attacks. Some did get through, however, with Shahed-136 drones striking Odesa’s port area, several residential areas, and the headquarters of Ukraine’s Operational Command South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-autumn-blitz&quot;&gt;The Autumn Blitz&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian missile attacks on Ukraine entered a new phase shortly after Ukraine’s October 8 attack on the Kerch bridge connecting Crimea to Russia. On October 10, Russia launched over 100 missiles and loitering munitions at Ukraine, targeting Ukraine’s power grid, municipal water facilities, and related civilian infrastructure. This wave of attacks would become just the first in a systematic Russian effort to degrade Ukraine’s capacity to produce and deliver electrical power to its civilian population (Appendix IV).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YX0qMJy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Damaged equipment at a high-voltage substation of the operator Ukrenergo after a missile attack in central Ukraine on November 10, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first week of the renewed assault, Russian missiles and drones struck 405 locations across the country, including 45 power stations, representing approximately 30 percent of power stations across Ukraine. In a briefing on October 17, a senior DOD official described Russian actions as “targeting nonmilitary targets, innocent civilians, with no military value . . . to instill terror, and try to create panic, fear, with the idea that somehow this is going to decrease the resolve of the Ukrainian people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following days and weeks would see steady waves of missile and drone attacks of an intensity not seen since the conflict’s opening days. According to reports from the UAF, Russia fired over 600 air- and sea-launched cruise missiles between October 10 and the end of 2022, with an average salvo size of around 50 missiles. Interspersed with these cruise missile attacks have been waves of one-way attack drones, primarily Shahed-136s, of which Ukraine says Russia launched nearly 700 between September 2022 and early January 2023. Moreover, Russia has targeted civilian infrastructure with shorter-range missiles such as the S-300 in areas closer to the front lines, including Kherson and Mykolaiv. In mid-December, the United Nations assessed that Russia’s bombardment had damaged around 50 percent of Ukraine’s power grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that Ukraine has managed to forestall a complete collapse of its electrical grid. Independent measures of internet connectivity across Ukraine, a proxy measure for electricity supply, show the damage caused by Russia’s strikes but also Ukraine’s efforts to restore power. Data from the independent internet watchdog Netblocks, for example, shows a major drop in web connectivity during the first major wave of strikes against Ukraine’s grid between October 10 and 11, but also shows restoration of service in many areas (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observers measured similar outages corresponding to Russian missile attacks. Attacks on November 15 and 23 resulted in particularly acute losses in power as they also caused disruptions to the output from all three of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants still in operation. Ukrainian utilities have employed conservation efforts and scheduled rolling blackouts to ration what power they can still generate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-view-ahead&quot;&gt;The View Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of January 2023, Russian missile and drone attacks against electrical infrastructure have caused significant degradation of Ukraine’s grid. The system remains fragile, but Ukrainian air defense and utility workers have prevented a total grid collapse. As of mid-January, Ukraine’s main energy company, Ukenergo, said it could cover 75 percent of its electricity demand. Ukrainians face extreme hardship, but there appears to be little public support for offering concessions to Russia in exchange for peace. The growing capability of Ukrainian air defenses have likely forced Russia into making less frequent but more intense attacks to overwhelm defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The availability of Russian stand-off weapons will be a factor as well in the frequency and intensity of Russian attacks. Analysis of the wreckage of Kh-101s from the attacks on November 23 shows they were produced no earlier than September 2022. This indicates that Russia may be reaching the limits of its missile stockpiles and shifting toward greater reliance on newly manufactured missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia has truly exhausted its stockpiles, a slowdown in attacks could be on the horizon. Since October, Russia has expended more high-end precision missiles than most estimates suggest it can produce. Ukraine estimates that Russia has produced around 500 long-range cruise missiles since the start of the war, or around 40 to 50 per month. It is unclear whether Russia can sustain such production levels, considering that the impact of Western sanctions and export restrictions on component availability is murky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, Russian missile expenditure and production will have to reach an equilibrium at some point. If Russia cannot significantly increase production, it will have to decrease the frequency of its large missile attacks to perhaps one to two per month. Russia may continue to acquire and employ Iranian Shahed-136 drones, though very few of these appear to be getting through Ukrainian air defenses and therefore are unlikely to inflict considerable harm beyond draining Ukraine’s air defense capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the threat of a diminished Ukrainian air defense capacity is a great concern. Beyond intercepting cruise missiles and drones, Ukraine’s long-, medium-, and short-range defenses have, in concert, successfully stopped and deterred penetrating sorties by Russian aircraft. It is therefore critical that Ukraine maintains a layered air defense to prevent Russia from making use of its deep stockpiles of unguided gravity bombs. Should Russia manage to wear down Ukraine’s air defenses through attrition and gain air superiority, the war becomes significantly more challenging for Ukraine. To the extent possible, the replenishment of interceptors and related air defense equipment must remain a high priority for Western military aid packages for the foreseeable future. Sourcing will grow increasingly difficult, however, and will likely require ramping up production to maintain adequate inventories among U.S. and allied militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, stabilization schedules (SGS) are in effect. You can familiarize yourself with the schedule here. Take care and use electricity sparingly! We believe in victory.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another concern is if Russia is able to sustain air attacks against Ukraine’s electrical grid over the coming months or even years, even at a diminished frequency, it could eventually exhaust Ukraine’s capacity to sustain repairs. Ukraine’s grid is based on Soviet technology, for which there are few sources for spare parts and materials. In addition to continued air defense support, it will likely become necessary for Ukraine to transition its electrical infrastructure to a more sustainable configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It cannot be denied that Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and industry have deepened Ukraine’s dependency on the West. This growing dependency supports Russia’s hope that it can eventually exhaust the West’s patience and Western capitals will pressure Ukraine to make concessions. This Russian theory of victory will fail, however, unless Western governments accommodate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sources-of-underperformance&quot;&gt;Sources of Underperformance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of February 2023, Russia’s long-range strike campaign has fallen short of most of its strategic objectives. At the war’s outset, the Russian military failed to sufficiently degrade Ukraine’s air force and air defenses enough to sustain air superiority. Moscow struggled to disrupt Ukraine’s command and control apparatus and could not isolate its political leadership. Russian efforts to disrupt Ukrainian logistics through attacks on munitions depots and transportation infrastructure have not achieved lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There appears to be no single reason for these missteps. Instead, a confluence of factors explains the underperformance of Russia’s strike campaign. Among these are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s efforts to disperse its forces in advance of the initial wave of attacks and the inability of Russia’s targeting cycle to keep pace with a dynamic and shifting battlespace;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s inability to adequately scale its strike campaign to the volume of targets Ukraine has presented;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian air defenses and their increasing effectiveness in reducing damage from Russian missile salvos; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lower-than-expected reliability of Russian missiles may have also been a factor. However, this point is somewhat controversial as it is difficult to assess the extent to which Russian missiles have failed due to malfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, Russia began a brute-force effort to break the morale of Ukrainian civilians through long-range missile and drone attacks on electrical infrastructure. This operation’s myopic focus and persistence have resulted in major damage to Ukraine’s civil infrastructure. The current campaign’s target set of fixed assets fits better with Russian operational capabilities. Russian missile forces have struggled with mobile targets, but infrastructure is generally immovable and unhardened. Moreover, Ukraine’s civil infrastructure has changed little since the country gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and thus Russian intelligence on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure remains accurate. Whether these attacks will advance Russia’s aim to drive the Ukrainian government into trading concessions for peace remains to be seen, but if the history of strategic bombing of civilians is a guide, Russia’s current campaign is unlikely to achieve its political objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dispersal-of-forces-and-slow-russian-targeting-cycles&quot;&gt;Dispersal of Forces and Slow Russian Targeting Cycles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dispersal and mobility have been Ukraine’s best tools against Russia’s strike operations. Russia has seen some success against fixed targets, such as static air defense assets at the war’s outset, and more recently against fixed infrastructure, such as electrical substations. In general, the Russian military appears to have struggled to gather and disseminate targeting data quickly enough to keep pace with a dynamic battlespace. From the onset of the war, easily movable assets such as mobile air defenses, aircraft, and other maneuver forces have largely eluded Russia’s long-range air and missile attacks. Ukrainian officials have assessed that it can take the Russian military 48 hours or more between the acquisition of targeting intelligence and a strike, leaving adequate time for Ukrainian forces to shift locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apparent slowness of Russia’s targeting practices suggests that Russia may lack a targeting process nimble enough to quickly shift attack capability to high-priority targets or simply may lack the capacity to dedicate attack capability solely for time-sensitive targets. Russia may likewise lack a command and control process to rapidly direct changes in strike plans. UK intelligence similarly assessed that “Russia’s targeting processes are highly likely routinely undermined by dated intelligence, poor planning, and a top-down approach to operations.” Analysts from Royal United Services Institute also highlighted the effects of the Russian command structure’s inflexibility on its strike operations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It seems that those directing fire missions either do not have access to contextual information or are indifferent to it. In any case, observations of Russian pre-planned fires shows that they will strike targets that have moved and subsequently engage the same target in its new position, suggesting a purely chronological prioritization of activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such deficiencies have had a major impact on the course of the war. One clear example comes from the degree to which Ukraine’s small air force survived Russia’s initial aerial onslaught. In September, a top U.S. military commander estimated that around 80 percent of Ukraine’s air force remained intact. And while the UAF has taken losses in air-to-air combat, there is no evidence that Ukraine has lost significant numbers of operational combat aircraft on the ground. This achievement is due in no small way to dispersal actions that have complicated Russian targeting. Despite the small size of its air force, Ukraine has a significant number of air bases capable of receiving military aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this spare capacity may be due to the degradation of the UAF since 2014. But the UAF has been conscious of maintaining spare basing capacity. For instance, the UAF’s strategic plan published in 2020 noted that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In peacetime, in order to save resources, aviation should be based at 5-6 aviation bases, which will reduce operational costs. At the same time, to ensure operational maneuver, operational flexibility, and survivability, up to 15-20 operational airfields (aviation garrisons) should be sustained. These will be capable of receiving aircraft and helicopters immediately and ensuring their combat employment, allowing them to disperse aviation equipment to threatening axes during special periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dispersion and mobility were also crucial in enabling a decisive amount of Ukraine’s air defenses to survive Russian efforts to gain air superiority. While Russia may have destroyed as much as 75 percent of Ukraine’s fixed air defenses in its initial bombardment, Ukraine’s mobile, dispersible units largely survived. These forces have had an enormous impact in setting conditions for Ukraine’s military success so far. As of December 2022, Russia had lost at least 62 combat aircraft, mostly the work of mobile ground-based defenses. More importantly, though, the threat from Ukrainian air defenses has deterred the Russian Air Force from penetrating sorties into Ukraine’s airspace for most of the war, restricting Russia’s strategic strike campaign to a limited number of expensive stand-off missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;too-many-targets-too-few-missiles&quot;&gt;Too Many Targets, Too Few Missiles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has unleashed thousands of missiles upon Ukraine since February 2022. In many cases, it appears that Russian planners underestimated the amount of ordnance required to adequately suppress the facilities they targeted, particularly in the critical early days of the invasion. The sheer volume of individual targets within Ukraine likely strained Russia’s strike capacity. Ukrainian statistics of Russian missile strikes over the first five months of the war show a lower-than-expected density of strikes in areas of Ukraine rich in strategic military targets (Figure 5). Moreover, the time Russia allotted for its initial strike campaign was also far too short for what it hoped to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AgkbqHS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Russian Missile Strikes by Region, February 24 – July 21, 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Data set included 110 additional strikes with undetermined target region. Source: Data from Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian figures indicate as few as 20 Russian missile strikes in Vinnytsia Oblast between February 22 and July 21. This is an unexpectedly low number considering that Vinnytsia Oblast is home to numerous strategic facilities, including Ukraine’s Air Force Command Center and an important UAF weapons depot. It also contains Vinnytsia International Airport, a major Ukrainian military logistics hub, and is home to the 456th Guards Transport Aviation Brigade. The airport remained unscathed until Russia struck it with eight Kh-101 cruise missiles on March 6. Satellite imagery indicated that damage was limited to two air traffic control towers and a single parked aircraft, with no apparent damage to the runway. Russia did not strike the UAF command center until March 25, by which time it is unlikely the facility still served any critical wartime functions. Ukraine has also reported several missile attacks on civilian areas with no apparent strategic or military value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other strategic targets appeared to suffer only light-to-moderate damage early in the conflict, allowing Ukraine to disperse forces and reconstitute. Ozerne Air Base in Zhytomyr Oblast is a good example. At the start of the war, Ozerne was home to Ukraine’s 39th Tactical Aviation Brigade, which includes around 15 Su-27 multirole fighters, representing about 10 percent of Ukraine’s combat air power at the start of the war. Ozerne was struck by Russian missiles on the first day of the conflict, February 24. However, satellite imagery of Ozerne from February 27 showed signs of only seven impact points. Five of these strikes appear to have missed any vital assets. Two struck around the apron, destroying one parked Su-27 (one of two aircraft visible in the image). Other reports say that a fueling vehicle may have also been destroyed. The runway remained intact. Only two aircraft are visible in the image, likely indicating that the remaining aircraft had been dispersed to other bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apparent intensity of Russian missile attacks in these cases is well below similar operations conducted by the United States and its allies against similar targets. Over the first three days of its invasion of Ukraine, Russia launched around 250 cruise and ballistic missiles at targets across the entire territory of Ukraine. By comparison, the United States launched more than 420 sea- and air-launched cruise missiles against Iraq over 70 hours during Operation Desert Fox in 1998, an operation with vastly narrower objectives. Over the first 10 days of Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. and coalition forces delivered nearly 10,000 precision-guided munitions against Iraqi military targets. By day 10 of its invasion of Ukraine, Russia had launched under 1,000 precision strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of munitions Russia employed against individual targets is also significantly less than the United States has employed against similar targets. To the previous examples, reports indicate that the Russia struck the Ozerne and Vinnytsia Air Bases with no more than eight cruise missiles each (the loadout of a single Tu-95 bomber). In response to the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons in 2017, the United States struck a single Syrian air base with 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of strikes Russia carried out seems even less adequate when one considers the sheer volume of targets that Russia would have to suppress to gain air superiority over Ukraine. In addition to the number of air bases capable of servicing military aircraft, Ukraine had the largest ground-based air defense force in Europe at the start of the invasion. Estimates from 2021 indicated that Ukraine possessed over 300 mobile medium- to long-range air defense systems. Additionally, Ukraine had multiple static air defense radars and older interceptors, such as S-125 units, deployed across its territory. Even with timely intelligence, quickly disabling a large enough portion to gain control of the skies may simply have outstripped the capacity of Russia’s conventional strike complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time was also a factor. For an operation as large and complex as Russia’s invasion, Russian military planners gave its aerospace forces essentially no time to shape the battlespace prior to commencing its invasion. By comparison, U.S. operations against Iraq in 1991 and 2003 saw days to weeks of aerial bombardment before committing coalition ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ukrainian-air-defenses&quot;&gt;Ukrainian Air Defenses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another increasingly important factor contributing to Russia’s underperformance has been the ability of Ukrainian air defenses to intercept Russian missiles and other guided munitions in flight. The UAF, which operates much of Ukraine’s long-range air defense systems, regularly reports on air defense activity. Although difficult to verify, the number of reported intercepts has significantly increased since Russia began systematically targeting civilian power facilities on October 10 (Figure 6). This increase is on one hand a function of the relatively greater volume of missiles Russia is firing into Ukraine but is also likely due to the introduction of Western air defense systems since the fall of 2022. Data shows not just an increase in the gross number of intercepts but in the proportion of salvos that Ukraine reports to shoot down (Figure 7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r6OUMwz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Reported Cruise Missile Intercepts (Cumulative).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Data from General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backbone of Ukraine’s air defense force at the start of the war was its mobile SA-8, SA-10, and SA-11 units, most of which survived the opening salvo of Russia’s strike campaign. Since then, this layered defense has provided a potent deterrent against Russian aircraft making penetrating sorties into Ukrainian airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Videos and images of cruise missile intercepts in Ukraine have been rare, but this lack of video or photo evidence of cruise missile intercepts is an unreliable indicator of Ukrainian air defense performance against cruise missiles. The speed and suddenness of air defense engagements make documenting the events challenging. The Ukrainian government also discourages its citizens from posting about air defense activity for operational security reasons. There have, however, been enough documented incidents of cruise missile intercepts to confirm that Ukrainian air defenses are actively engaging Russian cruise missiles and are seeing some success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. defense officials have also lent additional credence to Ukrainian reports by confirming that Ukraine has successfully stopped at least some Russian cruise missiles. In October, a senior defense official said that between October 10 and 11, Ukraine intercepted 40 to 50 percent of the 80 Russian cruise missiles and drones fired at its territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NrE16Tb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Ukrainian BUK-M1 medium-range surface-to-air missile system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers published by the UAF show that its air defenses are intercepting an increasingly large proportion of Russian cruise missile salvos since October. Moreover, the intercept ratios Ukrainian air defenders achieved in the latter months of 2022 were markedly greater than during the first several months of the war. Between February and July, Ukraine reported intercepting 174 cruise missiles, just over 10 percent of Russia’s reported 1,500 cruise missiles fired into Ukraine by that point. By December 2022, Ukraine reported intercepting 75 to 80 percent of incoming Russian cruise missiles on average (Figure 7). On November 15, Ukraine claimed to stop 75 cruise missiles in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EBOX9G1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ German-made IRIS-T surface-to-air missile system in Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This growth is likely attributable to several factors. While difficult to measure, the growing experience and skill of Ukraine’s air defenders is very likely an important factor. Moreover, Russia’s almost singular focus on electrical infrastructure since October has also made its targeting more predictable, allowing Ukraine to optimally posture its air defense assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1jXxsDs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increase in reported intercepts also roughly correlates to the arrival of Western-made air defenses such as IRIS-T, NASAMS, and Aspide. Ukrainian leaders have stated that the IRIS-T system has succeeded in 90 percent of engagements. In November, U.S. secretary of defense Lloyd Austin said that NASAMS had achieved a 100 percent success rate. These systems, however, are not yet widespread in Ukraine, and legacy systems such as the S-300 likely remain the workhorses of Ukraine’s air defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/46eN3Of.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Damage from air defense interceptor on body of downed 3M-14 Kalibr cruise missile, June 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the longer-range systems such as NASAMS, Ukraine has also highlighted its successful employment of shorter-range missile and gun-based systems, such as the German-made Gepard. The Gepard features two 35-mm Flak cannons and a radar mounted on a tracked chassis. Systems such as the Gepard are playing an important role in engaging slower-moving targets such as Shahed-136 drones, allowing Ukrainian air defenders to preserve their limited supply of surface-to-air missiles for faster, more challenging targets. Still, some observers have credited the Gepard with destroying higher-end targets, including cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A profile from Ukrainian defense media highlighted the role of mobile fire groups equipped with man-portable air defense weapons (MANPADS) such as Igla and Stinger missiles, crediting them with downing an undisclosed number of cruise missiles. These groups reportedly operate across the country, dispatched to interdict missiles and other aerial targets as they are detected. Several videos of MANPADS intercepting cruise missiles have surfaced on social media, indicating that the UAF is seeing some success with this tactic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/76bJxqX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Ukrainian soldier Igor, who reportedly shot down a Russian cruise missile with a man-portable air defense system in the Lviv region on October 10, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet challenges lie ahead. For Ukraine to sustain this apparent success, it will require continued Western support. The high volume of air defense activity has no doubt strained the capacity of Ukrainian air defenses, and Russian tactics appear to be aimed precisely to drain Ukraine’s defense capacity. Russia has reportedly been disarming some of its nuclear Kh-55 cruise missiles and firing them into Ukraine with ballast payloads to absorb air defense fire. Russia has also sought to maximize air defense attrition by launching mixed salvos of high-end cruise missiles and inexpensive drones. In some cases, Russia has used drones as pathfinders, probing for gaps and absorbing fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of cheaper air defense systems, such as gun-based weapons, has helped Ukraine mount a more efficient defense against low-end threats. But Russia’s mixed salvos present a complex battle management problem. Ukraine’s set of Russian and Western air defenses, old and new, lack an integrated battlement management system. Ukrainian air defenders are instead likely relying on wireless communications and “swivel chair integration” to build a common air picture and coordinate engagements. Under these conditions, a certain number of suboptimal exchanges and interceptor wastage is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AUx2sdh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A Flakpanzer Gepard antiaircraft gun (vehicle seen in image) shoots down a Russian cruise missile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consideration for Ukraine is balancing the air defense needs of civilian infrastructure with the need to protect its troops on the front lines from aerial attacks. Ukrainian air defenses along the front lines face a similar or even greater pace of activity. Russian attack aircraft and helicopters operate along the front lines daily, and the UAF regularly reports downing Russian aircraft and helicopters, including 14 Su-24 and Su-25 attack aircraft in 2022. Should Ukraine’s air defenses wither over the coming year, this balancing act becomes harder, increasing the vulnerability of Ukrainian troops to air attack, which could even reverse the momentum of the war in Russia’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9PkGJyK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine shifts toward greater reliance on Western systems, it will become increasingly dependent on Western military aid to replenish stocks of interceptors and other related munitions and equipment. Ukraine faces two main aerial threats: (1) the acute threat of Russian missiles and drones, and (2) the latent threat of the Russian Air Force resuming penetrating sorties into Ukrainian airspace. Consistent Western support over 2023 and beyond will be necessary for Ukraine to manage both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;accuracy-and-reliability&quot;&gt;Accuracy and Reliability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war, there has been speculation that Russian missiles have experienced higher-than-expected failure rates and lower-than-expected accuracy. The evidence is mixed and inconclusive on this point, however. In March 2022, news media quoted a U.S. official saying that U.S. intelligence had assessed that some types of Russian missiles were seeing failure rates of up to 60 percent and that Russia’s air-launched cruise missiles were particularly affected. Also in March, a DOD official told reporters that Russia had suffered a “not-insignificant number of failures” of cruise missiles. “Either they’re failing to launch, or they’re failing to hit the target, or they’re failing to explode on contact,” the official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little imagery has surfaced of Russian cruise missiles that failed to detonate, so it is difficult to corroborate this point with open-source evidence. There has been a steady amount of visual evidence showing Russian cruise missiles crashing before reaching their targets. Yet all missile systems will experience a certain failure rate, so evidence of crashed cruise missiles does not necessarily indicate systemic problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been speculation that Russian missiles have proven less accurate than previously thought. There have been instances of Russian missiles missing targets, such as the satellite image of the aftermath of a missile strike on the Ozerne air base where most missiles failed to hit any base structures. In other instances, Russian missiles visibly struck targets, including air traffic control towers and radar sites, with some precision. The most recent phase of Russia’s strike campaign, its attack on Ukraine’s electrical grid, suggests that Russian cruise missiles are capable of precise attacks. Satellite imagery and social media posts show clear evidence that Russian missiles are effectively hitting and damaging Ukraine’s electrical infrastructure. Furthermore, Russia is seeing this success despite having its salvos significantly thinned out by Ukrainian air defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Russia has employed hundreds of projectiles with poor accuracy in land-attack roles, such as Kh-22 anti-ship missiles and S-300 interceptors. These weapons have largely been limited to area attacks or indiscriminate terror attacks on civilians. But among the vanguard of Russia’s precision-guided munitions, such as the Kh-101 and 3M-14 Kalibr, the picture emerging from Ukraine is that these weapons, while perhaps not always reliably accurate, are not reliably inaccurate either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-russia-is-using&quot;&gt;What Russia Is Using&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February 2022, Russian armed forces have employed well over 5,000 missiles and one-way attack drones against Ukraine and nearly every known type of conventional missile in their arsenal. According to various data sets from the Ukrainian government, most of these projectiles have been air-launched, with smaller proportions fired from ground- and sea-based platforms. Comparing earlier and later data sets suggests that Russia leaned more heavily on its ground- and sea-based strike systems in the latter half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has expended much of its pre-war stockpile of precision-guided missiles. Shortages of modern missiles have forced Russia to reach deeper into its stocks of older missiles or to repurpose anti-ship missiles and air defense interceptors for land-attack roles. Still, Russia continues to use more modern missile variants such as the Kh-101 and 3M-14 Kalibr, indicating that it maintains some quantity in reserve and that newly manufactured missiles are making their way into the theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air-launched missiles represent the largest and most diverse portion of Russian missiles used in Ukraine, comprising a mix of long- and short-range air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) and a variety of shorter-range air-to-surface rockets. Data from the Ukrainian government indicates that Russia fired over 2,700 air-launched missiles during the first five months of the war. Of these, roughly half came from aircraft outside of Ukrainian airspace, suggesting that the remaining missiles were likely shorter-range projectiles supporting close air support operations around the front lines in Luhansk, Donetsk, and Kharkiv (Figure 12). This assessment would track with comments by DOD officials in May 2022. Following Russia’s withdrawal from the Kyiv axis, the Russian Air Force increased its activity to over 300 sorties per day, focusing on Donbas. Since July 2022, Russian long-range strikes have continued to come predominately from aircraft, namely from Tu-95 and Tu-160 strategic bombers operating around the Caspian Sea and Rostov regions, though the proportion of ground-launched weapons has increased, owing to Russia’s significant use of the S-300 for land attack and likely an increased use of the Iskander system (Figures 10 and 11).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LONG-RANGE ALCMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most frequently used long-range cruise missiles in the war have been the Kh-101 and Kh-555 ALCMs. The Kh-101 is a relatively new missile introduced in 2012 that employs satellite navigation. The older Kh-555 is a conventional variant of the nuclear-armed Kh-55 ALCM. The Russian Air Force has launched both Kh-101s and Kh-555s into Ukraine from Tu-95 and Tu-160 heavy bombers outside of Ukrainian airspace, often as far away as the Caspian Sea (Figure 12). In the past, Russia has referred to the Kh-101 as having stealthy attributes. Ukraine has reported shooting down an increasingly large portion of Kh-101 salvos, putting the purported low observability of the missile into question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tlEjjHc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has assessed that Russia has fired over 600 Kh-101 and Kh-555 missiles combined since the war began. This total may include a number of disarmed Kh-55 missiles, whereby the nuclear warhead was removed and replaced with ballast. Such a practice could serve to stretch a dwindling supply of precision-guided missiles and divert fire from air defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIR-TO-SURFACE MISSILES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also launched a significant number of air-to-surface guided missiles. These weapons are distinct from cruise missiles in that they are typically smaller, shorter ranged (≤300 km), and often employ a rocket engine instead of a jet engine as their primary propulsion (though there are exceptions). They are also generally launched from tactical aircraft such as the Su-24 or Su-25 rather than strategic bombers. Examples of missiles within this category include variants of the Kh-59, Kh-58, Kh-31, and Kh-29.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government’s numbers on Russian missile attacks through July 21 may also include some uses of closer-range air-to-surface rockets fired from Russian close air support aircraft such as the Su-24 and Su-25, typically with ranges below 10 km. The heaviest of these include the Kh-25 (AS-10), a family of missiles with numerous variants that feature a variety of guidance systems, including satellite navigation, TV-homing, and infrared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also employed some close-range guided missiles such as the helicopter-launched LMUR, a relatively new anti-armor munition equipped with an electro-optical seeker. Despite its intended anti-tank function, many of the missile’s purported uses in Ukraine have been against fixed targets such as warehouses, pontoon bridges, and other fixed structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/spBXMIk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Russian Kh-22 missile next to a Tu-22 bomber.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-radiation Missiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this group are two types of anti-radiation missiles (ARMs), the Kh-58 and Kh-31P. ARMs have special seekers that home in on radar emissions, making them useful for suppressing or destroying air defenses. Russia has used them throughout the war, including on the opening day of the war, where debris from a Kh-31P ARM crashed into a residential area of Kyiv. Ukraine reported tracking 35 ARM launches through July 2022. Senior sources in the UAF have reported losing “a number” of mobile 9K33 Osa and 9K37 Buk units to Russian KH-58 and Kh-31P missiles during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-ship Missiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By early summer of 2022, Russia had begun repurposing its stockpile of Kh-22 and Kh-32 air-launched anti-ship missiles for land-attack missions. Developed in the 1960s, the Kh-22 was the Soviet Union’s original “carrier-killer” missile, intended to sink large NATO capital ships. Fired from a Tu-22 bomber, the missile is large, delivering an explosive payload of over 900 kg to a range of around 600 km at supersonic speeds. The Kh-22 uses an active radar seeker for terminal guidance, a system with questionable accuracy when used in cluttered urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kh-32 is a modernized version of the Kh-22. Introduced in 2016, the Kh-32 is nearly physically identical to the Kh-22 but has reduced payload size and an active radar seeker that is reportedly more resistant to jamming. Due to its physical similarity with the Kh-22, it was initially unclear whether Russia was also expending Kh-32 missiles against land targets in Ukraine, though Russian state media appeared to confirm its use in November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine estimates that Russia fired just over 200 Kh-22/32 missiles in 2022. Russia has used the missiles in several high-casualty attacks against civilians. These include a strike on a shopping mall in Kremenchuk in June 2022 which killed at least 20 people, attacks on residential buildings in Odesa that killed more than 20, and a direct strike on an apartment building in Dnipro in January 2023 that killed nearly 50 people. Ukraine has admitted it is unable to intercept the missile with its current air defense systems. This is likely due to the missile’s speed and high flight altitude as well as a flight profile that is more like an aero-ballistic missile than a traditional, sea-skimming anti-ship missile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AFCmNAh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image25&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Wreckage from 3M-14 Kalibr cruise missile, June 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aero-Ballistic Missiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has also seen the first use of the Kh-47 Kinzhal aero-ballistic missile, which Russia describes as a hypersonic missile. Kinzhal is a modified 9K720 Iskander ballistic missile launched from a MiG-31K fighter. Russia has reportedly fired Kinzhal missiles on three occasions, and Ukraine estimates that Russia used 10 Kh-47s in 2022. The first use occurred in late March 2022, when Russia reportedly targeted a storage facility in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. Subsequent Kinzhal strikes may have occurred in April and May in Donbas and Odesa, respectively. Russia’s sporadic use of the Kinzhal against fixed targets has had little impact on the course of the war. Nevertheless, it has garnered significant attention from the media, prompting comments from senior officials, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and President Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sea-launched&quot;&gt;Sea-Launched&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian surface ships and submarines have frequently launched 3M-14 Kalibr cruise missiles at Ukraine from the Black and Caspian Seas. These missiles range up to 2,500 km, and Russia has used them against military and infrastructure targets deep in Ukrainian territory, such as airfields. There has nevertheless been significant use of 3M-14s against civilian targets, such as the July attack on a Vinnytsia shopping center and on residential areas in Odesa—strikes of no discernable military value and thus questionable expenditures of some of Russia’s most capable and expensive precision-guided missiles. Since October 2020, 3M-14 Kalibr missiles have had a large role in Russia’s strike campaign against Ukraine’s electrical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government has assessed that Russia launched just under 600 Kalibr missiles in 2022. The 3M-14 appears to have performed relatively reliably, though there have been some documented mechanical failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ground-launched&quot;&gt;Ground-Launched&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Short-Range Ballistic Missiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ballistic missile Russia has used most frequently in the war has been the 9M723 short-ranged ballistic missile (SRBM), commonly called the Iskander. It has a range of around 500 km and can deliver a large payload of up to 700 kg. The data on the quantity of 9M723s employed during the war is murky. Early Ukrainian data through July accounted for 124 Iskander launches. A later data set released by Ukraine’s defense minister in January 2023 assessed that Russia had launched nearly 750, suggesting that Russia significantly expanded its use of SRBMs between July and January. Russia may have increased its use of ballistic missiles during its late summer offensives in Donbas to attack military targets closer to the front lines. As an army asset, the Iskander complex is likely to be more integrated with ground operations than the long-range strike platforms operated by Russia’s air force or navy. Overall, the 9M723 has shown to be an accurate and reliable missile and has been an exception in that the Russian army has successfully used it in over-the-horizon strikes on mobile targets, albeit over a limited geographic area in which it can field significant quantities of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also employed the shorter-range Tochka-U. The Tochka-U can carry a unitary warhead, but it is most often observed employing submunitions. Ukraine claims that Russia fired more than 60 Tochka-Us between February and July 2022. The Tochka-U is the only ballistic missile system Russia and Ukraine deploy in common. Russian state media has nevertheless tried to assert that Russia no longer fields Tochka-U missiles in Ukraine and has tried to blame Ukraine for Tochka-U strikes on civilian targets. However, independent researchers have debunked these claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9M727/9M728 Ground-Launched Cruise Missile (GLCM)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 9M727 and 9M728 are GLCMs fired from the 9K720 Iskander-M launcher. Their range is around 500 km, like its ballistic missile counterpart. It is unclear what distinguishes the two variants, though some speculate the 9M727 may simply be an older version of the 9M728. The early part of the conflict saw little evidence of widespread use, but imagery of the missiles has surfaced since, confirming it has played a role in Russian strike operations. Ukrainian data from January 2023 estimated that Russia had only fired 68 9M727/9M728 missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P-800 Oniks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more notable Russian practices during the war has been its repurposing of anti-ship and air defense missiles for land-attack missions. The earliest instances of this activity began in late March 2022, with strikes in the Odesa region using P-800 Oniks anti-ship missiles reconfigured for land attack. The P-800 is a supersonic missile with an active radar seeker designed to attack heavily defended warships. Their use against static targets raised suspicions that Russia was running low on other precision-guided munitions more fit for purpose. The war in Ukraine is not the first time that Russia had employed the P-800 in a land-attack role, however, as Russia first used the weapon against ground targets in Syria in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since April, Russia has regularly used P-800s against Ukraine, with Ukraine reportedly intercepting two Oniks missiles in late December. Ukraine estimates that Russia launched just under 150 Oniks missiles in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;S-300&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S-300 is a long-range air defense system. As Russia’s stores of long-range missiles have dwindled, it has begun using S-300 interceptors in surface-to-surface mode for land attack. These munitions have relatively small warheads (most around 150 kg) and use semi-active radar for terminal homing, making them ill-suited for precision attacks or for use against hardened structures. As such, Russia has used them mostly for what appear to be indiscriminate attacks against civilian areas. The city of Mykolaiv in particular reported frequent S-300 barrages through the summer and fall of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike its long-range cruise missile stockpiles, Russia’s supply of air defense interceptors is deep—Russia’s military complex possesses well over 500 S-300 launchers, and Ukraine estimates Russia could have a stockpile of 8,000 interceptors at its disposal. According to Ukraine’s defense ministry, Russia has fired over 1,000 S-300 interceptors against land targets in Ukraine. The bulk of these missiles used in surface-to-surface attacks have likely been the older 5V5KK, which has an estimated strike range of around 120 km. In January 2023, however, Russia reportedly fired longer-range 48N6 interceptor variants at Kyiv for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foreign-sourced-munitions&quot;&gt;Foreign-Sourced Munitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One significant development has been Russia’s increasing reliance on foreign-sourced munitions. Notably, Russia has widely employed Iranian-manufactured “kamikaze” drones—loitering munitions with limited battlefield utility. Since mid-2022, Iran has provided Russia with hundreds of Shahed-136 drones. Cheap and easy to manufacture, the Shahed-136 is a delta-wing pusher prop drone that has provided Russia with a means of sustaining attacks behind the front lines against civilian infrastructure, forcing the expenditure of Ukrainian air defense capacity. Iran claims the munitions can fly up to 2,500 km, on par with the reach of Russia’s longest-range cruise missiles. Independent analysts, however, have suggested its real reach could be far lower, though the drones have been observed flying up to 1,000 km to reach their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the Shahed-136 has significant performance drawbacks which make it a poor stand-in for Russia’s stand-off weapons. It delivers no greater than 50 kg of high explosives to a target, just around 10 percent of the payload capacity of 3M-14 and Kh-101 cruise missiles. The drone is also much slower than a traditional turbofan-powered cruise missile, with a unique (and loud) acoustic signature, making it relatively easy prey for Ukrainian air defenses. Ukraine’s Air Force Command claims to have shot down nearly 500 Shahed-136 drones since their introduction to the battlespace in September 2022. Nevertheless, Russia’s widespread use of these cheap munitions forces Ukraine to expend valuable air defense capacity, which is likely among Russia’s primary goals in continuing to use them. Table-1 provides a comparison of Russian cruise missiles and the Shahed-136.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ITPIhFI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image26&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POTENTIAL FUTURE IMPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been reports that Russia is seeking to import Iranian ballistic missiles. These reports likely refer to Iran’s Fateh series, which includes the Fateh-313 and Zolfaghar missiles, solid-fueled SRBMs that Iran used to attack U.S. troops in Iraq in January 2020. Introducing Fateh-series missiles into the Ukraine conflict would complicate Ukrainian air defense efforts, as Ukraine possesses little to no ballistic missile defense capability. This will change with the transfer of Patriot batteries, which could potentially provide some defense. Still, the defended area of a single Patriot battery is relatively small, and most of the country will remain vulnerable. Nevertheless, the accuracy of Fateh missiles is questionable, and Russia would likely require a large salvo to reliably strike a small target such as an electrical substation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report reviewed Russia’s use of air and missile weapons in Ukraine from three perspectives: what capabilities Russia has used, how Russia used those capabilities, and why the results have failed to live up to Moscow’s expectations. Ukraine’s proactive dispersal of its air defenses and other vulnerable assets in the days leading up to the invasion are central to explaining why Moscow’s strategic strike campaign has not achieved its objective of achieving air superiority or compelling the Ukrainians to negotiate an end to the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dispersal disrupted the Russian military’s targeting cycle enough that it missed its opportunity to decisively shape the battlespace, a misstep from which Russia has yet to fully recover. Ukraine had enough surviving air defenses to attrite and eventually deter the Russian Air Force from penetrating its airspace, forcing Russia to depend on irregular, dwindling stocks of long-range missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Russian missile forces have shifted away from efforts to degrade Ukraine’s military capacity toward a campaign to degrade the Ukrainian people’s will to fight. Russian attacks have killed thousands of innocent civilians and severely damaged Ukraine’s economic and civil infrastructure. But while Russia has arguably seen greater operational success in this endeavor, it has deepened its strategic failures by stiffening Ukraine’s resolve rather than undermining it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous lessons the United States and its allies can take from Ukraine’s ongoing fight. The first is that ballistic and cruise missiles are not an intractable threat: they can be successfully countered through low- and high-tech means. Ukraine has demonstrated that cruise missile defense through ground-based air defenses is viable, but also that the use of mobility and deception can be just as effective as sophisticated interceptors in blunting missile attacks. Fixed air defense platforms are highly vulnerable unless they themselves are defended. Passive defenses—such as hardening, dispersion, and consequence management—can greatly mitigate the effects of air and missile attacks. Ukraine has demonstrated that Russian theater missiles are a manageable threat, but one that must be managed nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether Russia will persist in its current line of attack on Ukraine’s electrical grid or if it will again shift to a new approach. Much may depend on the flow of events on the front lines, the availability of munitions, and the ability of Russian industry to continue producing missiles. Enormous uncertainties remain, but Ukraine will certainly face new challenges in the year to come, requiring it and its partner nations to stay adaptable and committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendices&quot;&gt;Appendices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following appendices are selected lists of Russian missile strikes from February 2022 through January 2023. They are divided to roughly correspond with the four distinct “phases” of Russia’s strategic strike campaign as described in Chapter 1 of this report. These lists are far from exhaustive and represent only a small fraction of Russian missile activity in the Ukraine war. They nevertheless provide illustrative examples showing the nature of Russian strike operations as the war has progressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damage to targets indicated should not be considered exhaustive and is limited to what can be visually confirmed or described by credible sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sE1WCx7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第52天。第三名控方證人、時任民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟今開始作供，供稱時任召集人趙家賢曾望民主動力在2020年立法會換屆選舉「有角色」，但「冇乜人睬佢」；而鍾和趙同年2月與戴耀廷會面，戴表示就選舉協調已聯絡相當數量的民主派及一些資訊科技人士，但欠一個註冊團體和銀行戶口執行計劃，望民主動力可協助，鍾稱會面後遂有共識，民動會協助戴所領導的初選或協調。趙家賢早前強調民主動力於5月初獲邀請，5月中下旬才正式答應承辦初選，法官問民動是否於5月獲正式委任辦初選，鍾指對該說法「唔係太清楚」，「所以冇其他嘢可以協助到法庭。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，時任西貢區議會主席的鍾錦麟亦獲戴耀廷聯絡主持新界東協調會議，他指首次會議討論採取「初選」或「棄選」方案，及目標出選議席數量，但無印象有人提及戴耀廷的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方由署理助理刑事檢控專員（特別職務）羅天瑋負責提問。就鍾的個人背景，鍾確認其英文名字是「Ben」，指「雖然依個唔喺我身分證上面，但係大家都係咁樣稱呼我」，而鍾1988年於香港出生，2020年時33歲，已婚，獲文化研究學士及社會工作碩士學位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意，他自小對政治有興趣，12歲時已成為時任民主黨范國威的義工，而他19歲加入民主黨，加入不久後便退出，並在約2010年加入新民主同盟，范國威曾任該組織輪任召集人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱約於2013年認識戴耀廷朋友介紹認識區諾軒曾向趙家賢請教地區工作技巧&quot;&gt;鍾稱約於2013年認識戴耀廷、朋友介紹認識區諾軒、曾向趙家賢請教地區工作技巧&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾同意，於2011年當選西貢區議員，2019年成功連任，並獲選為西貢區議會主席，至2020年已有10年區議員經驗。鍾曾聽聞和知悉戴耀廷推動的「雷動計劃」和「風雲計劃」，被問是否認識戴耀廷，鍾指約於中學時開始看法律相關書籍，許多關於憲制的概念都是由戴撰寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡打斷問控方是否想問鍾個人是否認識戴，羅天瑋遂改問鍾任區議員時是否認識戴。鍾確認，指戴約於2012、2013年提出「佔領中環」行動前，曾發起很多「商討日」，他在商討日經人介紹後與戴「互相打咗聲招呼」，但沒有特別再商討任何事情。鍾續指，佔領運動後沒再與戴特別聯絡，但在2015、2016年左右戴在其他場合有與他不定期聯絡，二人並於戴2016年開始提倡「風雲計劃」時討論區議會選舉事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於同被指為組織者的區諾軒和趙家賢，鍾表示於2009、2010年區諾軒申請加入民主黨時，經朋友介紹認識區，之後有與區接觸。而他約於2007、2008年認識趙家賢，因鍾當時已立志參與2011年區選，而趙是當年區選最年輕的當選人，故向趙請教地區工作的技巧，趙並建議他修讀調解課程，指對地區工作「好有幫助」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾表示，於2014、2015年左右加入民主動力，其後成為民動副召集人。羅天瑋其後展示鍾的 Facebook 專頁，他確認是他作為議員向公眾發布訊息的專頁。羅一度問公眾如何能載入其專頁，余慧明面露驚訝，鄒家成亦發笑，鍾指若有人搜尋他的名字就相當可能找到該專頁，其宣傳品等亦有相關網址。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱民主動力曾嘗試協調2020年立會選舉-但實際由戴耀廷主導&quot;&gt;鍾稱民主動力曾嘗試協調2020年立會選舉 但實際由戴耀廷主導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據民主動力 Facebook，民動使命包括協調參與立法會選舉及區議會選舉。被問民主動力有否參與協調2020年立法會選舉，鍾指在2020年1、2月時「曾經嘗試去做協調，但係實際最後係由戴耀廷主導咗成個協調嘅程序」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指即與「35+計劃」無關，鍾同意，並問法庭是否容許他用「少少時間」講述民主動力當時望協調立會選舉的背景。李運騰問是否需要，控方指只需很簡單的背景。鍾其後在法官追問下，指「民主動力曾經嘗試協調『35+計劃』以外嘅協調」，並同意民主動力在戴耀廷的「35+計劃」以外，原本另有協調計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱2020年2月和趙家賢與戴耀廷會面談協調-戴稱已聯絡不同民主派望眾籌初選費用&quot;&gt;鍾稱2020年2月和趙家賢與戴耀廷會面談協調 戴稱已聯絡不同民主派、望眾籌初選費用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問及民主動力與戴耀廷的討論，鍾錦麟指，「趙家賢曾經希望民主動力可以協調到，或者當年嘅換屆選舉有角色，但係冇乜人睬佢」，陳志全發笑。鍾並指，民動另一位副召集人馮志活知道此情況後，亦知道區諾軒與戴耀廷正進行「非常之類近嘅工作」，即游說不同民主派人士進行選舉協調，便安排鍾錦麟、趙家賢和戴耀廷會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾表示，3人於2020年2月左右在太古城東隅酒店一所餐廳會面，會上戴耀廷提及因民主派在2019年區議會選舉大勝，認為「數字上面民主派係能夠攞到立法會過半席位」，故望進行協調工作，並表示已聯絡到相當數量的不同光譜民主派人士進行協調或初選，但沒有詳細描述或提及是什麼人或政黨。戴亦指已聯絡了一些「IT人」（資訊科技人士）設計初選流程，甚至望該初選程式可乘機做認證，不同選區的選民可獲發一個數碼代幣（token），除了在是次初選使用，亦可在日後社區議題上做決策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾亦指，戴建議以眾籌籌得初選所需經費，但他與趙家賢有相當保留，認為應由參與初選或協調的人攤分所有相關開支，以控制成本，避免不同光譜的參選人士提出越來越多要求。惟戴擔心素人會認為此做法即要他們負擔很高昂的費用、覺得這是由大黨壟斷的制度，故認為眾籌較可取，亦對此「非常之有信心」。鍾指民動沒有反對戴的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱2020年2月民主動力已有共識-協助戴耀廷領導的協調&quot;&gt;鍾稱2020年2月民主動力已有共識 協助戴耀廷領導的協調&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問戴有否提及協調時的困難，鍾指戴會上提到「好多嘅無論聯絡候選人、或者實際執行方法上面都已經係準備好㗎啦，但係佢冇一個註冊嘅團體同埋相關嘅銀行戶口去執行相關嘅計劃，所以希望民主動力可以協助」，並指「呢個見面就有共識，民主動力會協助戴耀廷所領導嘅初選或者協調」，林卓廷點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢早前強調民主動力於2月獲邀列席協調會議，5月初獲戴耀廷及區諾軒邀請承辦初選，至5月中下旬才正式答應。法官陳慶偉問，所以在2020年2月已有此共識？鍾答「正確」。陳再問那在2020年5月，民主動力是否獲正式委任？鍾表示：「對於法官呢個講法我唔係太清楚，所以冇其他嘢可以協助到法庭」，林卓廷發笑。陳再指，正式委任即是有白紙黑字，鍾回應「我對一啲明文嘅協議並唔知情」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋續問，戴耀廷有否提及希望民主動力如何幫忙。陳慶偉指不認為需問到這麼仔細，指這並非本案重點。羅改問誰代表民主動力與戴耀廷聯絡，鍾指是趙家賢，而時任民主動力總幹事黎敬輝有協助趙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾稱獲戴耀廷聯絡主持新東會議-何桂藍鄒家成等出席&quot;&gt;鍾稱獲戴耀廷聯絡主持新東會議 何桂藍、鄒家成等出席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟續指，戴認為不同地區選舉的協調，「應該係由唔同選區嘅區議會主席去協助」，故戴3月左右聯絡他，望幫手主持新界東協調會議，戴亦有聯絡時任沙田區議會主席程張迎。鍾一度指，「我喺度需唔需要停一停，定我驚時序上一路講到7月會好亂」，羅天瑋指會繼續問此議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;新界東首次會議於4月14日在旺角教協辦事處舉行，鍾指會議由戴耀廷、區諾軒、他本人及程張迎主持，並有數十人參與，均由戴邀請，包括何桂藍、鄒家成、劉頴匡，以及民主黨、公民黨、人民力量、社民連和區政聯盟的代表。鍾指，一些沒參與選舉協調的組織都有參與，指基本上戴耀廷在 Facebook 觀察到在政治上和在該區「比較活躍」的團體，「都會邀請佢嚟一齊商討。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問會議一開始有沒有人進行介紹，鍾指沒有印象，因他當天遲到，而他到場後戴耀廷正邀請各參與者介紹自己。被問是否認識何桂藍，鍾稱「我喺2019年嘅社會事件上面知佢係『立場姐姐』囉」，至於鄒家成，鍾則知道他參選2019年區議會選舉，但因與民主黨撞區，最後落敗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾指會上討論協調方案-與會者關注約束力問題惟無深入討論如何處理&quot;&gt;鍾指會上討論協調方案 與會者關注約束力問題惟無深入討論如何處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾指與會者自我介紹後，大家就商討新界東究竟採取「初選」抑或「協調」的方案，並指印象中是由戴耀廷介紹。陳慶偉一度問，一份名為「35+計劃」的文件有否向與會者介紹或傳閱？庭上早前展示該文件，提及「五大訴求，缺一不可」及各區議席目標等。鍾稱「冇印象」，指戴耀廷很多時透過 WhatsApp 主動發出該些文件，但他沒印象收到，在會議前亦沒印象戴有發出任何關於會議的資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就上述兩個方案，鍾指有部分人選擇「初選」、部分人選擇「協調」。被問與會者有否解釋選擇的原因，鍾指是「關於約束力嘅問題」，指協調方案是商討好目標議席數目後，全部人都可以參選，但「部分嘅參選人會擔心有人唔承認成個協議，繼續去參選或者繼續進行佢嘅選舉工程」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋問，就約束力的問題，戴耀廷有否要求參與者作出任何協議，鍾稱「會上面冇討論到如何有一個大家有說服力嘅方法去令大家都 binding（被約束）」，並在法官追問下指即「冇傾過」相關方法，指「大家表達完關注（約束力的問題）之後，冇就住呢個問題深入去討論點執行成件事」。至於會上有沒有記錄，鍾稱「我冇獲知會呢個會議係有記錄」，亦沒有獲展示黎敬輝所做的筆記。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾指趙家賢會上無發言會上無印象有人提戴耀廷文章&quot;&gt;鍾指趙家賢會上無發言、會上無印象有人提戴耀廷文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟確認，民主動力的趙家賢和黎敬輝都有出席該會議，「但係佢哋係嚟旁聽」，二人亦沒有提出意見，趙家賢會上亦沒有說過任何話。不過趙家賢早前供稱會上有本土派質疑民主動力是「大台」時，他有作回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鍾本人，則就採用「初選」或「棄選」方案，及目標出選議席數量「帶領大家討論」。法官陳慶偉指，鍾錦麟當時有兩個身分（wore two hats），即西貢區議會主席及民主動力副召集人，但他在新東首次會議只有一個身分？鍾指「正確」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋其後展示戴耀廷於3月31日發布的〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉、3月10日的〈齊上齊落　目標 35+〉，及4月14日的〈攬炒的定義和時間〉，提及要取得立會過半，及預計立法會會期只有7個多月等。羅問，新東首次會議上有沒有人提及過上述3篇文章的概念？鍾指「冇印象有」，亦沒有印象有人對戴的文章發表任何意見。此前趙家賢曾稱新東首次會議上，有本土派稱支持戴〈攬炒的定義和時間〉一文，戴並以「溫和好多」字眼解釋，而鄒家成和莊榮輝等亦就否決預算案字眼「企晒起身」討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅天瑋指會問及下一個議題，案件明天續審。臨散庭前，法官陳仲衡着鍾不可以與其他人提及本案，又指相信已安排處理鍾的證供。此前趙家賢作供第3天仍管有其證人供詞。羅天瑋回覆相信懲教有安排，鍾並主動舉手補充：「我嘅證供已經係被懲教署入起咗，封存咗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two dates from 2022 seem certain to echo in geopolitical history. The first, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, hardly needs further explanation. The second is October 7, when the United States government enacted a series of new export control regulations targeting China’s artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductor industries. While most Americans are likely only faintly aware of the October 7 policy and its significance, the date marked the beginning of a new era in U.S.-China relations and with it international politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken nearly said as much in a speech delivered only ten days after the new policy was enacted. “We are at an inflection point,” Blinken said. “The post-Cold War world has come to an end, and there is an intense competition underway to shape what comes next. And at the heart of that competition is technology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the October 7 policy was narrowly targeted. It only restricted exports of certain types of advanced computer chips for AI applications and the diverse set of technologies needed to design and manufacture AI chips. However, the implementation approach and underlying logic of the new regulations marked a major reversal of 25 years of U.S. trade and technology policy toward China in at least three ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, rather than restricting exports of advanced semiconductor technology to China based on whether the exports were related to military end-uses or to prohibited end-users, the new policy restricted them on a geographic basis for China as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, previous U.S. export controls were designed to allow China to progress technologically, but to restrict the pace so that the United States and its allies retained a durable lead. The new policy, by contrast, actively degraded the peak technological capability of China’s semiconductor industry. Leading Chinese semiconductor firms such as Biren, YMTC, SMIC, and SMEE have all been set back years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, to the extent possible, the policy seeks to prevent China from ever again reaching certain advanced performance thresholds in semiconductor technology. Rather than revising the performance thresholds upward every few years as had been done in the past, the Biden administration intends to hold those benchmarks constant, meaning that the gap in performance will grow over time as the world advances and China remains stuck behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The October 7 policy and the ongoing U.S. campaign to persuade key U.S. allies to join it represents a transformed landscape for the Chinese semiconductor industry, which had previously been making rapid, albeit uneven, technological progress. This report provides clues to understanding China’s updated semiconductor strategy in this new era of global technology competition. In doing so, it draws upon dozens of CSIS interviews with global semiconductor industry executives, U.S. and international government officials, as well as an analysis of noteworthy Chinese government publications, leadership statements, and commentary from Chinese experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 1: The turning point in China’s strategic thinking on semiconductors&lt;/strong&gt; analyzes key Chinese government publications and policies between 2018 and 2022, providing the necessary historical context to understand China’s reaction to the October 7 export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 2: China’s post-October 7 industrial policy challenge&lt;/strong&gt; characterizes China’s current position in the semiconductor value chain to explain why the October 7 U.S. export controls — as well as the related controls announced in March 2023 by the Netherlands and Japan — pose such a significant challenge for China’s industrial policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 3: China’s strategic objectives in responding to October 7&lt;/strong&gt; provides analysis of China’s strategic objectives for the semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 4: China strikes back — new and old tactics for the updated strategy&lt;/strong&gt; analyzes how China’s government and industry are responding to October 7 and shows how they form the basis of an updated Chinese semiconductor strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-1-the-turning-point-in-chinas-strategic-thinking-on-semiconductors&quot;&gt;Section 1: The Turning Point in China’s Strategic Thinking on Semiconductors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the initial months after the October 7 U.S. export controls, China’s response appeared relatively muted. China publicly criticized U.S. actions in a variety of diplomatic fora, filed a suit against the United States in the World Trade Organization, and reportedly considered (but did not publicly announce) proposals for massive additional semiconductor industry subsidies of more than 1 trillion yuan ($143 billion). A January news report from Bloomberg, citing anonymous Chinese sources, stated that the subsidy plan is on pause. Overall, the aggregate Chinese response in the first few months after October 7 appeared far from equivalent to what the United States had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, developing major policy responses takes time, and in the past two months, there are indications of both retaliation against the United States — such as initiating a cybersecurity review of U.S. memory chip producer Micron — and a shift in China’s overall semiconductor strategy. These will be addressed in greater depth in Section 4 of this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, part of the reason that China’s response to the October 7 export controls seems muted is because China’s “response” had already been underway for years. For China’s leadership, the decisive moment in shaping semiconductor strategy was not October 2022, but April 2018, when the United States imposed extremely strict export controls against a major Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE. While the October 7 export controls were in many ways a far more decisive action on the U.S. side, the harrowing experience with ZTE had already led China’s leadership to view the semiconductor industry primarily in national security terms, not economic terms. They came to believe that more extreme U.S. moves in the future were inevitable, including some of what was ultimately included in the October 7 policy (though China was clearly surprised by the timing, breadth, and sophistication of the controls). Thus, much of the shift in China’s semiconductor strategy to blunt future U.S. semiconductor export controls was already underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the intensity of China’s efforts to eliminate U.S. and allied technology from its semiconductor supply chain, one senior U.S. government official told CSIS, “Even before October 7, on a scale of one to ten, China was already an eleven.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, understanding how China adjusted its strategy in response to the April 2018 semiconductor export controls against ZTE provides the vital context through which to view China’s response to the October 7 export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of the ZTE sanctions is complicated. To briefly summarize: ZTE had illegally evaded U.S. sanctions by selling telecom equipment containing U.S. chip technology to Iran. ZTE got caught by U.S. authorities in March 2016, and, after a year of legal wrangling, pled guilty, settled with the U.S. government, and paid a $1.2 billion fine in March 2017. However, in early 2018, the U.S. government caught ZTE failing to abide by the terms of the settlement and making false statements to the U.S. government, which ZTE again admitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In export controls, the most extreme punishments are usually reserved for companies that repeatedly engage in unlawful activity, especially after pleading guilty. In April 2018, the United States dropped the hammer: the U.S. government imposed sanctions and export controls upon ZTE — China’s second-largest telecommunications equipment company at the time. Among other restrictions, the controls prevented ZTE from buying U.S.-designed semiconductors for use in its telecommunications products. Since many U.S. semiconductor products are specified in international telecommunications technical standards, there was no viable alternative to U.S. technology. ZTE’s manufacturing and sales ground to a halt because they could not build their products without U.S. chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a matter of months, ZTE’s financial situation transformed from significant profitability and rapid growth to imminent bankruptcy. ZTE was ultimately given a lifeline by the intervention of then-U.S. President Donald Trump at the personal request of Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did China’s leadership react to the ZTE crisis? Reaching a firm conclusion about the decision-making process of China’s most senior leadership is notoriously difficult because they learned to be vague and secretive. After the 2015 publication of China’s Made in China 2025 policy sparked an international backlash, the industrial policy language in public Chinese government documents and leadership speeches, including on semiconductors, became significantly more secretive. Even though Made in China 2025 is no longer openly discussed in Chinese government leadership speeches, there is ample evidence that it remains a keystone industrial policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the secrecy and evasiveness, there are three pieces of strong and publicly available evidence that U.S. export controls on ZTE directly led to a major shift in Chinese strategic thinking. First, the Chinese government immediately began commissioning research on its strategic technology vulnerabilities. Second, speeches by Chinese leadership indicate that ZTE was viewed as a turning point. Third, China made significant changes to its semiconductor policy in the years following ZTE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-government-research-into-technology-chokepoints&quot;&gt;China’s Government Research into Technology Chokepoints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July of 2018, Science and Technology Daily, an official newspaper of China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, published a series of articles detailing China’s most vulnerable technology “chokepoints.” (Note: the same Chinese phrase “卡脖子” is sometimes alternatively translated as “strangleholds”). Chokepoint technologies are those for which China is critically dependent upon U.S., Japanese, and European suppliers and for which producing Chinese substitutes is extremely difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Murphy of the Center for Security and Emerging Technology published an astute analysis of the series. In it, Murphy points out that the articles are a rare example of public Chinese government publications that provide specifics on a vague but extremely important phrase, “key and core technologies are controlled by others.” The “others” are the United States and its allies. The “key and core technologies” are the 35 identified chokepoints, seven of which directly relate to the semiconductor industry, spanning nearly every segment of the semiconductor value chain. The phrase began to frequently appear in Chinese leadership speeches and state-run media after April 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;speeches-by-chinese-leaders-after-the-april-2018-zte-crisis&quot;&gt;Speeches by Chinese Leaders after the April 2018 ZTE Crisis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second key set of evidence on the importance of April 2018 are Chinese leadership speeches. In November 2018, Dr. Tan Tieniu, then the Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, gave a speech before many of China’s most senior leadership at the 13th National People’s Congress Standing Committee. In the speech, he argued that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The U.S. ban on ZTE fully demonstrates the importance of independent, controllable core-, high-, and foundational technologies. In order to avoid repeating this disaster, China should learn its lesson about importing core electronic components, high-end general-purpose chips, and foundational software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of what Tan argues is consistent with decades of Chinese industrial policy, including Made in China 2025. However, Tan’s speech is indicative of how the ZTE experience in 2018 marked a turning point in the thinking of China’s senior leadership. Strengthening China’s position in strategic technologies was already a long-term economic development policy goal, but it was now also an urgent national security priority: reducing China’s vulnerability to U.S. economic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Tan’s language is blunter, the need to reduce the Chinese technology ecosystem’s exposure to foreign pressure on national security grounds likewise became a recurring theme of General Secretary Xi’s speeches in the wake of the ZTE crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, in a November 2018 Speech, Xi said that “Internationally, advanced technology and key technology is more and more difficult to obtain. Unilateralism and trade protectionism have risen, forcing us to travel the road of self-reliance.” Keeping with China’s goal of industrial policy secrecy, the speech was censored. For their international editions, Chinese government news outlets removed all of Xi’s use of the phrase “self-reliance.” The phrase has an important and controversial connection to Mao Zedong-era China. It also echoes the Made in China 2025 strategy of reducing China’s dependence on foreign technology. The Roadmap of Major Technical Domains for Made in China 2025, which was published in September 2015 and covered semiconductors and other sectors, included goals such as “replacement of imports with Chinese-made products basically achieved in key industries” by 2025. The self-reliance phrase also recalls Chinese efforts to improve technology through intellectual property theft and coercing foreign firms to transfer technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2020, the U.S.-China Trade war had caused Xi and other Chinese officials to return to more hawkish (and candid) language. Xi gave a speech in which he compared the urgency of China’s modern need for improved domestic technology independence to the significance of China’s 20th century nuclear weapons development program, a success that is deeply revered in Communist Party ideology. Xi further stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for industry, some critical, core technologies are under the control of others. We rely on imports for some critical devices . . . We need to rush forward with technologies that can make rapid breakthroughs and promptly solve problems. As for strategic technologies that require a long time to succeed, these need to be deployed ahead of schedule . . . China is faced with many “chokepoint” technological problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the overall Chinese strategy goes further than merely freeing itself from technological dependence on the United States: China also wants to ensure that the United States is dependent upon China. On April 10, 2020, Xi gave a speech at the seventh meeting of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission in which he said, “we must tighten international production chains’ dependence on China, forming powerful countermeasures and deterrent capabilities based on artificially cutting off supply to foreigners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;changes-in-chinas-semiconductor-policy&quot;&gt;Changes in China’s Semiconductor Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third piece of evidence that ZTE marked a turning point in Chinese thinking comes from the actual behavior of Chinese companies and especially the policies of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the private sector, Chinese technology companies began — with extraordinary government financial support — amassing stockpiles of chips and chip-making equipment, buying far in excess of current demand as a hedge against potential future restrictions. Semiconductor executives told CSIS that they had routinely referred to Chinese customers under the label of “non-market demand,” meaning that the customers were buying for strategic reasons unrelated to market conditions or profit-maximization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the public sector, the Chinese government continued with earlier efforts to massively subsidize growth of the Chinese semiconductor sector but changed its emphasis. The $21 billion National Integrated Circuit Industry Fund (commonly referred to as China’s “Big Fund”) that China’s central government launched in 2014 was renewed in 2019 with an additional $35 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all Chinese industrial policy, China’s local governments play a critical role in implementing central government semiconductor policy, including bearing much of the financial burden. In addition to the national-level Big Fund, China’s local governments established 15 semiconductor investment funds worth an additional $25 billion. China also stepped up its basket of other industry support tools, including government grants, tax breaks, equity investments, and low interest loans. The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association estimated in 2021 that these direct and indirect subsidies were worth more than $50 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the ZTE experience, China’s massive state support increased. More importantly, though, the subsidies shifted to prioritize the growth of domestic semiconductor capacity and alternatives to foreign, especially U.S., technology dependencies. Rather than pursuing the most profitable market opportunities, the Chinese government directed state support toward eliminating chokepoint dependencies in China’s semiconductor value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this strategic shift was put in motion shortly after the ZTE experience, but it was formally written down in the Chinese State Council’s July 2020 Document No. 8 “Issuance of the New Era to Promote the Integrated Circuit Industry.” In an analysis of Document No. 8, Tai Ming Cheung, Barry Naughton, and Eric Hagt, wrote that China’s central government “essentially advocated unlimited support for semiconductor projects,” and directs all Chinese local governments to “do everything in their power” to promote the semiconductor sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Document No. 8 provides financial and other support measures like exempting most Chinese semiconductor companies from most import duties and corporate profit taxes, with some sectors exempted from taxes for as long as ten years. The document acknowledges China’s need for foreign semiconductor technology imports, but it firmly grounds this in a self-reliance mindset. It states that, “For a certain period of time, key integrated circuit and software companies receiving state support must temporarily import equipment for their own use.” China views semiconductor equipment imports as a temporary waypoint on the path to technological self-sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the publication of Document No. 8, China published its 14th 5-year economic plan, covering the years 2021-2025. In an August 2020 speech discussing the 5-year economic plan, Xi stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The international economy, technology, culture, security and politics are undergoing fundamental shifts in many ways. The world is entering into a time of turbulence and transformation. For a while, we will face an external environment with more adverse forces. Therefore, we must be prepared for a series of new risks and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We must fully bring into play the obvious advantage of China’s socialist system, namely its ability to focus effort on undertaking daunting tasks and do a good job in the fierce battle for key and core technologies. China has a gigantic market and full-fledged industrial system, which is a unique advantage to foster massive application and rapid iteration of new technologies. With such strength, we are able to accelerate the conversion of S&amp;amp;T achievements into real productive forces, and to improve and protect the security of our production chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Xi’s thinking is reflected in the final, public version of the 5-year plan adopted in October 2020, which declares the semiconductor industry to be a top technology priority. The official summary of the Communist Party’s Central Committee meeting adopting the 5-year plan was blunt: it stated that China would “make technological self-sufficiency a strategic pillar of national development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the ZTE event did not occur in a vacuum, and it was not the sole factor in the Chinese government’s new semiconductor strategy. Other events during the Trump administration also weighed heavily, including U.S. sanctions on Huawei and Fujian Jinhua, the Dutch government blocking exports of Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography machines, and the U.S.-China Trade War. Nevertheless, the three lines of evidence summarized above show that Chinese national security leadership was focused on the problem of dependence on U.S. technology years before October 2022. These leaders, including Xi, knew that even their strongest technology companies could potentially be strangled quickly and decisively by a U.S. government willing to exploit America’s control of technology chokepoints. Thus, when the Biden administration launched the October 7, 2022 export controls policy, many of the key strategic pillars of the Chinese response were already underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as Moscow’s weaponization of Europe’s dependence on Russian natural gas sparked efforts to remake Europe’s energy sector toward a future without Russia, countries that exploit their strategic position in the semiconductor industry risk persuading geopolitical competitors that they must fiercely work to free themselves of such vulnerabilities or develop countermeasures. Countries with a privileged position in the semiconductor value chain therefore would face a tradeoff between the foreign policy benefits of exploiting their advantage now and the potential risks of weakening, over time, the customer dependence that is the source of that advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, that tradeoff was less of a factor in this case. From the perspective of the Biden administration, the U.S. and its allies were already bearing most of the cost of enacting a policy such as the October 7 export controls even before Biden took office. The key here is that in the mid-2010s China was already aggressively pursuing a semiconductor self-sufficiency strategy under the Made in China 2025 economic development policy. Then, in April 2018, the ZTE crisis and related U.S. actions had shifted China’s main semiconductors focus from one of many economic development “nice to have” goals to an urgent national security priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time the Biden administration took office, China’s leaders were already persuaded that America could never be trusted when it comes to semiconductors, and that China should do whatever it takes to build an all-Chinese supply chain as quickly as possible. In making such an assessment, the Biden administration had the benefit of not only all the publicly available evidence reviewed in this report, but also classified intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China was already going to pursue semiconductor technology independence at any cost — regardless of the Biden administration’s actions — that necessitated a changed approach from the United States and its allies. Instead of attempting to persuade China away from its “self-reliance” strategy, the United States now needed to ensure that the strategy failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-2-chinas-post-october-7-industrial-policy-challenge&quot;&gt;Section 2: China’s Post-October 7 Industrial Policy Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global semiconductor value chain is remarkably complex. Some companies play a diverse set of roles, and others are highly specialized. But no single company — indeed no single country — is currently capable of internally performing all roles in the value chain for all the types of semiconductors required for a modern economy. Leading chip sellers routinely have tens of thousands of suppliers distributed globally, and some suppliers are the only companies in the world that possess their technological capabilities at the required performance and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. October 7 export controls, alongside the related export controls adopted by Japan and the Netherlands in March 2023, have been analyzed at length in other CSIS reports. Readers are advised to consult these analyses for a more in-depth treatment of the challenge that these policies pose to China’s AI and semiconductor industries, as well as the legitimate national security reasons that the United States and its allies have for pursuing the policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section will focus instead on the significant challenge that the (now multilateral) October 7 export controls pose to China’s industrial strategy for semiconductors. The three countries — along with Taiwan and Korea which are partly covered by U.S. application of the Foreign Direct Product Rule — are working together in a way that challenges China’s ambitions across nearly every segment of the semiconductor value chain. The export controls target China across design, design software, fabrication, materials, chemicals, and manufacturing equipment. Within equipment, the combination of U.S., Dutch, and Japanese controls covers nearly every type of advanced chip-making equipment: etching, lithography, deposition, metrology, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RNnqEQr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means that China’s dreams of self-reliance will face multiple extremely challenging technological barriers that China must overcome simultaneously in order to extract any benefit or financial return on investment. Even if China succeeds in creating an advanced AI chip-design firm, Chinese foundries cannot fabricate the chips without advanced foreign equipment and chemicals, which are restricted by the export controls. International chip foundries will refuse to fabricate the Chinese designs, because these are covered by the U.S. application of the foreign direct product rule on U.S. chip design software and U.S. manufacturing equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is even more difficult for Chinese chip foundries, which cannot import the advanced production equipment they need to make chips better than the performance thresholds covered in the export controls (16nm logic, 18nm DRAM, and 128-layer NAND). Even if a Chinese semiconductor equipment firm succeeds in making a single type of advanced equipment domestically — an astonishingly difficult and expensive task — that piece of equipment is nearly useless by itself. In the same way that no commercial jet airliner can fly without wings, engines, electronics, and landing gear, only a complete set of semiconductor production equipment can produce a finished chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the degree of precision and reliability required for advanced semiconductor manufacturing means that there is a major gap between building a prototype system and producing such systems at competitive performance and scale. Thus, individual Chinese company successes in a single advanced technology cannot gain commercial market traction. The entire Chinese semiconductor ecosystem has to be domestically self-sufficient before China can produce chips at the October 7 performance thresholds. This is the October 7 challenge that China’s semiconductor industrial policy confronts. Of course, it also faces the traditional challenges of industrial policy: information asymmetry and crony capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information asymmetry refers to the fact that government bureaucrats generally do not know which firms will effectively use government subsidies and protectionist policies (which firms want) to advance the country’s overall technology level (which the government wants).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crony capitalism refers to the fact that many approaches to allocating subsidies (aka “picking winners”) will merely result in political capture through an alliance of rent-seeking firms and corrupt government officials. Politically connected firms often secure government support for reasons unrelated to their technological and managerial competence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional industrial policy mechanism for solving these two challenges is “export discipline,” which conditions state support such that it primarily rewards firms for successfully exporting in foreign markets rather than selling to protected domestic ones. Foreign customers in technologically advanced economies will naturally demand that their exporting suppliers adopt international best practices in management and technology to meet their stringent standards. Foreign customers can also provide expertise and other support to directly aid a supplier’s advancement. This solves both the information asymmetry problem (since bureaucrats can align subsidies to a clear exports metric that provides the needed market signal) and the crony capitalism problem (by automatically allocating subsidies according to export success rather than political connections).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export discipline played a significant role in the successful industrial policies and technological development of Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea during the 20th century. China’s modern export boom, however, occurred after China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), which banned export subsidies for its members in 1995. China has at different times provided various government incentives — such as tax rebates, an under-valued currency, and low-interest loans — to encourage exports, but the Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese approaches were more targeted and linked to specific performance criteria, fostering a stronger sense of export discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, China’s post-WTO industrial policy approach (especially after 2006) to ensuring that subsidies and protectionist support are productively allocated toward desired economic and technological development goals took a different path, one that relies more on foreign firms owning production facilities in China. China was far more reliant upon foreign direct investment than South Korea, Japan, or Taiwan during their major growth periods. The influx of foreign capital, technology, and managerial expertise has been instrumental in the growth of many industries in China, including semiconductors. By contrast, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan relied more on domestic investment (through strict government control of the financial system) and technology transfers through licensing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for China, the Chinese domestic market is now large enough that some of the traditional weak points of industrial policy are less of a factor than they were in those countries. Even in Chinese industries that are almost entirely protected from foreign competition, such as internet tech, the competition in the domestic market is fierce enough to weed out weak players, and the market is large enough to support multiple large-scale firms. Semiconductor producers in South Korea and Taiwan, by contrast, had no choice but to rely on exports in order to generate sufficient revenues to support the relevant economies of scale and the organizational learning scale provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the necessary background to understand why the October 7 export controls pose such a challenge for the advancement of the Chinese semiconductor industry. For Chinese chipmakers and chip equipment makers, as well as the bureaucrats seeking to support them, exposure to international markets was the key to providing the critical feedback needed to ensure that they pursued the right technological and operational development path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before October 7, China’s chip manufacturing industry could walk that path one step at a time, making progress in advanced etching equipment while lagging in lithography, for example. Now, however, for China to produce chips at the 16 nm logic node or better (or the equivalent technology benchmarks in memory), China will have to break through every single incredibly difficult technological barrier before its firms can begin producing advanced chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse, Chinese semiconductor equipment firms will have to do so almost entirely without expertise and advice provided by U.S., Japanese, and Dutch firms. The export controls make transfers of such knowledge also subject to export license requirements, and thus de facto banned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are essentially no prospects for foreign customers of Chinese chipmaking equipment. Most of the advanced Chinese equipment producers have been added to the U.S. entity list, meaning they are too risky to have as a supplier for products where a long-term relationship is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospects are better for foreign customers of Chinese chipmakers (aka “fabs”). Since many international companies assemble their finished goods in China, many “domestic” chip sales actually represent global market and international customer demand. Even here, however, the situation has worsened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-2022, Apple was on track to purchase advanced NAND memory chips from China’s YMTC for use in iPhones. Apple cancelled the order in the wake of the export controls. Qualcomm, which alone accounts for about 20% of Chinese foundry SMIC’s revenue, is reportedly considering whether to drop SMIC as a supplier even for chips less advanced than those covered by the October 7 performance thresholds. Computer maker Dell announced plans to cease purchases of Chinese chips by 2024. As China’s semiconductor industry becomes increasingly government-driven and cracks down on foreign firms, this global exodus will accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China’s advanced node (though not legacy node) chipmaking industry, export discipline (or the version with Chinese characteristics) is now essentially off the table. That means China will have to achieve economies of scale and the organizational learning that scale brings with almost entirely domestic sales. That is not inconceivable, but it is far riskier and more expensive. China’s domestic semiconductor market is massive. But, as mentioned above, much of that “domestic” demand is international in nature, since semiconductors are an intermediate good for finished products assembled in China for foreign-owned firms and export to global markets. These domestic Chinese chip sales to foreign firms are likely to drop off. Without export discipline, China lacks a clear path to avoid the traps of information asymmetry and crony capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, China’s government has a poor track record of picking winners in the semiconductor industry. In recent years, the strategy has essentially been to flood the sector with money, watch new entrants rush in, and then double down on the winners. In low capex segments of the semiconductor industry, such as chip design, this is a viable strategy, especially when paired with export discipline. But in the high capex segments of the industry, such as chip fabrication and semiconductor equipment manufacturing, the costs of doing anything other than picking a small set of winners in advance are astronomical. Thus, China has had to place a few extremely expensive bets and watch most of the “winners” that the Chinese government picks go bankrupt even with massive government support. 3,470 Chinese chip companies shuttered in the first 8 months of 2022 (i.e., even before October 7), up from 1,397 in the full year 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widespread corruption does not help. Many of these bankrupt chip companies died under a cloud of corruption, financial fraud, and extraordinary waste. Several of the top leaders of China’s semiconductor “Big Fund” were arrested in 2022 on corruption charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high capex requirements of these segments already made executing China’s standard playbook especially difficult. A near total loss of the ability to rely on export discipline — certainly in advanced segments — is going to make China’s crony capitalism and corruption challenges worse. In the non-advanced segments, Chinese chip equipment producers are still subject to foreign competition, whose products are vastly superior on every metric that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is probably willing to pump vastly more money into the system, but at this scale the marginal value of additional money is relatively low and probably more likely to enrich corrupt officials than it is to produce leading firms. A U.S. government official told CSIS that “Chinese semiconductor subsidies were already past the limit of what the industry could productively absorb.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these extraordinary headwinds, China is not going to give up. Perhaps 20th century Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan had the better industrial policy, but 21st century China is richer and more stubborn. In many other sectors, such as electric cars, China’s leadership has shown extraordinary patience and a willingness to waste astonishing sums of money in order to give birth to globally competitive Chinese firms. Sometimes, however, this patience has borne fruit: a recent Economist article was titled “China’s BYD is overtaking Tesla as the carmaker extraordinaire.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, China’s basic strategy of pursuing self-reliance in semiconductors on national security grounds was already solidified after April 2018 and remains in place. However, October 7 was a watershed moment in international relations, one that occurred sooner than China expected and poses major challenges to China’s industrial policy for semiconductors. There is no doubt that China will respond with an updated strategy and new tactics. Some elements of this are already underway. This response is the focus of Section 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-3-chinas-strategic-objectives-in-responding-to-october-7&quot;&gt;Section 3: China’s Strategic Objectives in Responding to October 7&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of October 7, China is pursuing four strategic objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limiting China’s exposure to foreign economic pressure&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deterring future U.S. and allied economic pressure&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing international economic dependence upon China&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gaining the economic and security benefits of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limiting-chinas-exposure-to-foreign-pressure&quot;&gt;Limiting China’s Exposure to Foreign Pressure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the relevant economic pressure topic is covered in Section 1, but there is an additional issue worth raising: the risk of an all-out semiconductor embargo by the United States and potentially U.S. allies as well. China imported more than $350 billion worth of semiconductors in 2020, more in dollar terms than China’s imports of oil. Loss of access to all foreign chips and chip technology would be economically apocalyptic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, multilateral chip export controls would have been apocalyptic for Russia had China not helped to fill the gap for its “no limits” Russian partner. An all-out chip embargo on China is likely in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and perhaps plausible in some other scenarios, such as a blockade of Taiwan. Given that Xi has reportedly given the Chinese military the goal of being able to invade Taiwan by 2027, this is no doubt a factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterring-future-us-and-allied-economic-pressure&quot;&gt;Deterring Future U.S. and Allied Economic Pressure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the October 7 export controls, a great deal of commentary focused on how China might retaliate. As will be discussed more in Section 4, China is retaliating, and China will continue to retaliate. However, some of this focus on retaliation confuses ends and means. China’s central strategic aim when it comes to AI and semiconductors is not to punish the United States: it is to gain and preserve the strategic benefits of the technologies. The point of retaliation is to deter future action by the United States and its allies, not to score points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The October 7 export controls were a significantly more damaging set of semiconductor sanctions and export controls than those pursued by the Trump Administration. U.S. economic pressure has increased significantly over the past five years (in response to escalating Chinese provocations) and at this point are damaging what China perceives to be its core strategic interests. China had two options if it wants to change U.S. behavior, to either deter or appease. As will be discussed more in Section 4, China has chosen to deter and is undertaking a retaliatory campaign that is more willing to inflict pain upon the United States — even at the cost of pain to China — than during prior disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increasing-foreign-dependence-upon-china&quot;&gt;Increasing Foreign Dependence upon China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest current source of global dependence upon China in the semiconductor industry is as a customer. This is the natural flip side of the $350 billion in Chinese imports mentioned above. When the flow of chips stops, so does the flow of money, and semiconductor companies need a lot of money. According to 2019 data from the Semiconductor Industry Association, Chinese customers comprised&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;26 percent of chip demand by corporate headquarters of the electronic device maker (e.g., phone, computer, washing machine);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;35 percent of chip demand by location of electronic device assembly (including foreign-owned firms that perform assembly in China); and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;24 percent of chip demand by location of electronic device end-users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, China was also the world’s largest customer market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, representing 26 percent of global demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China’s share of both chip demand and equipment demand has shrunk significantly due to both China’s Covid-19 lockdown restrictions and the October 7 controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has proven willing to cut off access to its customers as a tool of foreign policy, in markets as widely divergent as fishing, wine, and NBA basketball TV broadcasts. Chinese leaders talk openly about their willingness to use conditional market access as a tool of foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand-side coercive power only goes so far, though, and China seeks strengthened supply-side coercive power as well. Xi said in April 2020, “we must tighten international production chains’ dependence on China, forming powerful countermeasures and deterrent capabilities based on artificially cutting off supply to foreigners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has become an important supplier of chips in the world, responsible for 9 percent of global production in 2020, but the Chinese share of global chip production declined significantly during the Covid-19 lockdown years. China’s chip production capacity is concentrated in legacy nodes, defined as 28-nanometer or larger. Legacy chips remain vital for a large set of industries, demand is expected to increase, and China is by far the largest investor in this area. If China succeeds in establishing a dominant position in legacy chips, this could give China genuine coercive power in key market segments such as automotive chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s most frequently discussed source of near-term coercive power is its dominance of rare-earth metal mining and especially refining capacity, controlling more than 60 percent and 80 percent respectively of global capacity. There’s an important difference, however, between China’s dominance of rare earths and the U.S. dominance of semiconductors. China is vulnerable in semiconductors because it lacks technology and a credible path to acquire it. The United States and its allies are vulnerable in rare earth metals only because they have not shown adequate political will to address the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ position in rare earths is analogous to the crisis of Europe’s dependence of Russian natural gas. Europe had all the technology to build additional liquid natural gas shipping terminals and the wealth to acquire foreign sources. It simply had a different strategy of “peace through trade” that ensured no substantive attempt to build out the capacity. However, once Russia invaded Ukraine, the crisis created the necessary political will. Any Chinese move to cut off rare earth metals would spark a rush to develop new mines and new refining capacity — as occurred when China restricted rare earth exports to Japan in 2010. Developing alternative sources is far from instantaneous, but slow normal timelines in mine permitting and refining installation construction and can be vastly accelerated during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is not true of China’s pursuit of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. China has been pursuing an intense development effort for more than a decade. After April 2018, that effort morphed into a genuine national security priority with nearly unlimited resources available. Even so, China has relatively little to show for its efforts other than waste and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gaining-the-economic-and-security-benefits-of-ai&quot;&gt;Gaining the Economic and Security Benefits of AI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to AI, senior leaders in China, including Xi himself, believe that leadership in AI is foundational to the future of military, economic, and geopolitical power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, modern AI has already demonstrated remarkable national security capabilities spanning military, intelligence, surveillance, and propaganda, most recently in the war in Ukraine. For nearly a decade, senior U.S. national security leaders have openly stated that they believe that AI will be the key technology to enable continued U.S. military superiority over China. The recent generative AI revolution makes it clear that continued rapid progress in AI technology is unlikely to slow anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained in a previous CSIS report, the purpose of the October 7 export controls was to exploit U.S. control of strategic semiconductor technologies in order to choke off China’s access to future progress in AI, including its national security applications. In fact, many of the policy ideas implemented by the October 7 export controls were recommended 18 months earlier in the final report of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the Biden administration views export controls on semiconductors as the means to an end. The end is ensuring that the security of the United States and its allies is not threatened by Chinese advances in AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the challenge that China’s leaders are responding to. Retaliation is one tool in that policy response, but it is not the most important one. Section 4 will address the major initiatives that China is undertaking in pursuit of its strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-4-china-strikes-back--new-and-old-tactics-for-the-updated-strategy&quot;&gt;Section 4: China Strikes Back — New and Old Tactics for the Updated Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the overall strategy and its goals are broadly similar, China has adopted a combination of new tactics and redoubled efforts on old ones. Though there is more to China’s efforts worthy of consideration, this section will focus on the following five major tactics that China is employing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evading the new controls and continuing to access foreign technology;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seeking to divide the United States from its allies;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acquiring foreign technology through industrial espionage and talent recruitment;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pressuring Chinese firms to buy Chinese and eliminate American suppliers; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Retaliating against the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evading-new-controls-and-continuing-to-access-foreign-technology&quot;&gt;Evading New Controls and Continuing to Access Foreign Technology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the four major categories of exports covered by the October 7 controls, the restrictions on chip-making equipment are by far the easiest to enforce. The equipment is large, extremely expensive, and requires a massive amount of post-sales support. These are all features that make export controls easier to enforce. By contrast, AI chips are small, lightweight, and may require no post sales support whatsoever. That makes them an ideal target for smuggling. While no confirmed cases of post-October 7 AI chip smuggling have been reported, chip smuggling has long been a familiar practice in China. In December 2022, a woman was arrested by Chinese customs officials for attempting to smuggle 202 chips inside a false pregnancy belly, though she was trying to avoid Chinese import duties, not evade U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. government official told CSIS that China is “definitely” attempting to evade the controls or even outright smuggle the chips. This is easy in small quantities but considerably tougher to accomplish at the needed scale for training large AI models. A small set of hyperscale cloud operators and datacenter providers constitute the vast majority of global demand for the most advanced AI chips. That makes corporate export compliance through “know your customer” and other efforts much easier. Attempting to achieve the necessary scale by aggregating many small purchases through shell companies is possible but would be a slow and laborious process. The U.S. government has also stepped up intelligence community support for export controls enforcement, which should aid the likelihood of catching smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in recent weeks, China has begun a crackdown on the foreign consulting firms that support corporate due diligence efforts, including those related to identifying shell companies and other measures to complying with U.S. export controls and sanctions. As the U.S. government and U.S. firms are trying to gather more information that will allow them to precisely target de-risking efforts, China is taking a classically authoritarian approach that is making that more difficult. There is almost certainly more to come in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more pressing Chinese tactic for avoiding the controls is accessing computing capacity through the cloud. Since the regulations target geographic destination and not corporate ownership, it remains entirely legal for Chinese AI companies to import the chips to their subsidiaries in, say, India and then allow Chinese programmers in China to access the computing capacity via the cloud. As predicted in a previous CSIS report, this is indeed occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Chinese AI companies can simply absorb the performance hit of using chips that comply with the export control performance thresholds, which require chips to meet a dual threshold across processing power and interconnect speed. Nvidia, a leading provider of chips for training AI models, has released reduced interconnect variants of its best AI chips that can legally be exported to China. Lennart Heim of the Centre for the Governance of AI has estimated that the overall performance penalty for using one of these chips compared with the international market model is less than 10 percent. That is certainly tolerable for well-resourced Chinese AI companies and national security organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;seeking-to-divide-the-united-states-from-its-allies&quot;&gt;Seeking to Divide the United States from Its Allies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four countries — the United States, Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea — are responsible for the vast majority of global semiconductor equipment sales. Unsurprisingly, as soon as the United States announced the October 7 controls, Chinese firms began courting equipment makers in the other countries. China’s government also began pressuring the other countries to not go along with the U.S. controls. In the case of the Netherlands and Japan, that pressure continues even now. Only days after Japan submitted draft export control regulations for public comment, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang told his Japanese counterpart, Yoshimasa Hayashi, that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The US once brutally contained Japan’s semi-conductor industry by resorting to bullying practices. Today the US has repeated its tricks on China. As the saying goes, do not do unto others what you don’t want done unto you. As the keenly-felt pain still stings, Japan should not help a villain do evil. The blockade will only further stimulate China’s determination for independence and self-development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in a March 20 interview with a Dutch newspaper, Tan Jian, China’s ambassador to the Netherlands said, “This will not be without consequences. I’m not going to speculate on countermeasures, but China won’t just swallow this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Netherlands and Japan have already made plans to join the United States in placing export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, the real audience for these threats is likely South Korea, Germany, and the European Union, which have yet to join the multilateral export control regime and may weigh the severity of China’s actions toward Japan and the Netherlands in their choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea is the most important country to add to the equipment export controls. South Korea is a small but sophisticated player in the global semiconductor manufacturing market, with roughly 5 percent global market share. Though South Korean equipment firms are generally less advanced than those of the other three countries, South Korean equipment companies are significantly more advanced than those of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea also has deep linkages to the Chinese semiconductor industry. South Korea’s two largest memory producers, Samsung and SK Hynix both have a significant share of their global memory production located in China, and both operate facilities worth tens of billions of dollars that make chips sophisticated enough to be subject to U.S. export controls. Ironically, these firms are also subject to Chinese export controls, which prohibit the South Korean firms from moving the tens of billions of dollars’ worth of equipment (none of which was built by China) out of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, South Korea has reasons to be grateful for the October 7 export control policy. The controls were a massive setback to key Chinese competitors: memory chipmakers YMTC (NAND) and CXMT (DRAM). In the days after the October 7 export controls, the stocks of both Samsung and SK Hynix increased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, planned Samsung and SK Hynix production capacity expansion that would have been built in China is now planned for construction on Korean soil. Next year, South Korea is forecast to overtake China as the world’s largest buyer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. This will presumably delight the South Korean government, which has fretted about its growing trade deficit with China. Semiconductors alone comprise nearly 20 percent of South Korea’s total exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production shift back to South Korea is probably also in the best interest of Samsung and SK Hynix. Industry officials told CSIS that Chinese talent poaching from Samsung’s and SK Hynix’s Chinese production facilities played a major role in the rapid technological ascent of both YMTC and CXMT. If operating leading-edge facilities in China requires training the workforce of your future Chinese competitors, Samsung and SK Hynix will certainly view that as a less attractive option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both China and the United States are actively seeking to sway South Korea’s government to their side in the export controls dispute. However, the United States likely has the edge. In addition to the above-mentioned benefits, South Korea’s government has recently pursued closer ties with both the United States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;acquiring-foreign-technology-through-industrial-espionage-and-talent-recruitment&quot;&gt;Acquiring Foreign Technology through Industrial Espionage and Talent Recruitment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial espionage has been a part of the semiconductor industry nearly since its inception. In a declassified Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report from 1977, the CIA wrote that the Soviet Union’s attempt to steal and copy semiconductor manufacturing equipment technology “dwarfs all of their other known illegal purchase efforts.” Of course, the CIA viewed it as a critical U.S. priority to ensure that Soviet acquisition efforts failed, writing that “if the USSR acquires all the equipment that has been ordered, plus manufacturing know-how and training . . . this capability would elevate the USSR to the status of a major world producer of ICs, trailing only Japan and the United States.” Fortunately for the CIA and the United States, the Soviet Union did fail to acquire a complete set of advanced equipment and the knowhow needed to effectively operate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, some industry players have expressed skepticism that industrial espionage is an effective tool, given the importance of tacit knowledge among skilled organizations and workers. Roger Dassen, the Chief Financial Officer of the Dutch lithography equipment firm ASML, said recently that “A lot of ASML’s technology is not on blueprints. It’s in the heads of people. And you don’t need just the blueprints; you need everything surrounding it and the entire supply chain . . . You’re talking about a decade or more before you could replicate something like this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not Dassen is correct, China is clearly trying to steal ASML’s blueprints and much more. ASML’s CEO said in March of this year that ASML has faced thousands of security incidents each year, forcing the company to increase spending on cybersecurity and other protections by a “significant double digit” percentage for multiple years in a row. In a 2018 trial against a former ASML employee who left the company after successfully stealing source code and providing it to Chinese competitors, ASML’s lead attorney said that the theft represented “a plot to get technology for the Chinese government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view was echoed by the Dutch national intelligence agency, which in its 2023 annual report called China “the biggest threat to the Netherlands’ economic security.” In a 2023 interview with the Associated Press, the head of the agency said, “We see that every day they try to steal [technology] from the Netherlands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASML is far from the only semiconductor firm that has been subject to repeated and brazen Chinese attempts to steal technology, whether via cyber espionage or by recruiting employees to steal from their employers. In the U.S. memory chip-maker Micron has been the victim of massive theft and knowledge transfer to Chinese competitor Fujian Jinhua. Contrary to those who claim that espionage is not an effective tool in the semiconductor industry, Fujian Jinhua was able to quickly introduce a DRAM product line that used Micron’s “1x-nm” technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest challenge is for the semiconductor industry of Taiwan. Officials in Taiwan told CSIS that Chinese design firms are often willing to pay Taiwanese engineers 500 percent more than they can make in Taiwan. One official caveated, however, that “this is not a job for life. China will suck the knowledge out of your brain and then fire you, and no Taiwanese firm will hire you back after working for China.” To get around the stigma, Chinese firms have taken to setting up shell companies in Taiwan and recruiting workers to transfer knowledge to China, without ever requiring them to leave Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this challenge, Taiwan has introduced new laws designed to strengthen the security of its industry. This even includes setting up a dedicated economic espionage judicial system to speed up trials and convictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structuring activities to maximize foreign knowledge transfer goes beyond espionage and talent poaching. In interviews, multiple individuals with experience in the semiconductor equipment industry stated that Chinese fabs would often structure their manufacturing operations to run foreign equipment and Chinese-built equipment side by side, operated by the same pool of workers. The Chinese fab workers would then provide feedback to the Chinese equipment companies, advising them how to improve their designs based on their experience with foreign systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pressuring-chinese-firms-to-buy-chinese-and-eliminate-american-suppliers&quot;&gt;Pressuring Chinese Firms to Buy Chinese and Eliminate American Suppliers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering the challenge of advancing China’s level of semiconductor equipment technology, the two biggest advantages that Chinese firms have is that (1) they do not have to do de novo innovation and (2) that they enjoy a lot of state financial support. Regarding the former, Chinese firms do not have to explore the full range of possible technological paths because the correct solution (or at least a correct solution) path has already been discovered by foreign firms. They can focus R&amp;amp;D resources on a single direction that they know can work. Regarding the latter, Chinese equipment can be competitive on price even when it is not competitive on performance and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest disadvantage that Chinese firms have is that their competitors’ equipment already works and has terrific performance, which makes even Chinese fab firms hesitate when picking Chinese equipment providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In slowing the advance of China’s equipment industry, the October 7 export controls were designed to achieve the best of both worlds. In the advanced node segments, Chinese players struggle to get a foothold because they cannot achieve economies of scale until they have a full stack of production equipment technology. In the legacy node segments where Chinese equipment providers have viable product offerings, they will still encounter competition from foreign equipment providers. Legacy equipment products — even those of U.S. firms — are not covered by export controls. International providers offer equipment with performance significantly better than that of Chinese providers. Thus, it is difficult for Chinese equipment providers to achieve relevant economies of scale even in legacy segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Chinese equipment providers cannot learn how to make good products until they have a lot of operational market experience, and they cannot gain significant operational experience because few are interested in buying their unattractive products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leaders have a preferred solution to break this vicious cycle: pressure Chinese fabs to buy Chinese equipment. As Xi said in a speech:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We must firmly grasp this strategic basis that is demand expansion, make each link — production, distribution, circulation and consumption — rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, specify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the achievement of dynamic balance between aggregate supply and demand at higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History gives good cause for skepticism of the Chinese government’s goals. The Made in China 2025 roadmap anticipated that by 2023, Chinese equipment providers would have already mastered large scale production of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) equipment. In reality, China’s leading lithography company, the Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment group (SMEE) is only producing prototype machines equivalent to what ASML was producing at scale a decade and a half ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “all-Chinese” supply chain is also the goal of some influential Chinese firms, including Huawei. In March 2023, Huawei’s chairman said, “For Huawei, we will render our support to all such self-saving, self-strengthening and self-reliance efforts of the Chinese semiconductor industry.” Huawei recently announced that it had collaborated with other Chinese firms to create new chip design software for chips at the 14nm node or above. If the tools are successfully verified, which Huawei stated would happen this year, it would provide a Chinese competitor to the U.S. dominant firms in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the equipment space, Chinese equipment firms will likely supply a majority of the new equipment for fabs producing at the 90nm node or above, according to CSIS discussions with industry executives. However, the executives were skeptical that Chinese equipment firms could supply even 5 percent of the market at the 28nm node within 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese government pressure to “buy Chinese” appears to be extending beyond equipment to the chips themselves. At a recent visit to Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, General Secretary Xi Jinping asked the corporate delegation, “Are the chips in your crane all made locally?” The Chinese government has also launched a campaign to pressure Chinese automakers to dramatically increase their purchases of Chinese-made chips. Currently, only 5 percent of the chips in Chinese cars are made in China, despite many automotive chips being made at legacy nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s leaders recognize that it cannot build an all-Chinese semiconductor supply chain overnight, but they are seeking to bolster domestic demand and supply simultaneously by focusing on legacy chips and chipmaking equipment, which does appear to mark a new tactic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one U.S. semiconductor executive told CSIS in an interview that the Chinese government’s actions matter less than those of the United States: “The Chinese government doesn’t even need to have a ‘no American chips’ policy,” the executive said. “The U.S. government’s actions are plenty frightening to persuade Chinese firms that they should avoid buying American unless they absolutely have to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined, this suggests that China is exploring the approach advocated by Lu Feng, a professor at the Peking University School of Government. In a 2023 interview, Lu argued that China should pursue a strategy of “fully independent manufacturing” in two steps. The first step is “de-Americanization of the production lines,” buying Chinese wherever possible, then from U.S. allies, and only from the United States if necessary. The second step is “replace all foreign equipment and materials with domestically made equipment and materials.” Lu argues that the key to this strategy is not to pursue individual technologies — a major focus of prior Chinese industrial policies — but instead to establish linkages between Chinese players in all segments of the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;retaliating-against-the-united-states-and-its-allies&quot;&gt;Retaliating against the United States and Its Allies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, China is retaliating. Thus far, this retaliation is taking place in two areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, China is using its anti-trust enforcement regime as a block on essentially all mergers and acquisitions involving U.S. semiconductor industry firms. China has employed anti-trust measures to prevent U.S. mergers before, but a December 2022 analysis by the law firm Skadden finds that “Of the thousands of deals that China has reviewed, only three (less than 0.01%) have been prohibited . . . nearly all of the prohibitions, conditional approvals, and abandonments over the past 10 years have occurred in the technology sectors that are important to China’s national growth, such as semiconductors.” Five months later, the Wall Street Journal reported that essentially all semiconductor mergers involving U.S. companies were being significantly slowed or blocked outright. For semiconductor anti-trust reviews, China has taken things from bad to worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China has initiated a cybersecurity review of Micron, the largest U.S. memory chipmaker. In an analysis of the Micron case, Graham Webster, chief of the DigiChina Project at the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center, writes that “the prevalence of Chinese commentary identifying Micron as a company particularly unfriendly to China is important in understanding the context for its cybersecurity review.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Micron fails its cybersecurity review, it could be forced out of the Chinese memory market entirely, a potential loss of $3.3 billion in annual sales. At this point, that outcome seems likely. In addition to being fully consistent with a “de-Americanization” approach, excluding Micron could further benefit the company’s South Korean competitors, Samsung and SK Hynix. It may be that China is using this as a potential diplomatic carrot for South Korea to not join the U.S. export controls regime, in addition to the threatened use of sticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the anti-trust blocking and the Micron review — especially if Micron is ultimately excluded from the Chinese market — are genuinely more significant retaliatory responses than China has taken in the past during, for example, the ZTE dispute. China clearly feels a need to send a more significant signal to deter further U.S. or allied action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is possible that China will ultimately widen the retaliatory measures to additional areas, such as exports of rare earth metals. Thus far, however, China appears to have calculated that such measures would do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 7 was a watershed moment in the history of U.S.-China relations, and the international community is still reorganizing itself in the wake of a new U.S. and allied approach of “de-risking” exposure to China. China is adapting to this changed environment, but perhaps with fewer changes than some expected. This serves as evidence that the Biden administration’s calculations in launching the new policy were generally correct, at least as they concerned the semiconductor industry: U.S. allies got on board, and China had few good options to respond beyond their already extremely aggressive policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weakest link in the new policy, however, is in achieving its primary stated purpose: blunting China’s military adoption of AI technology. That will require strengthened multilateral export control enforcement capacity to prevent chip smuggling, as well as a means of dealing with China’s ability to access needed AI computing resources through the cloud and by purchasing adequately advanced AI chips that comply with the October 7 performance thresholds. Generally, however, this is unsurprising. Technology markets change rapidly, and the only export control regime that has a chance of being effective is one that keeps up with the pace of change.&lt;/p&gt;

A few days later, Russian forces attacked the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) – the first instance of an operational nuclear power plant (NPP) directly targeted as part of a military operation.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Over the past year, Russia’s military activity in Ukraine has resulted in serious threats to the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear infrastructure, and there is good reason to believe that Russia has violated the protections granted to NPPs in international humanitarian law (IHL). Given the significant projected global increase in the number of nuclear reactors over the coming decades, it is likely that this will not be the last time NPPs are in the midst of military conflict. This report seeks to assess the risks the ongoing war poses to NPPs in Ukraine and to draw preliminary conclusions from these events to improve the safety and security of NPPs in conflict.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest threat to Ukraine’s NPPs is unlikely to be from a direct strike on a reactor and an ensuing large-scale radiological incident similar to the 1986 Chornobyl disaster, but rather the failure of key systems – namely, water and energy supply – or human error, potentially resulting in an incident not unlike what occurred at Fukushima Daiichi NPP in 2011. The threat of direct strike is more of a concern when it comes to the pool-type spent nuclear fuel storage or the sarcophagus containing the remnants of the destroyed Unit 4 at the ChNPP, which are not designed to be as robust as the containment structures over the operating reactors. There is also a risk that Ukraine may run out of available storage for its used nuclear fuel as it cannot currently transport spent fuel safely. Finally, the possibility that Russia may manufacture a radiological incident at the ZNPP or another facility to spoil a Ukrainian offensive should not be disregarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report makes three sets of recommendations. The first relates to mitigating the immediate risks posed to nuclear infrastructure in Ukraine. The second relates to strengthening regulations, standards and other considerations to mitigate against potential threats to nuclear safety and security in conflict. The third relates to the conduct of military operations around NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve nuclear safety and security in Ukraine, the international community should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure the personal safety and welfare of staff at NPPs, including sufficient staffing levels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure sufficient licensed Ukrainian staff are ready to resume operations at the ZNPP following Russian withdrawal from the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facilitate the safe transport of spent nuclear fuel to dry-storage facilities, where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assess availability of highly radioactive waste storage facilities and certify additional storage if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear, emergency response and other necessary equipment, training and support to the Ukrainian military, emergency services and NPP operators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide regular updates on the supply of fuel for emergency generators at Ukrainian nuclear facilities, as well as the water levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure the safe supply of diesel fuel, maintenance parts and services, and other materials necessary for the safe operation of Ukraine’s NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Penalise Rosatom staff operating at the ZNPP for participating in Russia’s occupation of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish deterrence against a deliberately manufactured radiological incident by making clear to Russia that any such incident would be followed by a massive response to mitigate damage and expanded support for Ukraine’s war effort.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate against potential threats to nuclear safety and security in future conflict, the international community should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider, and adopt the necessary prevention and mitigation measures for, state-level military conflict and occupation of nuclear facilities by an invading force as part of national threat assessments, design-basis threats and wider national defence and security planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include considerations on military attack and occupation of nuclear facilities in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s nuclear safety and security standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harden physical protections in the design of new NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harden existing NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure the safety and security of NPPs in areas of active operations, the international community should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish a 1-km demilitarised zone around NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grant special protected status to critical NPP safety, security and emergency response systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Define an obligation for the establishment of deconfliction lines by militaries operating around NPPs, as well as the nuclear regulators or other responsible authorities in the concerned states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish regulations relating to effects of cyber and electromagnetic activities applied in the vicinity of NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 led to widespread fears over the safety and security of nuclear power plants (NPPs) after Russian forces occupied two of Ukraine’s five NPPs, struck a nuclear research reactor in Kharkiv and severed power to a research reactor in Kyiv. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the first time that operational NPPs have been the direct objectives of military operations. There are strong reasons to believe that similar challenges are likely to feature in future conflicts. The number of NPPs is expanding globally, and this may accelerate as countries seek to generate power while reducing their carbon emissions. As NPPs become a more prevalent source of energy production, and as energy itself becomes ever-more critical to the wider functioning of societies, warring states will likely seek to exert control over them. It is therefore important to consider how the international community should maximise the safety of NPPs in a conflict context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report aims to consolidate three interrelated discussions. First, it seeks to provide an overview of the safety risks extant in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, what the Ukrainian state has learned from its experiences and what measures may improve the safety of its NPPs during the ongoing conflict. Second, the report seeks to summarise civilian and military actors’ existing obligations and approaches towards NPPs and identify conflicting imperatives that could expose NPPs to risk in future conflicts. Third, the report makes recommendations as to how states can improve the safety and security of their NPPs and how militaries should think about operating around these objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-definitions&quot;&gt;Methodology and Definitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology for this report involves four strands. First, the authors interviewed staff from Ukraine’s NPPs, officials involved in Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and governance, security officials responsible for assessing threats to Ukraine’s NPPs, National Guard personnel responsible for the physical protection of the NPPs, and military personnel conducting operations in the vicinity of Ukraine’s NPPs. The authors carried out many of these interviews in Ukraine in March 2023. Second, the report draws on physical inspection of Ukrainian nuclear facilities and observation of operations conducted in their vicinity in the summer of 2022. Third, the report draws on a review of publicly available information and assessments of the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear infrastructure – before and since February 2022 – produced by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Ukrainian authorities and other experts. Fourth, the report draws on a comparative survey of military doctrine and the historical record of military operations affecting NPPs both directly and indirectly. Academic literature and expert commentary and analysis on nuclear safety and security in conflict, including in the ongoing war in Ukraine, also informed this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is structured in three parts. The first is a narrative account and analysis of the safety and security issues that have arisen during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The second surveys the extant governance of safety at NPPs, existing international standards relating to NPPs in conflict zones and the perspective of militaries as to how NPPs are relevant to military operations. The third outlines recommendations for how NPPs can be rendered safer in conflict scenarios and how militaries can best ensure this during operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terms ‘nuclear safety’ and ‘nuclear security’ are used in this report according to their IAEA definitions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear safety refers to: ‘The achievement of proper operating conditions, prevention of accidents and mitigation of accident consequences, resulting in protection of workers, the public and the environment from undue radiation risks’.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear security refers to: ‘The prevention and detection of, and response to, criminal or intentional unauthorized acts involving nuclear material, other radioactive material, associated facilities or associated activities’ and ‘The prevention and detection of, and response to, theft, sabotage, unauthorized access, illegal transfer or other malicious acts involving nuclear material, other radioactive material or their associated facilities’.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of attacks on NPPs or supporting infrastructure during a military conflict, the distinction between nuclear safety and security can become blurred. Where either term may be relevant, the authors have used them together. When the discussion exclusively concerns one or the other, the terms have been used according to the above definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject of nuclear safety and security encompasses a broad range of issues, not all of which are covered in this report. The report’s primary focus is the threats to the safe operation of civilian nuclear facilities and to the physical integrity of nuclear facilities in conflict – and in the Ukrainian context in particular – with a view to understanding whether and how military operations may directly result in a radiological incident. As such, nuclear and radiological security issues as they pertain to the unauthorised removal of material from facilities – as well as matters related to unauthorised access to facilities, other than as part of military occupation of a facility – have been largely excluded from this report. Considerations of the application of IAEA safeguards at Ukrainian facilities are also not treated here. That is not to say that these matters are not relevant when discussing nuclear safety and security in the context of the war in Ukraine; in fact, there are serious, justified concerns over these issues. However, these were judged to be outside of this report’s scope and deserve to be treated comprehensively in a separate publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;risks-to-nuclear-safety-and-security-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Risks to Nuclear Safety and Security in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022, more than 50% of Ukraine’s domestic energy supply came from NPPs. The country hosts 15 operational nuclear reactors for energy generation, with an additional two reactors located at research facilities and four reactors in permanent shutdown at Chornobyl. As such, the significant likelihood and impact of attacks on the country’s nuclear infrastructure as part of the Russian invasion should have been evident from the start. In fact, the capture of Ukraine’s NPPs was a key objective in Russian military planning for the invasion. The Chornobyl NPP (ChNPP) and surrounding Exclusion Zone – the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster – is located on Ukraine’s border with Belarus and straddled the Russian military’s axis of advance from Gomel to Kyiv. Despite this, the Ukrainian government does not appear to have significantly adjusted its forces to defend its NPPs in the lead-up to the full-scale invasion, nor could the authors ascertain the existence of any extant procedures for defending the country’s operating NPPs under the conditions of a military conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical protection of Ukraine’s critical national infrastructure (CNI) – including its NPPs – is the responsibility of the National Guard of Ukraine, a unit of which is stationed at each NPP. Until the full-scale invasion, these units were structured, trained and equipped primarily to protect facilities from terrorist threats, theft and sabotage. This is largely in line with international standards, as the defence of NPPs against an invading military is not covered by the international nuclear safety and security regime. Ukraine had conducted a design-basis threat (DBT) for nuclear facilities, nuclear material, radioactive waste and other radiation sources in August 2015 and reportedly took into account the threats emanating from the Russian incursion into Donbas. DBTs for individual NPPs were also conducted in recent years. The authors also heard that an updated DBT assessment was apparently completed in 2022 but may not have been approved as of early 2023. The sensitive nature of these assessments has also meant that the authors could not confirm what specific threats were identified in 2015 or more recently. DBTs normally include only those threats to a nuclear facility’s physical security that the facility’s operator can reasonably address and focus on unauthorised access to the facility, sabotage, terrorist attack or theft of material. Defence against military attack is generally deemed to be beyond the DBT and is the primary responsibility of state authorities, and should be addressed as part of the country’s wider defence and security planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is clear that Ukrainian authorities were aware of threats to the security of nuclear facilities and material in the country following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the breakout of military activity in eastern Ukraine in 2014. In its ‘National Progress Report’ to the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit, Ukraine outlined efforts it had taken to strengthen the physical protection of nuclear facilities, nuclear material, radioactive waste and other sources of ionizing radiation. However, based on the threats and mitigation measures addressed in that report, the primary focus appears to have been dealing with lower-level threats such as political instability and sabotage, not accounting for a Russian military assault on – or occupation of – NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its 2021 report on the state of nuclear and radiological safety in Ukraine, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) noted that its assessment of threats to the physical protection of nuclear facilities and material in Ukraine considered Russian military activity in eastern Ukraine and ‘hybrid’ socio-political threats. According to the report, measures were taken to strengthen the physical protection of facilities and radioactive material in transport, facility access control was improved, and protection personnel underwent training for countering terrorism and sabotage threats. The report also highlighted the role of the National Guard in the protection of nuclear facilities and noted that inspections carried out that year concluded that the detachments responsible for NPP protection demonstrated ‘sufficient levels of readiness to perform their obligations in the prevention of acts of terrorism or sabotage against NPPs’. The authors could not ascertain any assessment as to the preparedness of the National Guard, or any other national preparations, to defend against full-scale military attack on facilities; although, due to its sensitive nature, such information is unlikely to be reported publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apparent failure to put in place a more substantial defence of NPPs against invading forces raises questions. Speaking to personnel responsible for the safety and security of Ukraine’s NPPs, it is evident that they had not enacted special measures in anticipation of conflict prior to 24 February 2022. The fact that senior Russian agents in Ukraine had obscured the threat to the Ukrainian authorities may partly explain this. Ukraine’s state security service (SBU) and the US government accuse Andriy Derkach, former head of the state enterprise Energoatom, of working as a long-term Russian agent along with senior SBU officers including Brigadier General Andriy Naumov who was also involved in the security of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Perhaps reflecting this internal distortion of the Ukrainian state’s risk perception, Ukraine’s minister of energy stated, not long before Russian forces captured the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), that the facility did not face a serious threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossing into Ukraine from Belarus on the morning of 24 February, Russian military forces seized the ChNPP within hours. As the Russians approached the NPP, Valentin Vitter, deputy head of security of the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, called the National Guard detachment responsible for the protection of the NPP and ordered its surrender, citing the risk to the station as the combined arms armies of Russia’s Eastern Military District rolled over the border. As a senior officer in the unit noted, ‘we were facing down a Blitzkrieg with pistols’. Two things quickly became evident: Moscow had long planned to seize the site; and the Russian military was woefully unprepared for operating around a nuclear facility. Russia’s special services seized the plant’s archives and all data held at the facility. The Ukrainian workforce was held hostage to maintain facility operations. Russian troops proceeded to establish a command post and supply base in close proximity to the NPP. Given the plentiful availability of structures suitable for establishing command and supply activities within the 30-km Exclusion Zone, the authors assess the decision to site these functions by the NPP to have been deliberate, and with the aim of using the facility as a shield. Alongside these clearly planned actions, Russian units dug trenches within the Exclusion Zone, digging up radioactive particles that had settled into the soil since the 1986 disaster, dragging them around the site and facility buildings and raising the radiation levels in the zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 3 March, Russian forces from the Southern Military District had reached the ZNPP and set about occupying the facility. Ukrainian forces marked the facility with spotlights at night, shining them directly upwards in an attempt to indicate its location for troops. Despite these measures, Russian forces hit the site’s training facility with tank rounds and caused a fire. The risk to the civilian population in the nearby towns from conducting active military defence of the NPP led the National Guard unit tasked with defending the facility to withdraw. As at the ChNPP, the Russians rapidly set about placing military supply vehicles and command-and-control systems in the ZNPP’s immediate vicinity. According to the IAEA, military equipment and stores were still present within the turbine halls of ZNPP Units 1 and 2 as of February 2023. Ukrainian plant employees were forced to continue operating the facility without rotation and under duress, with some being detained by Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russian forces departed from the ChNPP at the end of March 2022, the ZNPP remains under Russian control at the time of writing. The ongoing military operations around the facility, as well as the broader state of war across the country, pose significant threats to nuclear safety and security in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessing-safety-and-security-risks-during-the-invasion&quot;&gt;Assessing Safety and Security Risks During the Invasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threats that the military invasion posed to Ukraine’s nuclear facilities became clear immediately, with additional risks becoming apparent over time. On the day of the invasion and Russia’s seizure of the ChNPP, the IAEA lost connection with the site’s radiation monitoring network. Two days later, on 26 February, the ZNPP lost power supply from one of its four external power lines. On 4 March, Russian forces took control of the ZNPP and – as described earlier – a projectile struck the plant’s on-site training facility, resulting in a localised fire breaking out a few hundred metres from the reactor units. On 6 March, the ZNPP lost power supply from another one of its external power lines. Many other incidents have occurred over the past 15 months that have placed the safety and security of Ukrainian nuclear facilities at risk and raised international concerns over potential consequences. More recently, a Russian mine reportedly exploded near the engine room of a ZNPP reactor unit, and IAEA personnel stationed at the ZNPP in mid-April 2023 have reported hearing daily shelling. The risks of both an accidental and intentional radiological incident are considered below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strikes on Reactor Units&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1986 disaster at the ChNPP still looms large in public memory; as such, it is unsurprising that the accident has repeatedly been used as a point of reference when the potential consequences of Ukraine’s NPPs getting caught in the crossfire of the ongoing conflict are discussed. However, the likelihood of a 1986-scale disaster is low. Unlike the graphite-moderated RBMK (reaktor bolshoy moschnosti kanal’niy, high-power channel-type reactor) reactors at Chornobyl – now all decommissioned – Ukraine’s operating NPPs host water-cooled and moderated VVER (vodo-vodyanoi energeticheskiy reaktor, water-water power reactor) reactors, which are much less prone to some of the factors resulting from reactor malfunction and human error that caused and exacerbated the Chornobyl accident. The release and dispersion of highly radioactive material at a scale comparable to the Chornobyl disaster would require the penetration of a facility housing radioactive material – namely, a reactor or a spent-fuel storage facility – and the large-scale release of that material into the atmosphere and surrounding environment, likely assisted by plumes of smoke from a fire. While this is technically possible, the authors judge it to be unlikely for reasons described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An accidental hit on a reactor unit or a dry spent-fuel storage facility under the current state of military activity around Ukrainian NPPs is unlikely to cause a major radiological incident. The reactors currently operating at Ukrainian NPPs are located within reinforced containment structures, as per IAEA standards. These structures are designed to withstand significant internal and external hazards, including fires, explosions, earthquakes and radioactive release from other accidents. When it comes to loads from external impacts, the IAEA standards require reactor containment structures to be robust enough to withstand the force of an aircraft crashing into them. Ukraine’s dry spent-fuel storage facilities at the ZNPP and ChNPP are also protected in reinforced concrete structures. According to one recent ZNPP employee, a control cask at the NPP’s dry fuel storage – used to monitor the state of the other casks at the facility over time – was struck by artillery shrapnel during an exchange of fire but did not sustain significant damage. The authors could not verify the accuracy of this account, but it is consistent with expert analysis of the threat to dry spent-fuel storage from external impact. Furthermore, the spent fuel in dry storage facilities has been cooled for some time and is therefore significantly less radioactive than fuel inside a reactor core or the more recently withdrawn spent fuel stored in pool-type wet storage facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery fire, which has been the primary military threat to Ukraine’s NPPs since the full-scale invasion, is unlikely to cause any serious damage to the integrity of the containment or dry spent-fuel storage structures. The most widely employed fires throughout the conflict have been high-explosive artillery rounds intended to deliver fragmentation and overpressure effects against enemy personnel. Other classes of rounds employed – such as sensor-fused sub-munitions – are designed to find and strike objects with specific characteristics, such as vehicles, and would not be effective against the containment structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penetrating a containment structure and, subsequently, a reactor core would require applying significant and targeted firepower. Bunker-busting rounds such as HESH (high-explosive squash head) munitions, armour-piercing rounds including APFSDS (armour-piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot) kinetic penetrators and other direct-fire weapons including anti-tank guided weapons (ATGWs) could risk compromise to the facility, especially if repeated hits were delivered against the structure. Missiles with warheads intended to destroy hardened structures and especially hypersonic strikes from ballistic missiles could also pose a threat to the facility. Heavy air-delivered ordnance may compromise the containment structure. Nevertheless, this would likely require multiple hits, and since these are precision weapons or weapons employed against specific target classes, their use against an NPP would not be accidental. It is important to note that there is no effective means of preventing hits from ballistic missiles, since air and missile defences can only ensure partial protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, while deliberate compromise of Ukrainian reactor units or dry spent-fuel storage facilities resulting in a significant radiological incident is possible, incidental or accidental compromise is far less likely. The authors judge such an intentional strike unlikely but not unimaginable. Circumstances in which deliberate sabotage of nuclear facilities may occur are discussed later in this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two facilities at the ChNPP do not benefit from the same level of hardened protection as the reactors and dry storage sites, and may be more likely to sustain serious damage from lighter fire or accidental hits. These are the ChNPP’s Interim Spent Fuel 1 facility (ISF-1) and the New Containment Structure (NCS): the enormous concrete and steel sarcophagus containing the remnants of the reactor at Unit 4, destroyed during the 1986 disaster. Unlike the dry spent-fuel storage facilities at the ChNPP and the ZNPP, ISF-1 – a wet spent-fuel storage facility – is not hardened or housed within a reinforced containment structure. Constructing a containment structure to protect ISF-1 would be costly, time consuming and impractical to do while hostilities are ongoing and Russian forces and artillery remain stationed just a few kilometres away in Belarus. The most practical solution would be to move the spent fuel from ISF-1 into the significantly better reinforced new dry spent-fuel storage facility – ISF-2 at the ChNPP. In fact, the transfer of spent fuel from ISF-1 to ISF-2 began in November 2020, as the former is not designed for long-term fuel storage and is running out of space to accept new spent fuel. The process was expected to take 10 years under peacetime conditions. However, transfer of fuel stopped after the full-scale invasion. As the ChNPP is located within range of Russian artillery, moving fuel between the two facilities has been deemed too dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, although the NCS over Unit 4 is an impressive and robust structure designed to withstand earthquakes and class-3 tornados, it is not designed to withstand the same kinds of loads or impact as the containment structures of operational reactors. While Unit 4 at ChNPP has not been operational since the 1986 accident, what remains of the reactor is still highly radioactive. The installation of the NCS, which was completed in 2016, is designed to prevent the spread of radioactive particles from the damaged reactor. An attack on, and penetration of, the NCS and the old sarcophagus – which was built hastily over the Unit 4 reactor immediately following the accident and is now enclosed within the NCS – would cause the release of radioactive particles into the surrounding area and atmosphere. One member of the Ukrainian National Guard responsible for the protection of the ChNPP stated such an accident would essentially produce ‘a massive dirty bomb’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior staff of the Chornobyl Central Enterprise for the Management of Radioactive Waste raised similar concerns regarding potential attacks on the other radioactive waste storage facilities, such as the one at Buryakivka village in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. The authors also heard concerns over Ukraine’s ability to store any radioactive waste that may result from an accident at an NPP – whether at the ChNPP or at any of the country’s other facilities. According to the representatives of the Chornobyl Central Enterprise for the Management of Radioactive Waste, there is currently a shortage of storage for highly radioactive materials in Ukraine. New storage facilities can be constructed but any such effort will require extensive resources, as well as a lengthy risk assessment and other government review and approval processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks to NPP Power and Water Supply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The penetration of NPP structures housing radioactive materials by munitions is not the only risk to nuclear safety and security in Ukraine posed by the ongoing conflict. The interruption of systems critical to the safe operation of Ukraine’s NPPs – namely, the supply of water and electricity – creates significant risks and may result in a scenario similar to the 2011 accident at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi NPP. In that instance, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake caused the automatic shutdown and loss of external power supply at the NPP’s light water reactors. The earthquake was followed by a tsunami, which caused the failure of emergency power generators. With no power available to cool the reactor fuel, the units experienced nuclear fuel meltdown and hydrogen explosions (caused by zirconium reacting with the steam that resulted from rising temperatures in the reactors). Only one of the containment structures housing the NPP’s reactors was breached, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere. Nevertheless, more than 100,000 people had to be relocated as a result of radioactive contamination in the areas around the reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should reactors lose access to electricity or water supply for an extended period, Ukraine’s NPPs may face similar consequences. Since the start of the full-scale invasion and as of the drafting of this report, the ZNPP has lost external power supply six times – most recently on 9 March 2023. The ChNPP lost external power supply on 9 March 2022 and again on 23 November 2022, when Russian attacks on Ukraine’s national electrical grid also resulted in power outages at all of the country’s other NPPs. In all instances, on-site diesel power generators were able to maintain power supply to the reactor units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reliable supply of power is critical for the safe operation of nuclear reactors. Reactor fuel is extremely hot and must be constantly cooled to avoid melting and causing a Fukushima-like nuclear meltdown. The cooling process involves pumping cold water into the first circuit of the reactor and removing hot water with powerful pumps. The heat is then removed using a heat exchange system; at the ZNPP, this process currently relies on water from the Dnipro River. In the case of a power loss, these pumps stop operating, thus halting the circulation of water through the reactor’s first circuit, risking an overheating of the reactor core and subsequent melting of the reactor’s fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constant supply of coolant is needed even when reactors are in cold shutdown – as is the case with four of Ukraine’s 15 power units (one additional ZNPP reactor, previously in hot shutdown, is reportedly also being moved into cold shutdown as of the time of drafting) – as the nuclear fuel remains extremely hot. The same is true of spent fuel which has been removed from a reactor core; depleted fuel assemblies continue to release significant amounts of heat and must be cooled in water for some time before they can be transferred to dry fuel storage. However, as experts have rightly pointed out, the ZNPP reactors have been in shutdown for months, meaning their core temperatures are much lower than those of the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP at the time of the accident. As a result, they can be expected to remain safe for several days without power supply when in cold shutdown. Ukrainian authorities offered a similar assessment to the authors. The same is true of spent-fuel facilities, as spent nuclear fuel will have had time to cool since it was extracted from the reactors. In the case of dry spent-fuel storage facilities, the spent fuel will have also spent some time in wet storage and had additional time to cool before being transferred to dry storage casks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another risk emanating from a loss of power stems from the need to manage the hydrogen produced by the operation of the reactors to prevent a hydrogen explosion. As a result of radiolysis of the water in the reactor, hydrogen is produced and must be removed from the reactor building. Its removal depends on the operation of powerful turbines, which require a constant supply of power. Should these turbines stop operating, gas build-up may lead to a Fukushima-like hydrogen explosion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Fukushima accident, Ukrainian NPPs’ safety systems and resistance to accidents were stress tested. The authors reviewed reports detailing the results and found that the tests carried out at the ChNNP and ZNPP were primarily focused on extreme natural events. They also included considerations around the loss of water or power supply in extraordinary conditions, some of which may be relevant to current conditions. A series of recommendations for improving the safety and emergency response systems at the NPPs were put forward following the stress tests, and a National Action Plan for their implementation was developed in 2013. The recommendations included: the placement at NPPs of additional emergency diesel generators and mobile water pumps which can maintain water circulation for heat removal in case of a loss of external power; the strengthening of containment structures; and the installation of radionuclide filters and hydrogen recombiners to reduce the likelihood of hydrogen explosions. As of 2021, 80% of the safety improvement measures outlined in the National Action Plan had been completed, with the rest expected to be finalised by 2024. It is unclear how the Russian invasion has affected this timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While emergency diesel generators have been able to maintain power supply to Ukraine’s NPPs following every instance of external power supply loss so far, repeatedly relying on backup generators to maintain the safe operation of an NPP is a very dangerous game to play – especially in a conflict situation. The supply of diesel fuel at NPPs is not infinite and may be difficult to replenish if there are challenges in accessing the facility or there is a general diesel shortage across the country. According to one senior Ukrainian government official with responsibility for the country’s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) defence and security, in early March 2023, the ZNPP had sufficient fuel supply to keep the 18 emergency generators required to maintain power to its six reactor units for about 10 days. This figure is likely an estimate, as Ukrainian authorities have admitted to having limited information on the situation at the Russian-occupied ZNPP and it is possible that Russian personnel have supplied the facility with additional fuel. Fuel levels also vary over time, as fuel is used up by generator operation and new supply is delivered. In November 2022, the IAEA reported that the ZNPP had fuel to operate the diesel generators for about 15 days. The Ukrainian official’s comments and lack of definitive information on the fuel supply highlight the precarious power supply situation at the ZNPP. Emergency systems are also designed to prioritise the safe operation of the NPP, not the supply of power to secondary facilities such as administrative buildings and staff facilities. Loss of external power supply may therefore also pose challenges to staff wellbeing and their ability to conduct their work effectively. Staff morale and wellbeing issues pose a significant risk to the safe operation of NPPs and are discussed later in the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the threat posed by loss of power to Ukraine’s nuclear reactors, water supply to the ZNPP may also be at risk. In February 2023, the IAEA reported that water levels at the Kakhovka Reservoir on the Dnipro River have been dropping. The reservoir supplies water to the cooling ponds that are part of the system which is used to remove heat from the ZNPP’s reactors and spent-fuel storage facility. Water in the reservoir is normally maintained at a higher level than in the ponds, which facilitates the ponds’ replenishment and maintains reliable supply of water for cooling the reactor and spent-fuel storage, without which the reactor core and spent fuel risk overheating. In a statement in mid-February, Energoatom reported that water levels in the reservoir stood at 13.8 metres – well below their normal 16 metres. At the time, the head of Energoatom, Petro Kotin, stated that ‘a level of 12.8 meters will be [an] emergency, and 12 meters will be critical’. According to the authors’ consultations with two Ukrainian experts in early March 2023, including a recent ZNPP employee, water in the reservoir had by then dropped to below pool levels and may have even fallen below the 12.8-metres mark. The authors could not confirm this independently. As the weather begins to warm in the spring and summer, evaporation from the reservoir and pool may exacerbate the issue. However, in its report from 21 April, the IAEA noted that water levels had returned to 16.2 metres. In an earlier report, the Agency had attributed rising water levels to melting snow over the previous months. One senior expert with intimate knowledge of ZNPP operations consulted by the authors in March 2023 did not perceive the water levels cited at the time to pose an immediate threat to the safe operation of the facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staff Wellbeing and Safe Operation of NPPs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another critical threat to the safe operation of the country’s NPPs – which has received significant attention from the IAEA in its public reporting on nuclear safety and security in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion – is the duress under which NPP staff are having to operate. As the IAEA has highlighted, staff across all Ukrainian NPPs are having to carry out their duties while ‘dealing with the burdens imposed on their personal lives by the ongoing armed conflict, as well as with constant stress and anxiety’. Such conditions undoubtedly negatively affect staff’s ability to effectively perform what is – in normal times – high-pressure work that requires precision and the ability to confidently make high-stake decisions. Literature has pointed to the important role that the human factor plays in safe NPP operation. A 2021 report on the state of radiological and nuclear safety in Ukraine notes that 18.5% of abnormal events in NPP operations that year were due to human error. It was 13% the previous year. In 2017, it had peaked as high as 41%. Operating under the stresses of military conflict and occupation risks exacerbating the impact of human error in the operation of Ukraine’s NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is particularly acute at the ZNPP. The facility is located on the frontline of the conflict and has been under Russian occupation since early March 2022. As such, the NPP’s Ukrainian staff are having to carry out their duties amid an active war zone and in the presence of Russian military personnel. ZNPP staff on duty when Russian forces invaded the facility were not able to maintain normal rotations. Similarly, ChNPP staff remained on duty indefinitely when the Russian military took over the facility on 24 February 2022. As of March 2023, staff at the occupied ZNPP facility were reportedly being rotated regularly, although still working longer hours and more shifts. Several staff at the ZNPP – including the head of the power plant at the time, Ihor Murashov – have been detained. Media reporting has also recounted instances of torture of ZNPP staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One former ZNPP employee, who had been working at the NPP during the Russian occupation, recounted to the authors the psychological stress staff experienced. According to them, staff movement around the NPP – previously unrestricted – had to be coordinated with units of the Russian National Guard that had been stationed at the NPP after the invasion. At times when fire was being exchanged, NPP staff had to shelter in place – often for hours at a time. The occupying forces also reportedly did not allow staff to vacate technology or personal belongings from the parts of the facility which they moved into. Staff from the ChNPP also told the authors that, on returning to the NPP following Russian withdrawal, they found much of their personal belongings and facility equipment looted. What technology the Russian forces did not take with them from the ChNPP, they apparently destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian state-owned enterprise Rosatom is present at the ZNPP and has taken over management of the facility. The company was also present at the ChNPP during Russia’s occupation of the facility. Ukrainian authorities and experts, as well as the former ZNPP employee, confirmed to the authors that Rosatom has been forcing Ukrainian staff at the ZNPP to sign contracts with the company to retain their jobs (although it appears that Rosatom may have recently stopped requiring Ukrainian staff to be employed by the enterprise to continue working at the plant, presumably to mitigate staff shortages). Many Ukrainian staff refused and left employment at the ZNPP. Others have left the ZNPP and the nearby town of Energodar due to the obvious threats to safety and security inherent to an active conflict zone. Those that have chosen to continue working at the ZNPP face pressure – and may risk penalties – from Ukrainian authorities for collaborating with Russia. Despite reported attempts by Rosatom to recruit replacement staff – including nuclear experts from Russia – staff levels at the ZNPP are significantly below pre-invasion levels. Prior to the February 2022 invasion, the ZNPP hosted, by various accounts, between 10,000 and 11,000 staff; by the start of 2023, only 3,000 personnel reportedly remained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each reactor is unique and requires highly specialised staff specifically licensed to operate a given facility, making the replacement of ZNPP staff challenging. A number of Ukrainian experts also highlighted to the authors that the originally Soviet-designed ZNPP control rooms have since been modernised and differ significantly from Russian facilities, apparently making them challenging to navigate for Russian staff not trained to operate them. Finally, the threat of being sanctioned for participating in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine appears to be deterring potential replacement personnel from taking up employment at the ZNPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that, prior to the invasion, the ZNPP was operating with some redundancy in its staffing, and that certain staff were carrying out roles that would not have been directly critical to the safe operation of the facility and even less so in its current shutdown state. As such, current staff numbers may technically be sufficient for the operation of the ZNPP in its current state. However, there is no doubt that this significant reduction in staff and expertise creates additional pressures, stress and fatigue for the Ukrainian personnel still working at the ZNPP. Furthermore, the IAEA has reported that changes in the ZNPP management have resulted in ambiguous chains of command and have left staff to contend with conflicting instructions on how to operate the plant. Not only will such working conditions lead to greater levels of fatigue, anxiety and burnout among ZNPP staff than have already been observed, they pose an acute risk to the safe operation of the NPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly in an attempt to rectify Russian staff’s unfamiliarity with Ukrainian facilities, operators from Russian NPPs have been ‘receiving simulator and on the job training at the ZNPP’ and may be deployed to work at the facility following their training, according to the IAEA. While such an approach may address the challenge of staffing shortages at the ZNPP, it also helps normalise the presence, and continued deployment, of Russian personnel at an illegally occupied facility to replace Ukrainian staff who have left – or been forced out of their positions – as a result of the invasion. Unless expressly endorsed by relevant Ukrainian authorities – which is unlikely – the further deployment of Russian personnel to Ukrainian NPPs should not be acceptable to the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The IAEA’s Incident and Emergency Center (IEC) has been in touch with Ukrainian authorities since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, and the Agency has been providing consistent technical support to Ukraine throughout the conflict. The IAEA’s Board of Governors has passed three resolutions condemning Russian activities at Ukrainian nuclear facilities, and has called for Russia to cease its actions ‘against and at nuclear facilities in Ukraine’ and to allow Ukrainian authorities to regain control over its facilities. The IAEA has also been providing regular public updates on the situation in Ukraine, including through short news items on its webpage as well as through the publication of several detailed reports. Director General Rafael Grossi has been spearheading the Agency’s efforts and has articulated ‘Seven Pillars’ of nuclear safety and security in Ukraine derived from existing IAEA safety and security principles. The pillars include – and go beyond – many of the safety and security threats covered in this report. In September 2022, the Agency also put forward a list of seven recommendations to address the threat to nuclear safety and security in Ukraine, which included a call for the establishment of a nuclear safety and security zone around the ZNPP. However, the IAEA appears to have recently moved away from the idea of securing such a zone and is focusing on the protection of the facility itself under the current circumstances. The Seven Pillars and subsequent recommendations for addressing the nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine provide helpful direction for managing the current situation. However, they are fairly high level in scope and do not consider in any significant detail the military developments on the ground or the operational objectives of the warring parties. The challenges that these realities pose to establishing and enforcing a safety and security zone around the NPP are discussed later in this report.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Agency has also conducted several missions to Ukraine to assess the situation. The IAEA has had a permanent – albeit very limited – presence at the ZNPP since September 2022 and at all Ukrainian NPPs since January 2023. These IAEA Support and Assistance Missions consist of two–four IAEA staff and normally rotate every four–five weeks. However, it appears that the IAEA has recently encountered challenges in rotating its staff at the ZNPP. The mission teams are able to review the various aspects of facility operations and equipment related to safety and security – including the operation of diesel generators and supply of generator fuel, as well as facility connection to the external energy grid. The IAEA has also continued to carry out regular safeguard inspections at Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, as well as ad hoc inspections as needed – for instance, following Russian accusations of material being diverted for the production of a so-called ‘dirty bomb’.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite these efforts to support the safety and security of Ukrainian nuclear facilities, the Agency is ultimately limited in what it can do to resolve the challenges facing Ukrainian facilities and staff. IAEA staff on the ground in Ukraine can serve in observer and technical support roles, but do not have the capacity or mandate to address some of the most pressing challenges – including the threats that ongoing military operations pose to facilities. While ensuring the wellbeing of facility staff is a critical factor in maintaining the safety and security of facilities, the IAEA’s mandate and capabilities do not account for protecting NPP staff in a war scenario. Nevertheless, the Agency was reportedly in contact with relevant authorities following the detention of ZNPP head Ihor Murashov. The IAEA’s engagement with both Ukrainian and Russian authorities over the course of the war also means that it is in a unique position to act as an interlocutor between the two sides on issues of nuclear safety and security, at a time when no other lines of communication exist between the two countries on the subject.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-risks-for-ukraines-npps-during-the-conflict&quot;&gt;Future Risks for Ukraine’s NPPs During the Conflict&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although what has already transpired in Ukraine is deeply concerning, there are a range of risks that could grow over time and need to be mitigated. Russia continues to try to destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and it is highly likely that this will persist during the winter of 2023–24, assuming the conflict protracts through this period. The Russian defence industry is currently estimated to be able to construct approximately 40 cruise and ballistic missiles per month, with its limited remaining stocks allowing for larger salvos to be periodically generated. In combination with simpler systems such as Shahed-136 loitering munitions, it is reasonable to presume that Russia can continue to inflict serious damage on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure at least once per month. Despite some improvements in interception rates in late 2022, strikes in March 2023 – which resulted in the loss of external power to the ZNPP – showed that Russia was also able to adapt its tactics to achieve a large proportion of successful hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure primarily target transformer sub-stations and thermal power plants. Although these do not directly threaten NPPs, the destabilisation of the Ukrainian energy grid poses serious problems to the safe functioning of the NPPs. Operating NPPs have been forced to deal with surges in energy that they cannot distribute, forcing emergency shutdowns. Some of the acute risks were laid out earlier; however, there are also longer-term issues. Ukrainian experts – including a former ZNPP employee – as well as the IAEA – have expressed concerns over the long-term effect on the reactors of their repeated disconnection and reconnection to the main power grid. Abrupt emergency shutdowns are now avoided through pre-emptive shutdowns based on warning, reducing the damage to infrastructure. Nevertheless, nuclear reactors are designed to be kept operating, with shutdowns being rare events. Routine reactor shutdowns will invariably lead to wear on systems and, over time, are likely to increase the risk of irregularities in procedures or in the functioning of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another risk that will become acute over the longer term is Ukraine’s limited wet spent-nuclear-fuel storage capacity. The dangers of moving spent fuel from wet storage facilities at the various NPPs into dry storage at ISF-2 and the Centralised Spent Fuel Storage Facility at Chornobyl, as well as the on-site dry spent-fuel storage at the ZNPP, under war conditions mean that wet storage facilities are nearing capacity. Should capacity be reached, spent fuel will either have to be moved – at the risk of it coming under attack while in transit – or reactors will have to cease operation until wet storage capacity can be freed up. This could provide an opportune moment for Russia to manufacture a crisis. The international community should consider ways to ensure that there is an agreed mechanism to safely transport and store this fuel before time grants Russia a mechanism to weaponise the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has refrained from carrying out strikes intentionally targeting NPPs directly and there is no current indication that it intends to begin doing so. Depending on the nature of the incident, radiological release could have catastrophic effects for Ukrainian territory and communities in areas surrounding the NPPs, and it is likely that radioactive fallout would extend beyond Ukraine’s borders. In the case of attacks on the ChNPP or the ZNPP, the effects would almost certainly be felt in Russia. It is also unclear how Western states may react to a deliberate act of major nuclear sabotage by Russia in Ukraine. However, the possibility of a deliberate attack and widescale radiological release should not be ruled out entirely. Russian forces continue to be trained, and continue to hold significant amounts of reserve equipment, in Belarus. Further rounds of mobilisation could bring additional axes into play, even if only intended as a means of stretching Ukrainian defenders over a wider frontage. Russia’s SSO (special operations forces) have been observed conducting training in assaulting nuclear facilities with support from personnel recruited by the Russians who have previously worked at Ukrainian NPPs and have familiarity with the safety procedures. Russian authorities have also repeatedly messaged about the risks of false-flag attacks and a dirty bomb. Such messaging could indicate that Moscow is leaving the option of nuclear sabotage at the ZNPP on the table. At the time of writing, the authors assess that such Russian activity does not point to an imminent plan; rather, it indicates attempts to generate options. Nevertheless, the direct threat to Ukraine’s NPPs may increase if Russia feels that it is limited in its ability to suppress Ukrainian electricity generation while these facilities continue to operate and remain connected to Ukraine’s electricity grid, considering the importance of nuclear energy to the country’s power supply. Russia may also resort to deliberate attacks on nuclear facilities to coerce Ukraine’s partners through fear of escalation without resorting to nuclear weapons. It is worth stressing that the radiological release from an attack on an NPP would not be comparable to the consequences of a nuclear weapon detonation and the two should not be conflated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key outstanding question is how Russian forces may react if the Ukrainian armed forces successfully break through Russian defensive positions in Zaporizhzhia. The risk in this scenario could emanate from a direct assault on the facility by the Ukrainian armed forces as was attempted in October, or more likely from its encirclement as the Russian occupation of the site can be rendered unsustainable without fighting for control of the NPP directly. Retreating Russian forces may seek to engineer an incident at the facility – or threaten to do so – and blame the Ukrainian armed forces. There are two reasons why such an act may be considered. First, it could have the tactical effect of slowing down or stalling any Ukrainian exploitation of a breakthrough, requiring the Ukrainian armed forces to manage the consequences of the radiological incident instead. Second, Moscow may judge that the fear of a radiological incident among the international community could lead to a push by Western allies for Ukraine to accept a ceasefire, or desist from advancing on the Zaporizhzhia axis, at the risk of losing international support. The Ukrainian experts and officials the authors consulted in March 2023 consistently assessed that Russia is using its occupation of the ZNPP as blackmail (shantazh) to advance its military objectives in Ukraine. In reality, the West is unlikely to undertake such bargaining; however, there is a tendency towards optimism bias within Russian decision-making. The question is whether Russia convinces itself that it stands to benefit from causing a radiological incident at a Ukrainian NPP. The risk to the lives of its own personnel or Ukrainian civilians is unlikely to deter it from such a course of action. Although there is no evidence that a decision has been made in Moscow to carry out direct nuclear sabotage, variations of this kind of behaviour are widely discussed among Russian officials, including those in senior positions relating to the conduct of Russia’s occupation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be tempting to look at the various threats to nuclear safety and security that Russia has created in Ukraine as a technical issue which can be mitigated by the deployment of additional safety equipment or over which Russia may be willing to negotiate for short-term improvements of the situation. In reality, Ukraine’s nuclear infrastructure continues to be held at risk by an actor that has already shown a limited regard for nuclear safety and security, with its behaviour only seriously constrained by the perceived practical risks as compared with the anticipated reward. In this context, mechanisms for improving behaviour move into the realm of deterrence or the infliction of consequences for violations of international standards and law which are able to shape behaviour. This requires a more proactive approach beyond the capabilities and capacity of international organisations such as the IAEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;perspectives-on-npp-safety-in-conflict&quot;&gt;Perspectives on NPP Safety in Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having considered the risks to NPPs in Ukraine, it is important to examine the state of nuclear safety in conflict more broadly. This chapter, therefore, covers two issues. First, it examines the history of NPPs in conflict and the established requirements for ensuring their safety in this context. Second, it examines NPPs from a military viewpoint and outlines the effects a military may plan to deliver against NPPs. This chapter examines effects that are consistent with international law as well as those that are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;broader-context-for-the-safety-of-npps-in-conflict&quot;&gt;Broader Context for the Safety of NPPs in Conflict&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current situation in Ukraine is the first time that operational NPPs have come under direct fire or been occupied by an invading military force. However, it is not the first time that civilian nuclear infrastructure has been caught in the crosshairs of a military conflict. During the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s, the Bushehr NPP in Iran was shelled by Iraqi forces, although the facility had not yet been loaded with nuclear fuel. Reactors in Iraq and Syria have also been destroyed in military strikes; both were struck before they could become operational. More relevant to the current situation in Ukraine is the 1991 experience of the Krško NPP in Slovenia, which found itself in the proximity of military clashes following Slovenia’s declaration of independence from Yugoslavia – although, unlike in the case of the Ukrainian NPPs, the facility was never directly attacked or occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of today’s operating NPPs are in areas that are prone to conventional military conflict, raising questions over the risks that these facilities may face in the future. This may include the Bushehr NPP in Iran and the UAE’s Barakah NPP in the case of a military conflict in the Gulf. An escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan, or between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, may put South Asian and Armenian NPPs at risk, respectively. The resumption of North Korean missile tests in 2022 and 2023 is also a timely reminder of the potential for strikes on NPPs and supporting critical infrastructure in East Asia, including operational reactors in Japan and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the international community becomes increasingly conscious of the need to move to sustainable energy sources and aims to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, nuclear power’s global role – and, consequently, the number of NPPs and small modular reactors (SMRs) – is likely to grow. In its 2022 projections for nuclear electricity generation, the IAEA estimated that nuclear generating capacity may reach 873 GW(e) by 2050 – more than double current levels – in a high-case scenario. In a low-case scenario, nuclear power generation capacity remains at about current levels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has also noted the important role that nuclear power is likely to have in a global transition to zero-carbon emissions by 2050; the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions Scenario suggests a doubling of global nuclear power generation capacity from 2022 to 2050. According to the World Nuclear Association, 60 additional nuclear reactors were under construction worldwide as of March 2023. The US, Russian and Chinese militaries have also expressed an interest in the use of SMRs for military purposes, which could see the deployment of these smaller, easier-to-build reactors to forward operating bases in support of military operations. Understanding the risks to nuclear energy infrastructure from military conflict – including why and how military forces may target or occupy nuclear power units – and identifying how these risks can be prevented and mitigated must be a key component of global efforts to strengthen nuclear safety and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these trends, there are no extant international regulations for operating NPPs in a conflict context. As per IAEA standards on the physical protection of nuclear materials and facilities (INFCIRC/225/Revision 5), procedures for the physical protection of Ukraine’s NPPs would have been developed based on a threat assessment and the articulation of a DBT. A DBT is meant to inform nuclear security efforts by considering the threats of ‘unauthorized removal of nuclear and other radioactive material or sabotage’ by insider and external actors. Physical protection measures should then be developed based on that assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INFCIRC/255/Revision 5, which sets out recommendations for DBTs and other measures for the physical protection of nuclear facilities and material, is limited in the scope of risks it addresses and does not account for threats posed to nuclear safety and security in the context of a military conflict. The documents limit their recommendations to the assessment of the risks of unauthorised removal of nuclear or radiological material with the intent to construct a nuclear explosive device or which could lead to subsequent dispersal of the material, as well as risk of sabotage. Some of these risks are likely to be relevant in a military-conflict scenario; for instance, Section 5 of INFCIRC/255/Revision 5 refers to ‘stand-off attacks’ as a type of sabotage: defined as ‘An attack, executed at a distance from the target nuclear facility or transport, which does not require adversary hands-on access to the target, or require the adversary to overcome the physical protection system’. However, the document does not account for the kind of sustained military activity and occupation of facilities by invading military forces that Ukrainian NPPs currently face. Nuclear facility operators cannot reasonably be expected to respond to threats to nuclear facilities outside of what is articulated in the DBT; anything outside of it – including military attack – is the responsibility of state authorities as part of broader national security and defence planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (and its Amendment) (CPPNM) and the International Convention on the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism (ICSANT) – Ukraine is a signatory to both – also include provisions addressing sabotage of nuclear facilities, similar to the threats Ukrainian NPPs currently face. Notably, Russia proposed the draft ICSANT to the UN General Assembly in 1996, arguing that the earlier CPPNM did not go far enough in countering the danger of nuclear terrorism. However, both the CPPNM and the ICSANT explicitly state that the conventions do not cover the activities of armed forces during an armed conflict or military exercise. Contained in an extensive series of publications, IAEA standards on nuclear safety and security set out other guidance and expectations for governments on the protection – as well as the safe design, operation and handling – of nuclear and radioactive materials and relevant facilities. Some of these are likely to be helpful in preventing and addressing certain threats to nuclear safety and security that countries may encounter in a military conflict. Yet, none have been designed for express application in a military conflict scenario or to respond to the full range of threats and challenges that emerge in such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;npps-in-military-planning&quot;&gt;NPPs in Military Planning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to shape the approach militaries take towards NPPs must consider how NPPs are likely to be approached in military planning. First, there is the existing legal framework governing how militaries should operate in relation to NPPs. Second, there is the matter of how militaries are likely to operate within this framework to pursue advantage. Third, there is the question of militaries that disregard existing IHL provisions to pursue military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of provisions within the laws of armed conflict (LOAC) and IHL protects NPPs from being military targets. Article 56 of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions Protocol I prohibits attacks against ‘works and installations containing dangerous forces’, including NPPs. However, an exception to the provision lifts this protection if the NPP ‘provides electric power in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support’, as well as for military objectives in its vicinity ‘if they are used in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support’. At the same time, Article 56 maintains that ‘the civilian population and individual civilians shall remain entitled to all the protection accorded them by international law’, which may be inconsistent with the earlier exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article 15 of Protocol II also prohibits attacks on NPPs ‘even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population’, with no exceptions. However, the 1987 explanatory note to the article highlights the provision’s focus on expected civilian losses, noting that ‘objects are not protected in themselves, but only to the extent that their destruction would release forces dangerous for the civilian population’ and that ‘assuming such a work or installation were a military objective, it could be attacked as long as the civilian population were not seriously endangered thereby’. The note goes on to explain that ‘severe losses’ is a term taken from military terminology and assessments should be made in good faith. Furthermore, the provisions in the Additional Protocols refer only to nuclear power generating stations and do not explicitly extend protections to other nuclear infrastructure, such as nuclear research reactors or spent-fuel storage facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Geneva Protocols, the IAEA and UN Security Council have also condemned attacks on nuclear facilities. For instance, the 1985 IAEA General Conference passed a resolution on the ‘Protection of Nuclear Installations Devoted to Peaceful Purposes Against Armed Attack’, which noted that the General Conference ‘considers that any armed attack on and threat against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter, international law and the Statute of the Agency’. The issue of attacks on nuclear infrastructure was also addressed at the 1985 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), with specific reference to the threats to security and the international safeguards regime posed by the 1981 Israeli attack on the Osirak reactor in Iraq. In 2009, the IAEA General Conference pointed to its earlier resolutions addressing attacks on nuclear facilities and reiterated the importance of protecting nuclear installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOAC concerning attack proportionality and the protection of civilians are also relevant in this instance. Protections against attacks on NPPs have been included in Rule 42 of customary IHL, which concerns itself with attacks on works and installations containing dangerous forces. As others have pointed out elsewhere, Russia has included similar prohibitions against attacks on objects containing dangerous forces in its military manuals and in its application of IHL; the latter makes specific reference to nuclear power stations but includes a caveat to their protection similar to that of the Geneva Conventions. A 1996 Russian Constitutional Court opinion also confirmed Russia’s obligation to the protection of facilities housing dangerous forces as per Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these provisions, there is a range of military acts that is both consistent with a state’s legal obligations and yet poses risks to NPP safety. Conventional military operations are fundamentally the use of physical force to compel an adversary to comply with the will of the party applying the military instrument. To achieve this, a military must incapacitate the target’s ability and will to resist. Almost all modern military concepts emphasise trying to simultaneously apply as much pressure on the target military and state as possible. The Chinese concept of Systems Confrontation is premised on simultaneously targeting an adversary’s combat forces, logistics, command and control, infrastructure, and other critical bottlenecks in its operations. Network Centric Warfare, which – despite being superseded as doctrine – remains embedded in the logic of NATO operations, endeavours to disrupt the enemy deep, denying command and control, then logistics, to enable the defeat of military units in detail. The application of these concepts has always produced attacks on CNI. In the context of initial break-in operations to suppress and destroy enemy air defences, for example, military necessity requires the disruption of enemy command and control, part of which is enabled by the supply of power. NATO struck power infrastructure in Serbia, for example, as part of its air campaign against the country. It is therefore almost inevitable that states will, in the opening phase of operations, attack another’s electricity grid; if that state depends heavily on NPPs, this will force it into operating from reversionary generators. It is important to distinguish this kind of attack on an energy grid – carried out in support of a specific military line of effort that is temporally confined – from the deliberate destruction of civilian energy infrastructure because of its importance for the civilian population, as Russia is carrying out in Ukraine. However, the distinction may not always be clear and the two objectives need not be mutually exclusive. Russia’s concept of Strategic Operations for the Destruction of Critically Important Targets is a more systematic approach to CNI destruction than severing access to it to enable military manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because a state’s sovereignty requires defence of its CNI, states will seek to defend NPPs. Insofar as these forces are co-located with the facility, their being targeted will risk incidental damage to the facility and – depending on the context – militaries may judge that such attacks are both militarily necessary and proportionate in terms of the risk of a radiological incident. It is also important to note that emergent military concepts – such as the UK’s Multi-Domain Integration – explicitly emphasise the role of non-military tools as components of a national struggle and in doing so could cause the enablers for these tools to become valid targets. This harnessing of traditionally non-military tools to further military ends may reasonably justify some targets being classified as military objectives consistent with the principle of distinction that would historically have been classified as civilian objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to assume that conflict will affect NPPs in the future and that an outright prohibition on militaries affecting NPPs would be unworkable. Nevertheless, militaries plan based on the effects they wish to deliver, and an examination of those that may lead military operations to affect NPPs is useful to determine what regulations might allow militaries to operate while maximising NPP safety. These effects include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deny energy to an opposing military.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deny energy to an adversary state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure energy production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure nuclear facilities from access by hostile actors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix enemy forces around a piece of CNI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppress or destroy military systems operating from the territory surrounding an NPP.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of regulating how these effects are delivered, it is important to note that the first two are best achieved by attacking the connections between an NPP and the wider grid, rather than the NPP itself. Others are in tension. For example, regulations must allow a military to maintain close enough proximity to a facility to offer it protection, while also reducing the likelihood that its presence would legitimise the site as a military target and thereby risk accidental damage to critical structures. Where a site is clearly being used for military purposes, providing energy to military systems, it forgoes protection. It is therefore important that states do not game the threat to civilians from the proximity of an NPP to protect a site that is being exploited for military purposes. Within this context, it is clear that any proposals for the establishment of a large nuclear safety and security zone around Ukraine’s NPPs, where military forces would be prohibited from operating, would be largely unworkable in the current conflict, as such a zone would prevent the effective control of the site or its being protected by defensive systems. The Energy Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences recently called for the establishment of a demilitarised zone around the ZNPP with a radius of 40 km, where only the presence of Russian military forces would be permitted; it should go without saying that such a suggestion cannot be treated seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must also be acknowledged that some actors have little interest in complying with regulations, even if they are signatory to them. For instance, by targeting NPP-supporting infrastructure, occupying NPPs with military forces and reportedly placing military systems within reactor buildings, a case can reasonably be made that Russia is in violation of IHL provisions prohibiting the targeting of nuclear facilities. Iran, for its part, has prepared long-range strike systems as its primary means of deterrence by holding CNI across the Gulf at risk. In the context of such actors – which are willing to disregard IHL and other international standards – the question should not be how to strengthen or expand regulations and standards, but instead how to deter their targeting NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why such a state may target an NPP. First, a state may threaten this as part of its deterrence posture. Second, it may aim to damage an NPP to tie down adversary resources. Third, a state may threaten an NPP because a radiological incident could deny the adversary an axis of advance. Fourth, a state might target an NPP as a means of compellence because of the fear it instils in a target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militaries also have interests that constrain what they may be prepared to do near NPPs. First, a major incident at an NPP may create a humanitarian and ecological disaster that will require the diversion of considerable resources from a military’s main effort, and possibly more than the effect on the enemy’s forces. Second, an accident at an NPP risks creating a radiological hazard to friendly troops and slowing down operations, absorbing significant and scarce CBRN capabilities, or denying axes. Third, a destroyed or damaged NPP may prevent the facility from being used to provide power for the territory brought under control by a military after the completion of combat operations. Finally, the international backlash against a state that causes an incident at an NPP may bring about its isolation and have secondary consequences that are disproportionate to the military interests in striking or seizing the facility. Ultimately, however, constraining an unscrupulous military from targeting an NPP must be achieved through deterrence rather than regulation, although regulation can increase the difficulty and reduce the effect of any activity deliberately targeting an NPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, therefore, there are a range of effects militaries may plan to deliver in relation to NPPs that pose challenges to their safety. Some of these effects are legitimate within the LOAC and IHL. Other actors may have incentives to disregard their legal obligations. It is therefore necessary to establish regulations for military operations affecting NPPs that allow the military to achieve its legitimate objectives while minimising the safety issues raised through its conduct. At the same time, to account for actors that may disregard regulations, deterrence strategies will need to be developed that consider the particular military objectives the attack on NPPs and supporting infrastructure is meant to achieve and which deny that objective or make it too costly to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-improving-the-safety-and-security-of-npps-in-conflict&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Improving the Safety and Security of NPPs in Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations outlined in this chapter to improve the safety and security of NPPs in conflict can be divided into three groups. First, the authors put forward immediate recommendations for improving the safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine. Second, the authors outline recommendations for the alteration of NPP design, and security and safety considerations to better ensure their safety in conflict scenarios. Third, recommendations are identified for the conduct of militaries around civilian NPPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ensuring-nuclear-safety-and-security-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Ensuring Nuclear Safety and Security in Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several measures of immediate importance that should be a priority for the international community in its response to the threats to nuclear safety and security in Ukraine. The authors’ recommendations, based on the analysis presented in this report, are outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Ensure the personal safety and welfare of staff at NPPs, including sufficient staffing levels.&lt;/strong&gt; International pressure on Russia – and Rosatom in particular – should be maintained and increased to allow workers at the ZNPP (and any facilities that may be occupied in the future) to rest and rotate frequently, and to be able to carry out their work without undue pressure. Ukrainian staff who wish to continue working at the ZNPP should not be forced to sign contracts with Rosatom; this may help reduce some of the stress that Ukrainian staff who do not wish to work for Rosatom face, and may allow the ZNPP to retain a greater number of staff to ensure its safe operation. Ukrainian authorities should take a carefully considered case-by-case approach to responding to Ukrainian ZNPP staff decisions to cooperate with occupying forces or Rosatom in the operation of the ZNPP, weighing staff obligations to ensuring the safe operation of the NPP against the normal expectations that staff should not assist Russian occupation and would be punished for doing so. The IAEA should work with Ukrainian and Russian authorities, as well as the wider international community, to assess and identify solutions to any shortage of licensed staff available to safely operate the ZNPP in its current condition. Any solutions to the staffing challenge should not involve the presence of technical staff at Ukrainian NPPs that have not been approved by Ukrainian authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Ensure sufficient licensed Ukrainian staff are ready to resume operations at the ZNPP following Russian withdrawal from the facility.&lt;/strong&gt; In the event of a withdrawal of Russian military forces and other personnel from the ZNPP, Ukrainian authorities must be ready to provide the necessary staff and support to ensure the facility continues safe operation. As had been the case following Russian withdrawal from the ChNPP, looted and damaged equipment and systems will have to be reconstituted, which may require support from international partners. Ukrainian authorities should ensure that the necessary measures are in place domestically and should work with international partners to prepare for a rapid return of the ZNPP to safe operation by Ukrainian staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Facilitate the safe transport of spent nuclear fuel to dry storage facilities, where appropriate.&lt;/strong&gt; Spent nuclear fuel that is ready to be moved to dry storage facilities at the ChNPP and the ZNPP should be transferred to the appropriate facility and thus make room for the storage of additional spent fuel as necessary. Spent fuel currently being stored at the wet storage facility in ChNPP should be moved to the ISF-2 dry storage facility, where it will benefit from greater physical protection, as soon as possible. Measures need to be put in place to allow these transfers to take place safely. Ukraine’s National Guard is normally responsible for the safety and security of nuclear fuel transport; under the current circumstances, escorts by international representatives – from the IAEA or other UN bodies – could be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4: Assess availability of highly radioactive waste storage facilities and certify additional storage if needed.&lt;/strong&gt; If necessary, risk assessments and other approval processes for the construction of additional highly radioactive waste storage facilities should be expedited by Ukrainian authorities. Necessary resources for the rapid construction of additional facilities should be made available – potentially with support from international partners. This will help ensure that highly radioactive waste resulting from any radiological incident that may occur at a Ukrainian NPP can be managed quickly. Should this additional storage prove unnecessary upon the conclusion of military hostilities in Ukraine, the facilities may be used to store radioactive waste from the ChNPP or for the normal operation of Ukrainian facilities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 5: Provide CBRN, emergency response and other necessary equipment, training and support to the Ukrainian military, emergency services and NPP operators.&lt;/strong&gt; This includes providing support for the restoration of radiation monitoring and emergency response equipment that Russian forces looted or damaged at the ChNPP. Such support should be a priority to mitigate or minimise the impact of radiological incidents in Ukraine, should they occur. This approach may also reduce the potential tactical impact of a deliberate incident instigated by Russia and thereby make it less attractive. Such support could be provided by the IAEA (including continued support from the IEC), individual governments or multilateral organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 6: Provide regular updates on the supply of fuel for emergency generators at Ukrainian nuclear facilities, as well as the water levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir.&lt;/strong&gt; The IAEA has provided intermittent updates on the water levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir, which supplies water used to cool the ZNPP reactors. The IAEA should provide regular public updates on the reservoir’s water levels and other factors that may affect the supply of water to the ZNPP. Updates on Kakhovka Reservoir water levels in the Agency’s last two updates on nuclear safety and security in Ukraine (dated 13 April and 21 April) are welcome. Similarly, the supply of diesel fuel for the emergency generators at each NPP should be made public and regularly updated. IAEA staff stationed at various Ukrainian NPPs – especially the ZNPP, where Ukrainian authorities have limited situational awareness – should be permitted to ascertain and report this information. Should a change be observed in water supply or the availability of diesel fuel, the IAEA should seek to establish and report on the cause. The Agency should also publicise the consequences of key thresholds being crossed to increase the reputational harm for whoever causes such an event to occur and to prepare the ground for the international community to demand robust action be taken if critical support systems – such as water supply – are compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 7: Ensure the safe supply of diesel fuel, maintenance parts and services, and other materials necessary for the safe operation of Ukraine’s NPPs.&lt;/strong&gt; These supplies should be allowed to move freely and regularly into all Ukrainian facilities, to ensure that all safety systems, including emergency generators and water pumps, can continue to operate for extended periods of time as needed. The stress put on the reactors due to frequent disconnections from the power grid is likely to lead to an increased need for maintenance, which must be met. Fuel and component delivery to the ZNPP may require the establishment of a dedicated ‘green corridor’ or international escort – for instance, by the IAEA or another UN agency. As per the previous recommendation, the cause of the falling levels in the Kakhovka Reservoir must be ascertained and addressed. All options for ensuring constant water supply to the ZNPP must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 8: Penalise Rosatom staff operating at the ZNPP – and which had been present at the ChNPP – for participating in Russia’s occupation of Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; Rosatom management and staff presiding over and involved in the operation of the ZNPP – and which had been present at the ChNPP – are not licensed by Ukrainian authorities to operate these facilities and have taken over the management of an illegally occupied facility. National governments, multilateral organisations (namely, the EU) and the international community (through the IAEA and its Board of Governors) must condemn this activity in the strongest terms. Rosatom executives and any of their staff involved in the operation of Ukrainian facilities should be sanctioned by Ukraine’s partners. They should be excluded from participation in any international activities or forums that do not exclusively concern the safe and secure operation of the ZNPP with the ultimate objective of returning it to Ukrainian management and operation. Such measures will be not only punitive in nature but will also help to deter further Russian staff from accepting work at occupied Ukrainian facilities. Penalising and discouraging Russian personnel from operating occupied Ukrainian NPPs risks contradicting Recommendation 1, but the solution to insufficient staffing levels should not further reinforce Russian control of facilities. As per Recommendation 1, the IAEA should work with Ukrainian and Russian authorities, as well as the wider international community, to appropriately staff the facility with qualified Ukrainian or international staff that are not collaborating with the Russian occupation of the facility and which have been approved by Ukrainian authorities. At the same time, customers of Russian nuclear fuel, enriched uranium and other nuclear-energy-related goods and services around the world – including in the US and Western Europe – should look to diversify away from Russian supplies as soon as is practicable. This will avoid further enabling entities (namely, Rosatom) directly engaged in supporting the Russian occupation of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 9: Establish deterrence against a deliberately manufactured radiological incident by making clear to Russia that any such incident would be followed by a massive response to mitigate damage and expanded support for Ukraine’s war effort.&lt;/strong&gt; As discussed earlier, Russia may judge a radiological incident in the event of its withdrawal from the ZNPP to be an attractive option – a serious yet controllable escalation. Deterrence must therefore be established by making clear that any such incident will have consequences that are contrary to Russia’s interests. The best means of doing this would be for Ukraine’s international partners to emphasise that a major radiological incident at the ZNPP will lead to the deployment of international CBRN troops to assist Ukraine in dealing with the response – and that an attack on these troops will be considered an attack on the states that deployed them. Thus, Russia must believe that any such incident will not reduce the international community’s support for Ukraine. Instead, such an incident would be the basis for expanded support for Kyiv and the direct offer of assistance by deployed personnel from Ukraine’s partners. Given that the Russian leadership knows that it is not able to confront NATO forces, such a position should deter it from believing that Russia could control the consequences of any such action and therefore undermine any calculus that favours rewards over risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparatory-measures-for-ensuring-security-of-npps-in-future-conflict&quot;&gt;Preparatory Measures for Ensuring Security of NPPs in Future Conflict&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the immediate threats to nuclear safety and security in Ukraine, national governments and the IAEA should make preparations to respond to similar threats to nuclear infrastructure arising in future conflicts elsewhere in the world. To this end, the authors recommend the following lines of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 10: Consider, and adopt the necessary prevention and mitigation measures for, state-level military conflict and occupation of nuclear facilities by an invading force as part of national threat assessments, DBTs, and wider national defence and security planning.&lt;/strong&gt; The highly sensitive nature of nuclear safety and security threat assessments, DBTs, and broader state-wide national security and defence planning means that it is difficult to ascertain in the public domain the degree to which military conflict and occupation of nuclear facilities is already considered as part of these processes. This should be rectified in countries where such situations have not been considered; national and facility-specific threat assessments should be conducted to account for the threat of military attack and occupation to nuclear safety and security. Nuclear operators and regulators, intelligence agencies and defence departments must work closely in this process; responsibilities and lines of communication should be clearly defined. National response to military attack and occupation of nuclear facilities will almost certainly fall outside of the DBT and the mandate of nuclear operators or the bodies tasked with nuclear facilities’ safety and security in peacetime. However, DBTs should nevertheless include considerations around the threat of military attack and occupation. The resilience of nuclear energy infrastructure – including supply chains and fuel storage and transfer – should be strengthened accordingly. Nuclear regulators, facility operators and protection forces should be prepared to operate facilities safely and securely in conflict situations, with appropriate support from the armed forces. Best practices should be shared among states, while remaining conscious of the limitations that the sensitive nature of these threat assessments and planning pose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 11: Include considerations on military attack and occupation of nuclear facilities in the IAEA’s nuclear safety and security standards.&lt;/strong&gt; The IAEA should prioritise the articulation of recommendations on assessing, preventing and mitigating the threats to nuclear safety and security posed by military attack and occupation of nuclear facilities and supporting infrastructure. These recommendations should supplement IAEA guidance on the physical protection of nuclear facilities and material from theft and sabotage, as well as other IAEA guidance on nuclear safety and security. Recommendations should be as specific as possible and may include additional guidance on: improving the physical resilience of nuclear facilities and supporting infrastructure; managing frequent loss of power and emergency shutdown of facilities; the establishment of supply corridors and lines of deconfliction between the warring parties; the IAEA’s role in supporting the safety and security of facilities in wartime; and staff wellbeing and procedures for the operation of facilities with limited staff. It may also be necessary to modify existing practices. For example, the regulations for ensuring the safety of a site during an earthquake may involve the use of sensors and autonomous systems that military activity could trigger inappropriately – and these systems may require reversionary modes or overrides. Another critical area for regulation should be the management of systems data at a site when this may be of intelligence value to the warring parties but also important for the site’s safe operation. The IAEA’s experience in supporting nuclear safety and security in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion – including the deployment of its Support and Assistance Missions, as well as the articulation of the Seven Pillars of nuclear safety and security and related recommendations – can inform future guidance and standards. The experience of Ukrainian authorities, experts, military personnel and NPP operators should also be leveraged to inform these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 12: Harden physical protections in the design of new NPPs. It is important to note that no amount of air and missile defence can assure an NPP from deliberate direct strike.&lt;/strong&gt; Site hardening, however, can significantly reduce the threat from such strikes. At present, the containment facilities for reactors and dry spent-fuel storage are likely sufficient to protect sites from most conventional munitions classes, except for those deliberately designed to penetrate concrete structures. States investing in hypersonic glide vehicles may expand the range of munitions and the number of vectors from which direct strikes threaten the integrity of containment. Nevertheless, prioritising innovation in the design and construction of smaller reactors that may be easier to protect, the development and deployment of more accident-tolerant reactor fuel, and subterranean structures could improve the resilience of these sites. The building up of earth around the perimeter of reactor units and other sensitive facilities may be a more realistic and economically viable solution in the short-to-medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally important is the resilience of safety and emergency response systems, such as back-up generators (and their fuel supply) and mobile pumps, the lines connecting the generators to the reactor units, the piping to the water source for the site, as well as radiation monitoring and emergency response systems. These could all be struck or otherwise disconnected in a conflict scenario; burial of this equipment where possible may be an effective means of significantly increasing its survivability. Because ventilation points become key points of vulnerability to military strikes for any significantly hardened or subterranean structure, ensuring that they do not pose a threat would be a key challenge to address ahead of future NPP design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 13: Harden existing NPPs.&lt;/strong&gt; Hardening existing structures against deliberate strike can be extremely difficult and resource intensive; but some modifications can likely be made to better protect sites from incidental strike. This would include hardening plant support systems such as generators and back-up fuel storage. Other measures that would significantly improve the resilience of these sites is the clearing of a surrounding area from fire risk and the construction of a glacis around the perimeter to shield the site from direct fire. Such a glacis would significantly reduce the risk of rounds from units in contact – especially kinetic penetrators and ATGMS that could pose a penetration risk to critical NPP facilities – from overflying targets in combat and striking the facility. This would not remove the threat from indirect fire, but the hardening of key support machinery and removal of flammable materials should reduce the risk from anything but deliberate strikes. Hardening water pipes from the facility so that they are dug into the earth and are not at risk of being ruptured by the passage of heavy armoured vehicles over them is also advisable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;measures-for-minimising-risk-to-npps-during-military-operations&quot;&gt;Measures for Minimising Risk to NPPs During Military Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although states can modify or design NPPs to reduce the risks to the facility in conflict, it is also necessary for militaries to agree on rules for operating around and fighting over NPPs that account for the safety of these sites. The following recommendations are intended to significantly improve the safety of NPPs without undermining the logic of military operations or allowing the rules to be gamed in such a way as to encourage agreement violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 14: Establish a 1-km demilitarised zone around NPPs.&lt;/strong&gt; The notion of a demilitarised zone around NPPs has merit as a means of distinguishing military targets from civilian objects. As such, it would be sensible for the IAEA to reprise efforts to establish a nuclear safety and security zone around the ZNPP. Serious consideration must be given to what such a zone may look like in practice in this particular instance – and what principles can be applied for establishing such zones around NPPs in future conflicts. A large demilitarised zone is likely impractical. To use a nominal example of 10 km, this would mean that a hypothetical NPP near Narva would prevent military manoeuvre across one third of Estonia’s border with Russia. It is unlikely that either Russia or NATO would accept such a canalisation of its battlespace in conflict. A smaller demilitarised zone, however, would be sufficient to reduce the likelihood of accidental strikes on the station and is more promising. Given that the least accurate artillery classes tend to have a circular error probable at maximum range of less than 300 metres, even accounting for a major error of judgement by fire controllers, a 1-km demilitarised zone seems both sufficient and viable. This would also create a standard for the distance from the site of the glacis proposed earlier. The establishment of such a demilitarised zone also requires that no military equipment – including defensive systems – be stationed at the NPP or in the demilitarised area around it. By agreeing that military units defending a site should not come within this zone, it would be possible for a military to screen and defend the site, cover it with air defence, and perform other functions, without locating military units sufficiently close to draw fire that could put the NPP at risk. This would also enable an attack to engage defenders and to contest control of the points of ingress and egress – thereby contesting control of the site – without needing to put manoeuvre forces on to the facility. Responsibility for site safety internally would thus need to be agreed to be civilian or paramilitary, with an agreement that agencies should not carry weapon classes other than small arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a demilitarised zone would also remove ambiguity around the conditions granted to NPPs under the Geneva Conventions and other international law – namely, that such facilities are not to be attacked unless they are providing significant military support which cannot feasibly be terminated other than by military attack. If a party were to breach the demilitarised zone, then it ought to be understood that the protections of the site revert to judgements of proportionality and military necessity and that the side violating the demilitarised zone ought to bear a defined – albeit proportionate – culpability for the consequences of the site’s militarisation. These rules should only apply to civilian NPPs and are clearly not relevant to military capabilities that depend on nuclear power or reactors being used to provide energy for military systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 15: Grant special protected status to critical NPP safety, security and emergency response systems.&lt;/strong&gt; If a force can isolate and therefore exert control over a civilian NPP, some reasonable expectations should be agreed on. First, no action by the controlling administration should damage or risk the functioning of systems that are critical to the safe and secure operation of NPPs, as well as to emergency response – including radiation monitoring. There should also be an agreed mechanism for the protection of declared convoys moving civilian staff certified to operate NPPs, fuel for reversionary generators and other critical spare parts to the facility. All parties should also add the demarcation of vents and water intakes and outlets for the site to no-strike lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 16: Define an obligation for the establishment of deconfliction lines by militaries operating around NPPs, as well as the nuclear regulators or other responsible authorities in the concerned states.&lt;/strong&gt; Ensuring that these measures are observed requires an ability to deconflict between the warring parties. To this end, parties should be required to establish a deconfliction line between the respective commands responsible for the area of operations containing an NPP, as well as the nuclear regulators, operators or other relevant authorities in the relevant states. In the event of a radiological accident or other safety and security incident at the site, failure to crew the deconfliction line should confer liability on a command. Obligations should also be established for a force to cooperate in protecting civilian traffic intended to assist in dealing with an identified safety incident. This deconfliction mechanism should also allow access and regular rotation of IAEA staff to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 17: Establish regulations relating to effects of cyber and electromagnetic activities applied in the vicinity of NPPs.&lt;/strong&gt; As regards military effects targeting NPPs, capabilities such as electronic warfare effects, and especially cyber attacks, could impact the functioning of an NPP. In the case of electronic warfare, the disruption of critical sensors, precision timing and other functions could lead to protocols being initiated in autonomous control systems that are highly suboptimal. In the case of cyber attacks, these could damage control systems for the NPP. The air-gapping of NPP systems is an impediment, but not an impenetrable barrier, to military cyber capabilities. It would therefore be sensible to standardise the frequencies and functioning of sensors used at NPPs. Technical specifications should be made available to governments – though not necessarily the public – and regulations constraining the use of electronic warfare effects against NPPs should be articulated. Cyber effects are different from electronic warfare effects because they are bespoke, especially against an air-gapped system. Here, it should be agreed that cyber attacks that are liable to cause the malfunction of safety systems, or enact protocols that threaten plant safety, should be considered a breach of international law when used against a civilian NPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threats to nuclear safety and security in Ukraine resulting from Russia’s invasion pose a range of acute and chronic risks. The likelihood of a Chornobyl-like catastrophe is limited unless Ukraine’s NPPs are targeted deliberately. However, the potential for a Fukushima-like radiological incident, or the spread of radioactive particles resulting from a strike on a radioactive waste storage facility, while still not highly likely, cannot be discounted. It is important that the international community works to support Ukraine in mitigating the impact of such a scenario, endeavours to deter Russia from further endangering NPPs, and is proactive in addressing the chronic challenges before they become acute. Russia’s disregard for its own commitments to the protection of nuclear facilities should also be punished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia’s actions in its disregard for nuclear safety and security and the IHL protections granted to nuclear facilities are egregious, it should also be recognised that threats to nuclear safety and security in conflict zones will arise even if combatants adhere to the LOAC and IHL. Attacks on CNI – including energy generation – are part of most states’ military doctrines and there are legitimate military objectives to be achieved in seizing control of civilian NPPs. For example, severing power supplies as part of an initial suppression and destruction of enemy air defences would be consistent with international law but could pose secondary challenges to NPPs which would be thrown into emergency shutdown. As more states turn to nuclear power to deal with the threat from climate change, it is likely that NPPs will become more prevalent in conflict zones, and that controlling them will become a key military objective. Even though gaining control of an NPP does not necessarily require assaulting the structure, fighting in the vicinity of NPPs carries considerable risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has demonstrated some significant deficiencies in the international regulation of NPPs and gaps in safety and security standards. As the challenges presented in Ukraine are likely to be repeated in the future, the international community must use the lessons from the conflict to update the design, operation and oversight of NPPs to improve their safety and security. It is also worthwhile for militaries to consider what measures they can implement to reduce the risk of accidental damage to NPPs while enabling them to conduct legitimate military tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has made a range of recommendations. Any proposals that rely on the outright prohibition of military action targeting NPPs are unlikely to be effective or to withstand the test of time. Instead, understanding why and how NPPs are likely to factor into military planning, including the types of attacks that may be directed at them, will help determine how best to prepare for their defence and potential occupation. Preparations can be made at the point of NPP design and construction in the first instance, to ensure physical resilience of key structures and support systems. Measures taken during a conflict – such as the establishment of deconfliction lines or a 1-km demilitarised zone around NPPs – can help to further reduce the likelihood of radiological accidents. Cooperation between industry, national nuclear regulators and ministries of defence, as well as leadership by the IAEA and individual countries or groups of states, will be key in further articulating the necessary measures and standards to support nuclear safety and security in future military conflicts and ensuring their effective implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（26日）踏入審訊第51天。控方昨表示上周六（22日）始破解第三名控方證人鍾錦麟的電話，辯方需時審視昨午才收到的逾2,400則訊息，押至今天處理。辯方今表示仍需時審視，望於下周才傳召鍾錦麟，法官陳慶偉押至下周四（5月4日）續審，又向控方指「不希望再有任何意外和延遲」。法官李運騰關注審訊進度，提及他於9月底有案件要處理，又指除不認罪的16名被告，亦需時處理其餘31人的求情判刑。翻查資料，黎智英及《蘋果日報》3間公司涉勾結外國勢力案定於9月底開審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方需時審視新訊息-鍾錦麟押至下周四作供-官不希望再有任何任何意外和延遲&quot;&gt;辯方需時審視新訊息 鍾錦麟押至下周四作供 官：不希望再有任何任何意外和延遲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨表示，於上周六（22日）始破解鍾錦麟電話，並於昨午向辯方提供逾2,400則訊息。控方稱不會依賴新資料，辯方則指需時審視，押後至今天處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文今表示，團隊仍在審視新的WhatsApp訊息和附件，亦需向當事人索取指示，建議鍾錦麟的主問押後至本周五開始，並望能於當天完結，可於下周四開始盤問，並指大部分辯方律師均同意。法官早前宣布，明天（27日）、下周二及周三（5月2日及3日）均不開庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 則表示，雖然他有助手能讀中文，但他不能，故其進度較慢，希望下周才傳召鍾錦麟。坐在 Beel 身旁的大律師黃廷光沒有配戴假髮，法官陳慶偉一度着 Beel：「叫你的鄰座戴上他的假髮」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉遂指，不認為有太大分別，或可於下星期開始，期間各方也可索取指示，又向控方指：「我不希望再有任何意外和延遲。（I hope there won’t be any more surprise and delay.）」，多名被告發笑。主控萬德豪表示，應不會再有類似的披露情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉表示，他此前曾代表鍾錦麟作保釋申請。法官李運騰問是在另一宗案件？馬指是這宗案件，但是在最早的保釋申請階段，而其後的發展與他無關。他又指，控方和辯方均知悉此情況，沒有人反對。陳慶偉表示明白，會再考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注審訊進度-指需處理31人求情&quot;&gt;官關注審訊進度 指需處理31人求情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後表示，由於趙家賢已完成作供，相信之後的證人需時較短，問審訊是否仍預計需時90日？萬德豪指，視乎可同意多少事實，仍與辯方商討。李運騰指越快越好，因他在9月底有很重大的案件要處理（very substantive engagement），又指考慮到法官的數量，更換法官並不可行。李又指，大律師關文渭也有參與該案，關則指主控周天行亦有參與該案。翻查資料，壹傳媒創辦人黎智英與《蘋果日報》3間公司被控「串謀勾結外國勢力」等罪，原定今年9月25日開審，李運騰為該案主審法官之一，本案主控周天行亦為該案主控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪表示，預計本周能給予答覆。李運騰再指，除了不認罪的16名被告，尚要處理其餘31名被告的判刑，假設每天可聽取兩人求情，31人也需要兩星期，還未計可能要爭拗案情撮要。萬德豪指會盡力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師黃宇逸最後表示，希望控方能提供將會傳召的證人名單，法官着他直接問控方。聆訊不足10分鐘完結。&lt;/p&gt;

It provides an overview of the priorities of five countries (the UK, the US, Canada, Japan, and Singapore) and the EU. The focus rests on cyber policy advanced in the period from January 2019 to March 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research underlying this paper focuses on four key research areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The general context in which cyber policy is made.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Priorities with regard to the protection of critical national infrastructure (CNI).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approaches to the development of cyber skills and the cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;International cooperation on norm development for cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-context&quot;&gt;The Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All jurisdictions follow a unique cyber strategy, but common approaches exist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategies are updated in line with domestic timelines but also adjust to changes in the cyber threat landscape (such as the rise of cybercrime) and respond to geopolitical events and the increased need to secure CNI and supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategies increasingly focus on harmonising and streamlining each jurisdiction’s cyber policies to avoid fragmentation and duplication of efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an increasing reliance on interventionist policies and regulations to enhance resilience and cyber-security standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-critical-national-infrastructure&quot;&gt;On Critical National Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring greater protection of critical national infrastructure (CNI) is a priority for all jurisdictions examined. This is often done by updating or increasing existing cyber-security obligations, or expanding them beyond CNI sectors to further support the resilience of supply chains. International businesses and cyber-security professionals must simultaneously comply with changing (and at times varying) obligations among different jurisdictions. Further research comparing the differing scopes of CNI designations and their respective cyber-security obligations is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-the-cyber-workforce&quot;&gt;On the Cyber Workforce&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global cyber-security workforce shortage and the need for further skills development is seen in all jurisdictions examined. A wide range of initiatives, many of which resemble each other, are advanced by the respective jurisdictions to attract talent, diversify the workforce and increasingly harmonise existing efforts. For example, several jurisdictions have adopted skills frameworks, such as the US’s National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework or the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF), to harmonise language used to describe cyber-security roles. Little is known about the effectiveness of these initiatives in markedly reducing the cyber-security workforce gap in a quantifiable way. More research is needed to understand which initiatives help reduce the gap in the cyber-security workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-international-cooperation-on-cyber-norm-development&quot;&gt;On International Cooperation on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All jurisdictions examined actively cooperate on cyber-norm development and seek to advance a free and secure cyberspace. They do so by supporting UN processes for norm development, by engaging in a range of multilateral, bilateral and multi-stakeholder arrangements, and by seeking greater cooperation on cyber (including on the development of cyber-security skills and closing the gap in the cyber workforce). More cooperation on skills development could further boost understanding of how to develop global solutions to a global problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological innovation and advancement continue to disrupt society at pace. While the economic benefits of breakthrough technologies are fairly clear, there are new cyber risks to infrastructure and data to consider. In light of these dynamics, countries are constantly designing, monitoring and refreshing their cyber -security policies, legislation and regulation to protect national security and the economic security and safety of organisations and their citizens. While some of the trends in cyber security are global, each jurisdiction’s approach to cyber policy and associated legislation and regulation follows its own themes and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the content of cyber policies naturally varies, so do the mechanisms to implement them. Jurisdictions may prefer different types of levers to implement their cyber policies. Whereas one country may prefer to legislate heavily, others may advance cyber policies through standard-setting or non-binding policies. The approach a country chooses is shaped by a multitude of complex factors, including its political standpoint, constitutional structures, the cyber-threat landscape, the role of the private sector, and other socio-legal and historical factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding national and regional approaches to cyber policy is crucial, as these directly impact individuals and organisations operating within the respective jurisdictions. This paper allows policymakers and businesses to understand regulatory trends in several jurisdictions, providing them with up-to-date insights on how the regulatory landscape in these jurisdictions is evolving – and what that means for businesses and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide sets out to compare the approaches of six different jurisdictions – the UK, the EU, the US, Canada, Japan and Singapore – with regard to their respective cyber-policy agendas. The aim here is to improve understanding of the impact these policy agendas have on businesses and individuals working in these jurisdictions. This paper provides a valuable overview of different approaches to cyber policy by identifying trends in key legislative and regulatory initiatives over the past four years. A comparative section at the end of the paper puts these initial findings into perspective and identifies areas for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research-questions&quot;&gt;Research Questions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to provide an overview of different approaches to cyber-security policy. To narrow down the wide research area of cyber-security policy, the research underlying the paper focuses on four key research questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the general background that shapes each jurisdiction’s approach to cyber policy?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the national priorities for developing cyber-resilience measures for critical national infrastructure (CNI)?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do the jurisdictions advance skills development and/or workforce regulation in the cyber context?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do these jurisdictions approach international cooperation on cyber regulation and how do they engage with other countries and entities, for example, in the context of norm-developing frameworks?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-scope&quot;&gt;Methodology and Scope&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research underlying this publication was primarily based on a review of existing literature. This involved the creation of search strings that were inputted into online repositories to identify sources. Google Scholar was the primary search engine used to find academic articles. Grey literature, including policy papers, was sourced through Bing and Google Search. From these initial sources, the research team identified further literature by examining article bibliographies and other references. Alongside these secondary sources, primary sources such as legislation, regulations and other official documents and government papers were also considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted from December 2022 to March 2023. Analysis of the gathered sourced material was based on a thematic approach, assessing sources’ provenance, arguments and conclusions in order to identify different approaches to cyber regulation in the EU and the five countries examined. The six jurisdictions studied – the UK, the EU, the US, Canada, Japan and Singapore – were chosen because they drive policymaking in cyber security and are leaders in the field, either as norm developers or because of their technology sectors. The research focused primarily on policies enacted or proposed between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this paper, the term ‘policy’ is used in a broad sense and encompasses binding (‘hard law’) as well as non-binding (‘soft law’) instruments or other policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to provide policymakers with a guide on trends in recent cyber-security policy in various jurisdictions. It is therefore limited in scope and depth and serves as a starting point for future research. This means that reference can only be made to a selection of policies, regulations, or legislative activities, rather than listing them all. Nevertheless, the paper informs the reader about key issues and trends in the field, while keeping the level of detail appropriate for an initial overview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper comprises six chapters, each dedicated to the approach to cyber-security regulation taken by one of the jurisdictions. Each chapter begins by setting out the jurisdiction’s approach to cyber policy, regulation and legislation, structured around the four research questions listed above. After setting out the general context in which the approach to cyber-security policy must be seen, each chapter goes on to identify how the jurisdiction advances cyber-resilience measures for CNI. Then, each chapter examines how the jurisdiction approaches skills development and workforce regulation, before analysing the approach to international cooperation on cyber-norm development. After the individual chapters, the paper offers some general concluding remarks that make initial comparative observations based on the jurisdiction-level analysis, and points out further areas of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uk&quot;&gt;The UK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is ‘a highly capable cyber state’ that follows an ambitious approach to cyber policy. This is reflected in its 2022 National Cyber Strategy, which advances a ‘whole of society approach’. Although largely in line with its 2016 Strategy, which shifted UK cyber policy toward binding regulation, the UK’s new strategy stresses a greater need for a holistic approach to cyber policy, as cyber issues relate to all areas of modern life. The ‘whole of society’ approach, as advanced in the UK cyber strategy, includes public–private partnerships and civil society, but also aspects such as ‘education strategy, industrial policy, work on regulations and incentives, and foreign policy’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new holistic approach also confirms the UK’s commitment to being a ‘cyber power’, a term used throughout the strategy, solidifying the UK’s strategic approach to cyberspace. It refers to the UK’s position advanced in the 2021 Integrated Review, which stresses the importance of responsible and democratic cyber power to achieving the UK’s national goals. On the whole, the UK’s strategy follows a ‘strategic and wide-ranging approach to cyber’. Next to the national cyber strategy, the UK also has a Government Cyber Security Strategy (2022–30) and a cyber-resilience strategy for the UK National Health Service (NHS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s strong position in the cyber field is supported by a wide range of public authorities working on cyber matters. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) stands out for conducting central – primarily technical – work on UK cyber security since its establishment in 2016, analysing and researching key cyber threats and risks. In 2020, the UK also confirmed the existence of its National Cyber Force, a unique body dedicated to offensive cyber operations. This agency sits between the intelligence agency GCHQ and the Ministry of Defence and ‘covers the full range of the UK’s national-security priorities’, including serious crime, terrorism and state threats. In 2023, the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology was formed, taking over tasks on cyber policy previously undertaken by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). Of primary relevance for the UK workforce is the UK Cyber Security Council, a self-regulatory body developing and promoting professional standards for the cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wide range of threats facing the UK was underlined in the NCSC’s 2022 Annual Review. These include ransomware attacks and other types of cybercrime, threats posed by state actors in cyberspace, and commercially available cyber tools. The UK also faces a significant gap in the cyber-security workforce, which increased further in 2022. The UK cyber strategy recognises this gap and signals an intention to expand the UK’s cyber skills and train, attract and diversify a growing cyber-security workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the priorities set out in the UK National Cyber Strategy is increasing the UK’s resilience. Confirming its whole-of-society approach, efforts to increase cyber resilience include (but are not limited to) improving the resilience of CNI. The UK government currently identifies 13 sectors as CNI, including civil nuclear, chemicals, food and health – education is not among the sectors listed. Given that a large percentage of UK CNI is owned by the private sector, close cooperation between the public and private sectors is required. The NCSC fosters such cooperation and provides a number of tools for guidance and advice for CNI businesses. It has also set up the ‘Industry 100’ initiative for further cooperation with industry partners. Furthermore, the 2023 Refresh of the UK’s Integrated Review announced a National Protective Security Authority, which ‘will engage with businesses and institutions to protect [the UK’s] security and prosperity at home’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the regulatory side, the UK has confirmed it will update its 2018 Security of Network &amp;amp; Information Systems Regulations (NIS Regulations). Results of the consultation process on the proposal for the updated NIS Regulations were published in November 2022, stating that the government aims to update this legislation ‘as soon as parliamentary time allows’. Given the updated EU regulations on NIS, such an update comes as no surprise, but could potentially mark one of the first areas of divergence post-Brexit. Businesses and their cyber-security staff operating in the EU and the UK which fall under the scope of both regulations will have to comply with two changing – but not necessarily identical – sets of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the UK’s priorities for the updated NIS Regulations is to broaden the scope of their application, to include more businesses that will have to comply with the respective binding obligations, technology providers in particular. The regulations’ two-tier system, which imposes stricter requirements on essential service providers than on digital service providers, will remain. However, and arguably ‘long overlooked by the UK’s NIS Regulations’, managed service providers will be added as a new category of digital service providers that must comply with the regulations’ requirements. Although software companies are unlikely to be included, the illustrative list published by DCMS names IT outsourcing services, application management services, managed security operations centres and incident response services as managed IT services that will fall within the new scope of the NIS Regulations. As a result, these entities’ cyber workforces must comply with the new cyber-security obligations in the updated NIS Regulations. Furthermore, the updated regulations aim to improve the reporting of cyber incidents to regulators, likely expanding mandatory reporting to incidents ‘even if they don’t immediately cause disruption’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond CNI – and mirroring the EU’s proposal for a Cyber Resilience Act – the UK also passed the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act in December 2022. This entails obligations for companies that manufacture, import or distribute smart consumer products, further enhancing cyber resilience in the UK; however, these obligations have not yet come into force, as they require additional regulation. Such obligations may build upon the Code of Practice for Consumer IoT Security that the DCMS and NCSC developed in 2018. In addition, the UK government is advancing a Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, seeking to update the data protection laws previously based on the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, and to reduce paperwork for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to implement the regulatory updates outlined above and to enhance cyber resilience, the UK’s National Cyber Strategy recognises a need for developing a more ‘diverse and technically skilled workforce’. Improving diversity, in this context, goes beyond targeting the gender imbalance in the field, but also includes the need for greater regional diversity. London and the southeast of England employ nearly half of all UK cyber-security professionals. In response to this imbalance, the UK government has funded 12 ‘cyber clusters’. Located throughout all four home nations, these organisations are tasked with enhancing cooperation with the (local) private sector and civil society, but also with various public stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other government-backed initiatives for skills development include CyBOK (a programme setting up a body for collecting knowledge and making resources to develop cyber skills publicly available). Further initiatives under the NCSC’s CyberFirst programme for students include ‘Cyber Explorers’, a learning platform for young students, and the CyberFirst bursary scheme, offering undergraduate students £4,000 per year in financial assistance and cyber-security training to support their careers in cyber security. The UK Cyber Security Council has further established a cyber career framework, identifying 16 areas of specialism that provide practitioners with guidelines for career planning. In addition, the UK Cyber Security Council has taken over the (formerly NCSC-run) Certified Cyber Professional Scheme. The Council has also launched a pilot professional registration scheme for some of the 16 specialisms in cyber security at three registration titles: Associate; Principal; and Chartered. This pilot scheme will be extended to more specialisms throughout 2023. Such pilot projects can be seen as indicative of future developments in the professionalisation of the UK’s cyber workforce. This is also in line with a DCMS consultation on the professionalisation of the cyber workforce, which envisages professional standard-setting by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the UK arguably still faces a significant shortage in the cyber-security workforce, and a cyber-security skills gap, despite the fact that the government has launched a wide variety of initiatives. A similar assessment is made in a DCMS study, ‘Cybersecurity Skills in the UK Labour Market 2022’, which found that many organisations lack skills in areas such as setting up configured firewalls or detecting and removing malware. Other skills-development paths such as apprenticeships or skills transfers in later career stages could be better utilised to try to close the gap even more. Further research is thus necessary to better understand the effectiveness of existing initiatives for skills development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as advancing cyber policy on a domestic level, the UK also shapes international norm development in cyberspace. A 2022 ministerial document describes the UK as a ‘leading responsible and democratic cyber power’. The UK delivers on such ambitions by being actively involved in the UN norm-development processes, arguing in favour of norms of responsible cyber behaviour and the applicability of international law in cyberspace. The UK has also repeatedly argued in favour of a multi-stakeholder approach to cyberspace governance. Furthermore, the UK government emphasises the need for a stable, peaceful and secure cyberspace that maintains human-rights standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s international cooperation on cyber-norm development is primarily advanced through the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), which funds a number of initiatives for greater norm cooperation in cyberspace; this includes, for example, funding projects identifying responsible cyber behaviour. In addition, the UK actively supports and funds cyber capacity-building in cooperation with a range of jurisdictions, particularly Commonwealth countries. In 2021, an additional £22 million for cyber capacity-building in Africa and the Indo-Pacific was announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, the UK has cooperated with its allies with respect to sanctioning cyber-criminals, as well as with attributing malicious cyber operations to state actors. Finally, the UK has concluded a large number of bilateral agreements with other jurisdictions, setting out areas of cooperation in the cyber domain, including the US, the Netherlands, Australia and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-eu&quot;&gt;The EU&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-1&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU is a well-established player in the field of cyber policy and actively shapes Europe’s approach to the regulation of cyber security. Economically powerful, the EU has also proven to be highly influential on cyber-security matters, and not just when it comes to data protection. The EU implements its vision for a free and secure cyberspace through a combination of different instruments, binding regulations, standard-setting directives and influential policies (including cyber diplomacy). Whereas the EU cyber-security policy in the 2010s was still largely seen as fragmented or ‘unsystematic’, many of the more recent efforts are working towards greater horizontal integration and harmonisation among EU member states. Four key activities have stood out in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the EU updated its cyber-security strategy in 2020 to mark the new digital decade. The updated strategy prioritises greater cyber resilience, especially for critical infrastructure, as well as increased cooperation and EU leadership on international norms and standards development. Activities in both areas are addressed in greater detail below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the role of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, has been strengthened by the 2019 Cybersecurity Act, giving the body a permanent mandate, as well as more tasks and resources. The EU Cybersecurity Act introduces an EU-wide cyber-security certification framework for ICT products, services and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the European Commission and the European External Action Service set out the EU’s new cyber defence policy in November 2022, which is ‘intended to strengthen European Cybersecurity capacity, boost military and civilian cooperation, close potential loopholes, reduce strategic dependencies and develop cyber skills’. This policy is primarily a response to deteriorating relations with Russia, and includes setting up an EU Cyber Defence Coordination Centre, as well as a network of military Computer Emergency Response Teams, an EU Cyber Commanders Conference and joint exercises. Similarly, the newly proposed Cyber Solidarity Act envisages the creation of a cyber emergency fund for incident response in the event of a large-scale cyber attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final noteworthy development is the proposal of the EU Cyber Resilience Act. The Commission’s proposal from September 2022 ‘aims to impose cybersecurity obligations on all products with digital elements whose intended and foreseeable use includes direct or indirect data connection to a device or network’. This includes cyber security by design as well as by default principles. The proposal is not yet in its final form, but is said to require businesses such as hardware manufacturers or software developers (as well as distributors and importers) to comply with ‘an “appropriate” level of cyber security, the prohibition [on selling] products with any known vulnerability, security by default configuration, protection from unauthorised access, limitation of attack surfaces, and minimisation of incident impact’. The Cyber Resilience Act is widely seen as a shift away from the EU’s sectoral approach to regulation, which imposes cyber-security regulations on specific products such as medical devices. Instead, the Cyber Resilience Act is intended to avoid both the fragmentation of market standards and duplication of obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni-1&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protection and resilience of CNI are also a growing priority for EU policymakers. In order to be prepared to respond to the landscape of heightened threats in the contemporary geopolitical context, the EU is currently seeking to update its directive on critical infrastructure (from 2008) and intends new legislation to be in force in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new legislation will be complemented by existing directives, primarily the Directive on Resilience of Critical Infrastructure and the Revised Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS 2 Directive). The former was proposed by the Commission in 2020 to strengthen the resilience of critical entities that provide essential services in case of disruption, e.g., terrorist or other attacks. Member states are required to have a strategy for such events and to ‘carry out risk assessments’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updated in 2022, the NIS 2 Directive complements the Directive on Resilience of Critical Infrastructure by obliging the same CNI entities to follow cyber-resilience obligations. It has further expanded in scope and ‘now covers medium and large entities from more sectors that are critical for the economy and society’. The updated NIS 2 Directive imposes strengthened cyber-security requirements on companies, covers the security of supply chains and further ‘introduces accountability of top management for non-compliance with the cybersecurity obligations’ alongside stricter enforcement requirements, alignment of reporting obligations and supervisory measures for national authorities. The NIS 2 Directive came into force in January 2023, giving member states until October 2024 to incorporate the measures into national law. However, there can still be national differences in implementation, and businesses and cyber-security professionals may have to comply with varying obligations, depending on the country in which they operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obligations set out under the NIS 2 Directive, the Cyber Resilience Act and the Cyber Security Act increase cyber-security obligations and expand their application to a growing number of sectors and organisations. These obligations underline the need for cyber-security expertise and further require that businesses comply with new policies; this is likely to increase demand for more cyber professionals and more cyber expertise in related fields, e.g., in procurement or project management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-1&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To implement the increased obligations for cyber resilience set out in new and updated regulations, cyber-skills development is necessary, and the cyber workforce needs to be able to comply with these new measures. The lack of cyber-security skills in the European workforce has frequently been addressed in the literature. Not only is there a significant skills gap, which some studies find to be growing, but it is also increasingly difficult for companies to find and hire skilled cyber-security staff. Studies imply that the cyber-security labour market has been unable to match the steep rise in cybercrime and the high demand for cyber-security professionals in light of increasing digitalisation. Although skills and workforce development are dealt with by each individual member state, the EU is also responding to these issues, and has funded a wide range of initiatives in this sphere, particularly in terms of harmonising existing approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the European Commission launched four projects for cyber-security research, alongside training and education programmes, but their funding is now coming to an end. They were launched in preparation for the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC), which is currently being developed. The ECCC will be located in Bucharest and will, together with national competence centres, develop ‘a common agenda for technology development’, including in businesses, especially SMEs. Furthermore, the European Commission has plans to set up a Cybersecurity Skills Academy with a potential launch date in the third quarter of 2023. This year, 2023, is also the European Year of Skills, prompting further initiatives to address the skills shortages among the EU workforce, including in cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with the EU’s other efforts to streamline its cyber-security policy, ENISA introduced the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF) in September 2022. As a ‘tool to build a common understanding of the cybersecurity professional role profiles’, the ECSF sets out 12 roles and their respective skills and responsibilities, for example, those of ‘cyber incident responder’, or ‘cybersecurity educator’. However, previous studies have indicated the need for further research on what policies are most effective in supporting a robust talent pipeline for cyber-security professionals. Alongside this Framework, ENISA has also created a Cybersecurity Higher Education Database, which lists cyber-security degrees from EEA countries and Switzerland. The database is intended as a point of reference for citizens wanting to upgrade their skills through further education and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-1&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its work on the close coordination of cyber policy within the EU, the EU is also active beyond the territory of its member states. The EU’s 2020 Cyber Strategy sets out to ensure an open and safe internet and for the EU to ‘step up its cooperation with partners around the world who share [its] values of democracy, rule of law and human rights’. The EU has done much to act upon these aims, with some even referring to it as a ‘norm superpower’. Indeed, the EU’s track record points towards the active role it has played in shaping the cyber-norm debate. On an international level, the EU has supported the UN processes on norm development, and also supports the proposal for a Programme of Action to Advance Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace as a permanent mechanism within the UN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the EU actively cooperates with other countries to strengthen their cyber security. This includes funding cyber-security measures in Eastern European countries such as Ukraine (e.g., to secure data exchanges or to protect critical infrastructure), as well as in Georgia. Together with the US, the EU plans to provide further cyber-capacity-building in Africa and the Indo-Pacific region. The EU has also funded EU CyberNet, a network of cyber-security experts and academics, to coordinate the EU’s external cyber-capacity-building projects (although this is coming to an end in 2023), as well as EU Cyber Direct, a think tank- and academia-led initiative in support of the EU’s cyber diplomacy, focusing on norm development and capacity-building programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2019, the European Council launched a sanctions regime which enables the EU to respond to (and deter) cyber attacks. This sanctions regime, which enables collective action by the EU and its member states, is part of the ‘EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’, and it has since been extended until 2025. Potential measures include asset freezing and travel restrictions. Since its first use in 2020, the sanctions regime has been used on several subsequent occasions, for example, against the hackers who targeted the German Bundestag and those behind (inter alia) WannaCry and NotPetya. However, the attribution of cyber operations remains ‘a major challenge for EU cyber sanctions’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us&quot;&gt;The US&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-2&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has a strong record of advancing cyber-security policies that support an open, stable and secure cyberspace, and the country’s large private sector makes it a particularly powerful actor in the field. In March 2023, the Biden administration published a new National Cybersecurity Strategy, which is based on five key pillars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The defence of critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disruption and dismantling of threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shaping market forces to drive security and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investing in a resilient future (including through workforce development).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forging international partnerships to pursue shared goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These key pillars will be referenced throughout this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new cyber-security strategy marks a change in the US approach to cyber policy, in so far as it aims to increase regulatory oversight and paves the way for further federal cyber-security regulation. By advancing an increasingly coordinated approach to cyber-security regulation, the strategy seeks to impose further binding obligations on the private sector, meaning that hardware and software vendors will be increasingly responsible for implementing cyber-security standards. If implemented into law, the new strategy proposes that technology companies may be liable for failing to implement these standards. This new cyber-security strategy is, however, in line with a number of recent US cyber policies, for example, the regulations on cyber security for oil and gas pipelines that were introduced after the 2021 Colonial Pipeline hack. Similarly, President Biden has increased binding obligations on businesses when introducing mandatory reporting for CNI operators experiencing a significant cyber attack (such as a ransomware attack). The new cyber-security strategy is the result of increased cooperation with the private sector, and this cooperation will remain a key component going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new cyber-security strategy also intends to streamline US policy and to coordinate regulatory efforts. Previously, the Biden administration has often relied upon presidential interventions (for example, Executive Order 14028), but Congress has also advanced additional legislation on cyber-security issues. However, Congress can challenge or subsequently legislate contrary to an Executive Order. Similarly, in terms of the new cyber strategy, one risk is that party division in Congress could limit progress on implementing the strategy’s objectives. As a result, some think that the ‘strategy won’t have any regulatory teeth itself’. The following sections take a closer look at specific aspects of US cyber-security strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI One of the main pillars of the new US cyber-security strategy relates to defending CNI. In line with the broader shift towards top-down regulatory measures set out in the cyber-security strategy, a similar shift is proposed for measures protecting CNI. In light of significant threats facing the US, Anne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, considers that previous ‘voluntary efforts have been insufficient’. The new strategy thus intends to enhance regulation by establishing new cyber-security requirements in ‘certain critical sectors’ and by requiring new authorities to set regulations in other sectors. Currently, only some of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors are subject to regulation. While five sectors (nuclear power, large energy generation, chemicals, financial services and major defence contractors) were subject to regulation prior to the Biden administration taking office, the Colonial Pipeline attack led to the regulation of further sectors, i.e., oil and gas pipelines, and aviation and railways. It is expected that the Environmental Protection Agency will also issue similar regulations for the water sector, leaving five sectors which are not subject to the oversight of an authority that has the competence to launch federal cyber regulation. Here, Congress could legislate to enhance further binding cyber-security standards for these sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protection of CNI is further advanced by the Cybersecurity &amp;amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), founded in 2018, which has recently published its first Strategic Plan (for 2023–25). It identifies four key priorities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leading ‘the national effort to ensure the defense and resilience of cyberspace’.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reducing risk to CNI, but also increasing its resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fostering whole-of-nation operational collaboration and information-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking a unified approach as ‘[one] CISA through integrated functions, capabilities, and workforce’.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much of the US’s CNI is owned by the private sector, government cooperation with industry is particularly important. Relevant initiatives include CISA’s Automated Indicator Sharing Program, an early warning system enabling information-sharing between companies and public agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further cyber-security standards and best practices are also developed and shared by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which works closely with industry stakeholders and public agencies: for example, all federal agencies must implement its cyber-security standards. Although guidelines such as those developed under Executive Order 14028 on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity (May 2021) are primarily aimed at federal agencies, they can also be implemented by the private sector. One priority featured in the recent work of NIST is the protection of supply chains. NIST is currently working on updating its Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0). Initially aimed at CNI only, this framework is now used more widely, and has been updated using private and civil sector input. A draft of the new framework is expected by summer 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updated regulations and an increase in binding cyber-security obligations across an expanding number of sectors also means that companies are reliant on cyber-security professionals to implement such obligations. The cyber workforce in these areas must have the relevant skills to fulfil such tasks, both to comply with regulations and to uphold cyber security more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-2&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obligation to comply with new cyber-security standards is linked to another key pillar of the new US cyber-security strategy – the investment in greater resilience. This pillar includes the aim of strengthening the cyber workforce and envisages the development of a National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy. Currently, the gap in the US cyber-security workforce is more than 410,000. A number of initiatives support efforts to fill this gap and improve skills development throughout the US; one noteworthy example of such efforts is the National Cyber Workforce and Education Summit that took place in July 2022, bringing together relevant stakeholders from the public and private sectors and from civil society. In this context, several further efforts were announced by multiple stakeholders, including a Cybersecurity Apprenticeship Sprint, which concluded in November 2022. The ‘sprint’ underlined a commitment to grow the adoption of apprenticeships as a pathway to employment in the US cyber-security workforce. The new cyber-security strategy also stresses the need for greater diversity, equity and inclusion in the cyber workforce. It thereby echoes previous efforts, such as a June 2021 Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce. Several initiatives aim to increase such diversity, for example an internship programme seeking increased diversity in the New York City cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further examples of initiatives supporting cyber-security awareness and skills development in the US are manifold. For example, the US Security and Exchange Commission has proposed new rules that require board members of publicly traded companies to disclose their cyber expertise. CISA has also set up awareness campaigns to increase national public awareness and enhance levels of cyber-security understanding. CISA also supports a range of online training courses and has a dedicated National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS). The CyberSkills2Work initiative (2020) enables military veterans to transition into a career in cyber security. Other initiatives – primarily aimed at the younger generations – involve a range of cyber-security games and competitions. Meanwhile, individuals keen on advancing their cyber-security skills can consult the Cybersecurity Workforce Training Guide, which, together with the Cyber Career Pathways Tool, allows individuals to set out a training planin line with their skill level. Businesses that want to identify the extent of the cyber-security workforce within a specific area, or the costs associated with hiring additional cyber-security staff, can also consult the CyberSeek initiative, which provides information and an interactive map on job postings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the gap in the cyber-security workforce persists, despite this wide range of initiatives on skills development, meaning that further research is required to better understand the effectiveness of these initiatives. Here, the newly proposed National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy is intended to coordinate the US approach to developing a stronger and more diverse cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To harmonise the terminology used to describe the tasks and skills of cyber-security professionals, the US has adopted the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. This sets out categories of common cyber-security functions, specialist areas of cyber-security work, and work roles, providing detailed descriptions of the required knowledge, skills and abilities for each role. Although initially launched in 2012, the current (fourth) version includes several updates made in 2020. The NICE Framework was initially advanced as a national initiative but has since been influential in many other jurisdictions, including Canada and Japan, underlining that workforce development is a global issue. Despite the widespread influence of the Framework, recent research indicates that US employers still find that graduates of US higher education institutions lack the NICE foundation. The NICE Framework continues to be updated, including through public consultation on updated Framework data such as knowledge and skills statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-2&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond its national policies, the US is a leader in international norm development on cyber security and the regulation of cyberspace. It strongly lobbies for a free, secure and open internet, and envisages a multi-stakeholder approach to the governance of cyberspace. This is reflected in a wide range of activities and initiatives, including the US-led (but now finished) UN Governmental Group of Experts, for which it sponsored a resolution for renewal for 2019–21, as well as multiple initiatives and exercises conducted with NATO Allies. Together with a range of like-minded countries, in 2019, the US advanced a statement on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, supporting the efforts of UN working groups. The US also became part of the Paris Call, a multi-stakeholder initiative led by France and Microsoft, in 2021, after initially being absent from the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional partnerships also allow the US to engage in ‘strategically-minded capacity building’, for example in cooperation with the African Union. Further partnerships such as the trilateral agreement AUKUS (with the UK and Australia) aim to strengthen cyber defence and resilience in the Indo-Pacific. Cyber security in the Indo-Pacific is further supported through the Quad, particularly in light of increased threats in this area stemming from China and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US also indirectly advances norms through cooperation with other countries, for example when attributing cyber operations to states together with Five Eyes partners and others, or when imposing sanctions on cyber criminals (as was done more recently with the UK). In addition, a wide range of bilateral agreements further ensure US cooperation on cyber-security issues with like-minded jurisdictions such as Canada (on the protection of the shared energy infrastructure) and the UK (for a joint cyber academy). US cooperation with the EU is particularly noteworthy: after years of negotiations, the EU and the US recently agreed on a draft update for the EU–US data privacy framework, and in 2021 they set up the EU–US Trade and Technology Council for closer cooperation on digital transformation and technologies, based on shared values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to workforce development, the new US cyber-security strategy acknowledges that workforce development is a global issue. The strategy therefore seeks to enhance cooperation with other countries and to learn from their experience to further develop a skilled and diverse cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;canada&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-3&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada centres its cyber policy around its National Cyber Security Strategy, which was published in 2018. The core goals of this strategy were secure and resilient Canadian systems; an innovative and adaptive cyber ecosystem; and effective leadership, governance and collaboration. These goals remain valid, and an action plan guides their implementation. The 2021 mid-review of the strategy found that its targets were being met, including the establishment of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, but that challenges persist ‘in meeting the growing demands for cyber talent’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cyber-threat landscape has expanded since the publication of Canada’s National Cyber Security Strategy. While Canada has highly developed cyber-security systems, it is also one of the most targeted countries, especially when it comes to cybercrime. The head of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security wrote in 2022 that ‘Cybercrime is still the number one cyber threat activity affecting Canadians [and the] state-sponsored cyber programs of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea continue to pose the greatest strategic cyber threat to Canada’. Canada’s internet usage has increased since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, thereby also expanding the threat surface, both for individuals and for organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although they were not caused by cyber attacks, Canada experienced internet outages in 2021 and 2022 that demonstrated the vitalness of stable connectivity and the highly connected nature of critical infrastructure sectors. The increased risk to critical infrastructure was confirmed by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security’s cyber-threat assessment for 2023–24. Threats include that posed by state-sponsored cyber operations; influence-seeking by cyber-threat actors that are ‘degrading trust in online spaces’; and ransomware attacks and other forms of cybercrime targeting Canadians and Canadian organisations. Canadian cyber policy focuses on adapting to this changing threat landscape and on tackling continuing issues, such as shortages of the cyber-security professionals necessary for ensuring resilience in the context of the morphing threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni-2&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other jurisdictions discussed in this paper, Canada stresses the importance of increasing the resilience of its critical infrastructure. Canada defines its critical infrastructure as comprising 10 sectors. Canadian CNI has been subject to several significant cyber incidents, in particular the healthcare sector and local government. The National Cyber Threat Assessment 2023–2024 points out that critical infrastructure depends on its supply chains, making CNI especially vulnerable as attackers might first target a supplier to infiltrate or disrupt CNI. Despite deteriorating relations with Russia and China, however, Canada’s 2023–24 Cyber Threat Assessment concludes that ‘state-sponsored cyber threat actors will very likely refrain from intentionally disrupting or destroying Canadian critical infrastructure in the absence of direct hostilities’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further secure its CNI, Canada has ‘increased bilateral collaboration with the United States on critical energy infrastructure protection’. In June 2022, Canada introduced Bill C-26, which requires designated operators (i.e., those providing vital services, including in the energy, finance, transport and telecommunications sectors) to increase their cyber-security measures and to report attacks. If the bill becomes law, such measures will be enforceable by the authorities with the help of audit powers, fines and even criminal penalties. This legislation, if passed, would have a direct impact on private companies operating in Canada. If designated as operators under Bill C-26, companies will have to establish, maintain and review a cyber-security programme within 90 days, report incidents, comply with directions and maintain records of incidents and compliance. Implementing such suggested obligations will require a skilled cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s bill has been criticised as ‘potentially impair[ing] the ability of private companies to dispute demands, orders, or regulations that are issued by the government’ and for having ‘overly broad secrecy clauses’, raising concerns over transparency and accountability. Others see the mandatory reporting and information sharing between agencies as necessary steps to combat cybercrime, which in turn benefits both organisations and individuals. The bill recently finished its second reading in the Canadian House of Commons, and has yet to go to the Senate, and so it could still be amended over the course of the legislative procedure, but it could become law in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-3&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the other jurisdictions examined in this paper, the implementation of cyber-security obligations in Canada and the achievement of good cyber-security standards more generally there – in order to increase the country’s cyber resilience – requires a skilled cyber workforce. The shortage in Canada’s cyber-security workforce remains stable but considerable. Canada actively competes for the skilled workers it needs, particularly with the US. As US entities pay relatively higher salaries, the US is an attractive place of work for Canadians. While this leads to the risk of a ‘brain drain’ in the Canadian cyber-security sector, some commentators see lower Canadian wages as an opportunity for investors in the cyber-security sector. Within Canada itself the number of job postings among the different provinces varies considerably, with Ontario serving as the main hub of cyber-security-related jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to cyber workforce qualifications, Canada provides both formal cyber-security education (through universities) and a range of complementary options via online courses, coding bootcamps and certification schemes. Furthermore, the Future Skills Centre supports a number of initiatives aimed at diversifying Canada’s cyber-security workforce, for example the Canadian Cybersecurity Skills and Talent Transformation scheme, a joint project with Rogers Cybersecure Catalyst. Canada has also adopted a Cybersecurity Skills Framework, which largely overlaps with the established US Cyber Security Workforce Framework (NICE), but which focuses on the needs of the Canadian labour market and SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in 2022 the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – in cooperation with tech companies and civil society – demanded publicly that the government further prioritise the cyber-security sector, including bolstering the cyber-security workforce ‘by investing in cybersecurity education, talent development, retention and programs that diversify and expand the cyber workforce’. TECHNATION, a not-for-profit initiative representing Canadian technology companies, lists four main challenges for workforce development in Canada, including: the need to generate and retain cyber security talent; the need for technical and non-technical roles to gain sufficient knowledge, skills and abilities; and the need to normalise cyber security within the workplace. In addition, the Canadian workforce must be ‘responsive to the changing technology landscape’. In February 2023, the Canadian government announced additional support in the form of 250 million CAD for upskilling its workforce, including in the cyber-security profession, with the help of short-cycle upskilling programmes run in partnership with Palette Skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-3&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada has been an active partner for international cyber-norm development, for example when advocating for an open, secure and multi-stakeholder-led internet, and supporting the application of existing international law and norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace. Canada is not in favour of the conclusion of a new international law treaty on the regulation of cyberspace. Instead, in 2022, Canada published its interpretation of existing international law applicable to cyberspace, and has promoted the applicability of norms of responsible state behaviour in various forums, such as the G7, the G20 and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its international cooperation on cyber policy, Canada is focused in particular on ‘help[ing] other countries expand their capacity building activities’, which has been ‘a key aspect of Canada’s cyber engagement strategy’. This commitment is demonstrated in a number of initiatives, focusing largely on Latin America, the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. For example, Canada has contributed significantly to cyber capacity-building, especially in Latin America, by allocating funds to the Anti-Crime Capacity Building Program. Similarly, Canada works with the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism to improve participation in UN processes on cybercrime and cyber-security negotiations. Within the Organisation of American States, Canada also funded a project (as of 2022) to support other member states in targeting and understanding the implications of the gender gap in the cyber-security workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cooperation with other allies, especially the Five Eyes community, Canada has repeatedly attributed malicious cyber activities to other states. It has also funded projects related to how attribution can be made. Attribution is critical, as it helps to hold malicious actors accountable, and is in line with Canada’s increasingly active role in this and other related areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japan&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-4&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Japan, the award of the 2020 Olympic Games prompted a significant increase in cyber-security awareness. Aiming to protect the 2020 Olympic Summer Games from cyber attacks, the Japanese government launched widespread campaigns to build up cyber resilience (including in the private sector) and to educate the workforce. The Olympics thus arguably served as a springboard for further raising cyber-security standards in the Japanese private sector. This aim was also reflected in the country’s 2018 Cyber Security Strategy (for 2018–21), which focused primarily on the Olympic and Paralympic Games, recognising ‘the potential cyber threat from hostile states’, and referring on its first page to the growing danger of ‘organised, sophisticated, and possibly state-sponsored’ cyber attacks. Japan’s cyber-security strategy thus focuses on protecting critical infrastructure, on stakeholder cooperation, and on the improvement of cyber security in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these approaches were widely considered to have been successful in protecting the (Covid-19-delayed) Olympic Games, the priorities outlined above remain highly relevant in 2023. However, Japan’s approach to cyber security changed significantly in 2022, in light of an increasing number of cyber attacks against the country, and in particular given the deteriorating relationships with China and Russia. While still in the process of determining a cyber-security budget for 2024, Japan announced a significant change in its cyber strategy, including the adoption of an active cyber defence. Japan had previously alluded to deterrence capabilities in its 2018 strategy, but the recent shift is significant. Some even consider it to be a ‘turning point’ for Japan’s defence policy, which is traditionally limited by Japan’s pacifist constitution (as well as by privacy considerations). This recent shift constitutes an atypical, proactive approach, which is considered necessary to ‘actively pre-empt and stop attacks before they reach Japan’s systems’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Japan primarily pursues a top-down approach when advancing cyber-security measures domestically, relying predominantly on ‘government regulators to establish cyber-security requirements’. Japanese cyber-security policy includes key areas such as the protection of national infrastructure and the development of the cyber workforce, which will be addressed in more detail in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni-3&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the key issues in Japanese cyber policy are the protection of critical infrastructure and improving the resilience of supply chains, as well as wider cyber-security awareness, particularly in the private sector. While ‘Japan remains a world leader in cyberspace technologies’, its own cyber-security standards have raised concerns in the past, for example in the US, which has criticised Japan’s weak cyber-security practices and has considered these to be a barrier to deeper cooperation and intelligence sharing. Yet the US and Japan have been working to overcome these differences through bilateral talks, including signing a Memorandum of Cooperation on Cybersecurity in January 2023 to strengthen the collaboration between the two countries in the area of cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s CNI is primarily owned by the private sector. The Basic Cyber Security Act entails duties for operators of critical infrastructure businesses, a group that has expanded in recent years, and which now includes 14 sectors. However, these obligations are often vague, for example when requiring that CNI providers ‘deepen [their] interest in and understanding of the importance of cybersecurity’, and information-sharing on cyber incidents remains limited, for cultural and structural reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an updated action plan from June 2022, the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) offers guidance for safety standards and information-sharing systems to further improve cyber-security standards in Japan. The plan, which is only available in Japanese, further recommends that businesses develop risk-management procedures, and sets out specific requirements to be met by CNI businesses and staff, including Chief Information Security Officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Japan passed an economic security bill in May 2022 that provides greater protection for supply chains and infrastructure with regard to cyber attacks. More specifically, it imposes obligations on companies in critical infrastructure sectors to inform the government of software updates and to ‘vet some equipment procurement’. The private sector requires a skilled workforce to implement these obligations and to raise cyber-security awareness and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these measures, Japan continues to strengthen its strategic partnership with the US on cyber cooperation to ensure greater resilience, particularly if confronted with hostile actions by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-4&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other jurisdictions dealt with in this paper, Japan is experiencing shortages in the cyber-security workforce, and overall cyber-security awareness is arguably relatively low in Japan. This situation is augmented as many Japanese companies outsource their IT and cyber-security work, resulting in smaller in-house teams compared with other countries. Furthermore, Japanese work culture traditionally foresees a high rate of job rotation, which comes at the cost of acquiring specialised cyber-security skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respond to these skill shortages, the Japanese government has supported cyber-security skills development, for example by inaugurating the National Cyber Training Center (NICT), which offers training courses, especially for under-25s, and the Industrial Cyber Security Center of Excellence for training for mid-career and senior professionals. The NICT established a training programme, Cyber Colosseo, in advance of the Olympic Games, and also holds CYDER defence exercises, particularly for government officials and CNI businesses. However, information in English remains limited. To establish a common language for cyber-security skills, Japan has previously adopted the US NICE workforce framework, a choice made attractive by the fact that many Japanese companies outsource their IT outside Japan, and require an international understanding of what cyber-security talents are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals qualified in this area are thus in high demand in Japan and have good job opportunities. One IT recruitment agency reports that qualifications such as (ISC)²’s Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) are considered useful; that there is an increased demand for cloud engineers, such as Amazon Web Services engineers; and that demand is particularly high for personnel related to public cloud services such as SaaS and IaaS. The Japanese Ministry of Defense is also increasing its role as an employer of cyber-security workers, and has plans to increase cyber-defence personnel, aiming to expand today’s 800 staff members to 5,000 by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An initiative involving academia, government and the private sector founded the Cross-Sector Forum (2015) ‘to build an ecosystem to educate, recruit, retain, and train cybersecurity talent’ in Japan. The Forum has been active in advancing definitions of relevant talents and skills, and has created guidelines and provided funding for universities for cyber-security courses on which staff members of consortium partners can teach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-4&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside these domestic policy considerations focused on increasing resilience and workforce development, Japan undertakes cyber-security diplomacy based on three main principles: the promotion of the rule of law; cooperation on capacity building; and the development of confidence-building measures. Japan has also contributed to discussions on norm development in cyberspace, for example by participating in several rounds of UN expert group discussions on cyber norms; and, in 2021, it made a public statement on its interpretation of international law in cyberspace in the UN forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to norm development, Japan has stressed a preference for voluntary and non-binding norms on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace (as identified by the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) report in 2015), and has voiced caution, both about extending these norms and about what it sees as the risk of prematurely debating a binding new treaty. Japan is a member of the Budapest Convention against Cybercrime and, as of 2022, had joined NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. The country is also a regular participant in the ASEAN Regional Forum’s efforts on cyber issues and participates in the G7 Cyber Expert Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan also supports a number of capacity-building initiatives. These are coordinated by the NISC and focus primarily on ASEAN states. They include the annual ASEAN–Japan Cybersecurity Policy meeting and related working groups and activities. Since 2018, Japan has funded the ASEAN–Japan Cybersecurity Capacity Building Centre, which supports talent development for the region’s cyber-security workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has a range of bilateral agreements to strengthen technology and cyber cooperation with other countries, for example with the US and the UK. With respect to the latter, both nations are currently seeking to ‘make it easier for businesses to operate in both countries by aligning approaches to digital regulation’; to improve cyber resilience; and to ‘promote initiatives to standardise the security of internet-connected products and apps’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;singapore&quot;&gt;Singapore&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-5&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore is a highly digitalised city state with advanced cyber-security regulation and policies. But as ‘the cyber ecosystem in Singapore is expanding rapidly’, Singapore has also experienced a high number of cyber attacks in recent years, for example in the form of ‘SMS-phishing scams targeting bank customers’. One study finds that 65% of organisations in Singapore were hit by ransomware attacks in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respond to the changing threat landscape and boost cyber resilience, Singapore updated its cyber-security strategy in 2021. This now rests on three strategic pillars: building resilient infrastructure; enabling a safer cyberspace; and enhancing international cyber cooperation. In addition, the strategy identifies two foundational enablers: developing a vibrant cyber-security ecosystem; and growing a robust talent pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these priorities in mind, Singapore’s strategy is that of a nation that ‘has long set its sights on becoming a world-class, tech-driven city-state’ and which, as a consequence, considers cyber security to be a matter of national security. As regulation remains critical to supporting cyber resilience, Singapore’s government ‘explore[s] expanding the government’s regulatory remit’ under the updated cyber-security act, for example, to further expand regulation beyond CNI businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Singapore has launched multiple initiatives and projects in coordination with other countries and the private sector that seek to enhance cyber resilience and to educate and cultivate a much-needed IT workforce. One way the government seeks private sector engagement is through the Cybersecurity Industry Call for Innovation 2022, in which the government invites cyber-security businesses to join the effort to identify and develop ‘innovative solutions to address specific cybersecurity challenges’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-for-national-cyber-resilience-measures-for-cni-4&quot;&gt;Priorities for National Cyber-Resilience Measures for CNI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As outlined in its cyber-security strategy, building a resilient infrastructure is a key pillar of Singapore’s cyber policy. To further enhance cyber-resilience measures for Critical Information Structure (CII), that is, any ‘computer or computer system located wholly or partly in Singapore’ that is ‘necessary for the continuous delivery of an essential service’, Singapore’s Cyber Security Agency (CSA) has launched a supply chain programme. This comes in the context of the increasingly complex threat landscape, but also in response to advanced digitalisation in the post-pandemic environment. The programme sets out five initiatives, including a toolkit, a handbook, a certification scheme and a learning hub, designed to support businesses in the sector, as well as a platform for international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A complementary code of practice (CCoP 2.0) sets out measures and standards that businesses in the respective CII sectors must implement. The second edition of these standards of performance came into force in July 2022 and ‘specifies the minimum requirements’ that businesses in these sectors must adhere to. Companies can, however, request waivers of requirements for valid reasons. The CCoP further provides, among other things, incident response plans, and sets out design principles for cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These increased cyber-security obligations have to be implemented by businesses and the cyber workforce. However, this can prove challenging, for example with respect to the CII supply chain guide, which some have perceived as offering limited concrete points for companies to implement, for instance in case of a supply chain attack or to prevent supply chain risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-and-skills-development-and-regulation-5&quot;&gt;Workforce and Skills Development and Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to other jurisdictions examined in this paper, Singapore’s shortage in the cyber-security workforce lessened significantly in 2022. As it is Singapore’s ambition to be a world leader in all things cyber, the government of Singapore has introduced a broad set of measures to attract highly skilled workers, including those in the IT sector. Alongside five-year visas and visa programmes such as the TechPass, Singapore has an advanced digital infrastructure, ensuring that it is an attractive place to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even where favourable conditions and the right regulations are in place, ‘digital transformation will remain but a vision without the right talent to execute it’, according to Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How. To secure such talent, further initiatives like the TechSkills Accelerator create links between students from education institutions such as the Singapore Institute of Technology and private sector companies, for example in the form of internship programmes. At the same time, there have been calls for companies to engage in more skills-based assessments, rather than relying on formal academic qualifications during hiring processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with Singapore’s preference for regulation of the cyber-security sector, businesses providing cyber-security services and operating in Singapore are also subject to several regulatory frameworks. For example, where businesses offer penetration testing or managed security operations centre monitoring services, as of 2022, they are required to obtain a licence. Such measures, which could still be extended to other cyber-security services, are intended to protect consumer interests as well as to ‘improve service providers’ standards and standing over time’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore’s CSA has also initiated a certification scheme that recognises businesses that have ‘adopted and implemented good cybersecurity practices’. More concretely, SMEs can achieve the CSA’s ‘Cyber Essentials’ standard, which recognises good cyber-hygiene practices. For larger and international corporations, the CSA launched the ‘Cyber Trust’ mark, which recognises ‘comprehensive measures and practices’. The CSA’s CEO, David Koh, sees the certification system as a means for companies to demonstrate their commitment ‘to ensure that they remain cyber-secure, giving them an edge over their competitors’ while simultaneously ‘providing greater assurance to their customers’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-interaction-on-cyber-norm-development-5&quot;&gt;International Interaction on Cyber-Norm Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the strategic pillars of Singapore’s 2021 cyber-security strategy aims to enhance international cyber cooperation to ‘foster an open, secure, stable, accessible, peaceful, and interoperable cyberspace’. Singapore is already proactively engaging in a wide range of initiatives fostering international cooperation on cyber matters. For example, Singapore has been an active participant in UN norm processes, including the UN’s GGE and the Open-Ended Working Group, where Singapore has called for a ‘UN cyber fellowship program for small states that would support the training in cyber issues for mid- to senior level officials from smaller developing countries’. Furthermore, Singapore co-chairs, with Estonia, the UN Group on e-governance and cybersecurity, and chairs the UN Group of Friends on Digital Technologies, in cooperation with Finland and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore hosts the annual Singapore International Cyber Week, a high-level event on cyber security fostering cooperation in the field, including on norm implementation. Singapore has also been active in regional capacity building, for example when it announced in 2019 that it would provide around $22 million for the establishment of the ASEAN–Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence which, among other things, trains computer emergency response teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further support these ambitions, Singapore has multiple bilateral agreements with countries such as Australia, Japan, France, Germany, the UK and the US, all working on improving cyber capabilities in Southeast Asia. In late 2022, the Inaugural US–Singapore Cyber Dialogue was held, providing a platform of exchange for officials to discuss both further cooperation and topics such as supply-chain security, cyber capacity building, and cyber talent and workforce development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;Concluding Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following concluding remarks set out initial comparative observations based on the research underlying this paper, and point to areas that require further research to better understand the various regulatory approaches to cyber-security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the jurisdictions discussed in this paper have advanced a cyber strategy. While these strategies certainly take into account the cyber threat landscape and wider global contexts, aspects of the strategies remain specific to each jurisdiction (such as the Olympic Games in Japan). However, some common themes can be observed across the strategies:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Strategies are regularly updated in line with domestic timelines, but they also respond to international events. In the timeframe examined for this paper, recent trends include the rise of cybercrime, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, heightened tensions between China and Taiwan, and the increased need to secure CNI and supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These strategy updates increasingly focus on harmonising and streamlining each jurisdiction’s existing and developing cyber policies. Such harmonisation is advanced to avoid both fragmentation and the duplication of effort. This is reflected in the UK’s 2022 strategy and its ‘whole of society’ approach, and in the EU’s efforts to move away from a sectoral approach towards a more cohesive cyber policy, including the development of a skilled cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is a noticeable trend towards interventionist policies that emphasise regulatory approaches to cyber security, rather than voluntary standards. This trend was already apparent in the UK’s 2016 cyber strategy, and is now also reflected in the US’s 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy. In line with this trend, businesses and cyber-security professionals must anticipate regulatory changes if they are to keep up with varying and increasingly binding obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greater protection of CNI is a priority for all the jurisdictions discussed in this paper. Although the number and scope of sectors categorised as CNI varies from one jurisdiction to another, many of the designated sectors are common. Further efforts to advance mandatory cyber-security measures beyond CNI sectors is also a priority for many jurisdictions, which again has a direct impact on businesses and the cyber-security professionals who have to implement them. Thus businesses and cyber-security professionals have to simultaneously comply with changing and at times varying obligations among different jurisdictions – particularly if they operate internationally. Further research comparing and contrasting the varying scope of CNI designations and the respective cyber-security obligations for businesses and cyber-security professionals could help clarify ways for them to navigate the different requirements, and identify the skills required from the workforce where businesses operate across a range of jurisdictions. Further research could also explore opportunities and approaches for harmonising the range of frameworks, policies, initiatives and changing regulations that currently exist.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although often a whole range of tools, frameworks and initiatives improving public–private partnerships are available to guide businesses in implementing these measures, it is not always clear what these obligations entail in detail. This is especially true for non-binding or vague standards. Although much information is available in English, where this is not the case it is especially challenging for external businesses and cyber-security professionals to understand how to comply with these obligations. Again, further comparative research would help businesses and cyber-security professionals understand the practical impact of changing regulations, new cyber-security measures and – especially – the varying obligations they must comply with, such as reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common theme seen across all the jurisdictions examined is the shortage of personnel in the cyber-security workforce, exacerbated by global events and trends, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and increased digitalisation. In fact, many of the jurisdictions outlined here compete directly with each other for skilled workers (for example, the US and Canada) or rely heavily on outside cyber expertise (as is the case for Japan). Governments have responded to such shortages by acknowledging the need to improve skills development through a range of initiatives. Many of the measures in place across the different jurisdictions resemble one another, especially where they focus on attracting young people to cyber-security professions, or involve adopting skills frameworks such as NICE or the ECSF to harmonise the language used to describe cyber-security roles. Some jurisdictions prioritise specific aspects in their efforts to support a robust talent pipeline, for example when aiming for greater diversity with respect to gender (Canada, the US) and region (the UK). However, despite the multitude of initiatives fostering skills development, little is known about their effectiveness. More research is needed to understand which initiatives help eliminate discrepancies between education and the demands of industry and, as a result, reduce the gaps in the cyber-security workforce. Singapore would make an interesting case study, providing further insights into the effectiveness of measures taken in 2022, when the city state was successful in reducing its gap in the cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, the jurisdictions studied in this paper share a cooperative, proactive attitude to the development of norms applicable to cyberspace, and seek to advance a free and secure internet. All entities covered are active supporters of the UN processes for norm development in cyberspace and engage in a range of multilateral, bilateral and multi-stakeholder arrangements, seeking greater cooperation on cyber issues with other states, regional organisations, and the private sector. Areas for cooperation include norm development and capacity building, but also the development of cyber-security skills and closing the gap in the cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成一方指「抗爭派」不代表反建制反政府 僅指更積極主動 趙家賢不同意&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;趙家賢作供完畢 將傳召鍾錦麟 控方指上周六始破解其電話 官指不理想&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qgyvLtN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（25日）踏入審訊第50天，趙家賢繼續接受盤問。鄒家成一方指「本土抗爭派」中的「抗爭」不代表反建制或反政府，只是會更願意更積極主動地爭取政治目標，趙不同意，指傳統民主派亦有很多人很進取「chur 住」政府官員，屬很溫和的方法。他亦確認不清楚新界東有否就運用否決權達成共識，惟指戴耀廷原本打算參選人報名時就協議有「實體簽名」，若非有共識不可能召開初選記者會，否則公開後有人不同意會有「反彈」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙盤問下亦同意，參選超級區議會的李予信是「溫和、務實、新晉」的傳統民主派，亦同意超區界別是2012年政府與民主黨政治妥協的產物。趙指「妥協係政治嘅藝術」，他當年任民主黨中央委員時，亦支持黨友投票通過政府的政改方案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指新東第二次會議無進行過投票-趙不同意&quot;&gt;辯方指新東第二次會議無進行過投票 趙不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢繼續接受代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑盤問，根攄黎敬輝就5月5日第二次新東會議的筆記，寫有「『會運用』 - 投票通過」。趙同意當時嘗試向黎敬輝了解情況，指相信民主黨代表李永成無獲授權表態，而黎則引戴耀廷指「份協議要去出最後版本」，望以表決形式「畀一個主流嘅大方向出嚟」。趙其後再找戴，指民主黨代表應不獲授權投票，對結果感詫異，戴則回應會採用大方向起草最終協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問，戴是否沒告訴他曾舉行投票並通過決議？趙重申是非正式的意向性投票，戴是望以此拿到「大方向」。李運騰追問，不論正式或非正式，戴有否確認曾進行投票？趙稱「係有一個投票」。陳世傑最終指出，事實上第二次會議沒有進行投票，亦沒有進行意向性投票，趙不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意不清楚就運用否決權有否達成共識-指戴耀廷清楚民主黨有保留&quot;&gt;趙同意不清楚就運用否決權有否達成共識 指戴耀廷清楚民主黨有保留&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙同意，戴耀廷原本打算要求參選人簽署協議，但在6月9日記者會稱毋須簽署，而戴在他要求下，於6月8日在組織者群組發出各區協議的最後版本，他並稱之為各區共識。趙同意不知道協議如何產生，「戴耀廷冇特別同我講」，而他稱之為「共識」是因為戴這樣告訴他。他亦同意新東第二次會議至6月8日之間，不曾有其他新東會議，被問是否知道就運用否決權的條款有達成共識，趙答「我唔清楚」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續指，事實上會上就否決權有不同意見，但戴耀廷則自行（took upon）決定同意了的內容，並引趙早前曾同意法官陳慶偉指，民主陣營光譜很闊，如在否決財政預算案上社民連和本土抗爭派意見不同，最終部分選區同意使用「會運用」否決權，即使有參與者未必完全同意，但戴還是做了決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續引黎敬輝筆記，指戴會上曾提及「會議共識是較多數人的認同，接納可接受的方案」，指與趙說法相符。趙同意，並指辯方遺漏了他會後曾向戴提出民主黨有關注和顧慮，而戴稱會與民主黨或對否決預算案有顧慮的人作處理，又重申戴會駕車周圍與不同參選人溝通接觸。陳仲衡問，故戴耀廷清楚知道民主黨有保留？趙同意，指「我同佢嘅溝通當中，佢係清楚知道，所以佢同我承諾話佢會跟進」，而他亦接受了戴的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指若非有共識戴不可能召記者會-否則會有反彈&quot;&gt;趙指若非有共識戴不可能召記者會 否則會有反彈&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，辯方是向趙指出，事實上沒有大家同意的協議，而是由戴耀廷決定協議內容。趙回應就當時情況而言，若戴並非確認到參與的持分者是同意，又或是在該氣氛下受壓力同意，惟陳慶偉打斷問是指哪個時間點，問是否指6月9日記者會。趙同意並語氣急促指，若戴「唔係喺5月5日至6月9日中間確認好有共識係處理好嘅話，佢唔可能係同意然後叫我去準備個記者會去講出嚟，因為公開咗嘅話，如果有人唔同意就會即刻反彈㗎嘛」，並指原本的構思，是想每個參與者報名時都有「實體簽名」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即趙是指根據原本計劃，候選人需簽署協議，故若事實上沒有共識，而戴又自行決定，便會引起候選人的爭論？趙同意。陳世傑續指，在5個地方選區中，只有兩個區作出回應並簽署文件，陳慶偉補充即附上共同綱領。趙略為激動以雙手比劃，並大聲說：「抱歉我答唔到，個事實情況唔係咁樣，即係你將幾樣嘢痴埋一齊嚟講嘅」，鄒家成發笑。李運騰指問題很簡單，即是否只有兩區參選人報名時附上共同綱領，趙冷靜下來表示同意，指該份共同綱領「係佢哋各自區自己攞咗戴耀廷份嘢嘅一啲元素擺落去整出嚟嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續展示組織者群組 WhatsApp 紀錄，趙家賢6月19日曾稱「區軒同埋 Benny 係有白紙黑字 circulate 畀大家確認，雖然冇最後簽紙，但係呢個都係一個 mutually agreed consents（互相同意的協議）」，趙在李詢問下，指「我當時係真誠地確信」有互相同意的協議，並重申是指戴在6月8日發出的協議最後版本。李再問趙是否相信戴有將協議傳給所有人？趙指因戴曾說過會傳閱通知予有關參選人，他亦有看到戴使用廣播功能，加上他曾問一兩個參與協調者，他們均反映有透過廣播收到該文件，故當時真誠確信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙不同意抗爭一詞只是代表更積極主動傳統民主派好多人都-chur-住政府官員&quot;&gt;趙不同意「抗爭」一詞只是代表更積極主動：傳統民主派好多人都 chur 住政府官員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑其後問到「本土抗爭派」的意思，問趙是否同意「本土抗爭派」是形容較年輕、並以港人利益為先的本土政治人物，趙表示「部分同意，因為呢個只係最基本嘅一啲元素」，在延伸庭的黃之鋒發笑。陳再指，當中「抗爭」一詞不是代表他們反建制或反政府，只是他們更願意更積極主動地（proactively）爭取政治目標，趙不同意，並指「傳統民主派裡面都有好多人就住政策嗰方面，係好進取去 chur 住啲政府官員要起啲地區建設等等，你頭先講嘅係一個好溫和嘅方法之一」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，「本土抗爭派」包含不同人士，有些可能很反政府，有些則不是，因此很難給予整體答案，或者辯方可指出他們「不一定（not necessarily）」是這樣。法官陳慶偉則認為，如辯方希望，可直接向證人指出鄒家成很溫和，又或他是激進但不反政府。陳世傑一度指，鄒家成可能很主動發聲，但不一定是非法，但陳慶偉指兩者沒有關係，李運騰亦強調本案不是取決於被告屬於什麼陣營，陳世傑續指已完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指超區是政府與民主黨妥協產物-趙妥協係政治嘅藝術&quot;&gt;辯方指「超區」是政府與民主黨妥協產物 趙：妥協係政治嘅藝術&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林沒有盤問，代表李予信的大律師關文渭接着盤問。李予信參選區議會（第二）功能界別（超級區議會），關問「超區」的界別是否2012年時，政府與民主黨政治妥協（compromise）的產物，法官陳仲衡一度質疑他在問證人的意見，但關稱趙當時有份參與，陳慶偉批准發問。趙續回答：「係，妥協係政治嘅藝術」，並指自己當時是民主黨的中央委員，「喺2010年嘅政改方案，我都支持民主黨嘅立法會議員投票通過當時政府嘅政改方案」，他亦同意因此導致超區出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指超區選民為草根階層-法官我是草根階層嗎&quot;&gt;辯方指超區選民為草根階層 法官：我是草根階層嗎？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關續指，有兩個條件可成為此界別的選民，首先他並非其他功能界別選民，第二是他沒有取消登記超區的界別，趙同意。陳慶偉問即選民若沒有取消登記，會自動成為超區的選民？關同意，李運騰並一度指法官並非任何功能組別的選民，但不記得曾被要求取消登記，關指李可能忘記了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後法官與辯方就選民資格討論，關表示超區與其他功能組別有別，並非代表商界等利益，而超區選民主要是「草根階層（grassroot citizens）」，這時李運騰表示：「我也是區議會（第二）的選民，我是草根階層嗎？（“I am also voter of DC2, did I consdier myself as grassroot?”）」，陳慶偉亦指他曾經是衞生服務界的選民，多人發笑。關其後問，這些一般市民並非由其他特定界別代表？趙表示：「呢方面我比較熟悉，或者我講解清楚」，但陳慶偉即擺手打斷稱：「我們已經明白」，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙同意李予信是溫和務實新晉的傳統民主派&quot;&gt;趙同意李予信是「溫和、務實、新晉」的傳統民主派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙其後確認，於2020年與李予信為東區區議會的同事，當時趙為副主席，李則是成員，當時政府會就建設項目提出臨時撥款。關續問，李予信是否經常會對撥款投贊成票，並舉例指北角糖水道需150萬進行拆除天橋的工程，而該筆撥款需區議會通過。趙未回答，陳慶偉便指區議會只是諮詢機構（consultative body），不認為政府須獲區議會允許（permission），提醒辯方注意用詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sp7IUG6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李予信&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關改問，政府在地區建設前，要尋求區議會同意？趙同意並指：「因為好多地區部門都好重視區議會意見，唔單止工作、交通、一啲規劃，全部係透過地區部門、透過區議會去攞意見，有啲做法當然希望區議會能夠通過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，關問到趙有否私下跟李就2015年政府政改失敗等議題討論，趙稱應該有。被問到會否視李為溫和、務實的新晉民主派，趙表示李是「溫和、務實、新晉嘅傳統民主派」。李聞言微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭表示完成盤問。由於昨日趙家賢就鄭達鴻及彭卓棋早前的盤問作補充，代表鄭的大律師黃宇逸表示可能會再有盤問，陳慶偉今指，法庭考慮後決定批准黃及代表彭的大律師盧敏儀發問，但兩人最後表示沒有問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PlrAqD8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（25日）踏入審訊第50天。前民主動力召集人趙家賢接受主問及盤問共17天，今作供完畢，料下一名控方證人為同案認罪被告、民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟。控方午休前表示，上周六（22日）始破解鍾錦麟電話，需時處理披露資料事宜。法官李運騰指情況非常不理想，指電話一直由警方保管，為何審訊第50天仍要處理此基本程序，又問控方是否未獲鍾合作。控方下午解釋，由於鍾不肯定電話密碼，警方為免資料被刪而沒有冒險嘗試，並因科技進步於上周六始成功破解。控方不會依賴當中逾2,400則訊息，辯方則需時審視，案件押後至明天繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指上周六始破解鍾錦麟電話需時考慮披露資料-法官指非常不理想&quot;&gt;控方指上周六始破解鍾錦麟電話、需時考慮披露資料 法官指非常不理想&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;所有被告今早完成盤問趙家賢，並由主控萬德豪進行覆問。萬覆問完成後指預計會傳召另一認罪被告鍾錦麟，惟有事情需於午飯時處理。在趙離開後，萬解釋警方於上周六破解了鍾的電話，並考慮披露當中某些資料。李運騰問因此控方需在傳證人前考慮披露的問題？萬同意，並要檢視控方會否依賴當中的材料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰嘆氣，問電話一直是由警方抑或鍾錦麟保管？萬答是由警方保管。李指情況非常不理想，指現時已是審訊第50天，為何控方此前沒有檢視，又指控方在開審前檢視手提電話是很基本，問能否於今天之內處理好。萬指很有可能，並指可解釋為什麼要檢視該些材料，李運騰打斷指，「我認為你欠所有人一個解釋。（“I think you owe everybody an explanation of this.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱科技進步才能破解-官質疑是否未獲證人合作&quot;&gt;控方稱「科技進步」才能破解 官質疑是否未獲證人合作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續指，因為科技的進步（advancement of technology），他們現時能破解鍾的電話。李問，所以控方此前未能解鎖鍾的電話，即控方未能獲得鍾錦麟的合作？並指若鍾不願提供密碼，辯方或會關注為何控方未能得到鍾的全盤合作。萬德豪指會於午飯後回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/c4EGgIb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鍾錦麟（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就案件的進度，李運騰指鍾錦麟所需時間應沒有首兩名證人般長，並問第四名證人是誰。萬德豪指還會有專家證人及與證物鏈相關的證人，亦會為證人申請匿名令，大律師關文渭指辯方沒有反對控方申匿名令，只是提出細微的修改。代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文亦問及傳召次序，指除鍾外尚有一名匿名證人及市民證人，萬同指會於午飯後回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指鍾錦麟不肯定電話密碼-為免資料被刪故無冒險嘗試&quot;&gt;控方指鍾錦麟不肯定電話密碼 為免資料被刪故無冒險嘗試&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪午休後解釋，鍾錦麟接受警方會面時表示不肯定他電話的密碼，雖然他提供了一些密碼組合，但若輸入錯誤便可能令電話資料全數刪除，故警方沒有冒險嘗試，但上周六（22日）終成功破解，林卓廷聞言笑着重複「last saturday」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬並指，已於午休時向辯方披露相關電子材料，並附有搜查令，理解當中包括200多則新訊息，而控方不會依賴任何新材料。李運騰指，相信辯方亦需時在證人作供前審視新材料，此做法較公平。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指收到逾2千whatsapp訊息-需時檢視申押周五續審&quot;&gt;辯方指收到逾2千WhatsApp訊息 需時檢視申押周五續審&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師沈士文其後稱，於午休時收到逾2,400則 WhatsApp 訊息，亦有很多附件，辯方需時審視，望押至周五續審。萬德豪回應，新披露訊息中有九成已被趙家賢的手機資料涵蓋，因來自同一群組。李運騰指，辯方需小心比較才能決定，他們檢視資料後，有可能要重新傳召區諾軒和趙家賢，故容讓辯方有足夠時間考慮很重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉終決定，將案件押至明早續審，若辯方需更多時間可再提出。代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑指，新資料是電子版本，未能給予還柙中的當事人，或需更多時間，陳慶偉同樣着明天再處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;盤問曾稱只出席首次會議-趙覆問下確認曾兩次出席港島會議&quot;&gt;盤問曾稱只出席首次會議 趙覆問下確認曾兩次出席港島會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方上午完成對趙家賢的盤問，並由主控萬德豪進行覆問。就出席的港島區協調會議次數，趙於主問曾稱出席了首兩次，惟接受盤問時稱只曾出席首次。萬德豪指，事發於近3年前，亦不是記憶測試，展示 WhatsApp 訊息向趙澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙確認，在3月26日首次港島會議當晚近8時，曾向黎敬輝指「Ok, coming」，又着黎為他記錄重點，確認他有出席首次會議。李運騰一度問，晚上約10時趙曾發出4個表情符號，包括揮手圖案，問是什麼意思，趙邊揮手邊說：「即係喂喂喂喂我叫緊你咁解」，解釋當晚開會後與黎敬輝於附近用膳，黎一度走開，他遂問他在哪裡，同意當時會議已結束。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於4月17日第二次會議，趙確認黎當晚向他發訊息問港島區是否照開會，而翌日趙要求戴耀廷將與會者的名單發送給他，因他不認得部份人。萬問趙是否記得自己有否出席第二次會議，趙確認有，指「去咗可能睇到有啲人樣，唔係好認知邊個」，故叫戴將名單傳給他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙更正傳統民主派對否決財案僅表關注顧慮非反對指司馬文反對後無參與初選&quot;&gt;趙更正傳統民主派對否決財案僅表「關注顧慮」非反對、指司馬文反對後無參與初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，早前趙稱曾於會後與楊雪盈通電話，楊稱戴耀廷有很多想法並「由佢講」，認為參選人當選後可有自主權。萬問這通電話是何時發生，趙表示起碼是開了一次協調會議之後才聯絡，因楊當時是18區會議民主派的輪任召集人，而民動當時同意提供秘書處服務，因此與楊有很多溝通。萬追問通話是否在第一次會議後、第二次會議前發生，趙表示「抱歉主控，我淨係記得起碼肯定係第一次會議之後」，指他們傾談上述工作時，有談及戴耀廷的倡議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬另問到，趙早前在2021年7月21日進行的第二次警誡錄影會面中，表示傳統民主派「反對否決財政預算案」，趙當時稱「反對」一詞應改為表達「關注和顧慮」。趙今確認說法，並解釋做法是「要釐清我當時嘅 perception（認知）係唔係好準確嘅」，因此要更正「反對」這個字眼。他又解釋有此理解是因為與司馬文的說法相比，司馬文當時在協調會上清楚講明「反對否決財政預算案」，並因應之後發展無參與初選及官方選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙指何桂藍於鄒家成熱烈討論時提到將立會變抗爭陣地稱民主黨代表屬少數&quot;&gt;趙指何桂藍於鄒家成熱烈討論時提到將立會變「抗爭陣地」、稱民主黨代表屬少數&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續指，趙早前指何桂藍曾提及望將立法會變成「抗爭陣地」，將制度「推到盡」，問是什麼時候聽到何這樣說？趙稱是在協調會議。趙早前指，因他會上已聽到相關訊息，故着助手黎敬輝無需記錄；而他亦曾指在新東首次會議，鄒家成和莊榮輝有熱烈討論（heated exchange）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，那何桂藍的話是在該討論之前抑或之後發生？趙指，何的說法亦是包含在該「熱烈討論（heated exchange）」之內，「咁所以我就係同返黎敬輝講，呢個我都睇到啦，所以佢就唔使記低」，並指要補充「其實係佢（黎敬輝）主動問我，因為嗰 part 真係太多人講嘢，要花好多時間記錄，所以佢咁樣問我」，鄒家成皺眉。李運騰指，故熱烈的討論是在不同人之間，而不止是鄒家成和莊榮輝？趙同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙早前供稱，約有30人出席首次新東會議，陳慶偉問，那莊是屬於少數嗎？趙指「我觀察嘅形勢係相對 minority（少數）」，並指會上有超過一半本土抗爭派，鄒家成搖頭。陳再指，趙亦提及民主動力在會上亦被挑戰，趙同意，強調因為「民主動力成日畀本土抗爭派攻擊係傳統民主派嘅大台，想控制所有嘢咁樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2023, the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at RUSI convened a roundtable in partnership with the Latvian Institute of International Affairs in Riga. The discussion, held under the Chatham House Rule, gathered representatives from government ministries and agencies, and the private sector – including banking institutions, law firms and consulting companies. The roundtable was hosted by the Financial Intelligence Unit of Latvia. The event is part of RUSI’s ongoing study of EU sanctions implementation and wider responses to illicit finance (Euro SIFMANet), funded by the National Endowment for Democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable discussion opened by finding a consensus on how well prepared Latvia was for the sanctions. Representatives from the FIU Latvia described how in the past several years, Latvia has undergone a significant overhaul of its national Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation Finance (AML/CFT/CPF) system, and its risk exposure to these threats has been at the top of the political and executive agenda. The process included rigorous transformations under the eye of the Financial Action Task Force and Moneyval’s International Co-operation and Review Group (ICRG) process. Through this process, Latvia worked to embed a high level of AML/CFT/CPF risk understanding and capacity by amending existing laws and supplementing them to comply with FATF Recommendations and enforcement measures, such as increasing the criminalisation of money laundering and predicate crimes (including ‘violation’ of sanctions), and setting up new institutional arrangements, such as a specialised Economic Affairs Court. Supervisors such as the Central Bank (Bank of Latvia) and the Financial and Capital Markets Commission worked to significantly improve guidance and feedback loops with supervised entities, and bolster internal control systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from Latvia’s Central Bank noted that the reforms ensured that the financial sector was ‘combat-trained’ for the implementation of the Russia restrictive measures regime following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Latvia built its current sanctions regime based on its experience with the post-2014 Crimean, Belarusian and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions. A representative from the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) described how the MFA created a sanctions division as a result of the Moneyval process, ensuring that sanctions were already front-and-centre in policy discussions at the time of the Russian invasion in 2022. The guidance and training that Latvia received throughout the ICRG process and from partners such as OFAC strengthened Latvia’s system to the point that it is now itself providing training to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latvian authorities described the national sanctions implementation framework as highly decentralised, with multiple agencies sharing a wide range of responsibilities. Despite the challenges posed by this decentralised system, participants agreed that the sanctions regime has been effective, in large part due to the financial sector reform of the previous few years. Violation of sanctions (both of EU and UN sanctions) is a criminal offence in Latvia, the sanctioned person and entity list is publicly available, and regular public–private collaboration ensures everyone is on the same page. In 2022, Latvian banks identified 35 entities linked to sanctioned entities or persons and froze more than €80 million. FIU Latvia received around 300 STRs, mostly linked to the evasion of sectoral sanctions. Supervisors have also conducted on-site inspections to ensure effective compliance. Tax and customs police initiated 114 criminal proceedings in relation to sanctions violation. The four major Latvian banks have stopped executing transactions to and from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;latvias-challenges&quot;&gt;Latvia’s Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative of the financial sector association, Finance Latvia, noted two main challenges. The first major challenge of sanctions stems mainly from a lack of cross-border harmonisation on legislation and implementation. How the issue of ‘control’ over an entity is identified in different countries often varies, creating confusion in handling activities that may be deemed sanctions evasion. A further issue cited by the private sector was the challenge of how to treat the risk from Russian sanctions targets using Central Asian countries for evasion and circumvention, ‘contaminating’ business dealings in that region. In addition, private sector actors pointed to the lack of sanctions-evasion prevention capacity in corporate sectors subject to sectoral sanctions. A shortage of sanctions expertise has limited the ability of these industries to raise their capabilities. Finance Latvia explained their ongoing trainings and seminars with their members’ clients, but it is difficult to make them catch up and build capacity for a capability that the financial sector has been engaged in since even before 2014. With this lack of capacity in mind, while it is important to ensure a rapid build-up of implementation capacity, the application of this capacity should be monitored, in order to prevent a cascade of de-risking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from the Customs Authority highlighted that the main challenge is not in the checking of goods but checking the connections between persons. The Latvian border is naturally at a high risk of exposure to organised crime and drug and alcohol trafficking. The monitoring process is further complicated by the number of exceptions in the customs and trade sanctions regimes, together with the tendency for transporters to use double sets of documentation that hide the legitimate destination of goods and get swapped once they cross the border to obfuscate trade between Russia, Central Asia and Latvia. In general, the customs representative highlighted that more could be done by the EU in this regard. For example, FRONTEX provides funds and support for building capacity to address people crossing the EU’s external borders, but not goods. Participants made a strong argument that as Latvia is among the few member states with direct exposure to Russia via a common border, more resources should be concentrated there to prevent sanctions breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The representatives of the Employers Confederation emphasised that, in general, communication from the Latvian government has been very effective. However, they highlighted their experience with the overburdened systems of compliance of sanctions implementation, noting that members have repeatedly experienced funds getting seriously delayed in transactions with Central Asian counterparties. Participants found that more institutional collaboration between Latvia and Central Asia could result in better understanding of risks from this region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a clear consensus among participants about the additional difficulty stemming from Latvia’s close geographical proximity to Russia and Belarus. Certain designated entities had a substantial economic presence in Latvia, generating doubts about the best way to proceed with paying salaries, taxes or the continuity of economic activity generally. These payment complications have resulted in a trend of Latvian businesses trying to find banking options outside Latvia (notably in Lithuania), making oversight even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from both public and private sectors noted on multiple occasions that effective sanctions compliance in Latvia was possible for numerous reasons, but that continued access to the Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) Registry is an important one. The Registry started conducting analysis of ownership to support banks and businesses in complying with sanctions. The new power they received led the Registry to become a form of analytical centre in support of sanctions implementation. Unlike many other EU countries where beneficial ownership registries have been closed to public access as a result of a ruling by the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) in 2022, in Latvia, the government has been able to keep the Registry open. Latvia is one of the most open countries in the world regarding the availability of UBO data to the public and does not solely base its national legal framework on the legal norm currently repealed by the judgment of the CJEU. The Latvian framework was established before the 5th Directive came into force and had already assessed the balance of data privacy and public disclosure within the scope of other normative acts. As SIFMANet has found in other countries where registries have been closed, such action significantly complicates and impairs the effectiveness of sanctions implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, as sanctions become more sophisticated, the roundtable reached a consensus that the highly decentralised model followed by Latvia can be improved. FIU Latvia described the centralisation effort underway, via a newly designed body, to try to remedy this issue, and build a faster and more reliable feedback loop between the public and private sectors. The aim of this effort is to coordinate approaches and hold singular decision-making power, making it possible to support affected entities and make quick and effective judgements where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latvian authorities also found the need for centralisation to be a key element at the EU level. The challenges posed by the current lack of harmonisation in the EU must be addressed. While sanctions evasion is a crime in Latvia, it is not wholly criminalised in the EU, resulting in different levels of prioritisation in sanctions evasion prevention among partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, participants also agreed that the current state of beneficial ownership registries in the EU needs to be remedied. Registries must include accurate, up-to-date and accessible data. Although open registries should be the goal, even countries with an open and accessible registry (for example, the UK) suffer from unreliability because their data is unverified and therefore untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, though the role of Latvia as a gateway of financial flows eastward has been largely restricted, trade between Latvia and its neighbours continues. Representatives from the public and private sectors asserted that resources and staffing must continue to be dedicated to ensuring compliance with sanctions; and more international collaboration will be required to bolster the strength of the Latvian and Baltic borders, as this is also the main external border of the EU with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there was consensus at the roundtable that the European Commission must communicate more thoroughly with the private sector in regard to sectoral sanctions, otherwise this duty of informing businesses in the EU falls solely on the financial sector, which may not be best equipped to carry this burden alone. In this sense, participants agreed that the EU and national competent authorities should engage more with the private sector during the design of sanctions and immediately following their publication, to ensure that the desired measures are effectively implemented by the relevant sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
