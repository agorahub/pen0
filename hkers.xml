&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News of a draft peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan is a positive note during a tumultuous period for European security. This deal sets up the opportunity to bring an end to over four decades of conflict. However, tensions remain high and trust low. It is unclear whether the draft agreement sets up an enduring peace, or if remaining gaps will fracture this delicate balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wider implications of Armenian-Azerbaijani normalisation should not be underestimated. A successful peace deal would open up economic and diplomatic opportunities for the entire region, particularly in the energy and transportation sectors. The new “realist” reality emerging within the South Caucasus will necessitate external actors adapt their policy towards the region while Europe seems set to struggle to retain its remaining influence. Peace is not guaranteed and will require significant support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-pathway-to-peace&quot;&gt;The Pathway to Peace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenian-Azerbaijani tensions stem from a long-standing territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but until recently has been under the control of the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh. There has been an inter-ethnic rivalry over Karabakh for over a century, while suppressed during the Soviet period, it has intensified over the last few decades resulting a long-standing dispute with two major wars and frequent border skirmishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After four years of a shaky ceasefire following the Second Karabakh War, the draft agreement has been finalised, and both countries are preparing consultations on its signing. Negotiations have been fraught with problems with Russia and the West achieving little success in progressing the agenda. Instead, this draft agreement is notable, being achieved bilaterally, extraneous to third-party mediation, largely due to the dynamics of this dyadic relationship. Azerbaijan achieved a resounding victory in 2020, and its successful dissolution of the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh in January 2024 solidified their dominant position at the negotiating table, allowing it to determine the agenda with Armenia taking the lion’s share of concessions. Azerbaijan has been vocal in wanting to limit Western involvement in the peace process and consequently Armenia has acquiesced to the removal of the EU monitoring mission from its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperative measures stipulated within the agreement include a joint request for the dissolution of the Minsk group and the withdrawal of each state’s international court case against the other. Hopefully, these unified measures are taken in good faith and can kickstart the trust-building process between these states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what appears to be a decision undertaken to expedite the peace process, several unresolved issues have been omitted. Firstly, neither side will seek to resettle refugees forced out of their lands due to any stage of the conflict. Both sides have had hundreds of thousands of displaced refugees throughout the conflict who will remain a significant political and societal pressure. Secondly, the Zangezur corridor, a proposed transport link between Azerbaijan and its exclave Nakhichevan through Armenia has been excluded from the draft. It is a primary source of contention for both sides that was removed from the peace agenda. However, it remains an issue that Baku will seek to address in the future. Leaving this friction unresolved risks the long-term success of this peace agreement, but Armenia may attempt to buy time through the normalisation process to find an acceptable solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there remains a significant roadblock to achieving peace. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan maintain that the other’s constitution contains territorial claims that infringe upon their own sovereignty. Azerbaijan has asserted that Armenia must alter its constitution before a peace deal can be signed. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has stated that Armenia requires a new constitution that represents “Real Armenia”, but the renouncement of a claim to Karabakh has received significant pushback from Armenian opposition. With upcoming elections expected in 2026, the population will be able to voice their support either way. However, it is hard to see how a different leader could shift Armenia’s negotiating position without instigating conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Armenia’s numerous concessions, this recent announcement has been denounced by Armenian opposition as a capitulation to Azerbaijan. This highlights an emerging split within Armenian society between those who desire peace at all costs, and those who believe this cost to be too great. Armenian Foreign minister Ararat Mirzoyan’s statement that a peace deal will help Armenia “emerge from a large and deep swamp” is indicative of the government’s perception of its position. However, conveying this message to its population will require delicacy to stem criticism, which has often been exploited by Russia’s propaganda machine, risking further destabilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regional-impact&quot;&gt;Regional Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has historically considered the South Caucasus to be firmly within its sphere of influence, as such it has consistently sought to maintain its influence within the region. In a strategy very similar to its interference within Transnistria, Abkhazia and the Donbas (prior to 2022), the Kremlin has exploited regional tensions over Nagorno-Karabakh to insert itself as a security provider, increasing its leverage over Yerevan and Baku in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has struggled to retain its influence within the South Caucasus. The removal of Russian troops from Nagorno-Karabakh in April 2024 and from the Turkish-Armenian border in March 2025 have chipped away at its regional pre-eminence leaving it without a clear policy towards the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Russia is recalibrating its position within the South Caucasus, shifting from a security focus to a broader strategy utilising political, economic and primarily subversive levers while acknowledging the influx of other regional actors within this space. However, Armenia has made clear attempts to diminish Russian influence by freezing its participation within the Collective Security Treaty Organisation and intensifying national debate on aligning with the European Union. Russia has even less influence over Azerbaijan who maintains strong political and military links to Turkey. Following a peace treaty, Yerevan and Baku will be better positioned to enact further policy to limit Russian influence but will require support from other regional actors to facilitate this difficult transition away from Russian influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iran&quot;&gt;Iran&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s relationship with its Northern neighbours fluctuates depending on the focus. Both Azerbaijan and Armenia have interests in improving relations with Iran, but each encounters significant roadblocks in achieving this aim. Iran has a sizable ethnic Azeri population within its North-Western region and both states have interests in facilitating the International North South Transport Corridor from Moscow to Mumbai, through their territory. However, Baku’s blossoming relationship with Israel is a point of serious contention between the two states. Armenia has benefitted from Iranian support of its territorial integrity but must be cautious in balancing its relations with Tehran and the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bilateral delimitation of the Armenian-Azerbaijani border is a positive step for Iran, that economically and politically benefits from its border with Armenia. Iran prioritises the de-westernisation of the South Caucasus. With the Zangezur corridor issue remaining unanswered, Iran’s proposed solution involving transit via its territory is a compromise that is mutually agreeable for now, but unlikely to prove to be a long-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan would allow Baku to reapply focus upon other points of contention. The repression of ethnic Azeris within Iran may become an increasingly volatile issue. With no long-term connectivity solution that benefits Tehran, and a potential brewing ethnic conflict, Iran’s position within the South Caucasus has significantly weakened as it struggles to influence regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turkey&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tandem with Turkish influence filling the vacuum left by a retreating Iran in the Middle East, a successful peace deal will provide Ankara the opportunity to weaken both Moscow and Tehran’s position within the South Caucasus. Turkey’s strategic partnership with Azerbaijan was instrumental in Baku’s rapid military development and eventual strong negotiating position. Its relationship with Armenia remains challenging, but according to Pashinyan, normalisation “will simply be a matter of time”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased stability within the region opens the door for the Middle Corridor initiative to flourish, limiting Russia’s role within Eurasian trade and providing Turkey with a stronger link to its Central Asian partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Turkey chooses to balance its relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan will be a strong determinant of a successful peace. Overall Turkey’s rising dominance in the region would be the most influential outcome of this peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;european-union&quot;&gt;European Union&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Azerbaijan requesting the removal of the EU monitoring mission from the Armenian border, it’s likely that the EU will lose its last mediating tool within this peace process. This is not an unexpected shift; the EU’s mediation attempts between 2022 and 2023 failed to generate any significant momentum and was unable to prevent a cessation in hostilities during this period. Europe appeared to miss its opportunity to successfully insert itself within the mediation and as a result, has become a bystander to regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the stark shift in Transatlantic relations, instigated by the 2nd Trump administration, the EU has refocused upon its own security and with its attention drawn between the US, Russia, and China it will likely lead to a continued lack of focus upon peripheral regions such as the South Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a serious question over what the EU can do to regain influence within the region. Georgia’s pivot from the West is indicative of long-term problems with the EU’s waning attraction to its neighbours. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan are interested in pursuing multi vector foreign policy which other influencers have proven much better adapted to. Peace is beneficial for the EU, but without a renewed EU strategy towards the region, its influence will continue to diminish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement on terms of an Armenian-Azerbaijan peace deal is a significant development for the South Caucasus and the implications of greater stability within the region have wide reaching impact. However, if signed, the longevity of this agreement remains uncertain. Trust between signatories remains low and irredentism remains a significant risk. The South Caucasus’ location at the crossroads of Asia and Europe means that while the topic of connectivity remains unresolved, it is one that will dominate discussion over the next few years. Europe should not lose focus on this key region of its Eastern flank and should engage with this emerging opportunity rather than relying on outdated policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air in Helsinki is heavy with irony. Finnish attitudes towards NATO changed abruptly following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Just two months after the start of the invasion, almost 80% of the public had come around to support NATO membership. When Finland entered the Alliance on 4th April 2023, parts of the political establishment hailed this as the end point of the country’s long trek to join the West, finally making Finland a full member of a security community of like-minded liberal democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the re-election of Donald Trump. President Trump’s harsh treatment of Ukraine as well as a conditional commitment to NATO’s collective defence evaporated any lingering sense of complacency in Helsinki. Just 50% of the public now say they trust the United States. Prime Minister Petteri Orpo told citizens that whilst he retained confidence in Finland’s most important ally, he also acknowledged that the United States had changed. Just two years ago, Finland’s NATO accession had seemingly cracked its century-old dilemma of surviving next door to its former overlord and great power neighbour, Russia. Now, according to an unconfirmed newspaper report, Finland has begun exploring a Plan B in case NATO’s Article 5 fails to function as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comment evaluates Helsinki’s options regarding its national security. We argue that a viable Plan B exists – the “Nordic Plus” – but, like all European defence initiatives, it comes with uncertainties and cannot compensate for potential US disengagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plan-a-american-led-alliance&quot;&gt;Plan A: American-Led Alliance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland’s Plan A builds heavily on its alliance relationship with the United States, which played a central role in supporting Finland’s path to NATO. President Biden affirmed America’s “ironclad commitment” to Article 5, directed his military to conduct nearly constant training missions in Finland, and visited Helsinki to mark the country’s “NATOzation”. Furthermore, in December 2023, Finland signed a Defence Cooperation agreement with the United States, anticipating American investments in Finnish military infrastructure as well as a regular presence of US troops and personnel in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, two months into his second term, President Trump has already made clear his interest-based and transactional approach to foreign affairs, as well as his tendency to shift his perception of US interests from one day to the next. For the next four years, the implementation of Article 5 relies on a somewhat whimsical American president who has on multiple public occasions expressed confidence in Russian president Vladimir Putin over America’s longstanding European allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, President Trump has noted that there is an ocean between America and Europe. Consequently, Russia’s territorial ambitions in Eastern Europe do not appear to pose a threat to the United States. To paraphrase Lord Ismay, NATO was established to keep America in, Germany down, and Russia out – a goal that previous US administrations largely upheld. By contrast, influential figures within the Trump administration have expressed indifference towards Europe’s security, support for Alternative für Deutschland, and sympathy for certain aspects of Russia’s foreign policy. As a result, at the time of writing, the credibility of Finland’s Plan A is undeniably eroding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nordic-plus-as-a-plan-b&quot;&gt;Nordic Plus as a Plan B&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would a possible Plan B look like? It can be summed up as “Nordic Plus”. NATO membership has unlocked significant new potential for military cooperation between Finland and its allies. In this context, Finnish leaders will likely turn to Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, and, potentially, France. Logistically, the Scandinavian countries play a crucial role in supplying Finland in the event of war, and Finland has been advocating for major improvements in Nordic connectivity and infrastructure. Moreover, these countries can potentially provide considerable military capabilities. For instance, together the countries have an air force of 200 modern fighter jets. However, as affluent nations, Norway and Sweden could still allocate significant additional societal resources to collective defence, such as considerably expanding the conscription system for force generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to larger European powers, the United Kingdom, seen as a serious security provider with a genuine interest in Northern European security, could potentially offer a wide spectrum of military support on land, at sea and in the air, also providing special capabilities such as intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance. Moreover, France – an additional European heavyweight – could also contribute to Finland’s deterrence, particularly through its nuclear weapons. It is not inconceivable that Finnish skies could soon host training missions by nuclear-capable French fighter jets if Paris is truly prepared to introduce a European dimension to its nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Finland’s traditional support of the EU’s defence efforts will remain significant. Finland has given its full support to the European Commission’s recent efforts to foster European rearmament and strongly urged EU leaders to convene a defence-focused summit, which eventually took place on 6 March. Fiscally conservative Helsinki is also warming up to the idea of raising common debt to bankroll the building of an autonomous European military-industrial complex. It is also prepared to make the defence-related articles of the Lisbon Treaty more credible and concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lingering mistrust towards the United States, Finnish decision makers will strive to keep the transatlantic flame alive. Finland will do everything it can to present itself as a helpful partner to President Trump and thus avoid direct rupture in the transatlantic linkage. There is also the hope that America may recommit to playing the role of a backstop in NATO under a future administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-europe-able-to-muster-military-force&quot;&gt;Is Europe Able to Muster Military Force?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the key question for Finnish foreign policy today is whether Plan B will work if it needs to be duly activated. The key challenge for Finnish foreign policy is ensuring Western European commitment to the defence of NATO’s frontline states. However, Western European countries that are not directly threatened by Russia will be tempted to free ride by outsourcing defence costs to their Eastern European neighbours. Perceptions of the threat are inversely affected by a country’s distance from Russia. Even Finland’s closest neighbours, Sweden and Norway, enjoy the benefit of having a Finnish buffer between them and Russia, although they also have a considerable interest in Finland’s territorial integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the ongoing momentum for Europe to step up, the continent, lacking corporate agency in defence matters, will face significant challenges in coordinating its security in the absence of American leadership, if history is any guide. In the 1920s, America decided to disengage from Europe’s problems. Britain and France stepped into the breach and sought to ensure European security. Unfortunately, Britain and France were economically and militarily too weak to effectively deter the ambitions of revisionist states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These material limitations were amplified by arguments that questioned the relevance of Eastern European conflicts for Western European security. For instance, Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain wrote in 1925 that no British government would risk the bones of a British soldier over an Eastern European border dispute. Similar voices in the 2020s will undoubtedly be amplified by Russia. Russia will continue to assert that it has no territorial ambitions beyond Ukraine and seeks mutually beneficial relations with Western European countries, including Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-plan-b-fails&quot;&gt;If Plan B Fails&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the follow up question of what Finland might do if Europe’s efforts to mobilise collective deterrence against Russia are unsuccessful. Currently, there is very little public discussion of a Plan C. Finnish decision makers are focused on reassuring a jittery public by underlining Finland’s efforts to foster European security coordination, day-to-day cooperation with the United States, and independent defence capability. These efforts undoubtedly ensure sufficient deterrence whilst Russia’s offensive capability remains engaged in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a scenario in which Europe’s efforts to mobilise collective deterrence against Russia fail is not inconceivable. This would significantly weaken Finland’s deterrence, as Ukraine’s experience demonstrates that Finland can only successfully deter Russia with external support. If maintaining allied support for Finnish security becomes increasingly difficult, it is possible that Finland will explore the possibility of a Plan C based on rapprochement with Russia. That said, Helsinki will take this road with considerable reluctance and only if forced by external circumstances and would still retain significant national defence capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland’s two-year rollercoaster ride in NATO underlines the futility of predicting the future in international relations. The next two years in Finnish foreign policy will undoubtedly contain new surprises. Even so, it is likely that Helsinki will aim to keep its options open and has possibly already begun laying conditions for all eventualities. Though Finland is likely increasingly focused on a Plan B of fostering collective European deterrence, it will continue to extend its hand to America and, if other attempts fail, prepare ground for a possible exploration of détente with Russia. This balancing act will require a permanently heightened level of defence spending, considerable diplomatic dexterity, and a willingness to question received wisdom. After a short interlude, history has returned to Helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;

This report explores the legal tools and policy frameworks shaping allied export controls and the challenges of alignment with U.S. national security requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since October 2022, the United States has devoted significant resources to restricting China’s access to artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced semiconductor technologies. In the final months of the Biden administration, the Department of Commerce issued four additional far-reaching export control updates. On December 2, 2024, it released two rules that added 140 companies to the Entity List, expanded the scope of the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR), and restricted new technology areas such as high-bandwidth memory, among other measures. In the second week of January 2025, the Department of Commerce issued the AI Diffusion Framework and the Foundry Due Diligence Rule, further shaping the spread of AI and semiconductor technologies throughout the world. Export controls remain front and center for the second Trump administration, which directed an effort to “identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls—especially those that enable the transfer of strategic goods, software, services, and technology . . . to strategic rivals and their proxies” on its first day in office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, countries like the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan continue to control key chokepoints in the AI and semiconductor value chain, making unilateral action only so effective. Furthermore, the existing multilateral export control architecture is neither sufficiently flexible nor fast to allow for the kind of sophisticated, targeted controls that the United States has levied on China. The success or failure of the U.S. export control strategy is thus dependent on its allies’ ability to implement controls outside of this traditional architecture or U.S. extraterritorial regulations covering allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper provides an in-depth analysis of U.S. allies’ export control authorities related to AI and semiconductor technologies and does the same analysis for China. It demonstrates that U.S. allies often do not have equivalents to U.S. export control authorities and tools like the FDPR and Entity List, but that they generally do have the capability to introduce some controls on advanced semiconductor chips and related equipment not covered by multilateral export control regimes. As a result, lack of alignment with the U.S. export control regime cannot necessarily be attributed to a lack of authorities alone. Allies’ enforcement capacity and willingness to act are also key ingredients in the implementation of effective export controls and are crucial to the success of U.S. and allied technology competition with China. Accordingly, the recommendations section of this paper addresses each of these three elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper proceeds as follows. First, it identifies key export control authorities used by the United States to slow the progress of China’s AI and semiconductor industries and analyzes which other countries possess these authorities and are thus capable of implementing similar controls. It then surveys the export control policies of key actors, including the European Union, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China. It concludes by offering recommendations to U.S. and allied policymakers to make AI and semiconductor export controls more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2023, then–Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo clearly outlined the U.S. strategy for China and its AI ecosystem when she said, “America leads the world in artificial intelligence. America leads the world in advanced semiconductor design, period. . . . We’re a couple years ahead of China. No way are we going to let them catch up.” To achieve this goal, the U.S. national security enterprise has undertaken a massive, multifaceted effort to choke off China’s access to cutting-edge AI and related technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls on the high-performance semiconductors used to train and inference state-of-the-art AI models have been at the forefront of this effort so far. On October 7, 2022, the United States enacted a comprehensive set of export controls on advanced semiconductor technologies. Although these controls marked the reversal of nearly 30 years of trade policy, they did not achieve all of their intended goals. U.S. chip designers like Nvidia continued to provide Chinese customers with slightly lower-performance chips, which according to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), provided “nearly comparable AI model training capability.” In October 2023, the United States updated these controls to cover a much larger set of chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME). As noted in a previous CSIS report, “The United States is firmly focused on retaining control over so-called ‘chokepoint’ . . . technologies in the global semiconductor technology supply chain.” The United States issued major export control updates in December 2024 and January 2025 that continued in this vein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the significant resources successive administrations have devoted to restricting China’s access to AI and semiconductor technologies, China’s AI ecosystem remains competitive with the United States’. In May 2024, Chinese AI company DeepSeek released a best-in-class open-weight model reportedly trained on Nvidia A100 chips stockpiled before the October 2022 controls went into effect. The even more impressive Deepseek-R1 reasoning model was trained on Nvidia H800 chips, which were not restricted before October 2023. The performance of DeepSeek-R1 was so far beyond what the financial analyst community had expected a Chinese firm to be capable of that the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 3.1 percent in one day as a result of its release. This previous CSIS paper provides an in-depth analysis of DeepSeek and its implications for U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-us-ai-and-semiconductor-export-control-authorities-and-related-tools&quot;&gt;Key U.S. AI and Semiconductor Export Control Authorities and Related Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of the U.S. chip war strategy is a group of iteratively developed and highly sophisticated export control tools. Authorities granted in the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA), Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and executive orders offer the U.S national security community a range of options to control the export, reexport, transit, or transfer of select military, dual-use, and purely commercial items and technologies. In the House Committee on Foreign Affairs markup of ECRA, then–committee chairman Congressman Edward Royce stated that ECRA “closes gaps in our export controls that could permit transfers of cutting-edge technology like artificial intelligence and advanced semiconductors to potential adversaries such as Beijing.” More accurately, ECRA represented the codification of U.S. export control powers that had previously relied on authorities in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and had a novel focus on emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. export control regime divides the responsibilities for administering and enforcing export controls on dual-use and military goods and technologies. The Department of Commerce is responsible for regulating the flow of dual-use technologies and less sensitive military items, which covers advanced semiconductors and related technologies, through the BIS. Meanwhile, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) within the U.S. Department of State oversees and licenses weapons and munitions that are covered by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) at the Treasury Department oversees restrictions on exports based on financial sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four kinds of U.S. export controls most relevant to the Trump and Biden administrations’ efforts to choke off China’s access to AI are described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; List-based controls impose restrictions on specific commodities, software, and technologies. The United States primarily implements this kind of control through the Commerce Control List (CCL). The CCL includes dual-use items described by Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), which may require licenses to export. Maintained by BIS, the CCL has played a crucial role in both the Trump and Biden administration’s controls. For example, in October 2022 BIS created four new unilateral ECCNs related to high-performance chips and related SME and software. Meanwhile, the January 2025 AI Diffusion Framework created ECCN 4E091 to control AI model weights, which had not previously been controlled. To determine whether a license is granted for an item on the CCL, BIS also takes into consideration its intended end-user, the destination of the export, and its end-use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; End-user controls impose restrictions on the export, reexport, and transfer of items destined for specific actors. BIS primarily implements this kind of control via the Entity List. The Entity List refers to people, companies, facilities, and government institutions that participate in “activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States” and are subject to a license requirement. With each export control update, the United States has added Chinese firms to the Entity List including major AI and semiconductor companies like Huawei, YMTC, and Naura Technology Group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; End-use controls impose restrictions on otherwise uncontrolled items for certain end-uses. For example, EAR sections 744.2, 744.3, and 744.4 impose license requirements on almost any item that might be used in the creation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). In the context of AI chips and related technologies, BIS created a new license restriction based on whether items would be used in the production of advanced node semiconductors—defined as logic chips at or below 16 nanometers (nm), DRAM memory chips at or below 18 nm, and NAND storage at or above 128 layers—as part of the October 2022 controls. This definition was changed as part of the December 2024 export control update and then again in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Services controls impose restrictions on the activities of companies or individuals when the underlying commodities, software, and technologies involved in the service are not otherwise controlled. BIS implements this type of control under the U.S. Persons Rule. This authority controls the activities of U.S. companies or citizens when they are in support of certain end-uses found in EAR section 744.6. Traditionally, the U.S. Persons Rule applied license requirements to “U.S. persons,” defined as both people and firms, if they were engaging in activities supporting the development, production, or use of WMDs, even in situations not involving items subject to the EAR (i.e., wholly foreign-origin technology). However, as part of the October 2022 controls, BIS informed all “U.S. persons” that any activities in support of advanced node semiconductor production in China required a license. In doing so, BIS made the novel judgment that the act of supporting the development or production of advanced node semiconductors and related equipment “could involve ‘support’ for . . . weapons of mass destruction-related end-uses.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these four export control types, there are three further export control features that require explanation to understand U.S. AI and semiconductor export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilateral regime-based versus unilateral or plurilateral:&lt;/strong&gt; Most allied countries’ export control systems are grounded in multilateral agreements primarily focused on WMD nonproliferation like the Wassenaar Arrangement, which is the successor to the Cold War–era Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM); the Nuclear Suppliers Group; the Australia Group; and the Missile Technology Control Regime. These regimes provide lists of commodities, software, and technology unanimously agreed on by members that should be subject to license requirements, in addition to end-use and services controls related to WMDs. However, the Trump and Biden administrations’ AI and semiconductor export controls have focused on items not included in multilateral agreements and were initially implemented unilaterally, and then as a part of a plurilateral agreement (as in the case of the reported deal between the United States, Netherlands, and Japan).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country-specific application:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. list-based, end-use, and services controls also can apply on a country-specific basis. For example, the October 2022 controls introduced measures banning the sale of high-end AI chips to any entity operating in China. Similarly, the October 2022 controls introduced a U.S. Persons Rule that applied on a China-specific basis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extraterritoriality:&lt;/strong&gt; In some cases, U.S. controls apply to foreign-produced items located outside the United States if they are a direct product of U.S. technology or software, or if they were produced by equipment that was the direct product of such technology or software. BIS implements this type of control through the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR). This authority allowed the United States to address a loophole in the pre-October 2022 controls. Namely, Chinese firms were accessing controlled SME, components, and spare parts from U.S. companies without a license via foreign headquartered and domiciled partners. By applying the FDPR more broadly with each export control update, BIS, at least in theory, addressed this challenge. In the December 2024 controls, BIS dramatically expanded the FDPR yet again, meaning that foreign-produced SME “that contain any amount of U.S.-origin integrated circuits” are subject to U.S. controls. Per this version of the rule, U.S.-origin integrated circuits includes any such chips manufactured with U.S. machines, meaning that effectively all chips on earth are considered U.S. origin. This authority was also central to the export control updates issued in January 2025. For example, the AI Diffusion Framework rule expanded the FDPR to AI model weights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has also employed a range of other economic security tools to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductor technologies. For example, in August 2023 the Biden administration used IEEPA to issue an executive order directing the U.S. Treasury Department to establish a program to review outbound investments in national critical sectors such as AI and semiconductors. This measure followed reporting that U.S. firms were investing in Chinese AI companies that were on the Entity List. On October 28, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department issued its final rule on the implementation of the executive order, which went into effect on January 2, 2025, but is now subject to review as a result of the Trump administration’s America First Trade Policy memorandum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-for-allies&quot;&gt;The Need for Allies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However vigorously the United States pursues its own export control strategy, it will be unable to achieve success without changing the behavior of other countries. While the United States holds a strong position in certain parts of the semiconductor value chain like chip design, other countries such as the Netherlands and Japan also play crucial roles in areas like SME. For example, Dutch company ASML is the sole provider of the latest generation of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines needed to make cutting-edge AI chips. The consulting firm Accenture estimated that the inputs to a typical semiconductor chip “could cross international borders approximately 70 or more times before finally making it to the end customer.” In other words, the United States does not control all the relevant chokepoints required to execute its export control strategy. In comments after the October 2022 controls went into effect, one U.S. official told Reuters, “We recognize that the unilateral controls that we are putting in place will lose effectiveness over time if other countries don’t join us.” At the December 2024 Reagan National Defense Forum, Gina Raimondo reiterated this sentiment, albeit more forcefully, saying, “When I set the rules, I have to make damn sure China can’t just buy this stuff from Japan or Korea or the Europeans, so that’s why we have to work with them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully aware of this reality, Chinese officials have repeatedly threatened countries considering going along with the U.S. controls. For example, in a March 2022 interview, Tan Jian, China’s ambassador to the Netherlands, said, “This will not be without consequences. I’m not going to speculate on countermeasures, but China won’t just swallow this,” in response to the Netherlands’s increasing alignment with the United States on export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, U.S. allies have not kept pace with the United States’ increasingly restrictive export controls vis-à-vis China. While the U.S. export control system is designed to be able to keep up with technological developments and to be responsive to changing geopolitical circumstances, the regimes of its allies are generally not. As noted in the previous section, other countries with significant semiconductor industries have export control systems grounded in multilateral agreements primarily focused on WMD nonproliferation. These arrangements are significantly less agile than the U.S. system. For example, to add items to a Wassenaar Arrangement control list requires consensus from all participating countries, and opportunities for additions typically occur only once per year. As Wassenaar also includes Russia, which has obstructionist geopolitical goals, finding consensus on issues with geopolitical implications is unfeasible. In total, it can take up to three years to add a new item to Wassenaar control lists, even under favorable circumstances. Furthermore, Wassenaar explicitly prohibits controls targeting an individual country, noting in its founding document: “This arrangement will not be directed against any state or group of states.” Limited improvements have been made to export control coordination between U.S. allies, such as the informal “Wassenaar minus one” approach, an effort by like-minded countries to harmonize controls on items and technologies not listed in traditional multilateral agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the existing multilateral export control architecture remains inadequate for U.S. national security requirements. As a result, understanding allied countries’ unilateral export control authorities is crucial to the success or failure of the U.S. and allied technology competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ai-and-semiconductor-export-control-authorities-landscape&quot;&gt;The AI and Semiconductor Export Control Authorities Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allied countries possess significantly less comprehensive export control authorities than the United States. For the most part, they do not have an equivalent to key parts of the U.S. AI and semiconductor export control tool kit discussed in the previous sections like the FDPR, U.S. Persons Rule, Entity List, and restrictions that apply on a country-wide basis. This stands in radical contrast to China, which has passed no fewer than five laws since 2020 devoted to building a more sophisticated arsenal of economic security tools. In fact, China’s most recent update to its Export Control Law replicated several key U.S. export control authorities. The following sections compare U.S., allied, and Chinese export control authorities across list-based, end-user, end-use, and services controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;list-based-controls&quot;&gt;List-Based Controls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All U.S. allies implement the list-based controls found in the traditional four multilateral export control regimes. However, as shown in Table 1, they generally do have the ability to implement list-based controls outside of those regimes as well. For example, while the European Union does not have the power to require the imposition of export controls on semiconductor technologies, under Article 9 of 2021/821, EU member states are empowered to implement unilateral controls on otherwise uncontrolled items for “reasons of public security, including the prevention of acts of terrorism,” or for “human rights considerations.” The Netherlands specifically referenced Article 9 authorities when it issued its Regulation on Advanced Production Equipment for Semiconductors in June 2023, which introduced a license requirement on the export of previously uncontrolled SME from the country. Similarly, when the Japanese government revealed its plans to place license requirements on 23 types of SME in 2023, it did so with authorities granted under its Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act that was originally passed in 1949.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yuGS5K8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: U.S., Allied, and Chinese List-Based Export Control Authorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although allied countries do have the demonstrated ability to implement list-based controls unilaterally, it is misleading to think of their controls as equivalent to those issued by the United States. For example, no allied country has a meaningful equivalent to the FDPR, nor do they have controls on advanced node semiconductors that apply on a China-wide basis, with the partial exception of Taiwan. On the other hand, recent changes to China’s export control system have given Beijing the authority to implement list-based controls that apply on both a country-specific and extraterritorial basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;end-user-controls&quot;&gt;End-User Controls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multilateral export control regimes do not have an equivalent to the U.S. Entity List. As a result, allies have far less robust end-user restrictions than the United States. For example, the European Union and its member states simply do not have end-user restrictions and are forced to use sanctions authorities to impose controls on specific entities. Table 2 summarizes the end-user control landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ArYhFmG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: U.S., Allied, and Chinese End-User Export Control Authorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan all have the authority to impose end-user restrictions, their end-user authorities are more limited than the U.S. Entity List. For example, Japan’s end-user list only contains entities involved in the development, production, manufacturing, or storage of WMDs, or certain military end-uses. No allied country has put end-user controls on Chinese AI and semiconductor firms like the United States has, at least not publicly. As with list-based controls, allied countries lag far behind China when it comes to end-user controls. For example, in October 2024, China released its new dual-use export control regulation, which outlined a U.S. Entity List equivalent. Other regulations such as the Unreliable Entities List also give China options to target specific actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;end-use-controls&quot;&gt;End-Use Controls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multilateral export control regimes contain end-use (often referred to as “catch-all”) controls related to WMDs and certain military applications. For example, the Missile Technology Control Regime requires members to have end-use restrictions “controlling the export of items not included on a control list when they may be intended for use in connection with delivery systems for WMD[s].” Meanwhile, the Wassenaar Arrangement contains a “catch-all” provision designed to control unlisted dual-use items destined for a country subject to an arms embargo and intended for “military end-use.” As shown in Table 3, allied countries’ end-use controls are thus confined to WMD and military applications, with the potential exception of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ivAiNhi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: U.S., Allied, and Chinese End-Use Export Control Authorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, in October 2022, BIS introduced an end-use restriction related to the production of advanced node semiconductors in China. This move marked a major policy change, as U.S. end-use restrictions had previously been limited to situations involving WMDs. China also has the authority to implement end-use controls for reasons unrelated to WMDs. China’s 2020 Export Control Law provides a catch-all for any end-use that likely would endanger “[China’s] national security or national interests.” These terms are left largely undefined, providing Beijing with the ability to require licenses for a very broad set of unlisted items on an end-use basis if it desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;services-controls&quot;&gt;Services Controls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allied countries surveyed in this paper only apply services controls for WMD end-uses. However, there is a key difference in how the United States interprets what is covered under WMDs compared to its allies. In October 2022, BIS informed all U.S. persons that the act of supporting the development or production of advanced node semiconductors and related equipment in China “could involve ‘support’ for . . . weapons of mass destruction-related end uses,” and thus required a license. On the other hand, allied countries do not consider activities supporting the development or production of advanced node semiconductors to be related to WMDs and, as a result, do not imposes services controls on such activities. Table 4 summarizes the services controls landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ak1N7LV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 4: U.S., Allied, and Chinese Services Export Control Authorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite holding a more limited view of WMD-based export control restrictions than BIS, certain allies do restrict their citizens’ activities related to semiconductor manufacturing through other economic security tools. For example, according to a report by the Semiconductor Industry Association, South Korea has used its Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology “on numerous occasions to prevent firms transferring to mainland China technology deemed detrimental to the industrial competitive capabilities of Korean companies even in the absence of direct links to national security concerns associated with WMDs or conventional weapons.” Taiwan also restricts its citizens and firms from supporting the Chinese semiconductor industry through a variety of regulations unrelated to its export control regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-gaps-between-us-and-allied-export-control-regimes&quot;&gt;Key Gaps Between U.S. and Allied Export Control Regimes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated in the previous sections, allied countries possess far less expansive export control authorities than the United States. Although they are all capable of implementing list-based controls on advanced AI chips and SME, their export control tool kit is far narrower than what is available to BIS. For example, while the list-based controls announced by the Netherlands and Japan as part of a reported trilateral deal with the United States were a legitimate breakthrough in allied export control coordination, their controls were weaker than the U.S. regime in at least three important ways. Former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration Kevin Wolf summed up these defects in his February 2023 testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, which is quoted below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[The trilateral deal does not impose] controls on activities of Dutch or Japanese citizens in support of advanced node manufacturing in China. (The new BIS rules prohibit U.S. persons from providing support, even involving uncontrolled foreign-made items, to the development or production of advanced node semiconductors in China.) It will not involve any ally imposing end-user controls such as those related to the EAR’s Entity List. It will also not have controls specific to the . . . production of semiconductor production equipment in China. Thus, Japanese and Dutch companies will still be able to export to China items and services that U.S. competitor companies cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth adding to Wolf’s point that license applications for sales of U.S.-controlled chips to China generally face “a presumption of denial.” Thus, the U.S. policy imposes what is de jure a license requirement but de facto a ban. This is not always the case for U.S. allies. For example, in July 2023 Reuters reported that Japan’s controls would not be implemented on a presumption of denial basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only imposing simple list-based restrictions leaves allied countries vulnerable to the same failure modes that plagued earlier versions of the U.S. controls. For example, in July 2019, Japan issued an update to its export licensing policies, which removed South Korea from its “white countries” list of trusted trade partners and required individual export licenses for fluorinated polyimide, hydrogen fluoride, and related chemicals. A February 2023 World Bank analysis showed that in the absence of an FDPR equivalent, Japanese firms simply relocated production of the controlled chemicals from Japan to subsidiaries located in South Korea. While technically legal, these activities were in stark opposition to the intent of Japan’s controls and greatly limited their strategic impact. Similarly, for years the United States blocked direct sales of cutting-edge chips to customers explicitly affiliated with the Chinese military, while allowing those same chips to flow freely to commercial entities in China. While this policy ended direct sales from U.S. companies to the Chinese military, it was mostly ineffective at stopping indirect sales to the shell companies that helped the Chinese military evade export controls. The October 2022 controls addressed this by implementing restrictions that applied on a China-wide basis. Without equivalent measures, there are good reasons to think that allied countries’ controls will be susceptible to the same diversion risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Netherlands and Japan used existing authorities to implement unilateral controls on advanced semiconductor technologies also illustrates that analysis of authorities alone yields an incomplete understanding of international semiconductor export control dynamics. Whether Japan and the Netherlands’s reticence can be attributed to poor diplomatic coordination on behalf of the United States or a lack of political will on behalf of its allies is up for debate, but it cannot be entirely attributed to insufficient legal authorities. What is clear is that this delay harmed the U.S. strategic goals vis-à-vis China and its AI and semiconductor ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch and Japanese governments announced their plans to impose controls in line with the October 2022 update in March 2023, but enforcement did not take place until July 2023 in the case of Japan and September 2023 in the case of the Netherlands. This delay allowed Chinese firms to engage in a massive stockpiling effort. According to a Financial Times analysis of Chinese customs data, the total value of Chinese imports of SME increased from $2.9 billion in June and July 2022 to $5 billion over the same two months in 2023. The analysis further found that “most of the imports came from the Netherlands and Japan.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The December 2024 export control update showed that while U.S. policymakers are providing incentives to allies to align themselves with the U.S. export control regime, they are willing to unilaterally restrict the activity of firms headquartered in unaligned countries. For example, South Korean SME and high-bandwidth memory will be restricted by the expanded FDPR even for sales from South Korea, with a possible future exemption if the country implements controls equivalent to those in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections survey export control policies for the European Union, Netherlands, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;european-union&quot;&gt;European Union&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-1&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union lacks the export control authorities to compel its member states to follow U.S. restrictions on AI chips and related technologies. By the European Commission’s own admission, the European Union “does not have the necessary legal provisions to adopt at EU level uniform export controls.” Yet in the past 18 months, EU leadership has demonstrated a desire for greater involvement in the geopolitics of AI. In November 2023, the European Commission identified AI and semiconductors as “critical technology areas” that it would like to place restrictions on as it attempts to “de-risk” its relationship with China. Věra Jourová, one of the key proponents of the European Chips Act, stated, “Technology is currently at the heart of geopolitical competition and the EU wants to be a player, and not a playground.” At the February 2025 AI Action Summit, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen reiterated this sentiment, saying, “We want Europe to be one of the leading AI continents. . . . Too often, I hear that Europe is late to the race—while the U.S. and China have already gotten ahead. I disagree. . . . Global leadership is still up for grabs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked a major response in the form of what the EU Commission described as an “unprecedented and rapid expansion” of sanctions on military items and dual-use goods and technologies. The invasion also initiated a conversation about the role of Russia in obstructing the intended goals of the existing multilateral export control architecture. One European Commission export control strategy document noted, “Russia has blocked the adoption of important controls on emerging technologies in the Wassenaar Arrangement. . . . This raises serious questions on the capacity of multilateral export control regimes to deliver in times of serious geo-political tensions, and to ensure the security of the EU and the other members of the multilateral arrangements.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also began a discussion among EU policymakers about what economic security tools should be used against China, especially in light of China’s support for the Russian military. Furthermore, the 2021 U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council Export Control Working Group joint statement drew specific attention to the “civil-military fusion policies of certain actors,” a thinly veiled reference to China. For now, however, the European Union’s export controls vis-à-vis Beijing remain decidedly weaker than those of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-european-unions-export-control-regime&quot;&gt;The European Union’s Export Control Regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union set up its export control regime for dual-use items in the 1990s with a focus on preventing the proliferation of WMDs. In 2011, the European Commission ordered a review of its export control system to respond to demands from member states for a more flexible export control system. In 2021, Regulation 2021/821, often referred to as the EU Dual-Use Regulation, entered into law and governs the EU export control system as it exists today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This regulation was designed to allow the European Union to better cope with “today’s evolving and new security risks, rapid technological and scientific developments as well as transformations in trade and economic processes.” Despite expanding the European Union’s export control tool kit for dual-use technologies, the final regulation was significantly pared down compared to the original draft text. The regulation allows for the following kinds of controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Dual-use goods, software, and technology subject to license requirements are listed in Annex I of the EU Dual-Use Regulation. This list compiles items from multilateral export control agreements including the Wassenaar Arrangement, Nuclear Suppliers Group, Australia Group, and Missile Technology Control Regime. Additionally, in Annex IV of the regulation, there is a list of high-sensitivity items that require licenses even to be transferred within the European Union. The European Union also maintains a common list of military items. However, this list is nonbinding, and member states are responsible for legislating and implementing their own controls on military items.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The EU Dual-Use Regulation also includes catch-all controls covering use cases related to WMDs, military applications, and cyber surveillance. Notably, the cyber surveillance catch-all was implemented outside of the multilateral regime structure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The EU Dual-Use Regulation imposes license requirements on services related to three types of end-uses: “(i) weapons of mass destruction end use; (ii) military end-use in an arms embargoed country; or (iii) use as parts or components of military items exported without license or in violation thereof.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union requires member states to impose authorization requirements for controlled items. These requirements are a weak tool, however. Though the European Union may require member states to impose authorization requirements, national governments may choose to approve every application they receive. The challenge posed by the European Union’s narrow authorities is exacerbated by its limited enforcement capacity. The European Union’s role in implementing its export control regime is limited to administrative support; it does not process applications, investigate noncompliance, or prosecute violators. The limitations to its export control regime are the reason the European Union turned to sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While sanctions are a more agile tool than export controls (e.g., they allow for the targeting of a specific country), they require unanimity in the European Council to be implemented. The small set of countries and end-users under EU sanctions are also subject to export control restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the European Union does empower its members to implement unilateral export controls on items not covered by multilateral export control regimes. Article 9 of the EU Dual-Use Regulation provides EU member states with a legal mechanism to implement unilateral controls on otherwise unlisted items for “reasons of public security, including the prevention of acts of terrorism,” or for “human rights considerations.” Member states have been exercising these authorities with increasing frequency, particularly for restrictions on emerging technologies. The Netherlands, Spain, France, Germany, and Italy have all implemented unilateral export controls in the last two years. In an attempt to preserve the single market principle, the European Union publishes national control lists which in theory allow for export control coordination at the EU level. In practice, however, potential coordination is complicated by insufficient consultation between states and inconsistent national-level legal frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments&quot;&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2024, the European Commission adopted five initiatives to “strengthen the EU’s economic security at a time of growing geopolitical tensions and profound technological shifts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They include foreign direct investment (FDI) screening, improved member state export control coordination, and enhanced security around research and innovation sectors to avoid unwanted leakage. That same month, the European Commission released the final version of its white paper on export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the pivot to more aggressive economic security measures, EU leadership has expressed concern over recent U.S. export control action. For example, in response to the January 2025 AI Diffusion Framework, European Commission Executive Vice Presidents Henna Virkunen and Maroš Šefčovič issued a statement noting, “It is . . . in the U.S. economic and security interest that the EU buys advanced AI chips from the U.S. without limitations: we cooperate closely, in particular in the field of security, and represent an economic opportunity for the U.S., not a security risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;netherlands&quot;&gt;Netherlands&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-2&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dutch company ASML is the world’s sole supplier of the EUV lithography machines necessary to manufacture advanced semiconductor chips. As a result, the Netherlands occupies a key chokepoint in the AI chip value chain. Yet, for most of the 2010s, the Dutch government allowed these advanced semiconductor technologies to flow to China unimpeded. In 2019, the first Trump administration reportedly persuaded the Netherlands’s leadership to impose limited controls on cutting-edge EUV machines by showing them classified intelligence reports about the dangers that China’s acquisition of ASML’s technology posed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2020, the Dutch Ministry of Defense published an internal memo which concluded that continued exports of advanced semiconductor technologies would increase the chance of a NATO member state having to defend itself against advanced weapons systems in the future. This document highlighted the key role U.S. diplomacy played in Dutch strategic thinking around semiconductors, noting, “Our most important strategic security partner, the United States, has made an emphatic appeal to the Netherlands not to export EUV technology to China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This internal memo—along with continued discussions with the Trump and Biden administrations—prompted the Netherlands to announce that it would impose further license requirements for advanced SME in March 2023, bringing the government’s policies in line with the U.S. October 2022 controls as part of the reported trilateral deal between the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands. Furthermore, the Dutch government allegedly declined to renew ASML’s license to service and provide spare parts to its systems already in China. In September 2024, the Dutch government announced yet another update, this time on less advanced deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the September 2024 controls, Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Reinette Klever emphasized that the Netherlands’s leadership continues to view export controls on advanced SME as a significant national security priority: “I’ve made this decision for reasons of security. We see that technological advances have given rise to increased security risks associated with the export of this specific manufacturing equipment, especially in the current geopolitical context.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-netherlands-export-control-regime&quot;&gt;The Netherland’s Export Control Regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dutch export controls on dual-use items and technologies are grounded in two pieces of legislation: the 2008 Strategic Goods Decree and the 2011 Strategic Services Act. Articles 2 and 3 of the Strategic Goods Decree refer to Annex I of the EU Dual-Use Regulation rather than maintaining a Netherlands-specific list of dual-use items subject to export controls. Article 4 of the decree refers to Article 9 of the EU Dual-Use Regulation, which permits member states to impose license requirements on items not listed in Annex I for reasons related to public security or human rights. The Strategic Services Act adopts the EU provisions on services controls. License applications are processed by the Central Import and Export Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch export control system allows for the following kinds of controls on dual-use items and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Dual-use goods, software, and technology listed in Annex I of the EU Dual-Use Regulation or added by the Dutch government unilaterally are subject to license requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The Dutch government enforces end-use controls through the catch-all authorities provided by the EU Dual-Use Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; As an EU member state, the Netherlands implements services controls related to end-uses specified in the EU Dual-Use Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all EU member states, the Netherlands primarily controls dual-use items through Annex I of the EU Dual-Use Regulation. Similarly to a smaller subset of EU member states including Spain, France, Germany, and Italy, the Dutch government has made use of provisions in the EU Dual-Use Regulation (and its own legislation) that permit member states to implement controls outside of traditional multilateral agreements. As discussed in the previous section, the controls the Netherlands announced in March 2023 (and in September 2024, October 2024, and January 2025) were implemented on a unilateral basis. For example, the announcement accompanying the March 2023 export control updates specifically referenced the Article 9 provision of the EU Dual-Use Regulation which permits member states to “institute a ban on, or make the acquisition of a permit compulsory for exporting dual-use goods that are not specified in appendix I of the Regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the U.S. restrictions, the Netherlands’s controls do not specifically target China. In April 2023, then–Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Liesje Schreinemacher noted, “The Dutch export control policy is country-neutral. When assessing an export permit application, considerations are made and tested against the additional strategic character for export control on a case-by-case basis, where among others the properties of the product to be exported, the use of the product, the end-user and destination country are taken into account.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is increasing awareness in the Dutch policy community that China poses a significant danger. For example, in April 2023, the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service noted in its annual report that “[China] poses the greatest threat to the Netherlands’ economic security . . . [through] legitimate investments, company takeovers, and academic cooperation, as well as illegitimate digital espionage, insiders, covert investments and illegal exports.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-1&quot;&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 15, 2025, the Dutch government announced another export control update, due to enter into force on April 1, 2025, expanding the types of SME subject to license requirements. These additions are reflected in the annex to the Regulation on Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment and include items such as measurement and testing equipment, as well as optimization software used in the production of advanced semiconductors. In an announcement accompanying the update, Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Reinette Klever noted, “We are observing increased security risks associated with the uncontrolled export of this specific equipment. For this reason an export authorization will henceforth be required.” Consistent with previous controls, this measure did not specifically reference China. Nonetheless, this set of controls prompted an outcry from Beijing officials. The January 2025 controls followed unilateral measures announced in October 2024 that covered items related to quantum technologies, semiconductors, and additive manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands has also recently demonstrated a desire to build a more robust economic security tool kit. For example, in June 2023 the government announced it was considering legislation that would require foreign doctoral students coming to the country to study in technical fields to undergo a screening process. While the announcement did not specifically mention protecting EUV and DUV lithography, these technology areas are likely the target of the proposed measure. Prior to that, in May 2023, the Dutch government implemented measures subjecting certain investments, mergers, and acquisitions in its semiconductor industry to review based on national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;germany&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-3&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years, Germany believed that robust economic relations with China would achieve Wandel durch Handel, a German notion that roughly translates to “change through trade.” A central tenet in German foreign policy since the 1970s, the idea holds that trade with authoritarian regimes can induce political change. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s subsequent support of the war effort shook Germany’s confidence in the policy, as Germany’s extensive trade with both countries failed to prevent violent authoritarianism from spilling into Europe. In April 2022, the European Commissioner for Economy summed up the prevailing view in Europe when he stated that the “notion of Wandel durch Handel, of bringing about change through trade, has shown its limitations” and that Europe needed to “rethink [its] relations with autocratic regimes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, Germany’s Federal Foreign Office published its Strategy on China, further demonstrating an updated understanding of the Chinese threat. The document stated, “The Federal Government is committed to the adjustment of export control lists in international export control regimes as well as to reviewing national export control lists against the backdrop of new technological developments.” It further noted that the government was “also taking China’s Military-Civil Fusion policy into account in this regard.” Germany also pushed the European Commission to adopt an EU-wide investment screening mechanism to better protect member states’ economic security. This was widely seen as a response to the Chinese acquisition of German robotics national champion Kuka in 2016. In its 2024 annual report, Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution described China as Germany’s “biggest economic and scientific espionage threat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its increasingly wary rhetoric about the threat of China to its economic security, Germany has not kept pace with the United States, at least not in terms of export controls on advanced semiconductors and related equipment. In March 2024, Bloomberg reported that senior U.S. officials asked Germany to block shipments of optical components produced by Carl Zeiss, which are needed for advanced chip production and are used in ASML’s EUV machines, to China, but the German government was reluctant to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;germanys-export-control-regime&quot;&gt;Germany’s Export Control Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legal authorities for Germany’s modern export control regime come from the 2021 EU Dual-Use Regulation, as well as Germany’s Foreign Trade and Payments Act and Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance, both passed in 2013. Article 4 of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act gives the government authority to restrict foreign trade transactions in order to carry out EU controls or other member state obligations. It also stipulates that Germany can restrict exports unilaterally if doing so guarantees “essential security interests,” prevents “disturbances to German foreign relations,” or ensures the “public order or security” of Germany. The Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance states that goods listed in Annex I of the EU Dual-Use Regulation are subject to export controls. License applications for listed items are processed by the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (BAFA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German export control system allows for the following kinds of controls on dual-use items and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Dual-use goods, software, and technology listed in Annex I of the EU Dual-Use Regulation are subject to license requirements. Items found in Part I, Section B of the German Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance, often referred to as its national control list, are also subject to license requirements. Importantly, the national control list contains 20 dual-use items not included in multilateral agreements. In other words, it contains items Germany has put in place unilaterally. In theory, restrictions on these items apply to all countries, but German export control officials told CSIS that EU members and other allies are effectively exempt from these unilateral restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The German government enforces end-use controls through the catch-all authorities provided by the EU Dual-Use Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; As an EU member state, Germany implements services controls related to end-uses specified in the EU Dual-Use Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite U.S. pressure, Germany has not publicly implemented China-specific export controls on advanced semiconductors. In fact, German export control officials told CSIS that they view their export control system as in principle applying to all countries. They noted that for restrictions to apply on a country-specific basis, they have to be implemented through a sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-2&quot;&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 17, 2024, Germany used its Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance to unilaterally add a set of items related to semiconductor manufacturing, including equipment for wafer inspection and dry etching, to its national control list. German government officials told CSIS this measure was undertaken to align Germany with the existing U.S. export control regime, and that additional unilateral controls could arrive by mid-2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAFA has also undertaken a major effort to streamline its export control processing. In March 2024, the office announced its third tranche of policy changes in three years related to this effort. Sven Giegold, state secretary in the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, noted, “Procedural simplifications are contributing to significantly faster authorizations without compromising the scrutiny standards.” German export control officials told CSIS a fourth tranche went into effect in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japan&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-4&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2023, Japan announced plans to restrict exports of 23 types of advanced SME not controlled by multilateral agreements. This measure came after a reported deal earlier that year between Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States. However, Japanese officials insisted these controls were not targeted toward China. Japanese Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry Yasutoshi Nishimura stated in a March 2023 press conference following the announcement, “We do not have one particular country in mind with these measures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These controls underline the emerging consensus in Japan’s national security community that export controls and advanced semiconductor technologies play a significant role in securing Japan’s economic security. In 2021, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that the goal of its semiconductor industry was “to ensure Japan remains strategically essential and strategically independent amid the conflict for technological hegemony between the U.S. and China.” Meanwhile, Japan’s 2022 National Security Strategy recommended measures to “enhance investment screening and export control as well as response to forced technology transfer, and further advancing research integrity and measures against talent drain.” The 2023 Camp David pact, a trilateral agreement between Japan, South Korea, and the United States, demonstrated Japan’s desire to work more closely with the United States on economic security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the March 2023 controls, Japan remains a significant supplier of SME to China. For example, in the first three quarters of 2024, around 50 percent of Japan’s SME sales went to the country. As a result, over the past year, both the Biden administration and Congress called for Japan to further limit SME sales to China. In January 2025, Japan issued another export control update covering advanced semiconductor technologies, demonstrating the country’s continued willingness to implement controls on strategic technologies outside of multilateral export control regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-export-control-regime&quot;&gt;Japan’s Export Control Regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foundation of Japan’s present-day export control system dates back to 1987 in the aftermath of the Toshiba Machine incident. In 1987, the U.S. intelligence community discovered that the Japanese Toshiba Machine Company was providing the Soviet Union with nine-axis propeller milling machines and related software to support the Soviet submarine program, in clear violation of the COCOM regime. In response to pressure from the United States and allied countries, the Japanese government implemented significant changes to its export control regime including major amendments to the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act (FEFTA), first passed in 1949, and the creation of the Center for Information on Security Trade Control (CISTEC), a nongovernmental body dedicated to supporting Japan’s export control system and economic security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FEFTA remains the bedrock of Japan’s export control regime today and was the basis for its March 2023 and January 2025 controls on advanced semiconductor technologies. FEFTA contains two key provisions—Article 25 and Article 48—which provide the legal framework for its export control system. Article 25 states that the export of specific controlled technologies to a foreign person or country requires a license, and Article 48 states that the export of specific controlled goods requires a license. Japan enforces the following kinds of export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Items specified in Attachment List No. 1 of FEFTA are subject to license requirements. Items on this list are based on multilateral agreements like the Wassenaar Arrangement, Nuclear Suppliers Group, Australia Group, and Missile Technology Control Regime, or are added unilaterally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; METI maintains an end-user list that contains people and firms potentially involved in the development, production, manufacturing, or storage of WMDs. Japanese officials told CSIS that METI also plans to create a military end-user list focused on entities that pose a military end-use diversion risk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; METI requires exporters to obtain a license for any item that may “be used for the development, manufacture, use, or storage of WMD[s].”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; As a member of the four traditional multilateral export control regimes, Japan has the authority to implement services controls related to WMD end-uses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japanese export controls are largely grounded in multilateral regimes, Article 48 of FEFTA allows for unilateral action when the export of an item “is deemed to obstruct the maintenance of international peace and security.” The Japanese government specifically referenced these authorities when it announced its March 2023 controls on SME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within METI, three specific offices deal with export controls and are housed in the Trade and Economic Cooperation Bureau under the Trade Control Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these divisions, the Security Export Control Policy Division, administers export control policy and legislation and engages with international export control regimes. The second, the Security Export Licensing Division, is responsible for examining license applications and issuing licenses. The final division is the Security Export Control Administration Division containing the Security Export Inspection Office, which conducts company inspections and provides guidance for exporters, and the International Affairs Office, which engages with international export control regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-3&quot;&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2024, METI issued an interim report containing recommendations for significant changes to its export control regime. According to an English language overview of the document published by METI, the traditional framework for export controls is at a “turning point.” The report made the following four policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Review the complementary approach to the list control;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish a new dialogue framework on technology transfer between public and private sectors;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explore multilayered international collaboration for agile and effective export control;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Streamline and prioritize export control systems and implementations in accordance with the respective levels of security concerns, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, Japan imposed restrictions on several AI and semiconductor technologies to its control list. These included scanning-type electron microscopes and technologies used to design or manufacture gate-all-around field-effect transistor (GAAFET) structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these actions, U.S. lawmakers have continued to pressure Japan to increase restrictions on chip-making equipment destined for China. In October 2024, the ranking members of the House China Select Committee, Congressman John Moolenaar (R-MI) and Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), sent Japanese Ambassador to the United States Yamada Shigeo a letter requesting “urgent action to address the flow of Japanese semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) to the People’s Republic of China (PRC).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 17, 2025, METI announced its intention to add 21 items to its control list including previously uncontrolled advanced SME, further aligning its export control policy with the United States. This proposed measure prompted the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) to release a statement noting, “For some time, certain countries have generalized the concept of national security and abused export control measures to suppress China’s semiconductor industry. . . . China reserves the right to take necessary measures and will firmly safeguard its legitimate interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this criticism, the United States-Japan Joint Leaders’ Statement following the February 2025 meeting between President Trump and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba noted the two countries would resolve “to continue discussions on aligning policies to further promote and protect critical and sensitive technologies, including through export controls,” showing the country’s intention to continue export control coordination with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;south-korea&quot;&gt;South Korea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-5&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the twenty-first century, China was South Korea’s biggest trading partner. During this time, South Korean AI and semiconductor companies made significant investments in China. For example, SK Hynix and Samsung invested more than $20 billion to buy or build facilities in the Chinese cities of Dalian and Xi’an in 2020 and 2021, respectively. As recently as 2022, roughly 60 percent ($66 billion) of South Korea’s chip exports went to Chinese customers, though this includes companies such as Apple that do final assembly in China. South Korea is also the world’s largest supplier of memory chips and holds roughly half of global DRAM capacity, according to analysis by the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). That same analysis found that South Korea ranks third behind China and the United States in AI patent applications and granted patents. The country has also played an important role in AI diplomacy, hosting the AI Seoul Summit in May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its status as a global leader in strategic technologies, South Korea has been hesitant to implement strict export control measures due to its export-led economy and fear of retaliation from China. For example, South Korea originally refrained from joining the sanctions regime against Russia in 2014 after its illegal annexation of Crimea. However, South Korea aligned itself with international export controls and sanctions against Russia in March 2022, which many saw as a watershed moment for South Korea’s export control approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Camp David pact, a trilateral agreement between South Korea, Japan, and the United States, further committed South Korea to cooperation on technology and economic security issues. That same year, the United States overtook China as South Korea’s biggest export market. On September 10, 2024, Minister for Trade Dr. Inkyo Cheong stated, “Economic security requires more than unilateral action,” highlighting the government’s newfound openness to implementing export control outside of traditional multilateral frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, South Korea has yet to match its strategic thinking to concrete export control action, at least not to the same degree as the United States, Japan, or the Netherlands. In fact, the U.S. December 2024 export control update applied the FDPR to South Korean SME and high-bandwidth memory, as U.S. policymakers determined South Korea did not have “equivalent controls” for items specified in U.S. restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;south-koreas-export-control-regime&quot;&gt;South Korea’S Export Control Regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, the United States and South Korea signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the Protection of Strategic Commodities and Technical Data to bring South Korea in line with guidance prohibiting the export of COCOM-controlled items to communist-bloc destinations. South Korea’s current export control authorities for dual-use technologies are grounded in its Foreign Trade Act, originally passed in 1987. In 2007, the Foreign Trade Act underwent a significant revision, establishing the Korea Strategic Trade Institute (KOSTI), which supports the implementation of export controls. South Korea enforces the following kinds of export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Dual-use goods and technologies subject to license requirements are listed in Annexes 2 and 3 of South Korea’s Public Notice on Trade of Strategic Goods and Technologies. These annexes reflect control lists in multilateral agreements including the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Australia Group, and the Missile Technology Control Regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; South Korea also maintains a denial list, which includes people, companies, and institutions subject to restrictions based on UN Security Council sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; South Korea implements catch-all controls on items not included in multilateral control lists but which may be intended for use in the creation of WMDs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; As a member of the four traditional multilateral export control regimes, South Korea has the authority to implement services controls related to WMD end-uses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s export control system divides export control administration by item type across three bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy (MOTIE) oversees dual-use items.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) of the Ministry of National Defense (MND) oversees military items.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission (NSSC) oversees nuclear items.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, South Korean police arrested two former Samsung employees for attempting to steal trade secrets reportedly worth $3.2 billion on behalf of a Chinese chip manufacturer. Industrial espionage has proven to be a major issue for Korean AI and semiconductor firms. According to the South Korean government, “The majority of the [industrial espionage] incidents [in 2023] involved cutting-edge semiconductor technologies, an area in which South Korean firms are among the world leaders.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea has partly addressed this challenge through its national core technology list, authorized by the Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology. This act requires companies who work with one of the 76 listed technologies to adhere to stringent facility security requirements. Furthermore, if a company intends to export a listed technology, it must obtain approval from MOTIE. Any foreign investment (including mergers, acquisitions, or joint ventures) in a company that holds a listed technology is also subject to MOTIE review. The South Korean legislature significantly expanded the scope of the Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology in January 2023. The act was amended yet again in December 2024 to increase protections around national core technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-4&quot;&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 21, 2024, South Korea made several important changes to its export control laws by amending the Foreign Trade Act. First, South Korea renamed KOSTI to the Korea Trade Security Administration. While its English acronym KOSTI remains unchanged, the new Korean title reflects the agency’s expanded responsibilities including broader trade and technology security functions, and support for policymaking and industry analysis. Second, Article 19 of the Foreign Trade Act—which authorizes MOTIE to designate which goods require export licenses—added the phrase “or the equivalent multilateral export control cooperation” to the original text, which read, “in accordance with international export control regimes”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This revision was significant because previously the law only allowed compliance with control lists established by consensus among member countries of the four international export control regimes. With the revision, the Foreign Trade Act potentially allows for the addition of items that have not reached a consensus in traditional multilateral fora but are controlled by an ad hoc set of countries (such as the reported deal between Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States or a Wassenaar minus one arrangement). Despite these authorities, South Korea has not yet joined the Netherlands and Japan in imposing restrictions on advanced semiconductor technologies not controlled by multilateral regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwan&quot;&gt;Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-6&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan occupies a unique position in the semiconductor manufacturing landscape. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) produces over 90 percent of the world’s advanced semiconductor chips. Beyond TSMC, Nanya Technology Corporation (NTC), Winbond Electronics Corporation, and Macronix International are among the top 10 memory manufacturers in the world. MediaTek, ASE Group, and Unimicron also play important roles in other parts of the semiconductor supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semiconductor manufacturing industry is of such strategic importance to Taiwan’s national security, it is known as the huguo shenshan, which roughly translates to the “sacred mountain that protects the nation.” In 2021, Taiwan’s trade minister Wang Mei-hua stated, “This isn’t just about our economic safety. . . . It appears to be connected to our national security, too.” That same year, then–President of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen noted, “Our semiconductor industry is especially significant: a ‘silicon shield’ that allows Taiwan to protect itself and others from aggressive attempts by authoritarian regimes to disrupt global supply chains.” Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, made this point more bluntly in a 2022 interview on 60 Minutes, saying, “because our company provides a lot of chips to the world, maybe somebody will refrain from attacking [Taiwan].”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to manufacturing cutting-edge chips for U.S. chip design companies like Nvidia, TSMC was also the linchpin of the Chinese AI and advanced technologies ecosystem in the 2010s. For example, in 2019 Huawei’s first-generation Ascend 910A chip was manufactured by TSMC. This, at least in theory, changed in 2020 when the company officially halted its business with Huawei to comply with the first Trump administration’s export controls, causing Huawei to temporarily “exit whole lines of business,” such as its consumer smartphone operation. This action also had a significant impact on Huawei’s revenue, which dropped 23 percent between 2019 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, TSMC-manufactured products continue to find their way to Chinese firms in an apparent violation of U.S. export controls. In October 2024, an analysis by prominent semiconductor research firm TechInsights found that Huawei’s Ascend 910B chip contained TSMC-made components. In response, the U.S. Department of Commerce launched an investigation of the relationship between TSMC and Huawei. The U.S. Foundry Due Diligence Rule—which went into effect in January 2025 and imposed stricter restrictions on chip manufacturers—was widely understood as targeting TSMC and its illicit support of Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taiwans-export-control-regime&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s Export Control Regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s current export control regime for dual-use items is governed by Article 13 of its Foreign Trade Act, originally passed in 1993. This legislation establishes Taiwan’s export control program for strategic high-tech commodities (SHTC). The Foreign Trade Act allows for the following kinds of controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Taiwan enforces five separate dual-use export control lists:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;High-Tech Commodities List for Exportation to Russia and Belarus;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sensitive Commodities List for Exportation to North Korea;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sensitive Commodities List for Exportation to Iran;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Export Control List for Dual-Use Items and Technology (based on the EU Dual-Use Regulation); and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Common Military List (also based on the EU Dual-Use Regulation).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan also maintains a list of “restricted regions” subject to license requirements. These “regions” include Iran, Iraq, North Korea, China, Sudan, and Syria. China only qualifies as a restricted region for “12 categories of semiconductor wafer fabricating equipment for SHTC.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The Taiwanese International Trade Administration (TITA) maintains the Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List, which inventories people and companies subject to restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Taiwan implements “catch-all” controls on end-uses for which there is a risk of WMD proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TITA, housed within the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), is the principal government organization charged with implementing the country’s export control regime. However, TITA coordinates with the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Finance, and other agencies with subject-matter-specific mandates on export control enforcement matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan has also restricted the flow of sensitive AI and semiconductor technologies through economic security tools beyond export controls. In June 2022, Taiwan announced amendments to its National Security Act that created a national core technology list covering a wide range of SME including “manufacturing technology for chips (ICs) with processes of 14nm and below” and other packaging and chip security technologies. These amendments added increased protection for intellectual property related to listed technologies. In June 2022, the Taiwanese government also announced changes to the Cross-Strait Relations Act and the National Security Act that required employees of corporations and research institutions who work in national core technology areas or receive significant government funding to go through a strenuous review process to travel to China. Taiwan has also used its Trade Secrets Act to protect its semiconductor industry. For example, in May 2017, a former TSMC engineer who shared sensitive information with the Shanghai Huali Microelectronics Corporation was charged under the act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Taiwan has a robust and long-standing outbound investment screening process for transactions related to the production of advanced node semiconductors. For example, in 2002 MOEA issued the Operational Guidelines for Key Technology Review and Supervision of Investment in Foundry, Integrated Circuit Design, Integrated Circuit Packing, Integrated Circuit Testing, and LCD Panel Plants in Mainland China, which limit the ability of Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers to invest in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To incentivize Taiwanese semiconductor firms to remain in Taiwan, the country also amended Article 10-2 of the Statute for Industrial Innovation, informally known as Taiwan’s CHIPS Act, in March 2023 to provide tax credits to semiconductor companies to pursue research and development efforts in Taiwan. While this tax incentive scheme was not in and of itself new, the amendment to the statute tightened the eligibility requirement such that only semiconductor manufacturing firms were able to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-5&quot;&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the robust economic security measures Taiwan has implemented, a series of incidents over the past year demonstrated that Chinese firms continue to exploit loopholes in Taiwan’s export controls to gain access to sensitive semiconductor technologies. In October 2024, reporting in The Wire China found that TSMC was manufacturing chips for Chinese chip design company Xiamen Sophgo Technologies, which was then transferring chips to Huawei. A January 2025 teardown by TechInsights revealed that 5 nm chips in Huawei’s L540 series of laptops were manufactured by TSMC, further demonstrating TSMC’s far-from-perfect record of following U.S. export controls. Other gaps in Taiwan’s export control regime have also appeared. For example, an August 2024 report from the Taiwanese government-funded Research Institute for Democracy, Society and Emerging Technology (DSET) found that Chinese company Bitmain acquired access to controlled AI chips and related technology through a “remote poaching model.” In other words, Taiwanese engineers were teleworking for Bitmain. The study determined that Chinese company Bitmain leveraged Taiwanese engineers’ expertise, TSMC manufacturing, and ASE packaging to design and build controlled AI chips, without relocating any Taiwanese nationals to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china&quot;&gt;China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-7&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, China employed a variety of economic security tools against the United States including banning the export of certain critical minerals to the country, announcing an investigation into Nvidia on anti-trust grounds, and adding major U.S. defense companies to a Chinese equivalent of the U.S. Entity List. While these measures arrived in rapid succession, they were the product of more than five years of China’s export control and economic security capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic turning point for China’s domestic semiconductor strategy came in April 2018, following the comprehensive export controls the United States imposed on Chinese telecommunications company ZTE. These controls prompted a series of Chinese government actions designed to make China less vulnerable to future U.S. export controls and sanctions, which included an assessment of China’s most vulnerable technology chokepoints, the stockpiling of chips and chip-making equipment, and massive domestic semiconductor subsidies. While these were primarily defensive measures, China also laid the groundwork for more offensive economic security tools in this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2019, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary Xi Jinping called for the acceleration of “the construction of our country’s legal system for extraterritorial application” in a speech at the second meeting of the Central Committee for Comprehensive Law-Based Governance. A little more than a year later, at the seventh meeting of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, he stated, “We must tighten international production chains’ dependence on China, forming powerful countermeasures and deterrent capabilities based on artificially cutting off supply to foreigners.” China has passed a series of laws and regulations with these two goals in mind. These include the 2020 Regulation on Unreliable Entity List, the 2020 Export Control Law, the 2021 Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, and most recently the 2024 Regulation on Export Control of Dual-Use Items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-export-control-regime&quot;&gt;China’s Export Control Regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s modern export control regime can be traced back to the 1990s with the passage of the Foreign Trade Law in 1994, which focused on WMD proliferation. However, China’s export control system for dual-use technologies has undergone a significant reorganization in the last six months. On September 30, 2024, China announced its Regulation on Export Control of Dual-Use Items. Using authorities granted in China’s 2020 Export Control Law, this move consolidated previous rules and regulations, including&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the 2007 Regulation on Export Control of Nuclear Dual-Use Items and Related Technologies;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the 2002 Regulation on Export Control of Missiles and Missile-Related Items and Technologies; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the 2002 Regulation on Export Control of Dual-Use Biological Agents and Related Equipment and Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under this new regulation and previous laws, China has the following export control tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The Regulation on Export Control of Dual-Use Items created a unified control list combining items on lists such as the 2023 Catalogue of Dual-Use Items and Technologies Subject to Import and Export Licenses Administration, the 2017 Export Control List of Nuclear Dual-Use Items and Related Technologies, and the 2002 Export Control List of Missiles and Missile-Related Items and Technologies. Items on this unified list are subject to license requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The new regulation also introduced the Control List. Similar to the U.S. Entity List, the Control List comprises people and firms that are judged to pose some kind of national security risk and are thus subject to authorization requirements and other restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s 2020 Export Control Law provides a catch-all for any end-use that could endanger “[China’s] national security or national interests.” These terms are left largely undefined, providing MOFCOM with the ability to require licenses for a very broad set of unlisted items on an end-use basis if it desires.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s 2020 Export Control Law provides the authority to impose controls on services for any end-use that could endanger “[China’s] national security or national interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulation announced on September 30 also allows for controls based on the destination country of a given export. In fact, MOFCOM issued a blanket ban on the export of certain critical minerals to the United States two days after the new regulation went into effect. Furthermore, Article 49 of the new regulation gives China the ability to impose controls on foreign-produced items located outside China if they are a direct product of Chinese technology or software. According to a January 2025 report by the National Bureau of Asian Research, this authority is analogous to the U.S. FDPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOFCOM, in coordination with the Chinese Customs Bureau, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, is responsible for export control coordination and enforcement functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-6&quot;&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Regulation on Export Control of Dual-Use Items entered into force, China has put its new (and previously existing) authorities to work in what is widely seen as a response to recent U.S. AI and semiconductor export controls. On December 3, 2024, MOFCOM issued a notice banning the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and other critical minerals to the United States. The December 3 controls were particularly significant as they marked the first time China had imposed critical mineral export control on the United States on a country-wide basis. Two days later, MOFCOM followed these controls up by sanctioning U.S. defense contractors including General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and RTX’s Raytheon under its Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 2, 2025, MOFCOM continued its slew of restrictions against U.S. defense contractors, adding 28 companies to the Control List in order to “safeguard national security and interests,” including Anduril, Raytheon Missiles &amp;amp; Defense, and L3Harris. This action banned the export of any dual-use items to listed companies. That same day, MOFCOM placed an additional 10 companies on the Unreliable Entity List, preventing them from doing business in China and prohibiting their executives from entering or living in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same week as the U.S. December 2, 2024, export control update, the Anti-Monopoly Bureau of the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced it would investigate Nvidia for “suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.” More specifically, China’s competition regulator said it would revisit Nvidia’s 2020 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies. This is hardly surprising. China has a robust record of employing anti-trust measures in technology competition. A December 2022 analysis by the law firm Skadden finds that “of the thousands of deals that China has reviewed, only three (less than 0.01%) have been prohibited. . . . Nearly all of the prohibitions, conditional approvals, and abandonments over the past 10 years have occurred in the technology sectors that are important to China’s national growth, such as semiconductors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese officials have also indicated that further retaliatory measures are coming following the Biden administration’s AI Diffusion Framework and Foundry Due Diligence Rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-to-us-and-allied-policymakers&quot;&gt;Recommendations to U.S. and Allied Policymakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three elements, shown in Figure 1, that must be combined for the successful implementation of export controls: authority, capacity, and will. This paper focuses on the first of these elements, authority. However, capacity and will are also crucial to the success of U.S. and allied technology competition with China. Accordingly, the recommendations in this section address all three elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SkAiD32.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: The Three Elements of Effective Export Controls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, former U.S government officials have said that allied governments do “not really understand why the US Government is imposing its new China-specific controls,” and “do not see the national or common security justification of the controls.” Even if allied countries possessed the same export control authorities as the United States, they would also need to be convinced that using those authorities is in the best interests of their countries and international security. This clearly cannot be taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true of capacity. If an allied country has the political will and authority to unilaterally control advanced node semiconductors and related SME, ensuring compliance with the restrictions that it imposes would also require significant enforcement capacity. The United States invests considerably more resources into export control administration than allied countries, but even the United States faces significant concerns about enforcement capacity, particularly in the new administration. In fact, on February 5, 2025, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi signed a Department of Justice (DOJ) memorandum that disbanded the National Security Division’s Corporate Enforcement Unit, which was “created with the goal of investigating and prosecuting corporate actors involved in sanctions evasion, export control violations, and other national security-related economic crimes.” At the time of writing, the DOJ has not explained how any other part of the DOJ will perform this function or take over these critical responsibilities. Similarly, on March 2, 2025, the Treasury Department announced the suspension of the enforcement of the corporate transparency act which was “aimed at curbing the use of anonymous shell companies to conduct illegal financial activity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this report has detailed, U.S. allies have most or all of the legal authorities they would need to strengthen restrictions on export of technologies and services related to cutting-edge AI. To address the shortfall in political will, the key for the United States therefore is persuading these countries of the need for these controls and the viability of implementing them using their existing authorities. To address the shortfall in capacity, the U.S. government must persuade allies of the national security return on investment in effectively denying adversaries access to strategic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and allied policymakers should consider the following policy actions for more effective AI and semiconductor export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendation 1: Allied policymakers should restrict citizens’ support of advanced node semiconductor production in China using existing authorities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese semiconductor industry has been the beneficiary of technical assistance and consulting services provided by U.S. and allied individuals and corporations. For example, as noted in a previous CSIS paper, the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) 7 nm chip found in the Huawei Mate60 Pro was supported by significant foreign technical advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, BIS used the U.S. Persons Rule to impose controls on the activities of U.S. persons if they were in support of the development or production of advanced node semiconductors in China. This move restricted China’s access to technical assistance provided by U.S. citizens and companies. To address such assistance provided by the non-U.S. persons, U.S. allies should implement equivalent controls. Imposing such controls would not require legislative changes to the export control framework of most allied countries. For example, the European Union and its member states already have the authority to impose controls on services related to WMD end-uses and military applications. However, EU member states have not traditionally considered the development or production of advanced node semiconductors to fall under their existing WMD restrictions. But this is a political choice rather than a result of insufficient legal authorities. It is up to the Trump administration’s national security officials to make the case to allies that a different interpretation is in their best interests. There is a clear precedent for allies changing their tune when it comes to assessing the bounds of their own economic security tool kit. Allied government officials told CSIS that following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they used existing authorities to impose restriction on Moscow that they had previously thought would require new statutory authorities. In other words, they said they could not do something and then they did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendation 2: Allied policymakers should create China-specific restrictions for AI chips and related technologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2015, the U.S. Department of Commerce blocked Intel from selling its Xeon and Xeon Phi chips to four Chinese firms working on China’s Tianhe-2 supercomputer, which was being used for military research related to nuclear weapons. The logic was straightforward. As these firms were working on Chinese military projects, they were “acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” From this point forward, the Department of Commerce generally restricted U.S. firms from selling advanced node chips to customers working with the Chinese military. However, China’s policy of civil-military fusion meant that shell companies designed to help the Chinese military evade export controls were able to access advanced chips easily. A 2022 CSET study found that the majority of advanced chips procured by the Chinese military were designed by U.S. firms, despite U.S. restrictions on military end-users. The October 2022 control addressed this, at least in theory, by introducing a blanket prohibition on the export of AI chips to all of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the partial exception of Taiwan, U.S. allies do not have China-specific controls, or at least have not publicly stated that they have such controls. In the case of the Netherlands, their export controls on advanced SME are explicitly “country-neutral.” There are at least two good reasons that allies might pursue this approach. First, restrictions that apply on a China-wide basis mean that allied firms miss out on valuable revenue from sales to commercial firms in the Chinese market. For example, between 2016 and 2024, ASML saw growth in sales of equipment to China that exceeded growth in the rest of the world. Secondly, as demonstrated by the recent anti-trust action against Nvidia, there are legitimate concerns about Chinese retaliation against countries who implement controls perceived to target Beijing. However, there is no reason to believe allied controls will be any less susceptible to the kinds of evasive tactics that rendered the United States’ pre–October 2022 controls, which did not apply on a China-wide basis, ineffective. If allied countries are serious about restricting Chinese military end-users’ access to advanced node semiconductors and related technologies, they will have to do so on a China-wide basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendation 3: Allied policymakers should develop FDPR equivalents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant loophole in the pre–October 2022 controls was the fact that Chinese firms were accessing controlled SME, components, and spare parts from U.S. companies without a license via foreign-headquartered partners. The October 2022 controls addressed this in part through an expansion of FDPR, which prohibited foreign-headquartered firms from exporting SME made using U.S. technology to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States made these changes over two years ago, allies are still lagging behind. In fact, all allies surveyed in this paper lack meaningful equivalents to the FDPR, limiting the effectiveness of their restrictions on AI chips and related technologies. As previously mentioned, China added these capabilities to its export control tool kit in its new regulation. If allies must pass new legislation to create these capabilities, then they should do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendation 4: U.S. and allied policymakers should ensure penalties for export control violations are significant enough to deter violations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and allied semiconductor firms are among the most valuable in the world. For example, as of January 2025, TSMC had a market capitalization of $899 billion. Given their financial prospects, these companies have significant capacity to weather fines. As a result, there is increasing awareness in the policy community that more significant fines are needed to deter export control violations. In October 2024, Chris Miller, author of Chip War, noted that “governments—including the U.S. and Taiwan—need to couple stricter enforcement with larger financial penalties for violations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logic has also found increasing support in the U.S. government. In January 2024, then–Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew Axelrod described a $300 million fine on Seagate Technology Holding as a mere “down payment,” and highlighted the need for heightened penalties, saying, “You can expect to see more big-ticket corporate resolutions going forward.” While acknowledgment of the gap in deterrence is an important step, more concrete action is needed. Other companies have gotten off relatively lightly for export control violations, at least compared to the revenue and profits of the illicit sale. For example, on November 1, 2024, BIS imposed a $500,000 fine on GlobalFoundries for shipments of semiconductor wafers to SJ Semiconductor, a company on the BIS Entity List. This fine only amounted to around 3 percent of the value of GlobalFoundries’ shipment. Given semiconductor firms’ massive financial resources, U.S. and allied policymakers should also consider jail time or personal fines for the perpetrators rather than just corporate fines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendation 5: U.S. and allied policymakers should increase spending on export control processing and enforcement functions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the United States implemented its October 2022 export controls, the administration of the export licensing process and enforcement of controls has become significantly more difficult. BIS’s licensing workload has roughly doubled since 2012. Yet, the BIS budget for these activities has remained relatively flat in inflation-adjusted terms. Furthermore, BIS’s data analysis tools and other enabling digital technologies are inadequate for its broad set of responsibilities. In March 2024, in response to a question about whether BIS’s data analysis tools and infrastructure were sufficient, Alan Estevez, then–Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security, responded, “The answer to that is an emphatic no.” He went on to say BIS personnel are “relying on antiquated systems for both license adjudication and enforcement work that were put in service in 2006 and 2008, respectively.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, BIS must rely on private sector companies’ compliance programs and due diligence efforts. In fact, the majority of investment in export control compliance is in commercial firms, rather than BIS. But, as noted in a previous CSIS report, “The primary goals of U.S. companies are generally legal compliance and maximizing profits, not determining and advancing U.S. national security interests beyond what is stated in law and policy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though U.S. export license processing and enforcement capabilities are clearly not adequate for the task at hand, U.S. investment in these areas dwarfs that of its allies. For example, in fiscal year 2024, the United States allocated $222.4 million for BIS, almost twice the amount Germany plans to allocate to its export control office, BAFA, in fiscal year 2025. Export control administration and enforcement functions are at the forefront of technology competition with China. The United States and its allies must treat them as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the October 2022 export control update, then–Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave a speech in which he said, “We are at an inflection point. The post–Cold War world has come to an end, and there is an intense competition underway to shape what comes next. And at the heart of that competition is technology.” This reference to the Cold War was more than a rhetorical trick. Over the last four years, the United States has repeatedly used Cold War–era economic security tools against China, such as restricting commercially developed technologies via export controls. But there is also wisdom in how the U.S. national security community thought about the role of allies in technology competition during the Cold War period relevant to policymakers today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1955, the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, a now-defunct body created by President Eisenhower to coordinate economic policy across federal agencies, conducted a study titled “NATO, SEATO, and the Economic Defense Program.” This study recommended merging two nascent military and economic security organizations: NATO, the transatlantic military alliance, and COCOM, the export control coordination forum. The authors concluded that the “tie in of the organizations . . . will increase the mutual understanding of the overall security effort of the free world.” While this proposal was never implemented, the study contained a key insight relevant to the contemporary debate about restricting the flow of AI and advanced semiconductor technologies to China. The study notes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even in the U.S., with its tremendous economic, scientific, and technological power, there was an increasing awareness that we need allies as much as allies need us. . . . More and more we look to other areas of the free world for many of the raw materials needed to supply our industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is equally true for U.S. leadership in AI today. State-of-the-art semiconductors designed by U.S. firms rely on technical partners located in countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and Taiwan to be manufactured. As shown in this paper, U.S. efforts to limit China’s access to the most advanced AI technology also require allied cooperation to be successful. While certain countries have made steps in the right direction, the reality is that allied cooperation on export controls has been either too slow (in the case of Japan and the Netherlands) or largely absent (in the case of South Korea).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The America First Trade Policy released on the first day of Trump’s second term called for the “The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce . . . to identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls—especially those that enable the transfer of strategic goods, software, services, and technology to . . . strategic rivals and their proxies.” To achieve this goal and maintain the U.S. advantage in cutting-edge AI technology, the Trump administration will require both a thorough understanding of what export control authorities allied countries possess and the willingness to ask hard questions when it comes to their alignment with U.S. strategic goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week before reaching a deal, US President Donald Trump said he wanted $500 billion worth of Ukraine’s critical minerals as compensation for having supported the country following the full-scale invasion by Russia in February 2022. The offer, then rejected by Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky, was followed by threats to cut the country’s access to Starlink’s satellite communications system if it did not reach a deal. At the core of the US government’s pressure lays, among other things, its desire to diminish US dependency on the country that holds almost half of the world’s critical minerals reserves essential for tech development: China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 12 days following the inauguration of Trump’s second presidency, the administration announced a fresh set of 10% tariffs on imports from China—shortly thereafter increased by an extra 10%. China followed with a retaliatory set of measures including antitrust probes into US tech companies, 10-15% tariffs on farm products, coal, crude oil and farm equipment, and expansion of export controls on critical minerals that are essential in producing everything from smartphones to F-35s and solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s latest rush to secure critical minerals in Ukraine, a country that currently does not produce them (despite having them) and cannot ensure easy access to them during an ongoing war, raises the question of how ready they are to deal with pressures from their trade war with China – particularly in realms of high technology. How quickly and effectively can they respond to, and anticipate changes to critical supply chains feeding key sectors such as defence and technology? How effective have US economic deterrence measures been to stop Chinese tech?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-response-a-full-spectrum-digital-competitor&quot;&gt;China’s Response: A Full-Spectrum Digital Competitor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington is grappling with the fact that China has emerged as a full-spectrum digital competitor. It has a commanding position in the global manufacturing chain for digital goods and dominates the production and refinement of rare-earth materials and critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite attempts from the US to stop Chinese access to critical technologies in AI supply chains, both Chinese companies and the government have taken action to respond. DeepSeek’s R1 model release and low training cost has shown that China’s tech company ecosystem could become more quickly and effectively resilient to export controls than expected. After years of having Apple’s iOS and Android as the main operating systems in China, a homegrown one, Huawei’s HarmonyOS, is finally starting to capture a significant slice of the Chinese market, perhaps providing a basis for future internationalisation. Chinese companies have also sought to find other ways to secure access to high-end technologies, especially chips – either rushing to buy high-end chips prior to the enforcement of export controls and tariff or curbing restrictions to access NVIDIA-banned chips (A100 and H100) through a growing underground market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to even the recent past, the Chinese government is responding far more quickly and with more alacrity. Within days of US tariffs being announced by Trump, China swiftly announced expanded export controls on critical rare earths and minerals, and retaliatory tariffs on a range of US imports, including coal, oil and gas products, as well as large-engine cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore. Chinese regulators are taking targeted measures against US businesses as well: competition regulators have launched an investigation into Google’s Android operating system as well as into US chipmaker giant NVIDIA over violations of anti-monopoly laws, and are reportedly considering probing Apple’s App Store. Not only has China’s Ministry of Commerce added more companies to its Unreliable Entity List – a countersanctions tool established right after the US 2019 addition of Huawei to its own Entity List – but it is going beyond its previous, symbolic approach. Hitherto, all listed businesses were US defence companies with little or no business operations involving China anyway. Now, apparel conglomerate PVH and biotech company Illumina have been added to the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-limitations-of-us-economic-tech-deterrence&quot;&gt;The Limitations of US Economic Tech Deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions tend to have two potential objectives: denying certain capabilities to their targets and deterring them from certain conduct. US tech sanctions against China have, over the past few years, expanded from merely targeting companies such as Huawei and ZTE to covering the entirety of the country, and from a relatively limited range of high-end semiconductors to an ever broader scope that by now has come to encompass sales and distribution channels, as well as equipment manufacturers in a range of third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether those sanctions will achieve their primary goal, of putting a hard ceiling on Chinese semiconductor development and thereby the country’s ability to progress in cutting-edge applications such as AI, is subject to vociferous debate. Huawei has been able to advance the development of its mobile phone chips in the absence of access to advanced manufacturing facilities and equipment, albeit more slowly and at greater cost. Despite the labelling of DeepSeek’s R1 as a national security risk and OpenAI’s reference to it having been trained by “distillation” practices, China has since mounted a nationwide push for adoption across local governments, public services and even private companies such as Tencent – which have deployed DeepSeek as part of the famous WeChat app. International companies are adopting the technology too: DeepSeek’s AI models are now available through Amazon Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any demonstration of competence from Chinese firms or government authorities often meets with the response that they must have been cheating one way or another, whether by stealing intellectual property, bending international trade rules or, in this case, smuggling semiconductors. There is, of course, justification for those assertions, but at the same time, both the determination of Chinese policymakers and the growing ability of scientists, researchers, engineers and businesspeople to succeed should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Biden and Trump administrations have pursued a policy of economic deterrence using different tools in the toolbox such as sanctions, export controls, tariffs, among others. To the extent that these tools are meant to deny, reroute, and contain Chinese tech prominence, the results are still quite limited. They seem even to have been counterproductive, in the sense that they have galvanized an ecosystem of Chinese businesses to finally come on board with policy initiatives to indigenize high-end technology capabilities. The emergence of DeepSeek is one illustration of this, as well as of another trend that merits attention: the constraints that China faces, including a relative shortage of funds and the aforementioned technology sanctions. These incentivise developers to explore alternative technological paths that, at least in the case of DeepSeek, have led to a product that is closely comparable to its American counterparts, but far more efficient in terms of inference and training costs. As seen in this case, constraints can enable efficiency and innovation in model training as much as disable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the policy level, technological progress is a key element of government’s policy, both to realise its development objectives at home, as to better compete and defend itself on the global stage against a United States that Beijing (not wholly unjustified) perceives to be fundamentally opposed to its attaining near-peer status. Attempts to deter China from those objectives will probably strengthen resolve to achieve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-domestic-challenges&quot;&gt;US domestic challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, US decision makers must also start considering the growing ramifications of sanctions against China on their domestic politics, as their cost will increasingly start hitting home. TikTok provides an illustrative example: it is one of the most popular apps among the US population, a significant part of which is less concerned about great power politics. Spotting a political opportunity with that broader part of the US population, Donald Trump provided the company with a stay of execution, delaying the application of the law mandating its divestiture or ban for 75 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But TikTok is far from the only dossier with a domestic impact. Both Biden and Trump administration have sought to boost domestic AI supply chain production in the US to diminish reliance on China and other countries by boosting and relocating fabs domestically – but strategies have so far been incremental and with mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former president Biden’s CHIPS Act sought to address Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing chokepoint by encouraging TSMC to relocate to Phoenix, Arizona, but has fallen short of its promises. Firstly, production costs will remain at least 50% higher when fabs open following substantial delays. Secondly, the lack of US workforce skills for chip manufacturing can endanger the pace and sustainability of TSMC US. Thirdly, in seeking to onshore to lower the risks of a semiconductor supply chain crisis in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the US also lowered the strategic protection that market concentration provides to Taiwan – as any small disruption to TSMC as a result of a China-driven blockade, for example, could be catastrophic for the global economy, including for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestic chipmaking industry returns on investment will take longer than expected and there is a risk that Trump’s volatile policymaking can further slow the pace of AI supply chain economic growth and robustness. While, on the one hand, Trump recently announced Stargate – a $100 billion private joint venture led by OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and others – to build AI infrastructure in Texas, on the other he has threatened to end the CHIPS Act after a massive onshoring effort of TSMC – who relies on the North American market for 70% of the revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contradictory policies come at a time where the US might not be able to afford miscalculations in the AI competition. In 2022, the US represented less than 1% of the global fabrication capacity in advanced logic chip manufacturing. Even though there is an expectation of it growing up to 28% by 2032, the prospects look tricky. US chipmaker Intel Corp has been struggling to maintain its side of the bargain to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing after a drop in revenue in the fourth quarter and the abrupt departure of its CEO in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CTGxgou.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Trump’s overreliance on tariffs is a short-lived strategy that could further exacerbate the inflation and cost-of-living issues that did much to bring him back to the White House in the first place. Following tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, it is expected that the average middle class US household annual costs could rise anywhere from $2,500 to $3,900—something that is arguably not “America first”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the use of tariffs as a political tool since Trump’s first presidency has reflected on the fall China’s total share of total US imports – making it more prepared to endure additional tariffs and readapt supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, tariffs will continue to create disincentives for global supply chains and increase prices of goods in the U.S. Given that consumer electronics amount for 27% of China exports, the US will still be selective and potentially reluctant to target that sector. Moreover, as mentioned, diversification of imports away from China does not mean less exposure to Chinese industries. Since the early days of the trade war, in 2018, Chinese manufacturers have moved production lines to Vietnam – a country that has been largely benefitting from the rerouting of US imports – showing that derisking goes beyond reduction of direct reliance but also includes indirect reliance through other trading partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-road-ahead&quot;&gt;The road ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Trump’s hawkish approach to China persists, it might backfire or lose steam, if not backed by a well-calibrated assessment of the consequences domestically and internationally. In his previous administration, US pressure on EU member states concerning China led the bloc to name the country as a “systemic rival” back in 2019. Threats to impose tariffs on EU goods, and the US decision to initiate “peace talks” with Russia, have been far from well-received in Brussels. The regional bloc does not have a unified position on China, with some, such as Spain, favouring a pragmatic approach: “Europe must make its own decisions, and on its own. And we have to decide when China can be a partner and when China is a competitor”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the key problem of the US deterrence strategy against China’s emergence as a tech power is that it is maximalist, and therefore unattainable. It includes objectives such as preventing harmful uses of technologies, but also capping China’s further economic growth potential. As China itself faces a critical juncture in its development path, it will double down on technological innovation as an engine for future prosperity. It may be difficult for people who spent their entire careers in the post-Cold War environment to accept, but it seems the notion of US primacy in the technological field is impossible to sustain. The practical point here is that economic deterrence is not a silver bullet nor a sustainable long-term strategy domestically or internationally if not followed by other actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, Washington must accept the existence of China as a near-peer power. Isolating it can only increase its independence form US-linked tech supply chains (or move towards indirect dependence) and stimulate China to work towards a more effective strategy with Global South countries as done in infrastructure development through the Belt and Road Initiative, for example. As argued by Australia’s former cyber and tech Ambassador, if China “redefines cost structures by offering AI at a fraction of Western subscription costs” then DeepSeek and the likes will disrupt AI business models and market expectations. In other words, the goal of US technology policy should not be to deny technology wholesale, but to recognise that technology will be diffused anyway, calibrate long-term economic deterrence expectations, and to collaborate in curbing harmful uses of some of these technologies – especially the average consumer-facing AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

This report outlines how the United States and its partners can confront China’s dual-use shipyards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s shipbuilding sector has undergone a striking metamorphosis. Twenty years ago, the country was a peripheral player in the global shipyard business. Today, it dominates the industry. At the heart of this transformation is the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), the world’s biggest shipbuilding group. The firm built more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than the entire U.S. shipbuilding industry has built since the end of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSSC’s reach extends beyond powering global commerce. It is also the driving force behind China’s bid for a “world-class navy” that is increasingly capable of projecting power farther from China’s shores. Over the past two decades, CSSC has churned out advanced warships at an alarming clip, upgrading the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) from a modest coastal force into a regional juggernaut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating under the firm grip of China’s top political leadership, CSSC has become a poster child of Beijing’s “military-civil fusion” (MCF, 军民融合) strategy, which seeks to eliminate barriers between the country’s commercial and defense sectors. Driven by this initiative, CSSC has deliberately blurred the lines between its commercial and military shipbuilding operations, leveraging its extensive commercial network to support China’s naval modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much attention has been paid to how MCF has helped upgrade China’s military, there has been considerably less focus on the ways that companies located outside of China are supporting its defense industrial ecosystem. China’s deliberately opaque dual-use shipbuilding network makes it hard for foreign companies to gauge how their ship orders, technology transfer, and other activities ultimately bolster China’s military development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report demystifies the intricacies of China’s shipbuilding ecosystem, offering U.S. policymakers, business leaders, and other stakeholders a clearer perspective on the strategic challenges it poses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-tiered-risk-system-assessing-the-dual-use-threat&quot;&gt;The Tiered Risk System: Assessing the Dual-Use Threat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This CSIS report explores the close ties between commercial and military shipbuilding in China, focusing in particular on the role that foreign firms are inadvertently playing in facilitating the expansion and modernization of the PLAN. Utilizing data accessed through intelligence platforms S&amp;amp;P Global and Datenna, as well as satellite imagery and other open-source materials, this study categorizes each of the 307 Chinese shipyards active from 2019 to 2024 into four tiers that reflect their degree of integration with the country’s military industrial ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tier 1 (Very High Risk): CSSC-owned shipyards known to produce warships for China’s navy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tier 2 (High Risk): CSSC-owned shipyards that build commercial ships but maintain close ties to military projects, personnel, and state funding mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tier 3 (Moderate Risk): Shipyards owned by other state firms besides CSSC, which can be mobilized to support national security needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tier 4 (Lower Risk): Private or foreign-owned shipyards that have limited documented military involvement but are subject to China’s regulatory and political control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tiered categorization clarifies how commercial shipbuilding is distributed across China. While all Chinese shipyards operate under state directives, those in higher tiers demonstrate closer ties to the country’s military and national security apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WXSIYwC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Tiered Breakdown of China’s Shipbuilding Industry, 2019–2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis reveals that a disproportionate share of China’s commercial shipbuilding occurs at shipyards that are closely intertwined with the country’s sprawling defense industrial base. Tier-1 and Tier-2 yards represent just 15 percent of active shipyards in China but produce a striking 40 percent of its total commercial output by tonnage. Private shipyards, although far more numerous, combine for just 36 percent of the country’s commercial production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign buyers are responsible for the vast majority of shipbuilding production across China’s industry, but especially at Tier-1 and Tier-2 yards. Over 75 percent of the production at these shipyards was destined for firms based outside of China or Hong Kong. This includes U.S. military allies like Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, and South Korea, as well as other partners like Qatar, Singapore, Switzerland, and—most strikingly—Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By purchasing vessels from these yards, foreign firms have funneled billions of dollars of revenue into entities that are central to China’s naval modernization. Given the substantial overlap in material inputs, production techniques, personnel, and infrastructure required for both commercial and military shipbuilding, commercial revenues effectively subsidize China’s naval expansion. By offsetting fixed costs, these earnings enable Chinese shipyards to scale military production more efficiently and at lower marginal expense. Even when military and commercial production is not co-located, the shared ownership structures between many of the leading commercial and military shipyards enables assets and processes to be easily transferred across the civil-military divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign firms have also provided China’s defense contractors with key dual-use shipbuilding technology through joint ventures, licensing agreements, and direct purchases. These transfers have been essential to enabling the PLAN to overcome important technical hurdles in areas like marine propulsion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China’s key naval shipbuilders continue to benefit from access to financial markets in the United States and its allies. Foreign capital flows, including from U.S. institutional investors, help fund CSSC and its subsidiaries despite their central role in China’s military industrial ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-risks-and-global-implications&quot;&gt;Strategic Risks and Global Implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s growing dominance in global shipbuilding presents critical economic and national security challenges for the United States and its allies. The country’s rapid naval expansion, enabled by its dual-use shipbuilding model, is closing the gap with U.S. naval forces. The PLAN now fields more warships than the U.S. Navy and is on track to deploy a 425-ship fleet by 2030, sustained by an industrial base capable of replacing and repairing vessels far faster than U.S. yards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economically, China’s industrial policies are marginalizing U.S. and allied shipbuilding industries. Japan and South Korea, once dominant, are losing market share, even in advanced sectors like liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker production. European shipbuilders also face growing competition as China expands into high-value markets like cruise ships. The U.S. commercial shipbuilding sector has been nearly eliminated, with its market share falling to just 0.11 percent of the global total in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bmerPy3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The erosion of U.S. and allied shipbuilding capabilities poses an urgent threat to military readiness, reduces economic opportunities, and contributes to China’s global power-projection ambitions. Addressing these disparities is essential not only for military deterrence but also for maintaining economic and strategic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time to act is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s naval buildup and its commercial shipbuilding dominance are not distinct challenges. Policy measures to address these threats must simultaneously factor in both the economic and security dimensions. Policymakers must balance both short-term responses and long-term strategy, addressing immediate security concerns while anticipating the broader implications of China’s expanding military-industrial reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, Washington needs to take actions—along with its partners and allies—to level the playing field and disrupt China’s murky dual-use ecosystem. In the long term, the United States needs to invest in expanding shipbuilding capacity outside of China by rebuilding U.S. industry and by leveraging the existing strengths of key like-minded nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report offers concrete policy recommendations to achieve these objectives. They are summarized below, with more detailed recommendations located at the end of the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impose scalable docking fees on global shipping companies operating Chinese-built vessels. Work is already underway in Washington to devise a scheme to impose docking fees on Chinese-made vessels when they call at port in the United States. The authors recommend tailoring those fees so that they impose higher costs on purchasing ships from the most concerning shipyards, such as Tier-1 and Tier-2 shipyards. Taking a weighted approach would allow for more effectively targeting China’s shipbuilding ecosystem to achieve not just economic objectives but also national security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sever remaining U.S. financial and business ties with CSSC and its subsidiaries. The U.S. government has already blacklisted CSSC, but there are still loose ends to tie up. Tightening financial restrictions would better prevent U.S. capital and technology from supporting China’s naval expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monitor Chinese shipyards and remain flexible in enforcing actions. China’s shipbuilding ecosystem is opaque, and private firms can be co-opted for military purposes. Some shipyards may shift production strategies to bypass measures, necessitating a flexible enforcement approach. Ongoing industry and intelligence assessments will help ensure U.S. measures remain effective.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use targeted diplomacy to encourage other countries to limit ties with China’s dual-use shipyards. Many non-U.S. companies rely on Chinese shipbuilding, making global coordination crucial. Targeted measures—rather than blanket bans—will make it easier to secure allies’ buy-in. Diplomatic efforts should emphasize the shared risks of supporting shipyards tied to China’s military ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make targeted investments in long-term shipbuilding capacity in the United States. Docking fees and other measures can help raise funds to reinvest into U.S. shipbuilding capacity. Policymakers should maintain realistic expectations for the short term, but targeted investments can help set the foundation to build a minimum shipbuilding capacity needed to meet national security and strategic requirements. Strengthening domestic capacity will also create high-skilled jobs and bolster national security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attract foreign investments into the U.S. shipbuilding industry. Washington should encourage and incentivize key global players—especially South Korea and Japan—to invest in U.S. shipbuilders. Policymakers should also look for investments from European companies that are global leaders in high-tech areas of the shipbuilding industry. As Washington courts investments, it should offer reciprocal investments in other areas as an incentive and strengthen economic and security ties with key partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coordinate with partners to build additional shipbuilding capacity outside of China. Given U.S. constraints, reducing China’s dominance in global markets will require friendshoring. Shipyards in Japan, South Korea, and Europe can be strengthened through coordinated investment and policy incentives. Prioritizing emerging technologies—such as clean energy vessels—may provide opportunities to compete with China more effectively in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-strategic-approach-to-shipbuilding&quot;&gt;China’s Strategic Approach to Shipbuilding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generations of Chinese leaders have prioritized shipbuilding as a foundational pillar of economic and military power. The industry has benefited from decades of state support and industrial policy, initially focused on spurring economic development and modernization. As China’s geopolitical environment has evolved, however, the strategic and security dimensions of shipbuilding have come to the fore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Xi Jinping’s ascent to power in 2012, Beijing has accelerated efforts to transform China into a “strong maritime power” (海洋强国). This concept encompasses not only naval power but also economic influence, scientific discovery, and technological innovation in the maritime domain. Under Xi, the shipbuilding sector has been directed decisively toward serving national objectives, producing a fundamental shift in the global market in favor of Chinese shipbuilders—many of which play a key role in China’s defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-civil-fusion&quot;&gt;Military-Civil Fusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meteoric rise of China’s commercial shipbuilding industry is closely tied to the relentless pace of its military modernization. Rather than establishing firewalls between civilian and military production, China has actively sought to integrate these activities. This aligns with China’s military-civil fusion (MCF, 军民融合) strategy, a national strategy elevated and spearheaded by Xi Jinping to fuse together the country’s national security and economic development policies to simultaneously level up the defense industry and broader economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maximizing the overlap between commercial and military production through MCF provides a key channel for the exchange of resources, technology, and personnel between sectors. China’s 13th Five-Year Plan for the Development of Strategic Emerging Industries highlights “military-civilian common standardization projects [that] promote two-way transfer of military-civilian technology.” The prominent role of sprawling state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in strategic industries further facilitates this process, as it consolidates commercial operations, research and development, and military production under direct government control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, shipbuilding has emerged as a poster child of MCF in action. Policies such as the 2015 Technical Standards for New Civilian Ships to Implement National Defense Requirements intentionally blur the lines between military and civilian production by requiring civilian vessels built for China’s commercial fleet to conform to military specifications. In 2017, Xi established the Central Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development and elevated MCF to a national strategy. At the commission’s opening plenary session, he called for the country “to make military-civilian integration better and faster,” and sea power topped the list of priority areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Beijing’s MCF ambitions in shipbuilding lies the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), an expansive conglomerate of shipyards, factories, and research institutes overseen by China’s top political and military leadership. CSSC is the world’s largest shipbuilding group, and in 2024 alone, it produced more commercial vessels by tonnage than the United States has since World War II. Yet, the company is also responsible for building warships for the ever-expanding People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), which is rapidly amassing the world’s largest fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China State Shipbuilding Corporation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;is the world’s largest shipbuilding conglomerate by both revenue and market share. It boasts 84 subsidiaries and employs over 200,000 people across shipbuilding, marine engineering, research and development, and various other portfolios. The firm calls itself the “main force” in developing China’s naval forces, and “undertakes the scientific research and production tasks of all the main combat equipment of the Chinese Navy.” Similar to U.S. firms like Boeing or Lockheed Martin, it is a major defense contractor with significant commercial operations. However, CSSC has fewer lines separating its commercial and military operations, creating inherent risks for companies seeking to do business without inadvertently contributing to China’s military development. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed 25 CSSC subsidiaries on its Entity List, restricting the transfer U.S. technology to those entities. In 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury added the company to its Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List, restricting certain financial transactions with the firm.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior executives at China’s leading shipbuilders have openly embraced the push to integrate commercial and military production. In 2017, Hu Wenming, then-chairman of CSSC, described Xi’s MCF drive as a “mobilization order” to accelerate fusing the civilian and military sectors. Hu Keyi, chief engineer at CSSC’s Jiangnan Shipyard and a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, urged the industry to “focus on the transfer of civilian technology to military technology, especially the transfer of shipyard civil shipbuilding methods.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“At present, we should focus on the transfer of civilian technology to military technology, especially the transfer of civilian ship construction methods in shipyards.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;hu-keyi-chief-engineer-of-jiangnan-shipyard&quot;&gt;Hu Keyi, chief engineer of Jiangnan Shipyard&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MCF offers China’s commercial shipbuilders a significant competitive advantage in global markets. The shipbuilding industry is prone to volatile boom-and-bust cycles driven by shifts in international trade flows. After the 2007–08 global financial crisis, for instance, many shipyards worldwide faced severe downturns and closures. During such rough patches, Chinese shipyards benefited from counter-cyclical investments through naval contracts. This practice continues today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a direct comparison between commercial and military vessels is difficult due to their differing labor and material requirements, one reliable estimate suggests that a single aircraft carrier can generate as much work for a shipyard as 10 bulk carriers or supertankers. In fact, the difference may be even more stark. Unofficial estimates put the cost of China’s third aircraft carrier a roughly $6–$8 billion compared to the $130–$140 million price tag for a new supertanker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This steady demand has enabled Chinese shipyards to maintain high capacity levels, allowing them to ramp up production quickly when commercial markets rebound—unlike many of their foreign competitors, which are often forced to downsize or exit the industry entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PMMGRW8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Integrated Civilian and Military Production Visible at Changxing Island Shipbuilding Base and Longxue Island Shipbuilding Base&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it ranks among the world’s leading defense contractors, CSSC generates a uniquely large share of its revenue from civilian production (see Figure 1). In 2023, just 23 percent of CSSC’s revenue came from defense, well below the global average of 56 percent for major defense firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Boeing, one of the world’s leading commercial aircraft manufacturers, depends on defense for over 40 percent of its revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Boeing, which largely separates its defense and commercial business units, CSSC can readily redirect its commercial revenue toward bolstering naval production. In 2016, an entity within CSSC transferred the assets of one of its most prolific commercial shipyards, Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding Heavy Industry, to Wuchang Shipbuilding, another subsidiary shipyard that builds warships, particularly submarines, for the PLAN. A spokesperson for the company stated that “the integration (of Qingdao and Wuchang) will have complementary advantages. The new shipyard will be capable of producing not only military ships, including the next-generation frigates and amphibious warfare ships, but a wide range of commercial ships.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MCF in shipbuilding has been further accelerated by state-driven consolidation efforts. In 2019, Beijing orchestrated a merger between CSSC and its largest domestic rival, the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC), which had been separated since 1999. The merger placed the two giants’ dual-use shipyards, as well as nearly 100 subsidiaries and research institutes, under one corporate umbrella. This has helped further streamline financing, technology sharing, and personnel transfers across civilian and military lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At major shipbuilding hubs—such as Changxing Island in Shanghai, Longxue in Guangzhou, and facilities in Dalian—commercial and naval production lines have been increasingly co-located, further reducing barriers between merchant and military shipbuilding across China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that state-directed consolidation, coupled with the prioritization of military demands, can stifle competition and impede transparency. This has facilitated systemic corruption in China, exemplified by the high-profile fall from grace of former CSSC Chairman Hu Wenming. In 2023, Hu was sentenced to 13 years in prison for his role in a graft scandal in which the state alleged he received $8.4 million of personal kickbacks. Hu’s conviction followed a 12-year sentencing of another shipbuilding executive, Sun Bo, who was imprisoned several years earlier for accepting millions of yuan worth of bribes during his tenure. Such corruption inflates costs and can slow technological progress as resources are diverted toward personal gain or politically directed projects rather than market-driven innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, Beijing’s continued promotion of MCF reflects the leadership’s confidence in the approach. Xi Jinping’s ongoing, far-reaching anti-corruption campaign, which targets top figures in the military and defense industrial base, suggests that Xi and the Chinese Communist Party are confident they can combat corruption while still driving forward MCF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beijings-policy-push&quot;&gt;Beijing’s Policy Push&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s emergence as a global shipbuilding powerhouse gained momentum in the early 2000s, driven by major policy shifts. Recognizing that the rapid growth of containerized maritime trade would be a boon for global shipbuilders, Beijing began developing ambitious plans to position Chinese firms at the forefront of the industry. In 2002, Zhu Rongji, China’s premier and chief economic architect at the time, visited the headquarters of CSSC, where he declared that China would seek “to become the largest shipbuilding country . . . by 2015.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following year, the State Council published the Outline for the Maritime Economy Development, which laid the groundwork for three major shipbuilding industrial clusters in Bohai, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. These regions remain the powerhouses of the country’s shipbuilding output today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bR14k1k.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: Selected Chinese Shipbuilding Policies, 2000–2020.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2003, China has issued at least 25 national-level plans involving the shipbuilding sector. Each successive Five-Year Plan, widely regarded as the government’s principal economic blueprint, has included directives to bolster shipbuilding. China’s influential Made in China 2025 plan also designated shipbuilding as a strategic priority. An array of lower-level sectoral guidance and implementation documents published by various ministries and party organs sets specific development benchmarks and outlines policy support measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This surge in policy attention has translated into a wellspring of financial and regulatory support for China’s shipbuilders. Recent academic estimates suggest that between 2006 and 2013, government subsidies for shipbuilding totaled $91 billion, accounting for a startling 46 percent of the industry’s total revenue during that period. These measures directly increased China’s global market share by an estimated 42 percent, predominately at the expense of shipbuilders in South Korea and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct state support continued through the 2010s, even as the global shipbuilding market suffered a significant downturn following the 2007–08 global financial crisis. Research by CSIS estimates that from 2010 to 2018, China’s government provided at least $132 billion to the shipbuilding and shipping industries, predominantly through preferential financing from state banks. Massive subsidies funneled into China’s steel industry helped artificially suppress the cost of steel plates, a critical input that accounts for as much as a quarter of shipbuilding costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshaping-market-forces&quot;&gt;Reshaping Market Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, China’s ability to leverage its massive scale and industrial capacity to manipulate global markets fundamentally reshaped the shipbuilding industry. Having produced less than 5 percent of the world’s tonnage in 2000, Chinese shipyards today account for more than half of total commercial production. Formerly dominant Japanese and South Korean shipbuilders have experienced declining production since 2011 as shippers from around the world place more orders with Chinese yards to upgrade their fleets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/I8fA8K0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shifts began at the turn of the twenty-first century, when policy signals from China’s central government kicked off a surge of entrants into the industry. Between 2000 and 2010, hundreds of new shipyards sprung up across China, attracted by booming global demand and generous government subsidies. Data from S&amp;amp;P reveals that the decade saw the number of active shipyards in China explode from 46 to 296. Production rose even more dramatically, with annual output jumping by over 3,700 percent during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This frenetic production quickly outpaced global demand, leading to substantial overcapacity worldwide. The influx of low-cost Chinese vessels drove down prices and eroded industry profits, forcing many competitors to scale back or exit the market. Japan and South Korea, both industry leaders in 2000, saw their share of global shipbuilding output rapidly fall as Chinese shipyards clamored to ramp up operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/paANBKB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Share of Global Commercial Shipbuilding Production, 2000–2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global financial crisis of 2007–08 proved to be another massive shock to the industry. As global trade faltered and demand for new shipping vessels fell, orderbooks in shipyards worldwide dried up. Global shipbuilding production peaked in 2011 before falling dramatically as order backlogs cleared out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China’s budding industry, this sudden collapse in demand was an existential challenge. Production in the country was dispersed across hundreds of small, inefficient shipyards that had few tools to weather the crisis, making them highly vulnerable to unexpected demand shocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent the industry’s collapse, China’s State Council imposed a moratorium on new shipbuilding firms and launched a series of measures to spur consolidation. Preference was given to larger shipyards that could benefit from economies of scale and more efficiently allocate central funding. Most notably, the government channeled resources to companies included on a “White List” of handpicked shipyards. Initially comprising 51 (mostly state-owned) companies in 2014, the list grew to 70 by 2019. These yards received directives to increase investment and production, even though global demand remained sluggish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surviving shipyards were, on average, larger, more efficient, and more likely to be backed by the state. They were also more globally competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/T2CxY1q.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Chinese Shipyards by Number and Output, 2000–2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consolidation efforts culminated in the 2019 merger of CSSC and CSIC, creating by far the largest shipbuilding group in the world. The new behemoth oversaw $120 billion of assets after its merger, dwarfing the $33 billion owned by its main rival, South Korean builder Hyundai Heavy Industries, which had just executed its own merger with a major domestic competitor. Hyundai Heavy’s chief executive at the time remarked that the industry was “consolidating to survive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of these policies, authorities also began to push shipyards to expand into higher-end segments of the shipbuilding market such as LNG tankers, cruise ships, chemical carriers, and roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) car-carrying vessels. These more complex vessels had historically been dominated by technologically superior South Korean, Japanese, and European shipyards. Their higher profit margins contrast with the relatively simple bulk carriers that formed the lion’s share of China’s early output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, China’s use of state-driven industrial policy to stabilize its industry, reduce overcapacity, consolidate production, and ascend the value chain was often a blunt force that created significant waste and inefficiency. Yet when measured against the strategic goal of wresting market share from global leaders, it has proven ruthlessly effective. Other major industrial powers such as Japan, South Korea, and the United States have also provided significant government support and protection to their own shipbuilders but still have failed to keep pace with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s hold over the global shipbuilding market is poised to deepen over the next decade. As of January 2025, it held roughly 62 percent of the global orderbook for merchant vessels through 2033. This includes over 80 percent of orders for new containerships and 30 percent of orders for LNG carriers. If these trends continue, a substantial majority of the world’s merchant fleet put to sea in the coming years will be built in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-rise-of-the-plan&quot;&gt;The Rise of the PLAN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China’s commercial shipbuilding industry was racing past its rivals, the country was also undertaking a breakneck expansion and modernization of its naval forces. In just 30 years, the PLAN has evolved from a modest regional force into the world’s largest navy by number of vessels, surpassing even the U.S. Navy. As of 2022, the PLAN operated a battle force fleet of 351 ships, compared to the U.S. Navy’s 294.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace of naval shipbuilding at China’s key shipyards has been astounding. The growing shipbuilding base at Shanghai’s Changxing Island alone has churned out not just large cruisers and destroyers but even bigger vessels. The expansive facilities there are nearly finished constructing China’s third aircraft carrier as well as the first of an all-new class of drone-carrying amphibious assault ships—the largest of its kind in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the north, the storied Dalian Shipyard refitted and built China’s first two aircraft carriers, along with several other surface combatants, and the nearby Bohai Shipyard has produced a growing fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. All of these—and other warship builders—are owned by the state-owned defense giant CSSC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QfM35eD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new assets have transformed the PLAN into a veritable “blue water navy” capable of projecting power farther from China’s shores. Chinese naval doctrine is evolving accordingly. The country’s 2019 defense white paper asserted that it was “speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas,” reflecting an expanding vision of power projection toward a globally capable force. In its 2024 report about China’s military power, the U.S. Department of Defense assessed that China’s naval modernization efforts are aligned “with [its] growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands for the PLAN to operate at greater distances from mainland China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QWErpn0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 8: PLAN Fleet Composition.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: O’Rourke, China Naval Modernization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s naval buildup is part of a much broader military modernization project. In the medium and long term, Chinese leaders have set their sights on “basically complet[ing] national defense and military modernization by 2035” and possessing a “world-class military by mid-century.” Achieving these goals would both afford Beijing much greater military capability to achieve its broader ambition of pushing the United States farther from China’s periphery and strengthen China’s hand with respect to key contested issues like control over Taiwan and the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;demystifying-chinas-dual-use-shipbuilding-network&quot;&gt;Demystifying China’s Dual-Use Shipbuilding Network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the global shipbuilding industry becomes increasingly dependent on China’s shipyards, it is essential to scrutinize how these commercial relationships fuel the rapid expansion of the Chinese navy. The integration between China’s commercial shipyards and its military industrial complex is deliberately opaque, with political elites and business leaders often masking the extent of these connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some shipyards openly engage in both naval and commercial production, others maintain ambiguous or indirect ties to military entities, and still others appear to have no defense involvement at all. This deliberate lack of transparency complicates efforts to fully assess the national security implications of China’s dominance in global shipbuilding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify this risk landscape, CSIS compiled a comprehensive dataset of 307 Chinese shipyards active between 2019 and 2024. Drawing from data accessed through two intelligence platforms, S&amp;amp;P Global and Datenna, as well as open-source Chinese-language material, this study classifies each Chinese shipyard into one of four tiers based on its level of integration with the country’s defense industrial base and broader national security enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mJv0Ml5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3: Tiered Categorization System.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIER 1: KNOWN NAVAL CONTRACTORS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tier includes 12 CSSC-owned shipyards that are responsible for constructing virtually all of China’s modern naval fleet. However, several are also commercial shipbuilding powerhouses. While there are only a dozen Tier-1 shipyards in China, representing a small fraction of the hundreds of shipyards spread across the country, they produce over 17 percent of China’s annual commercial output by tonnage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of activity at some of these shipyards is mind boggling, with their production lines rapidly churning out some of the largest and most advanced merchant hulls in the world. On average, the vessels produced at these shipyards are nearly twice as large as those constructed elsewhere in the country, underscoring their outsized importance in China’s shipbuilding industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to their foundational role in China’s naval modernization, Tier-1 shipyards receive substantial state funding and contracts, ensuring a steady stream of resources to fuel rapid production. These dual-use facilities blur the line between commercial and military activity, leveraging their infrastructure and output to accelerate naval production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lion’s share of Tier-1 shipyard production occurs at just four shipbuilding epicenters: Dalian, Guangzhou, Jiangnan, and Hudong-Zhonghua (the latter two of which are now co-located on Changxing Island). These shipyards rank among the most prolific in the world, excelling in both naval and commercial production. Between 2019 and 2023, these four facilities launched at least 39 warships, totaling over 550,000 tons of displacement—equivalent to a fleet larger than the United Kingdom’s entire Royal Navy. Among these vessels are some of the largest and most sophisticated in the PLAN’s arsenal. During the same period, these shipyards also produced an astounding 19 million gross tons (GT) of commercial vessels, a figure that rivals the annual output of South Korea, the world’s second-largest shipbuilding nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/O7F42cd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 9: Average Ship Size (GT).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dual-focus production model underscores the immense capacity and versatility of Tier-1 shipyards, where commercial and naval production occur in tandem. The opaque nature of these operations allows these shipyards to attract foreign clients who inadvertently pour billions of dollars into commercial ship orders that are often constructed alongside advanced surface combatants for the PLAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2019 and 2024, upwards of 72 percent of the commercial output of Tier-1 shipyards was destined for foreign buyers. Top purchasers included firms from Singapore, a critical U.S. defense partner in the Indo-Pacific, and Switzerland, a U.S. treaty ally, which together accounted for 34 percent of Tier-1 exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ANqe82A.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 10: PLAN Warships Built Alongside Merchant Vessels at Tier-1 Shipyards (See Appendix for Additional Imagery)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s position as a top client of China’s naval shipyards is particularly striking, given the direct threat the PLAN’s rapid expansion poses to the island’s security. Evergreen Marine Corporation, one of the world’s largest shipping companies and a cornerstone of Taiwan’s economy, has invested heavily in expanding and upgrading its container fleet. Many of these orders have gone to Tier-1 shipyards like Hudong-Zhonghua and Jiangnan—the same facilities producing warships explicitly designed to support the PLAN in conducting amphibious assaults or other military operations across the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cQsCJNt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS calculations reveal that fully 15 percent of Evergreen’s current active fleet was built at Tier-1 shipyards, with more on order. The symbolism of Evergreen’s distinctive green hulls built just beside the PLAN’s Fujian aircraft carrier—named for the province from which China would launch an invasion of Taiwan—is eye-catching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even two U.S.-based companies, Pangaea Logistics Solutions and Seabulk Fleet Management, acquired six hulls from these shipyards during the period investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that these companies, and many others that buy vessels from China, are simply responding to market incentives. Thanks in part to subsidies and other state support, China’s shipyards are often able to deliver high-quality vessels faster and at lower costs than competitors, making them a preferred supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, governments should balance the potential benefits of cost savings with the risk of contributing to China’s naval development. Many of these firms are based in economies that have signaled concern over China’s rapid military modernization and assertive foreign policy, like Taiwan or Japan, creating a misalignment of market incentives and strategic interests. Even for countries like Greece or Switzerland, which are home to major global shipping firms and face little immediate threat from China’s military expansion, Beijing’s track record of coercive behavior should raise eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIER 2: CSSC COMMERCIAL SHIPYARDS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category comprises shipyards fully or partially owned by CSSC but not clearly identifiable as producers of warships. There are 23 shipyards in Tier 2. Among them are some of China’s most productive commercial shipbuilders, including Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding and Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding HI. Together, Tier-2 shipyards account for approximately 24 percent of China’s annual commercial ship production by tonnage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While CSIS found no direct evidence of naval production at these facilities, they remain strategically significant due to their ties to CSSC. These shipyards may still provide dual-use technologies, build components or modules, and transfer personnel or expertise to Tier-1 yards. They also benefit from CSSC’s access to state financing and industrial policy support, raising questions about their indirect contributions to China’s naval modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite not building naval vessels directly, Tier-2 shipyards are structurally tied to China’s defense industrial base through their affiliation with CSSC. For example, the Shanghai Waigaoqiao shipyard openly acknowledges on its website that it has undertaken research projects for military entities such as the State Administration for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (formerly the Commission for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense) and CSIC. This dual-use potential, combined with access to state resources, underscores the latent risks associated with Tier-2 shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, Tier-2 shipyards are co-located with Tier-1 yards, further complicating the distinction among CSSC entities. For example, two major Tier-2 shipbuilders, Shanghai Jiangnan Changxing Shipbuilding and Shanghai Jiangnan Changxing Heavy Industry, are located alongside the Tier-1 Jiangnan Shipyard and Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard on the massive Changxing Island Shipbuilding Base in Shanghai. Similarly, in the country’s south, several Tier-2 yards are based within the Longxue Shipbuilding Base in Guangzhou, home to naval shipbuilders Guangzhou International Shipbuilding and Huangpu Wenchong Changzhou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tier-2 shipyards have also swept up billions of dollars in contracts from foreign buyers seeking to upgrade their commercial fleets, despite their physical proximity and organizational integration with China’s naval industrial base. These close ties have done little to deter international clients, who purchased over three-quarters of the total production at Tier-2 shipyards—the highest share among all four tiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top customers have included major shipping companies from France and Singapore, as well as other shipping heavyweights, such as Germany and Greece. This strong international demand highlights the global reliance on these facilities, even as their strategic ties to China’s defense industry raises critical security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIER 3: OTHER STATE-OWNED SHIPYARDS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipyards in this tier are fully or partially owned by state-owned enterprises other than CSSC, such as COSCO and China Merchants Group, or by provincial governments like Jiangsu or Fujian. They may play supporting roles in supporting MCF by supplying equipment or materials, but their primary portfolios center on commercial production. Although not directly linked to China’s military industrial ecosystem, they remain important conduits for state-led economic and technological initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 41 active Tier-3 shipyards account for approximately 23 percent of China’s commercial ship production. However, the average size of vessels built in Tier-3 shipyards is significantly smaller than those produced in Tier-1 and Tier-2 facilities. This disparity highlights the comparatively smaller scale and limited capabilities of Tier-3 yards, especially when contrasted with the massive CSSC shipyards, which are capable of constructing vessels exceeding 200,000 GT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tier-3 shipyards generally represent a lower—but not absent—risk of integration with China’s military production ecosystem compared with Tier-1 and Tier-2 yards. State ownership means that these companies are directly managed by central government authorities through the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC). SASAC’s primary responsibility is ensuring that state capital is channeled according to national strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yHk58Q9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it chose to, Beijing would have considerable latitude to leverage the capacity and assets of any state-owned shipyards for military or broader security purposes. For example, in a wartime scenario, Chinese authorities would face few obstacles to mobilizing these shipyards to build, repair, or service its naval forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, at present, Tier-3 yards are physically and organizationally detached from military production, meaning Beijing cannot as easily leverage their capacity for dual-use purposes. The lack of necessary infrastructure, cleared personnel, and security requirements at these shipyards could raise the costs of tasking them with sensitive military projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GOlx5Mh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 6: Top Buyers from Tier-3 Shipyards, 2019–2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign buyers represent a considerably lower share of production at Tier-3 shipyards than their counterparts in Tiers 1 and 2, with 58 percent of production at these yards being ordered by overseas firms. Notably, Japan is a leading foreign buyer of vessels built in Tier-3 shipyards, despite having its own strong domestic shipbuilding industry. This underscores the difficulty Japanese shipyards face in competing with lower-cost ships built by Chinese state-owned entities, compounded by capacity limitations within Japan’s own domestic industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIER 4: PRIVATE OR FOREIGN-OWNED SHIPYARDS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These yards are majority-owned by private Chinese companies or by corporations headquartered outside mainland China or Hong Kong. They primarily focus on commercial shipbuilding and generally have limited or no direct involvement in defense-related activities. Informal or indirect ties to China’s military industrial ecosystem remain possible through joint ventures, component sourcing and procurement, or technology transfers, but are far less robust than at higher tiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tier-4 shipyards comprise the largest group of Chinese shipbuilders by both number and share of production. These 210 privately-owned yards together account for 36 percent of China’s annual commercial production. Many are small firms focused on niche sectors of the market, like refrigerated cargo carriers and passenger ships. Yet, several are highly prolific, boasting sophisticated operations that rival or even surpass the production of CSSC’s largest shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ySBAMFE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 7: Top Buyers from Tier-4 Shipyards, 2019–2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two largest Tier-4 shipyards, New Times Shipbuilding Co. and Jiangsu New Yangzi Shipbuilding, rank first and third, respectively, in production among all Chinese shipyards. Together, these two behemoths account for 15 percent of China’s total production. Both firms are investing millions of dollars into expanding capacity to keep pace with demand, including in state-of-the-art shipbuilding production technologies, such as smart manufacturing and energy efficient construction techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jiangsu New Yangzi Shipbuilding is one of the few major Tier-4 shipyards owned by a company listed outside of China. The yard is owned by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group, a Singapore-listed enterprise that also controls two other Chinese shipyards, Jiangsu Yangzi Xinfu Shipbuilding and Jiangsu Yangzi-Mitsui Shipbuilding. Other foreign owners of Tier-4 shipyards include major Asian manufacturers, including South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries and Japan’s Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While large, foreign-owned shipyards have a degree of separation from the Chinese government, private ownership alone should not shield these yards from scrutiny. Ultimately, private Chinese companies are still subject to state regulations and oversight, including laws that mandate cooperation with national security objectives when requested. Private companies are also often under the state’s indirect influence through partial ownership by the central or local governments, and many firms have internal party committees, which allow the Chinese Communist Party to influence corporate decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one infamous example of risk at Tier-4 shipyards, the privately owned Fujian Yihe shipyard was named in a 2021 UN Security Council report for violating international sanctions by helping to obscure the identity of a ship after it engaged in illicit trade with North Korean vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Tier-4 yards openly promote their ties to Chinese entities involved in military activities. Jiangsu Huatai Shipbuilding Co., for example, claims to have established technical cooperation partnerships with several CSSC research institutes known to support military projects. Another private yard, Jianglong Shipbuilding Co., reports that it builds vessels for quasi-military Chinese entities like the Chinese Coast Guard and the Ministry of Public Security. These cases reflect the fluidity of China’s shipbuilding ecosystem and underscore the need for greater transparency into how private shipyards interact with the country’s sprawling security state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign buyers account for nearly 70 percent of the production at Tier-4 yards (see t. Notably, the two largest private shipyards mentioned above—New Times Shipbuilding and Jiangsu New Yangzi Shipbuilding—were responsible for nearly half (46 percent) of the output contracted by foreign buyers among all Tier-4 shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;KEY TAKEAWAYS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings reveal key insights about China’s shipbuilding industry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privately owned yards dominate in numbers, but not capacity.&lt;/strong&gt; While 74 percent of the 307 surveyed shipyards are privately owned, production capacity is heavily dominated by state-backed enterprises. The 81 shipyards in Tiers 1, 2, and 3 collectively account for more than 64 percent of commercial output by tonnage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry consolidation drives output.&lt;/strong&gt; Half of China’s total shipbuilding output since 2019 has come from just 10 shipyards. New Times Shipbuilding, China’s top-producing privately owned yard, produced more tonnage than all of Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand combined. Still, only three of China’s top 10 shipbuilders are privately owned, while 5 are CSSC subsidiaries—including 3 Tier-1 yards that also construct warships for the PLAN.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overseas buyers dominate demand.&lt;/strong&gt; Foreign companies headquartered outside China or Hong Kong accounted for nearly 70 percent of the commercial tonnage built in China between 2019 and 2024. Major buyers included countries such as Singapore, Greece, Switzerland, and Japan, home to leading global shipping companies with increasing demand for large oceangoing vessels. However, these nations are also key U.S. partners that have voiced concerns over China’s military expansion and its potential impact on Indo-Pacific stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;foreign-entanglements&quot;&gt;Foreign Entanglements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast size and growing sophistication of China’s shipbuilding industry has provided it with tremendous market power. It is now nearly impossible for competitive international companies looking to purchase vessels or sell subcomponents to avoid China’s market. Firms from around the world have flocked to the country, building up close relationships with Chinese shipyards, including by signing shipbuilding contracts worth billions of dollars and transferring critical technology and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this close embrace has been lucrative for major multinational companies, it has also directly benefited China’s naval development. By providing capital and technology to China’s dual-use shipyards, foreign firms have helped to subsidize the country’s naval industrial buildup and allowed the PLAN to overcome important technological hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the specific ways that foreign capital and technology have diffused across the civil-military divide to support China’s naval shipbuilding capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foreign-ship-orders&quot;&gt;Foreign Ship Orders&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously noted, foreign companies headquartered outside of China and Hong Kong account for roughly 70 percent of commercial tonnage produced in Chinese shipyards. Detailed financial information about these transactions is rarely made public, making it difficult to calculate the total revenue generated from these sales. However, sporadic public announcements reveal that China’s major shipyards regularly win contracts with overseas buyers reaching billions of dollars in value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the largest deals have flowed to Tier-1 shipyards owned and operated by CSSC. In 2024, for example, Hudong-Zhonghua signed a world-record contract worth nearly $6 billion with QatarEnergy to build 18 LNG carriers by 2031. The previous year, France’s CMA CGM signed a deal worth nearly $3 billion with CSSC to build 16 dual-fuel container ships in what was then the largest single shipbuilding order at Chinese shipyards. The vessels are set to be built at Jiangnan, Dalian, and Hudong-Zhonghua—all Tier-1 dual-purpose yards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those deals are just two prominent cases of a much wider challenge. Data analyzed by CSIS shows that, in total, between 2019 and 2024 foreign firms purchased 304 hulls from Tier-1 shipyards alone, collectively bringing in tens of billions of dollars in revenue and pushing China’s naval yards further into the forefront of the global commercial shipbuilding market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/budZUT0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image22&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to annual announcements by China’s national shipbuilding industry association, the country’s commercial ship exports have pulled in a combined $165 billion between 2019 and 2024 (see Figure 13). While no publicly available information specifies how much of this revenue went into CSSC’s coffers, a conservative estimate based on the company’s share of China’s total production (roughly 40 percent) suggests it made at least $66 billion from ship exports over that period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XGIFI8y.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 14: Major Expansion Underway at Changxing Island Shipbuilding Base and Longxue Island Shipbuilding Base (See Appendix for Additional Imagery)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSSC’s high share of revenue from commercial operations means that these funds likely help absorb much of the fixed costs at its shipyards, including maintenance, infrastructure, R&amp;amp;D, and logistics costs. At shipyards where commercial and naval production is co-located, as is the case at many of CSSC’s most productive yards, this likely indirectly reduces the per-unit costs for military vessels, making China’s naval production more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSSC’s public filings and other financial documents provide few details on how the profits from these sales are allocated; however, major expansion projects underway across CSSC’s main shipyards suggest that the company is spending heavily to boost its long-term capacity and efficiency. In Shanghai, builders have nearly completed a $2.6 billion project to relocate the Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard to the sprawling Changxing Island Shipbuilding Base, alongside the recently expanded Jiangnan shipyard. The facilities will cover 7.7 kilometers end-to-end and encompass an area twice the size of midtown Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar investments are underway in CSSC’s yards in southern China, where the company is spending $2.3 billion to expand the Longxue Shipbuilding Base in Guangzhou. Once complete, the colossal facility is expected to have the capacity to produce 10 million deadweight tons each year—equating to roughly two-thirds of Japan’s entire shipbuilding output in 2023. Chinese state media has proudly touted the effort in Guangzhou as helping “to build a military-civilian integrated marine science and technology industrial city” (军民融合海洋科技产业城). In recent months, the Guangzhou shipyard has been the center of a flurry of concerning construction activity, including an experimental large drone carrier, an unmanned combat surface vessel, a new set of special barges likely designed for amphibious landings, and a novel sail-less submarine or large unmanned underwater vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revenue provided by CSSC’s commercial shipbuilding contracts with foreign firms will likely continue to be key to offsetting some of the massive costs of upgrading and expanding China’s naval forces. The U.S. Navy estimates that China is seeking to build a modern battle force fleet of 425 ships by 2030, an unprecedented procurement effort that will cost hundreds of billions of dollars to build and maintain. In the face of slowing growth and considerable economic headwinds that may constrain China’s budgetary environment, maintaining its access to revenues and financing from foreign sources will be critical for the PLAN to keep pace with its ambitious modernization goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technology-transfer&quot;&gt;Technology Transfer&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business ties are just one of the ways that foreign firms have facilitated the rise of China’s naval industrial base. Perhaps just as importantly, global companies across the shipbuilding supply chain have helped supply China with world-class technology and expertise that has found its way into PLAN warships and production lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many of the world’s most advanced industries, shipbuilding has a highly complex and globalized production ecosystem. Modern vessels require intricate design and construction processes and are made up of thousands of components, including specialized engines and propellors, navigation and control systems, integrated electronics, and radar modules, among many others. Many of the advanced construction techniques, design software, and critical subcomponents used to build complex commercial vessels are also applicable to the production of warships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r5BX7dw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 10: Selected Technology Transfers from Foreign Companies to China’s Shipbuilding Industry.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has capitalized on the dual-use nature of these technologies to circumvent rules put in place by many countries to restrict the export of defense-related equipment. Companies like CSSC have leveraged their commercial success to gain access to foreign technology through licensing agreements and joint ventures. Despite clear evidence that Chinese firms have used these technologies for military development, overseas companies—often based in the United States or allied countries—have proven to be willing partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gaztransport &amp;amp; Technigaz SA (GTT)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;is a leading multinational marine engineering firm headquartered in France. The company specializes in designing and building membrane containment systems, which are critical for the transport and storage of LNG. The firm has signed several significant technology-sharing agreements with CSSC, including a 2023 strategic partnership that “provides for cooperation between GTT and twelve subsidiaries of the CSSC conglomerate.” Among these are three of the largest Tier-1 shipyards in China, Hudong-Zhonghua, Jiangnan, and Dalian, which are explicitly authorized to build GTT technologies under a special arrangement known as a technical assistance and license agreement. Notably, GTT also has contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense to build fuel storage facilities in the United States.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues are perhaps best on display in China’s pursuit of advanced propulsion technologies, namely marine diesel engines and naval gas turbines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MARINE ENGINES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s shipbuilders have historically struggled to develop domestically produced marine engines on par with those built by their European counterparts. The PLAN has long preferred to outfit many of its warships with imported engines, even with the added risk associated with relying on foreign suppliers for key defense platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these engines have been supplied by two European firms, German-based MTU and the former French firm SEMT Pielstick (now part of Germany’s MAN Diesel &amp;amp; Turbo). Starting in the early 2000s, these companies began licensing their high-performance diesel engines for manufacture within China. According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), between 2001 and 2022, no less than 528 MTU and SEMT-Pielstick engines were built under license in China and supplied to China’s rapidly growing navy. This included some of the PLAN’s most important and lethal platforms, including Type 055 cruisers, Type 052D destroyers, Type 054/A frigates, and Type 039 diesel-electric attack submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iwmL2tF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image25&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 15: French and German Marine Engine Exports to China, 2001–2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers&quot;&gt;“SIPRI Arms Transfers Database,” Stockholm International Peace Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their end use in Chinese naval systems, MTU and SEMT Pielstick engines were permitted for export to China under German and EU law due to their status as dual-use technologies. In 2013, a spokesman for Man Diesel &amp;amp; Turbo explained that the arrangements were legal because “none of these engines is specifically designed for military purposes. There is a broad variety of civil applications for these engines, too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GAS TURBINES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gas turbines are another critical component in high-performance propulsion systems, particularly for large surface combatants. China’s earliest turbine-equipped warships relied on technology provided by the U.S.-based firm General Electric beginning in 1985. Following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, however, the United States placed restrictions on exports of sensitive military technology to China, including gas turbines. In response, China turned to a Ukrainian supplier, Zorya-Mashproekt, which in 1993 agreed to license its UGT-25000 gas turbines to China and transfer full technical documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China reverse engineered the technology, and by 2004, CSIC subsidiary Longjiang GH Gas Turbine (GHGT) introduced a domestically produced variant named the GT-25000 (also known as QC-280). The power and efficiency enabled by GT-25000 turbines was key to China’s ability to develop many of its modern surface combatants, including the Type 055 cruiser and Type 052D destroyer. Still, China’s initial GT-25000 turbines remained reliant on advanced cooling blades and other components sourced from overseas, leaving China vulnerable to export restrictions and supply chain disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSSC and its subsidiaries have persistently worked to reduce their reliance on foreign technology, including by tapping commercial markets. In 2011, CSSC’s 703rd Research Institute, a subsidiary focused on gas turbine development, made targeted investments in Wuxi Yongda, a Chinese manufacturing company. Wuxi Yongda had recently signed a joint venture with a leading UK firm specializing in advanced alloy casting technology needed to build turbine cooling blades. The 703rd Research Institute’s investment was likely intended to gain access to the technology to improve its own naval turbine design and production process. State media cheered the venture as “a typical case of the defense industry achieving military-civilian integration through mixed ownership reform.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts like these have paid off for China’s military shipbuilders and the PLAN. In the 2018 edition of its annual report on China’s military power, the U.S. Department of Defense assessed for the first time that China had reached near-total self-sufficiency in naval gas turbine technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This success, however, has not slowed China’s pursuit of cutting-edge gas turbine technology from overseas. In 2019, GHGT inked a licensing agreement with Japanese firm Mitsubishi Power to produce its H-25 series compact gas turbines in northern China. These advanced turbines are designed to be capable of running on green fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia—a capability that China has sought to integrate across its shipbuilding industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, in 2023, GHGT was nearly successful in an attempted purchase of the gas turbine division of Germany’s MAN Energy Solutions, which was set to shutter operations. The sale was initially approved, but Berlin moved to block the transaction in July 2024 due to concerns that the technology would be used to support China’s naval development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foreign-capital-markets&quot;&gt;Foreign Capital Markets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from direct revenue flows and technology transfer, CSSC has gained access to foreign capital markets through its listing on various stock markets under a subsidiary, CSSC Holdings Ltd. As of March 2025 CSSC Holdings Ltd. remained accessible to investors in the U.S. through major China ETFs held by leading institutional investors like Blackrock and Vanguard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in spite of CSSC’s inclusion on a list of firms tied to China’s military that then-president Donald Trump blacklisted from U.S. investments through a 2020 executive order. CSSC is also included on the U.S. Treasury Department’s Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List (CMIC), which is aimed at curtailing U.S. entities from engaging in transactions involving publicly traded securities of listed firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source reporting also suggests that China’s naval shipbuilders have raised billions on global stock and bond markets. Between 2004 and 2015, publicly listed arms of CSSC and CSIC raised a combined total of $22.3 billion from selling stock and bonds on global markets, including on the foreign investor–friendly Hong Kong Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, CSIC successfully raised at least $1 billion in capital from a bond issued on its behalf by a Cayman Islands–based firm called Poseidon Finance 1 Ltd. This bond was available to American investors, who may have contributed significant funding to its sale. These transactions may have helped CSSC and CSIC fund large naval shipbuilding and shipbuilding expansion projects, including the construction of the Shandong, China’s first domestically produced aircraft carrier launched at Dalian shipyard in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the continued structural consolidation underway within CSSC’s labyrinth of subsidiaries, holding companies, and research institutes, it will likely continue to grow easier for Chinese authorities to direct the transfer of privately raised capital between sub-entities of the company to meet strategic requirements. In September 2024, CSSC announced that it was undertaking an internal restructuring to bring CSIC’s financial holdings fully under CSSC, placing all of the companies’ expansive assets under the control of one mega-entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;national-security-and-economic-implications&quot;&gt;National Security and Economic Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s increasingly dominant position in global shipbuilding presents significant challenges for the economic and national security of the United States and its allies. As now-U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said at CSIS in 2024, “The industry is really decimated over time here in the United States, but it’s not as though it shifted to a friend of the United States. . . . It shifted to our greatest adversary.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as emerging technologies like drones and artificial intelligence change the character of warfare, the ability to build ships at scale remains a core facet of military power. This is particularly true in a largely maritime theater like the Pacific, where U.S.-China competition is most acute. China’s breakneck naval buildup—enabled in large part through the success of its commercial shipbuilding industry—is rapidly shifting the balance of power in Asia and undermining the ability of the United States and its allies to check Beijing’s growing assertiveness in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-security-concerns&quot;&gt;National Security Concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rapidly modernizing navy has emerged as a major area of concern for U.S. military planners. The PLAN has already overtaken the U.S. Navy by hull count, and it is rapidly closing the gap in qualitative measures like fleet tonnage and vertical launch system (VLS) missile cells. A comparison of net tonnage shows that the PLAN has shrunk its tonnage gap with the U.S. Navy from roughly 4 million tons in 2010 to under 1.6 million tons today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has similarly managed to rapidly reduce the disparity in VLS cells deployed on its surface combatants, reaching half the number boasted by the U.S. Navy in 2024—up from just a quarter in 2019. Compounding these concerns, the overwhelming majority of China’s naval forces are concentrated close to home in the Indo-Pacific, whereas U.S. forces are dispersed globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems are poised to worsen. U.S. naval shipbuilding has been hampered by years of delays, backlogs, and cost overruns at its major shipyards. In 2024, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that less than 40 percent of U.S. Navy ships completed maintenance on time, compromising readiness and raising costs. A 2022 GAO report similarly found that a 20-year, $21 billion effort to modernize and optimize the U.S. Navy’s shipyards launched in 2018 had already seen its scheduling goals slip by three years and was 400 percent over budget after just the first 3 of 17 dry docks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant labor shortages in the U.S. industry are compromising production capacity as well. In a 2024 speech at CSIS, then-U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that the United States needed to fill a gap of “an additional 140,000 more skilled workers . . . to meet submarine production demand over the next 10 years.” These bottlenecks have direct implications for U.S. naval procurement: in 2025, the navy was forced to reduce its annual order of new Virginia-class attack submarines from two to one due to delays and ballooning costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is magnified even further by China’s use of its deep reserve of commercial vessels to augment military operations. For example, China is accelerating its production of “roll-on/roll-off” (ro-ro) ships, which are designed to carry commercial vehicles but can also be called on to transport troops and military equipment during a conflict. The PLA has actively incorporated civilian ro-ros into amphibious assault exercises and retrofitted some to meet military requirements, a practice that is explicitly prohibited in the U.S. Navy’s operational guidelines. More broadly, China has used a wide range of nominally civilian ships, including fishing vessels, research vessels, drilling vessels, and containerships, to operate in service of Beijing’s military and strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these dynamics are helping the PLAN grow its quantitative advantage over U.S. forces, creating a “quality all its own.” In 2022, U.S. STRATCOM commander Admiral Charles A. Richard remarked: “as I assess our level of deterrence against China, the ship is slowly sinking. As those curves keep going, it isn’t going to matter how good our [operating plan] is or how good our commanders are, or how good our forces are—we’re not going to have enough of them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ability to vastly outpace the U.S. industrial base in the production of naval and quasi-military vessels presents a concerning challenge to deterrence. A robust shipbuilding sector signals the capacity to sustain operations during a protracted conflict, particularly one one with the high losses that would almost certainly result from a full-scale U.S.-China kinetic war. Leaders in Beijing may calculate that China’s vastly greater ability to mobilize its shipbuilding ecosystem to surge production or restore and replace sunk and damaged vessels would allow it to continue a conflict to victory despite heavy losses. Even short of all-out war, this disparity could alter Beijing’s risk perceptions and shift escalation dynamics in unpredictable ways. Addressing this disparity is thus as much about preventing a war as it is about winning one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking beyond a near-term conflict, China’s shipbuilding capabilities will be key to supporting the PLAN’s transformation into a blue water force capable of operating anywhere in the world. China has rapidly expanded its expeditionary forces in recent years, building the first of a new class of aircraft carriers (the Type 003), launching four modern Type 075 amphibious assault vessels, and introducing the Type 076, a brand-new class of assault ship outfitted with an electromagnetic launch system likely optimized for unmanned platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These capabilities will allow China to project joint combat power farther from its coastline into areas such as the Western Pacific, South China Sea, and Indian Ocean. As the PLAN’s capabilities improve, political leaders in Beijing may be emboldened to act more aggressively to assert China’s expanding global interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-challenges&quot;&gt;Economic Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an economic standpoint, China’s anti-competitive practices and growing hold over global shipbuilding threatens to further undercut the industrial capabilities of the United States and its allies, marginalizing them from important emerging markets. This will foreclose important economic opportunities offered by an emerging wave of new shipbuilding orders driven largely by an industry-wide push to decarbonize fleets and transition to green technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and South Korea, once dominant players in shipbuilding, are experiencing shrinking market shares due to China’s aggressive expansion. In recent years, several major Japanese shipbuilders, including Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Mitsui E&amp;amp;S, and Sasebo Heavy Industries, have closed or reassigned their shipbuilding facilities due to rising costs and falling profits. Japan has seen the number of technical and engineering staff employed at its shipyards tumble to below 10,000, down from over 15,000 in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While South Korea’s industry has proven more resilient due to its strong position in high value-added sectors like LNG carriers and dual-fuel vessels, it also faces challenges from China’s booming shipyards. In 2024, South Korea’s market share in global shipbuilding fell below 20 percent for the first time in nearly a decade, despite strong demand and full orderbooks. A major contributing factor is that China’s share of global LNG tanker orders—where South Korean builders were previously dominant—has more than doubled since 2020, rising from 14 percent to 32 percent in 2024. This trend is partly driven by capacity limits at South Korea’s major shipyards, forcing buyers to look increasingly toward Chinese yards. Some Korean shipbuilders, like Samsung Heavy Industries, have even begun to outsource production to Chinese shipyards to help fill in gaps in capacity due to labor shortages and lack of dock space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European countries, traditional leaders in specialized shipbuilding sectors like cruise liners and icebreakers, face similar challenges as Chinese shipyards expand into these high-value markets. In 2024, CSSC’s Waigaoqiao shipyard delivered China’s first domestically built cruise ship, the Adora Magic City, to Adora Cruise Lines, a joint venture between CSSC and the U.S.-based company Carnival Cruises. The delivery represented a significant first step in challenging Europe’s dominance over the $117 billion passenger ship industry. This trend raises concerns about the sustainability of Europe’s shipbuilding industry and its ability to compete globally. In 2022, a German shipbuilding association said in a press release that “without a decisive response from Europe, the loss of substantial capabilities in this industry could turn out to be irreversible in the coming years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has maintained a negligible share of the global commercial shipbuilding market for decades, the rise of China’s shipbuilders has further hollowed out its commercial industry. Between 2014 and 2024, U.S. market share fell from 0.33 percent to 0.11, and since 2010, at least three major U.S. shipyards (Bender Shipyard, Avondale Shipyard, and Alabama Shipyard) have either closed down or suspended operations. Employment in the sector, which offers wages nearly 50 percent higher than the average private sector wage, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration, dropped by nearly 15 percent from 2008 to 2022, foreclosing high-quality economic opportunities for workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-countering-chinas-dual-use-shipbuilding-empire&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Countering China’s Dual-Use Shipbuilding Empire&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-objectives&quot;&gt;Policy Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs to take decisive action to address the multifaceted security and economic challenges posed by China’s shipbuilding industry. New policies should be framed around the following objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actively counter China’s MCF strategy by severing the flow of foreign capital and technology into Chinese shipyards.&lt;/strong&gt; Given measures already in place to limit U.S. ties with China’s defense industrial base, the focus needs to be on reducing the flow of capital and technology from other countries into Chinese shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce China’s dominance in the global shipbuilding industry.&lt;/strong&gt; Past experiences in industries like solar panels and electric vehicle batteries, where U.S. and allied firms were nearly completely pushed out of the market by low-cost Chinese manufacturing, offer sober warnings of what can happen without intervention. Taking action to limit China’s outsized influence will promote the economic security of not just the United States but also key U.S. allies like South Korea and Japan. Eroding China’s market dominance will also indirectly support the first objective of limiting Beijing’s ability to leverage its commercial shipbuilding industry to support its naval modernization through its MCF strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage friendshoring to key U.S. allies—namely South Korea and Japan—as a counterweight to China.&lt;/strong&gt; It will be impossible to completely shift commercial order books away from Chinese shipyards. There is too much global demand and not enough capacity outside of China (Chinese shipyards currently claim 62 percent of the global orderbook through 2033). It is similarly unrealistic to expect the United States to become a major player in the global shipbuilding market in the short-to-medium term. Achieving even a 5 percent market share would require a nearly 50-fold increase in domestic production. While the United States can take steps to scale up its industrial capacity, it should also prioritize enhancing the competitiveness of South Korea and Japan against their Chinese counterparts. This represents the most efficient and viable strategy for expanding alternative market options outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nurture U.S. domestic shipbuilding capacity in key areas.&lt;/strong&gt; Washington should set realistic goals for enhancing its domestic shipbuilding capacity. As noted above, even capturing a small share of the global market in the near-to-medium term would be a significant challenge. Rather than striving to become a global shipbuilding power, the United States should prioritize developing a commercial shipbuilding industry that meets critical national security needs. Investments should focus on these priorities rather than direct competition with China. This could also include developing specialized capabilities, such as icebreaker construction, and fostering technological innovation to strengthen the broader maritime industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit costs to the United States and its key international partners.&lt;/strong&gt; There are implicit tensions in the goals outlined above. The optimal set of policies will achieve important strategic and national security objectives while not overly burdening consumers and firms in the United States and allied countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;existing-lines-of-effort&quot;&gt;Existing Lines of Effort&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are nascent efforts underway in Washington to address some of these objectives. In April 2024, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) initiated a Section 301 investigation of “China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Targeting the Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors for Dominance.” The USTR launched the investigation at the request of petitioners comprising several labor unions seeking to protect the U.S. shipbuilding industry from unfair Chinese economic practices. Those petitioners sought several remedies, including a request that the government impose a fee on every Chinese-built vessel that docks at a U.S. port. They also recommended that the money collected from those fees be redirected to a “U.S. Commercial Shipbuilding Revitalization Fund” which could help support U.S. shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2025, the USTR released a public report based on its investigation, finding that China’s non-market practices in the shipbuilding, marine engineering, and logistics sectors had harmed U.S. commerce. It proposed a set of remedies, including an expansive docking fee regime on not only Chinese shipping companies, but also on any global shipping firms that operate Chinese-built vessels in their fleets (see Table 11). The proposal also calls for requirements to gradually increase the share of U.S. exports that should be carried on U.S.-flagged vessels, starting at 1 percent immediately and rising to 15 percent after seven years, at which point 5 percent must also be transported on U.S.-built vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also movement within Congress. In December 2024, a bipartisan group of senators and representatives introduced the SHIPS for America Act, which is the most significant legislation on U.S. maritime industrial revitalization in decades. It has the support of major U.S. shipbuilding industry groups and key figures in the Trump administration, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who played a key role in drafting the bill in his previous role as a member of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SHIPS for America Act offers numerous provisions to fund the growth of a U.S. commercial fleet and includes other incentives—such as substantial tax credits, loans, and loan guarantees—to invest in U.S. shipyards. Among its many different prospective programs, one of the most notable is the establishment of a “Strategic Commercial Fleet” of 250 privately owned U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, and U.S.-crewed oceangoing vessels. Crucially, the program would provide funding to cover the difference in costs that accrue from building and operating a U.S.-made and U.S.-flagged hull instead of buying a ship from a foreign shipyard or flagging it under another country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another crucial provision of the act is a series of incentives for recruiting the maritime workforce needed to sustain efforts to build up U.S. shipbuilding capacity. The bill offers loan forgiveness and educational assistance and funds recruiting programs for relevant U.S. government agencies. These steps will be essential to reducing the massive workforce deficit—a gap of over 100,000 in submarine production alone—while benefiting communities across the country with high-paying job opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-1&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following suite of policy recommendations offers a detailed road map for achieving the aforementioned objectives. Several of these recommendations build on and refine the existing lines of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impose scalable docking fees on global shipping companies operating Chinese-built vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States should adopt many elements of the USTR’s proposed docking fee scheme, but with notable changes. The primary issue with USTR’s proposal is that it is designed to impose costs on buying any Chinese-made ships; it does not differentiate between which Chinese ships are being bought. As a result, the scheme only achieves economic objectives. A better-designed proposal could achieve the same economic objectives while also achieving key national security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Taking even a limited sample of the types of activities impacted under USTR’s proposal reveals the wide-ranging impacts it could have on the shipping and shipbuilding industry. Table 12 provides an estimate of the annual docking fees that would apply to the top 10 container ship operators servicing U.S. ports, based only on the share of Chinese-built ships in their fleet (additional fees would apply based on their orderbooks and other factors). At a minimum, fees assessed on these 10 firms, which collectively represent roughly 70 percent of the container ship traffic at U.S. ports, would combine to over $8 billion per year. Top firms like MSC, Maersk, and CMA CGM would pay over $1 billion each.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rather than assigning docking fees based only on the share of total Chinese-built ships within a company’s fleet, the authors recommend designing the fees so that they are partially weighted according to which Chinese shipyards made those ships. This would allow for imposing greater pressure on China by targeting specific shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The tier system proposed in this report offers the most streamlined system for organizing and prioritizing fees. A company’s docking fees should be higher if it has a greater proportion of ships made at higher-risk shipyards. This could be achieved in several ways, and U.S. policymakers will need to fine-tune the fee structure. However, one general method would be to impose a blanket baseline fee along the lines proposed by USTR while layering on additional surcharge fees that are weighted according to the percentage of the fleet that comes from each of the tiers of Chinese shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The two tables below offer an example of how such a system could be designed. In these examples, a different multiplier value is assigned to each of the four tiers, and that multiplier is applied to each tier’s proportion of the company’s Chinese-made fleet to calculate the accompanying surcharge. Those surcharges are then summed to calculate the total percent surcharge that would be applied to the baseline USTR fee.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Table 13-A shows what a surcharge might look like for a hypothetical Chinese shipping company that has a higher percent of Tier-1 and Tier-2 ships in its fleets. Table 13-B depicts how a surcharge might be calculated on a hypothetical European shipping company that has fewer Tier-1 ships and more Tier-3 and Tier-4 ships. In this example, the Chinese company would face a significantly higher surcharge: 93 percent compared to 39 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This fee structure ensures that companies purchasing from high-risk shipyards bear the highest costs, encouraging them to shift orders elsewhere. For example, if a hypothetical Chinese shipping company (Table 13-A) acquired 60 percent of its fleet from China, it would have a baseline fee of $1 million per port call. With 2,000 annual port calls, its total fees, including surcharges, would reach about $3.9 billion per year. In contrast, if the European company (Table 13.B) got only 26 percent of its fleet from China, it would have a lower baseline fee of $750,000 per port call. With the same 2,000 annual port calls, its total fees with surcharges would be significantly lower, at $2.1 billion per year (see Table 14).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It is worth emphasizing that if the surcharges recommended here are adopted, the underlying baseline fees proposed by USTR could be scaled down to retain an optimal overall fee burden for the industry. Ultimately, this approach favors flexibility in enforcement to achieve the desired national security objectives while minimizing broader economic disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The proposed USTR docking fees could also be modified in another important way. As currently designed, the existing USTR proposal essentially creates fines for behavior that has already taken place. That is, it imposes fines for Chinese-made ships already in companies’ fleets plus ships already on order (to be delivered in the next 24 months). Yet, the goal of the fees should ultimately be to deter that behavior from taking place in the future. As such, future orders of ships from Chinese shipyards should result in greater fees than ships already bought or ordered. The simple solution for this is to impose higher docking fees if a company places an order from Chinese shipyards after a certain date.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Incorporating these changes has several advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;First, the United States would get more bang for its buck. Much of the costs imposed on shipping companies through docking fees are likely to be passed on to U.S. consumers. An optimal policy would impose more costs on China while not increasing the costs for U.S. consumers. This approach achieves that by raising the costs of supporting China’s defense industrial base while imposing the same overall costs on U.S. consumers as a blanket approach.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Second, a more tailored approach could make the financial burdens more manageable for the companies of U.S. allies and partners. As shown above, merchant shipping companies headquartered in Europe, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and other allied countries buy heavily from Chinese shipyards. Imposing blanket fines based on operating any Chinese-made ships creates costs without offering a clear remedy in the short term. If, however, companies have a clearer sense of which Chinese shipyards are most concerning, they can avoid Tier-1 and other higher-risk shipyards in the near term and buy from lower risk Chinese shipyards as a stopgap in the near term. This would ease the transition away from Chinese shipyards, making the policies more sustainable in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Third, weighting fees based on tiers would more directly undermine China’s MCF ambitions in the shipbuilding sector. If foreign orders decline at Tier-1 and Tier-2 shipyards, it will undercut Beijing’s ability to maximize the benefits of sharing resources between commercial and military production lines. In this scenario, Tier-1 shipyards may opt to become dedicated naval shipyards with little to no commercial production, while Tier-2 yards would be discouraged from being converted to military production. It is possible that China could avoid this scenario by simply replacing foreign commercial ship orders at these yards with ship orders by Chinese-owned shipping companies, but this would still be a policy success from a U.S. perspective because it would mean that foreign companies will no longer be funneling resources directly into shipyards producing warships for China’s navy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Finally, CSSC-owned yards (i.e. those in Tier-1 and Tier-2) and other state-owned shipyards (i.e., in Tier-3) have likely received more direct support through state-driven industrial policies. They are also, by definition, under more direct supervision by the Chinese Communist Party and the state than private firms, meaning they are most aligned with Beijing’s strategic interests. Accordingly, ships built in their shipyards should come at a premium for foreign buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In short, China will continue to build commercial vessels and military vessels, and it will try to continue to integrate those production lines to support its MCF ambitions. The United States cannot stop China from doing so, but it can put in place policies that help level the playing field and incentivize Chinese shipbuilders to change their behavior—all while mitigating the negative economic fallout for the United States and like-minded countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sever remaining U.S. financial and business ties with CSSC and its subsidiaries.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On national security grounds, the U.S. government should restrict U.S. companies from conducting any financial transactions with the 35 Tier-1 and Tier-2 shipbuilders owned by CSSC. Tier-1 shipyards directly build warships for the PLAN, and Tier-2 yards have clearly defined links to China’s defense industrial base and broader national security apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are precedents for such moves. In September 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that would prohibit the sale or import of connected vehicles integrating specific pieces of hardware and software (or their components) if they have sufficient ties to Chinese or Russian companies. In 2021, President Biden signed into law the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which presumes that goods manufactured in China’s Xinjiang Region are made with forced labor and therefore bans their importation into the United States, unless proven otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monitor Chinese shipyards and remain flexible in enforcing actions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As Washington takes these actions, regulators should periodically monitor activity at Chinese shipyards and evaluate whether additional companies need to be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The tiered system outlined in this report is a useful first step toward assessing the relative level of threat and concern posed by Chinese shipyards, but as previously noted, China’s shipbuilding ecosystem is murky. Firms not directly building warships can still provide significant support for China’s ongoing naval modernization, and private firms can be co-opted by the party-state to support national security objectives. To make U.S. measures as effective as possible, analysts from various U.S. government agencies—including the intelligence community—should coordinate to vigilantly monitor the evolving situation and adjust course as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use targeted diplomacy to encourage other countries to limit ties with China’s dual-use shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Measures to dissuade firms from buying from or transferring technology to Tier 1 and 2 Chinese shipyards will be far more effective if coordinated with key countries that also share concern over China’s military modernization. The vast majority of firms that engage in these kinds of transactions are based in key U.S.-allied nations in Europe and Asia. In addition, much of the dual-use technology transfer into China’s shipbuilding ecosystem has occurred through companies based outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Parallel measures by like-minded governments would reduce the opportunity for China to exploit loopholes to help its firms circumvent penalties and undermine the effectiveness of U.S. actions. While these measures may rankle some allied governments that are home to companies benefitting from business deals with China’s dual-use shipyards, they also will bring about opportunities for their own shipbuilding industries to benefit from the growth in global demand for ships built by shipyards outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;President Trump has made clear that he expects U.S. allies and partners to increase their own investments and other efforts to compete with China in the security and economic domains. His administration should incorporate discussions on shipbuilding into its broader strategy to rally allies and partners in pushing back against China’s MCF efforts and unfair economic practices.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most other nations will not be as forward-leaning as the United States on this issue, as they will be worried about the potential costs for their companies and any diplomatic blowback from Beijing. Nevertheless, as a baseline, Washington should encourage its allies to take quiet, informal actions to discourage their companies from buying from Tier-1 shipyards. This is particularly true of Taiwan, as it stands to lose the most from China’s ongoing naval modernization. At a minimum, the United States should work with other countries to better align their technology restrictions to ensure key dual-use technologies are not directly helping upgrade China’s naval capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, taking the more tailored approach outlined above (i.e., focusing on the most concerning shipyards rather than all Chinese shipyards) will present a far more palatable offer for allies and partners. In the past, Washington has been able to better rally other countries to its side when it can demonstrate that it is taking targeted measures to address specific issues rather than a broader pursuit of strategic containment against China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make targeted investments in long-term shipbuilding capacity in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The punitive and protective measures outlined above will help reduce China’s dominance over the shipbuilding industry, but building up even a minimally viable commercial shipbuilding capacity in the United States will require significant investment. Given fiscal and budgetary constraints, alongside limited political appetite for major public investments, the U.S. government will need to find creative funding mechanisms to spur investment in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One clear path to establishing a funding baseline for maritime revitalization is through the imposition of the proposed targeted docking fees collected from shipping firms operating Chinese-built vessels. As indicated above, a conservative estimate of a tier-focused fee regime could raise tens of billions of dollars per year—funding that can be reinvested in jumpstarting U.S. shipbuilding activity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers should be clear-eyed about what can be achieved through public investment in the industry. Washington should not seek or expect to make the United States a global shipbuilding powerhouse. The U.S. shipbuilding industry currently accounts for just 0.11 percent of global production, meaning even a 50-fold increase would bring it to just 5.5 percent. Still, these investments can help the United States build up a minimum shipbuilding capacity needed to meet national security and strategic requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attract foreign investment into the U.S. shipbuilding industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Investments in U.S. shipyards need not only come from U.S. coffers. Washington should encourage and incentivize key global players—especially South Korea and Japan—to invest in U.S. shipbuilders. Policymakers should also court investment from European companies that are global leaders in high-tech areas of the shipbuilding industry. Doing so would bring much-needed jobs, expertise, and capital into the U.S. industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In 2024, South Korean company Hanhwa purchased a leading U.S. shipbuilder, Philly Shipyard, for $100 million, and there are indications that Hanhwa could significantly expand its capacity there and potentially also expand its footprint to include other U.S. shipyards. Such investments should be encouraged going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government can also take steps to facilitate educational exchanges, technical trainings, and knowledge-sharing efforts between its workforce and those from allies like South Korea and Japan. While these exchanges can be hampered by language and cultural differences, the U.S. government can take steps to mitigate these challenges by providing translation support and cultural trainings.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Understandably, even with allies there can be national security concerns about foreign ownership and investment in strategically important industries. However, these deals can be constructed to include provisions to protect national security while still allowing for foreign ownership or investment. U.S. investment screeners, namely the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), should avoid being overprotective when reviewing investments from two of the United States’ closest and most important Indo-Pacific allies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In February 2025, the Trump administration signaled it would take steps along these lines with the America First Investment Policy memorandum. The policy aims to streamline the investment review process for allied and partner sources, while placing heavier restrictions on investments from Chinese firms or companies that support China’s MCF activities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Beyond reducing barriers to investment, Washington should identify areas in which the United States can offer reciprocal investments in partner economies. Failing to do so would risk foregoing needed investments in the United States and alienating close U.S. partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coordinate with partners to build additional shipbuilding capacity outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Beyond implementing the proposed penalties on companies operating Chinese-built vessels, the United States can help incentivize investment in allied shipbuilding capacity by creating market demand for ships built outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One approach is to require that a certain subset of U.S. goods be transported on a list of trusted vessels that were built in the United States or select partner countries. The USTR proposal includes a far more expanded restriction, requiring that a progressively increasing share of U.S. exports be transported by U.S.-flagged vessels. To limit broader economic impacts, this requirement could be narrowed to apply only to critical strategic goods essential to national security, like LNG or critical minerals, or be adjusted to allow some cargo to be carried by vessels built in trusted shipyards outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another model is to directly collaborate with other countries on the development of specialized shipbuilding technologies needed for strategic applications. This approach has shown some promise. In July 2024, the United States, Canada, and Finland came together to establish the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or ICE Pact. The trilateral partnership focuses on bolstering the shipbuilding capacity of all three countries, including promoting the exchange of information and expertise in the field of icebreakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;President Trump had likewise signaled the importance of a U.S. icebreaker fleet to secure U.S. and allied interests in the polar regions. In 2020, he issued a memorandum calling for “a ready, capable, and available fleet of polar security icebreakers that is operationally tested and fully deployable by Fiscal Year 2029.” President Trump has since signaled his dislike of the Biden administration’s ICE Pact, instead preferring to go it alone. Yet given the limitations on U.S. shipbuilding capacity, the ICE Pact’s multilateral approach may offer the best chance of fielding a capable icebreaker fleet in the near term. If the existing ICE Pact does not meet President Trump’s expectations, his administration should look for ways to revise it rather than scrapping it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More broadly, the Trump administration should remain open to multilateral cooperation on shipbuilding, as it offers the best opportunity to quickly and successfully erode China’s dominant position and achieve lasting gains in the shipbuilding industry. The United States and its allies and partners would bring different assets to such efforts. South Korea and Japan possess raw shipbuilding capacity as well as decades of expertise and experience in high-capacity, advanced shipbuilding techniques. South Korea, in particular, is a global leader in producing LNG tankers, which are some of the most technologically complex commercial vessels in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;European companies are also prominent in developing technologies and subcomponents that support the global industry. For its part, the United States is limited in its experience in producing massive oceangoing vessels, but its shipyards are relatively more proficient in building smaller ships optimized for regional trade.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Even without a major presence within the industry itself, Washington does have immense convening power and market potential. If it puts its diplomatic and economic heft behind multilateral efforts, it could help to create and lead a network of builders and suppliers that can collectively be more competitive vis-à-vis China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, as Washington works with its allies and partners, it should look for specific areas where they can make targeted gains. In some areas, such as massive containerships, China’s lead may be insurmountable in the near and medium term. In other areas, however, the United States and its partners may be able to make greater headway. Efforts should focus on identifying less-mature technologies—such as autonomous navigation or future-fuel engines—where opportunities remain to leapfrog China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Sir John Chilcot published the “Report of the Iraq Inquiry”. The 2.6-million-word forensic investigation covers the political and military dimensions of the 2003 Iraq War and all UK government departments that were involved. He concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The decision to use force – a very serious decision for any government to take – provoked profound controversy in relation to Iraq and … continues to shape debates on national security policy and the circumstances in which to intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) adapted the magnus opus into “The Good Operation” handbook “to prompt its readers to ask the right questions as they plan for and execute a military operation”. Contained within is a 10 point “Chilcot Checklist” which explicitly invites challenges to the plan where concerns are held. If applied retrospectively to recent UK operations in Afghanistan from 2006 (when the UK led the decision to significantly expand the NATO operation to a country-wide strategy) or Libya in 2011, it is clear – especially with hindsight – that they should not have even been attempted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, it is highly unlikely that Ukraine will receive US security guarantees and therefore it is increasingly likely that a European military force will be required to deploy to Ukraine to deter Russia and support a ceasefire and subsequent attempts to forge a path to conflict resolution, if not peace. Russia – and the US under its current leadership – would not agree to a NATO operation. The EU lacks the capabilities, experience and maturity to do it, even if the Berlin+ agreements were activated to allow the EU the use of the NATO command structure. This leaves some form of a “coalition of the willing” as the only option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not yet know the requirement, but potential options range from a small “tripwire” force, to a multinational Division, initially of 20,000 troops, a 30,000-40,000 strong “reassurance force”, or at the top end a 100,000 plus “traditional peacekeeping force”. Europeans might be able to do the first three on their own – especially with Turkish support – but a global force would likely be required to sustain the latter option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Keir Starmer is already leading on building a coalition of up to 20 countries. In doing so, it is imperative that the Prime Minister makes the Chilcot Checklist front and centre of the decision-making. While very familiar to military officers and MoD civil servants, it must be brought out of the dark and into all government departments and internationalised to coalition partners. With key New Labour figures from 2003 back in government - UK Ambassador to the US Lord Mandelson and National Security Advisor Jonathan Powell – the Prime Minister can call on valuable and rare institutional memory of how the UK government got decisions between 2001 and 2003 drastically wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluating the potential mission for the UK in Ukraine though the checklist, currently only two are satisfied, a further two are developing, and six are not even close to being satisfied. Time is also against Europe, but the Prime Minister must not cut corners. The full list should be satisfied before he takes the decision to Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-for-intervention&quot;&gt;The Case for Intervention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two principles are the strongest case for intervention and are arguably already satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, “Vision: Why do we care?”: The Prime Minister is clear that “the future of Ukraine is vital for our national security” and is firmly in UK national interest. He is supported by his electorate with UK public concern and support for Ukraine still very high. Supporting a ceasefire and path to peace in Ukraine is also morally right and firmly within UK values as Russia is the clear aggressor and continues to deliberately target Ukrainian civilians across the country. Moreover, it is also consistent with long-term UK strategy which has supported Ukraine militarily since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the UK’s current role as the third largest provider of military, humanitarian and economic assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, “Analysis: What is happening now?”: Unlike in 2003 – where flawed intelligence and its management were ultimately responsible for the policy failure - the situational awareness now is much clearer. Indeed, the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine reclaimed public trust in the UK-US intelligence relationship which was lost after 2003. The Prime Minister is acutely aware of the gravity of the situation and described it as a “pivotal moment” for Europe when he announced a recent uplift in defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral imperative is clear, and similar arguments were made for intervening in Afghanistan and Iraq, alongside other post-Cold War “humanitarian” operations. However, the decision to deploy military force must be grounded in the reality of what is militarily achievable, by when this can be done, and, crucially, what to do if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-developing-situation&quot;&gt;The Developing Situation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principles 3 and 4 are being developed in real-time between the US and Russia, who are bilaterally setting the requirements, with European countries struggling to influence matters from the outside. Therefore, it is critical that the UK and European allies have a stake in the negotiations to shape a ceasefire which they can protect. This should be the Prime Minister’s leading request to President Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both “Scenarios: What might happen next?” and “Options: What should we do?” are fundamentals of defence planning. It is the process of assessing the situation and developing “courses of action” and a “concept of operations” for the mission. These will change and be refined not only up to a potential deployment, but also when deployed in theatre, as the situation changes. Critical to a successful coalition of the willing is a broad agreement of the risks, opportunities and costs of an operation, and the equal burden-sharing among contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OouDU0q.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;The ten points of the Chilcot Checklist.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: “The Good Operation” handbook / MoD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest risk is that governments in 2025 might have to sign up for an open-ended commitment. While not completely analogous to the situation in Ukraine, 28,500 US troops are still stationed in the Republic of Korea – 72 years after the armistice was signed. In addition, the NATO Kosovo force (KFOR) is still active 26 years after the intervention and the UK still periodically reinforces the mission such as in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no clear end in sight, the Prime Minister would be asking Parliament – and his partners – to take an unprecedented leap of faith. Before he does this, the scenarios and options must be crystal clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-against-intervention&quot;&gt;The Case Against Intervention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final six Chilcot principles – on a current understanding of the potential operation – provide very strong arguments and challenge against deploying a UK-led force to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, “Legal Implications: How do we ensure action is lawful?”: Securing a UN Security Council mandate for the operation would be challenging, but not impossible, especially with Trump’s bending of the knee to Russia since his inauguration. Moreover, in a coalition of the willing there is always the danger that each participating country brings with it legal definitions – especially if they are not exclusively European states. Moreover, caveats to deployment can also hinder effective working and risk profiles, which plagued operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere. It is an important consideration that a UN mandate might give the mission legitimacy, but it is not a guarantee of mission success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, “Policy and Strategy: What does success look like?”: This is fundamental as, simply put, the mission cannot fail. If it did, the loss of credibility for Europe, and by extension to NATO and the EU, would likely undermine European security to the point that it would completely unravel and hand decisive strategic advantage to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key requirement for the Prime Minister is the master principle of war - “selection and maintenance of the aim”. However, three years after the invasion, none of the four UK Prime Ministers have been able to articulate exactly what Ukrainian victory – and Russian defeat – looks like. A favoured tagline is that the UK will support Ukraine “as long as it takes” without actually defining what “it” is. Therefore, the Prime Minister must develop, agree, and ruthlessly enforce the mission objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, “Resource: what do we need to Deliver?”: The minimum contribution for the UK would be a Brigade (5,000), alongside a lion’s share of the command and control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance assets and logistics enablers. But it would require 15,000 to sustain this force indefinitely (one in theatre, one recovering and one training) or 20% of the total British Army strength and approximately 50% of the Field Army. Committing this force to an open-ended operation would effectively be permanently removing these troops from the British Army order of battle. As such, it would put a UK “NATO first” strategy in jeopardy and the commitment to be the Alliance’s strategic reserve. Moreover, it is not just a question of numbers – this force are not peacekeepers. They need to have the full heavy suite of military equipment available to deter Russian attacks, and – if required – to fight and fix Russian forces in Ukraine if a wider war between NATO and Russia originated in the Nordic or Baltic states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, “Planning and Doing: How should we do it?”: The UK cannot lead alone and a Franco-British political and military leadership team appears to be emerging. The UK and France are extremely close allies, both backed by nuclear forces, both deployed at Brigade level previously (UK in Afghanistan, France in the Sahel), and have the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF) as a crucible of interoperability between the two militaries. As such, they remain the only two true framework nations of Europe which are capable of commanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while this construct sounds feasible, if challenging, it is likely insufficient. A Two-Star Headquarters would be too small for such a deployment and the CJEF is optimised for crisis management – not defence and deterrence. Therefore, it would have to both scale – to a Divisional level - and re-role to defence and deterrence prior to any deployment which would take a significant amount of time. The potential political pitfalls are greater than the military challenges. If Le Pen wins the 2027 Presidential Election and then withdraws the French contingent from the mission, it will put the UK in a lonely command position, regardless of the hit to resources. Such an eventuality could be fatal for mission success and is something President Macron cannot guarantee, no matter how committed he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, both “Policy Performance: how will you monitor performance?” and “Evaluation: Is the policy working” are ultimately about measuring performance and success criteria. Without knowing the mission, it is impossible to evaluate these. However, once the UK is committed it cannot withdraw, vastly reducing the options available to it. As the leading country, the UK will be impacted by failure the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-worst-case-scenario&quot;&gt;The Worst-Case Scenario&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister is in an invidious position. He must prepare for a potential UK-led mission. However, in preparing for it, he also makes it more likely, as Trump will regard it as an option available to him. However, the consequences of mission failure would be fatal to European security. It would be better to not even attempt an operation at all, rather than get bounced into a poorly defined mission by Trump and be left with the consequences. Wanting to finalise the blueprint for the coalition of the willing this week, ahead of any US-Russia-Ukraine deal, only increased the risk of a poorly developed operation from deploying and therefore also succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent memories than 2003 also cast a long shadow. The 2021 chaotic fall of Kabul was a direct product of a bad Trump Doha deal with the Taliban. Yet, Afghanistan was always a discretionary operation, with peripheral interest to the UK – loosely recognised as support to the US. However, this support did not stop Vice President JD Vance’s recently disrespecting UK and French troops by saying a US minerals deal was a “better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years”, demonstrating how fickle the US can be in its leadership and outlook. Over-committing UK troops to uphold US foreign policy was as bad a policy after 9/11 as it is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a truism of military planning is that “the enemy gets a vote.” Indeed, putting static and open-ended European forces into Ukraine – that are explicitly not covered by NATO’s Article V – provides Putin a delicious opportunity to weaken the Alliance. It is anything but a deterrent. He will use the full levers of his military and special services to undermine the operation with an inability for the Europeans to respond in fear of escalation. At its most dangerous, he might choose to deliberately target European forces but insist that such attacks were the result of technical failures or misunderstandings, challenging the Europeans to respond. Each event would serve to undermine the strength of European commitment in the face of Russian aggression and would indirectly cut away at the credibility of Article V even when it was not enforceable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six months ago, few in the West aside from obsessive AI professionals had heard of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI research lab founded barely more than a year and a half ago. Today, DeepSeek is a global sensation attracting the attention of heads of state, global CEOs, top investors, and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the release of its R1 model on January 20, 2025—the same day as President Trump’s second inauguration—DeepSeek has cemented its reputation as the top frontier AI research lab in China and caused a reassessment of assumptions about the landscape of global AI competition. By January 27, DeepSeek’s iPhone app had overtaken OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on Apple’s U.S. App Store. The stock prices of some U.S. tech companies briefly tumbled, including the AI chip designer Nvidia, which lost more than $600 billion off its valuation in a single day. (AI chips are also known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, and the terms are used interchangeably in this report.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT has again overtaken DeepSeek in app store rankings, and Nvidia’s stock price has since mostly recovered. However, investor interest in Chinese tech companies has grown significantly and remains elevated. DeepSeek is now even reportedly seeking investment from venture capital firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a sector, AI is prone to overreactions and wild swings in perception. One might think that the story of DeepSeek is just another overblown AI hype cycle. However, the extraordinary attention focused on DeepSeek is justified, even if the conclusions some have drawn from its success are not. It would be a great mistake for U.S. policymakers to ignore DeepSeek or to suggest that its accomplishments are merely a combination of intellectual property theft and misleading Chinese propaganda. Policymakers need to understand that—even while DeepSeek has in some cases simply implemented innovations already known to U.S. AI companies—DeepSeek has also demonstrated genuine technological breakthroughs of its own. These facts deserve careful consideration as the second Trump administration sets its AI policy agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper provides an overview of DeepSeek’s origins and achievements, their geopolitical implications, and the key challenges facing U.S. and allied policymaking as a result. The paper pays particular attention to DeepSeek’s implications for the future of AI and semiconductor export control policy. It concludes that—while DeepSeek’s success does partly reflect failures of earlier implementations of U.S. export controls—these controls can continue to play a critical role in supporting the United States’ strategy for winning the AI race against China. Success is not guaranteed and will require two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preventing large-scale AI chip smuggling and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preventing the team of Huawei and SMIC from providing a viable Chinese AI chip alternative to the leading incumbent international team of Nvidia and TSMC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both will be exceedingly difficult, and in both cases export controls can at best slow and disrupt Chinese efforts, not stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the second point, Chinese sources and leaders are expressing renewed optimism. At a meeting on February 17 between Chinese Community Party (CCP) Chairman Xi Jinping and Chinese technology executives (including DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng), Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei told Xi that his previous concerns about the lack of domestic advanced semiconductor production and the damaging impacts of U.S. export controls had eased because of recent breakthroughs by Huawei and its partners. Ren further said that he is leading a network of more than 2,000 Chinese companies who are collectively working to ensure that China achieves self-sufficiency of more than 70 percent across the entire semiconductor value chain by 2028. These predictions should be taken seriously. While China’s economy faces many challenges, Gerard DiPippo of RAND is correct to argue,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even if overall economic growth remains comparatively weak and many Chinese firms continue to struggle, China’s central and local governments will keep supporting high-tech industries and emerging stars like DeepSeek. . . . Western policymakers shouldn’t make the mistake of believing China is down and out, and they shouldn’t be surprised when China continues to catch up or make breakthroughs in critical and emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows are a series of 21 key judgments regarding DeepSeek, Huawei, export controls, and the future of U.S.-China AI competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers are advised to pay special attention to the discussion of Huawei and SMIC, as this report contains a great deal of new and previously private information regarding Huawei’s progress toward indigenizing China’s AI and semiconductor technology stack.&lt;/p&gt;

DeepSeek did not come out of nowhere. Its parent company, High-Flyer Capital Management, has roots in AI-enabled high frequency trading that provided a strong technical foundation in terms of both computing infrastructure and workforce talent.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek is a subsidiary of High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund focused on algorithmic trading powered by deep learning. Deep learning is the core technology paradigm underlying the past two decades of rapid AI advancements. Cofounded in 2015 by Liang Wenfeng, who is also the founder and CEO of DeepSeek, High-Flyer was already ranked as the top Chinese hedge fund in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s heritage via High-Flyer in the algorithmic trading world helps to explain its success in frontier AI research and especially its success with its most recent model releases. Algorithmic trading firms frequently own and operate their own data center infrastructure, which they use to develop proprietary investment strategies powered by machine learning artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-Flyer has admitted that its activities include “High-Frequency Trading,” though High-Flyer de-emphasizes this work since it is politically controversial (and was for a time banned) in China. High-frequency trading firms race against each other to be the fastest asset traders reacting to new market developments and are obsessively focused on optimizing and accelerating their computing infrastructure. These efforts routinely include intense research on developing proprietary and unorthodox data center engineering methods for improved speed and efficiency. Firms can justify making these expensive investments in computing and network infrastructure optimization because the success or failure of trades collectively worth billions of dollars depends upon reducing the time between learning of a fact and making a stock trade based on that new fact by mere nanoseconds (billionths of a second).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-Flyer is among the leaders of such firms in China and has long been among the most focused on both AI algorithms for trading and data center engineering. The Financial Times reported that, by mid-2022, High-Flyer had already acquired more than 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips (which at the time were the most advanced AI chips in the world) and spent more than 1.2 billion RMB (roughly $180 million at the time) to build two data centers. These infrastructure investments distinguished High-Flyer from most other Chinese companies: Only four other companies in China possessed such a large quantity of chips at the time, and all were major tech companies, not finance companies. In a 2023 interview, Liang said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We always wanted to carry out larger-scale experiments, so we’ve always aimed to deploy as much computational power as possible. . . . We wanted to find a paradigm that can fully describe the entire financial market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another 2023 interview with a Chinese media outlet, Liang provided a timeline for High-Flyer’s AI chip compute reserves as a gradual “progression from one GPU in the beginning, to 100 GPUs in 2015, 1,000 GPUs in 2019.” He stated that, from the day of DeepSeek’s 2023 founding onward, High-Flyer had both the computational power and “ample R&amp;amp;D budgets” to support DeepSeek’s mission of “research and exploration” in pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s heritage from High-Flyer’s machine learning research and intensive computing optimization techniques are evident in some of the strategies that it has pursued to develop its AI models. More broadly, the synergy of technical skills between the world of algorithmic trading and AI research is well known. For example, industry sources at leading U.S. AI labs told CSIS that they have also focused on recruiting talent, especially compute infrastructure engineers, with experience in the high-frequency trading industry. Both sectors pay such talented individuals handsomely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-deepseeks-technological-achievements-in-terms-of-performance-and-cost-were-not-surprising-they-reflected-a-continuation-of-longstanding-trends-however-the-fact-that-such-achievements-came-from-a-chinese-lab-was-a-surprise&quot;&gt;2. DeepSeek’s technological achievements in terms of performance and cost were not surprising. They reflected a continuation of longstanding trends. However, the fact that such achievements came from a Chinese lab was a surprise.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s recent technological achievements (reflected in the DeepSeek-V2, DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek Math, and Native Sparse Attention technical papers) can most easily be understood through two basic facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, DeepSeek has demonstrated a suite of algorithmic and architectural improvements that significantly reduce the amount of computing power (and therefore financial investment) required for any AI model to reach and operate at a given level of performance. This is true for both the training stage (in which AI models are created) and the inference stage (in which their capabilities are used to serve internal or external customers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, DeepSeek has now developed AI models in China that are broadly comparable to the best U.S.-developed AI models introduced in mid-2024 (e.g., OpenAI’s o1 or Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the two demonstrations, the fact that these advances came from China is more surprising than the fact that they happened at all. DeepSeek’s improvements in technical performance were consistent with preexisting trend lines of AI performance improvements. They represent expected performance breakthroughs, not shocking ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand why, it is helpful to consider an analogy in the form of Moore’s Law. In economic terms, Moore’s Law essentially means that computer chips improve to be roughly twice as good in performance for the same amount of money roughly every two years. Though the nature of that performance improvement has changed, this trend has been consistently observed for almost six decades (with some caveats).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Moore’s Law has been repeatedly validated since the 1960s, it has become steadily easier to confidently predict that computing performance per dollar will continue to double every two years. But, as the fortunes of Intel vividly demonstrate, that is not synonymous with being able to state with confidence which specific company or which specific technical innovations will deliver that improved performance. The same is true of AI today: It is easier to forecast the degree of AI performance growth than to forecast who will invent that performance growth or how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI has its own versions of Moore’s Law that are driving exponential growth in both absolute performance and performance available at a given cost. At a high level, these sources of improvement can be grouped into three types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing available computing resources (either by using better computer chips, more chips, or both);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improving algorithms and architectures (for example, to deliver more “intelligence” for a given compute budget); and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improving the quality and/or quantity of available training data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epoch AI, an AI-focused nonprofit research institute, has estimated that, while the amount of human-generated training data will likely plateau in 2028, algorithmic and architectural improvements and increased computing resources have been improving at 3x per year and 4.6x per year respectively—for a combined multiplier effect of 13.8x per year. In short, AI performance is increasing at a rate far faster than the familiar (though still extraordinary) pace of exponential progress described by Moore’s Law. Even ignoring the possible remaining improvements from harvesting additional training data, a (highly oversimplified) back-of-the-envelope estimate of future performance based on the compute trends and algorithmic architectural trends would suggest that AI performance at the end of 2028 will be more than 36,000 times better than at the beginning of 2025, rather than just the four or eight times better that would be true if improvement were only occurring at the familiar pace of Moore’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who only began paying attention to AI with the late 2022 launch of ChatGPT, this pace of progress can be both breathtaking and difficult to believe. However, for those familiar with the AI industry’s history over the past two decades, the fact that an AI model that requires a massive data center one year can run on a laptop or a single AI chip a few years later is well-known as a recurring, though still quite incredible, phenomenon. The dramatic reduction in cost-per-performance DeepSeek demonstrated is not a surprise to Western AI researchers. They have been leaders in driving—and benefitting from—the exact same trend for more than a decade. One might ask: “If that is the case, why are U.S. AI labs still building ever larger and more powerful data centers?” Put simply, such companies are reinvesting all efficiency gains toward improved overall performance. Dario Amodei, CEO of the U.S. AI lab Anthropic, put it this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because the value of having a more intelligent system is so high, this [reduced cost] shifting of the curve typically causes companies to spend more, not less, on training models: the gains in cost efficiency end up entirely devoted to training smarter models, limited only by the company’s financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, AI researchers are clearly nowhere near the absolute ceiling of computational performance and efficiency. The human brain is a real-world existence proof of human-level intelligence that requires only 20 watts of electricity, compared to the megawatts or gigawatts contemplated for future AI data centers. Despite the many differences between human brains and machine intelligence, the existence of the brain hints at future intelligence efficiency possibilities in much the same way that bird wings inspired the Wright brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is not at all surprising that somewhere on earth, an AI research lab managed to deliver the improved AI performance-per-dollar that DeepSeek’s technical papers demonstrate. The only surprise is that the research lab that discovered some of the relevant technical innovations is a Chinese one, and notably one whose technical team appears to have been educated and trained almost entirely in China, rather than at Western universities or Western companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese researchers have been at or close to world class in many domains of AI research for many years, DeepSeek represents the first time that a Chinese AI lab has demonstrated breakthroughs at or near the absolute frontier of foundational AI research. Many of the techniques that DeepSeek demonstrated are now the new state-of-the-art. Of note, this is exactly what the Chinese government set as a goal in China’s 2017 official AI strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By 2025, China will achieve major breakthroughs in basic theories for AI, such that some technologies and applications achieve a world-leading level and AI becomes the main driving force for China’s industrial upgrading and economic transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

DeepSeek’s technological innovations are real, not propaganda. They have been in all cases proven to work by Western researchers who replicated DeepSeek’s approach.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first week after the publication of DeepSeek’s R1 paper, some commentators argued that DeepSeek’s results were fabricated as part of a Chinese propaganda effort or “psyop.” This is simply false. Researchers at U.S. universities have already reproduced some of the research results described in the DeepSeek V3 and R1 papers, and U.S. AI firms are already working on adapting DeepSeek’s novel techniques to utilize them in their own AI efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As will be discussed further in this paper, essentially all DeepSeek’s technical innovations relate to algorithmic and architectural improvements. DeepSeek did not have superior computing hardware, nor did they have access to uniquely important datasets (excluding synthetic data) that might have provided an advantage over Western researchers. The key technical innovations that DeepSeek demonstrated across the DeepSeek-V2 (May 2024), DeepSeek-V3 (December 2024), DeepSeek-R1 (January 2025), and other research papers are significant. Some of these innovations had already been independently discovered by U.S. firms (and not disclosed publicly), but others were genuinely new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-deepseeks-success-in-large-part-reflects-the-lagging-impact-of-the-flawed-first-package-of-us-ai-chip-export-controls-in-october-2022-the-us-government-acknowledged-and-partially-remedied-these-flaws-in-its-october-2023-update&quot;&gt;4. DeepSeek’s success in large part reflects the lagging impact of the flawed first package of U.S. AI chip export controls in October 2022. The U.S. government acknowledged and partially remedied these flaws in its October 2023 update.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many media and policy commentators in the United States and China have argued that DeepSeek’s efficiency gains are evidence that U.S. export controls have failed to restrain China’s AI sector and that DeepSeek proves that huge numbers of cutting-edge U.S. AI chips are not required for developing and serving high-performance AI capabilities. There is some merit to aspects of the first claim, but the second is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, DeepSeek’s V3 research paper states that their models were trained on 2,788,000 GPU-hours using Nvidia H800 chips, which, at an estimated cost of 2 dollars per GPU-hour, equates to $5.576 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The H800 is a degraded version of the H100 chip that Nvidia specifically developed for the Chinese market to comply with the U.S. export controls imposed on October 7, 2022. In particular, those controls restricted the sale of chips that exceeded performance thresholds across two metrics: total processing power and interconnect speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government sources told CSIS that the U.S. government knew that these restrictions would prevent Nvidia from shipping its (at the time) market-leading A100 chip and upcoming H100 chips. They inferred that Chinese customers would be restricted to using the V100, which was first introduced in 2017 and has significantly lower performance than its successors. Additionally, the U.S. government assumed that, if Nvidia were to develop a new chip specifically for the Chinese market that exceeded export control performance thresholds in one metric but not the other, this would require the typical multiyear AI chip development timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the U.S. government architects of the October 2022 export control policy did not realize, however, was that Nvidia had a mechanism for post-manufacturing modification of its existing chip products. Specifically, each Nvidia chip is designed for redundancy, recoverability, and defect tolerance to minimize the impact of manufacturing defects. Such defects are a significant concern in the advanced node semiconductor industry, and designing chips to mitigate their potential impact is near universal. Nvidia can blow one or more strategically placed electrical fuses on the chip so that a manufacturing defect would usually only reduce the chip’s performance or deactivate a redundant component, rather than rendering the entire chip nonfunctional. Industry sources confirmed to CSIS that Nvidia blew fuses on A100 chips to reduce their interconnect speed (but not their processing power) below the export control performance thresholds, thus creating the A800 product lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, the A100 was born with the capability to become an A800 if needed, via fuse settings. The H800, by contrast, did involve some minor Nvidia re-engineering and design optimization in the face of export controls. This allowed Nvidia to continue shipping large volumes of advanced AI chips (with performance near the global state of the art) to China without violating export controls and without taking multiple years to design new chips specifically for the Chinese market. According to reporting by The Information, the performance of the A800 and H800 chips was close enough to the performance of the originals that there was effectively no demand for large-scale AI chip smuggling to China during the period in which A800s and H800s were available. Why smuggle when the legally purchased chips are good enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration ultimately realized that continued sales of the A800 and H800 meant that their policy would not have the intended impact on China’s AI ecosystem. Former government officials told CSIS that this was clear internally by December 2022. However, it took the administration 12 months after their initial package of export controls to act. The U.S. government modified the export control performance thresholds in October 2023 to block exports of A800s, H800s, and any non-Nvidia chips with comparable performance to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the year-long period in which A800 and H800 chip exports to China were legal, an enormous number of them were sold to China. Precise sales figures are not available, but Nvidia’s disclosed sales to China between October 31, 2022, and October 31, 2023, exceeded 9 billion dollars. This does include revenue for chips that were not widely used in AI training or inference, however. See Table 1 for Nvidia’s quarterly revenue by billing locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uX1FE1d.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Nvidia Quarterly Revenue by Billing Location.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Nvidia Quarterly and Annual SEC Filings; CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If DeepSeek were to admit that it used H100s in its data center to train its models, it would be confessing to activity illegal under U.S. law, since the H100 has never been legally available in China and cannot even legally be purchased by Chinese-firm subsidiaries outside of China. Thus, if DeepSeek did engage in illegal activity, it would have an incentive to conceal this fact. This raises the question of whether DeepSeek lied in its publications when it claimed to have used H800 chips exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry analyst Ben Thompson has pointed to strong evidence that DeepSeek did in fact use H800s as it claimed: Many of DeepSeek’s algorithmic and architectural improvements are ideal for maximizing the effective use of computing resources under conditions of limited interconnect bandwidth. At a minimum, this strongly suggests that DeepSeek uses many H800s in its computing infrastructure and that a model with the performance of V3 can indeed be trained exclusively on H800s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not prove, however, that DeepSeek exclusively uses H800s in its overall computing infrastructure. Indeed, some reporting in Chinese news media claims that DeepSeek did train its slightly more recent R1 model on Nvidia H100 chips that are banned from China under U.S. export controls. The semiconductor consulting firm SemiAnalysis, citing anonymous industry sources, recently wrote that DeepSeek has a total of 50,000 Hopper generation GPUs, a category that includes H100s, H800s, and H20s. SemiAnalysis specifically claimed that it has evidence that High-Flyer’s/DeepSeek’s computing infrastructure includes at least 10,000 H100s, 10,000 H800s, 30,000 H20s, and 10,000 A100s as part of its total computing stack. SemiAnalysis further estimated that High-Flyer/DeepSeek spent $1.63 billion in GPU server capital expenditures alone (i.e., excluding other data center construction and operating costs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nathan Lambert, a machine learning researcher at the Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence, has correctly pointed out that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tracking the compute used for a project just off the final pretraining run is a very unhelpful way to estimate actual cost. It’s a very useful measure for understanding the actual utilization of the compute and the efficiency of the underlying learning, but assigning a cost to the model based on the market price for the GPUs used for the final run is deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, it is not DeepSeek that is being deceptive, however, since their paper was extremely clear about what was and was not included in the $5.6 million figure. It was only the final, successful pretraining run. It did not include the compute cost of the hundreds of experiments that were run beforehand to generate the insights necessary for that final run, nor did it include the compute costs associated with post-training fine-tuning or inference compute workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no public evidence that large-scale Nvidia chip smuggling occurred prior to October 2023, industry sources told CSIS that, by early 2024, large-scale H100 chip smuggling operations were underway. In mid-2024, journalists at The Information interviewed participants in eight distinct H100 smuggling networks, each of which provided evidence that they had completed Chinese transactions worth more than $100 million. These networks continue to be active, with increasingly sophisticated techniques for evading detection. For example, a December 2024 investigation by The Information found that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When notified of an upcoming inspection, smugglers have duplicated the serial numbers of the servers with Nvidia chips they’ve purchased from Supermicro [and already smuggled to China] and attached them to other servers they had access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some evidence that governments are becoming more serious about cracking down on AI chip smuggling. Singapore was the billing location for 18 percent of Nvidia’s revenue in the most recently concluded fiscal year but the shipping location for only 2 percent of revenue. Officials in Singapore recently arrested three individuals accused of facilitating AI chip smuggling to China. The Singaporean government’s increased emphasis on cracking down on smuggling may reflect its concerns about being relegated to tier 2 status under the Biden administration’s AI Diffusion Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-however-deepseeks-challenges-also-reflect-the-successes-of-the-ai-chip-export-control-policy-which-deepseeks-ceo-has-described-as-the-greatest-challenge-facing-his-company-and-the-wider-chinese-ai-ecosystem&quot;&gt;5. However, DeepSeek’s challenges also reflect the successes of the AI chip export control policy, which DeepSeek’s CEO has described as the greatest challenge facing his company and the wider Chinese AI ecosystem.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the introduction of Huawei’s Mate60 Pro 5G smartphone in August 2023, many commentators were quick to highlight how DeepSeek reflected the failure of U.S. export controls. This included Chinese state-owned media, one outlet of which, GlobalVision, broadcast that “DeepSeek and Huawei join forces! . . . breaking through U.S. tech restrictions is not impossible!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angela Zhang, a professor at the Gould School of Law, went further, arguing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s achievements in efficiency are no accident. They are a direct response to the escalating export restrictions imposed by the US and its allies. By limiting China’s access to advanced AI chips, the US has inadvertently spurred its innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This argument is in one sense true: Chinese firms like DeepSeek prioritized innovation in efficiency—and particularly efficiency innovations that are useful given the limitations of the H800—because that was the most attractive AI research path available to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this argument is deeply flawed for three reasons. First, every leading AI firm, including both U.S. and Chinese ones, is pursuing enhanced efficiency. As mentioned above, DeepSeek’s efficiency improvements represented a continuation of preexisting industry trends in AI computation efficiency improvements, not a drastic acceleration of them. Even before DeepSeek was founded, and even before the U.S. imposed export controls, DeepSeek’s parent company was obsessively focused on improving computing efficiency (though more focused on optimizing latency). It is strange to say that export controls caused AI firms to do something that they—both U.S. and Chinese—were already doing (and already had a massive financial incentive to do) before export controls were imposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the argument is flawed because it does not engage with the question of “how much further along might China be in the absence of export controls?” The largest AI computing cluster currently operating on Earth is xAI’s Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, which was recently upgraded to use 200,000 H100 chips. Given that leading Chinese firms were already producing more AI-related patents, publishing nearly as many highly cited research papers, and spending nearly as much on data center capital expenditures before the export controls went into effect, it is entirely possible that China would already be ahead of the United States in AI in the absence of export controls. Jimmy Goodrich, a non-resident senior associate at the Wadhwani AI Center, put it well when he said, “It’s been long known that DeepSeek has a really good team, and if they had access to even more compute, God knows how capable they would be.” Goodrich’s statement on DeepSeek applies to China as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, this argument does not take account of the benefits of reallocating the supply of high-performance chips that would otherwise have gone to China. Nvidia, which is estimated to have 90 percent global market share in AI chips, is supply constrained, not demand constrained. For every Nvidia chip that TSMC has been able to manufacture since 2022, there are many customers willing to buy them. Larry Ellison, the cofounder of Oracle, colorfully described how Nvidia’s customers have to beg for greater chip allocation in September 2024 when he recounted a dinner between himself, xAI CEO Elon Musk, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would describe the dinner as Oracle—me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs, [saying] “Please take our money. Please take our money. By the way, I got dinner. No, no, take more of it. We need you to take more of our money please.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that, since the AI chip shortage began in 2022, all the chips that Nvidia would have sold to China in the absence of export controls would have come at the expense of customers elsewhere, which in this case is overwhelmingly the United States. In other words, eliminating the export controls would have not only helped China, it would have also hurt the United States, at least in terms of Nvidia chip allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For his part, DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng is under no illusions that the chip export controls have helped China or DeepSeek. In a July 2024 interview, he said, “We do not have financing plans in the short term. Money has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem.” Liang has also said in an interview with a Chinese media outlet that U.S. restrictions on AI chips mean that Chinese companies must use two to four times the computing power to achieve the same results, referring to the penalty of using the H800 instead of the H100 for large model training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further evidence of the impact of U.S. export controls comes from the fact that DeepSeek experienced widespread outages and had to halt new user sign-ups in the wake of its massive user adoption growth. While DeepSeek claimed that the outages were the result of cyberattacks, the far more likely explanation is that they simply lacked sufficient computing capacity to serve their growing user base. There is a big difference between the amount of computing power required to serve an AI large language model to a small number of users and doing what OpenAI does, which is serve its AI models to 400 million active users every week. More recently, DeepSeek has once again reopened new user sign-ups, which likely reflects the company successfully purchasing or renting additional computing capacity. Nevertheless, the point remains: Compute capacity matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-deepseeks-discovery-of-techniques-for-increased-ai-computational-efficiency-could-benefit-us-firms-more-than-chinese-ones-as-us-firms-can-apply-such-techniques-to-their-much-larger-computing-resources-and-thus-deliver-better-ai-to-more-customers&quot;&gt;6. DeepSeek’s discovery of techniques for increased AI computational efficiency could benefit U.S. firms more than Chinese ones, as U.S. firms can apply such techniques to their much larger computing resources and thus deliver better AI to more customers.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In describing its goals toward creating AGI, a recent DeepSeek job advertisement said that “We believe AGI is the violent beauty of model x data x computing power.” Though a bit oversimplified, that formula is still essentially correct and helps explain why having larger computing resources is a useful advantage at any level of computational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of DeepSeek’s innovations were algorithmic and architectural. DeepSeek appears to have described all or nearly all of them in great detail in its research papers. That means that U.S. AI labs are free to apply these same innovations in training and deploying their own AI models. Indeed, U.S. firms are already doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while DeepSeek’s algorithmic innovations are replicable by U.S. firms, DeepSeek will struggle to replicate U.S. AI chip and compute advantages. In the absence of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology, China’s most advanced AI chip designer and logic chip manufacturer, Huawei and SMIC, respectively, will most likely remain stuck at 7 nanometers (nm) or perhaps a flawed 5 nm technology node for many years. The CEO of ASML, which is the sole firm in the world manufacturing EUV lithography machines, said “By banning the export of EUV, China will lag 10 to 15 years behind the West. That really has an effect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, U.S. chip firms such as Nvidia will in coming years press forward past the 4 nm era into the 2 nm and beyond future, delivering chips that might be thousands or tens of thousands of times better performing integrated into data centers using tens or hundreds of times more chips. While there are still many ways in which the U.S. government could bungle export control implementation and enforcement—which will be discussed later in this paper—the greatest potential for impacts from the export controls are still well ahead in the future as the United States races forward and China’s progress continues to slow. Implemented properly, they offer the opportunity for a meaningful, though far from permanent, edge over China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-just-as-the-past-six-decades-of-moores-law-have-driven-increased-demand-for-computer-chips-deepseek-and-other-ai-efficiency-innovations-will-continue-to-do-the-same-for-ai-chips-there-is-no-ceiling-on-the-demand-for-intelligence&quot;&gt;7. Just as the past six decades of Moore’s Law have driven increased demand for computer chips, DeepSeek and other AI efficiency innovations will continue to do the same for AI chips. There is no ceiling on the demand for intelligence.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the initial commentary on DeepSeek suggested that demand for AI chips might plummet, as efficiency improvements meant that fewer chips were needed to achieve the same level of intelligence. While this is a generally accurate description of efficiency, it is a terrible description of how computing economics works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Moore’s Law has driven a more than billionfold improvement in computing efficiency over the past seven decades. Does this mean that all of the world’s computing needs are handled by a single computer that costs only a fraction of a penny? Of course not. Instead, the increased efficiency has made applying digital computation throughout the economy far more attractive, and so more governments, businesses, and consumers have invested in more computation across countless applications and use cases. This is the essence of Jevon’s Paradox, which describes how increasing efficiency can increase aggregate demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is obviously going to be true of increased AI computational efficiency. Indeed, after the DeepSeek revelations, the largest data center buyers in the world—Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon—announced that they were going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in 2025 on AI chips and data centers, up by nearly 50 percent over the already record amount invested in 2024. Chinese firms such as Alibaba have announced that they too will make massive chip purchases in the wake of DeepSeek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor is this merely a long-term phenomenon. Even in the short term, rental prices for H100 chips hosted by Amazon’s cloud computing spiked upward in the wake of DeepSeek’s publication as customers worked to incorporate DeepSeek models into their operations. More recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that OpenAI would have to temporarily limit usage of its GPT 4.5 model because the company did not have sufficient GPUs to meet all of the demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is almost certainly no “ceiling” for a desirable amount of intelligence and the computing required to power that intelligence. Miles Brundage, who previously led policy research at OpenAI, described it this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To make a human-AI analogy, consider [Albert] Einstein or John von Neumann as the smartest possible person you could fit in a human brain. You would still want more of them. You’d want more copies. That’s basically what inference compute or test-time compute is—copying the smart thing. It’s better to have an hour of Einstein’s time than a minute, and I don’t see why that wouldn’t be true for AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This again relates to how the most significant impacts of the export controls are likely in the future, as the evermore extremely scaled deployment of evermore powerful chips begins to bear fruit. It is the next few rounds of increasing AI computation—by tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold—where China will be most severely blocked and the impact of the export controls will be most severely felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Chinese AI researchers have made similar points. On February 13, 2025, Li Guojie, a scholar at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, told Chinese media outlet ChinaFund that DeepSeek’s success represents a step-change in Chinese AI capabilities but said that “due to the blockade of the U.S. government, China is currently unable to obtain the most advanced chip process technology.” Li went on to say [machine translation]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The success of DeepSeek does not deny the key role of computing power in the development of artificial intelligence. In fact, since there are much more equipment for reasoning than for training, the computing power required for reasoning [aka inference] will become the main requirement in the future. It is very important to improve the efficiency of the model through algorithm optimization. It is our basic choice to take the green development path of saving computing power, but computing power is definitely a necessary condition for solving artificial intelligence problems and cannot be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

DeepSeek’s success in distilling U.S. AI models and replicating closed source algorithmic innovations does raise strategic questions about the nature of competitive advantage in AI in the absence of strong intellectual property protections. A worst-case scenario would be if AI is structurally similar to pharmaceuticals.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 29, OpenAI told the New York Times that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We know that groups in the P.R.C. are actively working to use methods, including what’s known as distillation, to replicate advanced U.S. A.I. models. . . . We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distillation is a well-known technique that allows “the transfer of knowledge from a larger, more complex language model (the ‘teacher’) to a smaller, more efficient version (the ‘student’).” In short, the inputs and outputs from the teacher model are used as very high-quality synthetic training data by the student model. Distillation is utilized by every major U.S. AI lab to offer smaller, more efficient versions of its models that are faster and cheaper to serve to customers. For example, GPT-4o-mini is the distilled version of GPT-4o, and both were made by OpenAI. There are multiple types of distillation, however, and the more advanced types, which AI labs use to distill their own models, require access to the internals of the models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a firm distilling its own models is clearly harmless, there is a strategic consideration if one firm can distill another firm’s models, incurring most or all of the benefits of acquiring a highly capable AI model while incurring far fewer of the costs of creating such a model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of OpenAI and DeepSeek, the distillation evidence appears quite strong: DeepSeek’s initially released models, when asked by users “what model are you?,” will often respond, “I’m ChatGPT.” DeepSeek’s updated versions of the model, likely modified using fine-tuning techniques, no longer produce such responses, but this does not reduce the strength of the evidence that DeepSeek relied on distillation. Such unauthorized distillation would be a violation of OpenAI’s terms of service, but the law firm Fenwick has written that “whether remedies against such [a Terms of Service] breach would sufficiently protect teacher-model owner’s IP remains to be determined.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If OpenAI were to file a lawsuit against DeepSeek, for example, perhaps it would win in U.S. courts. But how would the size of judicial penalties compare to the strategic benefit for DeepSeek as a firm or for China as a country? And the access to judicial remedies is almost certainly limited to the United States and other countries with strong intellectual property protections. Even if DeepSeek were hypothetically clearly guilty of not only distillation but an even more extreme case of outright corporate espionage, Chinese courts would likely find OpenAI guilty of stealing IP from DeepSeek rather than the reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what happened to U.S. chipmaker Micron when it accused China’s Fujian Jinhua of stealing memory chip trade secrets and when U.S. prosecutors charged Fujian Jinhua with economic espionage. In retaliation, Jinhua sued Micron in a Chinese court for patent infringement in early 2018. The Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court in Fujian province sided with the Chinese side and issued an injunction blocking Micron from selling 26 chip products in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when U.S. semiconductor equipment firm Veeco found that a Chinese competitor, Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC), was using Veeco’s proprietary designs, Veeco secured a preliminary injunction in a U.S. court to stop a supplier from providing parts to AMEC. However, in response, AMEC filed a patent suit in China, and the Fujian High Court (the same province as above) acted with remarkable speed. On December 7, 2017—just weeks after AMEC’s filing—the court granted AMEC a preliminary injunction without even hearing Veeco’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, one should separate the questions of what is “fair” or “true” from what the strategic consequences are likely to be. Neither geopolitics nor business is a contest where first prize always goes to the most innovative. Many companies, including U.S. tech companies, have a perfectly viable business strategy of closely monitoring their innovative competitors and then either buying the competitor or replicating its innovation. Chinese firms can do the same, including in ways that both do and do not violate intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the meaningful strategic question for OpenAI and other U.S. AI firms is not whether DeepSeek is failing to play by the rules, it is whether U.S. firms have a mechanism for effectively preventing DeepSeek or any competitor from extracting the benefits of an AI lab’s investments without bearing the costs. What enduring sources of competitive advantages could the large U.S. AI labs secure if Chinese companies or other copycats (potentially even U.S. ones) can simply piggyback off their work to build cheaper and equivalently good models while incurring only a fraction of the costs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible answer comes in the form of Meta’s strategy, which is to invest in developing open-source AI models justified not by the direct benefits of increasing monthly subscriptions, but by the indirect benefits of enhancing their existing social media and advertising business lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the worst outcomes for U.S. AI companies would be if the fundamentals of AI research and development were structurally similar to those of the global pharmaceutical industry. In 2023, the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies invested approximately $2.4 billion over 10 to 15 years into developing a typical new drug from start to finish. The costs of research and development dwarf those of drug manufacturing, marketing, and distribution, so the final price of the product must reflect the costs of research and development for pharmaceutical firms to have any hope of recovering their investments and earning a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To incentivize drug R&amp;amp;D, the U.S. government offers companies 20-year patents that allow them the exclusive right to sell their products in the United States at a monopoly premium to recover upfront R&amp;amp;D costs. However, once a patent expires, so-called generic manufacturers can reproduce and sell the same drug for a far lower price—avoiding the burden of R&amp;amp;D costs altogether. Generic manufacturers can thereafter compete by selling identical drugs while incurring only a tiny fraction of the costs faced by the original drug developer. In a world where there was no patent protection on new pharmaceuticals, investment in new drug discovery (and thus the pace of innovative new drugs) would be radically limited because governments and philanthropic actors might be the only ones willing to invest, and they would almost certainly do so at far lower levels than the current private sector does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government and business-makers alike must now ask the question: What if frontier AI model research is structurally identical to that of the pharmaceutical industry, meaning extremely high upfront R&amp;amp;D costs and very low replication costs? The implications for AI investment and for U.S.-China AI competition could be significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-China AI race is very likely not one in which gentlemanly concepts of “fairness” matter. Chinese companies have systematicallystolen American IP for years and will almost certainly continue to do so. Beyond Chinese firms, the Chinese government has a very clear history of either not enforcing or outright supporting Chinese firms that illegally violate U.S. patents in cases where the Chinese government has identified the industry as strategically significant. AI certainly falls into that category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kai-Fu Lee, arguably the top venture capitalist in China’s AI sector, wrote in his 2018 book AI Superpowers that imitation does not have the same stigma in China that it does in the United States. He went further to argue that China’s unabashed willingness to copy innovation and even ignore intellectual property makes its companies more competitive, not less. In describing the post-2010 rise of hypercompetitive and cutthroat Chinese tech firms as “copycat gladiators,” Lee’s writing on this topic is worth quoting at length:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley may have found the copying undignified and the tactics unsavory. In many cases, it was. But it was precisely this widespread cloning—the onslaught of thousands of mimicking competitors—that forced companies to innovate. Survival in the internet coliseum required relentlessly iterating products, controlling costs, executing flawlessly, generating positive PR [public relations], raising money at exaggerated valuations, and seeking ways to build a robust business ‘moat’ to keep the copycats out. Pure copycats never made for great companies, and they couldn’t survive inside this coliseum. But the trial-by-fire competitive landscape created when one is surrounded by ruthless copycats had the result of forging a generation of the most tenacious entrepreneurs on earth. As we enter the age of AI implementation, this cutthroat entrepreneurial environment will be one of China’s core assets in building a machine-learning-driven economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking Lee’s argument one step further: If the future global competitive landscape for AI is one of ruthless copying in the absence of robust intellectual property protections, that is an environment where Chinese entrepreneurs ought to do extremely well, because it resembles the domestic Chinese tech ecosystem in which they grew up and thrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;9-unfortunately-developments-in-recent-years-do-not-give-confidence-that-traditional-approaches-to-protecting-intellectual-property-and-technology-secrets-are-likely-to-be-effective-when-it-comes-to-china-and-ai&quot;&gt;9. Unfortunately, developments in recent years do not give confidence that traditional approaches to protecting intellectual property and technology secrets are likely to be effective when it comes to China and AI.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even over just the past three years, a diverse set of examples suggests that robustly protecting key knowledge in the AI field is likely to be extremely difficult:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 2025, a federal grand jury charged a Chinese national and former Google employee with “seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets in connection with an alleged plan to steal from Google LLC (Google) proprietary information related to AI technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 2023, ASML, the most important provider of the lithography equipment used to manufacture advanced chips, accused a former employee in China of stealing proprietary technology data in an attempt to circumvent export controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In January 2025, Eindhoven University of Technology, a school only five miles away from ASML’s headquarters and with close ties to the company, had to suspend all activities as it worked to analyze the impact of a Chinese cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, WIRED reported that a group of cyber criminals breached Nvidia and stole “a significant amount of sensitive information about the designs of Nvidia graphics cards, source code for an Nvidia AI rendering system called DLSS, and the usernames and passwords of more than 71,000 Nvidia employees.” Nvidia claims to have since significantly upgraded its cybersecurity, and this particular attack does not seem to have originated in China. However, it is concerning that a hacking group got so close to the technology crown jewels of such an important U.S. AI company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Chinese intelligence services successfully hacked the email accounts of then-Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and other U.S. officials, apparently looking for intelligence related to U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2025, The Information reported that DeepSeek CEO Liang had visited San Francisco in mid-2024 and “met with researchers he knows, including some OpenAI employees, to stay up to date.” This is consistent with Center for AI Safety Director Dan Hendrycks’ claim that&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you know which research dead ends to avoid (e.g., MCTS) and roughly know what research direction to pursue, replication is much easier. These algorithmic insights likely slowly leaked through SF party conversations and other channels. It probably takes a few months once you have the idea for [OpenAI’s reasoning AI model] o1 to replicate it. That’s how DeepSeek did it without much compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is ongoing research into techniques to prevent model distillation, and AI companies will no doubt increase these efforts in the wake of DeepSeek, this remains an open question with significant implications. In an interview published in ChinaTalk, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like all problems in cybersecurity . . . [distillation is] going to be an ongoing issue. That’s why some companies have chosen to kind of hide the chain of thought in their reasoning models, because it makes it much harder to distill. Those can be jailbroken. But folks are working on antidotes to jailbreaking. We just released something today that makes it much harder to jailbreak models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in a case where distillation and more explicit cases of technological espionage are difficult or impossible to prevent, however, there will remain the issue inference computation, which involves applying more computational resources so that the model can “think” harder about the answer to a question or so that the model can be used more times and serve more users. One way of thinking about this is that the nature of competitive advantage in AI could be shifting from a secret that one keeps (i.e., the model weights) toward an asset that one controls (i.e., massive data center compute infrastructure). This means that export controls—if implemented and enforced effectively—still have an opportunity to have a strategic impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the U.S. government and U.S. AI firms need to take a tough look at whether and how they can remain competitive in a world where China does not respect intellectual property and is committed to devoting enormous state resources to technical espionage in the AI and semiconductor sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;10-the-effectiveness-of-export-controls-will-depend-upon-effective-implementation-and-enforcement-to-prevent-chip-smuggling-there-is-cause-for-significant-concern-on-this-point-if-the-trump-administration-reduces-relevant-government-resources-and-staff-or-causes-allied-countries-to-not-cooperate&quot;&gt;10. The effectiveness of export controls will depend upon effective implementation and enforcement to prevent chip smuggling. There is cause for significant concern on this point if the Trump administration reduces relevant government resources and staff or causes allied countries to not cooperate.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) at the U.S. Department of Commerce is the agency charged with adjudicating license applications and enforcing export controls, not just on semiconductors bound for China, but for all U.S. dual-use technology exports that might end up in Russia, Iran, North Korea, and many other restricted destinations. To implement its work overseeing trillions of dollars in economic activity and policing smuggling operations worldwide, BIS has fewer than 600 employees and a relatively paltry budget of just under $200 million. Semiconductors are just one technology category out of hundreds that this organization is responsible for enforcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting by The Information found at least eight Chinese AI chip–smuggling networks, with each engaging in transactions valued at more than $100 million. More recent reporting by the Wall Street Journal suggests that this smuggling now includes the latest generation of Nvidia Blackwell AI chips. China is betting that its network of smugglers and shell companies can find the leaks in the BIS export control enforcement barrier. As long as Congress continues to neglect BIS by providing grossly inadequate resources compared to the size and importance of its mission, China has a reasonable expectation of success. BIS needs not only more money, but also more skilled staff, more enforcement agents, and better enabling technology, especially in data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Department of Commerce needs more help from the rest of the government, in particular the U.S. intelligence community. Declassified Central Intelligence Agency documents show that the intelligence community was deeply involved in assisting export control enforcement during the Cold War and delivered solid results by doing so. These are capabilities and priorities that have significantly atrophied in the post–Cold War era but urgently need to be restored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent efforts by the Trump administration to reduce government spending risk making a bad situation worse. On February 5, 2025, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi signed a Department of Justice memorandum that, among many other actions, disbanded the National Security Division’s Corporate Enforcement Unit, which was “created with the goal of investigating and prosecuting corporate actors involved in sanctions evasion, export control violations, and other national security-related economic crimes.” The memo did not provide any explanation for how the duties of the unit would be performed elsewhere in the Department of Justice, which could mean that this will be implemented as a straightforward reduction in U.S. government capacity to enforce export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the choices available, the worst policy choice that the U.S. government could make is to regulate aggressively but with large loopholes and weak enforcement. Such an approach—which fairly describes the approach taken in the first Trump administration and large chunks of the Biden administration—incurs nearly all the costs of an aggressive export control policy but does so without providing any of the possible strategic benefits in terms of slowing Chinese progress in semiconductors and AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-beyond-smuggling-the-greatest-strategic-challenge-for-the-united-states-is-the-potential-for-china-to-produce-ai-chips-domestically-at-sufficient-quantity-and-quality-to-build-ai-data-center-infrastructure-that-is-competitive-with-the-united-states&quot;&gt;11. Beyond smuggling, the greatest strategic challenge for the United States is the potential for China to produce AI chips domestically at sufficient quantity and quality to build AI data center infrastructure that is competitive with the United States.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described above, the nature of AI geopolitical advantage appears to be moving away from software secrets that are difficult to protect and toward hardware chip and data center assets that are (hopefully) easier to protect. In this sense, DeepSeek is not in and of itself the most significant threat to U.S. leadership in AI. Instead, the greater challenge arises from the possibility of China having a domestic ecosystem for producing its own AI chips at large scale and integrating them into Chinese data center training, as well as running inference for DeepSeek and other AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As U.S. technology firms are planning hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data center infrastructure investments, it is worth remembering that—for those investments to be possible—companies like TSMC must manufacture enough AI chips to fill those data centers. In the case of companies such as Nvidia, their revenue growth in recent years is less than it would have otherwise been due to shortages of TSMC production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration took many steps designed to definitively cut China’s AI chip designers off from TSMC production capacity. Most recently, on January 15, the Commerce Department announced the final tranche of Biden administration export controls, often referred to as “the Foundry Rule.” The Foundry Rule moved advanced chip production to a white-list system that will likely make it impossible for Chinese AI firms to access TSMC capacity to produce chips above export control performance thresholds even when operating through complex shell company arrangements. However, as discussed below, TSMC manufactured a strategically significant quantity of chips on behalf of Huawei via shell companies prior to the rule going into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That effectively means that China’s long-term future in AI is closely tied to its ability to produce AI chips domestically. The Biden administration sought to hamstring China’s domestic production of advanced chips by restricting the sale of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;12-deepseek-stands-out-among-chinese-ai-model-developers-because-of-its-demonstrated-ability-to-make-architectural-innovations-below-the-level-of-nvidias-cuda-software-ecosystem-if-deepseek-were-devoted-to-strengthening-huaweis-ascend-chips-and-cann-software-ecosystem-it-would-pose-a-much-more-significant-threat-to-nvidia&quot;&gt;12. DeepSeek stands out among Chinese AI model developers because of its demonstrated ability to make architectural innovations below the level of Nvidia’s CUDA software ecosystem. If DeepSeek were devoted to strengthening Huawei’s Ascend chips and CANN software ecosystem, it would pose a much more significant threat to Nvidia.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, one of the biggest sources of competitive advantage for Nvidia has been its CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software ecosystem. CUDA makes it much easier for programmers to write massively parallelized software (as all modern AI software is) and ensures backward and forward compatibility so that older chips can still run newer software and vice versa. Any customer who seeks to stop using Nvidia chips has to leave the CUDA ecosystem, which requires solving a lot of incredibly hard software problems for which CUDA already provides free answers. Those free answers reflect billions of dollars of investment in the CUDA platform by both Nvidia and its customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek stands out among AI model developers because it implemented software changes below the CUDA level. Most AI researchers rely on CUDA, a higher-level programming language for NVIDIA GPUs, because it simplifies the development process. However, CUDA does not allow fine-grained control over GPU operations at the level DeepSeek required. DeepSeek modified software instructions written in a language called PTX (Parallel Thread Execution). By programming directly in PTX, DeepSeek engineers were able to optimize how the GPU handled specific workloads, particularly in managing expert specialization in the Mixture-of-Experts model and improving memory efficiency. This is an “assembly-level” approach to GPU programming—one that is both extremely difficult and (at least historically) rarely attempted. The trade-off, however, was a major increase in performance efficiency, particularly for large-scale AI training tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that DeepSeek may have both the technical knowledge and the open-source community enthusiasm to finally start generating momentum around Huawei’s competitor to CUDA, which Huawei refers to as its Compute Architecture for Neural Networks (CANN). The greater maturity of the CUDA software ecosystem currently makes Nvidia chips more attractive, but this could change over the next few years. If it does, it would have major implications for Nvidia’s competitiveness both inside and outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, the combination of Ascend chips (discussed more below) and CANN software appears far from being competitive to CUDA. A Financial Times report from September 2024 found that even Huawei employees found the product “difficult and unstable to use” and prone to crashing frequently. Industry sources told CSIS that DeepSeek’s more recent evaluation of CANN was very negative and that DeepSeek assessed that it would be years before the combination of Ascend chips and CANN-compatible software was a viable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, this could change with time, effort, and investment. Huawei recently joined the open-source PyTorch foundation in an effort to increase Ascend and CANN compatibility of the PyTorch AI development framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is at least one meaningful precedent regarding the difficulty of leaving the Nvidia CUDA ecosystem, which is Google’s shift from TensorFlow on Nvidia GPUs to JAX on their proprietary chips, called TPUs. In this case, it took several years for JAX to mature and for a critical mass of software libraries to appear—even with heavy Google investment and the payoff opportunity in terms of both efficiency and competitive differentiation. Even by 2023, Google was still heavily investing to improve JAX (for example, addressing pain points like multi-host setup and memory efficiency) and encouraging its use through education (tutorials, conference workshops). For a company like DeepSeek, migrating all AI workloads from CUDA to CANN would likely be a multiyear project. Google’s internal shift took 2–3 years to bear significant fruit, and even then Google maintained support for both for a long while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;13-chinas-alliance-of-huawei-ai-chip-designer-smic-ai-chip-manufacturer-and-cxmtxmc-high-bandwidth-memory-manufacturers-have-recently-made-strategically-significant-progress-in-advancing-domestic-production-of-ai-chips&quot;&gt;13. China’s alliance of Huawei (AI chip designer), SMIC (AI chip manufacturer), and CXMT/XMC (high-bandwidth memory manufacturers) have recently made strategically significant progress in advancing domestic production of AI chips.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically producing large quantities of AI chips will require China to domestically replicate multiple segments of the AI chip value chain. The most important links are AI chip design, advanced node logic chip manufacturing, and advanced node high-bandwidth memory (HBM) manufacturing. Each of these will be addressed in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;14-huaweis-ai-chip-design-has-long-been-strong-before-the-2020-export-controls-it-was-poised-to-meaningfully-challenge-nvidia-in-china-with-tsmc-manufacturing-and-chinese-government-pressure-to-purchase-huawei-products-over-nvidia-ones&quot;&gt;14. Huawei’s AI Chip design has long been strong. Before the 2020 export controls, it was poised to meaningfully challenge Nvidia in China with TSMC manufacturing and Chinese government pressure to purchase Huawei products over Nvidia ones.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the United States, China has many different companies working on AI chip design, including Huawei, Cambricon, Biren, and more. However, Huawei is unambiguously in the strongest position with its Ascend AI chip product line. Industry sources also told CSIS that Huawei—due to its highly influential position with the Chinese government and its size as a customer—has the greatest leverage over SMIC. In other words, even if Huawei were not the best AI chip designer in China, it would still be the most important since it is in a position to restrict the share of SMIC manufacturing capacity that goes toward its domestic competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei has been a player in the AI chip market for longer than is generally realized. Huawei had a 7 nm AI Accelerator chip planned for production at TSMC in 2020. At the time, Huawei was preparing to capitalize the so-called 3-5-2 policy, in which the CCP’s Central Office ordered all government agencies and many state-owned enterprises to eliminate the use of all non-Chinese technology within three years. However, Huawei was unable to fulfill demand because of the first Trump administration’s updated 2020 entity listing, which temporarily cut Huawei’s Ascend and Kirin lines off from TSMC. In this instance, Nvidia was the beneficiary of these early U.S. export controls, which delivered a setback to Chinese efforts to eliminate dependence on U.S. AI chip technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Huawei’s Ascend product line is focused on the Ascend 910B and the Ascend 910C, the latter of which includes two Ascend 910B logic dies per integrated unit (meaning more real estate on each silicon wafer is required for manufacturing an Ascend 910C than a 910B). DeepSeek has reportedly evaluated the Ascend chips and found that they are unattractive for training AI models but that each Ascend 910C delivers roughly 60 percent of the performance of an Nvidia H100 for inferencing AI models. This matters greatly since more and more of the computing requirements for advanced AI models are expected to be devoted to inference in the coming years. Barclays, an investment bank, estimates that by 2026, 70 percent of AI compute demand will come from inference. In February 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that utilization of its chips was “40 percent inference, 60 percent training,” compared to 90 percent training-focused in the 2016 timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;15-sources-told-csis-that-huaweis-use-of-shell-companies-to-gain-access-to-tsmc-manufacturing-capacity-allowed-them-to-acquire-more-than-2-million-ai-chip-dies-and-that-huawei-has-also-stockpiled-more-than-a-years-worth-of-hbm&quot;&gt;15. Sources told CSIS that Huawei’s use of shell companies to gain access to TSMC manufacturing capacity allowed them to acquire more than 2 million AI chip dies and that Huawei has also stockpiled more than a year’s worth of HBM.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese firms like Huawei have historically had two major options for manufacturing their AI chip designs: outsource production abroad to TSMC of Taiwan or produce chips domestically in partnership with SMIC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a time, it seemed as though the 2020 entity listing of Huawei definitively cut the company off from accessing TSMC advanced node manufacturing capacity. The October 2022 and October 2023 export controls were supposed to have done the same for all advanced node AI chip designers in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, TSMC manufactured large quantities of Huawei Ascend 910B chips on behalf of Huawei shell companies and shipped the chips to China in violation of U.S. export controls. In an interview with the New York Times, an unnamed Taiwanese official acknowledged that these chips “ended up in the hands of Huawei.” Government officials told CSIS that TSMC manufactured more than 2 million Ascend 910B logic dies and that all of these are now with Huawei. If true, this is enough dies to make 1 million Ascend 910C units. However, the advanced packaging process by which two Ascend 910B dies and HBM are combined into a unified Ascend 910C chip also introduces defects that can compromise the functionality of the chip. Industry sources told CSIS that roughly 75 percent of the Ascend 910Cs currently survive the advanced packaging process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a strategically significant stockpile of AI chips. For comparison, Nvidia reportedly shipped 1 million H20 chips (which are inference specialized and targeted at the Chinese market) to China in 2024. Nvidia’s January 26 SEC filing states that it generated $17 billion in revenues from Chinese customers in the most recently ended fiscal year (which would obviously exclude revenues from chips later smuggled to China). Presumably, the vast majority of these revenues are from H20 sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Huawei likely has the more than 2 million Ascend 910B logic dies made by TSMC, there is a question as to whether it has enough HBM to integrate with those dies in manufacturing 1 million Ascend 910Cs. It seems likely that Huawei does, however, since the U.S. plan to restrict all advanced HBM sales to China on a country-wide basis was leaked to Bloomberg in August 2024 and did not go into effect until December of that year, giving Huawei ample time to legally acquire HBM chips as part of a stockpiling strategy. Industry sources told CSIS that Huawei has stockpiled enough HBM to meet their internal expectations for at least a full year’s worth of production, mostly in the form of purchases from Samsung of South Korea, potentially via shell companies, that occurred before the December controls went into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is as though the U.S. government was having an internal debate about whether or not to have a surprise attack, and in the spirit of compromise, the slow interagency process settled on attacking without the surprise. This was an egregious failure with strategic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the adoption of the Foundry Rule, it will hopefully be impossible for Huawei or other Chinese AI chip designers to ever again access TSMC manufacturing capacity, even when using sophisticated shell company tactics. Huawei will instead be restricted to what Chinese domestic logic chip manufacturers can produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is also the potential risk that an existing chip design company on the Foundry Rule white list could be tempted by massive revenue opportunities to act as a pass-through to give Huawei access to TSMC. Guarding against this risk will require making clear to TSMC that the negative consequences of continuing to supply Huawei with advanced AI chips would be colossal compared to the revenue and profit opportunity. Similarly, Huawei may attempt similar tactics with other chip foundries such as Samsung or even Intel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;16-huaweis-ai-chip-manufacturing-partner-smic-has-been-struggling-with-low-production-yield-20-percent-and-20000-7-nm-monthly-wafer-production-due-to-us-and-allied-export-controls-smic-has-a-difficult-and-uncertain-path-toward-producing-at-nodes-more-advanced-than-7-nm&quot;&gt;16. Huawei’s AI chip manufacturing partner, SMIC, has been struggling with low production yield (~20 percent) and 20,000 7 nm monthly wafer production due to U.S. and allied export controls. SMIC has a difficult and uncertain path toward producing at nodes more advanced than 7 nm.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most advanced logic chip manufacturer in China is SMIC. SMIC’s SN2 facility in Shanghai is the sole facility in China with an active 7 nm logic chip production line and has been producing 7 nm chips since July 2021, more than a year before the first tranche of the Biden administration’s semiconductor equipment export controls went into effect. SMIC and Huawei are now working to bring a 5 nm node into scaled production but must do so without access to EUV lithography equipment, since China has no local producer of EUV lithography machines and since export controls have prevented such machines from ever being exported to China. Industry sources told CSIS that, in early 2020, ASML was poised to ship EUV tools to China and that SMIC was planning to work with key research labs in Europe, such as the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC), to help develop their EUV-based manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, industry sources told CSIS that SMIC currently has enough immersion deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography equipment supplied by the Dutch company ASML to produce 85,000 FinFET wafers per month (WPM) across both SN1 (which focuses on 14 nm node production) and SN2 (which focuses on 7 nm and 5 nm production). This acquisition of lithography tools reportedly took effect before Dutch DUV lithography export controls went into effect in mid-2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the bottleneck in expanding 7 nm (which in SMIC’s node naming system is called “N+2”) production capacity has not been lithography but rather U.S. tools for etching, deposition, inspection, and metrology. The shortage of inspection and metrology tools has also been an important factor preventing SMIC from improving its yield. SMIC acquired lithography equipment as a stockpiling measure in anticipation of future export controls by the Dutch government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low production rate also has an impact on yield, since manufacturing technicians and engineers tend to improve their techniques based on experimentation and observed results from production. Thus, more production is helpful in accelerating the pace of learning and thus improving the yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the Ascend 910B die size of 665.61 mm², CSIS estimates that each 300-millimeter diameter silicon wafer produces roughly 80 chip dies. This is simply counting the number of small rectangles (chip dies) that can fit inside the large circle (the wafer). A source told CSIS that of these 80 chip dies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roughly 20 percent (~16) are fully functional with either no defects or no defects that negatively impact performance. This is the same as saying that SMIC has 20 percent yield when making these chips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An unknown share of chips are functional with degraded performance, though customer demand for such degraded chips (in Huawei’s case, though not Nvidia’s) is low.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An unknown share of chips are completely nonfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMIC’s 20 percent yield when producing Ascend 910Bs is quite low, but it is not as low as it might seem. In 2020, when Nvidia moved its GPU production to TSMC’s 7 nm process, the defect-free yield rate was roughly 41.5 percent. Since manufacturing defects occur randomly on a defects per square centimeter of chip area basis, larger chips (such as AI chips) are more susceptible than smaller chips (such as smartphone application processors) to a high defect rate. Using TSMC during roughly the same time period and with roughly the same defect rate, Apple’s A12 processor enjoyed 90 percent+ yield. SMIC also makes the application processor for Huawei’s Mate smartphone line, and its yield when making these smaller chips is somewhere in the 50–70 percent range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a February 24, 2025 report by the Financial Times, citing two anonymous individuals, claims that SMIC’s AI chip yield has increased to roughly 40 percent. Industry sources told CSIS that the Financial Times report is not correct and that Huawei/SMIC’s true yield remains at 20 percent. One explanation for the discrepancy would be if the Financial Times’ sources were mistakenly including both the fully functional chips and the chips that are functional but with degraded performance when estimating yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;17-sources-told-csis-that-huawei-smics-most-important-customer-has-successfully-managed-to-move-stockpiled-us-built-equipment-from-sien-芯恩-pensun-鹏新旭-and-huaweis-fab-in-dongguan-to-smic-sn2&quot;&gt;17. Sources told CSIS that Huawei, SMIC’s most important customer, has successfully managed to move stockpiled U.S.-built equipment from SiEn (芯恩), Pensun (鹏新旭), and Huawei’s fab in Dongguan to SMIC SN2.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, SMIC’s shortage of deposition, etching, inspection, and metrology semiconductor manufacturing equipment also been an important factor preventing expanded production capacity of its SN2 facility. Some of this equipment is restricted on a country-wide basis, meaning that it cannot be legally sold anywhere in China. However, other types of this equipment were restricted only on an end-use and end-user basis. This means that the equipment can be sold to some customers in China but not others. In some cases, this even means that it can be sold to some facilities of a particular customer, but not others. In such cases, relocating the equipment from one facility to another would require a new export license in order to be legal. But SMIC’s production of 7 nm chips using U.S. equipment is already illegal, and both SMIC and other Chinese firms always have the option to choose illegal activity, particularly since such activity frequently enjoys the active support of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry sources told CSIS that SiEn, Pensun, and Huawei’s fab in Dongguan all were able to legally acquire the needed etching, deposition, and inspection/metrology equipment that SMIC needs for two reasons: (1) the equipment was not restricted on a country-wide basis to all of China and (2) the equipment was restricted on an end-use and end-user basis, but SiEn and Pensun told U.S. firms that it would exclusively be used for producing chips less advanced than 14 nm. These firms also denied any affiliation with Huawei. Government officials told CSIS that in such circumstances, the equipment can often be sold under a no-license required status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the sources, SiEn and Pensun, however, did not have sufficient customers providing demand for using all of the equipment they had purchased, and so some of it was never used operationally in their fabs. They purchased the equipment as a stockpiling move in anticipation of future export controls. The source described this as a “buy everything you can, while you can” strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SMIC SN2 facility needed the equipment. Since SiEn and Pensun were not making economically productive use of the equipment, they were amenable to a sale. This sale was negotiated in Q4 of 2024 and completed in Q1 of 2025. The sources are under the impression that all of the desired equipment is currently either installed at SMIC SN2 or on-site awaiting installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;18-as-a-result-of-the-successful-in-country-equipment-transfer-smic-expects-to-achieve-50000-7-nm-wpm-by-the-end-of-2025-if-all-of-this-capacity-was-devoted-to-manufacturing-ascend-ai-chips-which-is-unlikely-that-would-imply-the-production-of-millions-of-ascend-910c-chips-annually&quot;&gt;18. As a result of the successful in-country equipment transfer, SMIC expects to achieve 50,000 7 nm WPM by the end of 2025. If all of this capacity was devoted to manufacturing Ascend AI chips (which is unlikely), that would imply the production of millions of Ascend 910C chips annually.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This equipment will eliminate the near-term U.S. equipment bottleneck facing SMIC for SN2 7 nm production. SMIC’s new 7 nm production bottleneck is the overall size of the facility. Prior public statements from SMIC indicated that the SN1 and SN2 facilities combined have a maximum capacity of 85,000 WPM and that SMIC intended to split production evenly between the two facilities, implying SMIC was targeting ~42,500 WPM of lithography capacity at SN2. Sources told CSIS that SMIC was targeting 50,000 WPM of 7 nm specifically by the end of 2025. It is unclear whether this means that 7 nm production will now also take place at SN1 or whether SMIC has figured out a production process and equipment configuration that allows them to squeeze more production capacity than expected into SN2. If, hypothetically, SMIC were to devote all 50,000 WPM to Ascend 910C manufacturing, this would imply producing 4 million Ascend 910B dies per month, of which 800,000 would be fully functional. 800,000 910B Ascend dies is enough to manufacture 400,000 910C chips, though the advanced packaging process would reduce yield further, and it is unclear how much HBM Huawei has on hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMIC is unlikely to devote all of its 7 nm capacity to Ascend chips. Huawei needs that 7 nm capacity for its chips for smartphones, laptops, data centers, and telecommunications equipment. Moreover, SMIC has other customers besides Huawei. Still, the point remains that Huawei is likely poised to dramatically expand Ascend production in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, SMIC’s 7 nm yield will likely improve significantly above 20 percent due to the additional equipment and the increased production rate. It will likely not match the best TSMC 7 nm yields for AI chips, however, since TSMC’s best 7 nm yields used EUV, and China has no credible near-term path for acquiring EUV technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the mid and long term, however, Huawei is working aggressively to produce a domestic alternative to ASML EUV technology. Huawei currently has two semiconductor manufacturing equipment tool research facilities, one in Shanghai and one in Shenzhen. According to a report by Nikkei Asia, Huawei is investing $1.66 billion in the Shanghai facility alone and has hired a large number of chip industry veterans with experience working at companies like Applied Materials, Lam Research, KLA, ASML, TSMC, Intel, and Micron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taylor Ogan, a venture capitalist based in Shenzhen, China, focused on investing in Chinese technology companies, described Huawei’s EUV efforts as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are teams at Huawei in two different parts of China that are working around the clock. . . . They are literally cut off from their friends and family just because the work they are doing is so sensitive, and imagine how quickly they’re going to accelerate Chinese complete domestic chip development. . . . One of them is in Shenzhen. That’s the bigger [EUV lithography] breakthrough lab, and you can look on Google Earth. There was nothing there and now there is something there, and there are thousands of people working there. The other one is around Shanghai and that is more for the next chips in the next phones. So, yeah, the bigger lithography breakthroughs are [being worked on] in Shenzhen. . . . They’re working their asses off. . . . This is like some of the smartest people in the space, and they’re all Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, these secretive efforts underway at Huawei are extremely likely to be benefitting from state-backed industrial espionage, including the cyberattacks on ASML and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;19-huaweis-ascend-chips-continue-to-face-challenges-in-terms-of-a-lack-of-compatible-ai-software-that-is-driving-low-utilization-of-purchased-chips-however-this-could-change-if-deepseeks-open-source-community-enthusiasm-improves-huaweis-cann-software-ecosystem-competitiveness-with-nvidias-cuda&quot;&gt;19. Huawei’s Ascend chips continue to face challenges in terms of a lack of compatible AI software that is driving low utilization of purchased chips. However, this could change if DeepSeek’s open-source community enthusiasm improves Huawei’s CANN software ecosystem competitiveness with Nvidia’s CUDA.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-quality recent analysis by Nicholas Welch, Lily Ottinger, and Jordan Schneider of ChinaTalk concludes that China’s current compute shortage has more to do with practical challenges and suboptimal deployment—many idle small and medium data centers rather than fewer fully-utilized superclusters—than it does with an absolute shortage of chips. A combination of recent Chinese government policy changes, such as “hand[ing] over their idle computing resources to cloud providers” and strategic moves by China’s largest tech companies to favor DeepSeek models even over their in-house ones, suggests that this could change in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to reporting by Caijing Magazine, the chips in China most likely to be underutilized are Huawei’s Ascends, which have benefitted in terms of government pressure to buy domestic but remain underutilized because of a lack of useful AI models that are Ascend-compatible. This could change if DeepSeek adapts its models to run on Ascends, which it is reportedly working toward for model inference, though not model training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;20-between-the-chip-dies-acquired-from-tsmc-the-stockpiled-hbm-and-smics-increasing-ascend-production-huawei-and-deepseek-have-a-credible-path-to-a-million-ascend-chip-ai-supercluster-should-they-seek-to-build-one-though-they-will-face-challenges-in-large-scale-chip-integration-and-software-frameworks&quot;&gt;20. Between the chip dies acquired from TSMC, the stockpiled HBM, and SMIC’s increasing Ascend production, Huawei and DeepSeek have a credible path to a million-Ascend-chip AI supercluster should they seek to build one, though they will face challenges in large scale chip integration and software frameworks.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, sources told CSIS that TSMC has supplied Huawei with enough chip dies to manufacture a million Ascend 910C chips, each of which has roughly 60 percent the performance of an Nvidia H100 when used for inference. With the help of Huawei and the Chinese government, DeepSeek could plausibly succeed in driving a reallocation of the Nvidia H800s and H100s already in China toward itself for construction of a new AI model training data center. This could then be augmented by an additional, much larger cluster of Huawei Ascend 910Cs (or Nvidia H20s) to be used for AI model inference. Such a combination is a plausible, perhaps even likely, path for China to continue making significant progress in its AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, a million-chip cluster of Huawei Ascends would face the challenge of a shortage of AI models, software, and developer tools that are compatible with Huawei’s CANN software ecosystem. A second challenge is in integrating all of the chips as part of a single cluster where the whole is more than the sum of the parts. Financial Times reporter Eleanor Olcott interviewed one Beijing-based chip investor who said “The bottleneck at the moment isn’t getting the chips but figuring out how to make them work in a cluster. This is really complicated work.” Evidently the true attractiveness of the Huawei Ascend 910C chips is worse than the “60 percent of H100” figure might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;21-us-firms-are-still-ahead-of-china-in-the-race-toward-human-level-artificial-general-intelligence-and-beyond-human-level-artificial-superintelligence-however-the-gap-has-narrowed-significantly-and-it-is-unrealistic-to-expect-a-lead-of-more-than-a-year-or-two-even-with-extremely-aggressive-export-controls&quot;&gt;21. U.S. firms are still ahead of China in the race toward human-level artificial general intelligence and beyond human-level artificial superintelligence. However, the gap has narrowed significantly, and it is unrealistic to expect a lead of more than a year or two, even with extremely aggressive export controls.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, in the absence of export controls, it is plausible that Chinese firms would have already surpassed their U.S. competitors in developing and deploying frontier AI models. It is likewise plausible that China might have already succeeded in driving widespread adoption of the Huawei Ascend chips, just as Huawei’s smartphone division, bolstered by internal chip designs, was looking poised to overtake Apple’s iPhone in China prior to the introduction of effective export controls in 2020. The export controls have done much to slow and complicate China’s technological rise and march toward their longstanding objective of technological self-sufficiency. They are still having a significant effect even now and are poised to have even greater impact in the future as U.S. firms benefit from Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips and as China likely remains stuck at the 7 nm technology node until and unless they develop a domestic EUV lithography capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China’s successes in substantial government investment, chip smuggling, exploiting gaps in U.S. export control coverage, completing in-country transfers of equipment, hiring talent with experience from leading international firms, reverse-engineering foreign technology, harnessing state-backed economic espionage, and producing genuine domestic innovation are a formidable combination. U.S. firms, working at maximum effort and with the benefit of all their own advantages, will still likely be the first to develop artificial general intelligence or artificial superintelligence. This should not, however, be taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a meeting on February 17 between CCP Chairman Xi Jinping and Chinese technology executives, including DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei told Xi that his previous concerns about the lack of domestic advanced semiconductor production and the damaging impacts of U.S. export controls had eased because of recent breakthroughs by Huawei and its partners. It is possible that he is referring to the aforementioned domestic equipment transfer to SMIC’s facility. Ren further said that he is leading a network of more than 2,000 Chinese companies that are collectively working to ensure that China achieves self-sufficiency of more than 70 percent across the entire semiconductor value chain by 2028. These predictions should be taken seriously and have enormous strategic implications beyond just the AI sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for AI, the key question remains the one that Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, has succinctly posed: “whether China will also be able to get millions of chips.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s success to date suggests that, at least for Huawei Ascend chips, the answer is that they will have millions of chips within the next year or two. Thankfully, these chips are, at present, dramatically lower performing than Nvidia ones for training advanced AI models; they are also supported by a much weaker software ecosystem with many complex issues that will likely take years to sort out. This is the time that the export controls have bought for the United States to win the race to AGI and then use that victory to try and build more durable strategic advantages. At this point, all the margin for sloppy implementation of export controls or tolerance of large-scale chip smuggling has already been consumed. There is no more time to waste.&lt;/p&gt;

Tackling the politics and power dynamics that have exacerbated scarcity is the only way to tackle this existential issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;foreword&quot;&gt;Foreword&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;ciarán-ó-cuinn&quot;&gt;Ciarán Ó Cuinn&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In over a decade working as the director of the Middle East Desalination Research Center (MEDRC), a water diplomacy organization born out of the Middle East Peace Process, I have found that the solutions to water insecurity lie not just in technology, but in politics. I must have chaired more than 50 multilateral meetings on transboundary water in which external international experts advised that new data-sharing mechanisms or pieces of technology would overcome solely political problems. Countless engineers have proposed a new nexus for approaching Gaza’s water challenges. European scientists have encouraged new kinds of groundwater modeling to conclude the final status issue of water between Israel and Palestine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But effective policies and projects in this field are not just about dams and pipelines. They are also about culture and power. We at MEDRC have learned this lesson painfully throughout the years. Established as part of the Middle East Peace Process in 1996, MEDRC is an international organization that brings together 11 member states—including the core parties to the conflict, Israel and Palestine—as joint owners, guarantors, and co-equal partners in a broader effort defined only by a formal mandate “to assist the Middle East Peace Process.” Through its work on transboundary environmental issues like water and climate change, MEDRC provides a unique framework for negotiations, based on absolute equality between partners. But in delivering on our mandate to be a model organization for states seeking to use transboundary environmental issues in the service of a peace process, we have learned that a political economy analysis is a far more useful tool than any engineer’s diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, ignoring politics can derail otherwise-worthy water management projects. It can blind us to the downsides of projects that, though sensible from a narrow engineering standpoint, have the potential to embed dependency, neocolonialism, or unfair power relations. In conflict zones, advancing a water-for-peace agenda without a clear political framework can do tremendous harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why this new volume, edited by Natasha Hall, is such a welcome and important contribution for governments and actors managing water resources and conflicts more broadly. Although the focus is on water, the lessons here can inform mediators, government officials, and aid agencies on policy responses to wide-ranging transboundary issues, from climate change and the water-energy-food nexus to international relations and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a series of case studies from across the Middle East, the authors featured in this volume underline the importance of addressing politics in tackling water management issues. All of the chapters highlight the need for more holistic, diverse, and multidisciplinary approaches to water and environmental management. Though the focus is on the Middle East and the case studies are localized, the themes are globally relevant and the issues raised can be found across all continents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there are no generalities, Western bias, or orientalism here. The case studies are comprehensive, detailed, and locally informed. A refreshing heterogeneity runs through the report, recognizing and reflecting the social, cultural, and economic diversity of the Middle East today. Though most countries in the region are considered water stressed or water scarce, the political economy of water is varied even within these countries. Water systems in parts of the Gulf, for instance, with plentiful energy resources to power reverse-osmosis seawater desalination, are very different from systems in parts of the Levant that primarily rely on scarce ground and surface waters and outdated water-sharing agreements with neighbors. The case studies underline how, in such a diverse and politically complex region, the failure to fully consider power structures and dynamics can cause projects to take significantly longer to be realized, or even fail entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centrality of good public administration also cuts across all chapters. The quality of interdepartmental coordination and diplomacy can be the difference between a bureaucratic veneer and an effective developmental action. For example, the importance of interagency cooperation is key, but siloed approaches are commonplace. Water mandates in the region tend to exist across multiple governmental ministries, including those covering water, environment, energy, and agriculture. But while these departments may work on the same projects, they tend to have very little engagement together, and the frameworks for them to do so are lacking. Encouraging donor and domestic investment in good public management is among the most catalytic steps a state can take to deliver effective environmental management policies and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case studies below also highlight a gap between what would logically or technically work and what works on the ground. This rational-reality gap has been a key theme from MEDRC’s work. For example, external donors and partners tend to drive agendas and policies that may seem like a good idea from a Western donor’s headquarters but may not reflect the reality on the ground. Jordan’s Red Sea–Dead Sea Conveyance pipeline, analyzed in Chapter 4, is an excellent example that will be studied for decades. This high-profile and well-funded project, while providing tangible benefits, would have created politically untenable dependency between Jordan and Israel and also side-stepped Palestinians’ need for water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, at a transboundary level, the report highlights the urgent need for new multilateral mechanisms to address water management and wider environmental issues. Many transboundary efforts today are constrained by narrow and dated treaties. The highly politicized nature of water in the Middle East means that cooperation is often confined to narrow bilateral agreements that limit the potential to evolve and expand cooperation in the future. Overcoming that zero-sum game may also require a more comprehensive model that incorporates issues beyond water where cooperation is needed in order to level the playing field for downstream actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, ignoring politics is political. Doing so prevents a full analysis of the root causes and effects of water insecurity and hampers change. MEDRC’s work with the parties to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over the years has shown that the water crisis in Gaza, even before the current war, was a wholly political construct that cannot be understood or addressed outside that lens. In Jordan and Israel, the Red Sea–Dead Sea Conveyance pipeline failed because it did not address the real political fears, and the realities of the cold peace, between the two countries. In the Syrian civil war, the hand of politics has often been downplayed as a cause, in favor of broader explanations like climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edited volume makes it very clear: water and environmental policies, projects, and processes impose a broad spectrum of socioeconomic, cultural, and political impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our analyses and actions, we must appreciate and factor in this complexity in order to implement politically feasible solutions. Ignoring how the water policies of donors, mediators, and governments embed existing unequal power structures or create new ones can potentially cause harm to citizens, the environment, and international peace and security. The lessons of this volume can help us adhere to the to the first rule of peacebuilding and development: do no harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;natasha-hall&quot;&gt;Natasha Hall&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of water scarcity and conflict in the Middle East is an old one. Since 2500 BCE, the vast majority of documented violent incidents related to water have been in the Middle East and North Africa—442 by the count of the Pacific Institute. From ancient aqueducts to modern water systems, technology has allowed communities to develop water resources despite aridity and intervals of drought. But for all of technology’s miracles, governance and politics play a crucial role. Today, the region has access to more advanced technology for discovering and exploiting water resources than ever before. Yet communities continue to face extreme water insecurity. Violence over water is increasing, and conflict is impeding the ability to reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapidly growing populations, along with failures to effectively manage water and waste, have brought many countries to a precipice. According to the Iraqi government, the average flow of the once-mighty Tigris and Euphrates Rivers has declined 70 percent over the past century. The great man-made lakes of central Iraq, al Habbaniyah and al Razzaza, have all but disappeared. The Khabur River in Syria has been reduced to a mere dribble of sewage. And the legendary Jordan River is little more than a trickle by the time it reaches its eponymous country. The water level of the Dead Sea, where the Jordan River discharges, has dropped the equivalent of a seven-story building since the year 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Satellite Images of Surface Water of Lake Habbaniyah, Iraq, August 2020 vs. August 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is just above ground. The reduction in groundwater has been at least as dramatic. As surface water declines due to man-made diversions and climate change, countries increasingly look to the water underneath them for relief. One study, prepared jointly by NASA and the University of California Irvine, showed a decrease of 144 cubic kilometers—nearly the volume of Lake Tahoe—in the volume of the region’s fresh water between 2003 and 2009 alone. It was one of the largest liquid freshwater losses on Earth during this six-year period. Most of those fresh water declines in the region have been due to groundwater reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Changes in Groundwater Storage in the Middle East and North Africa, 2002 vs. 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change and population growth threaten to exacerbate these trends. The same study showed that 20 percent of freshwater losses were due to a decrease in snowmelt and soil moisture—both of which will continue to decline with climate change. While population growth appears to be leveling off in some places, the countries most vulnerable to climate change—like Iraq and Yemen—will continue to see sky-high increases. Both populations are expected to nearly double by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Population Growth in Selected Countries, 1961–2050&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States in the Middle East also struggle with cooperative and sustainable transboundary water management. Although 60 percent of surface waters are transboundary, and all countries share at least one aquifer, effective water-sharing agreements are few and far between. Rather than a driver of sustainable and equitable cooperation, water has been a source of major tension in the region. In the 1980s, Egyptian foreign minister Boutros Boutros-Ghali famously warned that the next war would be fought over the waters of the Nile. In the 1990s, peace agreements like the Oslo Accords pledged to deal with shared water resources, but many major promises were never implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major interstate wars did not come to pass, but in the following years governments became increasingly possessive of scarcer resources, with water becoming entangled in interstate hostilities and frictions. Responding to criticism regarding Turkey’s plans to build massive dams along the Euphrates, President Süleyman Demirel said in 1992 that “neither Syria or Iraq can lay claim to Turkey’s rivers any more than Ankara could claim their oil. This is a matter of sovereignty. We have a right to do anything we like. . . . They cannot say they share our water resources.” In turn, the Syrian government did not go to war over water, but for decades it did provide support and sanctuary to the Kurdish Workers’ Party (PKK) to conduct raids on Turkey in retaliation for the dam-building undertaken as part of Ankara’s Southeastern Anatolian Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States in the Middle East also struggle with cooperative and sustainable transboundary water management. Although 60 percent of surface waters are transboundary, and all countries share at least one aquifer, effective water-sharing agreements are few and far between.9 Rather than a driver of sustainable and equitable cooperation, water has been a source of major tension in the region. In the 1980s, Egyptian foreign minister Boutros Boutros-Ghali famously warned that the next war would be fought over the waters of the Nile.10 In the 1990s, peace agreements like the Oslo Accords pledged to deal with shared water resources, but many major promises were never implemented.

Increasing water insecurity, and the reality that transboundary cooperation may not be forthcoming, has forced states to look inward at their water usage. Though most countries in the region are water insecure, water management policies have historically fostered a sense of abundance. Reversing course on decades of unsustainable water management practices has proven to be a monumental task, as those practices are intertwined with increasingly complex and dangerous political environments. For decades, governments across the region have heavily subsidized—if not freely provided—food, energy, and water in return for loyalty. In the minds of many government officials, curbing water usage by increasing costs or enforcing restrictions would be a threat to political stability. As a result, governments continued to delay the inevitable, failing to fully enact reforms and instead seeking to find new sources of water. Now, those sources, in turn, are running dry or becoming contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, two events violently shook the region: the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the Arab Spring of 2011. Water reforms were put on hold for the foreseeable future. The ensuing conflicts, forced displacement, and wartime corruption continue to plague the region. Even where violent conflict has overturned established power structures in the past two decades, the historical hallmarks of governance in the region—patronage and predation—have reemerged in the wake of the Arab Spring and are now wreaking havoc on water security. In good times, governments or local authorities rely on patronage, including cheap or free basic services like water for loyalty and stability. In bad times, authorities become more predatory, as scarcity forces powerful stakeholders to restrict these widespread benefits in order to maintain their own lifestyles. As times get harder, the number of beneficiaries of patronage decreases and benefits that were previously enjoyed diminish. Water goes from being free or cheap to nonexistent or exorbitantly expensive. Authorities resort to harsher, more oppressive measures to maintain power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years of avoiding tough decisions on water usage—both at the national and transboundary levels—have now come to a head in the Middle East. Understanding how to overcome this challenge requires a more robust analysis not only of how this situation came to be, but of the stakeholders and vested interests that developed over time and the negotiations necessary to move forward. Injecting these considerations into this analysis of water reforms is not meant to further securitize the issue or encourage political instability. On the contrary, dealing with the politics of water could allow countries to prevent the full-blown crises that are occurring today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing the interests of various stakeholders allows governments, civil society organizations, and aid agencies to triage politically feasible steps to water security. This requires an in-depth analysis of each country case. Though many countries have similar histories of water usage—and though the technical and economic solutions for water insecurity are fairly clear—the political, cultural, and economic landscapes of these countries are dramatically different today. Protracted and internationalized conflicts throughout the region have further complicated matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving water security is significantly more challenging in areas already affected by war, where people tend to be more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. For this reason, all of the case studies in this volume are conflict-affected, but the recommendations for each are starkly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries that are heavily dependent on humanitarian aid, like Yemen and Syria, are unable to address the full scope of the problem due to legal, financial, and political issues. As a result, the humanitarian community—a sector that is growing alongside the protracted crises in the region—has been forced to expand its mandate in order to provide basic services for longer periods. Emergency aid, however, cannot address the political drivers of water insecurity. As such, long-term dependence on aid can have deleterious effects on water resources. Unable to overcome transboundary issues, war economies, and power imbalances, aid agencies resort to water trucking, drilling for groundwater, and handing out solar pumps. In the meantime, wastewater or sewage is often ejected into waterways without treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-state actors with uncertain political futures and difficult relationships with the international community control northeastern Syria and the Yemeni highlands, the first two case studies covered in this volume. Efforts to work around these non-state armed groups to enhance water security have been inadequate. In these cases, the international community tends to wait for a peace agreement or shift in control. But it is unclear when either conflict will resolve, or if any peace agreement would improve water policies. Authors Dr. Mohammad Al-Saidi and Lyse Mauvais make recommendations for what can be done in the near term and how water could be built into longer-term negotiations for peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case study of Iraq, a country that has been affected by years of war and sanctions, is a tragic example of how, in the context of an imperfect peace, money does not buy water security. Accustomed to centuries of water abundance, many Iraqi farmers continue to practice traditional flood agriculture. Water is still nearly free, but times have changed, especially in the downstream Basra governorate. As upstream communities divert water and build dams, the flow of the mighty Tigris and Euphrates decreases, leaving southern Iraq with increasingly saline soil and cracked mud flats, rather than the abundant waters of the past. Meanwhile, remnants of conflict, in the form of endemic corruption and infrastructural neglect, have severely inhibited the country’s ability to withstand both climate change and reduced river flows from upstream neighbors. The challenges of systemic change in Iraq are so daunting that fellow authors, Dr. Hassan al Janabi and Maha Yassin, argue that the Basra governorate should prioritize rehabilitating drinking water networks and accommodating newly urbanized communities to improve health outcomes and avoid increasing societal tensions. While providing recommendations for agricultural water use and transboundary negotiations, the authors note that the political obstacles are significant, but that other steps can be taken now to address immediate and long-term needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan, one of the most arid countries in the world, has a stable government but still struggles with constant external shocks to its water supplies, as refugees from neighboring countries have arrived in the hundreds of thousands for nearly a century. Unreliable transboundary neighbors have also strained Jordan’s resources and ability to manage dwindling water resources. Dr. Neda Zawahri makes the case for how the Jordanian government, in cooperation with civil society, can begin to implement reforms that have long been delayed. She also argues that given the country’s precarious position, Jordan and its benefactors need to build up the country’s own independent sources of water to make it more resilient to contentious regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renowned scholars, engineers, and aid organizations have written innumerable reports on water insecurity in the Middle East. Many of them note the environmental and human consequences of the failure to adapt to scarcity, rehashing standard technical and policy solutions to water insecurity. But projects based solely on technical solutions have either failed altogether or even worsened sustainability and equity when confronted with political realities. Other experts and government officials have lamented those political realities and delayed taking measures to chip away at the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This volume takes a different approach. The authors convincingly argue that waiting for a ripe moment to address water insecurity in the Middle East would simply allow the issue to become an existential threat—for many, it already is. Yet they do not shy away from the political challenges involved. Rather, those obstacles are woven into the potential solutions they offer. Their recommendations are not silver bullets, but they are politically feasible when pursued through the appropriate steps. Rather than circumvent conflict and power imbalances, stakeholders can take the steps recommended here to improve water security and equity. They can acknowledge those challenges and provide effective incentives to relevant parties to change behavior, linking water to other important issues such as trade and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of the incentives, limitations, and influence of political and economic stakeholders in water security—from water companies and powerful farmers to donor states and local communities—will allow governments, civil society groups, and aid agencies to craft realistic policies to address this increasingly existential challenge. The pages that follow suggest what those policies could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-1&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, poor neighborhoods in the Syrian city of Qamishli revived an old ritual commonly practiced in rural villages across northeastern Syria. They paraded “rain brides” made of scrap fabric through the streets, begging for rain to come and for a good harvest that would keep the price of bread, meat, and dairy within reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The northeastern Syrian countryside usually provides 60 percent of Syria’s wheat, but from the summer of 2021 to February 2023 it remained largely lifeless, stricken by drought. In many areas there was not a single shrub or tuft of wild grass in the fields. Vast expanses of parched baal (the local term for non-irrigated agricultural land) stretched to the horizon, broken here and there only by patches of irrigated wheat, islands of life in the desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summers of 2021 and 2022, the national wheat harvest plummeted to a quarter of the prewar average due to drought, limiting the availability of bread. Skyrocketing inflation has left meat and dairy increasingly out of reach for most families, who now rely on subsidized, state-baked bread as their lifeline. Farmers in northeastern Syria grew angry and increasingly desperate, while millions of other Syrians went hungry. As of April 2024, the World Food Programme (WFP) estimated that 12.9 million people in Syria were still food insecure, including 3.1 million who were severely food insecure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the countryside, many fields remained fallow as Arab and Kurdish farmers grumbled about the high cost of fertilizers, pesticides, and the fuel needed to operate the water pumps that irrigated their land. Farmers went into debt to cope with these rising costs, hoping to increase dwindling yields. To their dismay, water levels also dropped in riverbeds, dams, and irrigation wells due to the lack of rain. In some areas, the water table dropped so low that watering crops cost more than letting them die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pastoralists have been even worse off. Barley—a primarily rain-fed fodder crop—also failed in 2021 and 2022, and there was little straw left from other cereal harvests as an alternative. Market-sold barley became scarce, with prices soaring by over 40 percent in the summer of 2022. Even the wild plants that normally provide some pasture in winter withered away. Many herders were forced to sell their sheep at a discount, rather than letting them die of hunger. In northern Hasakah province, for instance, an extended family of 20 members, displaced from the Raqqa countryside in 2020, lost their entire herd of 500 sheep to hunger and disease over two years. To get by, they work in menial day jobs in nearby villages and farmed other peoples’ land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most worrisome manifestation of this crisis has been the despair of agricultural engineers, NGO staff, and local officials, who have been all equally at a loss for solutions. “If the weather becomes permanently like this, we will need to start looking for alternatives. Probably an alternative country,” sighed a senior agricultural official in the Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), the de-facto government that controls most of the country’s northeast. His half-hearted humor highlights the existential threat of water insecurity for the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dilemma for aid workers and local officials in northeastern Syria is that there is no apolitical roadmap for achieving water security. Syria’s water crisis was and remains inextricably linked to the 13-year-long war that followed the 2011 revolution, and to geopolitical tensions with neighboring Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to secure access to water and electricity, Ankara has built dozens of dams along the Euphrates River and its three main tributaries that flow into Syria, limiting the flow of water downstream. To make matters worse, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and its civil branch, the AANES, are connected to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Turkey considers a terrorist organization and national security threat. To weaken the SDF, Turkey has not only restricted access to water but also systematically targeted oil infrastructure in northeastern Syria, severely exacerbating water and soil pollution while limiting farmers’ access to fuel for irrigation. Turkish-backed opposition factions controlling other areas in northeastern Syria also regularly deprive the roughly one million residents of Hasakah, one of the region’s biggest cities, of tap water through their control of water-related infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of drought, climate change, and Turkey’s actions, the Euphrates River has dropped to historic lows since 2020, crippling the supply of irrigation water and electricity from hydroelectric dams. The river is Syria’s lifeline, historically providing 85 percent of its renewable water. But what remains of it today is so polluted by sewage and agricultural runoff that cholera, a previously eradicated waterborne disease, re-emerged in the country during the war. So far, widespread thirst and famine have been averted by aggressive use of the area’s remaining groundwater resources and by the trucking of water to the worst-hit areas—but these solutions are hardly sustainable in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the international community has lost interest in Syria’s intertwined water and humanitarian crises. In early 2024, humanitarian needs were only 37 percent funded, which led the UN World Food Programme in January 2024 to limit food assistance to cover just 5.6 million Syrians—a quarter of the prewar population covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there have been unprecedented changes since then. The Assad dynasty, which ruled Syria with an iron fist for over five decades, fell unlocking unprecedented hopes for peace and political change—but also deep anxieties about the future of the country. Future humanitarian trends are difficult to predict in this tumultuous context, but a steady stream of funding for the water sector is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northeastern Syria enjoys credible prospects of political stability and economic recovery, which could have positive effects on the rest of the country. But the future of this de-facto government, the AANES, is uncertain, seeing as Turkish-backed opposition factions hostile to the SDF control ever-greater swathes of northern Syria. Along with diminishing Western interest in the Middle East, this political instability threatens to allow the water crisis to spiral out of control—along with both Syria’s food security and regional security. The failure to manage this crisis highlights the central challenge in dealing with food and water security in Syria: how to foster water governance during a protracted conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain how northeastern Syria got to this point, this chapter begins by providing background on Syria’s water usage and policies prior to the 2011 revolution and charting how the ongoing water crisis has intersected with the current conflict. The chapter’s second section explains how the current political landscape shapes local and international responses to the water crisis. It argues that although humanitarian assistance and remittances are keeping some Syrians afloat, the lack of coordination between the AANES, donor governments, and aid organizations hinders the implementation of comprehensive solutions to the region’s multifaceted water issues. Worse, current aid interventions are contributing to unsustainable outcomes, including the depletion of Syria’s groundwater resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter concludes with a series of steps that those interested in the stability of Turkey, Syria, and Iraq could take to avert a major calamity—involving more political will, longer-term planning, and better coordination with local actors. As the breadbasket of the country, the future for millions of Syrians hangs precariously on the northeast’s ability to secure its water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;northeastern-syrias-complex-water-crisis&quot;&gt;Northeastern Syria’s Complex Water Crisis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A HISTORY OF MISMANAGEMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2020–2023 drought has tested the resilience of Syrian farmers in unprecedented ways, but their ability to cope was jeopardized from the start by a legacy of public mismanagement. Long before the 2011 revolution, Syria’s water resources were already being squandered, largely due to the Syrian government’s agricultural policies. Historically, the semi-arid ecosystems of northeastern Syria supported livelihoods centered on mobile pastoralism and rain-fed farming, not the large-scale intensive agriculture of today. This agricultural transition, which started under the French Mandate in the 1920s, sharply accelerated from the 1960s to the 1980s under the leadership of the Ba‘ath party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eyeing food sovereignty, the Syrian government supported modern agriculture on a large scale, centralized the distribution of seeds and inputs, and encouraged massive investments in infrastructure and irrigation via loans to farmers. Government subsidies allocated support to farmers based on the surface area of irrigated land they farmed, thereby encouraging them to switch from rain-fed agriculture to irrigation, even in areas with no access to surface water. As a result, the drilling of private wells grew exponentially. The initial goal of the subsidies was to enhance Syria’s food security through increased wheat production and to support the country’s cotton-based textile industry, but it perversely led farmers to abandon local drought-resistant seeds and become increasingly dependent on irrigation, a trend that has accelerated in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These policies allowed Syria to become a net exporter of wheat while simultaneously increasing the production of cash crops like tobacco and cotton. But they also made farmers reliant on modern varieties of wheat designed to thrive under irrigated conditions and with chemical inputs. As a result, irrigated agricultural surfaces expanded eightfold from 1990 to 2000, eventually reaching around 360,000 hectares in Hasakah province before the war. Agricultural irrigation is the top source of water usage in Syria today, representing around 85 percent of national consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/p9Go9RP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Increase in Irrigated Land, 1961–2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift to large-scale irrigation was neither profitable for the government—which heavily subsidized agriculture—nor sustainable. In the early 2000s, the springs feeding the Khabur River, a key tributary of the Euphrates, went partially dry due to overpumping in the transboundary aquifer between Syria and Turkey. Consequences were dire for Assyrian, Arab, and Kurdish farming communities in this crucial basin. Then, between 2006 and 2009, a drought hit, exposing the vulnerabilities created by the government’s water and agricultural policies. Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to leave northeastern Syria, and most received little to no assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, conflict, droughts, and displacement have exacerbated the crisis. Groundwater wells became essential survival tools as the Khabur dried and the flow of the Euphrates decreased. Many AANES officials see the Khabur as a cautionary tale, fearing that other river basins will suffer a similar fate as groundwater pumping intensifies across the region, both for agriculture and drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE WATER CRISIS COLLIDES WITH THE CONFLICT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria’s water crisis captured media attention in late 2020, when low and erratic rainfall, along with higher-than-average temperatures, began to devastate agricultural production in northeastern Syria. By 2021, rainfall plummeted to 50–70 percent below Syria’s historical average. The following winter rainfall decreased to 75–92 percent below average in the northeast. This had a devastating and immediate impact on wheat production, 50 percent of which is rain-fed across Syria—a proportion that rises to 70 percent in the northeast, and up to 85 percent in Hasakah province. In 2021 and 2022, wheat yields reached historic lows of around 1 million tons—just a quarter of the prewar average. These numbers were also well below the amount of wheat—3.2 million tons—needed to feed the 15 million Syrians living in government-held areas, let alone the 2.6 million living in AANES regions and the 4.4 million in opposition-held territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the rains returned in 2023, a healthy season is likely to become the exception rather than the rule. Recent studies predict that droughts are 25 times more likely to occur in Syria today due to global temperature increases linked to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, irrigation and drinking water are under threat for other reasons. Turkey’s upstream damming has caused drastic reductions in the flow of the Euphrates River and its tributaries, which have long been a lifeline for agricultural communities in northeastern Syria. Based on transboundary water-sharing agreements, Ankara must release 500 cubic meters of water per second to Syria, yet that volume has dropped to under 200 cubic meters according to Syrian dam authorities. Although over five million people in Syria directly depend on the Euphrates for drinking water (alongside millions more in downstream Iraq), Turkey shows no sign of loosening its stranglehold on the river. Adding to these challenges, Turkish-backed factions have, over the past four years, repeatedly interrupted the operations of Alouk water station, which supplies drinking water to around a million people in Hasakah province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WATER GOVERNANCE IN NORTHEASTERN SYRIA TODAY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 12 years of war, Syria gradually split into three main zones: Syrian government-controlled territory in the south and central areas of the country, opposition-controlled areas in the northwest, and AANES-controlled areas in the northeast. This territorial division persisted for several years until the beginning of December 2024, when a rebel offensive that initiated in the northwestern province of Idlib toppled the Syrian government over the course of a few days. Among the galaxy of opposition groups that remained active in Syria throughout the war are also several Turkish-backed opposition groups, who were contained during most of the war along the northern border with Turkey. In December 2024, these groups markedly expanded east into AANES-controlled territory, prompting new waves of displacement toward AANES-controlled northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the war, the internationally recognized government headquartered in Damascus and the main governing authority in northwestern Idlib province were subject to sanctions by the United States and its Western partners; while the AANES, which is the local partner in the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State, enjoyed steadier access to stabilization and early recovery funding. As of December 2024, the leading rebel faction now in control of Damascus remains sanctioned internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, sandwiched between Turkey and the Syrian army for around a decade, the AANES has historically been heavily dependent on the military presence of the United States to ensure its survival. It is also not an internationally recognized government, a fact that limits its capacity to engage with foreign partners. It does not have the ability to openly sell oil internationally. Most aid funding is channeled through NGOs rather than to the AANES directly. Many donors also have strict red lines that prevent their partners from transferring funds or equipment to the AANES or working face-to-face with its departments, fearing this would aggravate Ankara and constitute a violation of Damascus’s sovereignty. However, those red lines are also not entirely coherent, which has confused and frustrated NGOs, local authorities, and beneficiaries. Some donor governments, for example, ask their partners to work only with nominally independent agricultural cooperatives rather than AANES agricultural departments. Others are amenable to some degree of collaboration and capacity building with AANES, as long as material transfers are avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These policies are partially a result of ongoing uncertainty about the political future of the area. As U.S. leaders renew promises to disengage from Syria over the long term, donor governments and Turkey have no reason to invest politically in the current status quo. But as they wait to see how governance will evolve in the coming years, the situation grows more precarious. In the meantime, a constellation of stabilization and humanitarian actors, local authorities, and international donors operates in a splintered policy landscape that is not conducive to improving water security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE AANES: WALKING A TIGHTROPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main water management stakeholder in northeastern Syria before the fall of the Assad regime was the AANES: the most recent iteration of a governing coalition of Kurdish, Assyrian, and Arab parties established during the campaign to defeat the Islamic State in northeastern and eastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its non-state status, AANES agricultural institutions essentially mimic the highly centralized bureaucracies of the former Syrian regime. Agricultural and irrigation departments closely oversee the distribution of water from canals and issue yearly “agricultural plans” to farmers. These contain detailed breakdowns of wheat and other crops that each farmer is requested to plant. Based on this, agricultural departments then allocate subsidized seeds, fertilizers, and fuel to each farmer. Rationing the fuel used to operate private wells, water pumps, and tractors allows the AANES to control both agricultural production and water usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But donor governments and NGOs see this deeply ingrained centralization of agriculture as an obstacle to promoting new, more sustainable practices among farmers. The AANES wields tremendous influence over not only farmers’ habits, but also their appetite for change. “Farmers are used to this system where they receive what they need and sell what they produce [to the state],” one donor said. This hinders efforts to promote alternative crops or irrigation methods. Many farmers prefer sticking to crops that the AANES subsidizes and promotes because doing so gives them guaranteed access to cheaper inputs and a sale price set each year by the AANES. Experimenting with new crops means taking on financial risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AANES has been understandably wary of changing the model. Because farmers have been socialized to expect a high degree of support from the state (now, the AANES), their resentment is quick to grow against perceived shortcomings of political elites. “Agriculture is a losing business,” said a Kurdish investor cultivating several rain-fed and irrigated cereal fields in Hasakah. “Farmers can only benefit with state support.” Even in Kurdish areas of rural Hasakah, which suffered the most under the Assad regime, farmers occasionally express nostalgia for its agricultural institutions, which are often idealized (now that they are gone) as better at defending their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the political tightrope that the AANES walks with the local population and regional opponents, the administration is unlikely to change its agricultural policies without backing from international benefactors like the United States—backing that is more uncertain than ever before. Thus, the AANES lacks the political will to regulate farmers’ water use, even though most aid actors see this as a priority. Agricultural wells are not metered, and AANES officials do not enforce existing regulations out of fear of political pushback in rural areas. “For now, we tell farmers to use the pumps for 12 hours per day maximum, and we give them just enough subsidized fuel to do that. But we cannot enforce it. It’s only an instruction,” one official from Hasakah’s agriculture department admitted. In the fall of 2022, the AANES issued a ban on drilling new irrigation boreholes in order to protect groundwater at the height of the drought. But it could not actually enforce this rule, and wells continued to be drilled in the open. In such a weak regulatory landscape, the impact of aid is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AANES also lacks the technical capacity to repair water infrastructure and monitor water quality and quantity. Of the roughly 80 wells that are used exclusively to monitor groundwater levels and quality in AANES-controlled areas, all but six were out of order in 2023, according to Hasakah’s water department. Those six were rehabilitated only in 2022 by an international NGO planning to carry out northeastern Syria’s first hydrological baseline assessment since the early 2000s. But even this assessment may be of little immediate use to AANES staff, most of whom are not trained to use the devices and lack the transportation and fuel needed to visit the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A CHAOTIC AID POLICY LANDSCAPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2020, a plethora of foreign aid actors have been paying increasing attention to early recovery and development needs by funding water-wise irrigation techniques, fodder production, seed distribution, and the solarization of wells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while beneficiaries welcome the projects, these interventions have done little to transform the systemic causes of water insecurity. “There is low awareness overall in the aid sector on what is needed to respond to this crisis,” said one official working at an organization that helps NGOs coordinate their efforts. “Many NGOs prefer to support farmers with immediate solutions rather than wait and invest in long-term solutions. And anyway, there are very few long-term options open to us due to the very nature of humanitarian funding cycles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NGO projects are uncoordinated because “people don’t talk to each other,” as one donor put it. “Even if there are coordination mechanisms in place, NGOs often have restrictions from their donors, and there is competition between actors in the field—so information is withheld for various reasons.” To make matters worse, there is no coordinated strategy to monitor the water used across humanitarian interventions, which means NGOs and donors are running simultaneous projects to drill or repair boreholes without a clear picture of the state of groundwater resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aid sector has, to its credit, tried to maintain aging and damaged infrastructure. NGOs run many projects to rehabilitate irrigation infrastructure and water canals—particularly in Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor—that were destroyed in the war against the Islamic State. Yet many of these networks are becoming less useful to farmers as the flow of water in nearby rivers decreases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some NGOs now focus on retrofitting water pump stations, adapting them to lower water levels in riverbeds. They also encourage individuals and communities to save water through modern irrigation methods, as opposed to the ancestral practice of flooding fields periodically. But while these interventions can help certain communities cope with reduced access to water, they have a limited impact. Donors recognize that Syria’s prewar irrigation networks are too large and interconnected to be rehabilitated by NGOs alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there are other overlooked dimensions of the water crisis that require longer-term interventions and coordination with the AANES. Little has been done, for example, to address rampant water pollution through improved waste management or wastewater treatment, or to build the AANES’s capacity to regulate imports of pesticides and fertilizer. Yet the pollution of surface and groundwater resources is a major threat hovering over Syria, as contaminated aquifers may become unsuitable for drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE LIMITS OF THE CURRENT RESPONSE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As both climate change and Turkish politics are out of the hands of the AANES, aid actors, and the government in Damascus, their responses to the water crisis have focused on immediate solutions to increase the availability of drinking water and irrigation in the short run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this supply-driven strategy is now reaching its limits. Wells drilled haphazardly in recent years to supply communities with drinking water were often dug improperly, created too close together and with no technical oversight from local authorities. In Hasakah city, residents have even started drilling wells in their gardens and backyards to make up for municipal water shortages. “When they saw that the drought was continuing for a third year in 2023, more people started drilling,” said one cereal farmer in the countryside of Hasakah. “We’ve had several droughts in the past,” he added, “but we always managed to cope by irrigating and using extra fertilizers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet groundwater abstraction is not a magic solution to the current crisis. In many places, the intensification of well-drilling threatens groundwater resources. When boreholes are drilled too closely together, their proximity creates imbalances in water-table pressure, disrupting the distribution of water in the aquifer. In some cases, the boreholes stop producing water. This is due not to a natural drop in the water table but to interferences from nearby boreholes that prevent the water from rising up as it normally should. Haphazard well-drilling also increases the risk of groundwater pollution: every new borehole is another avenue through which aquifers can be contaminated. Practitioners and experts acknowledge that these practices must be urgently regulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite growing concerns about groundwater abstraction, the AANES has quelled farmers’ discontent by maintaining historical fuel subsidies that enable them to pump water from licensed wells. In parallel, many NGOs are now providing solar panels to assist the pumping of water from community-owned wells. These solarization projects, meant to help communities and farmers access water at a lower cost and with less pollution, raise concerns among some AANES officials that expanding access to solar energy will drive over-pumping, since subsidized fuel is currently the AANES’s only means of controlling how much water farmers can pump. Within the aid sector, many experienced local staff share these doubts. And although the private sector supplies many of these solar panels, NGOs’ solarization projects still have an impact on both water use and the long-term management of discarded panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another downside of current humanitarian projects is that they still focus primarily on farmers using irrigation—via support for seeds, farming techniques, alternative crops, fuel distributions, and irrigation—but they have little to offer livestock herders or farmers using rain-fed agriculture, who are most vulnerable to drought. “Our preferred beneficiaries are irrigated farmers, and the ones who need our interventions the most are non-irrigated ones,” a senior staff member at an NGO coordination platform summarized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many NGOs have understandable difficulties designing projects suited for rain-fed farmers. Such projects could include insurance schemes in case of harvest failures, which would ensure these farmers continue to plant rainfed crops, an essential source of animal feed. To help pastoralists, the aid sector could improve and expand distributions of veterinary medicine and feed, which often come too little, too late, according to these communities. Aid donors could also pursue longer-term projects to replant wild shrubs, restore wild rangelands—vast swathes of which are overgrazed—and rehabilitate boreholes in rangelands that once served nomadic herders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, aid actors and AANES officials are aware that many of their interventions have been inadequate at best, and unsustainable at worst. But with a lack of a longer-term vision that confronts the structural causes of the water crisis, NGOs continue to implement these small-scale projects. “We can’t work directly with local authorities, and we cannot engage with the big actors like Turkey, the AANES, and the Assad regime to effectively ensure a bigger supply of water,” a Western government donor said. “So our focus is on . . . localized interventions that don’t need coordination with the AANES.” But most stakeholders, from farmers to aid actors, know that these are temporary solutions that will be unable to prevent a full-blown crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rethinking-approaches-to-water-in-northeastern-syria&quot;&gt;Rethinking Approaches to Water in Northeastern Syria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a new strategy, Syria’s water crisis seems doomed to spiral further out of control. Even if abundant rainfall in coming years alleviates some pressure on water resources, the current situation suggests a grim future for water in Syria. The good news is that there are options to reform the current approach to the water crisis—options that would provide adequate incentives for behavioral change among actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LESSONS OF THE PAST COULD HERALD A BRIGHTER FUTURE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the region’s de-facto government—equipped with institutions, good agricultural extension services, and a strong interest in bolstering the region’s economic and social stability—the AANES has been the actor most likely to have an impact on water use and users. However, any governing body will have to tackle the same challenges that the AANES faced. The AANES experience provides valuable lessons. The fall of Assad and the subsequent potential to open up the country to investment create new much-needed possibilities as well. However, if aid actors continue to follow a short-term aid approach, the next crisis could quickly spiral out of control for this fragile and food-insecure country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, the AANES has avoided directly regulating water use (through measures like metering systems and taxes) due to fear of popular backlash, much like other governments mentioned in this volume. But with stronger financial incentives, offered through agricultural loans and subsidies, a government could expand water-wise irrigation methods and shift away from the water-intensive monoculture that is detrimental to pastoral ecosystems and soil quality. In coordination, the international donor community could also support staff in efforts to monitor the quality and quantity of water resources, particularly groundwater. This support could be particularly targeted to heavily water-stressed areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AANES officials have shown great eagerness—to the point of desperation—for new solutions to the water crisis. Any future government is likely to do the same. Scaling up NGO interventions such as agricultural loans, which donors could partly fund, would be a welcome intervention. Donors and future investors will also need to support efforts to monitor groundwater levels and quality, as well as tackle water pollution from sources like pesticides and fertilizers, oil extraction and refining, and the unregulated dumping of solid waste. The AANES is still fighting wars on all fronts and uncertain of its political future. Its Board of Environment says these issues “are not priorities” in the current context. That is unlikely to change, as the Kurdish dominated government faces a more uncertain future than ever before. However, any government will need to stabilize the situation and ensure equity for all stakeholders in order to keep the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mix of financial and technical supports are the key entry points through which donors can influence Syrian water policies. Such assistance could start with capacity building and technical support for water and agricultural departments. These efforts could also be directed toward limiting the import and use of low-quality agricultural inputs, which have replaced the state-issued fertilizers produced in Homs before the war. “Chinese companies have flooded the market with products we don’t know, and there is no one to monitor their effects,” a cereal farmer in rural Hasakah said in 2023. Many other farmers and agricultural unions echoed these complaints. “Before, these things were provided by and certified by the state, and we didn’t have to worry about their quality.” Many farmers, agricultural union members, and AANES officials believe testing labs are needed to monitor the quality of imports now sold on the market. Such labs could allow aid actors and government officials to regulate, or at least raise awareness about, low-quality products that pose the most direct risks to health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the fall of Assad, there is also a chance for sanctions to be lifted or lightened, encouraging much-needed investment in the sector. Even more positively, there is a greater possibility of the Syrian economy once again becoming connected. With support to rehabilitate refineries and an agreement to equitably share oil revenues, Syria’s makeshift oil drilling and refining could also be a thing of the past, allowing the ground that farmers depend on to finally be cleared of toxic pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE ROLE OF DONORS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western donors have pumped hundreds of millions of dollars over the years into stabilization and early recovery projects in northern and eastern Syria. In 2023, under the umbrella of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) started mobilizing $42 million to support agriculture in non-regime-controlled areas of Syria, $28 million for livelihood projects, and $50 million for governance, infrastructure, economic recovery, and civil society projects. The United States and its partners spent billions more in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Syria’s Western donors have also been losing interest in the region, making future funding uncertain and long-term programming impossible. The short span of humanitarian and stabilization funding—two years at most—drives NGOs to pursue short-term interventions based on donors’ current whims and geographic priorities, rather than thought-out strategies. While they may satisfy donors’ priorities, these projects largely fail to address the root causes of the water crisis and may even make things worse by contributing to unmonitored pumping from Syria’s depleted groundwater reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donor governments have a big role to play in redesigning current aid and stabilization programs in ways that factor in the impacts of both climate change and Turkey’s damming. Large donors could work jointly to ensure that NGOs abide by strict principles to do no harm to water supplies. This may mean investing more resources in hydrological assessments and in the rehabilitation of monitoring wells. Large donors could also push for better coordination among the stakeholders they fund, to ensure that data on all existing water resources (especially groundwater) is shared among implementing partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing no harm also means improving waste management across all aid programming. After 13 years of war, virtually no attention has been paid to the management of solid waste from camps hosting internally displaced persons (IDPs), which is dumped in open-air informal landfills that are sometimes located close to potable water wells or drain into springs and river beds. At the very least, NGOs responsible for waste management should ensure that waste is disposed of in areas far from riverbeds and important groundwater reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PRIORITIZING DIPLOMACY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Turkey’s outsized role in Syria’s water woes, donor engagement on technical fixes must go hand-in-hand with attempts by Western states to engage Ankara on transboundary water sharing. Restoring—or at least increasing—some of the Euphrates’ flow is the most immediate and effective way to alleviate Syria’s water crisis and lift pressure on groundwater resources, which should remain the country’s best-guarded asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But exerting any influence over Turkey’s policy is difficult. Local NGOs have called for establishing “an impartial and independent monitoring mechanism for transboundary water resources shared by Syria, Türkiye, and Iraq to oversee the three States’ compliance with signed agreements,” supporting dialogue between the three countries. Such a mechanism is unlikely to exert any significant influence on Turkey, but its findings may at least serve as a basis for donor governments—fellow NATO members—to advocate for better water sharing with Ankara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long run, donors, potential investors, and local stakeholders will not be incentivized to invest in better management of Syria’s water resources if Turkey or any other warring party continues to systemically target the country’s energy and water infrastructure. Turkey has attacked this infrastructure multiple times over the years. In January 2024, Turkish airstrikes damaged northeastern Syria’s only gas plant and key energy hub, the Suwaydiyah plant, putting nearly 100 boreholes out of service and depriving over one million residents of electricity, gas, and fuel. These strikes often target oil fields, causing direct air, soil, and water pollution. By destabilizing electricity grids, Turkish attacks also drive short-term reliance on generators; by destroying oil infrastructure, they upend efforts to regulate pollution from the oil sector. Any effort to manage pollution—while entirely necessary to protect remaining water resources—will be a drop in the ocean if such infrastructure continues to be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For nearly a decade, donors have invested heavily—in blood and treasure—to recover this territory from the Islamic State and stabilize the area. Yet these efforts will be wasted if there is no political will to address the structural causes of Syria’s water crisis, which is highly consequential not just for Syria but also for the wider region. The fall of Assad has not made the country’s water insecurity, which preceded the conflict go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agriculture in northeastern Syria feeds millions around the country, but the area is now critically threatened by rising input costs and declining access to water. As this chapter has highlighted, failed harvests have already pushed farmers and herders to the brink, bringing cascading impacts to the food supply and prices of staple foods. To cope, many farmers rely on remittances from relatives abroad to stay afloat. Others are abandoning the land or leasing their fields to pastoralists. Those who can no longer afford to feed their herds or sow their fields have few options apart from moving to bigger cities to work as day laborers—or leaving the country, if they can. On a large scale, rural exodus and the loss of agricultural livelihoods directly impact Syria’s prospects for security. As remote rural areas empty, armed groups fill the void, offering paths out of misery for remaining local youth. This is true not just in Syria but also in neighboring Iraq. As water levels drop in the Euphrates, many of Syria’s agricultural woes are spreading to communities downstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northeastern Syria must be understood as central to the stability of Syria and Iraq. Despite its importance, Western donors have long been losing interest in the region and emphasize that they will not remain forever. This tenuousness creates a vicious cycle in which regional stakeholders are simply waiting out U.S. presence, and therefore, not investing in the future. This is a strategic mistake, especially for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northeastern Syria is one of the few places in the Middle East where U.S. policy still has a role to play that is clearly constructive. Rather than simply treating symptoms through security assistance and limited humanitarian aid, the United States could be preventing a larger crisis by devoting more attention to northeastern Syria. At a time when Washington’s responses to crises in Yemen, Iraq, and Gaza have been ineffective and seemingly limited to precision airstrikes and regional policing, northeastern Syria is a place where the United States and its allies can provide a stabilizing influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a security perspective, the United States and its allies have little to gain by letting the region slip back into chaos. On the other hand, Western donors are almost certain to lose the hard-earned benefits of their stabilization efforts if the northeast’s agricultural production collapses due to the water crisis. Addressing issues like the flow of the Euphrates River would also have a transboundary halo effect, helping to ease tensions between Syria and Iraq that have arisen from the two countries’ water shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no miracle solution, but there are many policies that can help northeastern Syria and any future government in Damascus navigate this crisis. Donors and their partners could immediately implement some of these short-term, pragmatic interventions at marginal cost to correct the unsustainable trajectory of existing aid interventions. Such policies, as outlined above, include experimenting with ways to support rain-fed farmers and pastoralists, greater coordination among aid actors and with local authorities when planning groundwater extraction projects, and stronger commitments to do no harm by planning boreholes more wisely, investing in groundwater monitoring, and improving waste disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other solutions, while entirely feasible, will require a scale-up of donors’ financial and political commitments. The absolute priority is to improve waste and wastewater management, a lack of which has greatly harmed soils, surface water, and groundwater. Here, again, there is a wide spectrum of potential interventions, including the regulation of imports, usage of pesticides and fertilizers, relocation of informal landfills away from potable water aquifers and riverbeds, and multimillion-dollar projects to build engineered landfills and wastewater treatment plants. While significant, these investments could also have positive effects further downstream, in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the political side, donors should lift NGO barriers to cooperation with the AANES and any future local governing body. These barriers are primarily political but retaining such barriers for NGOs make little sense for long-term stability. For too long, NGOs have been caught in a delicate balancing act of trying to reform the agricultural sector’s water-intensive practices without working with the main actor in charge of regulating them. Thus, many opportunities to support the water sector have been squandered due to red tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Western states and Arab allies need to prioritize diplomacy with Turkey and should urge it to release more water from the Euphrates River for both Iraq and Syria. This remains the most effective way to alleviate immediate pressure on Syria’s water resources. Strengthened regional diplomacy could also ensure that Turkey is not damaging a downstream ally, Iraq, through its punishment of Syria. Diplomacy would also help secure any future investments and existing food and water supplies from Turkish attacks, which threaten Syria’s environment—and thus its stability—over the long term. Now, perhaps more than at any previous time during the conflict, there is a need to finalize a peace agreement between Turkey and the leaders of the AANES and formalize the AANES’s relations with the central government. The United States will be instrumental in mitigating violence and inequity that could further hinder efforts to better manage water: this essential and increasingly scarce resource in Syria. The fall of the Assad regime provides a historic window of opportunity to improve conditions in Syria. But if it is not seized with longer-term diplomatic and financial investment, it could lead to further crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until significant steps are taken to address the water crisis, villages will continue to empty as Syria’s breadbasket turns into a hollow shell, creating a vacuum that is only likely to strengthen extremist groups’ hold in the region and lead more Syrians to leave the country. “If there was no war and no drought, this village would have a hundred young men. But only 15 are left because everyone is gone to northern Iraq, Turkey, or Europe,” said one rain-fed farmer in the countryside of Derik, near the border with Iraq. Facing the worst drought he can remember, he has gradually sent all his children away—some to bigger cities in Syria, and one to Germany. “Most families in this village have a relative in Europe. Without them, the people here wouldn’t survive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-2&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Tahrir Square in Sana’a, the capital of Yemen, was inundated with thousands of people protesting the 30-year rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The protests eventually led to a war that shook the foundations of the country and led to Saleh’s removal. Thirteen years later, Tahrir—Sana’a’s most iconic square—was inundated with water. Heavy rains and years of neglected infrastructure led to massive floods, submerging cars and homes and turning the square into a small lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not the first time. From April to August 2020, heavy rains and floods affected hundreds of thousands of families across Yemen, including in the Sana’a region. The 2020 heavy rains converged on the city from all directions, flowing over the brims of dams such as the Shahik and flooding the old city of Sana’a, a UNESCO world heritage site. Years of war and neglect rendered the city ill-prepared for the intense rains. The floods swept solid waste that had accumulated in storm drainage canals through Al Sayla, in the heart of Sana’a. The waters also entered sewage pipelines, causing them to overflow. The impact was particularly devastating due to the years of war that had forced thousands of people from around the country into Sana’a, driving the spread of unregulated construction projects and increasing waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While destructive flooding gives the impression of plentiful water, Sana’a is also, counterintuitively, severely water scarce. In fact, many of the dams around Sana’a were dry in the years before the 2020 rainstorms. During periods of heavy rainfall, there is no time for water to seep into the earth and to recharge depleted underground aquifers; instead, floodwaters run into the desert and evaporate. Floods have become a serious climate risk in Yemen: the United Nations estimates that over half a million people were severely affected by the unprecedented floods of August 2024, with many tens of thousands living without shelter in the Sana’a area during an associated cholera outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water insecurity is now shaking the foundations of Yemen and could prevent a sustainable peace. Conflict over water resources—and the conflict’s impact on water resources—would further destabilize the country and lead to outward migration. But despite the urgency of the situation, confronting water insecurity has been challenging for governing authorities and donors. In addition to the insecurity bred by the war itself, aid access constraints, vested interests, and donor regulations have hindered the ability of NGOs and UN agencies to confront the problem. Many Western and Gulf governments consider the Houthis, the armed group that took control of Sana’a during the war, a terrorist organization. And the Houthis themselves have made aid work difficult. Since Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the Houthis have also launched attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea in support of Palestinians during Israel’s military offensive in Gaza. This has done even more harm to the Houthis’ efforts to ingratiate themselves with the international community to support peace talks and greater investment and aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While governance is part of Sana’a’s water insecurity problem, climate change and the city’s location also make it particularly vulnerable. With or without war, water insecurity is expected to worsen. Though there is limited data available, extreme weather events in Yemen—such as storms, droughts, and flash floods—appear to be growing more severe and frequent, with devastating effects. These extreme weather events wipe out houses and farmland, upend livelihoods, displace families, and kill people. More severe storms have also destroyed deteriorating dams that Yemenis have depended on to control and exploit water. Projections suggest there will be further changes to rainfall patterns and temperatures, bringing increased drought and desertification, which are being exacerbated in turn by the overextraction of groundwater for irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;

Projections suggest there will be further changes to rainfall patterns and temperatures, bringing increased drought and desertification, which are being exacerbated in turn by the overextraction of groundwater for irrigation. Yemen’s water insecurity significantly aggravates its already tenuous situation; it is the second-most fragile out of 179 countries surveyed worldwide. These issues highlight both the challenge and the necessity of finding ways to confront Sana’a’s water insecurity even in times of war. Sana’a sits atop one of the major groundwater basins in Yemen, which spans around 3,200 square kilometers. The Sana’a region is also one of Yemen’s largest agricultural regions, representing 11–13 percent of total crop area. The basin is the source of water and agriculture for millions of Yemenis, including three million in the rapidly growing capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the basin’s historical and socioeconomic importance, and the intense environmental and anthropogenic pressures on it, donors, aid agencies, and technocrats are struggling to develop solutions to the water crisis as the war drags on. Groundwater overuse, pollution, and climate variability have overwhelmed the capacities of current governmental water institutions. Many interlocutors have said that greater assistance will be delayed until the war ends or a different government takes power in the capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the severe degradation of the Sana’a basin cannot wait for an imperfect peace deal. In any case, the Houthi armed group that controls Sana’a and other parts of northern Yemen may remain in power after a peace agreement, which is unlikely to address water issues. Even when peace negotiations were active in early 2023, they did not include water governance or support. And Sana’a’s future as a capital will depend on the ability to provide affordable water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a united approach, regional and international donor governments could press for vital water reforms and support water infrastructure development in Sana’a. Currently, there is no clear strategy or coordination among donors supporting Yemen. However, starting with elemental steps toward water security, donors—together with local stakeholders—could build the trust needed to set the framework for broader reforms in the future. That framework would both lead to a more sustainable peace when an agreement comes and have positive effects on health, food security, and livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explains how and why a partnership between a coalition of donors could embed water solutions within a broader strategy for economic development in the region. It highlights politically feasible reforms and solutions that could be implemented using the combined leverage of the traditional donor government community, in concert with Arab Gulf donors who seek an end to instability in Yemen. Through politically feasible projects, a strategy for future water policies and investments can emerge. In the short run, projects can build on past reforms and improve water cooperation in the Sana’a basin through capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long-term impact, the government—with the support of donors—needs to expand reforms beyond the purview of the core technical experts who are still employed within various ministries in Sana’a. By reaching out to local stakeholders and decisionmakers within the government who may lack the technical knowledge to approve projects, aid agencies, multilateral organizations, and donors could develop programs with the right mix of carrots and sticks to bring Sana’a back from the brink. Future reforms could then address agriculture, which accounts for nearly 90 percent of water usage in the country. Supporting more sustainable rural livelihoods will slow the rapid depletion of groundwater in the Sana’a basin. For this, donors can build coalitions with political and traditional elites in Yemen, as well as in water sector institutions. While these solutions are not a silver bullet, they can put sustainable water management in the Sana’a region on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter starts by providing a background on Sana’a’s water governance and insecurity before and during the war. It then assesses donors’ roles in the water sector and their current reticence to get involved, given Sana’a’s difficult governing authorities and ongoing instability. The chapter will argue, however, that starting with Sana’a’s water and sanitation sectors is important and feasible. The chapter will conclude by suggesting a series of short- and long-term steps toward greater water security through the combined leverage of regional and international donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people of Sana’a have long had to fight water insecurity, in part due to geography. At 2,300 meters above sea level, Sana’a abuts some of the highest mountains on the Arabian Peninsula and is surrounded by smaller ranges. Since ancient times, Yemenis have built dams to collect water for agriculture and for the protection of Sana’a, which lies in the valley of the mountains. Some of these dams date back to pre-Islamic civilizations, such as the Shahik, which sits in Jabal al Lawz at an astonishing 3,344 meters above sea level. In the decades before the war, donors—including USAID and the Arab Fund in Kuwait—supported the development of channels for draining flood water in Sana’a. They also supported the rehabilitation and construction of dams as well as improved irrigation around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s and 1990s, Yemen also expanded irrigated agriculture, which caused the country to become increasingly water scarce. Starting in the 1970s, many Yemenis from the countryside migrated to the Gulf, reducing the workforce for traditional agriculture. At the same time, the remittances sent by the Yemeni guest workers funded the modernization of agriculture, through mechanization and expanded irrigation. As traditional agricultural methods and water-saving techniques like rainwater harvesting fell out of fashion, Yemen’s lack of rivers often led irrigators to draw out groundwater. But it was soon clear that high levels of groundwater abstraction were not sustainable and that the government needed a more coherent approach to water management. This scarcity was further aggravated by the need to support a rapidly growing population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the outbreak of the most recent war in 2014, many observers saw the complete depletion of the Sana’a basin as imminent. Experts warned that the city in particular could be the world’s first modern capital to run out of water. The groundwater depletion rate is now very high in zones across Yemen; the hardest-hit area is the highlands, where scientists have recorded annual water table declines of between two and six meters per year in the Sa’dah, Rada’a, Taiz, Amram, and Sana’a basins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 1990s and early 2000s, several water institutions were established with the help of donors and based on the concept of integrated water resources management (IWRM). IWRM regards water problems as a reflection of fragmented responsibilities and a lack of laws and strategies. The IWRM reform process led to the creation of a separate Water and Environment Ministry (MWE), a National Water Resources Authority (NWRA), a National Water Law, and an ambitious national five-year strategy (2005–2009) with a $1.5 billion investment program designed mainly to support the municipal water sector and decentralized water utilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OQlmO2O.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: Increase in Irrigated Land in Yemen, 1961–2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sana’a Basin Committee, established in 2003 as part of the NWRA Sana’a branch, was a particularly important partner. Supported by donors like the World Bank, the basin committee was assigned to establish a binding plan to quantify existing water resources and develop future water-regulation investments and strategies for the Sana’a basin, accomplishing this through negotiation among all water users and relevant civil society actors. But the war and successive natural disasters disrupted these reforms as well as more recent donor efforts like the World Bank’s Integrated Urban Services Emergency Project, which is aimed at restoring basic urban services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet in 2015, after years of unrest, the Houthis expelled the recognized government from the capital. The Houthis themselves originate from Sa’dah, a region that had been facing severe water scarcity, which might have played a role in the militia’s expansion southwards. Today, the Houthis (an Iran-backed group, known among members as Ansar Allah) control a large proportion of the mountainous and densely populated areas in the northern and central parts of the country. These areas of control include some of Yemen’s water-stressed regions, such as Sana’a, Sa’dah, and Rada’a. Yemen’s second-largest city, Taiz, which is controlled in part by the Houthis and in part by the Internationally Recognized Government (IRG), also experiences frequent water shortages. The IRG, backed by a Saudi and Emirati-led coalition of Arab nations, also controls the southern governorates and has a presence in the governorates of al-Jawf, Hajjah, and Marib. In April 2022, a truce was announced, essentially freezing these lines of control but not opening the door to greater investment in Sana’a.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active fighting has complicated water security, but so has the Houthis’ reputation among donor governments. The United States designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist group in 2021. That designation was reversed in 2022, in part to facilitate aid and commerce to the region, but the Houthis were newly classified in 2024 as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist Group”—a different categorization with different consequences—after they began attacking shipping vessels in the Red Sea. The Trump administration re-designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist group in January 2025. Now, the prospects for imminent peace seem even less realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these developments, promising water sector reforms were cut short by the direct and indirect effects of war. Many of the water institutions (e.g., the MWE and NWRA) have existed for less than 20 years, a period largely overshadowed by war and political turmoil. The current war has interrupted institutional build-up in the Yemeni water sector, which had been improving the performance of utilities and overall water governance. Other reforms related to the creation of water laws, strategies, and new institutions had little chance of being implemented during the war. The centralized governance style of the Houthis also largely sidelined the Sana’a Basin Committee, whose model was based on collective decisionmaking. However, the committee has continued to function as a hub for knowledge and data on the water basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While dependence on agriculture—Yemen’s most water-intensive sector—has decreased due to war and water insecurity, water consumption has not. Only a third of the Yemeni population is employed in agriculture, down from over 50 percent prior to the war. In the Sana’a region, livelihoods that depend on agriculture have also decreased due to the high urbanization rate of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite decreased food production and support for livelihoods, unsustainable and water-intensive cropping patterns have increased since 2015—including the cultivation of qat, which was responsible for 25–43 percent of agricultural water abstraction in the basin in 2018, up from 15–30 percent in 2007. Qat is a plant that Yemenis regularly chew as a mild stimulant; it is water intensive mainly because it is planted and harvested year-round. As a result of these trends, agriculture’s contribution to GDP has risen once again to a third of Yemen’s current weakened economic output, up from around 10 percent in 2011, despite contributing less to livelihoods and food security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such an environment, weakened water institutions have been unable to confront the overabstraction of precious groundwater. As a result, residents in most urban areas are living with extreme water scarcity. At the best of times, daily municipal water withdrawals are capped at 50 liters per capita per day, but this figure does not account for network losses of up to and over 50 percent. In 2020, those living in Sana’a city were receiving between 15–20 liters of water per day and sometimes as low as 3 liters, well below the World Health Organization’s threshold of 15 liters per day in emergency situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these factors have increased inequity in water provision, augmenting social tensions and straining livelihoods and health. Urban water and wastewater services have deteriorated markedly, increasing reliance on expensive water from private tanks, with prices up to $4 per cubic meter in Sana’a. The heavy reliance on trucked water and the degradation of sanitation services has also made outbreaks of cholera more frequent and predictable. In 2017 and 2019, respectively, Yemen accounted for 84 percent and 93 percent of all cholera cases worldwide. As humanitarian aid dwindles, especially for Sana’a, health-focused NGOs are seeing cholera cases emerging in multiple provinces. In the meantime, elites in Sana’a drill ever-deeper wells to reach depleted groundwater, while others subsist on rations and are forced to leave their farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As water disappears, the likelihood of a larger confrontation over it becomes more likely. Warring parties have already weaponized water, cutting off various segments of the population from access to it. Tribal feuds over water are reportedly increasing. Despite the urgency of water scarcity in these areas, more effective water management and reforms have been put on hold during the most recent conflict. However, the war in Yemen has now entered a stage of stagnation, with occasional bursts of violence that might recur for some time; in the meantime, and the Sana’a basin risks complete collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desperate water situation in Sana’a and the surrounding rural areas has increased political pressure on the Houthis to act. Influential tribal forces in the region are beginning to voice discontent. This opposition force, originating among tribes around Sana’a, was allied with Ali Abdullah Saleh’s government but switched to an opportunistic alliance with the Houthis after the latter killed Saleh in 2017. A part of Saleh’s political party, Al-Motamar, even decided to remain in Sana’a and work with the Houthis against the Saudi-led coalition. But now the party in Sana’a has been publicly demanding that the Houthis invest in the workforce and pay civil servants’ salaries. In September 2023, there were rare large protests against the Houthis’ undermining of the state’s institutions. In this context, capacity building and small-scale infrastructure rehabilitation projects would likely receive wide support from the Sana’a region’s powerful tribes, which the Houthis depend on for support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While withdrawing from Houthi-controlled areas and focusing on IRG-controlled areas may be more politically palatable for donors, it will not be sufficient to curb instability in the country. Fixing the degradation of water infrastructure in the Sana’a region is a project that cannot wait any longer, and donors have leverage to act now through humanitarian and development aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-a-coalition-for-water-aid-in-yemen&quot;&gt;Building a Coalition for Water Aid in Yemen&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both regional and international stakeholders, as well as Yemen’s major donors, understand the importance of aid in stabilizing the country. Most of the oil-rich Gulf donor governments, along with European countries and the United States, seek to counteract Iran’s influence and curb emigration and the rebirth of transnational terrorist groups. As such, these donors have given generously to Yemen in the past. However, disparate aid efforts have struggled to gain the political concessions that would make the sum total of these efforts most effective. Regional and international donors could work together to provide more cost-effective assistance to the water sector in the Sana’a region in a way that could be mutually beneficial. Given the amount of support provided to Yemen over the years, the impact of more coordinated assistance would be substantial and would make future peace more possible. In the case of a rapprochement with the Houthis, regional donors might have the financial leverage to offer aid in return for better water governance in Sana’a.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aid provision has been substantial. In 2022, Yemen was among the top 20 recipients of official development assistance. Alongside sizeable humanitarian aid, Gulf donors are involved in development aid to Yemen’s water sector, primarily in IRG-controlled areas. After the formation of the Presidential Leadership Council (a new IRG executive body) in 2022, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) pledged $3.6 billion, including hundreds of millions in development aid, to cities in IRG-held areas. From 2015 to 2020, the UAE provided more than $6 billion in aid to Yemen, mostly to support public services. In the water sector, the UAE is supporting the construction of a small desalination plant in Aden—Yemen’s interim capital—that will produce around 10,000 cubic meters per day; the UAE has also promised to develop a clean energy project to enhance the use of water resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Saudi Arabia and the UAE have focused on IRG-held areas, Qatar—which is officially neutral in the armed conflict—has supported humanitarian projects in contested areas such as Taiz. In 2023, Qatar also announced a $15 million donation to UNICEF to improve water and sanitation services in several cities across Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and European countries have provided a great deal of support to Yemen even prior to the current conflict. They made the overwhelming majority of pledges in the Yemen High-Level Pledging (HLP) conferences of 2022 and 2023, which brought in $1.3 and $1.2 billion, respectively. While the HLP is related to humanitarian rather than development aid, these vast sums show that donors can still mobilize funds for Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite generous past donations, recent aid cuts, particularly in northern Yemen, now threaten to further destabilize the country. In December 2023, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) announced that it would pause the distribution of food aid to needy families living under Houthi control. Though this aid was partially resumed in mid-2024, President Donald Trump’s decision to temporarily freeze foreign assistance in 2025 can reverse these gains for the most vulnerable communities. Aid, totaling approximately $0.8 billion in 2023, went to humanitarian sectors, such as emergency food assistance dispersed through the WFP. Yemen is now competing for aid with numerous other countries in crisis, which has forced Yemenis and aid agencies to do more with less support. At the same time, the Houthis’ terrorism designation and lack of international recognition has also created obstacles. In September 2024, the United Nations decided to cut back some of its activities in Yemen after the Houthis cracked down on humanitarian and developmental workers, accusing them of spying for the United States and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Kuwait could become the most significant contributors to Yemen’s future stability. These countries have the direct political motivation to stabilize their neighbor, as well as the capacity to do so. Gulf countries have become important new donors on the international scene, with improved development cooperation and infrastructure financing. Some rich Gulf countries give more official development assistance, as a percentage of their economies, than more established Western donors. They also have strong experience in delivering water infrastructure projects to other countries, as shown in billions of dollars of Saudi and Emirati investments in Egypt’s ongoing water infrastructure projects. In late 2023, Saudi Arabia also announced the establishment of the Global Water Organization, which aims to integrate with global aid efforts to address water sustainability. Saudi Arabia already allocated $6 billion to various development projects in the water and sanitation sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European donors, namely the Dutch and German development agencies, also have extensive experience providing significant technical and financial assistance to the water sector in Yemen, which received the second-largest share of aid before the political turmoil of 2011. Between 2002 and 2009, water sector assistance to Yemen increased from $36 million to $52 million, with Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Japan, the UAE, and others contributing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the combined leverage and expertise of regional and international donors, it is possible to mobilize funds for water development in Yemen and lower the risk of failed projects. Regional donors can play an important role, since they are already carrying some of the financial cost of the military conflict and the ensuing humanitarian crisis. Together with traditional Western donors, they can start designing capacity-building projects and setting the stage for broader water economy reforms in the region. Today, many aid projects in Yemen are single-donor funded and lack coordination. The lack of a strategy tying these aid efforts together diminishes the potential for synergies across their activities, and thus decreases their impact. This siloed approach also makes it easier for political elites to hinder or manipulate aid to suit their needs rather than the public good. For example, the Houthis have been accused of treating aid projects as cash cows by imposing taxes and transport fees, and even selling aid or demanding compensation for granting humanitarian access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a coordinated approach around water and sanitation support for the Sana’a region, donors can implement more conditionality and design a multisector approach by focusing on capacity building and infrastructure aid in both urban and rural areas. Lately, new platforms have emerged for improving coordination among donors and for linking humanitarian and development aid. As a step in this direction, the World Bank and the European Union recently established the Yemen Partner Group to coordinate the efforts of development actors through the creation of technical teams covering water and food. However, the work of such mechanisms has not been visible yet, and more coordination with Gulf donors is necessary. This kind of cooperation can withstand political forces in Yemen to a degree that is difficult for any single government to achieve alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-sanaa&quot;&gt;Why Sana’a?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While assistance has dwindled in recent years, most of stakeholders and donor governments share an interest in a stable Yemen that is not a source of mass emigration or terrorism. Achieving that necessitates prioritizing water resources in the Sana’a basin as well as in IRG-controlled areas. Otherwise, the water crisis in northern Yemen could eventually engulf the whole country as different regions compete for access to resources. There are also numerous other reasons to prioritize water management in the Sana’a region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing capacity building and water cooperation in the Sana’a region could have positive spillover effects on stability and environmental sustainability. Sana’a’s economic significance has arguably increased along with war-driven migration to the capital city, both from the conflict-affected areas in the south and from the now-affluent tribes affiliated with the Houthis. In 2004, Sana’a’s population numbered 2 million people; by 2024, that figure had reached 3.4 million. This number may be even higher, as displaced people have continued to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sana’a is also home to a generation of water professionals, often educated abroad, who have worked for many years in Yemen’s ministries and think tanks. It is also the heart of water education institutions like Sana’a University’s Water and Environment Center (WEC). Today, such centers still offer courses on water issues, but they are not equipped to perform as national hubs for water research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capital is also where most of the data and the technocrats of the former government reside. Water institutions like the Sana’a branch of NWRA and the Sana’a Water Supply and Sanitation Corporation (SWSLC)—the latter established during the reform process to decentralize and privatize the water sector—are also located in the capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sana’a has been the political center of Yemen for centuries, and regional powers still compete for influence over its elites and its powerful regional tribes who once formed the backbone of President Saleh’s coalition. As such, the Sana’a region needs to be included in any future peace, which will be sustainable only if water security is provided to the millions of people in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;where-to-start&quot;&gt;Where to Start&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that Yemenis, and those with an interest in stabilizing Yemen, need to deal with the dire water and sanitation situation in the Sana’a region. However, they will also need to acknowledge the political hurdles of doing so in Houthi-controlled areas during an ongoing war. Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping vessels in 2023 and 2024 have further isolated Sana’a. The Houthis have also been notorious for putting conditions on UN humanitarian agencies and being difficult in access negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While major reforms in such an environment will be challenging, there are steps that Yemenis, the local authorities, and donors can take to begin to put the region on the right path and prevent or delay a major water crisis. In the short term, building up capacity for water research and cooperation in Sana’a is feasible, in part because of the groundwork laid by numerous donors to build water expertise in the capital. And because the area is essentially controlled by one governing actor, it may even be more feasible to implement this and other steps in the Sana’a region than in the south, for instance, where the presence of numerous warlords make governance, security, and aid access even more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;capacity-and-trust-building&quot;&gt;Capacity and Trust Building&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aid designed to rehabilitate technical capacities (e.g., data collection and water utility monitoring) is a good first step to revitalize the water sector. Some of the professionals who participated in past reforms have fled the capital city or emigrated, but the key water institutions of Yemen, and many associated water experts, remain in Sana’a. Donor-led projects can capitalize on the presence of these experts by enhancing cooperation between local Yemenis and international experts and education centers. These local experts could begin to collectively gather data on the Sana’a basin that could inform future water policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of projects could also support the ongoing efforts of water management institutions (e.g., NWRA) to design basin-wide plans. Donors can also support the Sana’a Water Basin Committee to study the future plan for the basin and to act as a platform for water cooperation and dialogue. The committee’s work can also create leverage for donors, environmentalists, and water sector institutions—both local water utilities and national water agencies like the NWRA and MWE—to demand better water management from decisionmakers in government. Building up alliances between sustainability-minded actors could push the water agenda forward and create support for related interventions. Through such alliances, technocrats, researchers, and trained citizen scientists could complement remote monitoring of irrigation water with fieldwork to measure groundwater levels and quality. Such data would provide water institutions and donors with a baseline to assess priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technocrats, small rural farmers, urban communities, and development organizations also share an interest in countering the powers of the large area farmers. By strengthening the ties between these stakeholders, donors would also empower the Basin Committee, the NWRA, and local councils, thus mitigating conflicts. Many of these bodies, like the local councils, have historically acted as arbitrators of water conflicts. As such, development professionals have argued that empowering environmental institutions and supporting community-level environmental projects could help to resolve conflicts in a more sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These negotiations could speak to the Houthis’ desire to appear to be an actor that can better provide security and services to the Yemeni people. The Houthis have argued that, in areas under their control, people enjoy the absence of competing militias as well as a better economic situation, as the local currency value was three to four times that of the currency in IRG areas in 2024. In Aden, which was declared a temporary capital after the Houthis took over Sana’a, residents complain about insecurity and the lack of basic services like electricity. Still, the reform of water institutions in Houthi areas has been undermined by the lack of funds, as well as by political interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case with other government bodies in Houthis-controlled areas, the work of water institutions has been closely supervised by Houthi-appointed moshrefeen, or supervisors. But supporters of capacity building can engage with the Houthis, who are not indigenous to Sana’a and are not finding it easy to convince the capital’s diverse constituents of their governance capabilities. In order to maintain their reputation, local Houthi authorities have an interest, above all, in tackling water insecurity. And their ability to govern affects their broader security interests. In part to counter protests and regain their legitimacy, the Houthis have focused on external enemies: Israel and the United States. The Israeli government’s actions in Gaza since October 7 have allowed the Houthis—who were once losing popularity—to recruit new fighters in droves and distract the population from their own mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;urban-water-supply&quot;&gt;Urban Water Supply&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given recent cholera outbreaks and the abysmally low water consumption per capita in Yemen’s cities, improving the urban water supply in Sana’a should be prioritized as well. In the capital, a diverse group of private water tankers were delivering water to the majority of households even before the war—around 60 percent pre-conflict and 70 percent in 2017. But this practice is not well regulated. The World Bank has recommended improving collaboration between water institutions and private tankers to test and register water operations while gradually rehabilitating the municipal water network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local authorities, as intransigent as they have been on certain issues, have an interest in allowing for progress on water and sanitation. Since the 2022 ceasefire, the local population has been demanding improved services—especially clean water, which has become exorbitantly expensive and even dangerous, as unregulated private water tankers capture the market. More support and engagement with the SWSLC and the MWE, as well as its subordinate Environmental Protection Agency, could have immediate positive impacts on the urban water supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These institutions, however, lack the technical capacity and funds to regulate the private tanker markets alone. NGOs and donors could improve the situation by matching grants for replacing old tanks, creating an association of regulated private tankers, establishing a directory of regulated providers, and providing chlorine and water quality tests. The Houthis are accused of benefiting from the dysfunctional water supply in Sana’a by profiting off of the water tanker industry. However, the suggested measures will benefit both the water tankers and the consumers by improving the quality of the private water supply. With many water tankers present, consumers have the power to choose. If tankers are registered and certified, consumers will likely choose regulated ones, thus incentivizing more tankers to cooperate with authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;agriculture&quot;&gt;Agriculture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While improving the drinking supply would be a life-saving intervention, dealing with the agricultural sector’s water consumption is vital as well. Agricultural groundwater abstraction drives the largest percentage of water use in the Sana’a region; failing to curb its excesses has and will continue to cut into drinking water for millions. Although the Sana’a region’s population is largely urban, agriculture in the area still consumed 0.8–1.0 billion cubic meters in 2018, declining from 1.2–1.5 billion in 2007. This decline was largely linked to water scarcity and agricultural abandonment. Despite this trend, the agricultural sector still accounts for almost half of water demand in the Sana’a region. Failure to effectively manage agricultural water use could also further exacerbate food insecurity and poverty in a country that has already suffered from acute hunger for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, certain crops contribute to water scarcity without improving food security. Qat, for example, is a significant drain on water supplies and does not improve Yemen’s food security. However, curbing qat production is a complex issue. Because it provides high revenues year-round, it typically wins out over alternative crops. During the conflict, warring parties have also benefitted from qat production. The Houthis and their allies have increased taxes on qat, which can be sold within the country for hard currency—something that is difficult to obtain in Houthi-controlled areas, which have become increasingly isolated from international markets during the war. However, this same interest may force the Houthis into a more sustainable and cooperative approach toward improving water efficiency on farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2022 UN Development Programme report posited that the overexploitation of groundwater will only stop if it is completely depleted, or if drilling deeper wells and maintaining water quality become cost-prohibitive. This may be true, but that would be disastrous for Sana’a and the rest of the region as citizens and armed actors seek out water and better pastures elsewhere. Rescuing the basin after its collapse would be nearly impossible. Local authorities, however, could slow the trend toward basin closure and help communities adapt to a future with no or little groundwater resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolving the groundwater issue will require local authorities, communities, and donors to deal with over-abstraction in the agricultural sector—which means dealing with powerful agricultural interests. Directly regulating overconsumption may not be feasible in today’s Yemen. Due to the socioeconomic importance of agriculture and the political difficulties of limiting related water consumption, it will be important to improve efficiency through the provision of precision irrigation systems. Conserving water is particularly important for qat farmers, whose share of agricultural water in the Sana’a region has increased during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With time, it may even be possible to enforce regulations and policy reforms that have been difficult to implement. In this case, the heavy-handed and centralized control of the Houthis may be an asset. The government—including the ministries and the local councils—might be more willing than Saleh’s regime to enforce water consumption limitations. Saleh doled out favors to powerful tribal elites to maintain power, and this lenient position toward tribes limited the power of water institutions to regulate the tribes’ excessive water consumption. The Houthis, by contrast, have demonstrated that they are willing to impose regulations on tribes if they see the need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to practicing more sustainable farming techniques and accepting regulations, the rural population can also be oriented toward more sustainable livelihoods over the long term. Previous donor projects have incentivized climate-resilient agriculture or alternative livelihoods in sectors such as heritage and tourism. However, donors and local authorities have never had a coordinated strategy to orient the market away from water-intensive crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional donors are also in a position to develop market-oriented approaches to water security. The Gulf can put its trade relations with Yemen—and its millions of Yemeni workers—to use. Yemen has traditionally exported coffee and fruits from the Sana’a region to neighboring countries. Gulf countries can incentivize less water-intensive agriculture through guarantees for environmentally friendly crop sales to the Gulf and certification programs that could help commercialize sustainable products like coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanitarian and development actors should also make their interventions more sustainable. Some reports have noted that providing solar energy for pumping groundwater has become a moral hazard by encouraging excessive use of the resource. While some aid agencies saw solar power as a lifeline for communities that could not afford diesel pumping, the subsequent depletion of groundwater has also shown why solar energy use must be closely monitored and conditioned on water conservation. Successful cases from India demonstrate that linking support for solar energy to the installation of micro-irrigation systems can address the goals of water conservation and energy access in agriculture. Agricultural extension services can also provide community trainings on the use of these efficient technologies in small-scale farming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;decreasing-vulnerability-through-small-scale-projects&quot;&gt;Decreasing Vulnerability Through Small-Scale Projects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing methods to conserve and distribute storm or drainage water can also alleviate some of the competition over Yemen’s dwindling resources and mitigate the destructive impact of floods. For example, there are four watersheds in the Sana’a region that flow into wadis or into the capital city, causing destructive floods during heavy rains. Prior to the war, donors supported the construction of small dams for agriculture, aquifer recharge, and water flow control. Building on this work to rehabilitate the drainage canals in the Sana’a region could enhance water resources and alleviate flooding and health concerns. In particular, donors and local actors could prioritize the rehabilitation of the Al Sayla, a vital outlet in the heart of Old Sana’a, which has caused concern lately due to recurrent floods and a lack of waste collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in small dams and ponds that capture additional water flows could give communities more independence from expensive private water sources and alleviate pressures on groundwater, which accounted for 27 percent of irrigation in 2018. There are extensive water harvesting systems in the Sana’a region through open ponds, or birak, but the government has neglected them, contributing to groundwater depletion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In agricultural parts of the Sana’a region (e.g., the Bani al-Harith and Bani Hushaysh), farmers are increasingly unable to till their fields due to lack of water. Given the evidence of increasing scarcity and related conflict, local farmers and tribal actors are likely to support the rehabilitation of their traditional water harvesting systems. Many of these tribal communities around Sana’a have depended for centuries on rainwater-collection infrastructure for agriculture, non-drinking domestic purposes, and their livestock. These traditional methods fell out of favor with increased water pumping. However, during the war, rainwater harvesting was repopularized by necessity—a trend that local authorities and donors could capitalize on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the Sana’a region will need larger infrastructure investments to develop new sources of water and improve the circular water economy through the reuse of municipal and agricultural wastewater. Yemen could benefit from advancements in the Arab world, either in wastewater reusage or, as in Egypt, drainage for the reuse of agricultural water. For now, such large investments seem like a distant dream—but incorporating them into larger governance and peacebuilding efforts may be necessary to save the Sana’a region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the desperate water situation and the protracted nature of the conflict, Sana’a cannot wait for the uncertain prospects of a political compromise. Instead of postponing water reforms until a peace treaty is reached, regional and international donors can begin to lay the groundwork for a lasting stability by reducing the vulnerability of the population to climate change and water supply shortages. While large-scale developmental reforms may not be feasible now, donors can invest in small-scale water infrastructure in urban and rural areas, in coordination with strengthened local and basin-wide water institutions. These incentives could ease negotiations with local decisionmakers and communities on regulations of water quality and usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a water-secure future for the Sana’a region will be a gradual endeavor that begins by forming alliances with water stakeholders, building trust among these stakeholders, and increasing the participation of state institutions. Donor cooperation also creates the leverage needed to improve water governance in Sana’a. Such efforts will, in turn, improve security in Yemen and the region. When a peace deal arrives, having tackled the water issue will make that peace more lasting and environmentally sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent political turmoil has shown the importance of water issues in peace. As highlighted in 2023 and 2024, insecurity in Yemen has the potential to shift international markets and destabilize the world and neighboring states with strong trade, migration, and security linkages to Yemen. Tackling the roots of this instability necessitates tackling water insecurity in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International and Gulf donors have the financial means to alleviate water issues in Sana’a, the political and cultural center of one of the region’s most populous countries. Harmonizing Western donor strategies with those of Gulf countries can cement long-standing partnerships with the Arabian Peninsula at a time of international competition for influence over this vital region for world trade and international security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Uf6kXxG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For millennia, legendary civilizations rose through their ability to control and exploit the mighty Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. The people of southern Iraq, in particular, became wedded to the water, literally floating on top of seemingly endless marshlands covering an area nearly the size of Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities not only survived but flourished in this Fertile Crescent by learning to adapt to the floods every spring. As the snow on the highlands melted and increased the flows of the Euphrates and Tigris, communities downstream made use of the water and built their lives around it. But in just a few generations, everything has changed. The threat of water scarcity has now become existential for Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many internal and external factors are contributing to the scarcity, pollution, and salinization of Iraq’s ground and surface water. The rivers on which southern Iraq depends have been diverted and heavily polluted within and outside the country. While Iraq was the first to control the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, its upstream neighbors—Turkey and Iran—have since superseded Iraq, diverting and storing the waters within their borders, reducing downstream water supply to Iraq. At the same time, Iraq—accustomed to centuries of abundance—is still using flood agriculture and failing to preserve the quality of its diminishing waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing urgency for reform, conflicts, internal and external political disputes, and corruption have strained the government’s capacity to improve water resource management as well as its ability to adapt to climate change. If oil prices drop, Iraqi government revenues—which are 90 percent dependent on oil sales—will be unable to provide basic services like water and sanitation or absorb newly unemployed farmers in the public sector. Even with high oil prices, Iraq has stagnated at 0.67 on the Human Development Index, positioning the country at 134 out of 204 ranked countries and territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a land with as much familiarity with political violence as Iraq, the potential for explosive consequences in the near-term are very real. In some parts of the country, conflicts are already manifesting, whereas in others, people are still struggling to get by. In southern Iraq, the situation is particularly acute and potentially volatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all of Iraq is struggling, Basra, Iraq’s southernmost governorate, has become the poster child of Iraq’s water insecurity. The marshes and agricultural lands that once made the region famous are now desiccated. And the tensions between the haves (e.g., oil companies, urbanites) and the have-nots (e.g., smallholder farmers, marsh dwellers, and city newcomers) is growing. However, the stability of this governorate is also essential to the future of Iraq, as it is the source of over 70 percent of the country’s oil revenues and the host of Iraq’s major ports. Basra’s response to its water crisis serves as a poignant example of political action prompted by imminent threats, resulting in tangible progress. But while there have been some positive developments, the water situation is deteriorating faster than these modest improvements can keep up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the magnitude of the challenge, this chapter will first lay out how Iraq abruptly moved from conditions of water abundance to water scarcity, and why this history makes it particularly challenging to shift water usage behaviors and management practices. The second section will delve into the consequences of water insecurity for communities and explain some of the governance challenges behind the failure to tackle problems. The chapter will conclude with some of the government’s recent successes in Basra and what more could feasibly be done in the near term to mitigate a larger crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper argues that, at the very least, the government can improve its municipal water supply and prepare for greater urbanization. That focus is a grim acknowledgement of the political obstacles to broader reforms in Iraq, but the chapter still highlights important and feasible steps toward safeguarding the resource most essential to life—drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-abundance-to-water-scarcity&quot;&gt;From Abundance to Water Scarcity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just a few decades, the population of southern Iraq has gone from floating on water to eking out a living on ever-larger sections of parched earth. Water availability in Iraq dropped from nearly 5,000 cubic meters of renewable fresh water per capita in 1960 to 827 cubic meters in 2020—the definition of water scarcity. Iraq’s rapidly growing population, which is expected to nearly double by 2050, threatens to exacerbate that scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the drivers of the frequent and prolonged drought conditions in southern Iraq is climate change: scientists estimate that, because of climate change, the likelihood of drought in the Tigris-Euphrates river basin has increased from a 1-in-250-year event to a 1-in-10-year occurrence. Climate change is also expected to reduce the rivers’ flows, further affecting Basra. A 2017 climate modelling study sponsored by the UN Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (UNESCWA) determined that there is considerable uncertainty regarding future inflows to the basin due to climate change; some scientists have predicted that, by 2100, the flows of the Euphrates and Tigris will decrease by 30 and 60 percent, respectively. According to another study, just a one-degree Celsius increase would reduce water resources for nearly one-third of the irrigated land in Iraq by 2050, leading to a 17 percent drop in the demand for unskilled labor in a country already facing 16 percent unemployment. However, while climate change is a significant factor in increased temperatures and water scarcity, much of southern Iraq’s water insecurity is due to upstream water management and domestic water mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq depends on the Tigris and Euphrates, and their tributaries, for 98 percent of its water. For centuries, the flow of these rivers remained uninterrupted as they made their way to the Shatt al-Arab, passing through thousands of square kilometers of marshlands in southern Iraq that naturally filtered out toxins through reeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the second half of the twentieth century, to control the often-dangerous flows of the rivers, Iraq began artificially taming the water well ahead of its transboundary upstream neighbors. The Iraqi government constructed the Hindya Barrage in 1913 on the Euphrates, near the holy city of Karbala, and the Kut Barrage in the 1930s, on the southern reaches of the Tigris. Numerous other dams and barrages were built in the 1950s, forming artificial lakes. But these methods of control were relatively minor compared to what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few decades, Turkey, Iran, Syria, and Iraq have designed water management strategies to serve their individual, rather than collective, interests. Today, apart from the Greater Zab, a tributary to the Tigris River, all rivers and tributaries are dammed. Iraq struggles to fairly manage water even within its borders. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has planned for the construction of dozens of barrages and dams in northern Iraq without the consent of the central government. And with every commissioning of a new dam, dyke, or barrage, less water becomes available in southern Iraq. Still, damming and surface diversions of surface water are one some of the only ways the country has managed water. Even the 2014 Strategy for Water and Land Resources in Iraq (SWLRI), sponsored by the Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR), clearly stated that Iraq did not need major dams and proposed the construction of about 20 smaller dams in the country, most of which were for water-harvesting purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most egregious example of politics driving southern Iraq’s water crisis is former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein’s campaign to drain the marshes. Still, despite millions of dollars spent to rehabilitate the marshes, they are so battered that they can no longer handle the surge in southward-running waste. As rainfall becomes more erratic and populations grow in the most water-stressed region in the world, riparian countries are increasingly focused on maximizing their capacities for storing and diverting water. While some experts have given up on the marshes of southern Iraq, this unique ecosystem remains a symbol of deeper dysfunction and points to the critical need to address transboundary water sharing and internal management immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;iraqs-marshes&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Iraq’s Marshes.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the 1980s and 1990s, Saddam Hussein diverted water away from the wetlands to prepare the battlefield for war with Iran and to expose rebels hiding in the marsh reeds. Ninety percent of the marshes disappeared. The United Nations called the draining of Iraq’s wetlands “one of the world’s greatest environmental disasters.” It also led to mass displacement: hundreds of thousands of people lived in the marshes prior to Hussein’s campaign, but only 20,000 to 40,000 remained by 2006. Millions more in the southern governorates were also affected in some way, since 60 percent of those governates’ market fish and more than 40 percent of these regions’ dairy products came from the marshes.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A program to restore the marshes after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and overthrow of Saddam Hussein was reasonably successful until recently, when those gains were reversed by the reduction of water allocations for Iraq by neighboring riparian countries and by internal water mismanagement. However, the incredible initial comeback of the marshes just after 2003 showed that Iraq could battle catastrophic degradation if doing so was prioritized.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq’s solution to water insecurity during its centuries of water abundance—the erection of dams and dikes—is unlikely to save the country now. Dams and diversions in times of scarcity tend to increase tensions and inequity, with marginalized communities—especially small farm-holders and the marsh Arabs—suffering the most. Experts also point to the hundreds of illegal water diversions toward land owned by powerful and influential people, who use the water for fish farms or irrigation. But even when dikes are built to help farming and marsh communities, civil society questions the long-term impacts on the environment. In 2010, the MoWR agreed to erect a small earth dike across the Euphrates River near the city of Mdayna, north of Basra, to maintain a minimum water level in the river and its adjacent central marshes. While the dike was necessary to support the livelihoods of tens of thousands of farmers along the southern part of the Euphrates, including marsh-dwelling families, some activists and locals also argued that because the water quality arriving in Basra was already poor, a dike would only concentrate the river’s pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite decreasing flows of water and increasing concentrations of pollutants, Iraq continues to manage water as if its resources were infinite. Iraq doubled its irrigated land between 1990 and 2020, using the same water-intensive flood irrigation employed in ancient Sumer. While the former abundance of water diluted salts, sewage, and contaminants, decreased water levels have concentrated these pollutants, making the remaining water unusable for humans, animals, and crops. Still, there are few, if any, wastewater plants that treat sewage even to a secondary level (i.e., doing more than simply filtering solid matter). Now, as surface fresh water becomes increasingly scarce, communities and farmers farther from the main rivers and tributaries are increasingly relying on groundwater and expensive water trucking. In parts of Najaf, the water table has dropped between 12 and 15 meters in a single season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical water abundance is now part of the challenge. The Iraqi government will have to push a society accustomed to plentiful water and flood agriculture for thousands of years to become one that overcomes water scarcity, especially in hard-hit southern Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-consequences-of-the-water-crisis-in-southern-iraq&quot;&gt;The Consequences of the Water Crisis in Southern Iraq&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water crisis has devastated communities in southern Iraq. Many farming families have gone from temporarily adapting to dry years by farming less land and killing off their livestock to permanently moving away, breaking apart social networks that have already endured decades of socio-economic traumas ranging from near-constant war to government collapses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South Basra Environmental Directorate reported that water degradation in the governorate cost Iraq $400 million in lost animals, palm trees, and crops in 2018 alone. The diminishing water levels in the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, as well as seawater intrusion from the south toward al-Qurna in northern Basra, have dramatically increased soil salinity. In 2022, the United Nations reported that this resulted in the destruction of more than 60,000 acres of agricultural land and the loss of 30,000 trees. The head of the Agricultural Engineers Syndicate reported in 2018 that salinity and water scarcity had eliminated 87 percent of Basra governorate’s 20,000 square kilometers (7,700 sq. miles) of arable land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences have been particularly acute for Iraq’s marshes. According to the MoWR’s Center for Restoration of the Iraqi Marshes and Wetlands, nearly 70 percent of the marshlands’ water has dried up, making the salinization even worse. In Al Chibayish marsh in northwest Basra, for example, salinity levels ranged between 2,300 to 3,000 ppm in July 2021; by July 2023, the salinity doubled, surpassing 6,000 ppm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water scarcity, salinity, and pollution have significantly decreased local fish and buffalo numbers. Tens of thousands of fish in southern Iraq are killed during the summer months as water fails to reach the south or becomes too saline for the fish to survive. Buffalo farmers are increasingly finding their herds stuck in the mud of dissipating streams and sickening from lack of fresh water. Some estimate that Iraq has lost 80 percent of its original buffalo population. Inhabitants of the Hawizeh marsh in southeast Iraq have struggled to secure even basic water supplies for domestic use. While there are numerous reasons for the decrease in water levels, including a major Iran-built dam on the Al Karkheh River in 2009, frustrated residents have threatened to march on nearby oil companies to shut down their operations and demand that government take action to curb the companies’ water usage, which involved pumping up to three barrels of water into the ground for every barrel of oil produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often than not, however, these communities are unable to confront powerful economic and political players. Most people cope in any way they can. To sustain their crops and livestock, some have resorted to purchasing expensive water from tanker trucks. Many families have been forced to sell off surviving livestock, losing a lifetime of assets in the process. More and more families who depend on fishing and animal husbandry have either moved to the north, toward Baghdad (on the Tigris) or Najaf (on the Euphrates); some have gone farther south to Basra, with the hope that conditions will be more conducive to their livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between January 2016 and October 2022, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), water insecurity and environmental degradation displaced more than 55,000 people in central and southern Iraq. This figure represents approximately 15 percent of the previous population of these areas. Notably, the governorates of Thi-Qar, Missan, and Qadissiya, which host large farming communities, witnessed the highest displacement rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of a proper governmental response to the crisis has led to increased displacement and conflict over water, resources, and services. As men, and then entire households, move to urban centers for better labor opportunities, they face another set of challenges. The lack of planning and assistance for both host communities and the displaced has exacerbated instability. Farmers, accustomed to rural life, find themselves living in smaller, crowded spaces, socially marginalized, and facing discrimination in housing and education. In lieu of adequate housing for these newcomers, informal neighborhoods have rapidly expanded. The government typically underserves these communities, and many urbanites regard them as hubs for criminality. Even environmental activists from Basra and Amara have attributed the escalating drug trade in border regions to drought and a lack of job opportunities for displaced families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq has been unable to accommodate its growing urban population. In 2011, housing shortages affected less than 10 percent of Iraqis. By 2024, the housing shortage was estimated to be in excess of 3 million units—a number thought to affect a quarter of the Iraqi population. To address the housing and services shortages, the current Iraqi government has been keen to allow private contractors to invest in the construction of residential complexes. However, the unprecedented support for these efforts—in the form of cheap land acquisitions and lavish loans to certain investors and developers—has been marred by corruption, making most new housing unaffordable for the average family. For example, well-connected individuals can take property deeds to banks and deposit them as security for loans totaling three to five times the property’s value, and then use the cash for new acquisitions. In November 2022, the current government’s Council of Ministers approved decision No. 320, which allowed for development of buildings on agricultural land. However, this changing of land-use patterns comes at the cost of fertile areas and further disturbs the country’s fragile food market. These actions are unlikely to close the gaps in housing supply and basic services and may even cause further environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social and political tensions over water scarcity have now reached a dangerous pitch in Iraq, which is still fragile from decades of war and entrenched mistrust, both between internal communities and with neighboring countries. Increased tensions have occasionally led to conflict, particularly among tribes in Maysan and north Basra. In 2017, tribes in the southern governorate of Al-Muthanna threatened war with others in Diwaniya governorate who had exceeded their fair share of water; in 2021, one official in Dhi Qar warned that local authorities feared tribal conflict could break out at any time. Rather than levelling the playing field, however, this competition often comes at the expense of impoverished farmers who have lost their access to water—and their farms and livelihoods along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central government, municipal governments, and communities also trade accusations of who is responsible for water scarcity. Rice farmers in the central governorates of Najaf and Diwaniyah, for example, accuse the central authorities of diverting their water to sustain the southern marshes, while marsh inhabitants accuse rice growers in these middle Euphrates governorates of consuming large quantities of water, preventing the rivers from flowing into the marshes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water scarcity has also led to tensions between rural communities and between farmers and oil companies, which need water for non-drinking purposes. Tribal leaders and influential locals frequently dig trenches or establish illegal wells to tap into shared resources when water levels get low. Local government officials are often powerless to stop them but also fear the outbreak of larger conflict as powerful individuals secure their own water at others’ expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Iraqi government does not reform water management to respond to scarcity while oil prices are high, the country may be heading for collapse, with underdevelopment and rising societal violence between armed tribesmen and militias in the years ahead. However, the governance challenges are very real. Understanding governance obstacles may allow Iraq to triage feasible and high-impact policies to address this critical moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance-challenges-contributing-to-water-insecurity&quot;&gt;Governance Challenges Contributing to Water Insecurity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraqi politics and governance, especially in the past three decades, have become the biggest impediments to water security. Even transboundary issues can, in part, be tied to Iraq’s governance challenges. While Iraq was embroiled in conflict or suffering under economic sanctions, the surrounding riparian countries strengthened their control over shared rivers and tributaries. During these years, a struggling Iraqi government had more immediate priorities than securing fair and binding international agreements with Turkey and Iran. A fragile and fractured Iraq also could not prioritize long-term water and sanitation needs or improve water management practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main impediment to prioritizing water is simple. Water is cheap, if not free, across Iraq, even though water and sanitation infrastructure is expensive and requires constant maintenance. As such, the management of water and sanitation tends to fall low on the government’s priority list. Wastewater treatment is a particularly egregious example of this political problem. Such treatment is socially and economically beneficial, protecting people’s health and the environment they depend on, but presents no immediate benefit for politicians seeking flashy, popularity-boosting projects that will get them reelected. As such, Iraq spends less than it should on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). WASH spending ranged from 0.47 percent of the government’s total operational expenditures in 2018 to just 0.72 percent of total expenditures in 2021. The government would need to spend approximately 4 percent of its usual expenditure to achieve universal access to safely managed WASH services by 2030. Taking population growth into consideration, the financing gap between available resources for public WASH services and the resources needed to achieve universal access to such facilities will more than double between 2022 and 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the low levels of spending on basic services, there have been significant delays in allocating the minimal resources available. Iraqi politicians have regularly delayed the implementation of reforms and infrastructure investments in order to safeguard their political gains and interests. Tensions between the central government, the KRG, and other local authorities, in addition to disagreements between political factions, have significantly delayed budget provisions for water services. In 2021, due to political skirmishes, the national budget was not approved. In 2023, the budget was not approved until June because of a disagreement over the sale and distribution of oil and gas revenues. This delay resulted in many projects not coming to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to broader government dysfunction, Iraq’s water sector is fragmented. It encompasses many stakeholders, including the MoWR; the Ministry of Construction, Municipalities and Public Works; the Baghdad Mayoralty; the Ministry of Agriculture; the KRG; and local authorities at the governorate levels. The functions of all these entities overlap and often work at cross-purposes, making it difficult for southern governorates, or any one entity, to take control of and responsibility for a project from planning to operation. This leads to significant delays and lack of accountability. For example, when contaminated drinking water sent 118,000 people to hospitals in Basra in 2018, the Water Directorate and local politicians tried to shift the blame to the MoWR, which is responsible for water supply but not for the maintenance of the distribution system, which was the source of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tensions also rise when the governorates’ Water Directorates demand more water allocation than the MoWR is able to give, or when local authorities demand more autonomy over infrastructure projects. The disconnect between the needs of the governorates and the central administration’s authority to dole out funds is partially a remnant of the post-conflict reconstruction that followed the U.S. government overthrow of the Ba’athist government. After the 2003 U.S. invasion and occupation, the Iraqi government was decentralized under the tutelage of the United States. The de-Ba’athification process created a vacuum when Ba’athist bureaucrats and technocrats were essentially thrown out of government. A country that used to be centrally controlled was suddenly transformed into a decentralized apparatus, leaving sizable gray areas between the entrenched central authority and the burgeoning, capacity-deficient local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donors and the government have since tried to reform the bureaucracy and bridge local and central actors in various ways. In the water sector, this effort has centered on the creation of a National Water Council (NWC). The NWC was supposed to be responsible for devising and leading strategic water reforms, implementing climate change adaptation measures, financing major desalination projects, and introducing water-saving technologies. In 2005, the final proposal for the NWC’s mandate was presented to the Iraqi government for approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the proposed NWC remains shelved for various reasons, including politicians’ watering down of the initial concept in subsequent negotiations. Rather than creating water management plans for the country, supervising the implementation of those plans, and allocating funds for strategic projects to ensure water sustainability, politicians attempted to turn the NWC into yet another bureaucratic body. As a result, the NWC would have implemented narrow projects instead of taking on a more holistic and influential role in determining the direction of the development of Iraq’s water resources, improving overall water management sustainability, and helping the country adapt to climate change. There were also no guarantees that the new NWC would be able to hire qualified, competent, and independent technocrats and experts, since politicians proposed filling its ranks with high-level government employees at the deputy minister and general director levels—excluding, or at least narrowing, the chances for independent experts to come in from outside the prevailing bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these challenges, instead of focusing on strategic and long-term solutions to water and sanitation, the country has found itself dealing with water issues in an ad hoc fashion, sometimes too late. The drinking water sector in southern Iraq is a casualty of this crisis-management approach. Despite acknowledgment of the need for desalination plants to supply Basra after the destruction of the city and the Shatt Al-Arab during the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, the Iraqi government did not diversify water sources. Basra’s drinking water still comes from two sources: the Shatt Al-Arab and the Sweet Water Canal (SWC), known locally as Bad’a Canal. The SWC is a 238-km-long open canal built in 1997 to convey fresh water from the Al-Gharaf River, north of the city of Nasiriyah, to the north of Basra. However, the government estimated that the SWC would only be serviceable for five years, during which time the administration was supposed to build major desalination plants. But the SWC, despite its fragility, is still in operation nearly three decades later. In the last few years, the MoWR has pushed to replace the open canal with expensive ductile pipes. The government spent millions of dollars to purchase the pipes, but the project has been delayed and the National Commission of Integrity has raised suspicions of corruption. A number of public servants within MoWR are currently under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iraqi government is beginning to understand and grapple with these issues as a threat to its hold on political power. Prime Minister Sudani ran on a platform in 2022 of delivering better services and fostering collaboration with local governments. The administration in Basra, for example, has succeeded in scaling up project implementation after feeling public pressure to provide better water and sanitation services after the city’s 2018 water contamination crisis. Politicians have begun to realize that improving water security is in their interests if they wish to survive. As such, there has been growing momentum for long-delayed projects, but much more needs to be done to systemically manage the vested interests that continue to plague Iraq’s water governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-bright-future-for-basra&quot;&gt;A Bright Future for Basra&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the situation in Iraq seems dire, the country has a major advantage compared to many others in the region that suffer from even more pronounced scarcity. Iraq has plentiful oil revenues to deal with the challenge. If it spends those revenues in the service of preserving fresh water, protecting its environment, introducing technologies to develop nonconventional water resources, and shifting the economy away from water-intensive sectors, Basra could survive growing scarcity and eventually prosper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financially and geographically, the city is the best-suited governorate to handle the challenges of providing water and sanitation services. It produces over 70 percent of Iraq’s oil and has six commercial ports and two land border crossings. In theory, Basra has ample extra-budgetary financial allocation from so-called “petrodollar” provisions designed to compensate the oil-producing governorate. Petrodollar funds and regional development allocations for Basra amounted to nearly $1.3 billion in 2023. This puts Basra in a better position to demand more budget allocations for infrastructure development. Politicians know that a stable, oil-rich Basra serves their political interests. And a stable Basra is one in which its most urgent problem, water, is addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basra can do little about the broader government paralysis or the water-intensive agricultural sector, which would take massive funding and political courage to change. Without broader investment, agriculture—particularly on the banks of Shatt Al-Arab—will remain unprofitable due to soil salinization. As a downstream province, there is also little that Basra can do to stop upstream communities from diverting and polluting the waters. Since the central government must negotiate transboundary issues, local authorities focus on improving the quality of the only waters that they have access to: the Shatt Al-Arab and the area’s groundwater, both of which are saline and heavily polluted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the country will need to drive a shift away from water-intensive agricultural practices and, in some places, away from traditional agriculture altogether. But in the meantime, ensuring clean water for all citizens, as well as adequate housing and jobs for those displaced by the water crisis, will be paramount. It may also be the most politically feasible path to walk today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MUNICIPAL WATER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water supply management is one of the few areas where the local government in Basra has had some recent wins. Recognizing that a stable Basra—the principal source of Iraq’s oil—is essential, Prime Minister Sudani’s government transferred the responsibility for implementing a major water initiative, the Great Basra Water Project, from the Ministry of Housing, Construction, Municipalities and Public Works to the local government of Basra. The Great Basra Water Project, funded by a $3 billion Japanese loan and launched in 2014, is aimed at supplying clean water for domestic use in Basra. While the project previously faced challenges such as delays in releasing funds, tribal conflicts, and political interference, it is now functioning at almost full capacity, supplying purified and desalinated water to northern and central Basra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plant with a capacity to desalinate 72,000 m³ (about 19 million gallons) of water per day from Shatt al Arab for the Abu Al Khaseeb district has now been operational since February 2022, and a desalination project for groundwater is under construction in Um Qasar, with a 1,000 m³/h capacity. Other proposed plans include the transference of water 80 km from Qurna District to the Shatt Al Arab and rehabilitating pipelines. These projects will decrease water losses from older pipelines that were fragile, outdated, and easily broken, all contributing factors to health issues and water wastage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, after years of delays, the central government has also handed over responsibility to the Basra authority for the construction of one of the largest seawater desalination plants in the world. A plant producing one mcm of water per day will be constructed at Fao, south of Basra. If implemented successfully, it will be the largest reverse osmosis (RO) purified water desalination plant in the world. There is finally progress on the project now, after years of delays due to corruption-related scandals. The Basra governorate awarded the multi-billion-dollar megaproject to a joint-venture of PowerChina, a Chinese company, and al-Ridha, a local company in 2024. The project is not cost-effective, since water will have to be pumped a long way to reach urban residents further north, but it is still welcome for many residents and politicians who have been waiting years for a boost to Iraq’s drinking water supply. In the future, since the central and local governments lack capacity to run large desalination and wastewater treatment plants, new potential projects should seek reputable contractors to construct plants based on a build-operate-transfer model to avoid potential financial and technical deficiencies and to train the next generation on the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While desalination projects alone cannot tackle all drivers of water insecurity, Basra authorities believe the only way they can address the crisis is by improving the quality of what they receive from the northern provinces and increasing supply through desalination. However, it will be equally important to convey potable water from treatment plants to distant city neighborhoods through a network of well-designed and -implemented transmission pipes. Therefore, investing in renovating both transmission pipelines and the overall distribution network will be essential to providing potable water from the yet-to-be-constructed desalination plants or from the existing conventional water treatment plants in the city. This may also reduce tensions between communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the government invests in a split system, where potable desalinated water is delivered via a new but smaller distribution network that functions parallel to the existing one, clean tap water could be provided to every kitchen and linked to a meter that would charge households accordingly. This could overcome three major obstacles to providing affordable and safe drinking water: vested interests, inefficient transmission networks, and cost. Currently, private water companies selling RO purified water have established a monopoly over this essential good and are charging exorbitant prices as a result. For example, some households in Basra pay between $60 and $148 a month on drinking and cooking water. In a country where the average monthly take-home pay is just $549, the cost is crippling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the government is now spending large sums to produce desalinated water, it still cannot guarantee the safe and efficient delivery of this resource because of outdated or damaged transmission and distribution networks. With this split system, prices would be far lower than bottled water yet would still encourage water-saving behavior through a metered system. The government could also encourage RO businesses to invest in the plan, co-opting those that may sabotage it. Most importantly, this strategy enables politicians to provide safe and cost-effective water services more efficiently, scoring them political points on a heated issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AGRICULTURE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been little progress made on a holistic plan to reform the agricultural sector in Iraq. Since around 75 percent of Iraq’s water is used in agriculture, this stagnation significantly impedes efforts to improve water security. The agricultural sector also has the potential to spark conflict between local authorities and the central government, as well as between communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constitutionally, the provision of water for agricultural purposes remains within the purview of the MoWR and the central government of Iraq. Local authorities in Basra, therefore, argue that they do not have the capacity or mandate to tackle the issue. Officials from the Directorate of Agriculture in Basra and the governorate’s parliamentary representatives complain that the Ministry of Agriculture does not provide sufficient financial backing for the provision of modern irrigation systems or equipment to Basra farmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Basra government has also largely neglected the agricultural sector. The administration turns a blind eye to the illicit sale of agricultural land—such as in areas like Abu Al Khaseeb—which is then repurposed for housing or commercial ventures. This lack of oversight is partly due to the government’s emphasis on economic growth and job creation for youth, who typically do not see agricultural work as appealing. It is possible that the government also does not regard farmers as crucial to the city’s stability. After all, it was urban residents who led the 2018 protests related to water contamination and the subsequent hospitalization of tens of thousands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet both the national government and Basra have made modest efforts to assist farmers. The MoWR allocated $300 million for the construction of the 128-km-long Basra Irrigation Canal, completed in 2017, to carry higher-quality water from the northern part of the Shatt Al-Arab to the south, aiming to irrigate about 100,000 dunums (around 39 square miles) on both sides of the river. The Basra government also established the Department of Plant Tissue Culture to spearhead the in-vitro propagation of date palms and other plant species capable of withstanding drought, heat, and salinization. While the department has successfully developed certain vegetables (e.g., tomatoes) as well as tree species (e.g., bananas), its outreach and impact have been underwhelming. According to a senior engineer at the department, a limited budget has constrained the department’s capacity and resources to expand production, market its products, and support farmers throughout the governorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater budget allocations from the central government could rehabilitate existing distribution networks, transmission pipes, and drainage infrastructure, as well as shift farmers to less water-intensive crops and irrigation methods. However, reforming the agricultural sector will take more than one-off infrastructure projects. Saving agriculture in Basra for small- and medium-sized farms is a monumental task that would require a systemic shift in crop selection, irrigation methods, and trade. These changes would require more fundamental changes to Iraq’s economy. The government would need to subsidize the planting of less water-intensive crops, protect drought-resistant crops with import tariffs, and encourage the import of water-intensive products. This could improve the situation for farmers more generally. Many of the goods produced in Iraq are already uncompetitive with regional imports due to high production costs, severe power shortages, and an open border through which uncontrolled and untaxed imports are regularly dumped on the country. Regulating trade could partially protect Iraqi markets and promote the import of virtual water (i.e., the amount of water used to produce goods and services throughout their value chain). But better-regulated trade in an age of endemic corruption will be challenging in the near term, as will efforts to systemically change agricultural practices that have existed in Iraq for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the local government will need to create social safety nets and support a larger ecosystem of job growth and urban development. Basra needs to explore tangible solutions for assisting farmers who have been forced to abandon agriculture and animal husbandry either temporarily or permanently. This could involve initiatives such as vocational training programs, increases in job compensation, and effective emergency interventions to sustain drought-stricken communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accommodate urbanization, the central and local governments should accelerate the development of urban areas to ensure that newcomers receive decent low-income housing and services, rather than criminalizing those forced to move to cities. The government will also need to protect remaining fertile areas and encourage the development of low-income housing in cities, rather than selling arable land to developers for considerable profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a number of housing compounds cater to low- and medium-income households, these mainly host government employees whose regular salaries allow them to afford monthly mortgage payments. For others, acquiring a government home loan is fraught. Bank transactions are still paper-based, which makes the sector convoluted for most Iraqis and susceptible to corruption. Iraq’s land and property registration processes are also paper-based, and data is not shared between government agencies. This dysfunctional system creates advantages for savvy businesspeople but does not serve ordinary Iraqis. Internet banking would increase transparency, alleviate the burden on understaffed banks, and open home ownership to more Iraqis. These latter two points could incentivize private developers to build low-income housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To alleviate the stress on water supplies and rural communities in drought years, local authorities, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the MoWR have compensated farmers to reduce the agricultural areas they cultivated. These initiatives have provided some relief to communities and may help to curb displacement and potential instability. However, land-use regulations and compensation typically do not apply to all farmers, especially smallholders. More powerful landowners tend to circumvent restrictions, diminishing the positive impact of austerity measures. Still, providing more of a social safety net, accompanied by longer-term assistance—through either alternative housing and jobs or the provision of drought-resistant seeds and irrigation systems—could ease the pain of scarce years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRANSBOUNDARY NEGOTIATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While transboundary relations are outside the purview of the southern governorates, improving water-sharing remains the most impactful way to improve water quality and quantity in Basra. To address external factors contributing to the water crisis, Iraq can leverage trade and other shared interests with Iran and Turkey to advocate for greater regional environmental cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central government could leverage trade and security agreements to turn transboundary negotiations from a zero-sum game to one in which Iraq, as a downstream country, is on more equal footing. The value of exports from Turkey to Iraq in 2022 was $13.8 billion, and in 2023, Iraq was Turkey’s third-largest trading partner. The recent Development Road Project, one of the 26 memorandums of understanding signed during Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s visit to Iraq in 2024, is another opportunity to expand negotiations over shared interests, including water resources. The project aims to establish a trade route connecting Basra to Turkey and eventually to Europe. Exploring how water could be incorporated into such agreements could further enhance economic cooperation, in addition to enhancing peace and stability. Turkey has also conducted military operations on Iraqi soil, targeting the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which Ankara considers to be a terrorist group. As much as possible, such cooperation or acquiescence by Iraq should be tied to greater water cooperation. This security relationship, as well as direct official Iraqi government requests, have already encouraged Ankara to release more water to Iraq during scarce years—but these are typically ad hoc arrangements. Agreements on transboundary water need to be adaptable medium- and long-term arrangements for equitable and reasonable water sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent wins with Iran on transboundary waters have also been tied to non-water-related issues. Water quality deterioration in the Shatt Al-Arab have largely been a result of Iran diverting the waters of the Karun and Karkheh rivers from Iraq, causing a sharp increase in water salinity due to sea water flowing into the Shatt al-Arab. In the summer of 2023, Iran released the Karun River to boost its alliance with Baghdad’s new regime, the Coordination Framework government, which was battling popular anger in Basra resulting from, among other issues, the deterioration of the Shatt Al-Arab. Typically, however, Iran refuses to communicate with Iraq over water issues. Connecting water to Iraq’s stability and to bilateral trade may convince Iran to be more consistently cooperative—but that seems unlikely, given Tehran’s extensive economic, military, and political influence over Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obligations under various other international conventions could also serve as a basis for negotiated arrangements on shared waters. In 2023, Iraq became the first Arab country to sign the 1992 UN Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (known as the UN Water Convention), highlighting its increased interest in water insecurity. While upstream countries are not party to the convention, they are parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD), the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. The states that are members of these conventions take on certain obligations that, if implemented in Iraq, would benefit the country. Annual international conferences of parties could also provide platforms for promoting Iraqi positions and securing international diplomatic and technical support from Iraq’s upstream neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoWR holds key responsibilities in maintaining Iraq’s fair water shares with upstream neighbors and within the country itself. Better internal coordination between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the MoWR could also enhance Iraq’s negotiating position in international conferences and boost water security as a national priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the downstream part of a downstream country, southern Iraq is a manifestation of catastrophic change. Water scarcity and environmental degradation are already leading to increased violence and tension both within farming communities and between newly displaced families and urban populations. Taking steps to tackle this overwhelming problem is a must, but the reasons for Basra’s water insecurity are complex and intertwined with both Iraq’s ancient and recent history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over millennia, the people of southern Iraq adapted to water abundance. More than just surviving, communities prospered by learning to work around the floods every spring. The environmental benefits of these waters, particularly in the marshlands, made the region habitable. The waters moderated extreme summer heat, preserved the biodiversity that communities depended on, and provided livelihoods, food, and transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, that former abundance has become a curse. Generations of floods entrenched social, cultural, and economic behaviors in Iraq that are difficult to shake in this era of scarcity, and in the shadow of near-constant war and sanctions. Renewed urgency has led to greater advocacy on the international stage and the completion of some long-delayed infrastructure projects. But to avoid further instability, Iraq—a country that has suffered from years of violence and sanctions—will need to finally prioritize water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regionally, the government will need to strengthen its economic and diplomatic position to better negotiate for transboundary waters. However, Iraq must also prepare for such diplomacy to not bear fruit. Political promises and water-sharing agreements among riparian countries have been falling apart. Turkey now regularly slashes its allocations of the Euphrates River to Syria—per a 1987 agreement—by half, and this affects Iraq further downstream. In a warming world, states’ water-sharing parsimony is likely to worsen. Moreover, there is little a city like Basra can do about transboundary partners or even other upstream users within the country, as the primary responsibility for negotiating water shares with other governorates and transboundary countries lies with the MoWR and the central government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A systemic shift in Iraq’s domestic water management is a must. The Ministry of Agriculture can promote modern irrigation technologies, regulate water-intensive crop cultivation, and introduce alternative crops for local consumption or export. These steps will gradually contribute to sustainable water management and agricultural practices in Iraq. Water management reforms could also improve Iraq’s negotiating posture with transboundary neighbors and with international donors and lenders. However, shifting agriculture away from water-intensive crops and irrigation methods will require the central government’s commitment to reorient the economy and tackle powerful vested interests and corruption. Without the ability to truly enforce regulations on water use, crops, and trade, the Iraqi government will struggle to see immediate benefits from such reforms. Worse, inconsistently enforcing these regulations could lead to increased societal tensions. In the near term, Iraq will need to find a path for reform that allows the government to circumvent or co-opt vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving municipal waters and services is a good place to start. With water issues in southern Iraq reaching crisis levels in recent years, politicians have an interest in investing in water security for their political survival. It is vitally important for the government to provide basic services, such as water and electricity, at affordable prices. It is a major task, but one that is politically feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of Basra illustrates how instability and threats to political power—in the form of water protests in 2018—can compel both central and local governments to address water issues. Investing in renewed distribution systems, as well as water and wastewater treatment plants, will mitigate future health crises. By developing a new drinking water transmission system, the government will also be able to provide affordable potable water to its citizens while collecting revenue. Handing over project implementation to local authorities, with significant monitoring by loan providers, could also hasten more responsible project implementation. Constituents will be able to see the immediate benefits, making such reforms beneficial for politicians focused on their survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future may look different than the past, but it will be more sustainable for Iraqis, as it will curb instability and violence. Addressing the water crisis will also help the government rebuild trust with communities that have already endured too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-political-economy-of-water-insecurity-in-jordan&quot;&gt;The Political Economy of Water Insecurity in Jordan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;neda-zawahri&quot;&gt;Neda Zawahri&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TJIhFLW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan is in an unenviable position when it comes to water. It is a naturally arid country, downstream from unreliable transboundary neighbors. On top of these natural and geographic obstacles, it has struggled to tackle water management within its borders because of a number of regional and domestic political challenges. Despite the obstacles, Jordan will need to overcome its water insecurity to remain a viable state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan’s water scarcity has threatened the state’s security for decades. Due in part to a growing population and an increase in irrigated agriculture between 1950 and 1990, the government has been operating on a significant domestic water deficit since the 1990s. Current domestic water demand is 1.1 billion m3 per year, whereas the country’s available renewable water resources are just 977 mcm per year. Climate change, natural population growth, influxes of refugees, and the mismanagement of existing water resources threaten to exacerbate the water crisis. For now, Jordan covers the deficit of 151 mcm per year by buying additional water from Israel, mining near-depleted aquifers, and rationing water, but all of these strategies are precarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan overextracts from and, effectively, mines 10 of its 12 groundwater aquifers, by double the safe yields of some. This has contributed to a deterioration in water quality and increased salination. The Azraq and Amman-Zarqa aquifers, for example, are declining by one meter per year because of overextraction, which has increased the water’s salinity and nitrate concentration, making it unusable and even toxic in some areas. Parts of northern Jordan now receive piped household water just once a month, while the residents in the capital receive water once a week. This strategy for surviving water deficits is unsustainable and unreliable for meeting its present and future needs. Jordan’s ability to buy water from Israel has also been put under significant political strain in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing the population with access to safe and sufficient water will be integral to Jordan’s political stability and social and economic development, but the country faces numerous political, economic, and demographic challenges to achieving water security. The often-competing interests of domestic and international stakeholders, the political unreliability of multilateral water projects, and Jordan’s vulnerability to upstream consumption of transboundary rivers have all compromised the country’s efforts to secure a sustainable supply of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To confront this challenge, the Jordanian government needs to prioritize water security domestically. The country must reduce internal water demand and augment its internal water supplies to make itself more resilient to climate change and geopolitical shocks. Its allies—the United States, Germany, and France, who invest heavily in Jordan’s stability and viability as a state—should also support such a path to achieving water security within its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate this argument, this chapter will first provide background on Jordan’s natural limitations and the regional challenges it faces in securing water. It will lay out how and why Jordan’s persistent efforts toward transboundary cooperation have often fallen short, leaving it less resilient and in a constant state of crisis management. The chapter will then assess Jordan’s domestic water management challenges, analyzing the diverging interests of government institutions, local stakeholders, and the international donors upon whom Jordan heavily depends. It will then analyze why decades of prioritizing stability over sustainability have delayed necessary domestic reforms and brought the nation to multiple points of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of the chapter suggests how the Jordanian government could follow through with long-delayed reforms with a more transparent process that provides ample carrots before sticks. And finally, while Jordan should continue to pursue multilateral efforts that can augment its water supply and build regional peace, the challenges of these efforts indicate that doing so within the country’s own boundaries may be the key to increasing its resilience to seemingly inevitable regional shocks. In building internal water resiliency, Jordan would be following the path of other regional states like Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-inhospitable-nature-and-neighborhood&quot;&gt;Background: Inhospitable Nature and Neighborhood&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By some measures, Jordan is the second-most water-scarce country in the world. Over 80 percent of its land is an arid desert—badia in Arabic—receiving less than 200 mm of rainfall per year. In 2021, it had about 61 m3 of renewable water available per capita per year, well below the 500 m3 per capita per year threshold marking absolute water scarcity for countries. Due to climate change, the Jordanian Ministry of Water and Irrigation, along with independent studies, anticipate that the country’s available freshwater will decline 15 percent further by 2040 and 50 percent further by century’s end, causing knock-on effects for food security and the economy. According to the World Bank, the reduction of water supply and climate change’s impacts on agriculture will cause a 6.8 percent decline in Jordan’s GDP by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional politics also affect Jordan’s water security in numerous ways. While Jordan is not itself embroiled in conflict, it has hosted multiple waves of refugees from conflict-affected neighboring countries. In addition to Palestinian refugees who fled or were forced from their homes in what is today Israel and the West Bank in 1948 and 1967, Jordan has absorbed hundreds of thousands of Iraqi and Syrian refugees in the past two decades. In fact, 13 percent of Jordan’s population are now Syrian refugees, and more than half of all Jordanians claim Palestinian descent. The influx of refugees has placed even more pressure on the country’s limited water supplies and its wastewater treatment facilities. Syrian refugees in northern Jordan, for example, have increased the region’s water demand by 40 percent. These influxes highlight the importance of Jordan’s ability to develop a reliable water supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shocking as these population surges have been to Jordan’s water budget, perhaps few other issues affect the country’s water security like its transboundary relations with Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. Jordan is a downstream riparian country that sits along the transboundary Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers and the Disi aquifer, which together provide 25 percent of the country’s domestic water supply. However, this supply has become unreliable because of increased upstream consumption and regional tensions. Even when Jordan has negotiated bilateral treaties governing these transboundary water supplies, its military weakness relative to neighboring riparian countries and the general instability within the region have made it difficult to secure a fair share in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan’s northern neighbor presents an example of this challenge. The influx of a million Syrian refugees since 2011 has been one factor challenging Jordan’s water security, but even prior to the fall of Syria’s Assad regime in December 2024, Jordan has long struggled to obtain an adequate share of the Yarmouk River, which flows from Syria. Between 1953 and 2001, Syria and Jordan signed multiple bilateral agreements to share the Yarmouk and allow Jordan to construct the Wahda, or “Unity,” Dam. However, contrary to the spirit of its name, the transboundary relations between the Assad family and the Hashemite rulers of Jordan surrounding the dam were disappointing. With each consecutive treaty, the dam’s size has decreased, and Syria has secured its right to fill more of its own upstream dams prior to allowing the Wahda to fill. Due to this upstream consumption, the Wahda has never reached its full capacity of 110 mcm since it became operational in 2006. In 2013, as Syria’s stability was breaking down, the dam’s water reached 68 mcm for the first time. In 2018, the dam reached its highest capacity, at 88 mcm; but in 2022, as Assad’s regime increased its authority over the country, the water fell to just 28 mcm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after the fall of the Assad regime, Israel invaded southwestern Syria and took control of both the Yarmouk River and the Wahda dam within Syrian territory. The lack of political stability in Syria and Israeli control of this water supply could affect Jordan’s water security. While the Wahda dam only provides around 10 percent of the country’s water needs in good years, these events point to the precariousness of Jordan’s transboundary situation. It is also a significant water and fishing source for southern Syria. At the time of writing, it is unclear what Israel’s long-term strategy is in terms of controlling this hydro-strategic territory and what impact this could have downstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, the fall of Assad is an opportunity for Jordan to amend its transboundary water-sharing agreement with its northern neighbor. The outdated agreement, which lacks details and effective enforcement mechanisms, is in dire need of an update. Given the new Syrian transitional government’s overt desire to have good relations with its neighbors, Jordan could take the opportunity to improve the distribution of basic services across boundaries—including water and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the southeast, relations are slightly more equitable with Jordan’s neighbor, Saudi Arabia, but still precarious. The Disi aquifer, which contains non-renewable, 30,000-year-old fossil water, traverses Jordan’s southeastern border. Since the 1980s, Saudi Arabia has extracted an unknown quantity of this groundwater to support agriculture. In Jordan, about 80 mcm per year is used for farming in the region around the Disi and for municipal water supply to nearby cities like Aqaba. But in 2013, desperate to provide water to its major cities in the northwest, where 94 percent of its population is concentrated, Jordan began transporting 100 mcm per year of Disi water 325 km north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Jordan and Saudi Arabia signed a treaty to govern their shared aquifer, agreeing to use the water in a protected area of the aquifer only for domestic uses. But the lack of quantitative allocation between the two states may lead to unsustainable depletion of the aquifer, complicating the treaty’s attempt at transparent cooperation and coordination. Many in Jordan, seeing the green farms over the border, believe that Saudi Arabia is still using the aquifer for agriculture. Remote-sensing analysis estimates that Saudi Arabia extracts 984 mcm per year from the aquifer in the city of Tabuk, near the border with Jordan, resulting in a precipitous decline of the water table within both states. Even in a best-case scenario, analysts estimate that the aquifer will be exhausted in 50 to 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if transboundary agreements could not be trickier, Jordan’s relations with its western neighbor, Israel, have become increasingly contentious. With more than half of Jordanians having ancestry from Palestine and much of the population sympathetic to the Palestinian plight, the Jordanian government has had to tread carefully in negotiations with Israel. To ease these tensions, the United States has expended enormous economic and political capital to promote cooperative transboundary water management of the Jordan River since the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was not until 1994 that Israel and Jordan signed an official peace treaty, normalizing relations and laying out guidelines for water cooperation. Annex II of the treaty allocates shares of the Yarmouk River’s water and commits to the construction of joint water projects between the states. However, aspects of the treaty disadvantaged Jordan or were never carried out, and so Jordan was expected to gain much more water than it actually has. For example, according to the treaty, the signatory states share the Yarmouk River with Israel, which diverts a fixed allocation of the waters from the river before it reaches Jordan. Using a fixed allocation effectively secured a predictable water supply for Israel but left Jordan’s share vulnerable to droughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To secure some of Jordan’s share of water from the lower Jordan River, the treaty called for the construction of storage facilities to capture flood waters. But after years of negotiations, the storage facilities to capture 20 mcm of flood water were never constructed. As a result, Jordan effectively lost its share of the lower Jordan River. Israel diverts 97 percent of the upper Jordan River through its 1964 National Water Carrier, after which the river connects to the Yarmouk to form the lower Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treaty also called for the construction of a desalination plant. But due to ambiguities in the agreement over the source of water to be desalinated and the source of funding for the project, the desalination plant—meant to give Jordan 50 mcm per year of water—was never constructed, which resulted in Jordan losing 25 mcm per year of high-quality water. Instead, Israel committed to allocate 25 mcm per year to Jordan from Lake Tiberias, where the water quality is much worse. The combination of ambiguities brought about by a rushed treaty and the failure to implement treaty provisions has meant that Jordanian negotiators and the Jordanian public believe they have received far less than promised. This perception has only deepened as Jordan’s water deficit has increased due to population growth and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help meet it domestic deficits, Jordan periodically purchases additional water from Israel outside of the parameters of the 1994 peace treaty. But Jordan’s ability to purchase water from Israel has increasingly become hostage to bilateral relations between the states. Relations deteriorated so significantly in 2021—a time when Jordan was particularly water-stressed—that U.S. president Joe Biden had to intervene to persuade Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to sell 3 mcm to Jordan. When Naftali Bennett became Israel’s prime minister in the summer of 2021, he approved the sale of 50 mcm of water, but this agreement expired in May 2024, once again putting Jordan’s water in jeopardy. Media reports indicated that Israel would withhold the water until Jordan restrained its criticism of the war in Gaza and allowed for the exchange of ambassadors. However, in April, after Jordan assisted in shooting down Iranian drones headed to Israel, Netanyahu agreed to a six-month extension of the 50 mcm sale of water as a reward for Jordan’s assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strained bilateral relations have periodically challenged Jordan’s ability not only to purchase additional water from Israel but also to build multilateral projects, such as the Red Sea–Dead Sea Conveyance (RSDSC) system and the energy-for-water exchange known as Project Prosperity, both of which could augment domestic water supplies for Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, Jordan and Israel approached the World Bank for help with constructing the RSDSC. The project was to provide Jordan and southern Israel with desalinated water, save the declining Dead Sea by discharging brine via a desalination plant in Aqaba, and encourage peace between the signatory states. A 2013 agreement stipulated that 200 mcm per year would be extracted from the Red Sea, for the production of 80–100 mcm per year of potable water. But in 2021, Jordan nixed the highly touted joint venture due to Israel’s decreased interest in the project, pressures from environmentalists, and increasing bilateral tensions between Prime Minister Netanyahu and King Abdullah of Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of fruitless negotiations over the RSDSC, that agreement was not the last proposition for transboundary water projects. In 2022, Israel, Jordan, and the UAE signed a memorandum of understanding to undertake an energy-for-water exchange whereby Jordan would build a solar power facility and sell 600 megawatts (MW) of its generated electricity to Israel. In return, Israel would build a desalination plant to sell 200 mcm per year of water to Jordan. The UAE committed to providing funding and technology for the solar power plant through its government-owned company, Masdar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was widely unpopular with the Jordanian public because it left out Palestinians and made Jordan’s water security even more dependent on Israel. While the deal would cover 20 percent of Jordan’s water budget, it would cover only 2 percent of electricity consumption for Israel, a country already rich in natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project seemed set to move ahead. But in November 2023, Jordan refused to proceed with it due to deteriorating bilateral relations over what Jordan’s leadership and population felt was a disproportionate Israeli military offensive in Gaza in response to Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what will happen to the deal in the long run. But what has become evident is that these transboundary projects, whether with Israel or Syria, are highly vulnerable to regional and bilateral politics, climate change, and the upstream consumption of water. While Jordan expected to gain a total of 310 mcm per year from the aforementioned transboundary water agreements, the country ended up receiving only 120 mcm per year, including Jordan’s purchase of 50 mcm per year of water from Israel. As such, the Jordanian government has doubled down on investing in a National Conveyance project, which involves the construction of a solar-operated desalination plant to generate 300 mcm per year of water from the Red Sea port of Aqaba, then transport the water via an energy-intensive 450 km pipeline to population centers located at higher elevations in the north. The project would help Jordan meet its water needs and minimize the impact of regional tensions on its plans for water security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While policymakers and peacemakers should remain hopeful for better days in the future, these examples demonstrate that water cooperation can fall prey to bilateral relations and regional politics. For a country as water-insecure as Jordan, entrenching such vulnerability could push the situation over the edge during another crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jordans-domestic-challenges&quot;&gt;Jordan’s Domestic Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding the effects of these exogenous forces are numerous domestic challenges to improving water management. The diverging interests of government institutions, local stakeholders, and international donors have often slowed, weakened, or halted necessary reforms and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A WEAK WATER SECTOR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While governance of water is highly centralized in Jordan, many of the institutions responsible for improving water security are not empowered to affect change. Jordan’s hiring practices also tend not to incentivize high performance or innovation among public sector workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to absorb new entrants to the workforce, the government often doles out public sector jobs, especially to those with influential tribal family connections. This makes it difficult to hire competent staff with relevant skills or to lay off unproductive civil servants. Moreover, due to meager pay in the public sector, government institutions—including the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI)—tend to lose those with technical skills to the very donors and private sector actors that they work with. While the MWI has a corps of competent engineers, decisionmaking and innovation is not common beyond this cohort of engineers. Rather, the ministry is bloated and overstaffed with unqualified and unmotivated employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this broader issue with the public sector, there are institutional challenges unique to the water sector. Jordan has many different institutions responsible for various aspects of water use, each with separate goals and mandates. As a result, as with the Ministry of Water Resources in Iraq, the MWI lacks the authority to systemically tackle water insecurity. For example, only the Jordanian cabinet can change the price of municipal or agricultural water, not the MWI. Consequently, the minister in charge of MWI depends on a group of political elites who have little interest in changing the status quo, even to make decisions that directly affect the country’s financial capacity and economic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Environment, and the MWI, domestic water resources are also governed by two autonomous bodies, the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) and the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA). The JVA is responsible for water management in the agriculturally important Jordan Valley, while WAJ is responsible for municipal and industrial water supply and wastewater treatment. The MWI develops the national water strategy, but it depends on all the aforementioned institutions for implementation. The MWI itself does not have the power or resources to implement its own strategy. When competing interests from agencies such as the Ministries of Agriculture and Interior—which are not incentivized to curb overpumping of water—fail to implement parts of the strategy, there is little the MWI can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the MWI is in a difficult position, the reality is that in all of these institutions, bureaucrats are more focused on political stability than on efficiency, economic recovery, or conservation. This mindset affects their ability to rein in elite farmers’ unsustainable water consumption in the water-poor highlands, the Jordan Valley, and in the southern desert. Raising the price of irrigation water would upset the monarchy’s powerful tribal base. Regulating water consumption has proven equally difficult. In the words of one water expert in 2023, “People would go crazy if you cut off their water here. You can’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing the interests of different institutions and constituencies makes it difficult for local authorities to curb not only overconsumption driven by ongoing water subsidies but also leakage and outright theft. Jordan loses 50 percent of its produced water—so-called non-revenue water—due to leaks, thefts, and inaccurate metering. Experts estimate that this could amount to 100–150 mcm per year. USAID estimates that the Jordanian government loses $500 million annually from non-revenue water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the institutions governing the country’s water supply lack the political power to enforce sensitive policies, curbing water theft has become especially challenging. Individuals seeking to resell stolen water face fines of 5,000 Jordanian dinars and jail terms of up to three years. But prosecution typically does not extend to those with powerful connections. Even when punishment is enforced, it does not appear to deter repeat offenders, as reselling stolen water to the municipal and agricultural sectors is very lucrative. In this environment, water thieves have become organized mafias. They attack the pipelines and disrupt a neighborhood’s water supply. After stealing the water, they resell it to the neighborhood at inflated prices via water tankers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, despite several government campaigns to snuff out water theft, it is still ubiquitous. In 2022, Jordanian government officials identified 10,000 cases of water theft across the country and hundreds of illegal wells. That year, they estimated that about 10 mcm of water was lost to theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has had more success curbing water consumption indirectly. For example, in comparison with the rest of the region, Jordan is doing fairly well in wastewater treatment and reuse. Much of this success is due to the expansion of Jordan’s largest wastewater treatment plant, completed in 2015. The As-Samra wastewater treatment plant handles 65 percent of Jordan’s urban wastewater and runs almost entirely on hydropower and biogas. Getting farmers to agree to use treated wastewater was initially challenging. However, when the government simply began channeling the treated effluent from As-Samra to the King Abdullah Canal, upon which lower Jordan Valley cultivators depend, the farmers were effectively made to use the treated wastewater—mixed with surface and rainwater—to irrigate their crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there is room for improvement. The government incurs high energy costs to pump wastewater to As-Samra, and a significant share of the country’s wastewater remains untreated. To address these issues, experts note that the government needs to expand and decentralize wastewater treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most rural areas continue to lack access to wastewater treatment facilities, contributing to the deteriorating quality of Jordan’s already-scarce fresh water. In a country as water-stressed as Jordan, resolving these issues would not just be a boon to water quality but a necessity in confronting an even drier future. However, for many Jordanians, having a wastewater treatment facility near one’s home or land is still shunned. Farmers using treated wastewater, and those living near such facilities, fear that their crops or land will be devalued. To move forward, Jordan will need to educate these communities on the benefits of wastewater treatment and reuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-donors-a-mismatch-between-hopes-and-realities&quot;&gt;The Role of Donors: A Mismatch Between Hopes and Realities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the oil-rich Gulf States and Israel, which can use their financial resources to construct desalination and wastewater treatment plants to significantly augment domestic water supply, Jordan’s limited financial capacity makes it heavily reliant on the international donor community. It depends on external funding for the construction, operation, and maintenance of its hydrological infrastructure, as well as to cover the large budget deficits of its water institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International financial aid, consisting of both grants and loans to the water and agricultural sectors, represents a significant portion of Jordan’s already generous package of loans and assistance. In 2022, Jordan received $4.4 billion in aid, of which 14.4 percent went to the water and sanitation sector and 13.2 percent went to food security and agriculture. As such, Jordan must balance the interests of donors and its population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank, USAID, and others have all pressured Jordan to raise its water tariffs, cut subsidies, trim bloated bureaucracies, and cut non-revenue water. At times, donors have advised Jordan to undertake all these policy modifications simultaneously. However, when the Jordanian government hesitates or when protests are predicted, donors tend to pull back, leaving nothing resolved. In some cases, projects to bridge the gaps between donor and local stakeholder interests mean that projects become unsustainable or are never completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many examples of this clash between Jordan’s political realities and donors’ plans. One example is the effort of the German aid agency Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) to fund the creation of water user associations (WUAs) in 2001. The goal was to improve the efficiency of farmers’ water use in the Jordan Valley, manage operational and maintenance problems in the delivery of water, improve cost recovery of irrigation water for the Jordan Valley Authority, and develop a system of participatory management for irrigation water. The WUAs led to some positive outcomes. It allowed farmers to monitor water thefts and manipulation of water meters, as well as to carry out minor maintenance. But in the end, the WUAs simply became extensions of a powerful tribal network that used the associations to resist the enforcement of water conservation policies—including those to reduce theft and use treated wastewater in the northern Jordan Valley. The presidents of the WUAs—typically tribal leaders— often hired workers with connections, rather than technical skills, to monitor pipes and open taps. The WUAs also allowed smaller farmers to resist government policies as they rode on the coattails of powerful farmers’ lobbying through the associations. While that solidarity decreased theft between farmers, it may have enabled more theft from the Jordanian state’s water resources, like the King Abdullah Canal. The positive impact on Jordan’s water deficit and water management have remained minimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple studies of WUAs reveal that their effectiveness depends on understanding the socioeconomic, political, and cultural context in which they operate. In this case, donors failed to account for the divergent interests of stakeholders, which limited the WUAs’ effectiveness. Farmers saw membership in a WUA as a means of securing water and a path to patronage, while employees at the Jordan Valley Authority sought to protect their institutional power and feared the devolution of authority to a WUA. Had donors understood the sociopolitical context in the basin, then efforts by powerful tribes to capture resources could have been managed more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Highland Water Forum (HWF) provides another example of donors attempting to implement participatory water management without fully appreciating the sociopolitical context. The MWI, the French government, and GIZ established the forum in 2010 to enhance the efficiency of irrigation water use, reduce groundwater abstraction of the overexploited Azraq aquifer and wetland, and improve the participatory decision-making process. The project brought together 60 stakeholders—including farmers, government institutions, research centers, and NGOs—to develop ideas to protect the aquifer’s dwindling water. In 2013, an action plan was presented to the MWI’s minister, with policy recommendations that included revising bylaws and well regulations, establishing a rainwater harvesting program, and improving the collection and dissemination of data on irrigation water-use efficiency. But once GIZ funding ended, more financial support did not materialize. When the project ended with little follow-through on the recommendations, farmers who took part in the process, expecting financial gains and greater access to water, were dissatisfied. Without the sustained support to provide these benefits, MWI had no way of using the forum as a way of mediating its reforms—its priority with the project. And while donor governments saw the forum as a way of enforcing the 2002 groundwater abstraction law, they failed to support the elements of the program that may have won farmers’ support—or at least their acquiescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like so many initiatives, without sustainable financial support and with frequent changes in both the leadership of the MWI and the representatives of Jordan’s donors, the Highland Water Forum fizzled out. The next MWI strategic plan did not even mention it. In this case, even when there was good faith from farmers to participate in a process like the forum, there was no follow-up or understanding of incentives. This breaks trust on all sides: farmers become less inclined to participate in the next process, while donors and the MWI trust the farmers less. No one’s motivations were adequately responded to, and incentives were not built into the process to accompany requisite sticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with slight modifications and longer-term support, many projects could be more successful. For example, the agricultural component of one such project to connect private sector suppliers of water-conserving technologies to farms proved to be enormously cost-effective. The Water Innovations Technologies (WIT) project, active from 2017 to 2022, was successful for a time at improving water savings at relatively low cost. But without price mechanisms or crop selection policies to discourage excess water usage, farmers simply stopped using these technologies when they fell into disrepair. Rather than abandoning projects like this, donors and the government should lean into the lessons learned and continue to support the maintenance of the projects while gradually increasing prices, incentivizing less water-intensive crops, and regulating water usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-more-resilient-path-forward&quot;&gt;A More Resilient Path Forward&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COMMUNICATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enhance water security, the monarchy itself needs to take on a more proactive role in negotiating with powerful stakeholders to limit their water usage, minimize pollution of existing supplies, and increase water efficiency across the agricultural and municipal sectors. For many within Jordanian society and politics, the king has the final word. That means that he must empower civil servants to carry out policies and serve as a mediator when there is discontent. When powerful constituents protest, the king needs to support civil servants with their efforts to rein in overconsumption. To assuage discontent among powerful stakeholders, the king and high-ranking government officials can explain the threat of water insecurity to the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One time-tested tradition during moments of protest and popular discontent has been for the king himself to visit powerful stakeholders, such as tribal leaders, and listen to their grievances. Direct meetings and negotiations between high-level government officials and various stakeholders, such as farmers and political elites, can help minimize these actors’ resistance to large structural changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donors and the government could also distribute free water conservation equipment along with the promise to provide maintenance—in return for being able to enforce water and crop regulations. Paired with a major public relations and education campaign about the need to conserve water and the benefits of the technology provided, this could simultaneously shift public attitudes and provide the needed sticks and incentives to water users. An educational campaign on planting vegetable and fruit varieties that are less water intensive and more drought resistant, followed by the provision of free seeds to farmers, could increase the probability of compliance. Farmers also need financial and educational support to see them through the transition. Farmers stealing water or continuing to grow water-intensive crops should be subject to significant punishment to effectively change behavior. Some may say this is expensive, but many water experts have stated it would likely cost less than the numerous failed projects already undertaken. It is also increasingly existential for Jordan to prioritize such spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gradual approach would include a prolonged national education and public relations campaign equating water security with national security and socio-economic justice. Greater transparency and information-sharing will be key, but given the deep mistrust of the government by the public, those water governing institutions cannot do it alone. They will need to enlist civil society, religious institutions, private sector actors, and trusted community members to lead the way. What they have going for them is that every Jordanian knows the country is water scarce. But providing specific information on how individuals can improve water security is essential—as is ensuring that everyone is held to the same standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dissemination of information to the public through various means (e.g., TV, radio, social media, religious institutions, and schools) could lay the groundwork for the harder policies ahead, such as increases in water tariffs and decreases in import tariffs on water-intensive goods. In 2023, Jordan used this strategy to spread awareness about upcoming municipal water subsidy cuts for all households consuming above a fixed quantity. After a prolonged information campaign and transparent public discussions on the price increases, the government implemented a policy in January 2024 to gradually increase water prices and to shift from quarterly to monthly payments to minimize the impact on water bills. To increase transparency and prepare society for new water utility bills, the government even released a water bill calculator on their website to allow people to anticipate their bills. There was still some domestic discontent with the new policy, but the gradual and transparent approach proved effective at minimizing the mass protests that typically accompany many of Jordan’s domestic policy changes. As such, policymakers should think about applying a similar strategy to the agricultural sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With backing from the king, government representatives can carry out a public campaign to educate society about the nation’s water crisis and the need to conserve water for current and future generations. Such a campaign would influence the population to make native plants and water conservation more of a priority. This approach could gradually reduce pressure on the government—an actor often seen as merely taking away benefits—and recast it as a leader in the fight to secure the nation for future generations. Such public campaigns would then make it easier to regulate the water consumption of wealthier segments of Jordan’s population, who are often less efficient. For all of these reforms, a gradual approach with continuous follow-through to fine-tune existing projects would allow the government and donors to chip away at Jordan’s water woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EXPANDING WATER TREATMENT AND REUSE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan will also need to expand its reuse of treated graywater and wastewater. Currently, farmers can switch to a mixture of graywater (water used in household cleaning, baths, and washing machines), treated wastewater, and surface water from the King Abdullah Dam and Zarqa River for many crops. Households have the option to use graywater in their gardens. The government, in turn, can be more transparent about the quality of water in the reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also remains plenty of room for improvement in expanding wastewater treatment facilities in rural areas. In 2023, the country had 33 wastewater treatment plants that produced 186 mcm per year of treated effluent. About 90 percent of treated wastewater is reused in either the agricultural or industrial sectors, which represents a huge improvement. But some 30 percent of the urban population and 80 percent of the rural population are still unconnected to the wastewater network. Expanding access in these remaining areas could be a major boost for the conservation and preservation of domestic fresh water supplies. Promoting the reuse of graywater would also have significant benefits. In rural areas that lack wastewater treatment plants, the government encourages households to voluntarily recycle graywater for irrigation and toilet flushing purposes. As a result, it is estimated that 54 mcm per year of graywater is reused in Jordan. Such programs can be expanded to the rest of the country with little political blowback, if any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsidizing high-quality water conservation technologies—like drip irrigation—and less water-intensive crops in the near term will vastly improve water savings. It may also minimize political consequences for governmental crackdowns on excessive usage or theft. Convincing the remaining elite farmers who grow water-intensive citrus, or other crops for regional markets, to partially use treated wastewater will also be important. Currently, these farmers fear that treated wastewater will harm their fruit trees and curb their export potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By focusing on improving the quality of treated wastewater, testing the water as it travels through various points, and sharing test results with farmers, the government can help to overcome some of these perceptions. Even test crops could be used to show the benefits of using certain kinds of treated water or water-conserving equipment, such as drip irrigation and weather- and soil-monitoring systems. The co-founder of iPlant, a Jordan-based startup in the field of agricultural technology, has even said that treated graywater is more beneficial to plants grown in vertical farms than tap water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government and donors should also support studies assessing whether treated wastewater or graywater can stabilize aquifers. Underground aquifers are naturally resistant to increased evaporation as the climate changes, but if they collapse, that naturally sustainable water storage mechanism disappears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EXPANDING RELIABLE WATER SUPPLIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while it is important for Jordan to improve its domestic management of water, doing so will still be insufficient to meet the country’s domestic water needs. Closing the gap on all non-revenue water (estimated at around 100 mcm per year) would still leave a deficit of over 50 mcm per year today. This deficit is only going to increase due to factors like climate change, population growth, increased upstream consumption of shared water resources, and overextraction of aquifer water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan’s domestic water demand is expected to rise from 1,128 mcm per year in 2022 to 2,000 mcm per year in 2040. If Jordan is able to curb both water theft and overconsumption, the country can save an estimated 100–150 mcm per year, which is still not enough to close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, something must also be done to increase supply for the future. Given the vulnerability of multilateral efforts to regional and domestic politics, the construction of joint infrastructure or the purchasing of additional water from Israel may not help Jordan secure a reliable source of water in the current political environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, Jordan should follow the experience of Israel and the Persian Gulf states by building its own desalination capacity within its territory. To secure a sustainable supply of water, Jordan is proceeding with the National Water Conveyance. Even with the operation of the National Water Conveyance and other new multilateral projects, Jordan is unlikely to meet even its domestic water needs in the near term. In fact, with the operation of these new projects, Jordan is expected to face a 15 mcm per year deficit in its water needs by 2035. In light of growing frustration within Jordan toward Israel and the challenges of negotiating a multilateral project, international donors should support the NWC. After securing the desalination plant and improving its domestic water management, Jordan could then opt to join multilateral projects as a means for promoting peace in the turbulent region and helping to build the country’s resilience to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the NWC, Jordan must secure a financially acceptable deal. At the time of writing, the bid for the NWC was more than 50 percent over initial cost estimates and interest rates on the project were oppressively high. Financial acuity will be needed to ensure that the project does not bankrupt the country, causing a financial crisis even before the country reaches a water crisis. In addition to the high cost estimates, the deal requires more synergy with the National Electric Power Company. Electricity for the project would come to over 12 percent of Jordan’s total electricity use and increase the water sector’s electricity usage by 150 percent. Failing to better integrate the electricity and water sectors for this project could threaten the reliability of the grid. These issues are manageable but may require a reconsideration of the logistics of the project to ensure that Jordan does not dig itself out of water insecurity, only to be hit with other crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-3&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neoliberal economic theory advises the use of pricing mechanisms to encourage a resource’s efficient and sustainable use. However, cheap water is intimately connected to the political bargain that the Jordanian monarchy made with its citizens during the state-building process. In return for citizens’ loyalty, the government keeps resources like water cheap and public sector jobs available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systemic reforms that would improve the water deficit are, therefore, potentially threatening to Jordan’s stability. Jordan’s international benefactors, such as the United States and major European donor governments, know this well. So, while donors encourage the government to reduce water waste, they also have tended to prioritize political stability over environmental and financial sustainability, fearing the social and political impact of price increases or water shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, to avoid upsetting this delicate balance, international donors have worked with Jordan to increase its water supply. While Jordan’s government pushed to construct hydrological infrastructure—either multilateral, bilateral, or domestic—to augment supplies, it delayed domestic reforms. These delays entrenched the sociopolitical obstacles to water security through improved efficiency. The disappointing results of multilateral and transboundary water efforts have further pushed Jordan toward a precipice. But there are steps that can be taken that will begin to chip away at the challenge and put the country on more resilient ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan cannot alter its natural aridity and downstream location. Increasing its dependence on its riparian neighbors for additional water leaves it highly vulnerable. To address its existential water crisis, Jordan should focus on solutions within its control: reducing domestic demand for water and augmenting domestic supplies. The king and donor governments have the most power to shift Jordan’s grim trend toward deepening water insecurity; they can achieve this by following policies that offer a staggered series of carrots and sticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ccess to basic public goods, such as electricity and clean water, is an integral part of state stability and regime legitimacy. The combination of climate change, refugee influxes, and mismanagement is threatening Jordan’s ability to provide its population with a basic essential resource that is not only integral to regime stability but also to human security. By 2100, if Jordan does not undertake critical measures, over 90 percent of its low-income population will experience critical water insecurity. The poor in Jordan already struggle for clean water. Any further decrease in water availability and quality can raise the potential for instability in a relatively stable country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thousands of Jordanians protesting for days straight in 2024, calling on the government to cancel its agreements with Israel, and the fall of the Assad regime in Syria highlight the vulnerability inherent to dependence on Jordan’s unstable neighborhood for something as essential as water. To avert a crisis, Jordanians, their government, and their government’s allies must cooperate to expand supply and reduce demand for water within the borders of the country. And, as the region stabilizes, work on multilateral efforts to augment water supplies and build regional peace can resume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-4&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Middle East is no stranger to water scarcity and violence. For centuries, conflict has exacerbated water insecurity and vice versa. But the region is now at a tipping point. Groundwater aquifers are running dry or becoming contaminated, populations are exploding, and borders are more hardened than ever, making resettlement—a time-tested survival strategy—impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere are these issues more evident than in the Palestinian territories. In initial plans for this volume, these areas were meant to be among the case studies. But the events of 2023 and 2024 swept away any notion that CSIS could conduct a timely, forward-looking study of what was possible there. Even before the most recent conflict, conditions in the West Bank and Gaza exemplified the danger of applying an apolitical lens to a political problem. As is the case across much of the region, water security fell prey to the lack of political progress on resolving underlying conflicts. Without that political progress, donor governments and aid agencies have resorted to applying technical fixes to political problems. But in the Palestinian territories, as in much of the world, water insecurity has been a sign of deeper dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, Israel has restricted West Bank Palestinians’ freedom to cultivate land, rehabilitate infrastructure, or build wells and desalination plants, while simultaneously being very permissive of Israeli Jewish citizens—including settlers’—requests to do the same. As a result, around 180 Palestinian communities in rural areas of the occupied West Bank have no access to running water, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). In Gaza, even before the current hostilities, it was difficult for Palestinians and donors to build adequate desalination facilities to treat enough contaminated and brackish groundwater to rescue the endangered Coastal Aquifer, upon which the 2.3 million people living in Gaza depend for water. For political and security reasons, Israel has also wanted to develop Palestinians’ reliance on Israeli supplies of water and energy, which the Israeli government has sometimes interrupted. The recent conflict has laid bare this asymmetry. At the start of the conflict, the Israeli government immediately cut almost all of Gaza’s access to water, energy, and food. As the conflict in Gaza has raged for months, clean water has become scarce, and polio has reemerged after 25 years, when untreated sewage flowed into the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ciarán Ó Cuinn noted in the foreword to this volume, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a particularly egregious example of what happens when donors, mediators, and communities are unable to resolve political challenges to water security. Political issues constrain both sustainability and equity in all case studies evaluated in this volume, as well as all over the world. Governments decide how and where to spend money, and vested interests (e.g., polluting industries, warlords, and farmers) can play an outsized role as well. Even in the United States, local tax revenues—and the associated political and financial power—often dictate where infrastructure will be rehabilitated or built. Flint, Michigan, is a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flint, a predominantly Black and poor community, will forever be synonymous in the United States with its water crisis. Local authorities dismissed concerns of high lead levels in the water in order to cut costs. But much like the Middle East, water insecurity was present both before and after Flint’s lead-laden water became headline news. Flint’s woes stemmed from historic marginalization, not local authorities’ inability to provide safe water for residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these difficulties in the world’s richest and most powerful democracy, it may seem quixotic to prioritize water security within the existing disorder of the Middle East. But despite the challenges, these case studies show that water can no longer be put on hold. Countries have been living beyond their means to avoid war and instability. But equating the absence of a direct water war with cooperation or peace has been dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local conflicts and human insecurity have increased, even as countries have not gone to war over water. For weaker parties, war has not been an option. Rather than immediately resort to violence, those most affected by water insecurity—the poor, the marginalized, and weaker states—have simply tried to cope. They have used less water as governments have begun withholding or rationing water for certain communities. As water and sanitation services have deteriorated, people have resorted to buying expensive bottled water and relying on water trucking if they can afford to. Those who cannot afford bottled water have gotten sick. Farmers lucky enough to be able to drill deeper for water have done so. Those that cannot have moved, when possible. They have sold their possessions, married off their daughters earlier than planned, and sent their sons and husbands to work in cities, where they have often been seen by urban populations as an added burden on already limited services. Weaker downstream riparians have tried to cope rather than fight, but regional tensions and violence have increased as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, these coping mechanisms are reaching a breaking point throughout the Middle East, with some communities forced to accept emergency rations of water and falling victim to previously eradicated waterborne diseases like cholera and polio. A third of the countries in the Middle East are embroiled in active conflicts, and many others are hosting refugees or are affected in some way by neighboring conflicts. Not only is there no end in sight to these crises, but they seem to be getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unemployment rates remain high; water is running out; the energy transition is coming, as are other great powers and regional powers, who will have their own agendas. In Jordan, youth unemployment reached as high as 50 percent in 2020. More and more Jordanians are finding illegal pathways out of the country. At the same time, every country in the Middle East and North Africa will experience extreme water stress by 2050, meaning that all will be using at least 80 percent of their available water supplies. If oil prices fall, producers like Iraq will be far less able to absorb the unemployed into the public sector or provide basic services. At the same time, global competition will allow countries to play great powers off one another, lessening the pressure from any one donor government to reform governance. Dealing with the seismic social and economic shifts of the next decade will require thoughtful planning, but the region is currently mired in crisis management, with international interest diminishing and aid budgets plummeting. And even with generous aid, problems like conflict, financial troubles, and water insecurity persist. Across the region—especially in Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, and Palestine—the United States and other international donors have spent tens of billions of dollars on water security. It is time to reconsider how these funds are spent, not cut them off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve better outcomes, the politics that have brought the region to this inflection point cannot be ignored. For decades, Western governments, as donors and political stakeholders in the Middle East, have prioritized short-term stability over long-term sustainability and human security. Across the region, governments have feared systemic reforms would tip a delicate political balance out of their favor. Western governments have shared their concern. As a result, many reforms and regulations have either never been implemented or were weakened. Due to the political challenges of reform, governments and donors have focused on building dams, exploiting groundwater, and building desalination plants. Few of the countries covered in this volume have adequately pursued wastewater treatment and reuse, targeted water theft and leakage, enforced more moderate water usage, or negotiated fair and sustainable water-sharing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors in this volume do not shy away from the political challenges to water security. Rather, they acknowledge the many hurdles and the motivations of various stakeholders, thereby outlining feasible steps toward more sustainable and equitable water management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria and Yemen are perhaps the most challenging cases. Embroiled in conflict for years, both societies struggle to invest in long-term solutions to their increasingly existential water insecurities. Donor governments and private investors are reluctant to support possible solutions, and sometimes are even legally constrained from doing so. Nonetheless, authors Mauvais and Al-Saidi both argue that there are small steps that the international community can and must take to set both areas on a more sustainable path. Building local capacity and monitoring capabilities would allow communities to measure the extent of their water problems and advocate for solutions with authorities and donors. Connecting local experts and civil society to the wider world could also make local authorities and vested interests more accountable and build awareness of concrete solutions. In the cases of Sana’a and northeastern Syria, these solutions include diversifying and incentivizing drought-resistant crops and ensuring that water is part of peace negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these cases, international actors can also play a diplomatic role. In northeastern Syria, they can encourage Turkey to release more water and cease the destruction of vital infrastructure. In Yemen, they can encourage warring parties and diplomats to incorporate water management into negotiations, including incentives for rehabilitating and building water-related infrastructure and concessions on access, human rights, and security. Both authors argue that such steps will be vital for national and global security as these areas grow unable to absorb the unemployed or provide food and water for their people. Destabilizing internal and outward migration will be inevitable without these measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Basra, the obstacles to reforming the agricultural sector are so wide-ranging that the authors have focused on one aspect of water insecurity that is reasonably surmountable: the provision of safe drinking water and preparation for further urbanization. Those steps will not solve all of Basra’s problems, but they are necessary and feasible in the current environment. However, the authors also outline reasonable steps that may encourage greater cooperation in agricultural and transboundary management—the greatest potential sources of water security in the country. Recommendations include linking water to other areas of concern for transboundary neighbors, like trade and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding Jordan, author Zawahri argues that the government should work with civil society and local leaders to frame stewardship of water resources as a patriotic and social justice issue. Part of this effort will be enacting reforms in a transparent and universally accountable way, while providing ample investments and sufficient time to ease the transition. At the regional level, Zawahri acknowledges the need for water-stressed Jordan to develop its own water resources to overcome the long-standing political challenges to transboundary, multilateral water deals. Indeed, the data shows that Jordan will need to pursue multilateral efforts, domestic desalination capacity, and greater domestic water-use efficiency just to meet the needs of its growing population by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with these more limited politically feasible steps to achieving water security, conflict, broadly defined, may be necessary. Contestation—defined as the divergence of goals, objectives, expectations, methods, and behavior—does not have to amount to violence or coercive cooperation. It is the way such conflicts are approached that will define the future of water security in the region and the potential for violence. Avoiding the political realities of extreme water insecurity is leading to more crises, which could cause further instability in the future. Eminent scientists and academics briefing the UN General Assembly have already noted that disputes over shared water resources will rise due to changes brought on by climate change and growing human demands for water. In all of these areas, employment in security services or armed groups is fast becoming one of the most important and last remaining livelihoods opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the bleak predictions, this volume contends that while disagreements are inherent to the quest for equitable and sustainable water management, violence is not inevitable—provided stakeholders, including regional governments, non-state governing actors, and donor governments, take decisive action. In some cases, that action will require more financial investment. More often than not, however, it will require different strategies. The current investments of time and resources should be shifted toward endeavors in which donors, governments, and lenders consider stakeholders’ incentives and follow the projects through, ensuring that some stakeholders do not become spoilers. For example, donors and governments should work toward building civic consensus around the need for wastewater treatment plants, emphasizing the upsides and debunking negative assumptions. Governments should not simply cut farmers off from using water or cultivating all of their land; they should assist farmers in transitioning to less water-intensive crops and farming methods. At the transboundary level, more diplomatic investment is needed to open paths for solutions that are not politically feasible today. In other words, donor governments with influence over upstream countries should encourage them to prioritize equitable water sharing. Downstream countries should manage domestic water sources more carefully, but they should also strengthen their diplomatic, economic, and security cooperation with neighbors to ensure that they are diversifying their leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice is stark. Either change course or face far greater challenges in the future. The Arab Spring and the subsequent conflicts have shown that the status quo is untenable. Those movements shook the region. As the aftershocks have continued, mistrust has increased between communities and countries, all while investment interest has decreased—yet both trust and investment will be crucial to achieving water security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, time is of the essence. Rather than sidestepping the political challenges, this volume has aimed to provide concrete steps to incentivize change among actors currently benefiting from an unsustainable status quo. To do so, countries must enlist reform-minded government officials, donors and international stakeholders, warring parties, civil society, farmers, and aid agencies. Each player must play a part in leveling the field. If they do not, inequity will widen, a growing swath of territory will become unlivable, and conflict—violent conflict—will break out and spill across borders. By implementing the solutions outlined here, countries can avert a looming crisis and pave the way for a more stable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With near-peer threats and stiff economic challenges, 2025’s Strategic Defence Review has hard balance to find if it is going to provide a credible Land force, but such a balance has been struck before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Army needs depth to be sustainable in war: both a second echelon to follow close behind the first, and structures to generate a third and subsequent ones. The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) and the Treasury, despite the recent increased announcement in spending, are unlikely to both fund more regular troops for a second echelon and maintain the equipment programme and extra munitions required for modernisation. Army Reserve units and formations can provide the cost-effective additional mass to expand the army in war and deliver that second echelon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Reserve can provide individual reinforcements but cannot grow the army with additional units. The current Future Soldier warfighting structure inhibits the ability of the Army Reserve to expand the British Army in war. This commentary looks to the last time a Defence Review had to balance “NATO First” with modernising the army in fiscally challenging times, set against a peer-level threat in Europe. It illustrates how the British Army embraced their reserve forces to reorganise and modernise into an army that was sustainable, affordable and played a key role in successfully delivering deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-current-demand-for-mass&quot;&gt;The Current Demand for “Mass”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been much mention of “mass” and the British Army, aligned to the SDR’s considerations. To be credible for high intensity warfighting experience from Ukraine suggests that the British Army will require access to more mass. Mass in these reports usually implies access to more numbers of people, more equipment and more munitions. However, the continuing financial pressures on UK Defence will likely prevent any significant increase to the numerical mass of full-time forces if it is to also provide the better firepower, enablement, readiness and resilience required. As a result, there has been more of an emphasis on the current force structure’s ability to successfully mass the effect of combat power through enhanced lethality delivered by modernisation, improved command and control, robotics and faster exploitation of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These enhancements are indeed important to win the first battle, especially for the UK’s medium sized army, but wars are rarely won by the first battle and peer-level opponents will return for a second round. It is important for an Army to retain enough people, equipment and munitions to deal with a wartime level of attrition and to continue to provide the range of capabilities to ensure it can at least take part in the second battle, and beyond. The Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Tony Radakin is correct that war in Europe is a remote chance but NATO’s land force sustainability is also important for keeping the odds low through deterrence. What balance of investments will deliver the optimum and sustainable British Army for its near-term readiness for warfighting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple force development terms sustainable depth is attained through the provision of additional capability, such as follow-on echelons. The structural basis of capability in the British Army, as in most other armies, is the unit and the formation. Most nations cannot afford to have standing armies made up of the required number of trained and equipped units ready to fight large wars. Peacetime armies are limited in size by national budgets and as Andrew Sharpe points out must be ready to expand rapidly to cope with the heavier demands of war. Threats and tasks increase greatly in war, formations suffer attrition, units need to be replaced, areas of operation grow larger. The medium-sized British Army must be ready at the outset to have a structure, a second echelon, which can generate more formations and more units for war, or it risks becoming very small, very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Army has traditionally relied on part-time Army Reserve units, who train collectively in peacetime, to generate the second echelon additional units for the expansion of the British Army in war. As has been pointed out many times before this remains the most cost effective and most successful way to expand the British Army for war. Additional units cannot simply be conjured up at the start of a war from pools of individual reinforcements, let alone untrained wartime volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The necessity for a funded, equipped and trained Army Reserve in peacetime has been a key lesson from Ukraine and from our own history. The peacetime formed reserve units of the Ukrainian Army were vastly more effective than those units pulled together from scratch with little cohesion and very poor combat effectiveness. While Army Reserve units are not equivalent in capability to Regular units, history, and our allies performance, show they can provide a “good enough” contingent capability within a few weeks from mobilisation, for the focussed wartime missions they should be allocated. This provides mass and sustainability, to allow time for subsequent echelons to be generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peacetime armies also need many individual reinforcements on wartime mobilisation. They are needed to fill inevitable peacetime gaps in both regular and reserve units and to bring all units up to a wartime strength, not needed in peace, to ensure units can cope with the rigours of war. Individual reinforcements are also needed to provide formations with a battle casualty replacement pool. The British Army has traditionally called back ex-Regulars (the Regular Reserve and those with liability for recall, now termed the Strategic Reserve) to provide most of these individual reinforcements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual reinforcements by themselves do not expand the Army, since they do not provide additional units, but are vital for making units and formations more resilient. Under current legislation you cannot “grow” the Strategic Reserve. They are fixed by virtue of being ex-regular so as a regular force shrinks so will the Strategic Reserve since their numbers are determined by regular leavers. Historically the Army have also developed plans to scour their peacetime-only structures to deliver more regulars in war for the deployable forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple-to-understand system, where the Army Reserve expanded the British Army in war with additional units on mobilisation and where the Regular Reserves were called back to provide resilience through individual gap filling, lasted for over 100 years. It was far from perfect, had its bumps, but was reasonably affordable in times of financial difficulty and was relatively successful when it came to fighting actual large-scale war and deterring a cold one. Unfortunately, this system has been slowly abandoned by the British Army over the last 30 years and the British Army will struggle to expand and deliver the mass it seems to have on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-un-expandable-future-soldier-british-army&quot;&gt;The Un-Expandable “Future Soldier” British Army&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been acknowledged that some part of the “Future Soldier” programme have not been ideal for the British Army. This is especially true for the Army Reserve. The Chief of Staff of Field Army wrote in 2023 that “Without the Army Reserve, any notion of maintaining the Army’s combat endurance beyond the first ‘thunderclap’ is fanciful”. Yet, the bulk of the fighting power of the Army Reserve is structurally tied up with that first “thunderclap”. Under Future Soldier, on mobilisation for war, the majority of Army Reserve units will provide up to 70% of the Army Reserve unit workforce to backfill the gaps in Regular Army units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Future Soldier backfill demand on the Army Reserve effectively removes the capacity of the British Army to rapidly expand on mobilisation and fundamentally undercuts the role of the Army Reserve to provide additional units for wartime. It also risks undermining the first echelon readiness, as Army Reserve personnel are at lower levels of readiness, and many could not deploy immediately with their combat formations without some additional training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional second echelon of the British Army, with up to 70 Army Reserve units on paper, is currently planned to be spent against the first echelon. The British Army has no depth. Meanwhile, the pool of individual Regular Reservists that traditionally provided a backfill function have been allowed to assume they will never be needed and despite repeated attempts, going back decades now, they have not yet been brought out of abeyance. I have previously written on why this has been culturally difficult for the British Army to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future Soldier, building on the slow withering of Army Reserve unit training since the end of the Cold War, has created a British Army for war that is primarily based on its full-time Regular Army structure in peace. The privileging of the units of the first echelon to the detriment of second echelon Army Reserve unit capability is explainable given financial pressures, is culturally understandable, has been influenced by political aversion to honest discussions about the Army, and has happened before. It makes the British Army in war a potentially “first battle” winning organisation, if the logistic problems of deploying can be overcome, but at the risk of being small and fragile for actual war winning. It has stripped out the capacity of the army to expand rapidly and to be more sustainable in war. Future Soldier has created the best possible single echelon force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any first rate second echelon will be a very long time arriving under Future Soldier. Yet the British Army has enough Army Reserve units now to create a second echelon; it has chosen to disinvest in their collective capability. The current Future Soldier structure also makes the British Army relatively more expensive for the units and resultant capability it can deliver in war in comparison to our NATO allies armies. Our NATO allies, including those who are also expeditionary, such as the Americans, still rely on cost effective expansion from reserve units and those like the French are investing heavily in building more reserve units. The fundamental withering of British Army Reserve capability has happened at a period when UK Defence is under pressure to deliver more wartime Land Forces for NATO and now also for UK Home Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there is now growing recognition that in order to sustain itself in a large-scale war the British Army’s “Reserve force will form our second echelon.” To do this it will need to use units from the Army Reserve and call upon individual reinforcements from its Regular Reserves. The SDR call for evidence indicated that Reserve capability is going to be an important factor in their thinking. They appear to have a desire to make more of the Army Reserve and the Regular Reserves. Without additional money this will involve tough choices and indications are that the Treasury will be hard pressed to provide much more for defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Army, various Defence Reviews have been in this space before – with regard to the poor and misunderstood state of reserves – and perhaps lessons can be drawn. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review and resultant Future Reserves 2020 programme show parallels, but were focused on developing operational reserve forces for lower intensity warfare. The review with some striking similarity to today’s British Army is perhaps the radical 1981 UK Defence Review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-1981-defence-review---nato-first-high-threat-but-little-extra-money&quot;&gt;The 1981 Defence Review - NATO First, High Threat but Little Extra Money&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early 1980’s saw a heightened peer-level threat from Eastern Europe leading to demands to improve the UK Land contribution to NATO. There was also an increased threat to the UK Homeland. This was set against severe financial constraints on growing UK Defence spending, but with Conservative party election pledges to increase the offer to Defence and make up for a decade of retrenchment and shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On attaining power in 1979, a generous pay offer from the new government had been given to Defence to try to improve retention in 1980 while still having to deal with severe in-year pressures to reduce costs and cancel expenditure from an over extended budget. A Defence review was called for to match ambition to the resources available. The review was to be focussed on a “NATO First” strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like today, the British Army was not in the best state. Some claimed the Army had the most outdated equipment in NATO. The Army had begun a process of modernisation of its key equipment, but with poor morale personnel recruitment was poor and outflow high. A previous review saw the warfighting corps adopt a structure that was not optimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Army also needed to become more sustainable for a more flexible NATO warfighting response. This would require increased stocks and increased mass. The British Army of 1981 did not have enough units on mobilisation to cover the requirements of a deployed and sustainable Corps for war in Europe. As the CGS of the time later remarked “There was not too bad a front line, but there was literally nothing to sustain it.” The Army needed more units in war, but an expansion of the regular forces was unlikely given the costs involved and that any extra funds would be needed for modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1981 Defence Review team made it clear they wished to prioritise commitments to Trident, NATO Land Forces and Home Defence. While there was actually an overall increase in the defence budget, the proportion for each of the services changed, reflecting a deliberate focus on the NATO alliance for UK security and the resulting political imperative to reinforce SACEUR’s needs. The Royal Navy aspect of the review has been covered in much detail over the years and the measures in light of the 1982 Falkland’s conflict, were effectively shelved a year later. The RAF budget was increased with their politically aligned focus on improving the Air Defence of the UK. The Army did uncharacteristically well and saw their overall budget estimates grow with some increased investment to continue to modernise the Army’s equipment and improve levels of stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deliver a more sustainable Army it had accepted the more radical change in the 1981 Defence Review that is often overlooked. The review was “determined to make more use of reserve forces” as an affordable way of delivering more capability for its NATO First policy. Improvements to Reserve Forces had been identified by the review team from early in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet NATO demands for more sustainable forces and in order to preserve funds for their modernisation programme the Army invested in its reserve forces. The Territorial Army in 1980 (the TA, whose name changed to the Army Reserve in 2014) was suffering somewhat from a recruitment and retention crisis and the Regular Reserve was known to be needed but somewhat languishing. They would need some investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment in additional reserve capacitywas controversial at the time in some quarters but it was seen to offer the best route to the political imperative of NATO First and delivering affordable sustainability. The 1981 Defence Review therefore saw a planned increase in the TA of 25% over ten years. This would grow it in personnel numbers from 45% of the size of the Regular Army to nearly 60% and so bring it more in line with NATO allies. Additional investment was also confirmed for the Regular Reserves with the introduction of the 1981 Individual Reinforcement Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To balance the books the Army reduced its full-time operating costs. It did this primarily through re-organisation and reducing associated personnel costs. The army had, as now, the largest proportion of its budget allocated to personnel costs across the single services, primarily to its full-time personnel and families. The Army cut its high-level administrative HQ in British Army of the Rhine by 20% and removed one of the four divisional HQs in the 1st British Corps assigned to NATO. They absorbed the workforce from the disbanded division, and this allowed for three fully resourced and more powerful divisions of three brigades rather than the four, weak and under-staffed, divisions. This improved the readiness of first echelon by removing the immediate need for reserve reinforcements to backfill across the four divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ta-second-echelon--sustainable-mass-for-expansion&quot;&gt;The TA Second Echelon – Sustainable Mass for Expansion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a very clear doctrine for the use of the TA in war that helped to achieve its growth over the decade. The TA would provide the additional reinforcement of units and formations needed to expand the Army in war. The TA provided the bulk of a complete second echelon Division for rear area security and mobility plus additional Corps Troops and Lines of Communication support. TA units would be given enough equipment to allow unit training with an increase in training days to 44 to ensure they could train to a reasonable level of collective capability and there were plans in place to receive an additional wartime increment of equipment on mobilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TA expansion was greatly helped by the Army accepting most of the 1979 Shapland Report recommendations to improve TA recruitment and retention by assigning specific wartime missions, better training, more modern equipment and some improved benefits. Between 1980 and 1990 the trained strength of the TA increased by 15% and since UK Reserve Forces recruitment is based on local patches there were funded improvements to existing TA accommodation. The modest investment transformed the TA over the decade. The system was certainly far from perfect, as some have argued, and the short timelines to reinforce Germany were extremely optimistic, but the strategic depth potential, at least, from the Army’s Reserves did contribute to deterrence and pacified NATO demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-regular-reserves--affordable-reinforcement&quot;&gt;The Regular Reserves – Affordable Reinforcement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1981 Defence Review endorsed the Army’s Individual Reinforcement Plan to deliver more assured Regular Reserves. Their primary role was to provide individual reinforcements in wartime as Regular and TA units were rarely at 100% of their peacetime liability and each unit also had to receive a top up to their Warfighting Establishment. The Regular Reserves also provided the Battle Casualty Replacement (BCR) pools for the Army in this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They retained a basic uniform scaling with their mobilisation instructions for reporting in war and were required to attend an annual briefing at a local TA Centre. With a bonus payment for attendance, 92% attended annual briefings by 1983. There was an optional one-week training refresher for those who left regular service three years previously and many could volunteer to join major exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delivering-deterrence-by-planning-for-mobilisation&quot;&gt;Delivering Deterrence by Planning for Mobilisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1981 improvements to the army’s reserves also succeeded because the British Army was oriented to planning for NATO warfighting. Transition to war would potentially impose so many concurrent demands on the army that an ad hoc approach to force generation would impose delay and risk. This would subvert the future sustainment of any deployed forces, especially mobilisation of the second echelon TA. This risk was well recognised in the Cold War and there was a deliberate force-generation plan pre-written, and exercised, to mobilise the entirety of the TA and Regular Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this plan foresaw a short war it did include detail on how the UK could put in place structures to regenerate and reconstitute for a longer attritional conflict. To be clear, this was not a plan for how to fight a war but how to deliver an army ready and expanded for war. The 1981 Defence Review recognised the importance of having such a plan for deterrence – crucially this included exercising the mobilisation of the Reserve components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the demise of the Cold War the British Army has had little need for a plan to expand and fight against a peer-level adversary. The army has been able to respond to recent operational demands with a bespoke force-generation process often drawing together varied units and personnel from across the army and mobilising small groups or individual personnel from among the reservists. There was no requirement to mobilise and expand the army with additional units. Challenging this “just in time” Lego bricks model that has lasted for over 30 years across expeditionary armies like the British Army and developing a plan for mobilisation that naturally includes reserves will be difficult for the army. Our allies have been quicker to realise this necessity but the 1980’s demonstrates we have done this before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1981 Defence Review is chiefly remembered for the negative impact on the Royal Navy, but it was also radical for the focus on improving reserve forces for NATO warfighting. The Army made a rare comparative success of the review by embracing and investing in the reserve forces to deliver affordable sustainability for the mass required, while preserving vital funds for modernisation. Then, as now, it was not affordable to expand the number of Regular units to meet the NATO First demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment in training and equipping TA units and formations provided a “good enough” second wartime echelon for NATO. Regular Reservist reinforcements were made an offer to attend refresher training and allocated war roles. This effort was underpinned by thorough mobilisation planning and steady funding. It worked. The TA grew in numbers and capability with its expanded role through the decade helping to deliver a NATO Corps that was more capable than before 1980.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Army Reserve could be used to deliver unit capability to the army’s second echelon but to do so they will need to embed the new stable funding model and be trained, and equipped. A consequence of the 1981 decision to use the TA to provide the second echelon to the NATO Corps was the creation of a Long-Term Costing equipment and training programme to support it. To be effective, the Army’s need to modernise training has to include Army Reserve units for large-scale exercises and prioritised use of simulation. The Ukraine war has shown that affordable, older equipment is better than no equipment at all for Reserve Forces. The recent MOD response to changing its policy on disposals for this purpose is hardly encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Labour has outlined a similar NATO First focus to 1981. The Cold War of the 1980’s has long gone but parallels regarding military workforce balance and affordability remain today in an era of increased threat and fiscal difficulty. The increased funds for Defence today are welcome but will be limited. For the Army it is difficult to see how increasing lethality through modernisation while concurrently improving sustainability for warfighting will be achievable with the limited additional funding available. The Army Reserve can deliver the affordable sustainability needed for today’s NATO First focus and provide that vital peacetime trained-and-equipped second echelon mass available for war – but investment will be required. Tough choices indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英第52日作供。控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行周一（3日）結束24天盤問。辯方代表大律師關文渭進入覆問第2天。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 辯方代表大律師 關文渭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎早前供稱，每星期輪流與其中一個部門舉行「飯盒會」，由於一共有8個部門，因此每個部門相隔兩個月才有一次「飯盒會」。惟控方指從通訊軟件 Slack 紀錄中，各部門並非相隔兩個月便有一次「飯盒會」紀錄，部份更相隔數個月才有相關紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今向黎出示他與前秘書 Julie 的 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示 Julie 通知黎「飯盒會」的日期和出席者，包括「飲食男女編輯部」和「美蘋」。黎確認相關紀錄，並稱這些這些部門與《蘋果》無關，而且與編輯部功能無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後表示，除非法官還有其他問題想問黎，否則「這就是黎先生漫長的證供（epic evidence）」。三名法官沒有其他問題，法官杜麗冰遂吩咐黎可以返回被告欄就坐。黎從證人台站起來，分別向律師席和法官席說：「謝謝」，之後帶同耳機和水杯，在懲教人員看管下返回被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師黃雅斌接著在庭上讀出由專家證人 Alan Jeffries 撰寫、有關 WhatsApp 轉發功能的專家報告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭其後呈上另一份專家報告，有關如何從網上下載黎於2020年7月6日出席劉細良對談節目的影片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方欲呈專家報告-包含明報報導等-冀證黎說法有基礎-官拒呈堂&quot;&gt;辯方欲呈專家報告 包含《明報》報導等 冀證黎說法有基礎 官拒呈堂&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前控方證據提到，黎在2020年4月26日的專欄文章〈專橫暴政打壓 我們氣魄不滅〉中稱：「中共出擊撕掉《基本法》，摧殘香港一國兩制特別行政區地位。沒有釋法權利的港澳辦和中聯辦高調曲線釋法，稱兩辦並非《基本法》22條所指的一般意義上的『中央人民政府所屬各部門』，公然向港府奪權。」控方質疑黎的說法沒有事實基礎。此外，黎分別在專欄文章和網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，指稱《國安法》凌駕（supersedes）了《基本法》，使香港沒有自由和法治。控方在盤問時質疑說法不實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭打算呈上由專家證人 Alan Jeffries 撰寫的報告，有關如何下載《明報》新聞、中聯辦及港澳辦聲明，以及律政司司長對《基本法》作出詮釋的簡報文件。不過法官李運騰質疑，辯方不能以這份專家報告，來填補黎證供的空白之處（fill in the gap）。關否認目的是填補空白，強調只是從另一個角度去印證黎的說法。惟法官杜麗冰反駁指關的做法是「走後門（from the back door）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關解釋指，港澳辦和中聯辦曾發表聲明稱它們不屬於《基本法》第22條所稱一般意義上的「中央人民政府所屬各部門」。而黎供稱他閱讀過一些東西，但記不起，因此辯方希望呈遞當時的《明報》報導，並強調：「我不是在嘗試填補空白。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問關，是否想說黎的說法並非客觀上錯誤？關確認，重申：「我不是在嘗試填補黎先生記憶的空白。」惟李官指出，即使辯方呈交證據證明有人說過相關言論，也不代表那人的言論是正確。杜官又指，若果辯方在覆問階段中，黎曾說閱讀過相關新聞，便有理由呈交該則新聞；可是黎只說過閱讀過《蘋果》報導而非《明報》，質疑辯方嘗試填補空白，想證明黎閱讀過相關新聞。關則強調，其用意並非如此，因相關新聞報導在當時社會裡公開流傳，辯方亦不需要證明黎閱讀過相關報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問，就算黎的確有留意到《明報》的報導，那對黎的案情有什麼幫助？杜官則表示，看不到辯方呈交《明報》報導與本案有何關聯性。法官李素蘭則表示，不認為報導可以呈堂。關文渭回應，黎撰寫了一篇文章，被指沒有事實基礎，但辯方呈上報導是為了證明黎有基礎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官最後表示，不認為相關證據有關聯性，因此不批准辯方呈堂。李素蘭並提醒辯方不要在結案陳詞中就相關證據作陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;案件押後至明日-待修改控辯雙方承認事實&quot;&gt;案件押後至明日 待修改控辯雙方承認事實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一名辯方大律師李峯琦其後讀出報告內容，有關2019年的公眾集會和遊行資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方資深大律師彭耀鴻指，黎的案情即將完成，但控辯雙方承認事實仍有部份需要作出修改。接著便會是三間《蘋果》相關公司的案情，大律師黃國豪表示打算呈交一些文件作為證物，需時五分鐘。杜官遂將案件押後至明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

The use of artillery in Ukraine has echoes of the past, with revolutions in application following every Russian war of the 20th century.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the time of Suvorov, artillery was one of the most esteemed and prestigious branches of the Russian military – a view that was largely forgotten by the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. During the Second World War, artillery was extensively employed to dismantle enemy defences and, in many cases, to obliterate entire cities. This preference for artillery warfare persisted after the Second World War, as evidenced in the Russian Invasion of Afghanistan and various post-Soviet conflicts including the fighting in Ukraine following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Despite this enduring characteristic, the importance of artillery in Russian military doctrine has often been overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may not inspire awe in the same manner as bombing from the air, Russia’s extensive use of artillery has proven effective and remains difficult to counter. The significance of artillery in Russian warfare extends beyond its battlefield effectiveness. Through history and to the present moment, its deployment has carried direct political meaning, serving as a visible demonstration of Russia’s determination to achieve its objectives, regardless of the level of destruction or civilian casualties involved. The psychological impact of Russian artillery is not an unintended consequence but a deliberate feature of its warfighting strategy. This story starts in the less remembered eastern front of the First World War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-world-war-i--the-baptism-of-artillery-firepower-in-1916&quot;&gt;Russian World War I – The Baptism of Artillery Firepower in 1916&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian use of artillery on a tactical and operational basis in the First World War mirrors the current evolution of artillery strategy in Ukraine: the emergent use of new reconnaissance technology, and artillery as a psychological weapon and obstacle-clearing tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brusilov Offensive (1916) was one of very few resounding Russian victories during the First World War, wherein, as historians often agree, the victory was achieved in part by spotter aircraft increasing the accuracy of artillery barrages on strategic objectives. The Tsarist Russian Empire was not an artillery powerhouse compared to other European powers such as France or Germany, primarily due to their lack of larger calibre artillery. However, the availability and efficacy of anti-aircraft artillery was limited, allowing spotter aircrafts to patrol the skies above enemy territory with comparative impunity. This has stark parallels with the modern-day usage of drones to improve the accuracy and targeting of artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the increased rate of communication, the impact of aerial reconnaissance does not reside solely at a strategic level, – concerning artillery’s capacity to have significant effect over a wide area – but at a squad level as well. The efficiency of targeting reached through aerial surveillance was part of the First World War revolution in military affairs allowing reliable and accurate delivery of indirect munitions from small unit-based mortars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;General Aleksei Brusilov created warning fatigue in the enemy by ordering barrages meaning enemy infantry forces were not able to anticipate Brusilov’s movement&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the Brusilov Offensive that proved effective for the Russian forces, and carries on to the modern day, was the use of artillery barrages days or weeks in advance of an offensive to create warning fatigue in the enemy. This hampered the capacity to attack only after a significant concentration of force. Longer artillery barrages across a frontline were a common indicator of an incoming attack by Russian forces General Aleksei Brusilov created warning fatigue in the enemy by ordering barrages meaning enemy infantry forces were not able to anticipate Brusilov’s movement due to the prolonged massive artillery attack that preceded. This allowed Russian forces to creep closer than anticipated to Austrian defensive positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lesson is apparent in the current use of artillery warfare with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Considering the psychological impact of large-scale artillery barrages for soldiers in the trenches, the fact that Russia now owns a commanding lead in artillery shell production and manufacture of related parts is increasingly worrying for Ukrainian defences. A surplus of ammunition and available artillery pieces can allow modern-day Russia to feign offensives to draw a larger number of Ukrainian defenders to sectors that Russia does not plan to pursue offensively, thereby denying the usage of those troops in areas in which the numerically inferior Ukrainians need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia still exploits the artillery’s ability to clear traps and other obstacles to deny the enemy pre-planned kill-zones, as proved in the Brusilov Offensive. Barbed wire, mines, and other fortifications are often used by defending forces to control the avenues an attacking force can utilize for an operation, thereby allowing a defending force to establish kill-zones for the enemy. Kill-zones here are defined as the central piece of an ambush site with the following characteristics: convenient and likely to be traversable by the enemy; contains obstacles to slow advances; and has a large enough area that defenders can easily view the approaching enemy and benefit from an advantage in timing. As shown through the beginning stages of the Brusilov Offensive, artillery was used to destroy barbed wire and other such defences to allow the Russian forces to have a greater number of approach avenues.Grau and Bartle highlight the calculable reasoning achievable when opposed by artillery, as artillery barrages have known ranges, timing, areas of effect, and success probabilities given a certain level of fire exposure. This takes into consideration counterbattery fire, although in the modern era this proves less robust with loitering munition counterattack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian military experience in artillery warfare in the First World War laid the foundation for the use of artillery by Russian forces: the notable reliance on aerial reconnaissance for accurate indirect artillery barrages; effective use of artillery in psychological operations; and the utilization of artillery as an obstacle-clearing tool to allow for rapid offensive manoeuvres. The lessons of the First World War still apply to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;world-war-ii-1941-1945--red-army-way-to-artillery-or-god-of-war&quot;&gt;World War II-1941-1945 – Red Army Way to Artillery or “God of War”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia adjusted its artillery doctrine with the introduction of earlymulti-launch rocket systems (MLRS), and relied on direct fire of 76.2-millimeter batteries to provide accurate fire on enemy armoured vehicles and fortified positions. The new approach greatly increased the number of available artillery resources per kilometre of a frontline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the onset of Operation Barbarossa in 1941, the Soviets had successfully developed one of the world’s first MLRS systems, the BM-13, which provided a greater rate of fire and manoeuvrability than traditional towed artillery systems. A full salvo of rockets could be fired in 7-10 seconds and each salvo had up to 48 rockets, with the only downside being the lower sustained fire rate due to a slower reloading process. Hence, Soviet forces were able to deploy devastating levels of destruction upon an enemy in a short time and avoided counterbattery fire through the increased maneuverability of a truck-mounted launch system. BM-13 platforms were deployed in the battle of Stalingrad (1942). After the Second World War, the BM-13 was improved upon, eventually resulting in the BM-21, a highly configurable MLRS that is fielded by multiple nations across the world, including Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the rapid evolution of tanks in the inter-war period, Soviet doctrine adjusted to deploy large numbers of 76.2-millimeter guns and 57-millimeter anti-tank guns to support defending or advancing infantry. Unlike the regimental 122-millimeter howitzers, both variants would be placed in a direct-fire capacity where the crew operating each weapon would not need to rely on a forward observer to engage targets accurately. Laddering techniques, i.e., two guns alternating responsibility for firing on a target and advancing, would be used to ensure consistent fire upon enemy positions, thereby denying the enemy time to effectively engage advancing infantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of laddering fire is fundamental to understanding the movement of Russian artillery during offensive operations. A potential cause of this shift away from direct-fire artillery implements is likely a result of the means of communication used by artillery spotters: from wired communication lines to radio-based. This development allowed for better coordination of fire between different units with a greater dispersion of information, and as more units were be able to receive communication from spotters it lowered the risk to valuable field guns by placing them out of view of the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final notable development of Soviet artillery doctrine in the Second World War was the disparity in guns and mortars per kilometre of frontline compared to pre-war estimates. Multiple Russian experts before the onset of the Second World War recommended between 75 and 100 guns per kilometre of front to break through a positional defence; however, in the later years of the Second World War, Soviet density of firepower on breakthrough fronts was between 150 and 200 guns per kilometre. The disparity between the expected and observed ratios shows the reliance of the Red Army on its industrial capability to overwhelm its enemies with devastating barrages of artillery fire. As Stalin is thought to have stated of the Red Army, “quantity has a quality all its own.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Though the Red Army proved to be far more advanced and sophisticated in both quantity and quality than its direct predecessor, its achievements were based on a direct evolution, more than a revolution, in technology and doctrinal development&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the Red Army’s Second World War experience in artillery warfare showed the spectrum of improvement expected from a more industrialized economy with a greater productive capacity and outcome – including sophisticated Soviet-designed weapon systems. However, as is clear from the Tsarist Imperial Russian armed forces, this does not necessarily follow from progress toward modern firepower and force concentration. Though the Red Army proved to be far more advanced and sophisticated in both quantity and quality than its direct predecessor, its achievements were based on a direct evolution, more than a revolution, in technology and doctrinal development. As a result of this consistent evolution, the effectiveness and broad use of artillery assumed a political importance, testified to by Stalin who is thought to have labelled artillery the “God of War”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soviet-afghan-war-1979-1989--red-armys-artillery-warfare-in-a-limited-war&quot;&gt;Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989) – Red Army’s Artillery Warfare in a “Limited” War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soviet evolution of artillery doctrine throughout the Soviet-Afghan war (1979-1989) consisted of a conjunction of overwhelming air and ground-based barrages. This was supported by an emphasis on smaller specially trained units to follow up a successful barrage. Underlying this was a tactic of resource denial on an unprecedented scale. The Soviet forces had to contend with a competent and well-supported insurgency in a non-conventional war, that erased the concept of a defined frontline and other concepts central to a typical nation-state conflict. It came to resemble later hybrid wars fought by post-Soviet Russia and Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Afghan warlords commonly concentrated most of their forces in positions observable from aerial reconnaissance the initial stages of the war proved successful for the existing Russian artillery doctrine. Afghan forces were left decimated by artillery and attacks from the air. However, the Afghan forces quickly adapted to rely on tactics that spread out their resources in underground structures resistant to aerial or artillery campaigns, whereby they could launch successful hit-and-run attacks on Soviet troops and armoured columns, proving costly for the Soviet Army and invalidating its air and artillery superiority. Afghan forces ambushed the enemy at ranges where Soviet artillery could not be utilized, and putting Soviet troops in danger of friendly fire during attacks that were over so quickly that air support could not respond in time. The Soviets responded by employing engineer battalions to level farmlands and other natural obstacles within 300 meters of roadways to ensure ground troops could spot and engage Afghan forces at a distance that would allow for the use of artillery and air power. While it is unlikely that efforts to level 300 meters to the left and right of every roadway were successful, the fact that it was attempted in the first place emphasizes the Soviet reliance on artillery and established road networks for strategic victory. To this day, close-range ambush tactics have proven effective against Russian forces, as shown in the ongoing Kursk offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soviet artillery and air dominance were invalidated by Afghan tactics, and the Soviets struggled to adapt to the battlefield. One notable exception to this trend was that of the first and second battles of Zhawar (September 1985 - April 1986), in which Soviet artillery, along with a complete encirclement of the underground position held by the mujahideen, was able to break the will of the Afghan defenders after the deployment of special forces into tunnels. This victory by the Soviets illustrates one of the only ways artillery can be used successfully to secure an underground fortified position. Tactics like these only succeed when the subterranean fortifications are surrounded, and all escape avenues are either destroyed or properly guarded, thereby cutting defenders off from resupply and reinforcements, as was recently seen in the Israeli intervention in Gaza against Hamas. However, underground defence networks can slow an advancing army to a halt until a given position is thoroughly cleared, a lesson that Ukraine learned in the final days of the battle for Mariupol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Artillery is seen as an intermediate weapon between the strategic weapons (such as nuclear missiles) and purely conventional armaments&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet experience in a limited conflict shows how a reduced use of artillery can be both effective and strategically constrained, contrasting with the First and Second World Wars, where artillery was the “crown jewel” of a sophisticated land force centred on concentration of firepower. This said, Afghanistan is a rural country where cities or demographic density will not allow for major concentration of forces, the natural target for artillery. When the appropriate situation was realized on the ground, artillery was able to prove its worth once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post-soviet-russias-1st-and-2nd-chechen-wars--a-never-ending-quest-for-neighbor-control&quot;&gt;Post-Soviet Russia’s 1st and 2nd Chechen Wars – A Never-Ending Quest for Neighbor Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian political need to secure the Chechen capital of Grozny in 1995 was defined by the indiscriminate levelling of infrastructure by artillery and unconventional adaptations in operating procedures that included hit-and-run tactics in an urban combat scenario. In the initial stages of the First Chechen War (December 11, 1994 to August 31, 1996), long Russian armoured columns were used en masse in an attempt to overwhelm defending Chechens in their capital city. Chechen hunter-killer rocket propelled grenade teams made short work of these armoured columns, as the main cannons of the Russian vehicles lacked the degrees of elevation to eliminate hunter-killer teams raised positions. To remedy the situation, artillery strikes were called in to level the buildings where hunter-killer teams were thought to be hiding, and armoured columns began to include ZSU anti-aircraft vehicles as they could successfully engage enemies regardless of their elevation in relation to the armoured column. These changes in approach show a key characteristic of Russian operations in urban combat: their desire to take the city or town by any means necessary. However, it must be noted that the negative effect artillery has on communications in an urban environment is a key weakness of this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;importance-of-artillery-warfare-in-the-russian-way-of-war&quot;&gt;Importance of Artillery Warfare in the Russian Way of War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s armed forces still heavily rely on artillery as one of the main tools to exert power appropriately (as in the case of the First and Second World Wars) and inappropriately (as in the case of the Soviet-Afghan War and the First and Second Chechen Wars). Artillery is seen as an intermediate weapon between the strategic weapons (such as nuclear missiles) and purely conventional armaments. There is no reason to believe that in future wars Russia will not use artillery as a means to exert political and psychological pressure, and express determination, both internally and externally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberspace has become a pivotal domain for geopolitical competition and statecraft, where vulnerabilities are systematically exploited and weaponised to advance state power. While certain sub-threshold activities, such as espionage, are tacitly regarded as “acceptable”, other behaviours remain ambiguously defined along the spectrum of responsible and irresponsible state conduct. This lack of clarity has significant implications for the present and future of the stability and security of the global digital ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, states have engaged in extensive multilateral discussions to delineate the “rules of the road” for cyberspace. These efforts, primarily undertaken within UN forums on international peace and security, have culminated in the development of a framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Anchored in four pillars – international law, norms, cyber capacity-building, and confidence-building measures – this framework represents a consensus-based approach to reducing ambiguity. However, its negotiation reflects a narrow focus, constrained by geopolitical tensions and divergent state priorities. The resulting diplomatic deadlocks and ongoing cyber confrontations between key actors – the US, China, Russia and others – highlight the challenges of operationalising the framework in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This compendium seeks to expand the discourse on responsible cyber behaviour (RCB) by examining perspectives that have been under-represented in global debates. Moving beyond the confines of the UN framework and the perspectives of a select group of “capable” countries, this publication draws on region-specific case studies from North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe, the Indo-Pacific, and the Middle East and Africa. These studies offer a critical lens on how states interpret and enact RCB, with approaches often shaped by unique regional dynamics such as developmental priorities, geopolitical pressures and climate concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By exploring these diverse approaches, the compendium not only enriches understanding of RCB but also underscores the importance of contextualising global norms within local and regional realities. The compendium is the outcome of 11 workshops, as well as interviews and literature reviews conducted by the authors, undertaken under the aegis of the Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour, a RUSI-led initiative with over 80 researchers dedicated to advancing regional research on RCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case studies illuminate how responsibility is articulated and operationalised through institutional development, legal and regulatory frameworks, cooperative agreements, and responses to major cyber incidents. Collectively, they contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between global principles and localised practices, offering an essential foundation for advancing both scholarly enquiry and policy formulation on RCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;louise-marie-hurel&quot;&gt;Louise Marie Hurel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the past two decades, most of the discussions concerning state responsibility in cyberspace have revolved around two specific processes in the UN: the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on the Security of and in the Use of Information and Communications Technologies. Taken together, these two processes have resulted in a series of UN resolutions that have sought to determine the “rules of the road” for state conduct in cyberspace. This aggregate set of resolutions has also been referred to as the “framework of responsible state behaviour” in cyberspace, which is made up of four key areas (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fzEU0ZE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Four Key Areas of RCB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the importance of the “framework” in setting an international benchmark for how states are expected to conduct themselves in cyberspace, defining “responsible” and “irresponsible” behaviour remains a highly subjective endeavour, for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notions of responsibility are deeply engrained in institutional, political, economic and/or legal cultures at the domestic level, which provide international discussions with a broadly interpretable language.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The nature of cyberspace makes it particularly challenging to attribute malicious activities as well as to determine intent, and thus it is difficult to establish the actor (state or non-state) behind a cyber incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sub-threshold nature of most cyber operations and malicious activities allows state-affiliated or state-sponsored groups to make use of ambiguity and obfuscation to conduct activities that are disruptive, but not entirely unacceptable or unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only 32 states to date have published their views on how international law applies to cyberspace, which means that there is still limited understanding of how key concepts such as sovereignty, non-intervention and due diligence are interpreted by states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defining responsible state behaviour in cyberspace is a political act and, as such, there are incentives and disincentives. In being clearer about certain types of conducts, a state is also “drawing a line” as to what it should and should not do, which is not always politically or strategically desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As cyberspace involves the activities of many stakeholders beyond states, the diverse interests and perspectives of non-state actors have a significant role in shaping collective expectations on behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these factors shows that despite there being a basis for the understanding of responsible state behaviour, there are still ongoing challenges in taking the debate beyond general agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, and to respond to the challenge of recognising discussions beyond the UN framework, as well as the interdependence of states with other stakeholders in enhancing cybersecurity, this compendium uses the term “responsible cyber behaviour” (RCB), rather than “responsible state behaviour”. This is not to negate the state as a key actor, nor the UN framework; rather, it is to recognise that such a concept might provide a useful analytical tool for exploring responsibility in cyberspace. In this regard, “responsible” refers to the responsibility of a range of actors within the global cyber-security governance regimes, while “cyber” indicates the realm of that responsibility – that is, in or through cyberspace. “Behaviour” purposely focuses on practices and conducts that are seen as responsible or irresponsible, acceptable or unacceptable, lawful or unlawful, in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when assessing state responsibility, this compendium still places it under the broader conceptual umbrella of RCB, as there are many other stakeholders that interact with, support and/or hold significant prominence in global cybersecurity politics (for example, large technology companies providing critical software and cybersecurity services). Moreover, and as this compendium argues, even though responsibility in cyberspace has been perceived as being directly linked to the “framework”, it is not solely defined by it. As the compendium shows, there are other factors at the regional and domestic levels that need to be considered, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The association between responsibility and content control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How specific understandings of responsibility are encoded through laws, strategies and institutional settings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How regional threat landscapes impact how some states perceive what is appropriate and necessary, both in demonstrating responsibility and in defining irresponsible cyber behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;towards-a-more-culturally-sensitive-view-of-responsible-behaviour-in-cyberspace&quot;&gt;Towards a More Culturally Sensitive View of Responsible Behaviour in Cyberspace&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notions of responsibility in cyberspace are negotiated via a series of concurrent (and at times, competing) forums – these can be multilateral, regional, theme-specific or multistakeholder. These forums may not use exactly the same term, but they nevertheless play a role in shaping auxiliary and synonymous references to responsible behaviour in cyberspace. A multisited view of RCB shows how norms and expectations of responsibility in cyberspace can and have been shaped beyond the UN and via other forums, as well as triggered by institutional developments and, in some cases, by cyber incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that these discussions happen in siloes and are disconnected from or not well accounted for in current policy and scholarly literature. This is why this compendium seeks to provide an integrated view of RCB across the international, domestic and operational spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is critical to understand that the UN framework is a product of the time and place in which it has been negotiated. As consensus arrangements negotiated within UN structures, the UN frameworks often conceal responsible state behaviour beyond “agreement” and like-mindedness. It can be argued that there are other components, such as national legislation (for example, cybercrime laws that define unlawful behaviour) and industry standards that equally shape RCB. The UN will likely continue to be the place for these discussions for the foreseeable future. However, because of the specific nature of where the discussions take place, there has often been a narrow view of where one should look to understand emerging state practice and collective views on RCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, equating RCB solely with the UN framework can lead to some analytical shortcomings in at least the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The multilateral nature of the debate:&lt;/strong&gt; The fact that these key discussions take place in a multilateral space means that the agreement and decision-making power over such processes ultimately sits in the hands of UN member states. This also means that non-state actors have a limited role to play in discussions about RCB – including the private sector, which owns most of the software development and infrastructure used to support governments; and civil society and academia, which are not only users of the technologies but also targets or receivers of the disproportionate effects of cyber incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The structure and politics of multilateral debates:&lt;/strong&gt; While the previous point has been consistently recognised by both governmental and non-governmental stakeholders in the context of the OEWG, much less has been said about how the specific processes at the UN and the ways they operate also condition how these discussions take place. There are specific mandates for different “committees” within the UN. The state behaviour dialogues happen in the First Committee on Disarmament and International Security. This committee ultimately deals with the highest level of security concerns. The “framework” of voluntary commitments is crystallised through a years-long series of consensus-driven resolutions – but these still do not represent a legally binding commitment to those norms of expected behaviour. Such structures, processes and mandates have direct implications for what is considered to be within and outside the scope of the UN framework; for example, questions concerning the relationship between sustainable development and cybersecurity might not apply to the OEWG. Arguably, more development-leaning agendas would be considered if – and only if – they were framed as capacity-building concerns that are directly linked to the application of specific parts of the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited data and access:&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of data, public information is restricted to transcripts, video recordings, resolutions and expert discussions with diplomats and legal experts who have, over the years, taken a seat at the table in these UN meetings. This poses practical and analytical challenges for the study of how norms and other parts of the framework have come to be accepted and mainstreamed via UN resolutions. Even though the framework builds on non-cyber references that already provide a foundation for many of the notions of responsibility socialised among member states in the context of the GGE and OEWG – such as international humanitarian law, the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, and the UN Charter – how international law applies to cyberspace, and how other dimensions of the framework reflect specific notions of responsibility, need to be further investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A diplomatic sphere:&lt;/strong&gt; The UN-centrality of the debate on state responsibility in cyberspace means that the debates take place in a space that is often dominated by diplomats, rather than between those who possess the relevant expertise in cybersecurity. It is not often that domestic legislation or national cybersecurity strategies refer back to the “framework” – which is most familiar to diplomats and ministries of foreign affairs, and perhaps to other individual experts who have supported UN delegations from their respective capitals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This compendium invites readers to reflect on how other examples, expressions and interpretations of responsibility are found beyond the international UN framework. It does so in at least three ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going beyond norms implementation:&lt;/strong&gt; The UN framework (and the 11 norms therein) is taken as a point of departure, but not as the entire framing or understanding of RCB. So, rather than concentrating on how these norms have been implemented – as other researchers already have – the following chapters consider how other processes can also help illustrate how notions of RCB are deeply engrained, both socially and institutionally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognising that “responsibility” can look quite different from what has been agreed at the international level:&lt;/strong&gt; Economic, social, regional, geopolitical and even environmental dynamics influence both directly and indirectly the priorities of national governments, including their views on RCB. As each chapter shows, while there can be some consistency in terms of the commitment to the UN norms and framework, there are quite a few other state views that might extend the scope delineated internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring case studies with the aim of providing a practice-based view of how states perceive responsible or irresponsible behaviour:&lt;/strong&gt; Norms are what states have agreed to “say” that is acceptable or expected in terms of state behaviour, but when faced with a large-scale incident, further insights on what constitutes RCB emerge. This is illustrated in the chapters on Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;about-the-compendium&quot;&gt;About the Compendium&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the challenges outlined above, the compendium offers a cross-regional set of views on the narratives underpinning notions of “responsibility” advocated at the national level. The compendium is the outcome of a year-long set of workshops undertaken within the context of the Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour (GP-RCB), a RUSI-led initiative founded in 2023, involving more than 70 scholars from different regions, with the purpose of creating a platform for researchers to engage in regionally based and sensitive discussions of what RCB means from their cultural, social and economic perspectives. These discussions have informed the questions, cases and reflections explored in each of the chapters of this compendium. Chapters cover the following regions: Europe, the Indo-Pacific, LAC, the Middle East and Africa, and North America. The compendium reflects a regional breakdown in accordance with the five regions of the GP-RCB. Because of this, the regions covered are far from being exhaustive or indicative of a detailed regional breakdown. Recognising the limitations that this might present for subregional analyses, the compendium nonetheless provides a unique contribution of cross-regional case studies on RCB, with the aim of encouraging more research on regional and contextual interpretations of responsibility in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Regional”, for the purposes of this project, does not refer to or presume regional cohesiveness, or refer to a “regional” position on RCB per se: rather, it should be seen as an aggregate set of national views (and cases) within a particular geographic region – even though there are case studies covering regional mechanisms in the Indo-Pacific chapter and the Middle East and Africa chapter. As noted by previous researchers, regions are, in and of themselves, highly contested units of analysis, some drawn by linguistic identity and history, others by political agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In aiming to understand debates and factors that might have otherwise been overlooked in international discussions, the compendium makes three important contributions to advancing the study of RCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It offers a space for reflection about the cultural drivers and gaps in the interpretation of “responsibility” in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It offers an analysis of specific cases that provide a practice-driven discussion of behaviours that are perceived as responsible or irresponsible, acceptable or unacceptable, by different governments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It lays out reflections for future research and policy agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research design for the compendium balances inductive and deductive approaches to the study of RCB. In practice, this means that rather than predefining RCB as a concept, researchers spoke to regional experts, organised workshops and reviewed existing literature to identify under-represented cases and perspectives on RCB in the current policy and academic literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapters address the following guiding questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contextual analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the key elements shaping RCB discourse and practice (for example, values, institutional frameworks, legislative developments, operational considerations)?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case studies:&lt;/strong&gt; What are some examples of how the country or region in question has grappled with defining RCB? The cases outlined in this compendium include analyses of institutional arrangements, incidents and national cyber crisis responses, which illustrate different interpretations of what responsibility means in practice (for example, means to respond, capacity to recover and institutional accountability).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaps and learnings:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the gaps in the discussion that have emerged from research into this topic that merit further investigation?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the authors vary in the ways that they seek to analyse each of these elements, they all draw on two or three data-gathering methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literature review:&lt;/strong&gt; All chapters draw from official documents, legislation, policies, speeches, and academic and policy papers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workshops:&lt;/strong&gt; All chapters are the outcome of 11 workshops (two to three per region) conducted between December 2023 and May 2024. The first regional workshop gathered GP-RCB researchers with the purpose ofscoping the key elements associated with RCB for a particular region, and identifying potential case studies. For the second regional workshop, authors invited practitioners to join GP-RCB members in exploring the case studies identified in the first workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unstructured/semi-structured interviews:&lt;/strong&gt; Some authors used interviews to collect additional views from experts and policymakers from the region who may not have been able to attend the workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chapters-overview&quot;&gt;Chapters Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter I, Patryk Pawlak focuses on the different pillars that support the views of European countries on RCB – as well as blockers and barriers. The chapter argues that, notwithstanding the diversity of countries in the region, if there is to be a “European approach to RCB”, this must revolve around strengthening the responsibility of different stakeholders within the cyber community, on the one hand, and strengthening the responsibility of external actors in relation to irresponsible behaviour, on the other. Most importantly, the chapter draws on the international relations literature on Responsibility to Protect to propose a typology for Europe’s “common but distributed responsibility”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter II, Gatra Priyandita reflects on how countries in the Indo-Pacific view RCB. There are common perspectives in the ways in which Indo-Pacific states perceive “responsible” state behaviour in cyberspace, chief among which are the importance of sovereignty and non-interference. Yet states differ on how these principles apply, with most choosing to adopt a policy of ambiguity and/or silence. The chapter focuses on ASEAN and Pacific Island countries as two key case studies on the differing views and approaches in the region, the former having concentrated on the development of cyber confidence-building measures and the latter on an approach to RCB that is influenced by the region’s specific climate security threats and how these relate to critical infrastructure protection and resilience concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter III, Mariana Salazar Albornoz analyses the LAC region. The chapter looks at the views of LAC states on RCB through a combination of contextual, legal and case-based analysis. The first part of the chapter focuses on the disparate levels of development and capacities in these states, while the second part reflects on their still-evolving positions on how international law applies to cyberspace. The third part reflects on the lessons learned from large-scale incidents in Costa Rica and Colombia, and how these inform RCB in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter IV looks at cases in the Middle East and Africa. Noran Fouad argues that, despite regional differences, RCB here is driven by several institutions, policies and intra-regional, rather than cross-regional, agreements that focus more on cyber governance than on “norms” per se. The chapter reflects on the AU’s push towards a common position on international law, among other efforts, as an indicator of commitment to RCB. It goes on to analyse an often under-explored case in the Middle East: the Gulf Cooperation Council and its institutional efforts to promote cyber dialogues among members in a region that is fraught with armed conflict and highly skilled cyberthreat actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being the “smallest” region, North America encompasses two prominent “cyber powers”: the US and Canada. In Chapter V, Gavin Wilde examines how Canada and the US conceive their own responsible behaviour in cyberspace, rather than how they define it for others (for example, through attribution, sanctions and other “sticks” used to deter malicious cyber activity). The chapter reviews key legislation and institutional developments that have been signalled by both the US and Canada as key competencies for them to be able to “act responsibly”. Given the disproportionate presence of large cybersecurity and big-tech companies in the US, the chapter also gives some consideration to how state responsibility is interdependent with private responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this compendium highlights the diversity of approaches, views and experiences of countries regarding what constitutes RCB, it does not seek to be either exhaustive or comparative. Each chapter offers reflections on whether countries in the region have engaged with the concept of RCB and, if not, how they have sought to define it, and provides case studies that can shine a light on often-underexplored countries, sub-regional groupings and incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through investigation of different European methods to forging cyber responsibility – regulation, standardisation, deterrence and assistance – this chapter advances the notion that European countries practise a common but distributed responsibility that assigns specific roles within the cyber ecosystem while clearly recognising the importance of all stakeholders. It extends responsibility from states to other actors, making them explicitly part of the solution. Rather than looking at legal interpretations of responsible cyber behaviour (RCB), this contribution investigates various cyber-driven discourses and practices of different stakeholder groups. It identifies five key pillars of RCB, seeing it in terms of a responsibility to shield, refrain, constrain, assist and uphold. In that sense, this chapter also contributes to the existing scholarship on responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-decoding-cyber-responsibility&quot;&gt;Introduction: Decoding Cyber Responsibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European approach to RCB is characterised by a strong focus on the role played by various stakeholder groups – government agencies, the private sector and industry operators – in shaping the overall cyber resilience of a state, society or community. This is usually referred to as a “whole-of-society” and “whole-of-government” approach in developing cyber policies and strategies. Although crucial for effective and inclusive cyber policymaking, such diffused responsibility – in the absence of clearly defined duties and accountability mechanisms among different stakeholders – may lead to a lack of clarity over who is ultimately responsible for successes and failures. The specific rights and obligations of individual stakeholders are often, but not always, clearly defined in laws and regulations. This lack of clarity contributes to accountability gaps that need to be addressed at various levels beyond the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis of diverse European responses to cyber incidents confirmed that cyber responsibility is a multidimensional concept that relies on direct and indirect causal links between an actor’s actions and the effects of those actions to better capture the complexities of causality-driven approaches to responsibility. “Material responsibility” explains responsibility by examining the direct causal link between actions and effects. For example, several European governments have assigned responsibility for malicious cyber operations against their critical national infrastructure (CNI) or democratic processes to Russia or China. Another approach is “political responsibility”, whereby actors may be responsible for specific outcomes by belonging to specific cultural or political communities in which they shape the worldview of what is and is not permissible. National public attribution of cyber operations that violate the UN framework of responsible state behaviour and national positions on the application of international law are examples of states signalling what is and is not acceptable in cyberspace. Their decisions to publicly call out behaviour that violates agreed norms – even without pointing a finger at the perpetrator – establish the parameters for what RCB means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter defines the Europe region rather broadly, including member states of the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK, and the countries in the Western Balkans, as well as Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. It does not focus on any specific case study but rather offers signposts for navigating commonalities and differences in European approaches to RCB. Nonetheless, as this chapter demonstrates, much reflection in Europe is shaped by the approaches developed in the EU, through which a web of collaborative frameworks shapes the regulatory and institutional landscape beyond its member states. Given clear differences over what RCB means and the antagonistic relations between Russia and other European countries, this chapter does not reflect the Russian perspective on cyber responsibility. The analysis presented in this chapter builds on the conclusions of two workshops organised as part of the Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour – one with researchers and another with policymakers – and policy documents, regulations and statements issued by national governments and EU institutions. The chapter begins by presenting the context that shapes European approaches to RCB. It then discusses different practices of RCB in Europe, and finally, building on this analysis, the chapter concludes with a presentation of pillars of common but distributed responsibility in the European context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contextualising-european-perspectives&quot;&gt;Contextualising European Perspectives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion about RCB in Europe is shaped by several factors that impact the narratives and policies on what it means to “behave responsibly” or “be responsible” in cyberspace. Five elements are particularly relevant in shaping the European context: high levels of connectivity, strong regulatory culture, a significant cyberspace governance footprint, a high level of regional integration, and pressures on the overall security architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Levels of Connectivity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries in Europe are among the best connected in the world. While this makes their digital economies more competitive in global markets, it also creates vulnerabilities and demands for addressing digital risks. Europe’s dependence on internet connectivity and much higher levels of cybersecurity vulnerability compared with countries in Africa or Asia create specific obligations and duties on different categories of stakeholders. Governments are expected to protect their citizens and businesses, and industry is responsible for ensuring the uninterrupted and safe operation of digital services and CNI. Although similar expectations may also apply in other parts of the world, the high level of dependence on connectivity and associated vulnerabilities in Europe have significantly influenced European perspectives on RCB and have fed into regulatory and institutional frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strong Regulatory Culture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the commitments and obligations of different stakeholder groups are enshrined in specific regulatory acts and legislation adopted and implemented in the region. The region is characterised by a strong regulatory presence in cyberspace, primarily due to measures adopted by the EU and spread across the region through the EEA and the accession negotiations, as well as through the Council of Europe’s treaty-making activities. Two additional aspects are particularly important in this respect. First, laws and regulations adopted in the EU provide for robust accountability and enforcement mechanisms through the Court of Justice of the EU, the European Commission and the Council of Europe’s European Court of Human Rights. Second, obligations and duties created by EU legislation often apply to foreign entities operating in EU markets, creating an additional layer of responsibility (for example, the Cyber Resilience Act and the Network Information Security (NIS2) Directive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significant Cyberspace Governance Footprint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect of the European approaches to RCB is that these countries were at the core of the decisions that resulted in the emergence of a complex governance system whereby cyber-related issues are discussed concurrently across different international organisations and institutions. This has occurred primarily through international and regional organisations such as the OECD, the Council of Europe and the EU. This means that European countries were involved in setting the parameters for the current understanding of what constitutes RCB. Consequently, any attempts to revisit the existing legal and policy frameworks are considered as challenging the status quo. In terms of institutions, regional organisations such as the EU, the Council of Europe, the OSCE and – to some extent – NATO are considered cornerstones of regional cooperation. Proposals for new institutions or attempts to concentrate decision-making on cyberspace in other organisations within the UN system can also be interpreted as attempts to shift power structures within the international system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Level of Regional Integration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European region is also one of the most integrated regions of the world, with numerous regional organisations and platforms playing important roles in setting the rules for cyberspace governance. The EU is at the core of this institutional ecosystem. It drives legal and institutional processes among the 27 member states, as well as in other countries through a network of digital and cyber partnerships, such as the EEA, and through the accession process for the countries of the Western Balkans and Eastern Europe. In that sense, the process of European integration has served as a harmonising force. In addition, the Council of Europe, with the European Court of Human Rights, has served as the cornerstone for strengthening the rule of law and protection of human rights online, with several critical judgments setting the standard for the legal framework applicable in cyberspace. The OSCE has set the framework for international security cooperation, particularly by strengthening conflict-prevention mechanisms such as confidence-building measures in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pressures on Security Architecture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, the European debate about responsibility has been influenced by the Russian war against Ukraine, which has tested not only the capabilities of European states to defend themselves in the cyber domain but also what they consider to be critical capabilities for strengthening resilience and defence. It has influenced their understanding of the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and how they should cooperate at the regional and international levels to deter malicious attacks and strengthen the accountability of perpetrators. At the same time, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its behaviour in cyberspace have significantly reshaped the existing institutional cooperation structures in Europe. While NATO has accelerated cooperation on cyber defence issues by adopting new doctrines and approaches, cooperation within the OSCE that focused primarily on confidence-building measures and strengthening member states’ capabilities in this respect has suffered a significant blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, decades of cooperation among European countries translate into a relatively high level of trust and a strong culture of collaboration, which, despite national differences, often leads to the emergence of common approaches to defining RCB. At the same time, any legal, institutional or political challenges to this common understanding of RCB and the existing institutional and legal order (for example, the proposal for a new UN cybercrime convention) are interpreted by European governments and analysts as contestation that undermines the rules-based international order in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;practising-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;Practising Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European experience allows us to distinguish at least four major dimensions through which RCB is defined and promoted: regulation, standards, deterrence and assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not coherently approached across Europe, regulation has become one of the key mechanisms for defining and promoting norms, rules and principles of RCB. Through legislative processes, treaty-making, self-regulation or voluntary norm-making processes, states create concrete duties or incentives for different categories of actors to behave responsibly in cyberspace. This is particularly important in countering arguments about cyberspace as a “wild west” without clearly prescribed rules. Even in the absence of a universal cyber treaty to govern state use of information and communications technologies and the discussions about the application of the existing international law to cyberspace, it can be argued that cyber behaviour is regulated through consumer laws, data protection laws and penal codes. Understanding the impact of regulation is critical. Legally defined responsibilities create specific duties and obligations that impact power relations between actors within the cyber ecosystem: governments over private companies and private companies over their users, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU’s role in this respect has been critical, given the size of its market and the fact that many countries in the Eastern Neighbourhood and the Western Balkans are connected to the EU through various institutional mechanisms, with EU membership negotiations the most obvious example. Such regulation often carries extraterritorial implications and therefore reaches beyond the EU’s jurisdiction (for example, the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR), significantly reducing the risk of regulatory evasion and making the content of the regulation even more significant from an international perspective. Regulation has also become a key instrument for managing the behaviour of multinational corporations and tech companies. The EU has adopted several pieces of legislation addressing different dimensions of behaviour in cyberspace, including the fight against disinformation (Digital Services Act), market concentration and competition (Digital Markets Act), and specific obligations for digital operators of financial services (Digital Operational Resilience Act, DORA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Standardisation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach adopted across Europe to ensure that actors behave responsibly in cyberspace is through setting standards, which provide the baseline for products and services in cyberspace. Standards offer a benchmark for governments regarding the minimum requirements needed for cyber resilience, ensure that the private sector provides adequate quality products and services, and offer guidance to industry operators in performing their tasks when delivering critical services. European lawmakers, regulators and standardisation bodies such as CEN-CENELEC and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute play a central role in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous legislative acts adopted by the EU set clear standards for RCB by harmonising different approaches in the 27 member states and candidate countries. The NIS2 Directive sets out common standards for cybersecurity risk-management measures and reporting obligations, adoption of national cybersecurity frameworks, and establishment of competent authorities and single points of contact, among others. The Cyber Resilience Act aims to address the low level of cybersecurity of digital products and services and the insufficient understanding and information for users about the cybersecurity properties of products and services. Guidance on specific topics, such as the cybersecurity of 5G, complements the existing work undertaken by standards bodies, notably within the Service and System Aspects 3 workgroup of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project. Standards of behaviour in cyberspace are also set through regulation and self-regulatory frameworks concerning content moderation by online platforms. Further, the research community has played an important role in providing guidance on implementing the framework of responsible state behaviour, particularly by promoting the development of a common terminology and monitoring of cyber incidents, clarifying principles for implementing the framework of responsible state behaviour, and promoting results-based approaches to cyber capacity-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deterrence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States practice RCB by strengthening their deterrence postures, both in terms of “deterrence by denial” (in other words, strengthening their own cyber resilience) and “deterrence by punishment” (in other words, imposing consequences on states engaging in malicious cyber operations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of deterrence by denial, being responsible in cyberspace implies putting in place high levels of cybersecurity. Overall, European countries have invested significant resources into strengthening their capabilities to increase the cost (in other words, make it more resource-intensive and expensive) for attackers. This has been achieved through enhancing institutional and human capacities as well as the enabling environment. For instance, legislative acts such as the EU’s Cyber Solidarity Act aim to improve preparedness and response to cybersecurity incidents by testing entities in crucial sectors such as finance, energy and healthcare for potential weaknesses, creating an EU Cybersecurity Reserve consisting of incident response services from private service providers (“trusted providers”), and ensuring mutual assistance during a cybersecurity incident. Despite differences in cybersecurity maturity levels, European countries generally score highly across various cybersecurity indeces and have relatively advanced cybercrime legislation, primarily due to the implementation of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, to which most European countries are signatories. Advanced cooperation among law enforcement agencies, including through Europol, has also contributed to strengthening deterrence by denial, with several high-profile arrests, botnet takedowns and destruction of dark web markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence by punishment is geared primarily towards influencing the calculus of perpetrators of malicious cyber activities by clearly defining potential consequences. The growing intensity and complexity of malicious cyber activities have strengthened international cooperation in this domain. EU countries have adopted a joint framework for diplomatic response known as the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox (CDT). The most significant aspect of the CDT’s implementation was the introduction of the horizontal cyber sanctions regime, with targeted sanctions (travel bans and asset freezes) against individuals and entities linked to specific malicious cyber activities. The CDT does not define what constitutes RCB but clearly links potential responses to violations of the UN framework of responsible state behaviour. Statements are also used to signal how states see their own responsibility. In the statement issued following the attacks on Albania, the EU stressed its determination to prevent cyber attacks through enhanced resilience and its commitment to assisting in building up cybersecurity resilience in candidate and other countries, using all available EU tools (see Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Pall Mall Process&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In addition to regulation, states have engaged in norms development processes. One example is the Pall Mall Process launched by the UK and France to set the guiding principles and highlight policy options for states, industry and civil society in relation to the development, facilitation, purchase and use of commercially available cyber-intrusion capabilities. Although the signatories recognise that states may have interests in legitimate and responsible development and use of such capabilities, the Pall Mall Process aims to address the challenge of access to commercially available cyber-intrusion capabilities that increases the opportunity for their malicious and irresponsible use.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The 2022 UK National Cyber Strategy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK’s 2022 National Cyber Strategy explicitly refers to “responsible cyber power” and clearly prescribes the elements of RCB. The vision expressed in the strategy commits the UK to being “a leading, responsible and democratic cyber power, able to protect and promote its interests in and through cyberspace in support of national goals”. These goals are to:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Protect military deployments overseas.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Disrupt terrorist groups.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Counter sophisticated, stealthy and continuous cyberthreats.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Counter state disinformation campaigns.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reduce the threat of external interference in democratic elections.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Remove child sexual abuse material from public spaces online.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As a responsible democratic cyber power, the UK is expected to operate in a legal, ethical and responsible way. With that in mind, the National Cyber Force designs its operations in accordance with three core principles: accountability, precision and calibration. Key factors that ensure RCB operations include strict adherence to legal and ethical frameworks, robust oversight and accountability, thorough and established processes for governing operations (including authorisations), and cyber capabilities that can be controlled effectively and that are predictable.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Charter of Trust&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Launched by Siemens, the Charter of Trust is a set of 10 principles signed by private sector actors to promote cybersecurity as a critical factor to the success of the digital economy. The Charter includes specific references to responsibility across different stakeholder groups; these include anchoring the responsibility for cybersecurity at the highest governmental and business levels by designating specific ministries and chief information security officers, as well as promoting responsibility throughout the digital supply chain.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an element of “responsibilising” other states, European governments now issue statements on selected cyber activities – a practice that has gained importance in recent years (see Table 1). These statements are particularly useful for understanding the parameters of RCB. Even when they do not attribute an attack to a specific actor, they usually indicate what the authors consider to be responsible or irresponsible behaviour. The language of these statements has evolved significantly, from vaguer terms in the early days to more specific language in recent years. Their scope has also varied, ranging from calling out attacks aimed at degrading CNI, influencing democratic processes or undermining integrity, security and economic competitiveness, to increasing acts of cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important and under-analysed aspect is the dilemma that governments face when applying the UN framework of responsible state behaviour not in peacetime but in conflict. The EU did not reference the UN framework in its January 2022 statement on cyber attacks against Ukraine, but, as highlighted in Table 1, it has done so with regard to various peacetime cyber incidents. This suggests that governments struggle to apply the commitments in the UN framework to instances of interstate conflict. States in the region have also become more direct in attributing specific attacks. In a recent case, the UK, supported by allies, identified China and Chinese state-affiliated organisations and individuals as responsible for two malicious cyber campaigns targeting democratic institutions and parliamentarians. Such attributions are an important element in strengthening accountability in cyberspace in peacetime. More importantly, these statements and attributions often demarcate how states collectively signal and refer to “irresponsible behaviour” and “destabilising behaviour” and how they seek to reaffirm their importance of the commitments to the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assistance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European states also understand their responsibility as providing assistance to strengthen cyber resilience, combat cybercrime and enhance cyber-defence capabilities. Over the years, the EU, the UK, Norway and Switzerland have invested significant resources in cyber capacity-building. These efforts express a collective responsibility for strengthening the overall cyber ecosystem. EU states have led some of the most successful global projects (for example, the Global Action on Cybercrime Extended programme and its later iterations) and launched major initiatives such as the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is reflected in statements issued by the EU. In the case of Albania, the EU committed to “assisting in building up cybersecurity resilience in candidate and other countries, using all available EU tools”. In Ukraine, the EU committed to providing technical assistance to further build Ukraine’s resilience against cyberthreats and hybrid threats. In addition, there has been significant effort to strengthen operational support to partner countries. The EU, for example, has completed two Cyber Rapid Response Teams missions to support Moldova during the country’s presidential election and referendum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for assistance highlights the different roles and responsibilities of the multistakeholder community, particularly the tech companies, industry operators, technical community and civil society.54 Each has different missions and duties, which they pursue with available tools and resources. For example, companies providing services to governments – such as Microsoft’s support to Albania – have a particular responsibility to ensure that their support empowers and enhances the capacities of their clients in the long term, rather than creating dependencies that might become too costly. They also have the obligation to ensure that the products and services they provide are safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pillars-of-the-common-but-distributed-responsibility-in-europe&quot;&gt;Pillars of the Common but Distributed Responsibility in Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RCB can be approached as either a past-oriented concept (mostly in the context of legal responsibility and interpretations of state practice) or a future-oriented concept (when certain expectations of behaviour emerge from agreed norms and laws). The latter has been described by some as a new responsibility-based instrument that serves to govern transnational relationships. This understanding of responsibility is suitable in the context of cyber behaviour, where decisions about the content of global obligations, their allocations and potential sanctions are based on constant dialogue and their articulation with multiple stakeholders, especially the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamic nature of RCB also implies varied understandings of main concepts such as rights-holders (individuals and social groups with particular entitlements) and duty-bearers (state or non-state actors obligated to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the human rights of rights-holders). This dynamism results in multilayered responsibility whereby state and non-state actors bear responsibility for specific aspects of cyber behaviour. The analysis of existing practices and approaches described earlier allows for the differentiation five key pillars of RCB in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility to Shield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governmental and non-governmental actors within the cyber ecosystem are responsible for providing adequate levels of cybersecurity protection for their citizens, clients, end users and key stakeholders. These responsibilities are inscribed in laws, regulations, contracts and normative frameworks such as those mentioned earlier (for example DSA/DMA, NIS2, GDPR, DORA and the Cyber Resilience Act). They are responsible for the cybersecurity of those who have entrusted them with specific tasks. Therefore, all duty-bearers must take steps and measures that actively protect rights-holders from any adverse effects of cybersecurity incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility to Refrain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governmental and non-governmental actors have a responsibility not to undertake any malicious or illegal activity that may cause damage and harm to another country and its citizens. This responsibility is clearly spelled out in the UN framework of responsible state behaviour. Similarly, the private sector has a responsibility to refrain from releasing products and services to the market that have not been adequately tested. Numerous statements issued by the EU and individual states, as well as the self-regulatory approaches by the private sector mentioned earlier, illustrate this principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility to Constrain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When governments decide to use cyber operations against other actors (state or non-state), they have a responsibility to conduct such activities within the limits of existing domestic and international law, as well as norms of responsible state behaviour. Their actions should be guided by principles of proportionality and necessity. This means that states should abstain from cyber activities whose outcomes they cannot anticipate, or which might have a disproportionate impact on their targets. The UK’s definition of responsible cyber power and what it means in practice illustrates this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Responsible Cyber Behaviour – Material Responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility to Assist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European governments have emphasised the importance of technical assistance and cyber capacity-building as a means to support partner countries in strengthening their cyber resilience, fighting cybercrime and developing competence in cyber diplomacy. This commitment is not only expressed through declaration and policy documents such as the ones mentioned earlier but also translates into significant funding for cyber capacity-building initiatives from the EU, the UK, Switzerland, Norway, the Netherlands, France and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility to Uphold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments also define their responsibility as upholding the rules-based order in cyberspace, particularly the UN framework of responsible state behaviour. This aspect of political responsibility stems from their membership in international organisations and their contribution to shaping the existing international order. European states have confirmed this principle through numerous declarations, such as those mentioned in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tFgPs6w.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Responsible Cyber Behaviour – Political Responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusions-and-outlook&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Outlook&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis of different European policy approaches and practices on RCB leads to several additional observations that will impact the future of these debates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is a strong focus in Europe on political responsibility, with strong support for the UN framework of responsible state behaviour. Although there is overall agreement on the goals of the framework and a strong sense of responsibility to uphold it, decisions on implementation and choice of instruments are left to each state. This also explains the substantial focus on implementing the framework as part of the responsibility to assist identified by European governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the attribution of responsibility remains one of the major issues in the practice of responsibility. Legal attribution is critical in assigning responsibility to states in line with existing international law and state practice. Actions by non-state actors may also be legally attributed to a state if the latter acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own. However, political responsibility (and political attribution) does not necessarily require direct causation of harms, and decisions about attribution are usually taken based on nationally defined procedures. In the future, it will be important to further clarify and align such criteria at the international level. The multifaceted nature of attribution also raises questions about corresponding types of responsibility; for example, while legal attribution may trigger responsibility rooted in international law, technical attribution prescribes technical responsibility for providing infrastructure to enable malicious actors to conduct cyber operations. Similarly, a state from whose territory attacks originate does not necessarily carry technical or legal responsibility but has political responsibility to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, while European governments have attached significant attention to the question of attribution, there has been limited discussion about the question of “knowing”, which is central to several norms of responsible state behaviour. This gap needs to be addressed through further research and policy discussions. For example, the norms talk about states not “knowingly” allowing attacks to originate from their territories, but the parameters of “knowing” remain largely undefined. This opens the discussion about the responsibility of individual states to put in place institutions, tools and processes that increase overall situational awareness and contribute to improving the knowledge of states about what happens in their respective networks. This carries concrete implications for other adjacent debates, especially on cyber capacity-building needs and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the research and policy community needs to address the challenges of diffused responsibility. While it is true that effective cyber policies require cooperation and involvement of different stakeholder groups (“cyber is a team sport”), additional work is needed to better understand how specific responsibilities are delineated and understood within the multistakeholder community. The lack of clarity on this issue makes drawing the borders of responsibility difficult and ultimately undermines efforts to strengthen accountability in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;II. Indo-Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;gatra-priyandita&quot;&gt;Gatra Priyandita&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explains the similarities and differences between how Indo-Pacific states perceive the concept of “responsible cyber behaviour” (RCB). While RCB is not featured within the cybersecurity lexicon of the Indo-Pacific, regional governments, civil society and industry have articulated their expectations of what it means to be a “responsible” actor. Indo-Pacific states’ cybersecurity strategies and national position papers within the UN and regional architectural processes maintain their commitment to the global framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Their approach recognises the applicability of customary international law in cyberspace and voluntary commitment to the UN’s 11 norms of responsible state behaviour. But despite common views on the importance of sovereignty as a basis of international relations in cyberspace, Indo-Pacific states have different perceptions of what RCB looks like, including different attitudes on how to respond to irresponsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-1&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unsurprising that Indo-Pacific governments and societies have different ideas of what constitutes RCB. The region comprises over 40 states, including major markets such as India and China, as well as smaller Pacific Island states. The region accounts for nearly half the world’s population and drives about $50 trillion in economic activity. It is also a key arena for US–China strategic competition, with both powers pursuing sometimes-competing goals in multiple domains, including cyber. But the region is also home to regional powers – such as Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea – that are actively attempting to assert their own visions for the international order. Meanwhile, state-sponsored cyber actors, such as those in China and North Korea, engage in espionage, intellectual property theft, infrastructure disruption and financial crime. These activities often mirror geopolitical rivalries, as in the India–Pakistan cyber conflict, where Pakistani-based threat actor APT36 targets Indian entities and India’s Patchwork APT conducts espionage in Pakistan. Geopolitical tensions shape cybersecurity dynamics, impacting how states perceive threats and choose to cooperate. For instance, cybersecurity has emerged as an area of cooperation in some minilateral groupings, such as the Quad (Australia, India, Japan and the US) and AUKUS (Australia, the UK and the US), where states move to share information and intelligence regarding state-sponsored cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines the diverse perspectives from across the Indo-Pacific region on what it means for states to demonstrate RCB. The analysis attempts to capture perspectives from four subregions: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania. Given the wide range of states involved, some will inevitably receive more attention than others. Furthermore, there is the additional risk that more “cyber mature” states (for example, Australia, China and Japan) will receive far more attention, given just how developed and well-articulated their positions on responsibility in cyberspace may be. To mitigate this risk, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) organised virtual discussions with experts from across the Indo-Pacific to test regional perspectives on RCB as part of the Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour (GP-RCB) regional workstream – also ensuring the participation of experts from a wide range of states. The research for this chapter also specifically engaged with researchers from several jurisdictions – often less represented in discussions on RCB – in order to do an additional deep dive into how their countries of study perceive RCB. Insights from these virtual discussions and additional analyses further inform this chapter, allowing the articulation of perspectives from a wider range of states, rather than those that have been more vocal on these topics, such as Australia, China and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter argues that a state’s expectations of “responsibility” in cyberspace are shaped by international experiences and the unique national characteristics of individual states, the latter of which are affected by historical experiences, political systems and sources of insecurity. Variation in national experiences shape how states develop approaches to international security in cyberspace, including over questions concerning attribution, countermeasures and the use of multilateral and minilateral platforms. States also have different experiences in how these rules are enforced domestically; imposing stricter guidelines on the use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) internally may be complicated by inter-service rivalries, poor civilian control over the security and defence apparatus, and/or weak oversight mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the Indo-Pacific, many states are particularly cautious about the principles of sovereignty and non-interference, shaped by recent experiences in nation- and state-building, especially in South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Island states. These experiences have created an environment where governments prioritise preventing the misuse of cyberspace by criminals, insurgents and terrorist organisations. In international affairs, these shared experiences have reinforced the importance of multilateralism for addressing issues of peace, security, capacity-building and information sharing. States in these regions are generally more cautious about developing (or even declaring) offensive cyber capabilities (including for countermeasures) – which can be seen as a violation of sovereignty – and publicly or politically attributing cyber attacks to state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand – cyber-mature states with clearly defined state-based threats to their cyberspace – have articulated national positions which suggest that they are willing to be more assertive in cyberspace, including by publicly attributing attacks. While Japan and South Korea have traditionally been cautious about attributing cyber attacks, particularly due to diplomatic sensitivities, recent shifts indicate a growing recognition of the need for stronger attribution measures, especially in the face of increased threats from state actors such as North Korea and China. Both states are exploring more proactive measures in deterrence and response, demonstrating a different approach from their counterparts in the broader Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis presented in this chapter is informed by content analysis of primary documents (such as cybersecurity strategies and national positions in the UN), as well as virtual discussions and interviews with government officials and the expert community. The chapter has two main sections. The first examines areas of convergence and divergence in national attitudes to the different features that make up how states perceive the international and internal dimensions of responsibility in cyberspace. The second examines two case studies – ASEAN’s adoption of the 11 UN norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace, and cyber capacity-building in Pacific Island states – to highlight how unique international and domestic considerations inform national attitudes to cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interpreting-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;Interpreting Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unpacking the International Dimensions of RCB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines how Indo-Pacific states converge and diverge when interpreting the international dimensions of RCB. This interpretation can be uncovered by examining how states have expressed their preferences and concerns on how states interact with one another in cyberspace. In looking into these debates, this section examines how attitudes towards international law and norms compare between Indo-Pacific states, including the rule of law, multilateralism, sovereignty and cyber capacity-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Law and Norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As members of the UN General Assembly, all Indo-Pacific states have agreed to the framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Such frameworks themselves rely on the UN Charter and the associated rules of customary international law, both of which apply to activities in cyberspace. Indo-Pacific states also agree on the application of the 11 UN norms of responsible state behaviour, which guide what states principally can and cannot do in cyberspace. In agreeing to this collective framework, Indo-Pacific states commit to broad sets of actions that constitute state responsibility in cyberspace, including to not use ICTs for malign purposes (such as attacking critical national infrastructure CNI, during peacetime) and to commit to ensuring secure cyberspace by responding to the misuse of cyberspace domestically by criminals. In 2018, ASEAN became the first (and, thus far, only) regional organisation in the world to formally adopt the 11 UN norms, an initiative that will be further explored in one of this chapter’s case studies. ASEAN also works with regional partners to identify how these norms can be operationalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the global consensus on the collective framework in principle, states have different understandings of how international law applies to cyberspace. Among states in the region, only a few – most notably Australia, China, Japan and Singapore – have managed to articulate how it applies in cyberspace. Those that have articulated national positions have done so as a means of either defining the debate or encouraging transparency. For example, Australia has explicitly stated that it has published its views in order to “deepen understandings and set clear expectations”, given that “activities conducted in cyberspace raise new challenges for the application of international law”. Through this effort, states that have articulated their interpretations have gone beyond recommitting to the UN framework by, among other actions, providing technical definitions of key terms (for example, “coercion”, “sovereignty” and “cyber operations”) and/or further articulating positions and/or policies on elements of how international law can be applied to cyberspace, including subjects such as countermeasures, attribution and international humanitarian law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most Indo-Pacific states have not been explicit in articulating how international law should apply. This includes larger states, such as India, Indonesia, South Korea and Vietnam. While reasons for not producing national positions vary, some states may lack the technical capacity (and/or a sense of urgency) to establish positions, an exercise that requires high expertise in the intersections of digital affairs and international law. Ambiguity on national positions can also be strategic, as it allows states to flexibly navigate an international legal environment that is increasingly becoming polarised by strategic competition. In particular, this allows non-aligned states to avoid the impression of leaning too closely towards one state. For example, some states may seek to exploit this ambiguity to prevent spillover into other issues, which may have an impact on their economic and technological relationships with other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ongoing diplomatic issue is the question of whether a distinct international treaty on international security in cyberspace is necessary. While the UN General Assembly has accepted that the existing body of international law can be sufficiently applied to cyberspace in principle, some states have questioned its value in practice and have instead advocated for new rules. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization – whose member states are predominantly Indo-Pacific states – first proposed the creation of an International Code of Conduct for Information Security in 2011 (with a revised draft in 2015). More recently, many Indo-Pacific states supported the creation of an international cybercrime treaty that would consider content-related crimes, including disinformation and copyright infringement (issues that the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime does not specifically cover), and offer more precision in concepts surrounding ICT. Initial discussions that led to the Convention Against Cybercrime received support from many Indo-Pacific states, including China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand and Vietnam, none of which have acceded to the Budapest Convention. Reasons for extending this support likely vary, but some states did so to ensure that the international treaty would be inclusive of the varied perspectives on what constitutes cybercrime and how international cooperation should function. Others saw a distinct international cybercrime treaty as useful to help to harmonise technical definitions and cooperation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another ongoing diplomatic issue is content security. Internal security concerns shape national approaches to cybersecurity and help to explain why many Indo-Pacific states prefer a cybersecurity policy – or a system of international law – that covers content-related crimes, such as disinformation and online hate. In this chapter’s examination of India, Indonesia and Pakistan, it was found that attitudes towards content security are in part driven by concerns about terrorism. In key policy documents, each of these states has expressed a desire to see strengthened law enforcement and government cooperation to prevent the misuse of cyberspace by terrorist groups. For example, India’s contribution to the 2022 Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) annual progress report explicitly called for “strengthen[ed] law enforcement cooperation to prevent the use of cyberspace for terrorist purposes”. In other states, such as Cambodia and China, the preference for addressing content-related crimes may also be attributed to regime security. Internal security concerns prompted a preference in several states to see an international cybercrime treaty that covers content-related crimes. However, such attitudes run counter to the preferences of liberal democracies, such as Australia and New Zealand, which fear that the criminalisation of such activities might have a negative effect on the freedom of expression online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responding to Cyber-Enabled Threats&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indo-Pacific states adopt varied approaches in reinforcing the principles of international law and the 11 UN norms. Most states opt to use multilateral and bilateral mechanisms to reiterate key principles. This includes incorporating principled commitments (such as those concerning the application of the UN Charter and commitment to providing cyber capacity-building) in cyber agreements. For example, ASEAN member states have responded to cyber-enabled threats by working to operationalise the norms of RCB, including through the publication of a checklist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many states also respond to cyber-enabled threats by focusing inward and dedicating resources to building internal resilience against cyber attacks. This means building the capacity to respond to cyber incidents, establishing baseline cybersecurity standards for key entities, and establishing the legal, institutional and regulatory framework for cyber governance. For example, recognising that the country is vulnerable to being exploited by domestic and foreign hackers, the Indonesian government has worked with experts, industry and other stakeholders to improve its capacity to map out the cyberthreat landscape, improve incident response, and introduce needed legislation to protect critical information infrastructure and improve incident reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomacy is also used to fulfil domestic resilience-building needs through advocating for international support and assistance for cyber capacity-building and/or using multilateral, bilateral or minilateral mechanisms for information and intelligence sharing. Cyber capacity-building has emerged as a key priority in diplomatic agendas across the region. For example, the Pacific Island states’ cyber engagement with Australia, New Zealand and European states involves support for capacity-building in operational, legal and policy matters. Australia also supports Pacific Island states by deploying cybersecurity experts to the region to support incident response and cyber resilience-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some states, however, cyber resilience-building is seen as not enough. Australia, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore have explicitly confirmed the applicability of the law of countermeasures to cyber operations to protect CNI. They agree that states may take proportionate action to retaliate against a malign cyber actor, should it induce the actor to comply. Several states have adopted measures such as active cyber defence and/or have adopted offensive cyber capabilities to respond to potential cyberthreats. For example, Australia has adopted a policy of retaliating against malign cyber forces by disrupting and degrading their computer systems. However, some other states, such as Indonesia and Pakistan, have cautioned against countermeasures due to the fear that such efforts might trigger a cyber arms race and risk the further militarisation of cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another means of responding to cyber attacks is through attribution, where states “name and shame” actors (particularly states) that behave irresponsibly in cyberspace. In the Indo-Pacific, several states – including Australia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and China – have either technically or politically attributed cyber operations to a state. The majority of Indo-Pacific states have not made any public attributions against states (and even fewer have committed to policies on cyber attribution). There may be several reasons for this. First, cyber attribution requires certain technical capabilities – ranging from digital forensics to language skills – that may not necessarily be available to most states. Second, many states choose not to attribute cyber attacks in order to prevent direct confrontation with other states, especially if they lack the capacity to conduct the necessary forensics to formally attribute. Third, cyber attribution may compel states to respond either with reciprocal cyber measures or through alternative non-cyber actions – steps that some states might be reluctant or unwilling to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multilateralism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the Indo-Pacific, states agree on the importance of international cooperation to ensure peace, security and stability. Multilateralism stands as the preferred form of cyber diplomacy for many Indo-Pacific states. Through these channels, states aim to develop common understandings on issues such as cybercrime, data privacy, cybersecurity and the use of cyber capabilities in conflicts. Regional discussions on cyber, such as those that centre on ASEAN, facilitate exchanges of best practices, promote transparency and build trust, thereby ideally contributing to a more stable and secure cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a shift in turning to other kinds of mechanisms beyond multilateral forums to affirm the global framework on RCB. Increasingly, states are acting in coordination with other states to respond to malicious state cyber attacks, invoking international law. Through the Five Eyes intelligence arrangement, Australia and New Zealand have attributed cyber attacks with the US, the UK and Canada. Japan and South Korea have also issued several joint cyber attributions with other states. In a recent development, some states have jointly presented public statements warning of certain malign state actors in cyberspace; for example, the intelligence chiefs of Australia and New Zealand – again, through the Five Eyes network – have made public statements warning of China’s use of cyber capabilities to irresponsibly secure economic goals. The emergence of smaller groupings as a platform for voicing concerns about issues in cyberspace may stem from growing disillusionment in some states over the limitations of multilateral mechanisms in terms of asserting international law and norms. This has prompted like-minded states to band together over shared security concerns. For example, the Quad arrangement’s growing focus on cybersecurity is, in part, driven by shared concerns about Chinese cyber operations and a desire to strengthen ICT and technological supply chain security. The Five Eyes intelligence network’s decision to call out China’s irresponsible use of cyber capabilities is also an example of more transparent collaboration in response to a shared security concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sovereignty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political character of the Indo-Pacific region stands as uniquely “Westphalian”, given recent experiences of colonisation and nation- and state-building. Insecurity about internal security challenges has led to a situation whereby governments tend to be more concerned about misuses of cyberspace by criminals, insurgents, terrorist organisations and even opposition groups. As a result, there are strong domestic sensitivities about foreign interference, including in the cyber domain, especially if foreign states are suspected of sponsoring or supporting certain domestic groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this, the principle of sovereignty plays a crucial role in shaping attitudes in cyberspace, including how states articulate national positions on what constitutes “responsible” cyber behaviour. For example, Indonesia’s concerns about the global proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities are partly driven by the potential use of these tools for espionage, which can undermine a country’s sovereignty. There is a principled belief across the region that states shall not use cyber tools to violate another country’s sovereignty by intervening in their domestic affairs or using force to undermine physical infrastructure. However, this belief is often not clarified clearly in national policy documents; most often, it is only communicated and understood during private correspondence with officials. As such, how exactly the principle of sovereignty applies to cyberspace remains a matter of debate, as few states have clearly articulated their views on what it means not to “violate” another country’s sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fhbjmJv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Indo-Pacific, the debate over sovereignty in cyberspace is most prominently shaped by discussions on “data sovereignty”. For many states in the region, data sovereignty is increasingly intertwined with broader national interests, given the central role of cyberspace in national security, economic stability and societal wellbeing. As a result, Indo-Pacific states tend to adopt a cautious and protective approach towards cyberspace, treating it as an extension of their sovereign territory that requires robust safeguards against external threats. This protective stance manifests in policies designed to assert greater control over digital infrastructure, data flows and digital governance. For example, India, Indonesia and Thailand have pursued data localisation laws and stringent cybersecurity regulations aimed at preventing foreign access to critical data and digital assets. These measures reflect broader concerns about cyber espionage and foreign interference, reinforcing the perception that cyberspace must be governed as a critical domain of state sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capacity-Building&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the Indo-Pacific, states agree that cyber capacity-building – both receiving and giving support – is a fundamental component of international cooperation in cyberspace. Among more cyber-mature states, such as Japan and Australia, there is a proactive effort to provide support to less cyber-mature states, including by helping local incident response units and collaborating on developing the capabilities of security operations centres. Meanwhile, less cyber-mature states have openly demonstrated the desire to receive cyber capacity-building support as a means of overcoming challenges in cyber governance, incident response and technical understanding. Some states also actively use regional organisations for this purpose: for example, ASEAN member states have underlined the importance of international cooperation and capacity-building to support the implementation of the 11 norms of RCB in the use of ICTs. ASEAN member states can also receive support for cyber capacity-building from one another or from donor states. Such support can be obtained through ASEAN’s immediate dialogue partners and/or by using its extensive network of cyber capacity-building programmes and initiatives, such as the ASEAN Cyber Capacity Program, ADMM (ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting) Cybersecurity and Information Centre of Excellence, and ASEAN–Japan Cybersecurity Capacity-building Centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some states have called for states to provide cyber capacity-building without political conditions. For example, the research for this chapter revealed that the Cambodian government is against the provision of support for cyber capacity-building that is conditional on changes to the domestic political systems of states. This perspective is based on concerns that Cambodia has been sidelined from receiving certain support due to its authoritarian political system. Meanwhile, Pacific Island states have advocated for more sustainable forms of cyber capacity-building, as such efforts would not only have a positive effect in building local capacity to respond to cyber challenges but would also be potentially more climate-friendly, given that less air travel is needed by experts from donor states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unpacking the Internal Dimensions of RCB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond looking into the international dimensions of RCB, this chapter provides a snapshot of how states try to demonstrate responsibility domestically. This exercise involves looking into the kinds of regulations, standards and oversight mechanisms available to states to ensure that they do not irresponsibly use ICTs. Across the Indo-Pacific, many governments have the capability to conduct domestic surveillance. However, in a highly diverse region with a complex make-up of democratic and authoritarian political systems, how states try to demonstrate responsibility is not always clear or straightforward. For example, national intelligence agencies do not always make guidelines on the use of ICTs for domestic or international surveillance publicly available. Moreover, given the expertise required to oversee the use of ICTs by governments, not all parliaments are well equipped to hold the national security apparatus to account on its use of these technologies. In the states examined for this compendium, the laws and specific guidelines governing the state use of ICTs for national security reasons remain under-developed or under-explored. For example, neither Pakistan nor Cambodia maintains specific controls or transparency requirements for purchasing and selling cyber-enabled technologies. While Indonesia has legal and regulatory requirements for procuring surveillance technologies, their enforcement remains unclear. Even Japan, as a cyber-mature country, does not publicly detail how its authorities are restricted in using cyber tools. As a means of committing to certain international commitments, some states abide by clearer sets of guidelines for the sale and use of cyber tools. For example, the Wassenaar Arrangement for conventional weapons commits some Indo-Pacific states – including Australia, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand – to limiting the export of technologies that can be used for cyber-enabled attacks. For Japan specifically, it also maintains a general principle on the export of weapons and military technology, which limits it to friendly states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, governments across the Indo-Pacific have attempted to demonstrate RCB by establishing the necessary cybersecurity standards domestically to ensure compliance from various organisations – from industry and universities to government entities. Pacific Island states have looked to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime as offering the gold standard for cybercrime law. Other states may be inspired by the Convention but have not opted to directly adopt these standards; rather, they have chosen to design domestic cybersecurity standards with local considerations in mind. In some states, such as Japan and Taiwan, industries that produce more technologically advanced products and items of higher intellectual property value are subjected to more stringent cybersecurity measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;case-studies&quot;&gt;Case Studies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Study 1: ASEAN Norms and Institutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2018, ASEAN leaders met in Singapore and released the ASEAN Leaders’ Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation. In essence, the statement saw the adoption of the 11 UN norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, as it “recognised” the need for all member states to adopt a “set of common, voluntary and non-binding norms” in order “to enhance trust and confidence in the use of cyberspace”. The Leaders’ Statement also called for further identification of a concrete list of voluntary, practical norms of state behaviour in cyberspace that ASEAN can work towards adopting, taking reference from the 11 UN norms. This agreement further attempts to provide the initial normative foundations for regional cooperation in cyberspace. The decision to adopt the norms undoubtedly reflects the deep economic interests in the value of cyberspace and the security-related concerns held by the mostly emerging cyber powers about the misuse of ICTs by state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Leaders’ Statement reflects the economic lens through which ASEAN member states perceive cyberspace. Despite serious concerns about the threats online, member states recognise the transformative powers of digital technology as a means of bolstering economic growth, addressing economic and social ills, and facilitating speedier public services. Yet, to safeguard peaceful coexistence in cyberspace, officials agreed (at least in principle) that there has to be coordination to share best practices and information on cybersecurity policy, coordinate on incident response, and work to build capacity in less cyber-mature states. On this basis, and with strong advocacy from Singapore, member states agreed that an international normative framework was necessary for guiding state conduct in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the adoption of these norms may also be credited to ASEAN’s desire to play a meaningful role in international discussions on cyber norms. Given that ASEAN provides a major platform for international engagement on security issues and confidence-building measures through both the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit, adopting these norms is meant to be a way to offer ASEAN member states the collective opportunity to highlight how the norms can be operationalised and understood widely, as well as perhaps exported to other parts of the Indo-Pacific region, particularly great powers such as China. The opportunity to articulate what the norms mean operationally would (ideally) allow ASEAN to play a more proactive role in shaping international attitudes in cyberspace. As such, the adoption of these norms is part of ASEAN’s long-standing pursuit of “socialising” major powers in the Indo-Pacific region – this time, by attempting to localise an internationally agreed set of norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that non-interference is a nearly sacrosanct principle in ASEAN, it is also fundamental to highlight that the voluntary nature of these norms allows member states to commit with some flexibility. It allows states, at the very least, to first rhetorically commit to the norms and eventually work towards internal operationalisation. The principle of non-interference will, nonetheless, be a further hurdle in enforcing ASEAN’s capacity to both internationally socialise other states and domestically enforce the norms as structural impediments, including a lack of common legal understanding and an absence of enforcement mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Study 2: Pacific Island States and “Climate-Friendly” Cyber Capacity-Building&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this chapter, the Pacific Island states refer to the 12 independent smaller island states that are wholly located in Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia. This subregion – which has an overall population of roughly 12 million – shares common perspectives on how states should behave in cyberspace. Among others, states abide by the application of international law and norms in cyberspace, meet basic cybersecurity standards as outlined by the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and accept that cyber capacity-building support is necessary to build cyber resilience. There are also distinct threats to the subregion’s cyber ecosystem, in the form of natural disaster-related challenges and the social problems emanating from cyber-enabled crimes. While the latter is not unique to the Pacific, it is a primary source of cyber-enabled threat. Pacific Island governments are increasingly concerned about the social and economic effects of malign cyber activities on their citizens. In this respect, the 2018 Boe Declaration has placed cybersecurity resilience as a priority. In responding to cyber-enabled challenges amid problems with under-resourcing, many Pacific Island states require financial and technical assistance from donor states in combating threats in cyberspace. Because of the existential threat of climate change, Pacific Island states have uniquely stood out in advocating to ensure that all forms of cyber support pay attention to the effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pacific Island states see an abundance of cyber capacity-building support from donor states (particularly Australia and New Zealand) and through formal multilateral groupings, such as Partners in the Blue Pacific. Despite the abundance of support, concerns over the effects of climate change are influencing attitudes towards cyber policy in several ways. First, they have led to an increasing call for cyber capacity-building support to be sustainable, not only to allow local Pacific Islanders to domestically build cyber capacity but also to ensure that any form of support does not have a further effect on increasing carbon emissions (such as through flights or uses of energy-inefficient technologies). Second, there has also been a call for states to be inclusive when delivering technological or cyber capacity-building support. This particular preference is rooted in growing concerns over the implications of strategic competition in the ICT space, as well as the continuing need to invest in (or receive) ICT infrastructure that is not only inexpensive but also climate-resilient and energy-efficient. Existential concerns over the effects of climate change and the need to meet development goals mean that Pacific Island states perceive RCB in other states to lie in the provision of support that is highly empathetic of their development and security needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While no Indo-Pacific state has employed the term “responsible cyber behaviour” as a distinct concept within its diplomatic lexicon, these states do maintain interpretations of what it means for states to be responsible actors in cyberspace. States have committed to the global framework for RCB as a means of demonstrating that they are themselves responsible actors. These international commitments inform Indo-Pacific states of how they expect other states to behave. But underpinning national interpretations of RCB are the unique historical, security and economic contexts of individual states. Attitudes toward sovereignty, multilateralism and capacity-building converge and diverge because of these national differences. How states demonstrate their own “responsibility” domestically also demonstrates these national differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the Indo-Pacific, national attitudes towards cyberspace are strongly influenced by principles of sovereignty and non-interference, reflecting historical experiences in nation- and state-building, particularly in South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Island states. These states prioritise protecting their cyberspace from misuse by criminals, insurgents and terrorists, leading to a cautious approach that includes a reluctance to develop or declare offensive cyber capabilities or attribute cyber attacks to state actors. Multilateralism is seen as essential for advancing peace, security, capacity-building and information sharing. In contrast, Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, driven by clearly identified state-based threats, have adopted more assertive cyber policies. These states are increasingly open to attributing cyber attacks and exploring proactive deterrence measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a seeming trend in which more cyber-mature states (such as Australia, China, Japan and Singapore) tend to have more articulated interpretations of RCB. While it is possible to assume that states would articulate their positions more clearly as time goes by, it is also possible that strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific encourages more states to adopt a policy of ambiguity and silence on cyber diplomacy. With the UN OEWG process becoming increasingly polarised into identifiable camps between different forms of “like-minded” states, a community of states seeking to avoid entanglement may choose to continue to avoid articulating clear positions. While this may seem unavoidable, it is possible to focus international cooperation and capacity-building on improving national capabilities to instead defend against cyberthreats. Encouraging states to behave responsibly internally is fundamental to ensuring that they genuinely behave responsibly internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States from the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region have actively participated in debates in the UN and other forums on responsible cyber behaviour (RCB) since these debates began more than two decades ago. Nevertheless, the LAC region still lags behind others on developing a common understanding of what constitutes RCB. There are two reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is an enormous disparity among LAC states regarding cyber capabilities, readiness and response, a disparity that is inextricably linked to unequal levels of development. The International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) Global Cybersecurity Index 2024, which compares the legal, technical, organisational, capacity-development and cooperation measures in relation to cybersecurity of 194 states across five tiers, includes only one LAC state (Brazil) in the highest tier (“Role-modelling”) and three LAC states (Ecuador, Mexico and Uruguay) in the second-highest (“Advancing”), while the rest are widely distributed among the third (“Establishing”) and fourth (“Evolving”) tiers, and one (Antigua and Barbuda) is in the fifth and last tier (“Building”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, amid the particular challenges faced by the region, cybersecurity – understood in its broad sense to include cybersecurity, cyber defence and cybercrime, all three of which require state involvement, albeit at different levels – does not yet seem to be among the priorities of many LAC states. The LAC region represents approximately 8% of the world’s population and 7.3% of global gross domestic product, yet figures from 2023 show 27.3% of LAC’s population (172 million people) living in poverty. Added to these inequalities, LAC “is the most violent region of the world, and violence keeps rising”, with “the number of homicides per person … five times higher than North America, and 10 times [higher] than in Asia”, accounting for “one-third of the world’s total deaths by homicide”. Besides social, domestic and political violence, organised crime has been the primary source of violence in LAC since the early 2000s. High levels of inflation, human rights abuses, political instability, insecurity, corruption and ineffective judicial systems are widespread, with many LAC states ranking among the lowest in the World Justice Project’s Rule of Law Index. At the interstate regional level, while LAC does not face the same kinds of geopolitical battles and armed conflicts as other regions of the world, political and diplomatic tensions and ruptures among LAC states have increased significantly in the past few years. Considering these challenges, while LAC countries cite a “thirst for development and sustainability … they are often slow to understand the importance of cybersecurity as a pillar for achieving the sustainable and resilient kind of development they seek amid more pressing agendas”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This context has meant that many LAC states have not adopted a proactive or preventive approach to cybersecurity. Rather, as signalled by Belisario Contreras, the “key trend” in LAC has been “a reactive approach, where countries strengthen their defences after experiencing attacks”. According to Louise Marie Hurel and Joe Devanny, “it is neither new nor rare for Latin America’s governmental and other sectors to be targeted in cyberspace”, and in fact, “the region faces many of the same cyberthreats as others, ranging from apparently global hackers-for-hire to groups more ostensibly aligned to the interests of specific states with strategic interests in the region”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, highly disruptive cyber incidents have significantly affected government information and interests in the LAC region. For example, in 2021 the Guacamaya hacker group extracted 6 TB of confidential military information from the Mexican Secretariat of National Defense, the largest attack of its kind in Mexico’s history, which had the potential to “cause a collapse of institutions”. In 2022, the Conti group carried out a ransomware campaign against several Costa Rican government entities, stealing and leaking over 600 GB of data, leading Costa Rica to declare a state of emergency. Also in 2022, the BlackCat group carried out a ransomware attack against the Colombian government-owned Empresas Públicas de Medellín (EPM), one of the largest public energy, water and gas providers in the country, paralysing its operations and online services. These recent incidents have led some LAC states to significantly strengthen their cybersecurity institutions, policies, legislation and technical capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this chapter is to identify, from emerging LAC states’ narratives and practical experience in recent years, a clearer and more concrete understanding of what constitutes RCB for LAC states. More than interpretations, the chapter seeks to provide tangible examples from which to draw lessons for the understanding of RCB. The analysis presented in this chapter is the result of academic research and two workshops held in early 2024 with the participation of leading academics and practitioners from the LAC region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter begins with a focus on the participation in and narrative of LAC states in multilateral forums regarding RCB, particularly in the realms of international law and norms. It then focuses on the recent cyber incident response practice of LAC states, with a particular emphasis on the case study countries of Costa Rica and Colombia. The chapter concludes by identifying, from the emerging narrative and practice, 10 lessons learned that form part of the understanding of RCB in LAC. These cover: confidence-building; institutional and legal frameworks; inter-agency collaboration; collaboration with the private sector; international cooperation; communications strategies; the alignment between states’ national measures and positions in multilateral forums; training and capacity-building for government officials; preventive security measures; and digital literacy and human capital development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;discussions-on-international-law-and-norms-in-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;Discussions on International Law and Norms in Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the addition of information security to the agenda in 1998 UN multilateral discussions on RCB have been carried out through the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six Groups of Governmental Experts (GGEs) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which convened between 2004 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which convened from 2019 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One OEWG on the security and use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) created for the period 2021 to 2025, the deliberations of which are currently ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, various LAC states have participated actively in these discussions. The 2009–10 GGE’s 15 members included a government expert from Brazil, the 2012–13 GGE’s 15 members included one from Argentina, the 2014–15 GGE’s 20 members were chaired by the Brazilian expert and included experts from Colombia and Mexico, and the 2019–21 GGE, composed of 25 members, was chaired by the Brazilian expert and included two additional experts from Uruguay and Mexico. Various LAC states were also active participants in the discussions of the 2019–21 OEWG and continue to be so in the ongoing discussions of the 2021–25 OEWG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAC states have joined the consensus reports recognising that international law is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful ICT environment. This was recognised in the 2013, 2015 and 2021 UN GGE reports and in the 2021 OEWG report, and was reaffirmed by the UN General Assembly. These reports called on states to refrain from taking any measures not in accordance with international law. They also concluded that further common understandings needed to be developed on how international law applies to state use of ICTs, which remains the subject of ongoing debates in the UN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further elicit discussion on the issue of the extent to which international law is applicable in cyberspace, besides its report, the 2019–21 GGE produced an official compendium of voluntary national contributions from state experts participating in the GGE, focused specifically on the question of how international law applies to the use of ICTs. Despite the fact that experts from three LAC states participated in that GGE, only Brazil submitted its national contribution to the compendium in 2021, becoming the first LAC state to publish its views on the applicability of international law in cyberspace. This submission was coherent with Brazil’s role as chair of the GGE and was included among a wider set of measures adopted by Brazil to consolidate its cyber diplomacy and strengthen its internal cybersecurity governance structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion continues in the ongoing 2021–25 OEWG, which has called on states to publish official, comprehensive national positions presenting their interpretation as to how, or the extent to which, international law applies in cyberspace, and two regional organisations, the EU (composed of 27 states) and the AU (composed of 55 states), have done so. Among the 193 UN member states, the number is advancing slowly but steadily, yet many states have still to publish their positions. The number of published comprehensive national positions currently includes only three from the LAC region – Brazil, with the above-mentioned submission of 2021; Costa Rica, which published its national position in 2023, likely as part of the measures adopted to strengthen its cyber capabilities and to enter into international cooperation agreements following the Conti attacks; and Cuba, whose comprehensive national position, published in 2024, was built on frequent verbal statements over the years in the OEWG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general terms, and notwithstanding a few differences on specific issues, the positions of Costa Rica and Brazil follow broadly similar lines in their interpretation of the extent to which international law applies in cyberspace. The same may be said for the verbal statements issued by most of the other LAC states, except for Cuba, which seems to stand well apart from the rest of the region on this matter. Table 1 provides a general thematic comparison of the issues contained in the comprehensive national positions published by Brazil, Costa Rica and Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Kpa5s6S.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: General Thematic Comparison of the National Comprehensive Positions on International Law in Cyberspace of Brazil, Costa Rica and Cuba&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, the reasons for the caution of LAC states about issuing comprehensive national positions have likely been the disparities in cyber capabilities and legal understandings of the topic in the region, added to the low priority given to proactive adoption of cybersecurity frameworks, among other challenges. It may also be the case that this conservative approach represents a strategic political decision by those LAC states to wait and analyse the positions taken by other states, and thus to avoid taking sides unnecessarily in the geopolitical cyber battles of other states in which they are not involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participation of LAC states that have not yet published comprehensive national positions has remained limited to sporadic verbal statements on specific issues in segmented discussions of the OEWG. The frequency of such statements has increased during the past five years. Nonetheless, Maria Pilar Llorens argues that these states face difficulties in adopting a narrative of their own. While, on the one hand, LAC states have called for the development of a distinctly Latin American perspective on the international governance and legal framework of cyberspace, which takes into account, for example, the impact of the cyber capabilities development gap, at the same time, most of their statements rely on narratives and resources produced by states from the Global North and have not brought new, regionally adapted elements to the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel to the discussions on international law, UN processes have also led, over the decades, to the adoption of 11 voluntary norms for RCB, within the realm of the 2013, 2015 and 2021 GGE reports, with guidance on the interpretation and implementation of the agreed norms. These voluntary, non-binding norms contain general recommendations to states on confidence-building measures, capacity-building and cooperation, with the purpose of reducing risks to international peace and security and contributing to conflict prevention through cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the regional level, efforts within the Organization of American States (OAS) have been undertaken to complement (not duplicate) the UN processes. In 2020, the OAS General Assembly adopted a resolution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;reaffirming the applicability of international law to cyberspace and the importance of implementing voluntary, non-binding norms for responsible State behaviour in cyberspace as set forth in the consensus reports of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OAS has also contributed to promoting further cybersecurity understanding, transparency and capacity-building in the Americas. The OAS’s Inter-American Committee against Terrorism (Comité Interamericana contra el Terrorismo, or CICTE) has been carrying out its cybersecurity programme for more than 15 years, through which it assists OAS members in the development of cybersecurity capabilities at the technical and public policy levels. Among other endeavours, it assists in the development of national cybersecurity strategies, prepares regional reports and publications, and provides training to public and private officials, as well as students, on cybersecurity and cyber operations. Under this programme, the Network of Government Cyber Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) of the OAS members, known as the CSIRTAmericas Network, promotes the exchange of information on cybersecurity threats, provides technical assistance to strengthen CSIRT services, and offers training to cybersecurity specialists in the CSIRTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, since 2017, OAS member states have agreed, within CICTE’s Working Group on Cooperation and Confidence-Building Measures in Cyberspace, on 11 confidence-building measures to promote increased cooperation, transparency, predictability and stability among states of the Americas in the use of cyberspace. These include providing information on national cybersecurity policies, identifying a national point of contact at the political level to discuss the implications of hemispheric cyberthreats, strengthening capacity-building and training, exchanging best practices, and fostering multistakeholder dialogue and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its part, the OAS’s Inter-American Juridical Committee (IAJC) started working on international law and cyberspace in 2018, with a view to contributing to further transparency on how American states understand the application of international law to cyberspace. The results of a questionnaire distributed to OAS members were published in an IAJC report in 2020. Among its conclusions, the report reaffirmed the wide disparities among regional states in terms of technical capabilities and legal expertise on the subject, as well as internal institutional challenges, such as a lack of clarity in the assignment of responsibility for cyber issues among the authorities within each state, and a lack of inter-institutional dialogue between internal authorities that could directly or indirectly involve cyber issues. The IAJC organised a training session for OAS member states in 2022 and published another report in that year on the main processes, resources and legal issues involved when discussing the applicability of international law to cyberspace, to serve as a guide to support LAC states in preparing their comprehensive national positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These international and regional multilateral discussions on international law and norms are all applicable to cyberspace and are particularly relevant in view of the fact that to date, there is no specific international or regional binding treaty applicable to LAC states that is exclusively dedicated to RCB. Unlike other regions, LAC states are not part of a regional military alliance governed by common, binding norms to respond collectively to cyberthreats. There are only a few specific chapters or clauses on, or related to, cybersecurity in other more general treaties and instruments to which some LAC states are party, such as the examples illustrated Table 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EBn1KRG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Selected Instruments Applicable to LAC States with Sections on Cybersecurity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these examples, a comprehensive normative perspective of what constitutes RCB for LAC must take into account both the dedicated multilateral discussions that are evolving in the UN and the OAS, and the specific provisions on cybersecurity contained in treaties on other issues, such as trade or data protection. As evidenced above, these specific provisions to date focus mainly on strengthening the capabilities of CSIRTs and the international cooperation among them, as well as on adopting security safeguards for data protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-cyber-incident-responses-by-lac-states&quot;&gt;Recent Cyber Incident Responses by LAC States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the evolving nature of the normative discussions on RCB in the multilateral arena, a correct understanding of what constitutes RCB needs to consider lessons learned from existing state practice. As indicated in previous sections, the LAC region has faced serious challenges in the past few years in relation to cyber incidents. As Hurel notes, “the year 2022 was in many ways a wake-up call for countries in the region and a reminder of both old and emerging threats”. According to Cecilia Tornaghi, the digital transformation in the region following the Covid-19 pandemic, involving considerable innovation in areas such as fintech and e-commerce, “has not been matched by efforts and investments to keep digital systems safe”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines two serious cyber incidents that affected Costa Rica and Colombia in 2022 and analyses the state responses, as presented by state experts during the workshops held in preparation for this chapter. By incorporating lessons learned from state practice into a normative approach, this section seeks to offer a fuller understanding of what RCB means in practice for the LAC region, as well as how incident responders perceive RCB in moments of large-scale cyber crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2022, Costa Rica suffered a severe ransomware attack by the Conti and Hive groups, both reportedly based in the Russian Federation. The attack started on 11 April, when the groups gained access to the Ministry of Finance. This soon allowed them to access other government agencies, including the Ministry of Science, Technology and Telecommunications and the National Meteorological Institution. In total, the attack affected 33 institutions in the country. The Conti group demanded $10 million from the Costa Rican government in exchange for not releasing any of the stolen information on the dark web. The government refused to pay, labelling the hackers “terrorist groups”, as a result of which Conti uploaded approximately 672 GB of data from various government agencies to its leak site. The effects of the attack continued for several months until the end of June 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack occurred three weeks before the new president of Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves, took office. As described in the workshops, this was an institutional challenge in itself for the Costa Rican government, because, as it was the end of an administration, there was no budget left to respond to the attack. On 8 May, the first day of his presidency, Chaves officially declared a state of emergency in Costa Rica, indicating that the attack was unprecedented in the country, had crippled the government’s ability to operate and had affected the national economy, because it disrupted tax collection and exposed citizens’ personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysing the government’s response strategy to the attack, as described during the second workshop, the following successes can be identified:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inter-agency cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; Incumbent president Carlos Alvarado established a working group in April with the participation of the relevant government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multistakeholder participation:&lt;/strong&gt; Contacts were made with the private sector to evaluate, from a multisector perspective, how best to detect and contain the incident. The government received technical assistance from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communications strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; A communications strategy was adopted: on the first day, political and technical groups were created, and a press release was published; over the next two days, press conferences by ministers were held; on the third day, a message from new Costa Rican president Rodrigo Chaves was issued. From the fourth day, a daily press conference was established, accompanied by a press release and a video from which the media could extract the key messages. A protocol for communications was adopted in order to avoid disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; Formal and informal international cooperation with states and computer emergency response teams (CERTs) in other countries was sought. Formal cooperation agreements were signed by Costa Rica with Spain, Estonia and Israel, which proved to be very useful. Israel and Spain, together with the US, helped Costa Rica to restore its services. The country also received donations of money and incident response teams from various countries that were deployed to Costa Rica, in addition to the collaboration of intelligence services (including the FBI and Israeli intelligence). The US has since “announced plans to provide $25 million in assistance to establish a cybersecurity operations centre by 2026”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing best practices:&lt;/strong&gt; Costa Rica has now shared its best practices with other states to promote the adoption of preventive measures in preparation for a cyber attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these actions, by the second week of the attacks, the detection and containment measures had started to work, and by the third week they were complete. The US State Department offered a $10 million reward for information leading to the identification of persons in a leadership position within Conti. As indicated in the Cyberlaw Toolkit, Hive was eventually shut down in January 2023 following a coordinated effort by Europol and the German, Dutch and US authorities. Multisector communication and cooperation, both among national agencies and internationally, emerge from this case as essential components that shape RCB at the domestic level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colombia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Colombia in December 2022, EPM, one of the largest public energy, water and gas providers in the country, owned by the district of Medellín and providing services to 123 municipalities, suffered a severe BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware attack. The attack also affected AMBITCO, a financial company, and the Universidad Piloto de Colombia, a private university. The attack affected the delivery of water and energy services and electronic payments, and created a loss of confidence in digital environments. For two weeks, these services were totally inoperative, and it took approximately 30 days to recover them. In response to the incident, the Colombian government received assistance from the Spanish multinational private company Indra; however, as stated by a government official during the workshops, help did not arrive until 36 hours after the incident began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not the first serious cyber attack against a state institution in Colombia in 2022. In February, the servers of the Colombian National Food and Drug Surveillance Institute was subject to a cyber attack from BlackByte. The impact of this attack included the blocking of movement of food, medicine and raw materials; logistics cost overruns of 35% to 40%; an increase in food prices; and, as noted by government officials during the workshops, a loss of public confidence in the authorities responsible for vigilance and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the seriousness of these cyber incidents, Colombia’s capacity to respond does not seem to have significantly strengthened in their aftermath. A year later, in September 2023, the Ransomhouse hacker group launched a cyber attack against IFX Networks, a cloud service provider, which affected at least 50 Colombian state entities, including the Ministry of Health and Social Protection and the Superior Council of the Judiciary, as well as private entities and the supply chains of technological service providers. The attack also affected authorities in Chile and Panama. In fact, Ransomhouse itself informed Chile’s CSIRT, which in turn informed the relevant Colombian authorities. A total of 300 machines were rendered unusable in the Colombian Ministry of Health, obstructing the provision of critical health services. The attack also affected agricultural services and, as stated by government officials in the workshops, again provoked a loss of confidence in digital environments. The affected systems were completely down for about two weeks, and took around 30 days to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike those of Costa Rica, Colombia’s responses seem to have lacked fluency in terms of inter-agency and international communication and cooperation, and it appears that the country also lacked a wider network of multistakeholder partners to assist the state in ensuring a swifter and more effective response to the incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comparison between the cyber incidents in Costa Rica and Colombia shows the difference that a strengthened and coordinated national response can make in terms of prevention. From the analysis of both cases by the LAC experts who participated in the workshops, the following lessons are drawn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidence-building:&lt;/strong&gt; Cyber incidents erode society’s trust in institutions. It is essential to continuously implement confidence-building measures in order to counter this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutional and legal frameworks:&lt;/strong&gt; Institutional and legal frameworks for responding to cyber incidents should cover not only public safety threats but also national security threats in the cyber realm, to ensure adequate response against cyber incidents affecting states’ infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inter-agency collaboration mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; Cyber incident responses in the LAC region have evidenced a problem of disarticulation among the various government agencies involved in dealing with cyberthreats within each state, and a lack of formal mechanisms for dialogue and coordination. LAC states should establish long-term inter-agency cooperation and coordination mechanisms for cyber incident response. Participants should include both public safety and national security institutions, as well as national and foreign policy institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperation with the private sector:&lt;/strong&gt; The private sector is willing and able to help governments in incident response. Collaboration from the tech industry has proven to be key, particularly in view of LAC states’ limited resources. Governments should build and maintain communications channels with the private sector. In turn, companies should ensure that their assistance is provided swiftly and without undue delay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; International cooperation with states and CSIRTs of other countries, particularly from the LAC region, has proven to be highly useful when responding to cyber incidents. As identified by Contreras, a “significant trend is the strength of international collaboration, with Latin American nations actively engaging in global dialogues and partnerships to strengthen cybersecurity measures”. Formal cooperation agreements should be adopted by states to provide a solid framework for the assistance. In addition, informal cooperation channels and personal contacts among cyber authorities and experts of different states are of great help when faced with a cyber incident, and should be encouraged and nurtured through networking meetings, forums and associations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communications strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Cyber incidents in the region have evidenced that LAC states’ laws and policies lack uniformity on what information must be shared, and with which actors, when responding to a cyber incident. LAC states should put in place strong communications strategies specifically designed to deal with cyber incidents. These strategies should include defining the teams and authorities involved in the response, key messages, an institutional protocol for communications, the ways in which interactions will be carried out with the media, and the spokespersons and measures needed to prevent disinformation. In addition, the strategy should manage public information and statistics, be transparent, and define and show “quick wins” when these are achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment between states’ national measures and positions in multilateral forums:&lt;/strong&gt; Many LAC states face a dissociation between their discourse at the international level and their incident response at the domestic level. LAC states’ strategies for strengthening their cyber capabilities and frameworks at the domestic level should include positioning their views coherently within UN forums.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training and capacity-building for government officials:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a “revolving door” phenomenon whereby the rotation of certain public officers as a result of changes in government administrations results in a loss of knowledge and a lack of continuity of cybersecurity policies. To avoid this, states must ensure continuous training and capacity-building efforts in relation to new teams in charge of cybersecurity policy and cyber incident response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventive security measures:&lt;/strong&gt; States must always put in place and periodically update security measures in their technological infrastructure in order to control vulnerabilities. Moreover, they should encourage continued investment in cybersecurity infrastructure and technologies, including cloud solutions and security software, to defend against emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital literacy, human capital development and education:&lt;/strong&gt; States should continually encourage digital literacy and carry out efforts to bridge the digital divide in their societies. Research shows that “investing in talent and culture around cybersecurity is a foundational step that can drive maturity, resilience and risk reduction over time, benefiting organizations and citizens alike”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The understanding of what constitutes RCB in the LAC region is complex and evolving. From the normative side, apart from some specific provisions on CSIRT capabilities and international cooperation, and on data protection contained in some trade and data protection treaties to which LAC states are party, there is no international or regional binding treaty specifically devoted to RCB applicable to LAC states. Most LAC states accept the applicability of the voluntary, non-binding norms and measures adopted in multilateral forums for RCB, as well as the applicability of international law in cyberspace. However, only three out of the 33 LAC states have, to date, published national positions on the extent to which international law applies in cyberspace. This low number reflects the wide disparity in technical capabilities and legal preparedness among LAC states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this situation is starting to change. Faced with significant cyber attacks in recent years, LAC states have been forced to shift from a relatively dormant state in terms of cyber incident and response, to an active, hands-on approach in response to specific cyber incidents that have affected them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The understanding of RCB in LAC is now shaped by important lessons learned. Confidence-building, strong institutional and legal frameworks, effective inter-agency and international collaboration, strong cooperation with the private sector, an effective communications strategy, alignment in national and foreign policy, capacity-building, preventive security measures and digital literacy have emerged as essential components of RCB in the LAC region. While the normative approach advances slowly in the region, the practical approach to RCB seems to be advancing at a much quicker pace. Seen together, both approaches help inform the nascent regional understanding of RCB in the LAC region as a tool for further strengthening cyber capabilities there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;noran-fouad&quot;&gt;Noran Fouad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digitalisation processes have been vastly accelerated in various countries across the Middle East and Africa in recent years. This can be seen in the growing investment in digital infrastructure by governments, telecommunication companies, tech start-ups and world tech giants such as Google, Microsoft and Apple. In several countries in the Middle East, huge investments are being directed to the building of smart cities, growing the digital health market and supporting an expanding e-commerce market that is projected to be worth more than $3.45 billion by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, studies show that information and communication technology (ICT) projects in Africa increased from 93 projects worth $3.7 billion in 2003–05 to 464 projects worth $23.5 billion in 2018–20. These developments have largely been accompanied by widening disparities within and across countries, adding a digital layer to socioeconomic inequalities. For instance, most of the growth in mobile internet adoption in the Middle East is in high-income countries (such as, the UAE, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia), whereas in lower-income countries, particularly those affected by conflicts (such as Libya, Yemen and Syria), users face low-speed internet and loss of connectivity for long periods. Data also shows that 61% of people living in sub-Saharan Africa live within range of broadband but do not use it, and that Africa as a whole has one of the widest digital gender gaps in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These digitalisation processes have also resulted in a remarkably challenging cyberthreat landscape. For example, according to an IBM report conducted on companies in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, their cost of data breach was the second-highest in the world in 2023, after the US, with an average cost of $8.07 million. African countries are experiencing an alarming increase in the number of cyber incidents, particularly those targeting businesses. For instance, Kenya, one of the leading countries in Africa in terms of access to digital infrastructure, experienced 860 million cyber incidents in 2022 alone, increasing from 7.7 million in 2017. It is thus no surprise that more attention is now being directed towards cyber governance and the need for cooperation to develop regulations, strategies and specialised institutions to address cybersecurity needs in the Middle East and Africa. These efforts have been well documented and analysed by literature and reports in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one important aspect of cyber governance remains largely under-explored in policy and academic circles: the conceptualisation of, practices relating to, and discussions on “responsibility” in cyberspace in the Middle East and Africa. In most cybersecurity literature, the issue of responsible cyber behaviour (RCB) is discussed in the context of the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security and the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security. These are platforms in which many countries in the Middle East and Africa are not necessarily active, and they remain primarily dominated by the superpowers. This is not to suggest that there is an absence of discussions on responsibility in these regions; rather, it indicates different prioritisation and conceptualisation of what RCB should entail or address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas responsibility in Western discourse is more focused on state-launched or state-backed cyber attacks targeting other states, the focus in many countries in the Middle East and Africa is on combating cybercrime by non-state actors as a key challenge facing the digital economy – as shown in this chapter. “State responsibility” may refer to building capacities to detect and mitigate cybercrimes, due diligence or raising awareness. Importantly, in these two regions, many discussions that are relevant to the concept and practice of RCB do not happen on conventional diplomatic platforms, but rather are driven by several institutions, policies and intra-regional (rather than cross-regional) agreements that focus more on cyber governance than on “norms” per se. Further, scrutiny of state behaviour in cyberspace is often pushed forward by civil society organisations, aimed at holding governments accountable as part of a larger framework of respecting human rights and individual freedoms. All such developments take place in challenging geopolitical contexts that may slow progress on reaching agreements on a specific meaning of “responsibility”. The fact that, at the time of writing, more than 45 armed conflicts are taking place in the Middle East and North Africa, while Africa has the second-highest number of armed conflicts of any region in the world, challenges prospects for increasing cooperation within and among countries to develop unified “national” or “regional” perspectives on cybersecurity issues more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this background, this chapter seeks to address the aforementioned gap in research and analysis by developing regionally grounded understandings of RCB in practice. This is achieved in two ways: through desk-based research on regional dynamics and countries’ perspectives and responses to evolving cybersecurity challenges, and through targeted workshops with local and international cybersecurity experts focusing on countries in the Middle East and Africa. The chapter reflects and builds on the viewpoints of academics and practitioners in the Middle East and Africa, which were collated in three online workshops run in December 2023 and January 2024 by RUSI’s Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour (GP-RCB). The key question on which the discussions in these workshops were based was: what does RCB mean to this region from a practical perspective?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a regional composition that reflects the GP-RCB’s regional structure, the chapter aims to outline key themes, research areas and questions that will inform future research on countries in the Middle East and Arica. The chapter acknowledges the complex and extensive political and socioeconomic differences between countries in these regions, and highlights the need for separate analysis in future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the chapter aims to introduce perspectives that go beyond the obvious “big players” in the Middle East and Africa, be they Israel or Iran, Kenya or Nigeria. Although it acknowledges the prominent roles these countries play in digital spaces and their influence on regional cybersecurity discussions, the chapter addresses gaps in the literature and develops the research on RCB by shifting the analysis beyond the major powers. The aim is to create more space for other significant actors who may be under-represented in research and analysis on RCB. Accordingly, in workshop discussions, two important case studies appeared as relevant starting points for analysis: the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the AU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice of these two case studies was made inductively following the first workshop, in which both organisations were highlighted as significant players in current cybersecurity governance efforts in their respective regions. There are many big players in the Middle East, making it difficult to offer a comprehensive understanding of the entire region, given scope, research design and space limitations. Added to this is the problematic – and inherently contested – concept of the “Middle East” as a “region” as such, which masks differences among countries. The GCC was chosen as a case study due to the status that its countries enjoy in technology leadership, both in the Middle East and around the world. As James Shires argues, “the Middle East” has a different connotation in the world of cybersecurity from that which it has in general international relations literature, with most of the Middle East events and conferences that tackle cybersecurity centred on the GCC countries. The AU, meanwhile, has been playing a major role in cybersecurity governance and digital policy in Africa since the adoption of the AU Convention on Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection in 2014. Despite the various persistent challenges to developing a “common” position on, or approach to, responsibility in Africa, as discussed later in the chapter, the AU has managed to institutionalise many of its initiatives, which warrants further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this chapter, therefore, is to identify areas where understandings of responsibility or (un)acceptable state behaviour have been prominent in existing cyber governance initiatives or state cyber practices; areas where the development of such understandings at the national, bilateral or regional levels is impeded or challenged; and areas where opportunities for advancing responsibility in governing cybersecurity can be realised. The chapter is divided into three sections. The first analyses the peculiarities of RCB in the Middle East and Africa as a dimension of the efforts to govern cybersecurity and cyberspace within complex political and geopolitical contexts. The second and third sections consider the specificities of the two case studies, the GCC and the AU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;responsible-cyber-behaviour-through-a-regional-lens&quot;&gt;Responsible Cyber Behaviour Through a Regional Lens&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main conclusions emerging from workshop discussions was that international debates on RCB mostly assume that the key threats to address are those engendered by states or by the most sophisticated cyber actors targeting other countries – a view that does not necessarily reflect perceptions in the Global South. As noted by participants, in many countries in the Middle East and Africa, the question of RCB is primarily triggered by domestic politics – for example, states’ use of cyber tools against citizens, or the abuse of certain technologies. In such cases, it is mostly civil society organisations that trigger conversations on holding states accountable for any abuse of their cyber power. The cyberthreat landscape is slightly different too, with cybercrimes such as business email compromise, ransomware and phishing being seen as the most important in cybersecurity discussions in these regions. As many studies show, unlike advanced economies, emerging economies must develop novel policies and institutions to address cyberthreats, particularly those targeting the financial sector. This poses various policy challenges, given the limited cyber capacities, human capital and financial resources of many such countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking specifically at Middle East states’ perspectives, RCB appears to be primarily approached in terms of building state capabilities to detect and mitigate cyberthreats. Many countries have been persistently building their cyber capabilities, passing laws aimed at securing internet communications (for example, around 13 Arab countries have enacted some form of cybercrime or computer crime law), and establishing national cyber incident response protocols. The idea of using such capabilities “responsibly” has been largely tied to protecting national security interests. For example, the UAE was one of the first countries in the region to cooperate with allies, including the US and the UK, in order to establish its National Electronic Security Authority and to develop a national cyber strategy. Such efforts specifically linked building the state’s cyber capabilities and intelligence-gathering with defence against terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second aspect of responsibility from states’ perspective, as discussed in the Middle East workshop, can be seen in external engagement with partners on cyber governance initiatives. Although the participation of Middle Eastern countries in UN forums such as the GGE has generally been sporadic, and only four countries from the region are signatories to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Israel, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey), there have been other notable efforts to solidify external engagement and combat cybercrime. In 2010, for instance, the Arab League issued the Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences, with the aim of strengthening cooperation between states to defend against cybercrimes. Egypt has been particularly active in internet governance initiatives and in the World Summit for Information Society (WSIS). Following resolutions issued at the WSIS, the Arab Internet Governance Forum (Arab IGF) was established in 2012 to monitor developments relating to internet governance in the region; it has since hosted various meetings, including in Kuwait in 2012, Algeria in 2013, Beirut in 2014 and 2015, and Cairo in 2020. Similarly, through negotiations with Oman, Saudi Arabia gave funding to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to establish the Arab Region Cybersecurity Centre in 2013 in order to enhance regional cooperation. Most recently, the Arab League announced the formation of the Council of Arab Ministers of Cybersecurity, proposed by Saudi Arabia, with Riyadh approved as the headquarters. The Council will have the mission of developing strategies and initiatives to enhance Arab collective efforts on cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, information operations have been integral to cybersecurity approaches in the Middle East region. Several information campaigns to influence public opinion or push forward certain narratives have been repeatedly launched by governments, including in Iran, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Further, cybersecurity infrastructure that enables mass surveillance and solidifies government control over information has been widely adopted as part of states’ responsibility to combat “terrorism” and protect national security. This was particularly heightened during the Arab uprising in 2011, when many governments increased their control over cyberspace and broadened their use of digital surveillance tools. Such policies are widely adopted, particularly for monitoring social media. For example, in 2019, the Turkish government accused voices on social media critical of its military operation in Syria of “terrorism” and subjected them to detention, criminal investigations and travel bans. This approach is reflected in cybercrime laws in the region, as many include provisions that limit free speech online. In 2023, for example, Jordan adopted a new – heavily criticised – cybercrime law that increases government control over online content and criminalises posts that promote “immorality”, demonstrate “contempt for religion” or undermine “national unity”. Such practices create an environment of mistrust in government initiatives and impede prospects for stakeholder engagement in developing a coherent national, bilateral or regional approach to RCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prospects for cooperation on cyber governance are further challenged by the complexities of the geopolitical context. The Middle East has been riddled with various geopolitical conflicts and rifts that are persistently reflected in cyberspace. This is particularly true in the case of Iran and its long-standing rivalry with Israel and many Arab countries. Several attacks have been widely attributed to the Iranian government since the targeting of the Saudi company Aramco in 2012. For example, in 2020, Iran was accused of launching a cyber attack on water utility networks in Israel and the UAE, leading to what the media labelled a retaliatory measure from Israel, which allegedly hacked into the Iranian port of Shahid Rajaee, one of the country’s most important logistics hubs, disrupting its operations. Several other carefully calibrated attacks have been launched against Iran, including those by Predatory Sparrow, a hacking group believed to be linked to Israel. The threat that Iran poses to many countries in the region has historically played a major role in Arab–Israeli rapprochement and was one of the driving forces behind the 2020 Abraham Accords, the bilateral agreements on Arab–Israeli normalisation signed by Israel and several countries in the region, including Bahrain, the UAE, Morocco and Sudan. Intra-state conflicts have similarly been spilling into the cyber world, through non-state groups or militias that repeatedly target governments, including Cyber Hezbollah, the Syrian Electronic Army and the Yemen Cyber Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is slightly different in Africa, as it is widely believed that many African countries lack the technical capacity to develop sophisticated tools for offensive cyber operations. This comes with a few exceptions, however, including reports about the Moroccan government hacking the phones of Algerian politicians using Pegasus spyware in 2021. What has been extensively reported is states’ use of cyber espionage to target political dissidents, either abroad, such as in operations conducted by the government of Ethiopia, or domestically, as in the case of Uganda. Matters are complicated by the presence of multiple intra-state armed conflicts in the region, including those in Cameroon, Congo, Ethiopia and Mali. Many countries have pushed for responsibility in relation to preventing advanced economies from using offensive cyber tools to target other states. Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt are among those that have voiced concerns about many countries’ growing militarisation of ICTs and stockpiling of vulnerabilities (keeping software and hardware vulnerabilities that are unknown to vendors for future use), and have demanded more transparency in reporting such vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many disparities in technical capacities, political structures and legislative frameworks in African countries that cast a shadow over their ability to coordinate RCB standards. Some, such as Mauritius and Tanzania, stand out as leaders in cybersecurity, through their engagement in cross-border collaborations, investments in ICT infrastructure and active computer emergency response teams. Other countries, however, either do not have sufficient economic or technical capacities to prioritise cybersecurity, or are crippled by political instability and armed conflicts that hinder cybersecurity initiatives. Such disparities make harmonisation of standards and practices of cyber governance a challenge. Added to this are disparities in approaches to external partners, with some countries aligning with Russia and China, and others leaning towards partners in the West. This warrants further research to see how the positions of Middle Eastern and African countries might differ from other countries playing the same manoeuvring strategy between superpowers, for example India and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenging nature of developing a harmonised regional approach to cyber governance, subregions and subregional organisations have been making progress in coordinating their efforts. These include the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the East African Community (EAC), the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). The role played by these communities helps in developing frameworks and directives that address the question of responsibility. One notable example was the ruling by the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice that Togo’s decision to shut down the internet amid protests against the government in 2017 was illegal and a breach of citizens’ freedom of expression. The court also ruled that Nigeria’s seven-month Twitter ban in 2021 was illegal and that the government must amend a controversial section in its cybercrime law that is widely believed to harm freedom of expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, some states have been implementing unilateral or bilateral initiatives on cybersecurity cooperation. One example of this is the collaboration between Togo and the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) to host the first African heads of state Cybersecurity Summit in 2022, which culminated in the Lomé Declaration on cybersecurity. This declaration signified a commitment from more than 27 countries in the region to foster cybersecurity initiatives. Kenya has also been playing a leading role in East Africa to promote and advance cyber governance. Added to this are other non-state and multistakeholder platforms that have been pushing for responsibility issues, including the Africa Internet Governance Forum (AfIGF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous capacity-building projects directed towards Africa that experts believe should be geared towards ensuring implementation, accountability and responsibility, rather than the current focus on training alone. The Council of Europe, for example, on the basis of mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs), is committed to capacity-building in Nigeria and is working with the Ministry of Justice to revise the cybercrime legal framework that has been questioned by the ECOWAS court. This is a subtle approach to demanding accountability where capacity-building is strategically directed at enhancing RCB rather than at trainings alone, which do not contextualise cyber capacity-building to local needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, several constraints were outlined in the Africa workshop discussions that limit progress on issues of responsibility in various ways. First, these constraints impede the development of rules, legislation and institutions to address the question of RCB, domestically and regionally. Second, they challenge the formation of coherent, regional cybersecurity positions that would counter the dominant, often Western-centric narratives on cyber norms and RCB. Third, even within each region, it is often difficult to translate regional, multilateral initiatives into national implementation and priorities. These constraints, as well as potential cooperation enablers, are discussed further in the next two sections, with the GCC and the AU as case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-gulf-cooperation-council&quot;&gt;The Gulf Cooperation Council&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions on and interest in cyber governance have been growing rapidly in the GCC in recent years. Even during a temporary paralysis of cooperation due to a rift between the UAE and Qatar as part of what is often called the “diplomatic crisis” of 2017–21 – initiated mostly after reports indicated that the UAE government had allegedly hacked into the Qatari state news agency – discussions at technical levels continued. Hence, after a long period of inactivity in UN processes and ad hoc committees, most GCC countries are now developing strong national coherence, statements and positions to articulate their cybersecurity approaches. For example, the national cybersecurity authorities in Saudi Arabia and Qatar have international diplomacy departments that have been vocal on cybersecurity issues. Both institutions have also recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance joint cooperation. This was followed by Qatar announcing the launch of its National Cybersecurity Strategy 2024–2030. Further, there is a growing projection of national cybersecurity capability on the global stage through multiple platforms, including the Global Cybersecurity Forum held in Riyadh and the GISEC Global Conference held in Dubai, in which various global partners participate to share knowledge and know-how on cybersecurity-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At an organisational level, there have been multiple efforts to institutionalise cybersecurity initiatives and foster cooperation among countries in the region. This can be seen in the establishment of the Permanent Committee and Ministerial Committee for Cybersecurity in the GCC, aimed at enhancing cooperation and developing joint policies and procedures to address cyberthreats. There are also growing efforts at collaboration with other external allies, including the US, the UK and the EU. This can be seen, for example, in the convening of the GCC–US working group specialising in cybersecurity, whose establishment was endorsed in a security-related ministerial workgroup with both sides. The same goes for negotiations between the GCC and the UK on a free-trade agreement, which would have significant implications for fostering security cooperation between the two parties – especially on cybersecurity, a key area in negotiations thus far. Moreover, a recent high-level forum between the GCC and the EU on regional security and cooperation included cybersecurity as one of five key areas of proposed cooperation. This is part of bigger security cooperation initiatives such as the establishment of the Gulf Academy for Strategic and Security Studies as an affiliate of the GCC, based in the UAE, with the goal of providing cybersecurity training to GCC leaders and developing shared understanding on security issues in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two key issues have been receiving the most attention from GCC countries. The first is the protection of critical national infrastructure (CNI), a response to multiple cyber attacks that targeted CNI sectors in the region, particularly the oil and gas industries. The second is information sharing on social media and the extent to which it challenges state sovereignty. Since 2011, there have been an increasing number of arbitrary arrests and travel bans imposed on critics and activists in the Gulf region, and a growing crackdown on online expression. Governments’ punitive actions in relation to what they label “fake news” as part of their cybercrime laws are likely to remain a divisive issue. This is further complicated by GCC governments’ increasing engagement with problematic private actors, which diminishes the prospect of civil society involvement in defining government responsibility. For example, numerous reports have been published about the use by the governments of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Oman of Pegasus spyware, developed by Israeli company NSO Group, to target activists. Another prominent case is that of the UAE company, Dark Matter, which recruited former intelligence operatives from the US and Israel to launch espionage operations targeting other governments and human rights activists. As a response, discussions in both the Middle East and Africa workshops emphasised the importance of civil society initiatives, which have been increasingly active in creating fact-checking pages to target misinformation and disinformation on social media platforms, advocating for women’s rights, campaigning to boycott certain private sector companies, and making a general push for legislation in support of human rights and freedom of speech in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in discussions with experts in the GCC workshop, many GCC governments regulate technology markets and invest heavily in technology companies and incubators. Governments are already pushing entrepreneurs to invest some of those funds in securing their software and hardware products. Therefore, the question of responsibility for governments’ direct investment choices is important to explore, given their powerful role. This could be a potential area of collaboration, particularly when such investments are directed towards or received from foreign companies, whether American, Russian, Chinese or from other countries. Such collaboration must, however, take into consideration the substantial differences among GCC countries in terms of cyber capabilities, readiness, diplomatic efforts and general awareness of cybersecurity issues, which result in continuous competition. As outlined at the Middle East workshop discussions, such disparities can be seen, for instance, in the relationship between the GCC countries and global technology companies. Major cloud and social media companies see the region as a very attractive market, but their offerings in terms of infrastructure and R&amp;amp;D vary across countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note too that the prospect of economic cooperation as a driver for more collaborative cybersecurity governance, whether among GCC countries or between the AU and other countries in the Middle East, is complicated by the geopolitical situation. In June 2023, the UAE’s cybersecurity chief said at the Cyber Week Conference in Tel Aviv, “Thank God for the Abraham Accords”. This signified the willingness of the UAE to maximise its cooperation with Israel on cybersecurity matters, predominantly in combating threats from Iran as a common “enemy”. However, the Abraham Accords have since been challenged by the war in Gaza. For example, Saudi Arabia has declared that it will not establish ties with Israel before the latter ends its war in Gaza, nor before an independent Palestinian state is established – how this would affect the state of cybersecurity in the region is a question that remains. The use of high-tech and automated weapons in Gaza, either for targeting or surveillance, will likely have regional and global implications for the conversation on RCB more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-african-union&quot;&gt;The African Union&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, various AU initiatives have demonstrated the significance of cybersecurity in the region’s policy agenda to foster the digital economy and improve internet access and availability. The Digital Transformation Strategy 2020–2030 is a case in point, in which the AU Commission identified cybersecurity, privacy and personal data protection as some of the cross-cutting themes for digital transformation to achieve prosperity and inclusivity. In addition, cyber governance has been approached as fundamental to economic growth and the eradication of poverty, as part of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement. The Policy and Regulation Initiative for Digital Africa, a joint initiative among the AU, the EU and the ITU, is another important initiative that solidifies cooperation and conversations with international partners on RCB. Most recently, the AU’s Convention on Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection, also known as the Malabo Convention, entered into force in July 2023, signed by only 16 countries, nine years after it was adopted. Although it remains unratified by most AU countries, the Malabo Convention offers a basis for instigating a discussion on RCB, through its reaffirmation of a commitment to international human rights conventions – fundamental in the UN context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the issue of state responsibility, the AU has taken a primarily informal and indirect approach, framed around the application of the international law on cyberspace. For instance, in November 2022, the AU’s Peace and Security Council (PSC) acknowledged for the first time the applicability of international law to cyberspace, noting that “the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law are also applicable to cyberspace”. Most recently, in January 2024, the PSC adopted the Common African Position on the Application of International Law to the Use of ICTs in Cyberspace, which stresses respect for the territorial sovereignty of states, the prohibition of the use of force or intervention in states’ affairs, and the obligation to combat malicious conduct in cyberspace by non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securing the digital economy, and particularly fintech, is one of the key areas where common understanding has been developed. For example, 44 countries signed up to the African Continental Free Trade Area in 2018 with the purpose of facilitating digital trade in Africa – including cybersecurity and online safety. Another promising initiative in this regard is the Smart Africa alliance, which includes 39 countries and is aimed at accelerating sustainable development in Africa through the use of ICTs. As noted by participants in the Africa workshop, the alliance has been promoting important projects, including the bulk purchase of wholesale submarine and satellite internet bandwidth, along with several other joint investments. Such initiatives do not reflect a “traditional” UN interpretation of RCB seen through an international peace and security lens, but they are likely to push all governments to engage in reaching a common or shared understanding of how responsibility – when seen through the lens of development in a digital economy that includes security (of data and systems) – can also refer to the responsibility to invest collectively in efforts to secure cross-border connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of global cooperation, multiple initiatives hold promise, including cooperation with law enforcement agencies in countries of the Global North by sharing information. Initiatives between Interpol and Afripol (the African Union Mechanism for Police Cooperation), which have launched an operation to combat cybercrime in 25 African countries, are an important example. It is important to note here, however, and as highlighted by expert conversations in the workshops, that any cooperation for information sharing with governments in the West should be done within MLATs to make sure that the obligation to share information goes both ways and does not only benefit one side. Such treaties could themselves be used to share best practices among participating states and to foster conversations on RCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts pointed out a general disconnect between researchers and policymakers in many countries in Africa. This problem is twofold. On one side, there is not enough research-enabling data, particularly regarding government practices, or clear communication of government priorities. On the other, there are not enough calls from governments for researchers to be involved in agenda-setting on cybersecurity issues, due either to a lack of infrastructure or platforms that would help translate research into policymaking processes, or to a lack of desire on the part of governments to listen to researchers on this matter. The participation of civil society in such conversations is also impeded by various issues, including a lack of technical knowledge and funding, and some governments’ perception that any external funding to such organisations could present a national security risk. Many civil society organisations view governments’ reluctance to share information as a form of opposition to stakeholder engagement, which complicates engagement even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, many government practices have set “negative norms” that stifle stakeholder engagement, especially internet shutdowns. Data shows that in 2022 alone, seven African governments shut down their internet nine times, four of which were during political protests. There has also been some targeting of particular social media platforms; this includes Uganda blocking Facebook in advance of a contentious general election, and Nigeria’s ban on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important challenge to developing shared understanding on RCB is that of the deep disparities among AU countries, whether historical, political or cultural. This is one reason why workshop participants partially believed that it is difficult for the AU to argue that it is speaking on behalf of the entire region or to assume there is a common “African” position on cybersecurity matters. Expert discussions revealed, however, that over the years, some technical and operational teams – for example, CERTs – have managed to foster cooperation through informal information-sharing channels, building elements of trust among themselves even when governments have not been responsive to such efforts. Workshop participants noted that the subregion of Central Africa has an advantage in this regard, as its regulations for digital financial systems, for example, are set by a central regulator. This means that no country can choose not to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing general conclusions across two markedly different “regions” is undoubtedly challenging, particularly when attempting to analyse them within a single study. The purpose of this chapter has been to identify key themes and questions for further research that can deepen understanding of how RCB manifests uniquely across regions and countries, rather than to present a definitive overview of RCB in the Middle East and Africa. The approach shifts the focus from “cyber norms”, which are primarily studied within Western-centric frameworks, to looking closely at examples from the Global South, where diverse practices, policies and institutions have been established to enhance cyber governance. Examining such practices provides important insights into how different actors may view (un)acceptable state behaviour in cyberspace, even if the concept of “responsibility” as such is not used. As highlighted in the chapter, regional (and subregional) bodies have an important role to play as enablers for the discussion on RCB – a discussion that they thereby hold on their own terms, focusing on topics such as development, combating cybercrime and protecting CNI, while also addressing important elements of UN commitments, such as international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as was emphasised in workshop discussions, one reason why many countries in Africa and the Middle East have been reluctant to participate in international norm processes is the institutional perception that the discussion on cyber issues has matured to a degree that any participation in agenda-setting would be considered a late arrival. It is becoming increasingly difficult for many governments to grapple with the speed of innovations and developments in technology, and discussions on responsibility may not, therefore, be seen as a priority. Currently, the political will for cooperation remains primarily focused on issues of peace and stability, rather than on RCB. Although it may seem that lack of resources is a key impediment to achieving progress on cyber governance in relation to responsibility, in many instances, countries have in fact been active on particular platforms on particular issues when such active engagement has been sought, in order to have a bigger impact. This means that at the heart of the problem could be dual issues of political will and of the structure of the incentives to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter has shown that, for many countries in the Middle East, RCB has been approached in terms of building the state’s cyber capabilities to protect national security, combat cybercrime and control the circulation of information online. Prospects for cooperation on cyber governance in the region are challenged by geopolitical rifts and intra-state conflicts. Looking at the GCC as a case study, the protection of CNI and information operations have been of particular importance to states’ cyber governance initiatives. Although the rivalry with Iran was once seen as a potential catalyst for rapprochement between GCC countries and Israel, the ongoing wars in the region complicate this endeavour and raise questions about the legitimacy of using automated weapons for targeting and surveillance as part of military operations – questions that have wider implications for global discussions on cybersecurity and the use of technology in warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa has witnessed a particularly active role played by subregional groups, such as ECOWAS, the EAC, the SADC and the ECCAS, in cybercrime legislation and instigating discussions on cyber responsibility. This has been especially focused on fostering the application of international law to cyberspace. Such subregional, rather than continental, forums for cooperation have overcome the challenges of harmonising policies among African countries with deeply rooted disparities, though those disparities have nevertheless impeded the AU’s ability to develop an “African” position on cyber matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future research and analysis should focus on the multiple areas where the roots of cooperation on responsibility in the AU and the GCC can be further developed, bearing in mind the importance of there being sufficient incentives for governments to cooperate. In addition to combating cybercrime and securing the digital economy, workshop discussions concluded that the responsibility of non-state actors is an issue where common understanding among governments could be improved. Several cyber attacks in the Middle East and Africa have been launched by non-state actors. In view of the political and security situation in the two regions, including the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and military coups against the democratic takeover of governments in Africa, regulating the work of non-state actors and debating their responsibility in cyberspace is a topic that governments are, most likely, open to engaging with. As such, this is an important area for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disinformation is another area that many governments in the two regions see as a priority in the field of technology governance. There is, therefore, an opportunity to use this topic to engage in multistakeholder conversations on localised approaches to content moderation, for example, that would also get social media companies on board. However, any such discussions should occur through an inclusive policy framework that includes civil society organisations in all state-led cyber governance initiatives, including through regular multistakeholder consultations. This also requires governments to refrain from punishing non-compliance with state-imposed frameworks and conceptualisations of security and privacy, and there must be more inclusion of individual rights in data protection and cybersecurity legislation and strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On cyber-related issues, Canada and the US are bound together by a broad range of institutions, values and common practices. Both states are founding members of NATO and part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing relationship with the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Forged in the wake of two world wars, these long-standing bonds both underpin and engender overlap in the North American approach to responsible cyber behaviour (RCB). This chapter was written before the start of the second Trump administration and thus does not reflect on policy shifts after December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the two allies diverge somewhat in how they realise RCB, as a production of either moderation or boldness. Fundamentally, Canada perceives responsibility as an extension of self-restraint; the US, by contrast, perceives it as a byproduct of its own positive actions and those of like-minded partners and allies. Bridging this divide and situating these approaches within a broader rubric of UN-agreed principles of RCB will likely require more explicit clarity from North American capitals. Meanwhile, major technology multinationals based in Canada and the US can act both independently of, and in concert with, their home countries, lending them structural and market influence over how “responsibility” is defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomatically, the US and Canada have advanced common cause on these issues internationally. Both have had delegations active in past sessions of the UN Group of Government Experts and Open-Ended Working Groups, and have worked in concert within the Organization of American States, the OSCE, the G7, ASEAN and others to implement the 11 voluntary, non-binding UN norms agreed by consensus in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even among otherwise adversarial states, in times of heightened geopolitical tension, the ability of Canada and the US to make progress towards the establishment of international cyber norms is noteworthy. However, such consensus-based, aspirational documents by design obscure the cultural values, operational considerations and institutional imperatives that tend to prevail at the national level – which sometimes override the aspirational policies and strategies concerning responsibility. In other words, particularly in the ephemeral domain of cyberspace, the so-called “say–do” gap can be wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gap also stems from the tendency to focus on detailing and curbing the objectionable behaviour of other states in cyberspace, while maintaining latitude and ambiguity in one’s own. The US and Canada have historically been vocal when it comes to calling out what they see as “unacceptable behaviour”, although the latter relatively less emphatically, through advisories, public attributions, sanctions, indictments and other punitive measures. However, this chapter examines how Canada and the US conceive of responsible behaviour beyond an external view of responsibility – that is, the responsibility of “other” states – and reflects on their own part. The disparities between domestic organisational instincts and diplomatic aims abroad are neither new nor exclusive to Canada and the US, but it is through exploring these dynamics that more understanding and progress might be achieved on developing, establishing and implementing RCB norms – both bilaterally and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on expert roundtable workshop discussions on both countries held in early 2024, this chapter begins by briefly discussing the evolution of these countries’ strategic cultures on cyber issues, including the pivotal historical inflection points that shaped them. Using journalistic, academic and civil society insights and analyses of these inflection points and major trends in the evolution of North American thinking on cyber writ large, the chapter then characterises the dominant philosophies and entities that manifest each country’s views of RCB. It then briefly touches on the unique and substantial role that the private sector plays in North American concepts of responsibility, and concludes with expert views on how to both clarify and harmonise these concepts with those agreed to under UN auspices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;canada&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada broadly conceives of RCB as a byproduct of diplomatic coalition-building and consensus, explicitly grounded in international law and philosophically rooted in states’ restraint. Relative to the US, Canadian officials have only recently adopted a more assertive stance on cyber issues, stemming in part from increasing cyber attacks, as well as from a desire to become more independently capable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until well into the previous decade, Canada’s cyber policy focus was primarily defensive – dedicated to protecting government systems from cyber espionage and helping its citizens to avoid becoming victims of cybercrime. From the early to mid-2010s, several events augured a more assertive Canadian stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013, for example, officials concluded that Canada was perhaps too heavily dependent on the US for digital intelligence and should become more independently capable of collecting its own. The following year, for the first time, Canada attributed a major cyber intrusion against its National Research Council to Chinese state-backed actors, elevating the threat of industrial cyber espionage in public discourse. Russian state-linked hack-and-leak operations against the US elections in 2016 and France in 2017 also galvanised policy attention in Canada, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government later signalled its intent to “assume a more assertive posture in the cyber domain”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2018, the most substantial national security reforms in a generation were working their way through the legislative process. Among the most sweeping changes envisioned were major investments in cybersecurity, and formally empowering the country’s signals intelligence agency, the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), to conduct offensive cyber operations, including “active defence” measures designed “to influence, interfere, degrade or disrupt the capabilities, intentions or activities of an adversary”. The legislation, Bill C-59, also enhanced the CSE’s ability to provide technical support to military and law enforcement agencies. A public-facing arm of the CSE, the Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity, was established to facilitate dialogue and exchange on these issues with businesses and the public. Canadian scholars subsequently explored the implications of this new assertive mandate in an attempt to square it with international law, the correct civil–military balance, and the necessary oversight. Military theorists, meanwhile, worked to develop capabilities and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2019, Canada created the Rapid Response Mechanism with other G7 countries to exchange insights and threat intelligence in response to cyber attacks. Despite a persistent focus on such multilateral efforts, “Canada appears to have had more success in bilateral and ad hoc initiatives or through working with its traditional security partners” on cyber issues, according to Carleton University professor Stephanie Carvin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even where Canada’s “active” cyber operations have been publicly avowed – such as those targeting unspecified foreign extremist or cyber-criminal groups – these more assertive measures are still couched largely in defensive terms. According to a Department of Defence spokesperson, “being assertive doesn’t just mean going on the offensive, but ensuring our networks, systems and applications are well protected. This is where our focus primarily lies”. This has not spared military and national security leaders from periodic criticism, however, to the effect that Canada’s cyber strategy remains “ad hoc”, lagging behind NATO allies, and too reliant on international norm-building to protect Canadian citizens and interests from persistent and growing cyberthreats. As some expert roundtable members and partners also noted, Canada’s strategic culture can be “aggression-averse”, and might reasonably be critiqued as “reactive” to national security threats in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, legislation makes it clear that cyber operations against foreign targets are to be an option of last resort, employed only when alternative tools are insufficient or untimely. In contrast to legislative oversight in the US, such operations fall squarely under the remit of the Cabinet as an executive function. Scholars note that insufficient oversight here may risk violating Canadians’ privacy rights. If conducted by the Canadian Armed Forces, offensive cyber operations are subject to the same strictures as any other use of force, requiring a Cabinet-level decision. Meanwhile, the minister of foreign affairs must accede to foreign cyber operations conducted by the CSE under its recently updated mandate. In strict keeping with international law, these operations cannot cause physical harm or impede traditional government functions such as law enforcement or democratic exercise. However, as Canadian analyst Alex Rudolph writes, “the risk in giving CSE the full capability set and mandate to conduct similar operations, even when tasked by the government, is that much of this will occur with minimal oversight or disclosure to the public”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative to the US, Canada has been more austere in issuing formal attributions for cyber intrusions and attacks, preferring to separate actors from behaviours, in the hope of depoliticising “responsibility”. As some workshop contributors noted, traditional notions of rules and responsibilities (often touted by the US as part of an international order it seeks to lead) are often perceived by smaller, less capable states as jingoistic, absent more content and context. Judging from publicly available insights, Canada’s gradually more assertive posture in cyberspace in recent years has been both austere and cautious, with deference to international law and multilateral progress on building norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us&quot;&gt;The US&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driven by both its dominant position as a cyber power and a defence and security culture that prioritises dominance, the US views “responsibility” as a byproduct of state-driven action, rather than of restraint. As it has historically done in other securitised domains, the US considers a preponderance of power to be linked with a duty to define – and enforce – the rules in otherwise ungoverned spaces. In practice, this has largely relegated RCB to diplomatic and theoretical discussions, while a strategy of “persistent engagement” in cyberspace prevails operationally. While concertedly engaged in and supportive of UN and other international frameworks, the US leaves sufficient rhetorical ambiguity in its approach to cyber norms to enable flexibility and assertiveness in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the birthplace of the internet and arguably the world’s first and foremost “cyber power”, the US has a long track record of theorising about state behaviour in cyberspace, and discussing it in multilateral forums. From the late 1980s through to the late 2000s, the US gradually adopted the view of cyberspace as a domain of competition and conflict, and cybersecurity as a core national security function. The discovery in 2010 of the Stuxnet worm – which the US and Israel had reportedly deployed to disrupt Iran’s nuclear programme – marked an inflection point in how states perceive conflict in cyberspace. It was the first major demonstration that destructive physical effects – rivalling those achievable with kinetic weapons, but with far more deniability – could be delivered digitally in pursuit of geopolitical objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in other areas of foreign and security policy, the US’s preponderance of technological, economic and military might informed Washington’s approach to governing an ungoverned space. President Barack Obama’s administration issued the country’s first International Strategy for Cyberspace in 2011, considered “the first government document worldwide to focus entirely on the international aspects of cyber issues”. Since then, the US has both engaged and expanded its cyber diplomacy at the UN and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the National Security Agency’s (NSA) already formidable intelligence-gathering capabilities in cyberspace, the world’s first cyber military combatant command, US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), was established in 2010. Its preliminary mission was to defend US military networks; beyond that, the command would “respond to cyber attacks under … military authority and would operate under standard rules of engagement. If the command need[ed] to work in a foreign country … it would need the authority of the U.S. combatant commander for that region with approval by the president”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ensuing decade proved consequential for how this approach would evolve. Most notably, unauthorised disclosures by Edward Snowden in 2013 sparked global scrutiny of US cyber-enabled espionage. North Korean hackers breached Sony Pictures Studios in California in 2014, prompting a national conversation about the extent to which the American private sector should depend on the US government for protection in cyberspace. In 2015, the White House secured Beijing’s (ultimately brief) restraint from conducting industrial espionage against American companies – including in cyberspace. Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election gave propaganda and information warfare parity with technical intrusions in terms of cyberthreat perceptions. By that time, Washington had become convinced that a purely defence posture of primarily military-related networks would be insufficient. By November 2016, USCYBERCOM had conducted its “most complex offensive cyber operation … to date”, against the Islamic State. As commercial entities and critical infrastructure operators suffered increasingly costly and disruptive cyber attacks in the years that followed, political pressures would grow to increase and enhance these measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift in philosophy – and thus a more expansive, assertive posture in cyber operations – would be codified in US strategy documents as “persistent engagement” and “defend forward” (PE/DF). These terms encapsulate the notion that the US would aim to neutralise cyberthreats at their source, prior to their manifestation in sensitive networks (publicly or privately operated). Cyber operations would be routinely conducted proactively, in grey, contested or adversary online spaces, “just as the US Navy keeps the peace by sailing the seas, or the US Air Force secures airspace by patrolling the skies”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, operations are not confined to military circles. In recent years, US law enforcement agencies have more aggressively pursued offensive cyber operations – with potential global reach – with an eye to pre-emptively disrupting threats. A range of mature US military, intelligence and criminal investigative authorities are now invoked to conduct offensive cyber operations. However, the mechanisms for deconflicting, formalising and clarifying the exercise of these authorities remain opaque, if not classified. The publicly acknowledged contours of National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 and the Vulnerabilities Equities Process – which broadly outline the inter-agency processes for coordinating military offensive cyber operations and handling the discovery of major software vulnerabilities, respectively – offer some insights. Still, a robust understanding of how officials delineate the limits of US RCB remains elusive. Moreover, some legal scholars have noted that non-military agencies, such as the FBI, have become more assertive in cyberspace – again with potentially global reach – but lack a clear legislative mandate and guidelines for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kurt Sanger, former Deputy General Counsel of USCYBERCOM, has been reported as saying that the utility of such capabilities “lies in enabling strategic effect without entitling the adversary to use force in self-defence, coupled with a unique ability to modulate the level of impact in a way that is not possible with kinetic operations”. The operational complexity required to strike this balance is matched by the complexity of doing so while adhering to international law and norms – the principles which the US acknowledges should prevail in cyberspace. Some cyber scholars and military theorists argue that this domain differs from “conventional environments, which poses a challenge to the relevance of these rules”. Indeed, while there is consensus that the law of armed conflict applies in cyberspace in times of war, a patchwork of treaties, case law and customary law leaves room for digital espionage and subversion – some of which, as in the case of elections, states consider escalatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this uncertainty – and the lack of conceptual clarity around whether cyber operations are an extension of warfare, intelligence or some other mode of statecraft – that raises questions about the degree to which PE/DF theory aligns, in practice, with RCB. However much coherence the concept might lend to Washington’s internal deliberations, it remains hotly debated among cyber conflict scholars whether the approach will actually constrain global competition in cyberspace, rather than intensify it. States may perceive (correctly or not) US PE/DF activities “not as a reasonable response to their own norm-busting behaviour, but as an escalation”, notes cyber scholar Jason Healey. The fact that the pre-eminent US military and intelligence-gathering organisations operating in cyberspace – USCYBERCOM and the NSA – fall under the same “dual-hatted” leadership might also complicate reliable signalling internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the foundation of those rules to which the US has agreed internationally – from the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime in 2001 to the framework of UN-developed cyber norms in 2015 and 2021 – a range of “interpretive questions” likely enable US officials to flexibly pursue PE/DF in a manner they deem responsible. For instance, the US has refrained from concrete stances or definitions on issues such as state sovereignty, countermeasures and non-intervention. The US has (sometimes grudgingly) become more publicly transparent about the policy processes guiding its offensive cyber operations. It is also willing to publicly define adversary behaviours as “irresponsible”. However, this have not translated into a more explicit delineation of what specific types of cyber activity constitute “responsible state behaviour”, and which do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expert contributors at the workshops ultimately assessed that the US has come to both implicitly and explicitly adopt the view that its own responsibility in cyberspace is defined more by commission than by restraint. In other words – with due deference to international law and guided by relevant norms – for those with the capability to act in service of a more secure cyberspace, their foremost responsibility is to do so. As a 2019 joint statement with like-minded states reads, “we will work together on a voluntary basis to hold states accountable when they act contrary to [the UN framework], including by taking measures that are transparent and consistent with international law. There must be consequences for bad behaviour in cyberspace”. In Washington’s view, responsible states must not only refrain from such behaviours, but also work together to punish them. In this regard, US diplomatic signalling on cyber issues has often functioned more as post hoc reprisal than as preventive remedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America’s diplomatic focus has, however, grown and progressed rapidly in recent years. In 2022, the US State Department established a standing bureau dedicated to cyberspace and digital policy more broadly – including a Senate-confirmed envoy to lead it, former US Marine Corps officer and technology executive Nathaniel Fick. The bureau’s remit is expansive, from bolstering technological expertise in the ranks to developing and implementing the US’s first International Cyberspace and Digital Policy Strategy. The latter, released in early 2024, sets out an ambitious and expansive agenda to make the digital ecosystem – including the hardware, software and physical infrastructure underpinning it – more secure, trusted and resilient. The strategy explicitly notes that success will be the product of “solidarity” among partnerships and coalitions sharing similar values – an evolution beyond the more “utopian” vision of a singular global internet of previous eras, implicitly acknowledging a more fractured global arena with competing models for development and security. Under this rubric, the Department of State aims to “organize and execute sustained diplomatic pressure campaigns to raise international and public awareness of significant cyberthreats and to increase the costs and risks to malicious cyber actors”, in conjunction with the operational efforts of inter-agency partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insofar as cyberspace remains ill-defined and ungoverned, the US seeks to define by doing, and to govern by superiority. Possessing both significant cyber capabilities and a host of digital dependencies – and with several revisionist adversaries to contend with – the US perceives itself as the pre-eminent cyber power. On the global stage, it considers its role both determinative and indispensable, as much by duty as by licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-the-private-sector&quot;&gt;The Role of the Private Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both Canada and the US, there is growing appreciation for the way in which commercial actors are able to shape cyberspace – for good or ill – at a speed, scope and scale that governments acting alone simply cannot match. Since many of the biggest multinational tech companies are based in North America, they enjoy some degree of autonomy in how they perceive and pursue RCB – often as consequentially as states themselves. With the US and Canadian governments and militaries depending on these same companies to develop and maintain technological solutions, both capitals and corporate boardrooms navigate a blurred line between regulatory and voluntary measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly since the Sony Pictures hack in 2014 by North Korean state actors, American and Canadian cyber strategists have pondered the degree to which commercial entities should depend on or expect protection from the state in cyberspace. In the interim, new legislative and regulatory initiatives in both countries have been aimed at shifting the onus of security from end users and consumers to developers and suppliers, and to operators of critical national infrastructure (CNI). Where prevention and deterrence have previously been the dominant themes of national strategy documents, these have come instead to emphasise resilience and security, both in supply chains and in the initial design of hardware and software programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly in the US – which is among the largest customers for technological goods and services in the world – officials have come to see governmental “purchasing power” as a way to incentivise more robust security in these offerings. As of 2023, both American and Canadian market regulators have cast corporate cybersecurity practices as being somewhat akin to the fiduciary obligations of publicly traded companies toward their shareholders. These steps have come on the heels of a number of recent intrusions into sensitive governmental and corporate systems by Russian and Chinese cyber actors in particular – including some which could be blamed as much on faulty or lax design choices and security protocols as on the sophistication of state-backed hackers. Even so, many commercial stakeholders are quick to point out that increasing concerns about liability and proprietary information can have a chilling effect on proactive tipping and information exchange with government cyber officials (Canada’s C-26 legislation attempts to assuage such confidentiality concerns).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, both North American countries view domestic and international standards-setting organisations as key to enhancing cybersecurity more broadly, and to ensuring open, interoperable internet protocols. These include the US Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology, as well as voluntary multilateral entities such as the International Organization for Standardization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the Internet Engineering Task Force, the International Telecommunication Union and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North America-based tech sector, in partnership with civil society, has similarly arrayed itself to lead against irresponsible behaviours in cyberspace. This positions these non-governmental, commercial actors to play a substantial role in defining “responsibility” on the international stage, whether through the very initial design of their widely used products, through advocacy and awareness campaigns, or through alignment with the national security interests of their predominantly Western, liberal democratic host states and user bases. For instance, initiatives such as the Charter of Trust, the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, the Cybersecurity Tech Accord and the Global Cyber Alliance aim to forge consensus and galvanise private sector action against cyberthreats – in addition to and beyond that which governments can achieve alone. Many of these same commercial entities have also joined government-led initiatives such as the international Counter Ransomware Initiative of President Joe Biden’s administration, and have joined the US and Canada as signatories to the UK-led Pall Mall Declaration against the proliferation of commercial spyware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, workshop participants noted that the “private sector” is not a monolith – hence a recognition of the need not just for symbolic declarations about making cyberspace safe for everyone, but also for institutionalising the rubric that “those with the most capability must shoulder the most responsibility”, particularly when it involves CNI and key resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patchwork of voluntary, collaborative and enforced cybersecurity measures is aimed at pushing the boundaries of private and commercial capacity to withstand illicit state activity. Even so, North American leaders have retained a clear monopoly on certain kinds of operations. For instance, commentators and officials have periodically proposed – while legislators have ultimately resisted – calls to relax restrictions on otherwise illegal vigilantism by private citizens or commercial actors. Canada and the US appear to have concluded that such “hack-back” or “deputisation” proposals ultimately entail more escalatory and normative risks than they do benefits to global cybersecurity. Meanwhile, the more recent proliferation of so-called “hacktivists” amid Russia’s war in Ukraine – as well as the influx of Western commercial support to Kyiv – has reinvigorated debates about states’ responsibility for hackers operating in their territory, as well as about what behaviours might qualify an individual citizen or corporation as a “combatant” in cyberspace during wartime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;clarifying-responsibility&quot;&gt;Clarifying “Responsibility”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expert roundtable participants broadly agreed that North American leaders are likely to maintain some ambiguity in their definition of “responsibility” in cyberspace. This lack of clarity will limit the efficacy of international norms. In the US in particular, more explicit clarity about how the PE/DF strategy is intended to align with the principles of RCB may be necessary. As operations conducted under this rubric are often cast as norm-building exercises, more can be done to clearly distinguish them from the types of irresponsible – as opposed to merely objectionable – cyber activities of adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, with the barriers to entry lower than ever for non-state and commercial actors to engage in cyber operations, the margins for third-party contractors and commercial proxies will only widen. Hence more explicit delineation may be needed, as North America is a leading target of state-backed cyber operations. Expert roundtable participants Richard Harknett and John Bruce (American and Canadian scholars, respectively) thus propose that North American leaders draw on a schema of “awful, (un)lawful, and (ir)responsible” when assessing or addressing state behaviours in cyberspace – including their own. These criteria could encompass a broader range of activities conducted using ICTs, including information operations on social media, non-state hacktivism and illicit surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are areas where additional research and policy recommendations will be necessary to guide state activities, set public expectations and signal to allies, partners and adversaries, particularly as cloud-based exploitation and pre-positioning – which have gained salience as US officials have addressed the presence of Russian spies moving laterally within cloud services, and the problem of Chinese malware in US critical infrastructure – fit within this rubric. Such specificity will help to solidify international norms, harmonise threat perceptions and justify response measures, even as the threat environment evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the approaches to RCB of the US and Canada are consequential in their own right – the former as the putatively dominant cyber power, the latter as a close ally, and as both part of major transatlantic institutions such as NATO and the Five Eyes. To bridge gaps within and beyond the North American region, workshop participants therefore recommended a more harmonised approach to digital privacy, a focus on anti-trust measures to yield more cybersecurity from market competition, and increased “safe harbour” measures to elicit good-faith efforts from private industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this compendium has demonstrated, there is a diversity of approaches, views and experiences that reflect how different states see responsible cyber behaviour (RCB). The compendium does not seek to be exhaustive; rather, it offers region-based reflections on how states have engaged with RCB as a concept. Case studies in this publication offer concrete examples of how incidents, institutions and policies can help us investigate RCB beyond the UN framework. The case studies identify unique characteristics defining RCB contextually, in terms of development, climate, content control, business development and offensive cyber capabilities, among others. Altogether, the compendium provides a complex yet enriching future agenda for research on RCB at the intersection between the international, domestic and operational notions of responsibility. The compendium makes at least two important contributions to the advancement of the study of responsibility in cyberspace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It explores perspectives that have been overlooked in international discussions, by reflecting on the cultural drivers and gaps in the interpretation of “responsibility” in cyberspace. For example, the Indo-Pacific region emphasises sustainable and inclusive capacity-building, and how cyber capacity-building (CCB) should consider the context of climate change. In the Middle East and Africa, on the other hand, it seems that responsibility is much more closely tied to combating cybercrime by non-state actors, the role of civil society in holding governments accountable, and concerns with development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compendium offers a practice-driven discussion of behaviours perceived as responsible or irresponsible, acceptable or unacceptable, by different governments. For example, European states emphasise political responsibility and public attributions to strengthen accountability, while North American countries, particularly the US, adopt a strategy of “persistent engagement” and “defend forward” to neutralise cyberthreats at their source, in addition to public or joint attributions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enacting-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;Enacting Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this compendium shows, RCB can be demonstrated in different ways. Despite regional differences, the compendium highlights some key methods through which states have sought to enact, showcase or indicate what RCB is, domestically and regionally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutions:&lt;/strong&gt; It is clear from the case studies that institutional development can be seen as a country’s attempt to confer certain roles and responsibilities regarding cyber security onto a specific body (new or existing). This does not presumptively mean that a state is considered a responsible actor merely by the fact that it has, for example, cyber security authorities or bodies in charge of conducting defensive or offensive cyber operations. Rather, it illustrates that, for some regions, the move to include cyber security as part of a specific institutional design might signal states’ collective commitment to addressing RCB as part of their agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laws and regulations:&lt;/strong&gt; As a key instrument of statecraft, laws and regulations are the bedrock of RCB enactment. They determine the roles and responsibilities for governmental and non-governmental entities working on cyber issues, and they set standards and requirements for baseline cyber security domestically, among other things. For example, the AU’s Malabo Convention serves as a basis for instigating discussions on RCB, reaffirming commitments to international human rights conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speeches and official statements:&lt;/strong&gt; States frequently issue statements to signal what they perceive as acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. As the Europe chapter shows most thoroughly (but is also observable in other chapters), public attribution and joint statements are some of the activities that states undertake to call out malicious cyber activity originating from or associated with another state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperation agreements:&lt;/strong&gt; RCB is also enacted through bilateral and cross-regional agreements and cooperation on CCB. ASEAN’s adoption of the UN norms to enhance trust and confidence in cyberspace, and the AU’s common position on the applicability of international law in cyberspace, exemplify regional cooperation in establishing common standards and perceptions for RCB, as well as joint commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drivers-of-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;Drivers of Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other factors that might drive a state to use these tools to consolidate and/or project RCB. The compendium touches on the following drivers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate change concerns:&lt;/strong&gt; The Indo-Pacific region’s emphasis on sustainable capacity-building reflects the intersection of cyber security with environmental and climate security priorities. Because of their immediate exposure to climate change, Pacific Island countries have advocated for more sustainable cyber capacity-building efforts, pushing donors to be more empathetic about their development and security needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existing geopolitical tensions:&lt;/strong&gt; Geopolitical rivalries across most of the regions surveyed have been a key driver of the creation of like-minded or minilateral environments for RCB discussions. In the cases of India and Pakistan, cyberspace targeting follows offline tensions – as with many other countries. European countries, the US, Canada and other “allies” have seen joint attributions as a main way of framing who the key threat actors are, and to which countries or regions they are linked. For others, mere proximity to major cyber powers – as in the cases of Indo-Pacific countries in relation to China – can have the opposite effect, with geopolitical tensions making countries more cautious and reluctant to attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The capacity to name and shame:&lt;/strong&gt; European states’ practice of public attributions serves as a mechanism for indicating what states view as irresponsible and unacceptable behaviour, and for shaming malicious cyber actors. It remains an open question whether malicious cyber activity can be deterred through public attributions, but the practice is effective in cases where states are seeking to highlight a lack of accountability from other states. While this compendium features mostly public attributions, the capacity to conduct technical non-public attribution is another key aspect of a state’s domestic responsibility to know about and act on information regarding malicious cyber activity originating in its territory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pressure to respond to large-scale incidents:&lt;/strong&gt; Driven by the need to address significant cyberthreats, Latin American and Caribbean states have shifted from a largely reactive to a proactive response to cyber incidents. Cyber incidents in Costa Rica and Colombia have shown how large-scale incidents, especially ransomware, have propelled states in the region to strengthen their posture in relation to domestic and operational responsibility, through passing legislation, developing proposals for national cyber-security agencies, and CCB.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing and maturing a national position on RCB:&lt;/strong&gt; The case studies in this compendium show a range of ways in which states have matured their views on RCB. Canada’s evolution from a defensive to a more assertive cyber policy highlights the importance of developing a clear national stance on cyber issues domestically. More traditionally, one of the key ways of signalling RCB is through the publication of national positions or statements on the applicability of international law in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business and sustainable development continuity:&lt;/strong&gt; Securing the digital economy, particularly in Africa, underscores the role of cyber security in supporting economic stability and growth. This is a much under-represented dimension of RCB, yet a cross-cutting one in relation to countries in regions including the Asia-Pacific, LAC and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlling the information space:&lt;/strong&gt; The intersections between RCB and information flows are clear from a variety of state behaviours. These range from Middle Eastern states’ use of cyber-intrusive tools to Indo-Pacific states’ support of content-related crimes such as disinformation and online hate, to European countries seeking to develop standards of behaviour in cyberspace through regulatory approaches to online platforms’ content moderation. On the one hand sits the need to control information, while on the other is, the need to ensure that online platforms are more accountable and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-reflections-and-the-future-agenda-for-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;Key Reflections and the Future Agenda for Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While all UN member states have agreed to the RCB framework, connecting it to the domestic level remains a challenge. This is particularly the case with the development of national positions on how international law applies to cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than seeking one definition, the research and debate about RCB can be richly investigated through a more culturally sensitive understanding of the drivers and means through which states seek to consolidate and project notions of responsibility. In some ways, this compendium shows that despite international commitments (and questions concerning their adequate observance), “responsibility” is what states make of it domestically and how they negotiate it, relationally and interdependently, with other states – that is, at the UN or through joint statements (for example, on international law or joint attributions).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compendium underscores the importance of understanding regional perspectives and practices in shaping global norms and expectations. By recognising the unique contexts and priorities of different regions – as well as not taking regions as coherent, cohesive or monolithic units of analysis – it contributes to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of RCB on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The role of silence or non-public statements remains under-studied. Publishing statements can be framed as an accountability and transparency measure for states. However, there are multiple reasons why states decide not to be more public about their views on RCB. These can be linked to a lack of capacity (human or economic) to produce documents such as national cyber-security strategies, a lack of political prioritisation and funding, a less public approach to cyber attribution and deterrence (for example, rapprochement), or a broader political strategy of not publicly disclosing thresholds for certain types of cyber operations or activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, while RCB is a term that encompasses responsibility beyond governments, the compendium reflects a cross-regional structure and thus a still somewhat state-centric view of responsibility. Future research on RCB should also consider what the term means for private companies working in cyber security, reflecting on how existing international commitments from these companies concerning corporate social responsibility practices and/ or joint statements (from business associations) and initiatives (for example, Tech Accord) illustrate how companies – and non-state actors more broadly – have sought to signal and engage in RCB.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the battlefield I did not see a single Ukrainian soldier. Only drones. I saw them [Ukrainian soldiers] only when I surrendered. Only drones, and there are lots and lots of them. Guys, don’t come. It’s a drone war. — &lt;strong&gt;Surrendered Russian soldier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines how Ukraine is advancing AI-driven unmanned systems to reduce direct warfighter involvement while enhancing combat effectiveness. Although fully autonomous warfare remains an aspiration, significant progress has already been made in partial autonomy—particularly for aerial systems—while human oversight remains critical in engagement decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ukrainian military’s objective is to remove warfighters from direct combat and replace them with autonomous unmanned systems.&lt;/strong&gt; This goal reflects the need to conserve a limited human force and overcome vulnerabilities such as fatigue, stress, and the limited capacity to process and fuse large amounts of data from various sources and sensors. Although not yet formalized into a written strategy, this vision unifies Ukraine’s military and defense industry around the adoption, acquisition, and rapid deployment of advanced technologies—including AI-enabled capabilities—and the expansion of unmanned systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomy—defined by the U.S. military as a system’s ability to accomplish goals independently or with minimal supervision in complex and unpredictable environments—is not yet present on the battlefield in the war in Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; The primary reason for this is that the necessary technology—AI in particular—has not reached the required level of development. Additionally, Ukraine has no formal legislative or policy definition for “autonomy” or “autonomous weapons systems.” As a result, the Ukrainian military uses the term “autonomous systems” interchangeably with “unmanned systems,” or platforms equipped with basic autonomous functions such as navigation or targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current deployment of AI is partial in scope, enhancing certain functions and addressing some operational challenges rather than enabling full system autonomy.&lt;/strong&gt; AI is a foundational technology for transitioning from automated to autonomous systems, or systems that can decide how to achieve a goal rather than merely execute human-programmed algorithms. AI significantly enhances specific functions, such as drone footage analysis and target recognition, target tracking, and autonomous navigation, including last-mile navigation and sound and text analysis for intelligence extraction, where AI replaces 99 percent of human labor. While such systems may operate without direct human control, they typically do not perform the entire process of finding, selecting, and engaging targets independently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian forces have widely adopted small and medium first-person-view (FPV) drones as platforms that may be quickly adapted for diverse missions through modular design and interchangeable equipment.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike the United States, Ukraine categorizes drones based on structural configuration, payload capacity, and propeller diameter. Initially, 7 inch FPV drones were common due to their ease of assembly, but growing operational demands have shifted preferences toward 9–10 inch quadcopters capable of carrying heavier payloads and achieving longer ranges. Adding an improvised explosive device (IED), an IED release mechanism, various sensors, or signal relaying equipment to the same FPV platform can transform it into a kamikaze drone; a bomber; an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) system; or a relay node. This modular approach, which allows for quick adaptation to diverse missions by swapping components, makes FPV drones a flexible and scalable asset on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine’s defense industry is developing standalone AI-driven software that can be integrated across various platforms to expand battlefield autonomy.&lt;/strong&gt; This software enables key autonomous functions such as environmental perception, target recognition, and navigation, including last-mile approach to the target. It comes in standalone modules, consisting of compact chips with embedded software and sometimes cameras. These modules can be integrated into a range of platforms, from small FPV drones and long-range-strike drones to turrets mounted on unmanned ground vehicles. As a result, companies are focusing on developing separate autonomous functions while ensuring their compatibility across multiple platforms and unmanned systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ukrainian defense industry is pursuing an approach of training small AI models on small datasets rather than developing large, all-encompassing models.&lt;/strong&gt; This approach enables fast and efficient onboard processing on the limited computing power of small and inexpensive chips, which can be quickly updated, retrained, and upgraded to adapt to changing battlefield conditions. These datasets can be collected through a company’s battlefield operations or open-source data from social media. Military authorities can filter out highly relevant datasets from the Ministry of Defence’s broader military dataset and allow companies to train their models in a protected military environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegating target recognition to AI-enabled automatic target recognition (ATR) systems onboard unmanned platforms reduces human limitations and allows locking on to targets up to 2 km away.&lt;/strong&gt; By automating equipment identification and object detection, drones ease the burden on frontline personnel affected by fatigue, stress, or skill variability. Advancements have extended target recognition ranges from 300 meters to an average of 1 km in combat and to up to 2 km in optimal conditions. AI-powered software also counters decoys and camouflage, which can deceive the human eye. As adversaries refine their evasion tactics, AI-enabled ATR models require continuous, real-world data updates to maintain accuracy and adapt to evolving battlefield conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomous navigation makes drones strikes three to four times more likely to succeed.&lt;/strong&gt; By removing the need for constant manual control and stable communications—both of which are vulnerable to electronic warfare and lack of operator skills—drones enabled with autonomous navigation raise the target engagement success rate from around 10 to 20 percent to around 70 to 80 percent. Although the striking precision is not very high, when Ukrainian forces expect it to be in “reasonable radius” rather than a specific point on a target, autonomous navigation reduces demand on the skill level of the operator and makes weapons systems with AI-enabled navigation accessible to a larger number of warfighters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The adoption of drones equipped with AI-enabled autonomous navigation capabilities is driving a marked decrease in overall strike costs by minimizing both drone losses and repeated mission attempts.&lt;/strong&gt; As a result of more efficient mission execution, these systems can often achieve objectives using just one or two drones per target rather than eight or nine. Furthermore, the integration of fully autonomous flight—from takeoff through mission execution to landing—makes systems reusable and reduces the need for frequent equipment replenishment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian engineers are increasingly leveraging open-source technologies and existing computer vision models to accelerate research and development while keeping costs low.&lt;/strong&gt; By integrating readily available software solutions—including open-source computer vision frameworks—developers can rapidly create and deploy autonomous functions. This approach is particularly advantageous for “attritable,” or expendable, platforms, where the benefits of minimizing both per-unit and development costs often outweigh those of highly customized solutions. Additionally, open-source components facilitate faster prototyping, ongoing updates, and a collaborative development environment that draws on global research—all of which help maintain an agile edge in modern conflict scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encrypting onboard AI software enables Ukraine to preserve its technological edge by making autonomous systems difficult to reverse engineer.&lt;/strong&gt; Although adversaries can replicate hardware designs in a matter of weeks, sophisticated encryption in AI-enabled software significantly slows down their efforts to develop equivalent systems. This secure software advantage allows Ukrainian forces to maintain a lead in drone autonomy. By investing in robust encryption protocols, Ukraine not only shields its critical algorithms and data but also establishes a strategic deterrent against immediate duplication, reinforcing the enduring value of high-tech innovation in modern warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training to operate unmanned systems equipped with autonomous features can now be completed in as little as 30 minutes to one day, substantially broadening access to these weapons systems.&lt;/strong&gt; What once required extensive flight hours now requires only a few hours, enabling a wider pool of soldiers to develop the necessary skills with minimal specialized expertise. As self-guided systems become more prevalent, drone training programs increasingly integrate autonomous targeting and navigation into their curricula. Recognizing this shift, institutions that educate drone operators equip learners to handle both manual and AI-assisted functionalities, often mastering autonomous modes in under a day. This accelerated learning curve expands the pool of qualified operators and bolsters overall operational readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian authorities are expediting the formal adoption and procurement of software and modules equipped with autonomous capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Key initiatives include codifying these autonomous modules in alignment with NATO standards and integrating them into official military service, which helps to scale acquisition. By classifying these modules as distinct components and establishing clear guidelines for their integration and use, the Ukrainian military is speeding up procurement and deployment timelines. In 2024, Ukrainian forces began purchasing 10,000 AI-enhanced drones—a preliminary yet significant step toward broader adoption of advanced autonomous systems. Although this figure represents only a fraction of the nearly 2 million drones built by Ukraine in 2024, it shows Ukraine’s growing commitment to increasingly autonomous and capable platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian military authorities increasingly require all unmanned and reconnaissance systems to integrate with situational awareness and fire-correction platforms, aiming to establish a common operating picture in real time.&lt;/strong&gt; To meet this demand, manufacturers must ensure their systems can feed data seamlessly into shared situational awareness and command and control environments. Even foreign suppliers recognize this imperative. For instance, Skydio’s drones are linked with the Ministry of Defence’s Delta system. The same may be said of the Ukrainian acoustic reconnaissance system Zvook and the text analysis tool Griselda, which provides intelligence from group chats and intercepted Russian communications. By unifying these capabilities, Ukrainian forces create a comprehensive, real-time operational picture that spans domestic and international technology providers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two major challenges lie ahead for AI-enabled autonomy: extending these capabilities to ground, sea, and undersea platforms and enabling swarming for aerial systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Although aerial drones have led the way in autonomous operations, adapting similar functionalities for multidomain use requires overcoming more complex technical and environmental hurdles. While the potential for integrating autonomous navigation into ground systems is significant, practical implementation remains largely unexplored by Ukrainian defense companies. In the aerial domain, swarming is currently in a stage of small-scale experiments; however, fully realized swarms—where drones communicate, make decisions, and adapt in concert—have yet to be developed. Achieving such sophisticated coordination will demand substantial advancements in AI algorithms, communication protocols, and real-time decisionmaking capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human oversight remains pivotal—particularly for engagement decisions—reflecting a human-in-the-loop approach that could shift toward higher-level supervision in the future while still maintaining human control of the system.&lt;/strong&gt; Although Ukrainian forces aim to expand autonomy wherever it can enhance operational effectiveness, engagement decisions remain squarely in the human domain. Current human-in-the-loop practices allow operators to override autonomous functions, ensuring critical ethical and strategic judgments remain under human control. This approach lays a foundation for broader autonomy in the future—but with sustained human involvement at pivotal junctures where the stakes are highest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To what extent are modern unmanned systems truly autonomous, and how significantly does AI enhance their autonomy in the war in Ukraine? What are the paths for transforming military unmanned systems from ambitious theoretical concepts into practical, AI-enabled battlefield tools? What technological, operational, and strategic barriers still prevent the realization of fully autonomous warfare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper explores these questions by analyzing Ukraine’s innovative deployment of unmanned systems and assessing the role of AI in enhancing their effectiveness in contested environments. Drawing on dozens of interviews with Ukrainian military officials and Ukrainian and U.S. defense technology manufacturers, this analysis begins by reviewing the Ukrainian military’s broader vision of military strategy and technology development. It clarifies the main definitions related to autonomy and autonomous weapons systems (AWSs) and then outlines the Ukrainian military’s long- and short-term perspectives on the future battlefield, though these views have not yet been formalized into an official strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on insights from these interviews and acknowledging that current technology cannot yet support fully autonomous missions, this paper describes advancements in three essential functions—intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); automatic target recognition (ATR); and autonomous navigation—showing how these developments steer the battlefield toward greater AI-enabled autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each section identifies the main challenges AI aims to address, explains AI’s role in overcoming these challenges, and provides case studies that illustrate AI’s practical application in context. Additionally, the paper provides an overview of key lessons learned and emerging trends within each function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to begin by clarifying how digitization, autonomy, and AWSs are defined, particularly given that different actors—including the Ukrainian and U.S. militaries—do not always use the same words to mean the same thing. Figure 1 illustrates how these definitions intersect and relate to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Relationship Between Digitization, Autonomy, and AWSs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digitization, as used here, denotes strategic adoption of advanced IT solutions, secure networks, and user‑friendly interfaces across the whole military ecosystem. This foundational infrastructure enables streamlined operations, improved decisionmaking, and a distinct strategic advantage on the modern battlefield. Although digitization is a foundation for all further technical advancements within the military sector, the focus of this paper is more narrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on digitization, autonomy in military contexts refers to the ability of a system to accomplish objectives independently or with minimal oversight in complex and unpredictable environments. AWSs represent a more specialized subset of autonomy. As defined by U.S. Department of Defense Directive 3000.09, an AWS is a system that, once activated, can select and engage targets without further human intervention. Thus, while digitization underpins the broader development of autonomy, autonomy ultimately paves the way for advanced applications such as AWSs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, however, no formal legislative or policy definition of either “autonomy” or “autonomous weapons system” currently exists. Often, Ukrainian sources use these terms interchangeably with unmanned platforms or platforms equipped with basic autonomous functions (e.g., navigation or targeting). While such systems may operate without direct human control, they frequently do not perform the entire process of finding, selecting, and engaging targets independently. Given this discrepancy, this study employs a broad concept of autonomy to examine AI applications rather than focusing exclusively on AWSs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ukrainian-militarys-central-goal-replace-humans-on-the-battlefield-with-autonomous-systems&quot;&gt;The Ukrainian Military’s Central Goal: Replace Humans on the Battlefield with Autonomous Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to technology, the Ukrainian military identifies removing warfighters from direct combat as its central objective in shaping the future battlefield. This goal is not simply an ambition; instead, it is an existential necessity for the Ukrainian armed forces. Given the substantial numerical superiority of Russian forces, Ukraine faces significant constraints on human capital, training resources, and time spent preparing warfighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, human personnel face inherent vulnerabilities, including fatigue, susceptibility to adverse weather conditions, and psychological stress. These human factors substantially impact operational sustainability and combat effectiveness, thereby reinforcing the tactical and strategic imperative for increased battlefield autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conversations with CSIS, a diverse group of Ukrainian military and industrial officials repeatedly shared this common vision, even though it has not yet been formalized with a written strategy. Instead, a broad consensus on this vision among commanders already guides the acquisition priorities, deployment of software (e.g., comprehensive situational awareness and fire correction), and integration of unmanned systems into forces and current operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;road-map-to-battlefield-transformation-ukraines-progressive-approach-to-ai-enabled-autonomy&quot;&gt;Road Map to Battlefield Transformation: Ukraine’s Progressive Approach to AI-Enabled Autonomy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic Component&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian military’s long-term strategy integrates AI‑enabled autonomous systems with real-time situational awareness as a pivotal step toward achieving its main objective. This approach aims to unify data from multiple sources, analyze it quickly with the help of AI, and maintain a real-time operating picture that every autonomous system can access, thereby sharing friendly and adversarial movements instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ukrainian forces currently envision a human-in-the-loop role, allowing operators to override AWSs when necessary, their long-term objective is to maximize autonomy across the battlefield whenever and wherever it supports improved operational effectiveness. This vision encompasses all functions, from intelligence gathering to progressing through the target life cycle, with human input limited to engagement decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, there is a significant gap between aspiration and reality in technology development. AI, in particular, has many issues that have slowed broader deployment. Ongoing technological limitations—from simple sensor malfunctions under harsh weather conditions to difficulties tracking fast-moving or camouflaged targets—force the Ukrainian defense industry and military to apply a gradual approach and take smaller steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a first step, the Ukrainian military focuses on adapting its command and control and integrating unmanned systems with conventional weapons systems into a single kill chain—for example, artillery. Kateryna Mykhalko, the director of Tech Force in UA, a Ukrainian defense manufacturers association, shared with CSIS that the envisioned single kill chain merges reconnaissance and strike unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with artillery in a unified command system. Rather than replace conventional artillery outright, Ukrainian forces employ smaller strike UAVs to execute precise attacks against smaller targets, which reconnaissance drones identify and track. These small attacks exhaust the defenses of bigger and more important targets, leaving them unprotected for a further, decisive artillery blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second step in the transition to fully autonomous military systems involves conducting and testing operations executed exclusively by unmanned platforms. The Ukrainian military has already begun operationally experimenting with this approach. In December 2024, Ukrainian forces took this step by carrying out the first fully unmanned operation near Lyptsi, a village north of Kharkiv. The attack involved dozens of uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) and first-person-view (FPV) drones, with no infantry participation. UGVs equipped with machine guns and munitions performed tasks such as mine clearance and direct fire. FPV drones supported the operation from the air, creating a coordinated multidomain assault. Following the attack, surviving robotic unmanned systems returned behind Ukrainian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tactical air-land operation successfully destroyed Russian positions and showcased Ukraine’s innovative approach to offset manpower limitations by leveraging attritable technologies. Although described as a “seminal moment” in conflict evolution, the robotic systems were still manually (though remotely) operated. Nevertheless, the operation brings Ukraine one step closer to implementing its vision of the future battlefield, which will increasingly utilize AI-enabled autonomous capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technological Component&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS conversations with Ukrainian warfighters and defense manufacturers reveal the organic approach that Ukraine and its domestic industry are taking toward achieving autonomy on the battlefield. Rather than follow a formal strategy, this process has evolved in response to several influences, including competitive pressures from the adversary, market dynamics, geopolitical considerations, and foreign export controls, especially China’s ban on the sale of key drone and microelectronic components to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technological evolution driving this transition may be divided into three key trends progressing in parallel. These trends result in systems that are not only flexible, cost-effective, and highly efficient but also adaptable to diverse mission requirements and equipped with AI-powered software that enables autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Trend 1: Ukrainian forces have widely adopted small FPV drones as a platform that can be quickly adapted for diverse missions through modular design.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small and medium Ukrainian-built FPV drones are the most commonly used platforms on the Ukrainian battlefield, aside from consumer off-the-shelf models like the Chinese-made DJI Mavic. While Ukrainian forces use these commercial drones, they cannot directly influence Mavic’s technology development. In contrast, local innovators produce and refine many FPV drones, making them the focus of this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian military classifies drones, including FPV drones, differently than the U.S. military. Instead of using categories like size, weight, or flight altitude, Ukraine groups drones by structural configuration (for example, quadcopter or fixed-wing), payload capacity, and, most importantly, propeller diameter. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022, FPV drones with a 7 inch propeller diameter were most common due to their ease of assembly, smaller batteries, and greater availability. Over time, though, increased demand for heavier payloads and longer flight range has led to a shift toward larger 9–10 inch quadcopters, which now dominate Ukrainian operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FPV drones have not only grown larger but also have become more versatile. As shown in Figure 2, a basic quadcopter platform may be adapted for different missions by adding or changing specific components. This modular approach allows the same platform to carry various payloads and fulfill different roles, making FPV drones a flexible solution across many types of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MjVfJMD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Types of FPV Drones Used for Various Missions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Trend 2: Ukraine’s defense industry is developing standalone software that can be integrated across a variety of platforms to incrementally expand battlefield autonomy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with the shift toward more advanced drone hardware, Ukraine’s defense industry is putting much effort into software engineering. This approach centers on creating modules—electronic and software components developed independently of any specific hardware platform. As shown in Figure 3, these modules often comprise a chip with embedded software (and sometimes a camera) and are usually smaller than a bar of soap. They enable critical autonomous functions, such as perceiving the environment, target recognition, and the capacity to engage targets without direct human flight control (so-called last-mile navigation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By focusing on one specialized function at a time and then offering that function as a standalone product, Ukrainian defense firms and startups can tailor their modules to operate across a broad range of systems. These include FPV drones of various sizes, ground vehicles, and even turret-mounted weapons. In doing so, they pave the way for broader autonomy, as each module contributes a distinct capability that can be integrated into larger multifunctional platforms. Examples of such modules and companies are provided in the case studies in the following sections of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8JiueSV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Examples of Modules Enabling Autonomous Capabilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Trend 3: Ukraine has prioritized scaling and localizing domestic drone production and increasing self-sufficiency.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a statement by Ukraine Minister of Defence Rustem Umerov, domestic drone production significantly expanded in 2024, reflecting Ukraine’s growing focus on scaling and localizing production capacity. In 2024, Ukrainian defense companies manufactured and assembled more than 1.5 million FPV drones. They also produced other advanced platforms, including strike quadcopter bombers, kamikaze drones, winged reconnaissance drones, and long-range deep-strike drones. Overall, Ukraine produced approximately 2 million drones in 2024. Notably, 96.2 percent of all UAVs that the Ukrainian armed forces used in 2024 were produced domestically, demonstrating the country’s increasing reliance on homegrown technology and localization of production components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has also introduced into its arsenal more than 200 domestically developed unmanned aerial systems and more than 40 ground robotic platforms since February 2022. Most of these new systems entered service in 2024, showing that local manufacturing is adapting to war conditions and establishing reliable supply chains. Specifically, 140 UAV complexes (designs and unique configurations) and 33 ground robotic systems were approved for operation in the first nine months of 2024 alone. Together, these developments indicate a strategic move to increase self-sufficiency, reduce supply chain risks, and ensure that the Ukrainian military can rapidly adapt to the evolving demands of modern warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Ukraine’s strategic emphasis on autonomy reflects its transformative vision for the future battlefield, where advanced AI-enabled unmanned systems will replace humans in direct combat to address manpower limitations and operational vulnerabilities. By integrating modular software development and scaling domestic production, Ukraine is not only adapting to the immediate challenges of war but also laying the groundwork for a future autonomous battlefield environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai-in-intelligence-surveillance-and-reconnaissance&quot;&gt;AI in Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to CSIS discussions with the Ukrainian military, the battlefield in the war in Ukraine critically differs from prior full-scale conflicts. Key factors of this distinction include the unprecedented proliferation of sensors on the front line, the extensive deployment of unmanned systems, and the exponential increase in data sources and volumes. Combined with advanced technological capabilities for data processing and analysis, these elements form part of the autonomous operational paradigm. In this paradigm, real-time situational awareness will provide machines with the contextual understanding required to act effectively within the operational environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Delta system, as outlined in an earlier paper in this series, is a good example of how the Ukrainian military’s intelligence sources provide video, photo, acoustic, and text data streams in tens of terabytes daily. After being processed, the data go back to the front line, but this time in the form of detailed information on enemy locations, equipment, movements, and activities placed on a digital map and presented in a single operational picture on the phone or tablet of almost every unit commander and even warfighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-challenges-in-isr&quot;&gt;Current Challenges in ISR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously outlined, the envisioned future battlefield differs greatly from practical realities. In ISR, three primary factors hinder the realization of the Ukrainian military’s desired future autonomous operational paradigm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations in Human Processing Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Modern reconnaissance systems, particularly drones, generate large volumes of data at speeds that exceed human processing capabilities. Certain tasks—such as detecting small objects in high-altitude drone footage or interpreting faint acoustic signals—pose significant challenges to human analysts. Fatigue, decreased concentration, and slower work increase the risk of overlooking important information contained in the data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delays in Data Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; Manual data processing is inherently time-consuming, creating significant lags in intelligence dissemination and operational decisions. Achieving real-time responsiveness becomes nearly impossible under these circumstances, preventing the fast execution of missions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complexity of Synthesizing Multisource Data:&lt;/strong&gt; Combining and integrating insights from diverse sources, including imagery, signals, and other types of intelligence, presents an intricate puzzle for military analysts. Successful integration demands the alignment of various data streams into coherent predictions and actionable recommendations. This task is challenging in real war conditions, given that multiple teams or even different external companies are working to analyze incoming data streams.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-ai-can-address-the-challenges&quot;&gt;How AI Can Address the Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that these limitations may be overcome and data can be quickly processed into high-quality intelligence information. AI allows for handling massive amounts of multisource data in near-real time. Within a broad portfolio of AI-enabled capabilities, there are methods and systems that can help tackle each challenge, from detecting enemy equipment in drone footage to interpreting diverse formats of unstructured textual data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 provides a summary of the main data types, the tasks involved in processing them, and the AI-enabled techniques used for these purposes. A more detailed explanation of these techniques is provided in subsequent sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TOiqEm9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: ISR Sources and the Role of AI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagery and Video&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imagery and video data the Ukrainian military receives comprises a variety of pictures, video, and objects and comes in different formats and quality. Traditional overhead intelligence primarily relies on satellite imagery and has significantly advanced due to the proliferation of commercial sector technologies and services. These include open-source platforms such as Google Earth and low Earth orbit satellites offering high-resolution imagery from companies like Maxar Technologies, Planet Labs, and Capella Space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this traditional satellite imagery, Ukraine has recently gained access to two novel layers of overhead intelligence. Both layers are obtained through drones conducting ISR missions. The first layer is collected by high-altitude reconnaissance UAVs, which private Ukrainian companies started to produce after the 2014 Russian invasion of Donbas. They made high-altitude reconnaissance available to Ukrainian forces quite widely and quickly after the full-scale invasion of 2022. The second layer of imagery comes from short ISR missions conducted at low altitudes by commercial drones such as the DJI Mavic and by Ukrainian domestic ISR drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All satellite and drone footage needs processing, analysis, and labeling. Computer vision using machine learning lies at the core of many AI-driven video and photo analysis systems. It effectively addresses the challenge of detecting and classifying objects in visual data using deep learning algorithms. By identifying objects such as military equipment or weapons, these algorithms are the basis for additional tasks like object tracking and image captioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To handle the spatial and temporal nature of videos, two main types of neural networks are commonly employed: 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). CNNs work by analyzing patterns across space and time, capturing how an object or action evolves from one video frame to the next, whereas RNNs track and interpret sequential data, making them effective for tasks like recognizing specific movements or repetitive activities. These methods train machines to detect objects regardless of changing poses or angles, mirroring how humans recognize items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real-time processing complicates the task of object recognition, as it requires analyzing 30 or more frames per second. With each frame containing millions of pixels, the task becomes computationally very demanding, resulting in high costs for such video processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 1: AI-Assisted Drone Footage Analysis Conducted by Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first case study presents an example of how the Ukrainian military is using AI-enabled systems to extract as much useful information as possible with the limited resources available. A team of volunteers, which later evolved into the Avengers team within the Ministry of Defence’s Delta system project, began developing a video and imagery analysis platform at the outset of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. At that time, Russian military equipment was moving extensively across Ukrainian territory, creating an urgent need for the Ukrainian armed forces to track enemy movements and identify the types and locations of Russian equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this need, the Avengers team initially collected and annotated footage from stationary cameras along major roads and highways. Then they used the data to train AI models capable of recognizing various objects, determining geographic locations through metadata, and providing critical insights into Russian troop movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when Russian forces retreated from northern Ukraine, combat shifted to a more conventional battlefield. The free movement of Russian equipment ceased in most areas, rendering the stationary camera footage (and the models trained on it) less useful. The team began receiving and analyzing drone footage, which presented new challenges, such as varying perspectives, resolutions, and object sizes. Moreover, the amount of footage to be analyzed drastically increased. The Avengers team had to respond by changing its approach to focus on creating infrastructure for AI training, such as employing structured and labeled datasets, developing a secure testing environment for external AI-enabled tools development, and integrating with other products within the Delta ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a foundation for AI integration into the process of drone footage analysis, the Avengers team took the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standardizing Labeling Practices:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2022, no enterprise solution was capable of analyzing drone footage and classifying Russian equipment. This required the team to develop AI models to assist analysts with annotations. However, these models had to be trained on large, relevant datasets. Therefore, creating AI training datasets became the first step in preparing for the transition to AI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dataset labeling is a labor-intensive task that requires significant human effort. Because the Ministry of Defence lacked sufficient internal resources, diverse groups, including volunteers and private sector teams, supported its efforts in labeling data. To ensure consistency, the Avengers team introduced formalized labeling standards and protocols. These guidelines outlined parameters to consider during dataset labeling, such as resolution, seasonal variations, metadata, and other relevant factors.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As a result, the Avengers team created a “universal military data set,” which adhered to these formalized labeling guidelines, making the dataset consistent and standardized. This dataset is large enough to enable high accuracy in AI model performance and may be filtered to produce smaller, more specific datasets for various use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a Validation Dataset:&lt;/strong&gt; To benchmark AI model performance, the team created a separate validation dataset containing content that does not overlap with the universal military dataset. For instance, if a model is trained to detect a specific Russian tank, the validation dataset includes color variations and images of the tank camouflaged, hidden in the bush, or with an antidrone net. This approach allows the model to provide accurate assessments of false positives and improves the model’s overall reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing Small, Specialized AI Models:&lt;/strong&gt; Operational experience has demonstrated that smaller, specialized models can achieve much greater accuracy in analyzing drone footage than a single comprehensive AI model. Therefore, Avengers and external teams started to produce multiple smaller models, each tailored to specific data types (e.g., footage from particular drones and satellite imagery). This approach enhances accuracy and relevance for distinct operational scenarios, focusing primarily on the hardest cases for the human eye and human attention: small objects in low resolution and poor-quality footage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facilitating External AI Model Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Avengers allow vetted developers to train their models securely, using selected portions of the universal dataset without exposing sensitive data. For instance, a drone manufacturer can request footage from drones that match characteristics of its product, such as a particular flight altitude, camera type, or resolution requirement, and train its algorithm within the platform’s protected environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving Toward Autonomous Analysis of Real-Time Footage:&lt;/strong&gt; The platform integrates with a live-streaming system called VEZHA, which is part of the Delta ecosystem and is designed to analyze real-time drone footage. Although human operators still carry out most of the analytical tasks such as classifying and logging events, improvements in AI model performance and integration with the streaming service have led to a growing role for AI-assisted analysis. This analysis may be divided into two primary use cases:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Time Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; In this scenario, AI algorithms help prioritize videos based on the number and intensity of observable events, such as active combat or significant troop and equipment movement. Drone feeds from reconnaissance missions over relatively empty fields are deprioritized. VEZHA also enables multiple operators to watch the same stream simultaneously and jointly log detected events (e.g., tank positions, destroyed vehicles, and artillery strikes). These events are then connected to a digital map (e.g., via the Delta monitor) and supplemented with screenshots and details for broader situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postanalysis:&lt;/strong&gt; The VEZHA team only applies postanalysis to the most challenging cases, such as low-resolution or high-altitude footage. Because AI-assisted analysis consumes considerable computational resources, the system prioritizes difficult footage over videos that are inherently clearer, such as those captured by low-flying Mavic drones, in which objects are more easily visible to humans. As a result, automated detection resources are conserved for situations where they are most needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 2: Vector, an ISR Drone System&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum Systems, a drone technology firm based in Germany, the United States, and Australia—with a newly established facility in Kyiv—has been testing and supplying its systems to Ukraine since March 2022. What began as a small donation of a few Vector drone systems and a focus on training Ukrainian forces has rapidly evolved into a large-scale partnership, with more than 500 systems now deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum Systems’ Vector drones serve ISR functions in Ukrainian strike missions. Acting as agile spotters, they locate targets and transmit precise data to heavier strike drones such as the Ukrainian-made Nemesis. This synergy ensures efficient fire support and artillery corrections. Quantum Systems has tackled widespread Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming by employing optical navigation and advanced data links provided by Silvus interference avoidance software. The system enables autonomous scanning and switching to alternative frequencies when one is jammed, maintaining mission-critical communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of the Vector drone design is its modular architecture. Swappable nose cones and imaging systems allow customization depending on mission needs. Equipped with day-and-night Boson cameras and powered by onboard Nvidia Jetson Orin AI computers, these drones collect high-resolution imagery and process it in real time, even under GPS‑denied conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum Systems is deploying Receptor AI, an advanced software package that enables drones to autonomously perform target recognition. While still under development, these algorithms will be trained to recognize targets based on Ukrainian datasets, ensuring better adaptability to real-world combat settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite investing heavily in AI to enhance autonomy, Quantum Systems emphasizes keeping human operators in the loop. This human oversight, company representatives told CSIS, should ensure that ethical considerations, strategic objectives, and final decisionmaking remain under direct human control, even as the technology progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acoustic Reconnaissance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acoustic reconnaissance is the practice of using sound to gather intelligence and monitor environments. It is not a new concept. It has been employed in various forms for decades, from submarine sonar systems during World War II to early warning systems detecting aircraft or artillery fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the integration of AI has revolutionized this field by automating the classification and recognition of sounds with precision and speed. AI technology enables systems to process audio data in real time, making it possible to detect and differentiate sound patterns that are challenging to identify with human hearing alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI-driven acoustic reconnaissance relies on a set of techniques nearly identical to those used for video footage analysis. It uses advanced machine learning techniques and neural networks, such as CNNs and RNNs, to analyze audio signals. These neural networks are trained to extract features from sound waves and classify them accordingly. Tools like spectrogram analysis, enhanced by deep learning, allow systems to visualize and interpret acoustic signals, distinguishing between the sounds of drones, vehicles, footsteps, and even specific environmental noises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 3: Zvook, an Acoustic Reconnaissance System&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following case study of the acoustic reconnaissance system Zvook illustrates how such technologies are implemented in practice in Ukraine. Ukraine’s use of acoustic detection systems has significantly advanced not only ISR but also air defense capabilities. Zvook uses sound analysis to detect and identify aerial threats at lower altitudes, where radar is less effective. It employs high-quality microphones and curved acoustic mirrors to concentrate sound waves, and it uses a computer the size of a shoebox placed behind the dish to process the captured sounds. Currently, Zvook covers approximately 20,000 square km of Ukraine with its grid-like placement of acoustic sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to radar, these systems are cheaper, with each station costing around $500. They are also passive (i.e., they do not emit detectable signals) and are particularly effective against low-flying drones, with detection ranges of up to 4.8 km for drones and 6.9 km for cruise missiles. Zvook processes data quickly, with detections typically appearing in the Delta situational awareness system within 12 seconds. The rate of false positives is just 1.6 percent. The information shared inlcudes the type of target and its sound, location, and direction of movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI capabilities for Zvook’s acoustic analysis were introduced through collaboration with the Ukrainian tech startup Respeecher, which before the war was working on AI-generated voices for collaborations with Hollywood. Reespeecher’s AI algorithms, particularly those based on machine learning, analyze acoustic signals captured by sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, AI-powered analysis filters potential aerial threats from all other sounds, such as cars, birds, and people. Second, the AI system is trained to classify different types of aerial threats based on their unique sound signatures. For instance, it can distinguish between helicopters, cruise missiles, drones with gasoline engines, and turboprop aircraft using sound alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest generation of these acoustic sensors and AI models brings an innovative feature: the ability to detect the direction of the sound source, including the azimuth and elevation angle. This means that multiple sensors can now work in tandem, using the intersecting azimuth information from different locations to precisely determine the coordinates, course, and speed of the target. Essentially, this transforms the system into a passive acoustic radar, providing a new layer of detection that complements existing radar systems. The Zvook system’s effectiveness has led to the use of radar primarily in response to acoustic alerts. Many radar installations are by default turned off to avoid emissions, which might invite Russian attacks. Zvook allows Ukrainian radars to be turned on only in priority situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a new type of drone or other weapons system appears, the team needs about a week to collect a big enough dataset for AI model training to recognize its sound. After that, the software of acoustic stations is upgraded remotely so that all sensors can recognize the new type of threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Text Information Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian military receives text data in large volumes, primarily from three categories of sources: (1) intercepted communications of Russian forces converted to text, (2) chat messages used within the Ukrainian military for information exchange, and (3) reports submitted by civilians through chatbot applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handling text-based intelligence is another core area where AI excels. Natural language processing (NLP) and related machine learning approaches can sift through vast collections of messages, chats, and intercepted communications, extracting important insights. Techniques such as named entity recognition and topic modeling identify significant information—like names, locations, or critical events—and highlight patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. By rapidly cross-referencing multiple sources, these AI-driven systems bring geolocated information on a map, indicating the positions and movements of enemy equipment or forces. Consequently, these text-based sources of information serve as an additional layer of data that is equally valuable for enhancing real-time situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 4: ePPO, an Air Defense System&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ePPO is a mobile application that uses AI to collect and analyze reports from civilians about air threats, such as missiles and drones. To use the ePPO application, users must first verify their identity through the government’s Diia app. Once verified, they can report observed aerial threats by selecting the type of object—drone, missile, aircraft, or helicopter—and pressing a large red button to send the alert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI processes the data to estimate the most likely trajectory of the threats, predicting their direction and speed. According to Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Defence Kateryna Chernohorenko, the process ensures that within two to seven seconds the data is transmitted to a digital map, which is accessible to all air defense officers. In a social media post, the deputy minister highlighted that the system significantly enhances Ukrainian efforts to repel drone and missile attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unique feature of the app called “It’s coming your way” is a personalized warning to users if a threat is likely to impact their location. The warning is issued based on the AI-enabled data fusion and projection of flight trajectories. Within about 10 minutes of data collection, the AI delivers approximate coordinates of the threat’s movement to users, allowing them to take timely precautions. With more than 600,000 downloads and 200,000 active users contributing to this collective radar system, the ePPO app represents a significant advancement in leveraging crowdsourced data and AI to enhance air defense and protect civilians during the ongoing conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 5: Griselda, a Data Analysis Platform&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Griselda is an AI-driven system for processing unstructured data that may be customized for a wide range of uses. Griselda is sometimes described as Ukraine’s Palantir. In an interview with CSIS, the company’s founder, Oleksiy Teplukhin, shared two notable applications of this technology that use largely the same underlying methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first use case is analyzing group chats to derive actionable intelligence. At the beginning of Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, warfighters predominantly shared intelligence information through group chats or messenger platforms such as Signal. Although more advanced communication systems (e.g., Delta) and specialized military channels exist, basic platforms remain widely used even today. Certain channels receive thousands of messages daily, often containing unstructured and unstandardized battlefield reports—such as sightings of Russian equipment. But this high volume of fragmented data can overwhelm frontline warfighters, making it almost impossible to extract essential insights in time without a technical solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example addresses the management of Russian intercepted audio communications from multiple sources. Traditionally, processing such extensive audio datasets requires considerable human resources, including large-scale call centers staffed by numerous analysts responsible for transcription, comprehension, and extraction of relevant details. This approach is not only labor-intensive but also prone to errors, limiting its efficiency and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To overcome these challenges, Griselda, which partners with the Ukrainian military on both cases, automates processes with the help of AI. The system replaces human operators in critical functions such as transcription, semantic analysis, and identification of entities and key data points within the intercepted conversations. Moreover, the AI constructs ontological graphs, enabling pattern recognition and semantic connections across vast datasets. These graphs allow analysts to uncover insights and relationships that would be impossible for humans to discern manually. By automating these workflows, AI reduces the need for human labor by an estimated 99 percent, according to Teplukhin. Operationally, this breakthrough translates into markedly enhanced speed, accuracy, and effectiveness in processing intelligence information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, Griselda is integrated with Delta, which ensures that all intelligence insights are instantaneously disseminated throughout the chain of command. These insights are then visualized on a map, enabling seamless distribution to relevant personnel, including drone operators stationed in areas where suspicious activities have been detected. By directing their drones to the designated locations, these operators can validate the intelligence and gather additional details as necessary, thereby enhancing situational awareness and operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employing AI for preliminary data filtering and prioritization optimizes resources for real-time intelligence processing.&lt;/strong&gt; By automatically screening large volumes of incoming information—such as multiple video streams from reconnaissance drones—AI systems can highlight critical content that demands immediate attention. This approach helps analyst teams direct their limited bandwidth and processing power toward the most pertinent data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standardizing the curation and labeling of military datasets enhances efficiency and flexibility in AI model development.&lt;/strong&gt; Adopting consistent protocols for tagging and organizing incoming data—from drone feeds to satellite imagery—makes it easier to separate relevant parameters for different AI applications and filter out smaller datasets. Both military and private sector teams can collaborate in this effort, ensuring that well-structured datasets are readily available for specialized training and more accurate model deployment. Of note, most of this standardization occurs organically instead of, for example, being driven by some standardization committee or organization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building specialized smaller-scale AI models addresses specific operational challenges more effectively.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of relying on a single, all-encompassing model, smaller specialized AI models can be trained on targeted subsets of larger datasets for focused tasks. This approach not only enables more precise problem solving but also streamlines the model-training process, making solutions more adaptable to changing mission requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trends&quot;&gt;Trends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian military authorities are increasingly demanding the integration of all unmanned reconnaissance systems into situational awareness and fire-correction platforms.&lt;/strong&gt; The Ukrainian military expects manufacturers of unmanned ISR systems of any size and domain, whether designed for tactical or strategic operations, to feed relevant data into shared intelligence systems (e.g., Delta). This demand helps ensure all reconnaissance activities collectively contribute to a comprehensive real-time operational picture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ukrainian military is shifting toward AI-enabled real-time multisensor fusion to enhance situational awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; By integrating data from drone imagery, satellite photos, acoustic signals, and textual information, Ukrainian forces create a continuously updated operational picture. This shift increases the need for advanced data-fusion technologies, ensuring that AI tools rapidly extract insights from every source and merge them into a unified common operating picture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI systems are evolving beyond basic data analytics to provide commanders with actionable insights and strategic recommendations throughout the target engagement cycle.&lt;/strong&gt; Building on real-time intelligence assessments, these tools soon will not only highlight potential threats but also propose prioritized targets, identify gaps in available resources, and determine which assets are best suited to neutralize a given threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Military agencies are easing access to vetted datasets for external developers, providing an opportunity to keep their AI models accurate and relevant.&lt;/strong&gt; By allowing approved private companies and researchers to securely train or test AI models on government-provided data within secure environments, this approach significantly lowers the burden of data collection for companies. These efforts seek to develop a pool of advanced AI models better tailored to rapidly evolving operational needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-enabled real-time situational awareness provides the foundation for joint all-domain operations.&lt;/strong&gt; AI-enabled data fusion, integrating intelligence from land, air, sea, space, and cyberspace into one cohesive view, provides a foundation for synchronized actions across domains. It is also a basis for collaboration with allied partners in executing combined operations, allowing decisionmakers to quickly align resources, identify threats, and exploit tactical opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai-in-automatic-target-recognition&quot;&gt;AI in Automatic Target Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automatic target recognition (ATR) is a suite of technologies that automate the detection, classification, and tracking of objects or individuals. At its core, ATR relies on pattern recognition algorithms that match incoming sensor data against a set of known templates or behavioral models, flagging unusual features as potential targets. It is not a new concept to the military, but AI changes the way ATR works and the way ATR systems are developed, enabling enhanced performance and reducing costs that previously put such applications out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, ATR follows a three‑step process. First, an AI-enabled ATR system detects targets by scanning a designated area for any signs of interest, drawing on both visual and nonvisual sensor data. Once a target is detected, the system classifies it by identifying what it most likely represents—for example, a vehicle, a person, or a structure. Finally, the system tracks each identified target, continuously updating position information and projecting possible movements or changes in status. This continuous monitoring is particularly valuable in fast‑evolving tactical scenarios, as it gives warfighters on the ground up‑to‑the‑second insight into potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the role of ATR as a built-in feature of unmanned systems, demonstrating how onboard AI applications help bring these platforms closer to fully autonomous operations. In particular, target recognition plays a pivotal role in enabling future AWSs to independently select targets, though ATR is often incorporated into systems that do not meet the definition of an AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By automating target identification, ATR technology bolsters real-time decisionmaking—whether a human operator or the system itself executes those decisions. Its foundation in AI-based algorithms and sensor fusion also makes it highly adaptable to ever-shifting battlefield conditions and marks a significant leap in harnessing AI’s ability to process complex data efficiently, accurately, and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-challenges-in-atr&quot;&gt;Current Challenges in ATR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although ATR technology has become essential on the modern battlefield, it still faces significant limitations. While it performs well in controlled environments, its adaptability and precision diminish under the complex and dynamic conditions of a real war. The following are some key obstacles facing human‑operated drones equipped with ATR:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use of Decoys and Camouflage:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most pressing challenges for ATR lies in distinguishing between genuine threats and elaborate deceptions. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces frequently deploy decoys, such as inflatable tanks or false artillery installations, and advanced camouflage techniques, confounding target recognition algorithms and human operators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Warfare (EW) Interference:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to physical countermeasures, both sides employ robust EW systems designed to disrupt drone communications, sensor data feeds, and the broader chain of command. EW interference impairs real‑time data transfer, making it far more difficult for drones or their operators to reliably identify and confirm targets. As a result, ATR must operate in environments with degraded or intermittent communication links, handling target recognition and tracking tasks with onboard processing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dealing with low visibility and dense urban environments.&lt;/strong&gt; Natural and man-made factors—such as fog, rain, snow, and nighttime operations—can significantly reduce the effectiveness of standard optical and infrared sensors. In such scenarios, ATR may rely on alternative methods like radar or acoustic detection, which come with their own performance limitations. Urban settings in eastern Ukraine add another layer of complexity given the dense infrastructure. Highly sophisticated sensors and algorithms and well‑trained operators often get confused, but Ukrainian developers strive to maintain accurate targeting while minimizing collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-ai-can-address-the-challenges-1&quot;&gt;How AI Can Address the Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI offers significant advantages in the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of identifying and tracking targets in complex operational environments. The good news is that AI-enabled ATR software may be integrated directly onboard an unmanned system. By processing data within a localized, self-contained network, AI algorithms can fuse multiple sensor inputs to give warfighters an understanding of their surroundings and the target, even without live communication with base situational awareness systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of AI-enabled ATR is the ability to detect and classify targets more rapidly and accurately than human operators. Advanced machine learning algorithms, trained on datasets that include real-world combat scenarios, can distinguish among vehicles, human figures, and structures in various terrain and weather conditions. Operating continuously without fatigue, these systems pick up subtle distinctions that human observers might miss, enabling identification of decoys and camouflaged targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond mere detection, AI excels at rapidly prioritizing multiple targets based on real-time variables such as threat level, proximity to friendly forces, and mission objectives. Some Ukrainian AI-enabled ATR systems use the same techniques as described in the ISR section (convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) as well as other techniques such as reinforcement learning. However, in this case, the AI models are integrated into the unmanned system’s onboard software. With such capabilities, a drone can process massive amounts of sensor data and apply predictive models in real time during the mission. AI systems can determine and advise operators regarding which threats require immediate engagement. As a result, AI reduces the cognitive load on human operators while ensuring that vital decisions—such as which target to engage first—are made more rapidly and accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI-driven autonomy also increases resilience against enemy countermeasures, particularly those aimed at disrupting communication links and navigation systems. By shifting from human control to human oversight, AI-enabled platforms can maintain their targeting focus even if the operator’s signal is jammed or lost. Moreover, technologies like pixel lock can support high-precision tracking, allowing drones to maintain a lock on targets despite interruptions in operator communication—a critical benefit in environments subject to heavy EW interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning models fuel this resilience, allowing the system to learn from each operation and refine its responses over time. Through reinforcement learning and other adaptive techniques, AI can identify emerging adversary tactics and continuously improve a platform’s targeting accuracy. This iterative learning cycle helps drones stay effective in fast-changing combat conditions, ultimately minimizing operational downtime and preserving critical military assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these AI-based technologies are still in their early stages of deployment on Ukrainian battlefields—limited, for now, to basic object recognition and tracking rather than advanced predictive models or onboard recommendation systems—their use by Ukrainian warfighters continues to grow in both scale and sophistication. In parallel, military authorities are actively developing regulatory frameworks and operational procedures to facilitate and standardize (especially for procurement) the adoption of these emerging systems, thereby laying the groundwork for more sophisticated AI capabilities in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 6: ZIR, an Autonomy Kit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company ZIR Systemspecializes in developing software that can complement almost any type of strike drone. The key feature of the software and the reason it is called ZIR (which means “eyesight” in Ukrainian) is its ability to automatically detect targets. The system includes a hardware component—a compact module with a computer and a digital camera—and a software component, which in this case involves a pretrained AI model capable of identifying targets. This software also adds some autonomous navigation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardware module, approximately the size of a bar of soap, is designed for seamless integration across a variety of platforms, from quadcopters to aircraft. Presets exist for 7–10 inch standard quadcopter models. For fixed-wing drones, the company provides only essential wiring and components, leaving manufacturers to address weight balancing, camera placement, and other aspects of their product design. Although the hardware integration process may appear straightforward, each new drone still requires manual adjustments. Therefore, the overall process of integrating the ZIR kit can take from several weeks up to a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI-powered software, trained on open-source data, can identify various target types—including infantry, civilian automobiles, minivans, trucks, air defense systems, artillery, armored vehicles, and tanks. It automatically detects targets and locks on them from 1 km away and operates autonomously up to 3 km away, even in tough EW environments. With precision of roughly 90 cm, it can also engage moving targets traveling at speeds up to 64 km/h.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is pursuing the goal of full autonomy by developing a system that can independently fly and detect and engage targets. To advance this goal, the company employs ArduPilot, an open-source autopilot software for unmanned vehicles that supports autonomous navigation, waypoint planning, and real-time telemetry. Through ArduPilot, the system can operate without communication by uploading missions to locate and neutralize targets within a specified zone. Additionally, optical navigation replaces GPS in environments lacking satellite coverage, a capability tested and validated by a successful three-mile test range flight that returned to its starting point without GPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional key consideration for the company is the system’s ease of use and the speed at which operators can train to use it. To achieve this, the company continuously collects feedback from new pilots, identifying issues they encounter and addressing these areas for improvement. The company also provides both video and written instructions for its software and hardware usage and collaborates with drone schools by integrating the training for its system into their curriculum. Operators can learn the fundamental principles of targeting systems in a single day and enhance their proficiency with further practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 7: Skydio’s ATR Evolution from Consumer Tech to Battlefield AI&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview with CSIS, the Skydio team shared that their journey in Ukraine began with a critical weakness: Its older drone, the X2, operated on static frequencies, making them highly vulnerable to EW. Initially designed based on U.S. military procurement requirements from the early 2010s, these drones lacked frequency agility, as they were intended for environments like Iraq and Afghanistan, where EW challenges were minimal or absent. Consequently, when the war in Ukraine erupted in 2022, the drones struggled against Russian jamming. Just as the Skydio team had warned, EW led to communication failures, reduced operational range, and a damaged reputation among Ukrainian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determined to address these shortcomings, Skydio teams made over 30 visits to Ukraine between 2022 and 2024, which helped to incorporate insights from the battlefield into the development of the the X10D drone. While the drone can resist jamming, navigate without GPS, and integrate into various command and control systems, the X10D mainly addresses broader requirements from the commercial sector and for public safety. However, the focus in this case study is a breakthrough in ATR that became central to the drone’s effectiveness in ISR missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skydio’s ATR capabilities have evolved from simple object tracking—first developed for consumer drones in 2014—to a sophisticated detection system that uses deep learning. Initially used to track athletes in sports applications, the software was later adapted for military use. Today, Skydio’s deep learning and computer vision teams continuously refine these models, enhancing detection accuracy for both electro-optical and infrared imagery. The X10D now features the most advanced thermal camera in its class, providing radiometric infrared imaging, which allows operators to assess temperature variations, detect heat signatures, and determine whether, for example, a vehicle was recently active or has been abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATR capabilities are enhanced with Skydio’s focus visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The X10D drone is equipped with six ultra-wide-angle navigation cameras, covering more than 200 degrees each, allowing it to create a 3D map for obstacle avoidance. Initially, VIO was limited to flights below 30 m in altitude, as higher altitudes lacked sufficient visual features for stable navigation. However, by using improved traditional geometric computer vision techniques and leveraging a large amount of internal Skydio data, Skydio extended its GPS-denied navigation to 300 m in altitude, making it far more practical for tactical reconnaissance in both open battlefields and urban environments. This improvement has been crucial for urban warfare and ISR missions in dense cityscapes, where GPS signals are often unreliable due to EW or structural interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maximize its impact, Skydio has worked to integrate X10D drones into Ukraine’s command and control networks, including the Delta system, used by the military and other agencies’ systems. This integration allows sharing drone ISR feeds across multiple units, enhancing battlefield situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to these advancements, Skydio has shipped about a 1,000 drones to Ukraine, many of which are now deployed on the Ukrainian battlefield. They are primarily used for tactical ISR, helping to detect, track, and target enemy assets, including other drones, ground vehicles, and EW units. Their ability to resist jamming, navigate without GPS, and provide high-fidelity ATR data has significantly improved their effectiveness in combined drone and artillery strike operations, a key tactic in Ukraine’s evolving drone warfare strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned-1&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegating target recognition tasks to AI-enabled ATR systems onboard unmanned platforms has proved highly effective in reducing human-related limitations and enhancing mission outcomes.&lt;/strong&gt; By automating equipment identification and other object-detection processes, drones lessen the burden on frontline personnel, who might be hindered by fatigue, stress, or skill level. This shift allows operators to concentrate on more complex, high-level decisionmaking, ultimately improving operational efficiency and situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian drone manufacturers prioritize developing specialized autonomy features that can integrate with any unmanned platform.&lt;/strong&gt; These companies have developed their core business models around refining standalone autonomous capabilities, such as AI-enabled ATR. They aim to ensure seamless implementation across a variety of unmanned systems, thereby accelerating overall technological advancement in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian engineers leverage open-source technologies and existing computer vision models to accelerate research and development and make it more affordable.&lt;/strong&gt; By incorporating readily available software solutions, including open-source computer vision frameworks, developers can expedite the creation and deployment of ATR systems. This cost-effective strategy is particularly appealing for attritable or expendable platforms, where reduced unit and development costs outweigh the benefits of highly customized solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trends-1&quot;&gt;Trends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The proven efficiency of ATR-equipped systems drives the Ukrainian military to start procuring more drones with autonomous capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2024, recognizing the operational advantages of ATR, Ukrainian forces initiated the procurement of 10,000 drones featuring AI-enhanced autonomy—an early step toward broader adoption of advanced autonomous systems. Although this number remains a fraction of the nearly 2 million drones contracted in 2024, it signals a significant move toward more autonomous and capable platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipping drones with affordable onboard computers enables AI models to perform real-time target recognition.&lt;/strong&gt; By installing low-cost processors directly into drone hardware, Ukrainian forces can deploy compact AI modules capable of identifying targets without relying on extensive external processing. This approach reduces latency, conserves bandwidth, and provides greater operational flexibility, particularly in environments where connectivity or remote computing may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using AI training techniques that require smaller datasets simplifies target recognition for drone missions.&lt;/strong&gt; Training AI algorithms typically demands extensive high-quality data. However, newer models designed for smaller datasets allow for more rapid development and adaptation. This efficiency leads to quicker deployment of ATR functionalities, even when comprehensive training data for certain target types is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To address evolving countermeasures like decoys and camouflage, Ukrainian engineers make continuous model upgrades and frequently retrain on updated operational data.&lt;/strong&gt; As adversaries adopt innovative methods to evade detection, ATR models must be repeatedly refined with real-world data. Regular updates not only keep the AI current but also mitigate the risk of misidentification due to emerging tactics, ensuring consistent target recognition performance under varying battlefield conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A modular approach to ATR integration extends the technology’s applicability across a wide range of unmanned platforms.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, when turrets are equipped with ATR systems, their precision in targeting and firing increases significantly. These turrets, in turn, may be mounted on trucks or unmanned ground vehicles, broadening their operational use and enhancing overall mission versatility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai-in-autonomous-navigation&quot;&gt;AI in Autonomous Navigation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While impressive footage of drones striking fleeing Russian soldiers and estimates valuing destroyed equipment in the millions of dollars may captivate public attention, these visuals do not fully represent the complexities involved. Ukrainian operators on the front lines shared in interviews with CSIS that most small, low-cost FPV drone missions succeed only about 10 to 15 percent of the time, and even highly skilled operators typically reach only a 30 to 50 percent success rate. A last-mile navigation system can offer a significant boost to these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Ukrainian military, last-mile navigation specifically refers to the mechanism that guides the drone through its final approach once it is within visual range and the operator has confirmed the target. Although originally designed as an integrated feature, last-mile solutions are now procured as standalone systems that may be installed on various drone platforms. While their integration requires certain hardware upgrades—such as adding a compact computing chip or replacing analog cameras with digital ones—these modifications remain relatively simple, providing a flexible pathway toward more autonomous drone operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-challenges-in-autonomous-navigation&quot;&gt;Current Challenges in Autonomous Navigation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low success rate of drone strike missions reveals several critical challenges, which can be divided into four major issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Human Factor:&lt;/strong&gt; Operating FPV drones demands a specialized skill set that differs significantly from piloting consumer drones such as the DJI Mavic—often referred to in Ukrainian military circles as the “iPhone of drones” for its self-stabilization and automated flight functions. FPV drones require precise manual control of pitch, roll, yaw, and throttle, leaving little room for error.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This complexity is magnified by a range of operational stressors, including signal latency delays of two to three seconds, harsh weather conditions, and fast-moving, unpredictable targets. Drone operators must adapt quickly to these variables while facing the added pressure of battlefield threats, such as the risk of detection and counterattack. Combined, these factors considerably increase the likelihood of operator mistakes and the attractiveness of last-mile autonomous navigation. For example, if the target is on a fast-moving vehicle, the signal latency alone may mean that autonomous last-mile navigation (sometimes referred to as “terminal navigation”) is required for a successful strike.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; EW remains a constant threat to drone operations, with both Russian and Ukrainian forces deploying advanced jamming and spoofing techniques. Jamming specifically involves broadcasting high‑power electromagnetic energy over a particular frequency band—commonly used for radio control or GPS—to drown out legitimate signals, severing the communication link between a drone and its operator. Once the drone loses access to navigational or positional data, it becomes nearly impossible to steer or monitor unless it has alternative capabilities onboard.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On the Russian side, EW units employ two main strategies. The first consists of localized protection bubbles, a type of portable equipment that jams signals within a radius of roughly 200–300 m around high‑value assets, thwarting drones during their final approach. The second strategy, long‑range jamming, relies on large power generators and specialized equipment to project disruption across much larger areas. Although localized jamming affects only a confined zone, both methods pose formidable challenges for UAVs dependent on sustained operator remote control.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Notably, Ukraine’s EW efforts sometimes intensify these difficulties. According to Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi, the commander of Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces, friendly jamming in shared airspace frequently interferes with Ukrainian drones, creating additional layers of complexity for operators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radio Wave Physics:&lt;/strong&gt; The physical limitations of radio wave propagation present another challenge. The radio horizon, where terrain or obstacles such as hills and buildings interrupt signals, can isolate drones from their operators, leaving them stranded and unable to complete missions. Although relay systems can partially address this issue, they are not always available or reliable in the fast-changing and unpredictable conditions of the battlefield, further complicating effective navigation and final approach to the target.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engaging a Moving Target:&lt;/strong&gt; This issue is an especially challenging task and a unique skill for drone operators to master. When a drone chases a target from behind, the relative speed of its approach is reduced due to their simultaneous movement in the same direction, which gives an operator more time to react to changes in movement. In contrast, a head-on approach increases difficulty because both drone and target converge at high speed, limiting the window for flight path adjustments and often requiring some prediction. Lateral or perpendicular movements exacerbate the problem further, as an operator must constantly align with the target’s shifting position.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-ai-can-address-challenges&quot;&gt;How AI Can Address Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major step toward overcoming the challenges of battlefield drone operations is autonomous navigation, which leverages machine learning instead of using fixed, rule-based commands. By integrating advanced AI algorithms and sensor suites directly onto the drone, these platforms can make instantaneous decisions about flight paths, localization, and obstacle avoidance independently of a constant operator feed. In essence, the drone constructs an evolving picture of its environment using machine vision and deep learning algorithms, enabling it to map surroundings, pinpoint its location without GPS, and dynamically chart a course around unforeseen hazards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition to autonomous flight becomes most critical once a target is identified, whether via ATR or manual operator input. At this stage, a last-mile guidance system assumes direct control over flight, charting a final approach and engagement path. By relying on real-time sensor inputs, the drone adjusts for variables like wind gusts, shifting terrain, or unanticipated obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techniques such as visual odometry allow the drone to continuously assess its position, maintaining stable flight even under degraded communications. Consequently, localized EW efforts—often limited to a specific radius—lose much of their disruptive power: the drone locks onto a target from beyond jamming range and proceeds without a human in the loop, significantly lowering the risk of signal loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future iterations of last-mile guidance can achieve an even higher degree of precision against moving targets. With adaptive flight path corrections and predictive modeling informed by large datasets of vehicle or human movement, AI systems can anticipate potential maneuvers. Simultaneously, continuous optical tracking further refines these forecasts, allowing the drone to rapidly respond to sudden deviations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although current systems still operate within what drone operators call a “reasonable impact radius”—meaning a tank or trench is likely to be hit, though not necessarily at its most vulnerable point—ongoing AI advancements and refinements in onboard hardware promise to narrow this margin considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 8: VGI-9, an Autonomous Navigation System&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As drone manufacturers shared with CSIS, VGI-9 is one of the most widely used targeting systems. It transforms an FPV drone into a semiautonomous weapons system capable of locking on the target and striking even moving targets at speeds of up to 80 km/h with precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the system requires a secure PIN code to activate the targeting function before each mission. Consequently, adversaries capturing the drone without the code cannot use its targeting capabilities. Once the drone is airborne, the pilot guides it to the operational zone while observing a real-time video feed with an enlarged picture in the corner of the screen to facilitate precise target identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system continuously monitors EW threats. The on-screen interface provides real-time feedback on signal interference through received signal strength (RSS) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) indications. If enemy jamming is present, the SNR value drops close to or below zero, indicating that the drone connection is heavily disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counteract this, the drone is equipped with a cruise control mode. If the drone encounters a disruption, the operator maintains a steady altitude and activates cruise control. As the name suggests, once engaged, the mode locks the drone’s altitude, speed, and direction, allowing it to continue its flight path even in areas with severe signal jamming. This fail-safe ensures the drone does not crash due to signal loss but instead bypasses jamming zones and remains operational beyond them, where the enemy forces or precious equipment can be located. This feature alone significantly increases the chances of mission success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the drone approaches the target area, the pilot searches for the target. Once the target is visually confirmed, the pilot activates the target lock-on function. At this point, control transitions from manual flight to autonomous engagement. The drone’s onboard system locks on to the selected point and begins its final descent toward the target without requiring further input from the pilot. If communication is still available, the pilot retains limited ability to make microadjustments. Using the right control stick, the pilot can slightly adjust the drone’s trajectory to ensure an optimal strike (e.g., the least-armored portion of an enemy tank).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a fully autonomous strike, the system ensures the drone stays on course, even without pilot intervention. The drone’s onboard AI handles the last moments of navigation, ensuring the maximum probability of a successful hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current state of this technology has limitations. The system significantly enhances effectiveness against large, high-value targets like tanks and artillery, but its precision is limited when targeting specific parts of a vehicle. While it ensures the drone reaches the target, it does not guarantee a strike on an exact point, such as a vulnerable section of a tank, to destroy the target completely, though disabling the target remains feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 9: Autonomous Navigation from The Fourth Law&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yaroslav Azhnyuk, founder of the company The Fourth Law, told CSIS that his company’s goal is to develop an AI-enabled guidance system for UAVs that allows them to operate in fully autonomous mode. The Fourth Law developed a module for FPV drones—an inexpensive yet powerful electronic component that includes a camera and a small computer board with software that costs around $50 to $100. This module may be installed on any of the most common configurations of FPV drones, whether 7 or 10 inch, between the two mounting rails where the drone’s front camera is usually placed. This technology is already operational and in serial production, integrated with dozens of manufacturers, and these systems are actively in use on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demonstration made to CSIS showed an FPV feed with added zoom and an active “target seeker,” illustrating how analog video, despite its poor resolution, remains widely used for its low cost and reliability. Once the pilot identifies a moving truck within the zoomed area, flipping a single switch encases the target in a red square and hands control over to the onboard AI. Two algorithms then work together: one continuously tracks the target’s movement, while the other manages the drone’s complex flight mechanics. A separate neural network refines the target’s boundaries in real time, ensuring precise engagement despite the vehicle’s ongoing motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company representatives told CSIS that The Fourth Law will soon introduce last-mile guidance for fixed-wing drones, allowing greater flight range, overcoming radio horizon limitations, and extending the operational distance by 48–96 km. However, the last-mile guidance system is just the first step in the company’s five-step road map to full autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second stage is the development of autonomous last-mile bombing. The process works like the current system, but instead of crashing into the target, the drone drops a bomb. This autonomous payload release system is already being tested in a lab. A computer can execute a drop with far greater precision than a human, even from complex maneuvers that a human pilot could not perform in time. After bombing is finished, the pilot regains control, bringing the drone back instead of losing it after every mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third crucial technology is also undergoing testing. Automatic targeting uses neural networks to identify and track targets autonomously. The team has successfully optimized object recognition using neural networks to run efficiently on very inexpensive hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By combining all three technologies, the company hopes pilots need only launch the drone and assign a waypoint on the map. The drone would take off, fly to the target, execute the drop, return, and land—all in complete radio silence and full autonomy, without requiring pilot intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a fourth step, the system will be able to navigate without GPS, using preloaded maps, onboard sensors, and optical navigation, ensuring mission success even in GPS-denied areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth stage of development involves automating takeoff and landing processes for both copter and fixed-wing drones, a critical advancement for the autonomous engagement of airborne threats such as enemy FPV drones. For instance, in a scenario in which troops are positioned in a trench under attack by enemy FPV drones, several sentry drones could be deployed in front of the trench and equipped with cameras to scan the sky. Upon detecting an incoming enemy FPV drone, these sentry drones could launch autonomously, either colliding with the threat or detonating nearby, thereby neutralizing the danger and safeguarding allied forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, The Fourth Law’s road map to full autonomy reflects the general approach Ukrainian companies take in developing autonomous capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 10: Ukrainian Long-Range-Strike Drones&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the many military systems Ukraine is enhancing with AI capabilities are one-way attack drones (OWA-UAVs). While these kamikaze drones are used everywhere along the front line, long-range-strike drones with some elements of autonomy represent a particularly interesting case. These drones are developed exclusively in Ukraine and have seen widespread use across various Ukrainian agencies. Their effectiveness and fast evolution demonstrate their ability to reach nearly any strategically significant target inside Russia, carrying enough explosives to destroy critical infrastructure, including factories, buildings, and airfields, along with the aircraft stationed there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous navigation has become an indispensable feature of long-range-strike drones, as flying long distances into enemy territory requires overcoming the enemy’s air defense and a 60 km-wide strip of EW systems along the border. While official sources in Ukraine refuse to comment on the technology they use, an industry representative revealed in an interview with CSIS that some of these advanced drones leverage basic AI technology for navigation and antijamming capabilities. An onboard computer allows the drones to navigate in EW environments and follow the preplanned flight route, often developed using large amounts of intelligence data collected by Ukraine or shared by allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually such a flight path consists of more than 1,000 waypoints to evade Russia’s air defense systems. The computer uses machine vision algorithms to compare what the drone “sees” using its sensors with the satellite and terrain data preloaded in its computer. AI models, trained to recognize geography and targets, allow the drone to autonomously identify its location and navigate to its target during the final approach with high precision and without requiring satellite communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One prominent example of a successful long-range-strike drone is the Lyutyi, which is reportedly responsible for up to 80 percent of successful attacks on Russian oil refineries. However, this drone is not yet fully autonomous. It can conduct some parts of the flight route autonomously, but its final approach to the target is mainly a manual process. Ukrainian officials declined to comment on how the system maintains communication with operators during the final approach phase. Also, such long-range-strike missions require meticulous preparation by analysts, intelligence officers, special services, and the operators themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Lyutyi operator noted he usually receives a detailed target analysis before the mission. He does not know the people who create the analysis, but the mission plan is a 15–20-page document describing the target and mission plan in minute-by-minute detail. It includes comprehensive information on factors such as air defense systems, satellite imagery, and radar data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same operator illustrated the complexity of planning an attack route by describing the challenges associated with a drone’s approach to its target. The drone must approach the target against the wind, and can face additional obstacles in its trajectory, such as pipes or other structural elements, necessitating careful navigation to ensure precise strikes. Moreover, the target is situated over 1,250 km away, and the operation often proceeds without an optical channel, thereby intensifying the level of difficulty involved and showing that the drone is operated manually in the last-mile approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 11: Autonomous Long-Range ISR Capability from Shield AI&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 2024, CSIS conducted several discussions with Shield AI, a U.S. defense technology firm focused on AI and drone systems. These conversations provided insights into how the company’s technology and collaboration with the Ukrainian military have evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the summer of 2024, Shield AI delivered a small batch of V-BAT systems to Ukraine for testing. At the time, to contend with EW, the V-BATs relied on sophisticated frequency hopping, spectrum changes, and higher-powered communication links rather than fully autonomous functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in 2024, Shield AI organized a two-part demonstration of the V-BAT’s capabilities in Ukraine. The first phase took place at a testing range, where seven powerful jammers operated simultaneously to challenge the aircraft’s resilience—an exercise the V-BAT passed successfully. In the second phase, Ukrainian forces launched the V-BAT from roughly 40 km behind the front lines, flew it an additional 95 km into contested territory, and located a battery of SA-11 Buk surface-to-air missiles. During this mission, the V-BAT relayed the target coordinates for a successful High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) strike, with Shield AI engineers providing field support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both phases, the aircraft was equipped with Shield AI’s Hivemind software, which offers state estimation capability in GPS-denied environments. The company stated that such capabilities are crucial to mission success. This state estimation software employs factor graph optimization, enabling unmanned vehicles to accurately determine their position, orientation, and velocity in real time by integrating sensor data from cameras, GPS, and inertial measurement units, even in environments with limited communication or GPS access. The system continuously refines this sensor information, recognizing potential hazards and adapting its flight path accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demonstrations revealed another advantage of V-BAT for Ukrainian battlefield operations—its flight range and loiter times. When the operation time of a drone increases to 8 to 10 hours instead of 1 to 2, it dramatically enlarges the window for ISR missions to identify and track critical targets. Therefore, AI-driven navigation in GPS-denied environments has proved a cornerstone for long-duration reconnaissance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the Ukrainian military placed an order with Shield AI for more than 200 Shield AI drones, though the company’s production capacity at the time was only 120 units per year, according to an interview with company representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned-2&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomous navigation makes drones strikes three to four times more likely to succeed.&lt;/strong&gt; By removing the need for constant manual control and stable communications—both vulnerable to EW and human stress—autonomous drones raise the target engagement success rate from around 10 to 20 percent to around 70 to 80 percent. Multiple interviewees from different Ukrainian military organizations and companies agreed that these figures are correct. This high level of reliability reduces demands on the skill level of the operator and makes the weapons system accessible to a greater number of warfighters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drones with autonomous navigation reduce overall strike costs by minimizing both drone losses and mission attempts.&lt;/strong&gt; Because these drones can conduct missions effectively and then return to base, fewer replacement units are required. In turn, military budgets may be allocated more strategically, focusing on additional research and development or acquiring specialized assets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster, more precise strikes decrease the time frame for enemy detection and retaliation, ultimately reducing the risk of counterattack.&lt;/strong&gt; When missions are completed in fewer attempts, adversaries have less opportunity to pinpoint the location or timing of an attack. This improved operational tempo decreases the likelihood of immediate enemy responses and increases the odds of mission success.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal training time for autonomous drone operation broadens access for frontline personnel.&lt;/strong&gt; Training that used to require extensive flight hours can now be condensed into a matter of hours or even minutes, according to a CSIS conversation with a Ukrainian military drone pilot instructor. This development empowers a larger pool of soldiers to operate drones effectively with minimal specialized skills.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encrypting onboard AI software preserves Ukraine’s technological lead by making autonomous systems difficult to reverse engineer.&lt;/strong&gt; Although adversaries can replicate hardware designs within weeks, sophisticated encryption measures on AI-enabled software slow down their ability to produce comparable systems. By maintaining a secure software advantage, Ukrainian forces continue to outpace opposing drone autonomy initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trends-2&quot;&gt;Trends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian authorities proactively introduce standalone autonomous modules into service, paving the way for scalable procurement and frontline deployment.&lt;/strong&gt; The Ukrainian military has initiated the process of codifying autonomous modules and introducing them into service in order to scale their procurement. By standardizing these modules as distinct components and developing guidelines on their integration and usage, the military can enable quicker adaptation of its arsenal and tactics to operational demands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drone training programs are incorporating autonomous navigation into their core curriculum to address the growing prevalence of self-guided systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the shift toward AI-assisted flight, educational institutions for drone operators now equip students with the skills to manage both manual and autonomous functionalities. On average, training to use autonomous functionalities takes less than a day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling fully autonomous flights—from takeoff through mission execution to landing—reduces operational costs and the need for constant equipment replenishment.&lt;/strong&gt; This holistic approach to autonomy mirrors advances in commercial aerospace, where reusability significantly lowers costs. By extending the life cycle of unmanned systems, militaries can allocate resources more efficiently while maintaining readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementing AI-enabled navigation in ground, sea, and undersea platforms marks the next major challenge, given the higher complexity and cost of these systems.&lt;/strong&gt; While aerial drones have led the way in autonomous operations, adapting similar capabilities for multidomain use requires tackling tougher technical and environmental hurdles. The promise to integrate autonomous navigation for ground systems is big, but practical implementation represents a challenge that Ukrainian defense companies have not yet tackled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomous navigation serves as a key building block for drone swarms, though fully autonomous swarm operations remain in the early stages.&lt;/strong&gt; While Ukrainian forces have conducted small-scale experiments, they have yet to field true swarms in which drones communicate, make decisions, and adjust actions collaboratively. Developing this level of coordination will require substantial progress in AI algorithms, communication protocols, and real-time decisionmaking capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern unmanned systems in Ukraine are not yet fully autonomous. While AI substantially enhances certain functions—from ISR to ATR and navigation—these enhancements are still partial in scope. The need to remove humans from direct combat remains a driving vision, but the limited scale of true autonomy reveals the extent of current technological limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than rely on comprehensive end-to-end solutions, Ukraine has adopted a step-by-step approach, incrementally introducing AI-driven capabilities to address specific operational challenges. This approach not only reflects the realities of ongoing warfare but also demonstrates the practical ways that military concepts, such as target selection and last-mile navigation, are being converted into battlefield-ready functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, AI has made a substantial difference in streamlining data analysis, reducing human error, and coping with EW, but it still requires human oversight—particularly for engagement decisions. Although these discrete functions bring Ukrainian unmanned systems closer to a vision of full autonomy, they have not converged into a seamlessly integrated autonomous process. In addition, a number of factors should be considered for future autonomy deployment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Model Complexity and Transparency:&lt;/strong&gt; Modern AI systems may be smaller and faster to train, but their black-box nature makes outcomes unpredictable in combat. Full autonomy remains high risk unless human operators can understand AI decisionmaking, ensuring reliable performance in life-or-death situations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Readiness and Integration in Military Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Adopting autonomous systems calls for thorough planning, including clear concepts of operation and inclusion in every part of the doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) framework, so that processes and policies match the demands of new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory and Legal Gaps:&lt;/strong&gt; Autonomy’s legal boundaries vary by country and remain largely undefined. Ukraine, for example, lacks definitions for “autonomy” and “autonomous weapons systems.” At the same time, it plans to align with international law, which also has critical uncertainties regarding ethical and legal questions related to autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data for AI Training Enabling Autonomy:&lt;/strong&gt; The war in Ukraine provides ample datasets to accelerate AI development and training using real-world data on enemy equipment. Nations lacking such direct battlefield information must plan well ahead to build and refine suitable datasets on enemy equipment for training and validating autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, key trends in Ukraine point toward a future in which reliable full autonomy might become a reality. First, the adoption of modular architectures for both hardware and software demonstrates a flexible approach that reduces development costs and streamlines upgrades. By separating AI software from the physical platforms, Ukrainian defense companies can more quickly update or replace specific functions, such as target recognition, without redesigning entire systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, a strong emphasis on open-source technologies and separate software sales demonstrates the benefits of leveraging existing innovations rather than reinventing each component from scratch. This helps maintain a rapid research and development cycle while keeping hardware affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the growing miniaturization of AI models, trained on smaller, carefully curated datasets, makes onboard real-time processing increasingly feasible. The resulting ability to execute advanced tasks, such as last-mile autonomous navigation, without depending on stable communications or satellite guidance reduces susceptibility to EW and expands operational reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, broader integration of unmanned systems into military strategy and operations, from common operating pictures to doctrinal reforms, signals that Ukrainian forces are serious about scaling AI beyond the experimental stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these measures do not yet combine into an entirely autonomous battlefield, they form the essential foundations of a technology road map that one day might yield fully autonomous warfare—but with continued human involvement where critical ethical and strategic judgments are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;將道德權威比喻為核武-黎再被問及核武意思&quot;&gt;將道德權威比喻為「核武」 黎再被問及「核武」意思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英第51日作供。控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行周一（3日）結束24日盤問。辯方代表大律師關文渭今開始覆問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前證供提到，黎於2019年7月10日參與美國智庫「保衛民主基金會」公開對談，期間黎稱香港極需要美國的支持，因美國政府有「道德權威」，好比「核武」。黎並強調中美之間的「戰爭」乃價值上的爭鋒，「他們（中國）好像沒有任何武器便上戰場，當你使用核武的話，只需一分鐘便可擺平他們。（It’s like they’re like going to the battle without any weapon, and you have the nuclear weapon you can finish them in a minute.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，他口中的「核武」是什麼意思。黎稱他當時是指在這個新冷戰中的「道德權威」，而這是中共不具備的，但美國則具備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到黎在座談會中另一處再度使用「武器」字眼，問黎的意思是否與「核武」不同？黎指「核武」和「武器」的意思是相同，均是以誇張的手法形容某些事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問，道德權威怎樣在一分鐘內擺平中國？黎則稱這是一種寫作的修辭手法。李素蘭追問，但黎當時不是在寫作，而是在談話？黎則認為兩者沒有分別，均是表達的方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問到，黎口中的「擺平（finish）」是什麼意思。黎指即是「打敗（defect）」。辯方問，「擺平」之後會有什麼結果？黎則稱，很難說結果會是怎樣。他又解釋，這番言論用意是想指出美國人忘記了自己的道德權威有多強大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問黎談論道德權威是否與中美貿易談判有關-黎稱僅談論一般情況&quot;&gt;官問黎談論道德權威是否與中美貿易談判有關 黎稱僅談論一般情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰接著問，黎是否在談論貿易談判，所以才提及道德權威。黎則稱道德權威不一定與貿易談判有關，他只是想說當時有很多人認為中國有貿易談判，因此覺得：「不要令他們失望、不要冒犯他們。」法官杜麗冰指，黎在接下來的言論，卻提到道德權威是「談判桌上的一個重要籌碼」。黎重申道德權威不一定與貿易談判直接有關，他在座談會上只是談論一般情況，並指出當美國與中國交往時，美國忘記了其道德權威有多重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官回應，他以為黎在座談會上說道德權威是談判籌碼，但似乎黎現在庭上提出了另一種說法。李素蘭指，當觀眾聽到黎的言論時，他們不會追問黎這句意思是什麼、那句意思是什麼，而是從黎的言論得出他們的理解。黎回應稱，他當時只是說一般情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方展示訊息顯示黎憂慮掟磚和掟汽油彈-惟沒有渠道向年輕人傳達訊息&quot;&gt;辯方展示訊息顯示黎憂慮掟磚和掟汽油彈 惟沒有渠道向年輕人傳達訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎早前供稱，與同案被告、律師助理陳梓華聯絡，是為了叫他聯絡勇武派領袖，平息示威暴力及要求勇武派成立領導團隊。控方早前盤問時質疑，黎為何認為和平的人能夠說服勇武的人？黎僅稱：「我們要嘗試所有辦法」，因暴力事件會破壞當時的運動。控方又質疑會否最後變成勇武的人反過來說服到和平的人使用暴力呢？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今問黎從何時開始有平息暴力的想法？黎則稱這不是「想法」，而是「邏輯思維」，因為當李柱銘介紹陳梓華時，將陳形容為「勇武派之中的保守派」，因此黎當時認為陳應該是聯絡激進人士的渠道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂向黎展示 Mark Simon 在2019年8月6日的訊息，他向黎表示關注有示威者投擲石頭，「他們應該知道，如果投擲石頭及殺死了人，便會在短期內嚴重地影響到運動。」黎回覆：「我對掟磚和掟汽油彈感到憂慮，但我沒有渠道向那些年輕人傳達這個訊息，除了我的專欄以外，我會在這星期的專欄提及這點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱從沒跟陳梓華談及國際戰線&quot;&gt;黎稱從沒跟陳梓華談及國際戰線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年區議會選舉之後，黎和陳梓華於2019年11月27日在停泊在金鐘的車上會面。陳梓華早前供稱黎說過要結合議會力量、街頭力量和國際力量，「推爆個政府」。黎早前則供稱自己可能講過議會和街頭力量，但是否認講過國際力量，因他從沒想過國際線的議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎在控方的盤問下說法卻有所不同，稱記不起自己有否跟陳梓華提及過國際戰線。辯方今再問黎，他有否跟陳梓華談及國際戰線？黎表示他從沒向陳談及國際戰線，所以這從不是二人之間的話題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎堅稱未曾跟陳梓華談及初選沒參與籌辦初選&quot;&gt;黎堅稱未曾跟陳梓華談及初選、沒參與籌辦初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月31日，黎與陳梓華第四次見面。陳早前供稱，黎在該次見面中談及民主派初選。今在辯方覆問下，黎表示很難回憶起有否說過初選，但他認為自己未曾跟陳談及初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到2020年7月12日初選結束後，陳向黎傳送 Signal 訊息：「感謝你為初選所做的一切，這是香港歷史上重要的一頁（Hi Jimmy, thanks for everything on the primary election. It’s remarkable on our HK history.）。」辯方問黎，為何陳梓華在初選翌日傳送這個訊息？黎認為陳純粹告知他，或者純粹向他表達感受。辯方又問，在7月12日之前，黎有否與陳談論過初選？黎稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰質疑，陳在訊息中「感謝你為初選所做的一切」，問陳是感謝黎什麼？黎估計是感謝《蘋果》在初選期間提供了平台，但黎強調他並沒有參與其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又提到2020年2月26日，陳梓華向黎智英傳送「眾志聯盟」的出選名單，新西派出朱凱廸、新東派出何桂藍、九東派出黃之鋒、梁凱晴做「Plan B」、九西派出張崑陽、港島派出羅冠聰、超區則派出岑敖暉。黎當時回覆陳：「我們要努力說服他們，如果初選有認受性，他們也必須參與。且看看事態發展如何。（Thanks. We’ve to work on them. But if the primary has legitimacy, they will have to join. Let’s see.）」陳回覆：「我會盡力說服。（I will try my best to work on it.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否涉及安排出選名單？黎則稱從來沒有聯絡過名單上的人士，但是他相信民主黨林卓廷有參與初選，而他經常與林卓廷、李永達和何俊仁等人吃晚飯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱陽明山會議有可能談及國際線-因劉祖廸在場&quot;&gt;黎稱陽明山會議有可能談及國際線 因劉祖廸在場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年1月11日，黎智英在台灣陽明山別墅，與陳梓華、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和一名女子會面。陳梓華早前供稱，黎在會議中稱要團結「不同的板塊」，包括議會、海外組織、街頭力量、國際線及商人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述黎在主問時稱，自己從沒有這種想法，反指這種想法是來自陳，然後將說話塞進他的嘴裏。惟黎在控方盤問之下，卻改稱他有可能談及國際、議會和街頭這三條戰線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂問黎，有否在會議中談及國際、議會和街頭戰線？黎回應，在他與陳梓華的交流中，國際線從不是話題之一。他稱他可能談及街頭和議會戰線，但他亦有可能談及國際線，因為劉祖廸當時在場。惟黎同時補充，他從不知道陳梓華參與國際線。辯方追問，劉祖廸在會議中談及國際線時說了什麼？黎則稱已不記得他說過什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，為何邀請劉祖廸出席會議？黎稱因為當時是籲勇武派自我組織、組成領袖團隊的好時機。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱沒參與籌備初選-官質疑黎曾叫陳梓華說服眾志聯盟參選者&quot;&gt;黎稱沒參與籌備初選 官質疑黎曾叫陳梓華說服「眾志聯盟」參選者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方盤問期間，曾追問黎是否關注（concerned about）民主派初選。黎當時稱他不關注，因為他與初選無關。控方質疑從訊息紀錄可見，黎一直緊貼初選的事態發展，並問黎的「concern」是什麼。黎僅稱「My concern is that I am not concerned about Primary Election anymore.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎確認上述對答，並稱這是他英文用字不小心。辯方要求黎澄清他口中的「concern」是什麼意思（註：英文“concern”可理解為「關注」、「擔憂」或「與某事情有關」）。黎稱當時他們正在研究電子投票的可能性，而他作為初選組織者李永達和物色電子投票程式的李兆富之間的「中間人」，他認為電子投票的主意很好，因可以方便市民，吸引更多人投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問黎是否有興趣參與初選工作？黎則稱他對於電子投票感興趣，但是他沒有參與初選的籌備工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰則反駁指，當陳梓華傳送眾志聯盟的初選名單給黎之後，黎回應陳：「我們要努力說服他們（We’ve to work on them.）」，因此黎的確有牽涉初選。黎則稱訊息中的「我們」泛指民主派陣營的人士，因為他們在同一陣營之中，所以使用「我們」一字。辯方問黎有否說服名單上的人士？黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭質疑，陳梓華回覆說：「我會盡力說服」，是否因為黎叫陳去說服？黎指陳只是告訴他會盡力說服，但他不知道陳有否真的說服名單上的人，他亦表示對於陳認識名單上的人感到意外。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，黎將「眾志聯盟」的出選名單轉發給李卓人，並傳送相似訊息：「我們要努力說服他們，至少我們透過得到大部份泛民的支持，使初選有認受性，（We have to work on them. At least we’ve make our primary legitimised by support of majority of Pan Democrats.）」李卓人回覆：「會努力說服他們。會告訴戴耀廷和區諾軒。（Will work on them. Will tell Benny and 區諾軒）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上稱，正如剛才所說，他在訊息中使用「我們」，是因為泛指民主派。法官李運騰指從李卓人的回覆「會努力說服他們」，可以理解至少黎正在要求李卓人說服他們，又問黎是否要求李卓人說服名單上的人？黎則同意。惟他指李卓人不是初選的組織者之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎專欄文章稱中共撕掉基本法-今稱從新聞得知&quot;&gt;黎專欄文章稱中共「撕掉《基本法》」 今稱從新聞得知&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前控方證據提到，黎在2020年4月26日的專欄文章〈專橫暴政打壓 我們氣魄不滅〉中稱：「中共出擊撕掉《基本法》，摧殘香港一國兩制特別行政區地位。沒有釋法權利的港澳辦和中聯辦高調曲線釋法，稱兩辦並非《基本法》22條所指的一般意義上的『中央人民政府所屬各部門』，公然向港府奪權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方曾問黎，「撕掉《基本法》」和「高調曲線釋法」的說法，是從什麼官方渠道得知。黎堅稱有官方出處，但是他不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今再問黎，他當時是指哪個官方出處。黎稱不記得，相信當時是李柱銘或何俊仁告知他，而二人均是律師，因此相信二人。黎又稱，他肯定因閱讀新聞報導而得知，所以才會在其專欄文章中引述。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否知道有沒有任何官方資訊來源，指稱「撕掉《基本法》」和「高調曲線釋法」？黎澄清他意思是從新聞得知上述說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎向高院申請離港時未提及會見美國官員計劃-黎解釋過於政治敏感&quot;&gt;黎向高院申請離港時未提及會見美國官員計劃 黎解釋：過於政治敏感&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早前盤問時指，黎於2020年6月向高院申請更改保釋條件，要求獲准出境到美國探望剛出生的孫女。控方質疑黎以孫女出生作為藉口和掩飾，反指黎向法庭隱瞞前往美國的真正原因是要會見美國官員和議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今問黎，即使沒有會見美國官員的計劃，黎會否依然向法庭申請更改保釋條件？黎稱會，因為要探望孫女。辯方提到，黎在申請離港期間，未有提及會見美國官員的計劃，問黎為什麼？黎認為前往美國的主要原因是探望孫女；雖然在當時而言，會見美國官員不是違法，但是向法庭提及的話便會過於政治敏感。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否有意圖誤導法庭？黎稱認為沒有需要告知法庭其會見官員計劃，所以便沒有披露。法官李運騰問，黎是否認為若然不告知法庭的話，便有較大機會獲批准出境？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱與袁弓夷相處感不安-惟未想過停止袁使用蘋果平台&quot;&gt;黎稱與袁弓夷相處感不安 惟未想過停止袁使用《蘋果》平台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月《蘋果》發起「一人一信救香港」，黎安排員工替袁彌明父親、現被警方通緝的袁弓夷拍攝影片，向特朗普作公開呼籲。黎早前在庭上稱，後來他與袁弓夷數次交流之後，便開始感到不安（uneasy），並嘗試疏遠他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今問黎為何有這種不安感？黎稱源於一次晚飯期間袁所說的說話，但他已不記得具體內容。但黎記得時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹的訊息談及袁及一名逃往紐約的「逃犯」，而該人士十分可疑。辯方遂展示有關訊息，黎在訊息中告訴張：「他（袁）是郭文貴的人」，又告訴張：「他（袁）想與我合作反共。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，既然黎對袁感到不安，黎有否停止讓他使用《蘋果》這個平台。黎則稱沒有想過這問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安法生效後-黎未要求mark-simon撤回制裁名單提議&quot;&gt;國安法生效後 黎未要求Mark Simon撤回制裁名單提議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月23日黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 在訊息中提到，華盛頓正在討論制裁名單，而 Mark 提出只將香港官員列入制裁名單。控方早前盤問指，在2020年7月國安法生效之後，黎並未有要求 Mark Simon 撤回他向美國國安委所提議的制裁名單。當時黎要求庭上解釋為何當時未有如此做，惟遭法官杜麗冰制止。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今問黎相關原因。黎稱在國安法生效之後，他可能忘記了這件事，又稱他當時可能認為國安法使以往合法的事情變得非法，然而生效之前的事情便會變為過時（obsolete）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;專欄稱勾結外國勢力是叛國罪可以被槍斃-黎稱僅複述蕭若元言論&quot;&gt;專欄稱勾結外國勢力是叛國罪、可以被槍斃 黎稱僅複述蕭若元言論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月5日黎的專欄文章〈飛翔吧 良知的脊樑在撐著〉提到：「有心人說，快點走，勾結外國勢力是叛國罪，可以是槍斃的啊！」控方盤問時質疑，黎明知上述言論明顯不實，並揶揄黎：「你似乎毫不在乎真相。」黎則反複重申，他只是複述別人告訴他的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今問黎，為什麼會說「勾結外國勢力是叛國罪」。黎則稱因為網上有一名被稱為「神燈」的人士，惟一時想不起對方全名，並突然轉用廣東話，稱：「佢個仔係做電影」、「咩元吖？」、「佢以前係做編劇⋯⋯喺亞視。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指該人士在網上頻道中提及他的姓名，以及叫他離開香港，「我認為他只是說一些說話嚇我，叫我離開。」被問到是否私下認識該「有心人」，黎稱認識，但是一時忘記他的名字。後來在小休之後，黎向法庭表示，記起該「有心人」可能是蕭若元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎回覆蓬佩奧助手問題-承認不小心使用制裁一字&quot;&gt;黎回覆蓬佩奧助手問題 承認不小心使用「制裁」一字&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前證據顯示2020年7月15日，Mark Simon 轉發時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧的助手 Mary Kissel 的訊息，要求黎澄清對於撤銷香港特殊地位的立場。黎回覆：「我是說撤銷香港特殊地位是不需要的，因為在《國安法》下，香港怎樣也好都會完蛋。重點不在於香港而在於中國。制裁中國以阻止她打壓香港。但是就此思考後，我認為他們撤回香港特殊地位是正確的，因為一旦美國和中國之間脫鈎，香港會是中國的出口。若然關閉這個中國的出口的話，會更輕易地迫使中國回應美國的要求。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問到黎與 Mary Kissel 之間的交情。黎稱截至2020年為止，他與 Mary Kissel 相識超過15年。因 Mary Kissel 曾在香港替《華爾街日報》擔任社評撰稿人，黎在當時開始認識她。後來她返回美國繼續替《華爾街日報》工作，然後在華爾街工作，繼而成為蓬佩奧的助手。黎又稱，在這15年期間，他與 Mary Kissel 不常聯絡，但他記得每年 Mary Kissel 的生日，他都會送花給她，直至她離開《華爾街日報》。被問到有否在2019至2020年期間送花，黎稱在她成為蓬佩奧助理之後便沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱因為 Mary Kissel 是蓬佩奧的助手，所以如果她直接跟他對話，便會很敏感。黎又指，當時只是打算經 Mark Simon 回答 Mary Kissel 的問題，沒想過她會使用其回覆作其他目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述控方指黎透過 Mark Simon，直接請求美國撤銷香港特殊地位，辯方問黎有沒有這個意圖？黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，為什麼黎在訊息中提及「制裁」？黎則稱：「我不知道為什麼，我估計就是這樣不小心。」法官李素蘭追問「不小心」是什麼意思。黎稱：「我不知道這是一個危險的字眼。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;twitter帖文問選舉主任應負責任嗎&quot;&gt;Twitter帖文問「選舉主任應負責任嗎？」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月7日，美國財政部宣佈制裁11名侵犯人權及損害香港自治的中港官員，包括時任特首林鄭月娥。翌日黎 Twitter 發布帖文：「那些取消候選人資格的選舉主任又如何呢？他們應該在個人層面上為這些決定負責任嗎？」控方盤問時指，黎透過上述帖文請求外國制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今要求黎澄清有否在帖文中請求制裁。黎稱他沒有請求制裁，但同時承認帖文用字帶有暗示制裁的意味，因帖文意思是選舉主任應該為他們所作的決定負責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示尚餘 Slack 群組裡的「飯盒會」紀錄需要覆問。案件明日下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

The continent is on the verge of a “big bang” moment which could unlock more than a trillion dollars in defense funding over the next decade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “three-day war” in Ukraine passed the three-year mark. This dark anniversary came with a glimmer of light: the growing prospect of peace talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after a surprise phone call between Putin and President Donald J. Trump, the only ones showing much optimism were Russian leaders. By the end of last week, this optimism had turned to delight after Washington voted with Moscow on two UN resolutions and a disastrous public Oval Office meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the talk about talks, the only real change to the dynamics surrounding the conflict since President Trump took office is the creeping loss of Ukraine’s single biggest backer, the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was confirmed yesterday when the White House announced it would suspend all military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to compel Kyiv—and induce Moscow—into making a peace deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin was quick to welcome this move. It is good news for Putin, who has been waiting three years for Ukraine’s supporters to capitulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the same events were met with shock and horror in Europe, whose leaders quickly rallied around Zelensky and Ukraine. An informal meeting of European leaders in London on Sunday hosted by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was rapidly reconfigured into a crisis summit with the stated goal of “securing our future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their unstated goal was to say loud and clear to the people of Ukraine: Europe has got your back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This message was also aimed at Washington and Moscow. Europe’s leaders are hoping Trump and Putin heard their call that, in Starmer’s words, “Europe must do the heavy lifting”—on both Ukraine and European security. They want to convince Trump they are taking his demands to share the burden of transatlantic security seriously, and Putin that “we are doubling down in our support” to Ukraine for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving all three goals—backing Ukraine, placating Trump, and outlasting Putin—will take more than crisis meetings and strong words. Since 2014, Europe has been taking defense more seriously. But thanks to Trump’s dramatic policy shift away from transatlantic security, the price tag of strengthening Ukraine and defending Europe just went up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Europe is on the verge of a “big bang” moment, which could unlock more than a trillion dollars in funding for European defense over the next decade. An emergency EU summit on Thursday will see European leaders take the first steps in their journey to save Ukraine and lead the free world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;peace-through-ukrainian-strength&quot;&gt;Peace Through Ukrainian Strength&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s most urgent task is to forge peace through strength in Ukraine. Getting Putin to the negotiating table will mean convincing him he cannot win the war now; getting a lasting ceasefire and peace deal will require convincing him he cannot try again later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the London summit committed Europe to “keep the military aid flowing . . . To strengthen Ukraine now,” and to “keep boosting Ukraine’s own defensive capabilities . . . To deter any future invasion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These commitments are even more pertinent in the absence of security guarantees for Ukraine. In London, leaders committed only to develop a “coalition of the willing,” but made any guarantees contingent on “strong US backing.” This is something President Trump has consistently played down—in part because preemptive security guarantees could undermine Trump’s main goal of getting Putin to the negotiating table. If Putin judges that guarantees—and European troops—will only appear once the fighting stops, then he won’t stop fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if Trump can bring Putin to the negotiating table, it will be a tall order to persuade him to make peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin thinks he is winning in Ukraine and has little incentive to end the war. Russia may have lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers and up to a million (mostly young, educated) emigrants, but Putin has consolidated power at home and abroad. He has forged a wartime economy that is now producing more than all of Europe, tightened his grip on power through political repression and media control, and deepened his alliances with China, Iran, and North Korea. History suggests wars are good for dictators—even necessary. Besides, what Putin wants is not a slice of territory, but a Ukraine subjugated and neutered. No talks could ever satisfy those desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more likely scenario is a repeat of the Minsk I and II process, in which Russia dragged out talks and repeatedly broke ceasefire agreements with little intention of reaching a lasting settlement. In the short term, this would provide cover for Russian forces to press forward and exploit Ukraine’s weakening position on the battlefield. In the longer term, it would buy time for Russian forces to regroup and reconstitute to attack again en masse when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests what really matters among all the noise about peace talks is Ukraine’s military strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong Ukrainian military, which cannot be defeated on the battlefield, is the only realistic impediment to Russia’s crude but effective attempts to dominate its near abroad using military force. President Trump’s attempts at coercion and accommodation might be worth a shot, but diplomacy is no match for “brute force” when it comes to warlike leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wisdom was famously applied by the U.S. diplomat George F. Kennan in his 1946 long telegram, assessing Soviet power under Joseph Stalin as “impervious to logic of reason, and . . . highly sensitive to logic of force.” Kennan’s prescription was “a policy of firm containment” based on political, economic, and military strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same words also describe Russian power under Vladimir Putin today. Zelensky echoed Kennan’s diagnosis when he addressed Ukraine’s parliament in October: “The Russian leadership acts aggressively only when it is convinced that it will not receive an adequate destructive response.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his address, Zelensky also channeled Kennan in his own prescription to secure Ukraine’s security via “peace through strength.” This phrase echoed one used by another U.S. official: Keith Kellogg. In a report published months before he was appointed as President Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Lt. General (Ret.) Kellogg describes Trump’s approach as promoting “deterrence and peace through strength.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO and EU leaders have also identified peace through Ukrainian strength as the best solution for keeping their own citizens safe. As NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte declared after allied defense ministers met this month, NATO’s task is to “help Ukraine in its fight today and to build up Ukraine’s armed forces in the long-term.” And as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated in the commission’s political guidelines last year: “The best investment in European security is investing in the security of Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;europe-unable-america-unwilling&quot;&gt;Europe Unable, America Unwilling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the war began, peace through strength in Ukraine has been pursued through a combination of Western-funded equipment and Ukrainian grit. As Trump put it last week: “They’re very brave,” but “without the United States and its money and its military equipment, this war would have been over in a very short period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this formula is now in doubt because Ukraine’s main backers are reaching the political and economic limits of what they can provide. Europe, Ukraine’s largest backer to date, has plenty of political will but is hitting the limit of its fiscal and industrial capacity. Meanwhile, the United States has the opposite problem: It can afford and produce much more, but the political desire to do so has disappeared under the new administration. (Compare the administration’s stance on Ukraine to the $4 billion in military assistance and $12 billion in military sales expedited to Israel since January, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe and the United States have been Ukraine’s largest backers since 2022. Europe has been the most generous, providing $138 billion (and committing another $120 billion), compared to $119 billion (and $4 billion) from the United States. When measured proportionately, the United States lags much further behind—19 European nations have given more to Ukraine than the U.S. total of 0.53 percent of GDP since 2022, with some European nations even exceeding 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are large sums of money, but they are not enough to meet Ukraine’s needs. Russian forces continue to grind out small victories on the battlefield and attack civilian areas with hundreds of cost-effective drone and missile strikes. Zelensky has already warned that Ukraine is now running out of Patriot air defense missiles. Moreover, as the authors of a Kiel Institute report point out, for most nations this level of funding is “like a minor political ‘pet project’ rather than a major fiscal effort,” comparable to domestic subsidies for diesel fuel and company cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet even at these relatively low and inadequate levels, both Europe and the United States have significant constraints on their ability to maintain aid to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has a plentiful supply of political goodwill toward Ukraine but lacks the fiscal and industrial capacity to make good on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although overall European defense spending has risen sharply since 2022, spending levels vary widely. Nations closer to Moscow spend much more than others. But some of the leaders in spending measured by percentage of GDP are laggards in absolute investment, due to the size of their economies. (For example, in 2024, Latvia’s 3.15 percent of GDP equated to just $1.4 billion, while Poland and Italy both spend just under $35 billion even though Poland spent 4 percent of its GDP compared to Italy’s 1.5 percent.) Neither does the GDP measure indicate the quality or nature of investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the European Union is limited by its 2023 Stability and Growth Pact on borrowing large amounts to fund higher defense spending—like it did after Covid-19 through a recovery fund of $840 billion. EU member states have equivocated over removing borrowing limits on defense spending since the war began but have yet to pull the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if they do, increased spending might not solve the problem of Europe’s limited defense industrial capacity. Ukraine now depends on the defense industry in Europe and elsewhere for two-thirds of its military aid. But current capacity is either low or nonexistent in key areas such as guided weapons, tanks, and aircraft. “Europeans and the Ukrainians have nothing in their depots,” according to the CEO of Rheinmetall. Meanwhile, the Russian defense industry is now outproducing the whole of Europe (when measured by purchasing power parity). Hence the Kiel Institute’s assessment that the war has become “a battle of procurement and military production.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also has industrial capacity issues. However, Washington’s limits on providing support to Ukraine are primarily political.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good shorthand for President Trump’s policies is to assume he will do the exact opposite of the Biden administration. This is true for Ukraine. While Biden committed to support Kyiv “for as long as it takes,” Trump campaigned on removing support for Ukraine. Where Biden aimed to force Russia to negotiate (or capitulate) by putting Ukraine in a position of strength, Trump aims to compel Ukraine to accept compromises for the sake of a deal and use the potential for Ukrainian weakness to incentivize Moscow. As he said when asked if the United States would keep providing Ukraine with weapons: “Maybe until we have a deal with Russia . . . We need to have a deal, otherwise it’s going to continue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dramatic reversal in Washington’s policy leaves the burden of “peace through Ukrainian strength” resting on Europe’s shoulders. This may have been the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington’s shift in Ukraine policy was accompanied by a broader shift in its policy toward Europe. The last three weeks have cemented the new reality that transatlantic security is no longer Washington’s foreign policy priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stance is not new—the United States has been pivoting to Asia since at least 2011. Neither does it mean Washington will abandon Europe. As U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told NATO defense ministers on February 13: “We must make NATO great again . . . suggestions of abandonment otherwise continue to be disingenuous and we are—we are proud to be part of this alliance and stand by it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, Europe must now assume responsibility for its own security to an extent it has not done since before 1941. This will take decisive action and sustained investment to strengthen Ukraine’s hand and defend the continent from Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;europes-trillion-dollar-big-bang-moment&quot;&gt;Europe’s Trillion Dollar “Big Bang” Moment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insofar as they face an acute threat from Russia and an increasingly disinterested—or at least distracted—United States, Ukraine and Europe are in the same boat. If Europe is going to shoulder the burden of strengthening Ukraine and its own defenses, it is going to need a bigger boat. This means spending more on defense—a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that European defense is on the verge of a “big bang” moment that could transform its ability to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European defense was slow to rouse from its post–Cold War slumber. By 2022, EU defense spending was only 1.3 percent of GDP. This changed after Russia’s full-scale invasion, when European NATO allies raised defense investment to 2 percent of their collective GDP. Meanwhile, the European Union’s Versailles Declaration, adopted three weeks after the war began, led to several new initiatives designed to strengthen European defense and support Ukraine. These have provided tens of billions of euros for both European procurement and Ukrainian defense and reconstruction—including from the revenue of frozen Russian assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the true potential of European defense remains largely untapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next NATO summit will take place in June in The Hague, the Netherlands. If every European member of NATO took that opportunity to raise defense spending from their current average of 2 percent to 3 percent—as at least four allies already did last year—it would raise nearly $200 billion. Germany alone could add $220 billion if it agrees on a new “whatever it takes” special fund for defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If EU leaders agreed to exempt defense spending from the current budget constraints, they could jointly borrow hundreds of billions toward their own target of investing over $500 billion in defense over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If negotiations this year over the European Union’s next budget cycle (2028–2034) meet the target set by the bloc’s new defence commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, that could add $110 billion to EU defense spending (defense spending in the current cycle was only around $11 billion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Europe agreed to liquidate Russia’s frozen assets, it could provide another $300 billion. As Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has urged: “Enough talking, it’s time to act! Let’s finance our aid for Ukraine from the Russian frozen assets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the European Commission is able to repurpose untapped Covid-19 recovery funds, it would make available up to $100 billion, while redirecting portions of the $50 billion EU “Cohesion Fund”—designed to help lower income member states through investment in environment and transport—could make several billion available for defense and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original purpose of the London summit was to discuss the United Kingdom’s idea for a European “rearmament bank,” a joint fund to issue AAA-rated debt to finance increased defense spending across Europe. If agreed, this might raise up to $25 billion in government “seed funding,” which could underpin up to $250 billion of private capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of “ifs” on the table. But taken together, these measures would unlock vast amounts of new funding. European defense’s big-bang moment could be worth well over a trillion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of Thursday’s meeting, von der Leyen has already previewed some of the measures on the table as part of a package called “ReARM Europe.” These include relaxing the European Union’s fiscal rules on debt for defense spending, a loan program of up to €150 billion ($165 billion) backed by the European Union’s common budget, and reallocating some of the Cohesion Fund. These initial measures still require EU leaders to unanimously agree with them. The biggest threat comes from Hungary, although Budapest’s opposition appears to be narrowly focused on support to Ukraine rather than strengthening European defense writ large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-arsenal-of-democracy-in-europe&quot;&gt;The Arsenal Of Democracy in Europe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if EU leaders can agree to these measures, a flood of new spending will not amount to much without the capacity to produce the weapons, ammunition, and equipment that Ukraine—and Europe—needs. As Rutte put it: “Our industry must be able to produce what our extra money allows us to procure.” Europe must transform itself into a modern arsenal of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU leaders have repeatedly emphasized their aim of “ramping up defence production,” alongside financing defense and supporting Ukraine. This follows the 2024 European Defence Industrial Strategy (EDIS) and the Draghi report on competitiveness—both of which urged Europe to revitalize its defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s defense industry has struggled to overcome three decades of relative neglect. One high profile example is the failure to deliver the flagship procurement of 1 million NATO-standard 155 millimeter artillery shells for Ukraine. This target was eventually met but only after significant delays. This episode suggests Europe may struggle to provide Ukraine with more complex systems at scale, such as air and missile defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Europe’s defense industry has retained a focus on quality and advanced technology, even while sacrificing capacity and increasing fragmentation. The challenge now is how to scale up and increase cooperation—a perennial challenge for Europe. The “big bang” approach advocated by Kubilius is designed to do this by aggregating demand and achieving economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of what could be achieved is the European Union’s first investment in support for common procurement, a new $330 million incentive that has led to over $12 billion in multinational contracts for air and missile defense systems, armored vehicles, and artillery ammunition. There are also several examples of joint procurement for Ukraine. These amount to at least $5.5 billion to date, including a $1.0 billion Czechia-led ammunition initiative and the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine, which has provided at least $1.5 billion of military aid since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union and NATO have long deployed incentive-backed instruments to encourage cooperation and innovation. But the small amounts of funding attached—millions not billions—have not made much difference. If this model can be applied across the defense industrial landscape using the flood of funding that may be about to appear, it would lead to a revolutionary change in European defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason for a “big bang” approach to transforming European defense is a continued dependence on defense industries beyond Europe. Ukraine currently builds or finances about 55 percent of its military hardware but relies on Europe (25 percent) and the United States (20 percent) for the rest. For Europe, most of the money spent on defense since the war began has left the continent. According to the EDIS, 78 percent of new EU spending in 2022 and 2023 left Europe, with 63 percent of this going to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this situation allows Ukraine and Europe to meet urgent combat requirements, recapitalize depleted stockpiles, and access complex systems they cannot produce on their own—such as Patriot missile defense systems or combat aircraft like the F-16 and F-35—it also undermines sovereign supply, exposing Europe to external supply challenges. This is why the EDIS gave member states the target of procuring at least 50 percent of defense equipment from within the European Union by 2030 and 60 percent by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine would also benefit from a stronger, more self-sufficient European defense industry. It already has to some extent, given that at least half of the military aid it has received since the start of the war came from Europe and at least 25 percent of its current supply of weapons and equipment is produced there. One example of a weapon system that has been critical to Ukraine’s performance on the battlefield is strike drones, which have helped Ukrainian forces overcome a 5:1 manpower deficit to fight Russian forces to a standstill. This month the German company Helsing announced it would supply Ukraine with 6,000 HX-2 strike drones—adding to the 4,000 HX-1 drones already being delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of AI-enabled “precise mass” in Ukraine—and in modern warfare writ large—will place more emphasis on less exquisite technology like drones and artillery. This could be a boon for the European defense industry, and even a comparative advantage over the U.S. and Korean industries, which are more geared toward complex, high-end systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s own defense industry shows what’s possible. It already produces $30 billion a year in weapons, six times what it did just a year ago. Ukraine is now the world’s largest manufacturer of military autonomous systems, able to make over 4.5 million drones per year. It plans to make 30,000 long-range drones and 3,000 missiles this year. While the European Union struggled to make 1 million shells, Ukraine already makes 2.5 million artillery and mortar rounds annually. In the last year, Ukraine’s production of artillery systems tripled while production of armored vehicles increased fivefold. Europe will also benefit from this transformation if it can learn from Ukraine’s impressive ability to rapidly scale manufacturing, adopt commercial technology, and feed lessons from the front line into its procurement system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Ukraine’s defense industry has grown so fast that its production capacity has outstripped financing. In a speech to the annual European Defence Agency conference last month, Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov explained that while capacity will reach $37 billion this year, available funding is only $18 billion. Umerov appealed to Europe “to help us close this existing gap in financing” to make sure Ukraine’s production potential does not go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of doing this is the “Danish model” of procuring directly from Ukraine’s defense industry. In 2024, Denmark became the first country to order weapons made in Ukraine for use by Ukrainian armed forces. To date, around $950 million worth of Ukrainian-made artillery and drones have been ordered by Denmark and delivered to Ukraine. Denmark has also set up a “Defence Industry Hub” in Kyiv to enhance cooperation between the Danish and Ukrainian defense industries. At least two other countries have also adopted the “Danish model.” In October, the Netherlands announced a plan to purchase around $440 million of drones from Ukraine, with a 50–50 production share. Last week Norway also committed to buy $312 million of drones and other military equipment from Ukrainian firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transforming European defense would also benefit the United States’ defense industry—the original arsenal of democracy—in three important ways. First, by giving even more buying power to the largest global importer of U.S. arms: Europe. No matter how quickly Europe revitalizes its own defense industry, it will continue to rely on U.S. companies for advanced air defense, combat aircraft, missile and long-range artillery systems, plus other technology. Second, expanded coproduction arrangements provide European leaders political and economic incentives to buy more U.S. weapons. They also lower the unit cost of weapons for Washington through economies of scale. Examples range from a recent $5.5 billion coproduction agreement for 1,000 Patriot interceptors, to a Cold War agreement to produce Sidewinder missiles in West Germany. Third, by enabling the United States to focus more squarely on its declared priority of Indo-Pacific security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Europe can generate a flood of new funding and transform its defense industry, the only remaining question is what purpose would all this military power serve? The answer for Ukraine was provided by President von der Leyen: “It is basically turning Ukraine into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders.” A “porcupine” military strategy is the best way for Ukraine to credibly deter Russia within the constraints it has on manpower, industrial capacity, and cost. It would also minimize any security dilemma with Russia by being a conspicuously defensive force. For Europe, the answer is much more of the same: deterrence and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leaders-of-the-free-world&quot;&gt;Leaders of the Free World?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 10, 2022, just days after Russia’s invasion began, EU leaders met in Versailles. They declared that “Russia’s war of aggression constitutes a tectonic shift in European history” and agreed on an ambitious agenda to strengthen European defense and support Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday’s summit could be another Versailles moment for Europe. The last two weeks have produced another tectonic shift that demands a continent-wide response. Through their urgent plan to “rearm Europe,” European leaders must find a way to unlock a trillion euros to fund large increases in defense spending and transform Europe’s industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This moment was years in the making. Since 2014, the pressure on European defense has been building. Increased spending and a proliferation of initiatives to strengthen EU defense and the “European pillar” of NATO have laid the foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing missing was a spark to ignite the big bang—until President Trump provided a shower of sparks in a week that “shook up the world.” The events which followed his February 12 call with the Kremlin threatened to put transatlantic relations back to 1941 as he considered appeasing Putin, called Zelensky a “dictator,” berated Europe, and cut off Ukraine (even if only temporarily).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of these watershed events was summarized by one Wall Street Journal headline: “Trump, Not Putin, Forces Europe to Get Serious About Defense.” Or as one observer on Bluesky put it: “European defence was born this week—by caesarian, but still.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after Friday’s shouting match in the Oval Office added more fuel to the fire, Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s high representative for foreign affairs, declared: “Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Europe’s big bang comes to fruition, it could generate vast amounts of new defense investment in the coming years. But this moment is about more than funding, as Kallas implies. The most important thing Europe can do for Ukraine and the free world is transform its ability to defend the continent from Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the Soviet Union during the Cold War, Putin’s Russia is the biggest threat to a Europe whole and free. And just like the Cold War, the consequences of the confrontation between Russia and the West are global. Unlike his Soviet-communist counterparts, Putin might not want to “run the world”—but he would like to see the world run by fellow autocrats. This world would eschew the liberal rules and norms that have guided the conduct of international relations since 1945, a period of unprecedented global peace, prosperity, and liberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the world would be a much darker place where might makes right. Powerful countries would be entitled to spheres of influence within which they would be free to dominate and subjugate weaker countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine shows what a world of authoritarian “multipolarity” would look like. It is not just a battle for Ukrainian sovereignty, but for the future of global order. Ukraine is the first bulwark against a world of authoritarian disorder—which is why it must be strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second bulwark is Europe itself—hence the need to rearm, quickly, and at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third bulwark is the United States. By withdrawing its support for Ukraine, questioning its own role in transatlantic security, and appearing to align with Russia on key issues, President Trump risks weakening the West’s defense against authoritarian disorder. It is possible that Trump is betting that his unprecedented actions will provide the spark Europe needed to ignite its big bang transformation into a defense superpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, Europe’s leaders now have the motivation and the means to save Ukraine and stop Putin. As Starmer put it, they are at a “crossroads in our history.” It is now up to them to lead the free world through this crucial moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RUSI’s Maritime Sanctions Taskforce first convened in November 2024, to assess the threats posed by Russia’s circumvention of maritime sanctions, in particular through its shadow fleet, and to identify enforcement priorities for G7+ partners. The findings from this inaugural meeting were reflected in the first Taskforce report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, the Taskforce held its second meeting, to examine the evolving strategies of the shadow fleet and provide operational recommendations to enhance collective enforcement efforts. The discussion addressed the shifting patterns of the shadow fleet, the need to refine designations, the importance of diplomatic engagement with flag states, and the potential leverage of international legal frameworks to strengthen maritime sanctions enforcement. This report summarises the findings and recommendations of the second Taskforce meeting, in order to inform policy decisions, enhance international coordination, and bolster the effectiveness of maritime sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributions from Taskforce members are made on an unattributable basis and this summary report does not necessarily represent the views of all Taskforce members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update-on-the-shadow-fleets-shifting-patterns&quot;&gt;Update on the Shadow Fleet’s Shifting Patterns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce began by assessing recent shifts in shadow fleet routes and operational methods. Participants highlighted that the fleet is evolving in response to ongoing enforcement measures and heightened regional coordination efforts by Nordic and Baltic states and other G7+ countries. The ability to accurately track these changes is key to ensuring the continued effectiveness of monitoring and enforcement efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the term “shadow fleet” is often used broadly, some Taskforce members distinguished three main categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cleared fleet, consisting of vessels with no suspicious activity or opaque ownership structures;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The grey fleet, comprising vessels operating within legal ambiguities and/or benefiting from weak regulatory oversight, but not necessarily violating sanctions outright;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dark fleet, which includes vessels engaged in clear illicit activity, such as deceptive shipping practices, fraudulent cargo documentation and false flagging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this categorisation, some Taskforce members shared their observations based on active tracking of the maritime domain. They noted an increase in the size of the grey fleet following the new measures introduced by the US sanctions package of 10 January 2025. The dark fleet, however, has remained relatively stable, with an estimated 1,600 vessels continuing to engage in illicit activity operations. According to some Taskforce members, the core fleet dedicated to Russia’s shadow oil trade currently comprises approximately 350 tankers without International Group of Professional and Indemnity Clubs (IGP&amp;amp;I) insurance and with opaque ownership structures. Unlike the activity of some other global shadow fleet operations, such as those servicing Iran or Venezuela, Russian vessels still need to transit strategic chokepoints such as the Danish and Turkish Straits, making it difficult for them to operate entirely unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also highlighted the emergence of new hubs for shadow fleet activity, most notably in Brazil and the Arctic Sea. Moreover, there has been a marked increase in the manipulation of Global Navigational Satellite System (GNSS) or location tampering as means of evading detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce agreed that the 10 January sanctions package had led to a significant shift in vessel behaviour. Notably, there was a sharp increase in vessels drifting in the South China Sea and a rise in ship-to-ship transfers occurring in more remote anchorage locations. These changes highlight the shadow fleet’s adaptability in response to regulatory actions and further emphasise the need for sustained vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Taskforce members from the protection and indemnity (P&amp;amp;I) insurance community commented on the recent uplift of the carriage of 2707 cargoes from Russia. Some members had observed in trade data that cargo corresponding to Harmonized System (HS) code 2707 – that is, oils and other products of the distillation of high temperature coal tar – are increasingly being reported as exports from Russia. 2707 cargoes are not subject to the Oil Price Cap (OPC), unlike oil and petroleum cargo matching codes 2709 or 2710.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-the-shadow-fleet&quot;&gt;Defining the Shadow Fleet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted that a clear definition of the shadow fleet is necessary to underpin legal and enforcement actions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) defines the shadow fleet as “ships that are engaged in illegal operations for the purposes of circumventing sanctions, evading compliance with safety or environmental regulations, avoiding insurance costs or engaging in other illegal activities, which may include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;carrying out unsafe operations which do not adhere to international regulations and well-established and strict industry standards and best practices;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;intentionally avoiding flag State and port State control inspections;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;not maintaining adequate liability insurance or other financial security;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;intentionally avoiding commercial screenings or inspections;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;not operating under a transparent corporate governance policy that assures the welfare and safety of those on board and the protection of the marine environment; or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;intentionally taking measures to avoid ship detection such as switching off their AIS [Automatic Identification System] or LRIT [long-range identification and tracking] transmissions or concealing the ship’s actual identity when there is no legitimate safety or security concern sufficient to justify such action”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lloyd’s List offers a complementary definition, categorising a tanker as part of the “dark fleet” if it is “aged 15 years or over, anonymously owned and/or has a corporate structure designed to obfuscate beneficial ownership discovery, solely deployed in sanctioned oil trades, and engaged in one or more of the deceptive shipping practices outlined in US State Department guidance issued in May 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kyiv School of Economics offers a broader definition, arguing that the shadow fleet comprises “all vessels that simultaneously meet two conditions: They lack Western insurance coverage as they rely on providers outside of the International Group of P&amp;amp;I Clubs … They are owned and managed by companies not from G7/EU countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce concluded that the IMO definition remains the most viable, as it provides a legal foundation for tracking and targeting shadow fleet activity by an internationally recognised multilateral body. A universally accepted definition will enable greater consistency of enforcement actions, reducing the risk of ambiguity and ensuring that shadow fleet vessels are subjected to uniform scrutiny across jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;refining-designations-for-maximum-impact&quot;&gt;Refining Designations for Maximum Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce debated how to refine vessel designations to ensure that sanctions remain effective while preventing unintended economic consequences. The pace of vessel designations has accelerated, with a sharp increase in deep-sea vessels designated over the past year, yet concerns persist about the clarity, consistency and long-term implications and sustainability of these designations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the Taskforce considered expanding designation targets beyond vessels towards maritime facilitators. This would explicitly exclude individual seafarers, as it was widely agreed that targeting ship crews would be ineffective and ethically questionable, since they often lack decision-making power and have little choice but to accept employment on sanctioned vessels. Instead, Taskforce members advocated for designating ship management companies (including those offering crew management and technical management services) and other intermediaries that knowingly facilitate shadow fleet activities. The decision by Chinese ports in Shandong to refuse berthing to US-sanctioned vessels just ahead of the 10 January sanctions package might signal that direct pressure on port operators could be an effective mechanism for curtailing shadow fleet activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flag registries also came under scrutiny, with some members noting that many registries remain unaware of the risks associated with accepting shadow fleet vessels. By targeting the infrastructure that supports illicit shipping, including through greater engagement with flag states and the services companies that manage many of their registries, enforcement efforts could be not only more effective, but also less disruptive to innocent parties. This is explored in greater depth below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce explored the unintended consequences of aggressively driving vessels out of regulated systems. While strict enforcement is essential, some participants warned that pushing shadow fleet vessels further into opaque, unregulated markets could exacerbate risks rather than mitigate them. When vessels lose access to legitimate insurance, classification societies and flag registries, they often resort to clandestine operations with reduced oversight, increasing the likelihood of fraudulent documentation, illicit trading and maritime safety violations. This creates a regulatory blind spot where these vessels continue to operate under even riskier conditions, heightening environmental and security concerns. The Taskforce discussed the need for a balanced approach that targets bad actors while maintaining enough oversight to prevent a complete loss of regulatory control over shadow fleet operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Taskforce members suggested the possibility of an advisory or probationary list for flag registries that demonstrate a pattern of registering vessels engaged in illicit activities, following advisories from the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and, more recently, Taiwan. While such measures would need to be carefully designed to avoid overreach, they could serve as a useful tool in encouraging higher compliance standards across the industry. However, the listing of vessels without imposing formal sanctions raised concerns among some Taskforce members, who highlighted the need for more robust and clear designation criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has demonstrated a more precise approach, providing detailed justifications for vessel listings. By contrast, the UK and the EU have relied on broader, less specific statements, often citing general involvement in the Russian oil trade without clearly outlining whether vessels have violated the OPC, are Russian-owned, or have engaged in deceptive shipping practices. Taskforce members discussed the fact that this lack of transparency creates uncertainty in the market, making it difficult for insurers, shipowners and financial institutions to determine compliance requirements and assess risk accurately. Regulators have the tools and intelligence necessary to refine this process, and greater transparency in the designation process would enable industry stakeholders to adjust their risk management frameworks accordingly and achieve stronger adherence to maritime sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key issue discussed was the potential for a structured delisting mechanism for vessels that demonstrate compliance or seek to reintegrate into legitimate trade. Some Taskforce members argued that an expedited delisting process could incentivise vessels to cease shadow fleet operations and return to the mainstream fleet, provided they meet stringent compliance criteria. The notion of allowing vessels to correct their behaviour and regain access to legitimate markets was seen as a potential means of encouraging compliance, rather than forcing vessels further into the illicit market. However, scepticism remains regarding whether such a system could be effectively implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some industry representatives expressed reluctance to reintegrate vessels that have a history of sanctions evasion. Reputable shipowners and insurers posit that vessels that have profited from sanctions violations should not be allowed to re-enter the legitimate market without significant scrutiny. Allowing such vessels to return to normal operations without facing penalties might risk encouraging others to engage in similar violations, with the expectation that they could later return to compliant trade with little consequence. This resistance from some actors in the insurance and shipping industries highlights the challenge of designing a delisting framework that balances the need for deterrence with the potential benefits of encouraging vessels back into compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-term implications of prolonged vessel designations complicate matters further. Some Taskforce members noted that, without a viable delisting mechanism, sanctioned vessels could eventually be abandoned, creating serious environmental and humanitarian hazards. When shipowners realise that their vessels are permanently excluded from the mainstream market, they may choose to scrap or neglect them, increasing the risk of oil spills, maritime accidents, and seafarer abandonment. This issue is particularly pressing given that many vessels operating within the shadow fleet are approaching or beyond the end of their operational lifespan. Without a structured means of decommissioning or scrapping these vessels, there is a growing risk of a buildup of obsolete tankers that are both environmentally hazardous and legally problematic for insurers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final consideration discussed was the need for improved collaboration between regulatory authorities and the private sector. Participants noted that in the US, the White House, the US State Department and the US Treasury Department are reportedly exploring the establishment of specialised maritime desks dedicated to addressing Russian and Iranian sanctions. Taskforce members suggested that, if these efforts materialise, a formal government–private sector partnership could prove invaluable to streamlining enforcement efforts. This would facilitate the dialogue between policymakers and industry experts, with a partnership that could improve information sharing, enhance due diligence processes, and develop more effective strategies for addressing illicit shipping practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengthening-engagement-with-flag-states&quot;&gt;Strengthening Engagement with Flag States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, the Taskforce agreed that engagement with flag states remains a critical element in enforcing maritime sanctions and limiting the operations of the shadow fleet. Flag states enable vessels to operate internationally, granting them the necessary legal status to navigate global waters. This makes them a pivotal point of leverage for policymakers seeking to reinforce compliance measures. While flag states retain sovereign control over their registries, participants noted that many remain unaware of the reputational risks associated with facilitating illicit shipping activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between flag states and their registries varies considerably, which influences how receptive flag states are to diplomatic engagement. Some countries, such as Panama, for example, maintain direct governmental oversight of their registries, integrating them into national maritime policy and economic strategy. Others, such as Gabon, outsource their registries to private entities (in the case of Gabon, located in the UAE) that operate with minimal governmental involvement. Panama, the world’s second-largest flag registry, has demonstrated a willingness to enhance compliance measures following leadership changes and strategic diplomatic outreach, leading to the deregistration of several sanctioned vessels. Liberia, the world’s largest registry, has also engaged in constructive discussions with enforcement authorities, and participants shared that the country is in the process of formalising a memorandum of understanding with the UK to bolster transparency and cooperation in flagging policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to government officials, the UK’s diplomatic approach has prioritised what is commonly referred to as “carrot and stick” diplomacy, with a strong emphasis on incentives rather than just on coercion. This strategy involves understanding the economic aspirations of flag states and their strategic interests within the IMO. Recognising that many flag states do not explicitly align themselves with Western geopolitical interests, UK officials have instead focused on highlighting the long-term economic and reputational benefits of maintaining high compliance standards. Flag registries that cultivate a reputation for professionalism and reliability stand to gain broader access to mainstream shipping markets, whereas those associated with illicit activities risk being marginalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Taskforce members added that a key aspect of this progress has been leveraging competition between flag registries. Countries such as Panama and Liberia compete vigorously for market share in the global registry business. This rivalry presents an opportunity to encourage better regulatory standards, as each seeks to position itself as the preferred choice for legitimate shipowners. For instance, Panama’s decision to deregister vessels associated with the Russian shadow fleet was influenced in part by concerns about being outflanked by Liberia in the registry business, according to participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, engagement has yielded mixed results with newer registries that have emerged as key enablers of shadow fleet operations. Gabon, for instance, has played an increasingly prominent role in registering Russian-linked vessels, particularly following the delisting of Sovcomflot tankers in Liberia. The Gabonese registry began registering Russian oil tankers in late 2023, rapidly expanding its presence in the shadow fleet sector. Diplomatic efforts have focused on encouraging Gabon to reconsider its role in facilitating illicit shipping, and there have been some positive signals, though results remain inconclusive. Similarly, Cameroon’s registry has been identified as a growing concern, requiring further engagement to determine whether it can be persuaded to adopt stronger compliance measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the economic incentives for some flag states to maintain lax oversight remain a significant barrier to enforcement. Many registries derive substantial revenue from vessel registrations and are hesitant to impose stricter controls that could deter business. Addressing this challenge requires a multifaceted approach that not only emphasises reputational risks but also explores ways to provide alternative economic incentives for compliance. Thus, the Taskforce agreed that one of the key lessons from diplomatic engagement has been the effectiveness of framing discussions around environmental and safety concerns, rather than directly addressing the shadow fleet. Flag states often respond more positively to arguments highlighting the risks posed by substandard vessels to marine ecosystems and maritime safety than to discussions explicitly tied to sanctions enforcement. This approach has proven particularly useful in encouraging deregistration efforts, as flag states can justify compliance actions based on broader regulatory concerns, rather than on political alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another critical aspect of flag state engagement involves the interconnected nature of regulatory enforcement. Flag registries do not operate in isolation, but are part of a broader ecosystem that includes insurers, classification societies and financial institutions. Taskforce members discussed the diplomatic engagement which has sought to connect these dots, ensuring that actions taken against shadow fleet vessels trigger cascading consequences that reinforce compliance across multiple sectors. For instance, vessels that lose their flag status often face difficulties securing insurance and financing, creating a compounding effect that increases the cost of illicit operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite progress in some areas, the rapid reflagging of shadow fleet vessels from one jurisdiction to another underscores the adaptability of illicit operators. Participants agreed that efforts to deregister sanctioned vessels must be accompanied by measures to prevent them from simply shifting to another accommodating flag. This “Whac-a-Mole” dynamic highlights the need for sustained engagement and ongoing monitoring to ensure that flag states do not simply replace deregistered vessels with new ones linked to the same illicit networks. Moving forward, G7+ partners must continue strengthening partnerships with flag states that have demonstrated a commitment to compliance, while increasing pressure on non-cooperative registries to achieve impactful measures against the shadow fleet’s illicit shipping activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leveraging-international-frameworks-and-institutions&quot;&gt;Leveraging International Frameworks and Institutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce examined the role of existing international frameworks in addressing the challenges posed by the shadow fleet, with a particular focus on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Participants emphasised that any enforcement measures must align with the rules-based international order to maintain legitimacy and avoid unintended consequences. However, discussions underscored the growing complexity of applying traditional legal instruments to contemporary threats, particularly as other states are increasingly weaponising vessels in hybrid warfare and ignoring longstanding global norms and standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key concern was the legal interpretation of UNCLOS, which enshrines fundamental principles such as innocent passage and transit rights through international straits. These rights are not contingent upon a vessel’s ownership structure, insurance status or compliance history, posing a challenge for enforcement efforts. Some Taskforce members argued that a rigid interpretation of UNCLOS limits the ability of states to respond to emerging security threats – particularly as adversarial actors exploit these provisions to evade scrutiny – and argued for an evolution of international law and standards. Others cautioned against attempts to stretch UNCLOS beyond its intended scope, warning that such actions could establish precedents that adversarial states might use to justify their own violations of international maritime law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, sanctions enforcement – particularly when not resulting from a decision at the UN – remains outside the explicit remit of UNCLOS, as such action is inherently a political tool wielded by individual states, rather than a globally mandated mechanism. Some participants stressed that attempts to use UNCLOS as an enforcement vehicle for sanctions could undermine its credibility, particularly given that the convention was not designed to regulate economic restrictions. Others pointed out that while direct sanctions enforcement is not within UNCLOS’s scope, broader principles of maritime security and environmental protection could be leveraged to address the shadow fleet’s activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing use of civilian vessels in hybrid warfare adds another layer of complexity. Recent instances of suspected undersea cable sabotage, potentially linked to shadow fleet operations, have heightened concerns about maritime security. While the deliberate severing of cables constitutes a hostile act, proving intent remains challenging. Representatives from the P&amp;amp;I community noted that cable-severing incidents are common, with accidental damage occurring regularly due to anchor drags and fishing activity. The challenge, therefore, lies in distinguishing between genuine accidents and deliberate acts of aggression. Existing conventions, such as the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables, were not designed to address such hybrid threats. Under this framework, if a country discovers a Russian vessel interfering with cables, the prescribed legal procedure involves collecting evidence and referring the matter to Russia for action – an entirely unrealistic scenario given current geopolitical tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This legal ambiguity presents a dilemma: while enforcement efforts must remain within established legal frameworks, the existing conventions do not adequately address emerging threats. The Taskforce debated whether it would be possible to introduce an evolutionary interpretation of UNCLOS, incorporating evolving security concerns. Some Taskforce members argued that, under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the interpretation of international law can be dynamic. Indeed, UNCLOS provisions have been revisited in other contexts, such as environmental protection, to reflect new developments. However, others stressed the risks of this approach, warning that novel legal interpretations could invite retaliatory actions from states that might also exploit such precedents for their own strategic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related challenge identified by the Taskforce was the lack of transparency in flag state oversight of vessel insurance. Many designated vessels do not publicly disclose their insurance coverage, relying instead on self-reported compliance. This raises significant concerns, as incidents, such as the Alpha I tanker spill in Greece, have demonstrated the risks of inadequate insurance coverage for sanctioned vessels. IMO guidelines on insurance disclosures remain non-mandatory, and efforts to strengthen these regulations have met resistance from certain flag states. Participants debated whether the IMO could be leveraged to introduce stronger disclosure requirements for tanker insurance, compelling insurers to provide verifiable information on capital adequacy and financial transparency. This, in turn, could improve risk assessment and reduce the likelihood of uninsured vessels causing environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the use of the IMO as a sanctions-enforcement tool remains controversial. Some Taskforce members emphasised that the IMO is a maritime safety and environmental protection body, not a sanctions-enforcement agency. Others argued that while the IMO should not be co-opted for political objectives, there is scope to use its regulatory mechanisms to address risks that overlap with the shadow fleet’s activities. Empowering the IMO to strengthen transparency requirements for insurance and flag state oversight could directly contribute to enforcement efforts without explicitly linking them to sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exploring-hard-security-responses&quot;&gt;Exploring Hard Security Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond legal and institutional frameworks, the Taskforce also explored the potential role of military partnerships in addressing the shadow fleet. The Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF), a UK-led coalition consisting predominantly of Nordic and Baltic states, was identified as a potential enforcement tool. Unlike NATO, which requires consensus for action, the JEF can operate with the agreement of just two member states, making it a more flexible mechanism for targeted interventions. Given that JEF states oversee key Russian oil export routes, including the Arctic, Baltic and Nordic straits, the English Channel and even the Strait of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal (due to the presence of UK overseas bases in Gibraltar and Cyprus), the coalition is well-positioned to monitor and report on shadow fleet activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce considered how the JEF could be leveraged to enhance maritime domain awareness, which remains suboptimal in many countries that are overly reliant on AIS tracking, which shadow fleet vessels frequently manipulate to evade detection. While military interdiction of vessels remains a highly sensitive issue, the JEF’s role as an intelligence-gathering and monitoring entity could prove valuable. There was discussion about whether the JEF could conduct targeted surveillance operations, tracking sanctioned vessels and sharing intelligence with enforcement authorities. Another proposal involved the possibility of JEF vessels shadowing shadow fleet ships, demonstrating a deterrent presence without direct intervention. However, the legal and political implications of such actions would need to be carefully considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce concluded that while international legal frameworks such as UNCLOS and the IMO remain foundational to maritime governance, they are not sufficient in isolation to address the complexities of the shadow fleet. A combination of diplomatic engagement, regulatory refinement, enhanced intelligence sharing and military deterrence will be necessary to curtail Russia’s shadow fleet illicit maritime activities. However, any enforcement strategy must carefully navigate the legal and political constraints inherent in the international maritime system to avoid unintended repercussions that could undermine broader maritime trade and security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-the-trump-administration&quot;&gt;Implications of the Trump Administration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the geopolitical landscape continues to evolve, the Taskforce discussed the potential ramifications of the new US administration for maritime sanctions enforcement. Given the significant role the US plays in global sanctions enforcement, any policy changes under the second Trump presidency could have wide-reaching consequences for the shadow fleet, Russian oil trade, and broader energy markets. Taskforce members also anticipated a greater focus on the Iranian shadow fleet, something all felt should be a focus of a future Taskforce meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some speculated that a change in leadership might lead to a weakening of sanctions enforcement against Russia, recent indications suggest that President Donald Trump may maintain and even tighten Russian sanctions, at least in the short term, particularly if they align with broader strategic objectives, such as controlling oil prices. Trump has made statements linking oil prices to the longevity of Russia’s war in Ukraine, arguing that lower oil revenues would exert financial pressure on Moscow and potentially shorten the conflict. Unlike previous approaches that primarily targeted individual vessels and owners, some Taskforce members argued that a more assertive enforcement strategy could involve placing pressure on the key infrastructure facilitating sanctioned oil trade, including ports, refineries and intermediaries in third countries. However, it remains unclear whether this strategy would be as effective against Russian oil trade as it has been with Iran, given the complexities of and evasion opportunities presented by the OPC and the diverse range of non-aligned countries willing to continue purchasing Russian crude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the US reassesses its foreign policy priorities in the coming months, close monitoring of policy statements and enforcement actions – particularly a greater focus on Iran – will be essential for anticipating the next phase of sanctions strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce identified a number of actions to strengthen maritime sanctions and enhance their enforcement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refine designations:&lt;/strong&gt; G7+ authorities should continue targeting shadow fleet vessels and key maritime facilitators and related infrastructure. To enhance compliance and enforcement effectiveness, designations should include specific criteria, such as breaching the OPC, ownership links to sanctioned entities, or engagement in deceptive shipping practices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expedite delisting for compliant vessels:&lt;/strong&gt; While strict enforcement remains a priority, authorities should facilitate delisting for vessels that demonstrate a commitment to compliance, provided they meet stringent regulatory conditions. Suspicious vessels should remain designated to prevent abuse of the delisting process. Such a system would incentivise behavioural change while mitigating risks of entrenching the shadow fleet’s parallel trade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grant licenses to safely scrap sanctioned tankers:&lt;/strong&gt; Designated vessels that are past their operational life expectancy and have deteriorated are at risk of being neglected or abandoned, as they cannot be disposed of in a safe manner due to both a lack of adequate insurance and sanctions-related barriers. The G7+ should explore the introduction of a pooled insurance scheme or licensing regime to enable the navigation of listed vessels to scrappage facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance flag state engagement:&lt;/strong&gt; Diplomatic efforts should frame compliance as an environmental and safety issue to encourage deregistration of sanctioned vessels. As larger registries take steps against the shadow fleet, further engagement with high-risk registries such as those of Gabon and Cameroon should be prioritised to limit their role in facilitating illicit operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance maritime insurance oversight:&lt;/strong&gt; Authorities should mandate greater transparency in maritime insurance documentation, ensuring that insurers operating outside the IGP&amp;amp;I adhere to clear financial and compliance standards. The IMO should strengthen guidelines requiring public disclosure of insurance to mitigate environmental risks associated with shadow fleet operations by ensuring that vessels maintain adequate liability coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage international frameworks to strengthen sanctions enforcement:&lt;/strong&gt; Enforcement measures should align with existing international legal frameworks such as UNCLOS, while remaining effective in addressing contemporary security challenges such as hybrid warfare, shadow fleet activities and emerging security threats. While sanctions are not explicitly covered under UNCLOS, broader maritime security and environmental protection provisions can be utilised to enhance regulatory oversight. The IMO should be engaged to improve insurance transparency and flag state due diligence requirements. However, attempts to stretch UNCLOS beyond its intended scope should be approached cautiously, to avoid setting precedents that adversarial states could exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand regional cooperation and maritime surveillance:&lt;/strong&gt; The JEF presents an opportunity for coordinated and enhanced targeted monitoring of shadow fleet activities. Expanding and following the example of the JEF’s role in monitoring shadow fleet movements, reporting sanctions violations, and deterring illicit activity through strategic presence could bolster existing enforcement mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor policy shifts in the US:&lt;/strong&gt; G7+ partners must monitor policy shifts under the new US administration and ensure alignment in enforcement strategies. While initial indications suggest that Trump may maintain Russian sanctions for now, potential changes in enforcement tactics could have significant implications. An expansion of sanctions activity against Iran and its oil export industry should also be anticipated. Proactive engagement with US policymakers will be essential to maintaining coordination and preventing enforcement gaps that could be exploited by the shadow fleet and its enablers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second meeting of the RUSI Maritime Sanctions Taskforce reinforced the importance of adaptive enforcement measures to counter Russia’s evolving circumvention tactics. While progress has been made on designations and flag state engagement, further refinement is needed to ensure sanctions remain effective without creating unintended consequences. Strengthening diplomatic engagement, leveraging international frameworks, and ensuring greater clarity in enforcement actions will be key to maintaining pressure on Russia’s shadow fleet while upholding the integrity of global maritime regulations. The Taskforce will continue to monitor developments – including an anticipated increase in focus from the new US administration on Iranian targets – and provide recommendations to enhance collective efforts in tackling maritime sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

However, internal security threats, transborder insurgencies, ethnic marginalization, and economic challenges reveal underlying instability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security governance is a broad subject ranging from security sector reform and human security to nonmilitary aspects of statecraft. Most discourse on the important dimension of governance, however, is at the international level and dictated by international norms. When it comes to Ghana, the typical question is: Does Ghana have a security problem? If so, how serious is it and what regional implications does it have? These concepts are most relevant when defined in practical terms at the citizen level, where they translate into civil-military relations. Instead of asking if Ghana has a security problem, policymakers should ask: Do Ghanaians feel safe? If not, then Ghana needs better security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, Ghana remains an important security and economic partner because of its political leverage over its West African neighbors. Developments in Ghana matter due to the threats they represent for the region, such as the recent rise in political violence, trafficking, and insecurity in urban centers and along the northern borders with Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, and Togo. Ghana’s weakened state of governance and the politicization of its military have created the type of conditions seen in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso before terrorist organizations overran those countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is based on field research conducted in Accra and Tamale, Ghana, in March 2024. At the request of the interviewees, the researchers have kept the comments in this report anonymous. To conduct this study, the researchers met with a broad cross-section of civil society leaders representing youth, women, and various ethnic and regional groups; independent journalists; local political and security analysts and academics; military officers; and international diplomats and representatives of international organizations based in Accra and Tamale. Many respondents were not originally from Accra or Tamale, so they shared experiences and observations of life outside the capital in zones directly affected by insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By law, Ghana is a unitary state, but in practice it is far from that. The country has a national constitution, which is the source of national institutions such as the military, police, and legal system. As Ghana is a pluralistic nation, these institutions do not suit everyone, especially not recently, given several alarming developments such as the chieftaincy conflict in Bawku in the upper east region. Ghana is a democracy, but the democratic system and process have been tested in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ghana most people know enjoys a very positive image and deservingly so. It is home to a conference center for international peacekeeping and regional cultural preservation. A destination for well-heeled diaspora tourists, Ghana projects confidence, cultural prowess, and clout as a pioneer of Pan-Africanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political pundits and security analysts see Ghana as a stalwart for stability. In an area increasingly threatened by violent extremism, coups d’états, and political tyrants, it is one of the few democratic countries that has consistently seen the peaceful transfer of power over the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghana has an illustrious military history. Ghanaians took on leadership roles during the deployment of peace support operations by the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) into Sierra Leone and Liberia. Ghana is also an important troop contributor to UN peacekeeping operations. Ghanaian troops participated in UN operations during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and in the peacekeeping and stabilization operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo over the last two decades. The U.S. military’s decision to integrate Ghana into interregional and international military exercises, such as Flintlock, has underscored Ghana’s reputation as an important security actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists recognize Ghana as a regional powerhouse that attracts workers from across the region to its flourishing agri-business and mining industries. Despite conflicts over land management, particularly with farmers and pastoralists across the northern regions of the country, Ghana appears to manage the problem without provoking ethnic or political violence. And yet, behind the veneer, Ghana faces considerable challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international community increasingly looks to Ghana for regional leadership in a neighborhood where coups d’états and autocracy are gaining ground. Recognizing the longevity of Ghana’s democratic institutions, international leaders sometimes turn a blind eye to human rights irregularities or write blank checks. In 2023, Ghana cashed in on its credibility by convincing creditors to bank there even after its banks defaulted in late 2022 and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had to float Ghana’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists and political allies fear, perhaps rightly, that IMF and World Bank funds might be diverted to political campaign ventures rather than provide desperately needed support for jobs and the education and health sectors. Shortly after the January 2020 election, President Nana Akufo-Addo pledged to “build a cathedral to glory and God” for granting his party, the New Patriotic Party (NPP), victory in the elections, but the project stalled due to lack of funds. The announcement in 2023 that the cash-strapped state would move ahead with building the $400 million state-funded cathedral confirmed fears that campaign strategy, not economics, would dictate government spending until Ghana holds its next presidential election in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As average Ghanaians struggle to make ends meet and officials make off with millions, the government is having difficulty convincing Ghanaians that it operates in the public’s interest. The population also questions the soundness of the IMF’s actions, which it sees as enabling government mismanagement. In December 2024, Ghanaians asserted their need for change by re-electing President John Dramani Mahama over the incumbent vice president, Mahamudu Bawumia. Mahama’s victory is attributed to dissatisfaction with the incumbent government’s handling of economic issues and Mahama’s campaign promise to renegotiate the $3 billion IMF bailout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, Ghana is an unwitting host to networks of smuggling rings. As in most countries, Ghana has porous international borders. Criminal networks exploit weak border controls to move people, weapons, tobacco, vehicles, cashews, stolen cattle, cocoa, and timber into or across the country. These so-called trades finance the activities of criminal groups in border areas, especially illegal mining, truck theft, fuel theft, drug trafficking, human trafficking, and above all the theft of cattle in neighboring countries to sell in northern Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Profits from these trades also allegedly fall into the hands of violent extremist organizations (VEOs) operating in Burkina Faso, Niger, and Togo. An umbrella coalition of al Qaeda–aligned groups known as Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wa al-Muslimeen ( JNIM) has aligned with criminal networks involved in the movement of legal and illegal goods. While the incidence of terrorism and the number of Ghanaians involved in terrorist activities were relatively low as of 2024, the growing appeal of international terrorist groups and the increasing exposure of Ghanaians to these groups point to a possible terrorist threat in Ghana. The situation in the northern border areas is becoming more tense and the populations more radicalized, especially due to social media, which increasingly spreads propaganda and calls to destabilize Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidents of political violence in Ghana, along with traditional ethnic and chieftaincy-related violence, underscore how using violence for political ends is becoming increasingly acceptable in Ghana. Recent years have seen an increase in violence related to land disputes and local and district-level elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of a Western diplomat, “Ghana has been spared terrorism but not violent extremism.” There is a commonly expressed fear that violent extremist groups could team up with disaffected community members in northern Ghana desperate for security governance dialogue and establish a parallel security protocol based on an exchange of services, information, and cooperation. To some degree, such arrangements already exist among the networks of smugglers and VEOs that operate in the northern border areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These networks have grown, in part, due to a normative environment in which local communities accept organized crime by situating it within a cultural ethos and the social welfare roles criminals play. Such norms develop unfettered due to the lack of government presence and control in these areas. These spaces are not ungoverned but rather undergoverned, with inadequate civil and security personnel to reverse the trends that have been developing for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much attention focuses on the north, Ghana also faces the growing threat of insecurity in urban centers. Despite official rhetoric on external challenges to the country’s security—such as cross-border crime, illegal arms trafficking, and the instability in neighboring Côte d’Ivoire—qualitative research shows that these concerns are dwarfed by concerns about everyday violence. For most Ghanaians, the main threats to their security are domestic violence, crime, food insecurity, poverty, disease, environmental degradation, and the erosion of the quality of state institutions. The state is failing in its duty as the “ultimate provider” of these dimensions of security—namely, economic security, physical security, environmental security, social security, and personal security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this failure is the antiquated colonial lens through which security forces preserve establishment interests and a narrow vision of the state. Rather than serve the welfare of all citizens, a ruling elite has captured the state for their own enrichment, and security is available only to those who can afford it. Such an attitude has triggered a widely repeated public discourse, mainly through social media, that discredits democratic institutions and governments and calls for an alternative system bordering on populism to address public grievances. In short, the threat of insecurity is much more diverse and politically sensitive than commonly acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to discussions with diplomats, security experts, and civil society organizations (CSOs) in the capital and upper provinces, Ghana is on the edge of a political and security crisis that it is ill-suited and ill-prepared to manage—in large part because it does not have an integrated mechanism to unite all actors in making Ghana a safer place to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security plays a pivotal role in enhancing economic development. The safer people feel, the greater the chances they will invest in economic ventures that expand socioeconomic activities and overall trust and confidence. Facing these threats would involve concerted efforts from the government and international community, with Ghanaian citizens taking the lead on identifying ways to manage fragile areas in need of security reform and protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security governance is more art than science, and no approach can claim to produce infallible results. However, whether a top-down institutional approach or a more organic bottom-up approach, nearly all approaches include some version of real or even perceived influence of civilians over government security policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big-picture security governance should strengthen state-society relations and enable participatory and inclusive security measures at the community level. An unavoidable component is the public image of the government’s approach. In Ghana, TikTok and Facebook content creators drive much of the political-social discourse. The combined influence of citizens’ legitimate concerns and a barrage of fake news and messages to manipulate public opinion against the state have placed Ghana’s democracy in the crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-recipe-for-safety&quot;&gt;A Recipe for Safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a visit to Ghana in February 2024, a short ride from the hotel to the center of Accra inspired a discussion on feelings of safety. “I don’t feel safe,” said Frank, the middle-aged Uber driver, “because the politicians are in control of the security apparatus, and they don’t care about me or my interests. They only look out for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Ghanaians feel the same way. A common notion is that Ghana’s social contract with its citizenry is missing a clause on citizen safety. Fortunately, public concerns have not gone unnoticed. The Ghanaian government is aware of its shortcomings in meeting citizens’ expectations. Over the past two decades, with donor support, it has laid out programs to increase public participation in developing its security strategies, including various forms of community policing to allay concerns and build trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the security governance system continues to suffer from an identity crisis due to the plurality of citizens’ backgrounds and experiences. Citizens feel less concerned with the state’s agenda to keep people safe and have prioritized their own security agendas. Security strategies vary across the country, from impromptu night patrols by village youths to more organized state-recognized militias. Local security groups are not strictly a response to the lack of state effectiveness. Some are linked to precolonial systems that were never disbanded, and their existence continues due to the lack of a better system to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many Ghanaian urban centers, civilian policing groups known as “Watch Dogs” attend to their own security and justice needs. Reliance on vigilante justice is not unique to Ghana; in urban centers across Africa, residents resort to community policing groups to meet their security needs. These entities typically emerge in a security vacuum when state-sanctioned security forces cannot provide security to the community’s satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few African states, public policing has not fully displaced other forms of Indigenous policing systems in the postcolonial era. The endurance of some of these Indigenous policing groups has been driven partly by internal dynamics, including the flexibility of civilian policing groups, the way these groups understand and address security concerns, and their sensitivity to local justice and security. Externally, the endurance of civilian policing groups has been sustained, in part, by the rollback of the state through structural adjustment programs. State support for Watch Dogs in some communities is partly a way to address local security needs while meeting local satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most visible program—the Community Policing Unit—unfolded in 2002, giving rise to somewhat controversial neighborhood watch committees (NWCs). The success of NWCs hinges on the notion that people who live and work in a neighborhood are best suited to understand their area’s resources, problems, and needs. The move was controversial because it led to the formal emergence of Watch Dogs, which sometimes became judge and jury in their communities and were allegedly responsible for human rights abuses. The Watch Dog title has been used to describe a broad range of community-based security units, from traditional security forces and informal patrol groups to more proactive trained units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghana’s statutory legal framework promotes the codification and application of various forms of customary law but does not authorize traditional security systems to administer punishment beyond certain misdemeanors. The result is that some residents view these traditional security systems as weakened, judging them as lame and unattractive, as many local youths seek more aggressive action to establish order and mete out local justice. Hence, they see appeal in the Watch Dogs, which are formally licensed by police and receive some level of training and equipment. In 2023, security analysts warned that some Watch Dogs had begun to receive military-grade weapons and training to act as supports to existing security forces on the ground but without formal incorporation into the security hierarchy or recognized accountability for their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the support of the German Agency for International Development (GIZ), the Ghana Police Service (GPS) launched the Enhanced Visibility and Community Policing Strategy in late 2022. The program builds on past community policing experiences to enhance police operations. But instead of relying on a civilian force, the program enlists professional police officers to establish rapport with residents by assigning units to patrol at-risk neighborhoods. The strongest benefit to this approach is that it reinforces the image of the state while including local stakeholders in developing security and crime prevention plans in their respective jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the format of the program emphasizes the right areas and warrants support, civil society actors call the program poorly planned. The approach is designed to circumvent some shortcomings of the traditional community policing models, but it fails to achieve the same level of presence. Despite attempts by the police administration to establish permanent police posts in some areas, the lack of accommodation has created an ad hoc police presence and frequent turnover of officers allocated to these posts. Because they are not permanently stationed, officers have had difficulty establishing trust with the community. Consequently, police units continue to experience conflict with residents who feel officers are not adequately performing their duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;citizen-justice&quot;&gt;Citizen Justice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unsatiable Expectations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citizens of Ghana, like those of other West African countries, have long entrusted their security to local entities. These include community-borne safety groups, over which citizens have greater control and in which they have placed their trust to intervene in the local interest. Citizens do not see the national security apparatus as subject to public or citizen control or oversight. Importantly, they do not expect that the state will ensure their safety. That lack of expectation, which has roots in the colonial past, continues to undermine security governance in Ghana today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gap between citizens’ expectations and what security forces can do legally is a major issue for African democracies. In absolute terms, security forces cannot fulfill their mandates and appear effective without citizens’ approval and consent. The legitimacy of security forces depends on citizens’ satisfaction with their performance, their level of accountability, and how well they adhere to procedural rules when interacting with citizens. In theory, when the public perceives the police as effective, they will defer to the police’s authority and directives and feel safer because of the services the police provide. In short, a responsive security service can be a good measure of governance, democracy, and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem emerges when public calls for street justice do not respect the rule of law and due process that police are required to follow. Civilian control is not about giving absolute power to civilians on all security-related matters but rather creating a system of checks and balances to ensure accountability of the security sector in the interests of both the state and communities. The security sector needs and should retain a degree of autonomy in internal operational matters to prevent the politicization of the security sector in the service of political interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police are the first, and often the only, point of contact Ghanaians have with the criminal justice system. Unfortunately, these interactions are marred by widespread corruption, illegal arrest and detention, excessive use of force, and a failure to respond to complaints, which are hallmarks of a regime-style police force unaccountable for its actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of national security in the context of Ghana—and indeed the rest of the former British colonies in West Africa—largely focused on the internal public order imperatives of the colonial state, with a secondary emphasis on suppressing “anti-imperial” threats—notably, nationalist agitations. The armed forces had been recruited largely to cope with the internal threat to the public order and colonial state posed by the Indigenes, whose initial hostility to British rule had been over land expropriation issues and resistance to taxes. The police and army, therefore, began as constabulary forces geared toward repressing insurrection, preventing civil violence, and managing rural disorder, rather than as traditional security forces. Indeed, the police force was designed to hold the people down at the least cost to the colonial administration. Mounting pressure for more African participation in the lower rungs of the colonial state led to the recruitment of a handful of locals into the police force. Only during World War II did the state take more meaningful strides toward developing a select local cadre of the officer class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since colonial times, the structure of the Ghanaian security forces has changed little. Ghanaians still see them primarily as an apparatus for protecting the ruling elite instead of the people of Ghana. Today, security institutions such as the military and police continue to see themselves as the source of power, which they have retained for the past six decades and are not in the least interested in relinquishing. Public hearings on security matters are not broadcast on television, and transcripts of these hearings are not available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low public opinion, corrupt recruitment practices, and underequipped forces have been at the core of low morale within the police. While the GPS recognizes the misconduct that has garnered its poor reputation and low public trust, it is attempting to repair its public face. For instance, as part of the “See Something, Say Something” public safety campaign, authorities are more willing, open, and available to meet with CSOs. But these conversations and platforms are few and far between, and civil society representatives cannot determine whether authorities have accepted their feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police inspector general has been engaging with youths, going to schools to help them understand the role of defense and security institutions and bridging the gap between these institutions and the population. While the inspector general is popular and seen as a reformist, the public views the police as corrupt and not open to change. As one analyst put it, “In fact, to the populations, even the See Something, Say Something campaign is seen as a contradiction, given the mistrust between the citizens and the police, which often brutalizes and prevents the people from exercising their civic rights.” In the words of a security analyst, “Police officers are a nuisance when you do not need them and useless when you need them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police headquarters in Accra recently revamped its appearance, purchasing new vehicles and creating training protocols to boost professionalism in the police force. However, the shortage of materials leaves police feeling ill prepared and outgunned in neighborhoods where they are needed most. In a recent study, police rank and file complained about patrolling vast areas on foot without bulletproof vests or other protective equipment. Another formidable obstacle is alleged political influence on recruitment practices, wherein politicians fast-track recruitment of urban or rural youth into the police and military to help shore up support for a particular candidate. The recruitment process ensures that the recruits essentially become untouchable and unaccountable to the internal hierarchy, rendering a portion of the police force unmanageable, untrainable, and undisciplined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in many parts of the world, security in Ghana is a salient and critical issue requiring the proper governance of the state to maintain peace and prevent threats to the lives and properties of its citizenry. The police, for now, appear to be a dead end when it comes to concerted, effective security governance efforts, especially along Ghana’s northern borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-potential-way-forward&quot;&gt;A Potential Way Forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facilitated Civilian-Military Partnerships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on discussions with security entities, citizens, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and CSOs, the Ghanaian military holds a greater level of public trust today than the police and other security forces. The public sees the military as an entity that can get the job done. When faced with a security threat, most Ghanaians trust the military to remove the threat effectively. However, that trust has allowed the military’s presence to spill over into areas that are traditionally public or civilian domains, such as providing close protection for high-profile individuals, escorting bank armored vehicles, and even overseeing crowd control for public and political events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments may deploy the military to perform internal security duties to bolster the tasks of the police service in terms of logistics. During the colonial era in Ghana, the military was employed in various operations to quell disturbances and riots, meaning its historical roots are intertwined with the maintenance of internal security. However, more recently, deployment of the military has been associated with compensating for the lack of effectiveness and inefficiency of police units to fulfill tasks and meet public and private expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice of combining military and police functions has inherent dangers. For this reason, upon attaining independence, Ghanaian leaders enacted a law that regulated the presence and conduct of the military employed in performing internal security functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the remarkable democratic changes that have reshaped Ghana over the past three decades, its defense and security institutions, including the military, have not changed much regarding civil-military relations, which are driven by both trust and fear. Ghanaians see the military as serving politicians who prefer the status quo, which allows them to co-opt the armed forces for their political agenda. In other words, political alternance has not necessarily brought change, as ruling parties instrumentalize the security apparatus to their benefit, setting off a vicious cycle. As a result, there is no real civilian oversight or demand for accountability and transparency. In recent years, civilian trust in the military has also eroded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in 2021, the military stormed the parliament during a vote for speaker, shocking and terrifying the population. But to date, there has been no public hearing on the matter. In a way, this is a consequence of the normalization of military involvement in domestic affairs. In 2020, the armed forces were deployed to secure the elections, further feeding the belief that they were protecting the interests of the ruling party. There have been violent encounters between military officers and civilians. In one case, an officer was killed in a community targeted by the military after an officer’s mobile telephone was stolen and several people were arrested. These incidents will continue as long as the armed forces undertake law enforcement activities. Sustained and strong civilian oversight of these institutions is the most efficient way to dial back on these deployments and one of the pillars of positive civil-military relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Ghana establishes the framework for security agency operations and demarcates the roles of the military and those of the police, among other security agencies. However, the constitution also states clearly that the armed forces shall be equipped and maintained to perform their role of defending Ghana as well as performing other functions for the development of Ghana as the president may determine—a considerable window for a diversity of tasks and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most countries, the military is one of the most respected institutions. Using the military in roles that it has not been trained for and that are not prescribed by its doctrine can erode the respect it enjoys from the citizenry. In the long term, this erosion can threaten the foundation of the military as an institution. For these reasons, most political pundits recommend that Ghana restrict the military’s role and establish a paramilitary unit to assist the police in law enforcement. Allowing the military to serve in internal security operations will have detrimental effects on civilian policing, professionalization of the military, and national security. The loyalty of the military—and for that matter of the defense and security institutions—is not to the central government as such but to the established government as a political authority. Thus, the military’s duties should not extend to internal security except in circumstances of last resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghanaian citizens may be grateful for their military stepping in to stabilize a dangerous civil disorder, and the military may perform this intervening role in a responsible and respectful manner. But its presence undermines the nation’s foundations of civilian control through a secret chain of martial command and accountability. Converting military capabilities to policing functions will have severe implications for the nation’s democratization process and for the military itself, especially as Ghana enters another electoral phase in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largely amiable relationship between the military and society may present an opportunity for an enduring and positive civilian-military dialogue in Ghana. The generally uncritical attitude civilians have toward the military may provide openings for local protocols or strategies for soldiers and the civilians they are meant to protect. Civil-military committees (CMCs) were designed as platforms for the military and civilians to exchange information and air grievances. Unfortunately, CMCs have been overly centralized and instrumentalized to impose political agendas rather than allow citizen feedback that could revolutionize information processing in remote sensitive areas of the country and stabilize violent regions such as in the upper east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last three decades, Ghana has undertaken governance reforms to improve the performance of its governing institutions. These reforms include modernization of the legal and judicial systems, decentralization of certain aspects of governance, and efforts to control corruption, among others. However, the citizen-military relations (CMR) institutional framework remains largely unaltered. Ghana has no legal provisions regarding CMR. Although the constitution mentions the armed forces in various places, it does not impose specific regulations on their relationship with civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMCs represent an opportunity to address the diversity of challenges and approaches to security governance with salient issues in each geographic area dictating concrete action. Unfortunately, CMCs in Ghana face several challenges. First, the administrative system is overcentralized, which weakens local committees’ ability to operate effectively. Second, the political environment in Ghana is heavily partisan. Government and opposition politicians sometimes use the military to advance their own political interests. In such a political environment, CMCs struggle to function independently and appear as neutral bodies. Third, the functions of CMCs are unclear. Most people think CMCs just implement government policy at the local level. Consequently, they sometimes see the military as an institution that implements policy instead of having direct input into policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bilateral support for developing functional CMCs should clarify Ghana’s internal policy on incorporating active-duty military into programming that encourages understanding between civilians and the military. Considering Ghana’s history of political recruits, donors must insist on vetting military participants to ensure they are willing partners in the process and not subject to political influence or a history of disciplinary issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, CMR programs have fizzled out because they lack proper timing or urgency or they have been overly focused on subjecting the military to civilian rule and management. CSOs have expressed the need for training to understand the role they could play in revitalizing CMCs by convening citizens and military in a neutral, apolitical environment to discuss local security concerns and steps forward. Bilateral support from donors for this process may help increase NGOs’ and CSOs’ understanding of the roles and limitations of civil and military control and introduce civilian police entities, wherever possible, to boost the credibility of civilian law enforcement. The moment is ripe to formalize such a dynamic approach to security governance, especially in the north, where there is an increase in threats and a tacit recognition of the military as an ally. NGOs and CSOs already in contact with the military and in tune with community concerns offer the path of least resistance for establishing a frictionless framework for dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally important, members of the parliament and their staff need training in civil-military relations and oversight processes for this bilateral engagement to have the lasting impact Ghana needs as it faces real threats inside and outside its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghana has come a long way. In 1957, it became the first sub-Saharan country to achieve independence, and it quickly established itself as a regional leader. However, due to domestic political and security dynamics, coupled with Cold War politics, Ghana experienced military coups from 1966 to 1979 before transitioning to democratic rule in 1992. For the past three decades, Ghanaians have embraced a democratic system and its inherent political alternance. They expect their leaders to deliver on the expectations and promises of good governance, security, and stability. Democratization has also helped professionalize the military and produce one of Africa’s rare republican armies striving to stay above the political fray. However, given the current economic, social, political, and security contexts, it behooves the country’s leadership to correct course and rebuild the people’s faith in democracy and trust in security and defense institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the Ghanaian government and the parliament should consider several initiatives to foster better citizen engagement and institutional responsiveness, and bridge the gap between security providers and civilians, by undertaking the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launch dialogues with key civilian stakeholders, starting with traditional leaders—particularly in the areas where they wield great influence and including youths, women, and others—to get the full measure of the level of discontent and the drivers of mistrust between the population and institutions. CSOs involved in security issues should be allowed to speak without fear of harassment or retribution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adopt, promote, implement, and enforce policies that ensure accountability, transparency, and inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hold more public hearings in parliament and other avenues on matters of law enforcement, security, and defense, with expert contributions from CSOs that work closely with the population.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand human rights training programs for security and defense institutions, including gender-sensitive training, to diffuse tensions between these institutions and the population.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforce and augment the police’s capacity to carry out its mission, including overhauling and reforming procedures and structures, recruitment, training, and remuneration. These changes are necessary to help police perform better and rebuild the people’s trust.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depoliticize the military so it stays above the political fray and remains republican. This entails limiting the use of the military in law enforcement operations, which is critical in preserving discipline, unity, and professionalism. It will also preserve the military’s mystique and civilians’ trust in the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Address the citizenship issue of the Fulbes/Fulanis living in border regions. These disenfranchised and stigmatized communities are vulnerable to abuses by Ghanaian officials and extremist groups, with the latter recruiting from these communities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After facing setbacks in the Sahel, the United States must recognize that the lack of citizen access to the discourse on security represents an underlying driver of instability in coastal West Africa. The absence of state engagement in citizens’ concerns has emboldened alternate—and sometimes violent—local strategies for crime fighting, including tacit and overt alliances with groups linked to violent extremist organizations. Therefore, U.S. strategic security objectives in littoral West Africa should prioritize reducing the factors that have unraveled stability in the Sahel region—namely, the lack of localized security governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and other allies are best positioned to help Ghana address these challenges by supporting programs that accomplish the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Train members of the parliament and their staff to build expertise in oversight of defense and security institutions through exchange programs with legislative bodies of partner countries, including the U.S. State Department’s International Visitor Leadership Program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build the capacity of CSOs working on security issues to acquire the necessary expertise for overseeing, monitoring, and sustaining effective civil-military relations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build the capacity of defense and security institutions and provide the necessary expertise and best practices for communicating with CSOs and the population and sustaining effective civil-military relations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghana is a key partner for regional security. The telltale signs of a breakdown in civil-military relations cannot be missed. Given the worrisome security developments in neighboring countries, Ghana must address these challenges and correct course. Strong civil-military relations and oversight processes are crucial pillars of stability and have the lasting impact Ghana needs as the country faces real threats from within and outside its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and the United States have had a close partnership for over a century, fighting side by side in every major war since World War I. In recent years, as threats have evolved and challenges have multiplied, the U.S.-Australian alliance has become increasingly salient for policymakers in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, China has become increasingly aggressive with its stated intentions and its actions. There is a growing list of examples of China using economic coercion against those that contradict its specific interests. According to CSIS research, at least “eighteen Western and Asian countries, including Japan, Lithuania, Norway, and Australia, and over 123 private companies, including Walmart and the National Basketball Association, have been targeted, precipitating tens of billions of dollars in economic damage.” China is also increasing its gray zone tactics in the broader Indo-Pacific region, including violating the territorial waters and airspace of other nations. Over the last decade, China has routinely violated Japan’s territorial waters, and in August 2024, a Chinese military airplane entered Japanese airspace for the first time. Chinese actions in the South China Sea regularly violate international laws of the sea, such as deliberately ignoring the 2016 United Nations Arbitral Tribunal ruling, which ruled in favor of the Philippines, and attacking Australian divers with dangerous sonar pulses. China has been quite vocal about its goal of unifying Taiwan with the mainland, which would have profound consequences for regional stability and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concern over China’s posturing is laid out in each nation’s strategic planning documents. In the United States, the National Security Strategy characterizes China as the U.S. military’s pacing challenge, with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as “the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.” The document highlights the importance of working with allies and partners to maintain a rules-based international order and notes that, “The war in Ukraine highlights the criticality of a vibrant Defense Industrial Base for the United States and its allies and partners.” Australia’s 2024 National Defense Strategy identified Chinese actions in the Indo-Pacific—and especially in the South China Sea—as directly endangering regional stability and Australia’s national security interests, while also emphasizing Australia’s role as an active shaper of the Indo-Pacific strategic environment. This “National Defence” doctrine recognizes Australia’s contribution beyond its national borders and the increasing importance of military and industrial cooperation with the United States to uphold the international rules-based order through enhancing deterrence, strengthening force posture, and increasing production of munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and the United States are well postured to work in partnership against global threats. The two nations first became treaty allies with the passing of the Australia-New Zealand-U.S. (ANZUS) treaty in 1951 and now have multiple other formal relationships, including the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing agreement along with Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The U.S. and Australian militaries train together, and U.S. Marines rotate annually through Darwin, in Australia’s Northern Territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formal bilateral arrangements include the Agreement concerning the Status of United States Forces in Australia (SOFA) of 1963, the Logistics Support Agreement (LSA) of 1989, the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) of 2010, the Treaty concerning Defense Trade Cooperation of 2013, and the Force Posture Agreement of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is also a key U.S. trade and investment partner. Australia has a Reciprocal Defense Procurement Memorandum of Understanding (RDP-MOU) as well as a Security of Supply Arrangement with the United States. In 2016, the U.S. Congress added Australia to the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB) arrangement. The Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) came into force in 2005. The arrangement that has received the most attention recently is the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) partnership, announced in 2021. AUKUS, which has two pillars, is designed to counter twenty-first-century threats through enhanced technology partnerships. Pillar I is designed to bolster Australia’s military capability with a new fleet of conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarines. Pillar II focuses on developing new technologies in the areas of artificial intelligence and autonomy; quantum technology; hypersonic, undersea, and advanced cyber capabilities; electronic warfare; and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these arrangements support the goal of stronger economic ties while creating opportunities for business enterprises to grow their markets and build economies of scale by selling in partner nations. Rising defense budgets in both the United States and Australia offer new opportunities, even in a highly competitive international arms market. Australian defense companies have been constrained in their growth by the smaller size of the domestic Australian defense market, which has limited their ability to produce competitively at scale. The local prominence of global defense primes’ subsidiaries has filled some of this gap. The United States’ market presents an opportunity to increase sales, build the scale of production by building systems that both nations use (commonality), and invest in innovation and new product development. Simultaneously, larger U.S. prime contractors might look to increase the market for their products in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders in both nations have affirmed their goals of enhanced defense industrial cooperation. In the United States, the National Defense Industrial Strategy highlights the goal of “building enduring industrial advantages through a resilient defense ecosystem . . . to include supporting our allies and partners with key capabilities to strengthen integrated deterrence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s Defence Industry Development Strategy focuses on growing the country’s sovereign industrial base and includes engaging with allies and partners as part of the broader strategy. The sovereign industrial base aims to provide sufficient capacity to ensure that Australia is a key stakeholder in a short list of pivotal domains while also enjoying the benefits of being incorporated into a larger web of production. The strategy aims to avoid the trap of trying to autarkically produce all its defense needs locally. As the strategy details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Co-design, co-development, co-production and co-sustainment of capability will make effective use of combined resources, strengthening collective defence industrial capacity, enhancing interoperability, and accelerating technology development. The goal is to build capable, resilient, competitive, and secure supply chains that include Australian businesses, and create economies of scale for the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries’ visions recognize the importance of a strong industrial base and how working with allies and partners can contribute to this goal. Turning these ideas into action will require time and attention from senior policymakers to translate the strategic vision into tactical-level steps to identify and fund requirements and overcome existing barriers. Necessary actions include facilitating critical technology transfers, allowing for the sharing of classified and sensitive information, and providing opportunities for defense firms to enter each other’s markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been important recent steps to address some of the policy challenges, such as changes to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) regime, which is designed to limit the proliferation of advanced technology to problematic actors. On September 1, 2024, the AUKUS exemptions to ITAR went into effect, granting Australia and the United Kingdom the same privileged status within the U.S. defense industrial base (DIB) as Canada, after the State Department determined that the export control systems of both countries are “comparable” to those of the United States. The reforms add an expedited licensing process for exporting some defense articles to AUKUS partners and increase the scope of exemptions for transferring defense articles to some dual nationals who have security clearances from Australia and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there has been less research on the experiences that private enterprises face when trying to do business in the partner nation. If the U.S. and Australian governments truly want to encourage defense industrial cooperation, they should address the full spectrum of challenges and adjust policies accordingly. The research analyzed in this report aims to support this goal by providing a framework to better understand barriers and catalysts to cooperation. This framework builds off existing research by diving deeper into the defense industrial cooperation component of security cooperation, assessing the challenges faced by industry, and providing recommendations to both government and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-report-outline&quot;&gt;Methodology and Report Outline&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on research, interviews, and workshops, this paper gives an overview of the goals of the U.S.-Australia alliance, with a focus on strengthening the entire defense industrial ecosystem. The project team reviewed policy documents focused on the strategic goals of the partnership—the “demand” signal for enhanced collaboration—as well as documents describing the breadth and depth of defense industrial ties between Australia and the United States. The research also touched on the laws, policies, and cultural barriers that limit these ties, including the export control regimes of both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews included discussions with government personnel on both sides of the Pacific. The team gathered data from engagements with government representatives at the working and senior levels. These engagements included a conference in Canberra, Australia, with a public keynote by Hugh Jeffrey, deputy secretary of strategy, policy, and industry at Australia’s Department of Defence, and a follow-on conference in Washington, D.C., with a public keynote panel featuring Brian Burton, senior advisor for international and industry engagement with the Office of the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy, and Graham Chynoweth, former director of international policy and global investments with Office of Strategic Capital at the U.S. Department of Defense. The panel discussion in Washington began with opening remarks from Paul Myler, former deputy head of mission at the Embassy of Australia in Washington, D.C. Each conference included private track 1.5 dialogues to establish space for forthright discussion, and the twin conferences allowed both Australian and U.S. stakeholders to have the opportunity to take center stage. Some of the industry executives interviewed for the project had previously worked in government, allowing them to offer perspectives from both viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team also conducted interviews with business leaders from Australian and U.S. companies on their experiences doing business in the partner nation. The interviews were structured around three questions: What are the catalysts for defense industrial cooperation? What are the barriers to this cooperation? What are your recommendations for overcoming these barriers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviewees included representatives from 9 large U.S. defense contractors, 8 of which are doing business with Australia. The team also spoke with representatives from 19 Australian companies. Only one of these had decided not to pursue business with the United States because of perceived challenges. The other 18 are either doing business with the United States or are trying to break into the market. These companies were identified through two means. The Austrade representative in the Australian embassy in Washington offered a list of companies that they worked with on marketing to U.S. and global industry. To avoid any bias by using a sample defined by the Australian government, the study team also worked with a Washington-based consultant who advised Australian companies more generally, including those trying to break into the U.S. market. While the challenges offered by the two groups were not notably different, the second group did include an enterprise that viewed the challenges as too daunting to even explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this introductory chapter, Chapter 2 gives an overview of the history and strategic vision of the U.S.-Australia alliance. Chapter 3 describes a framework for defense industrial cooperation. Chapter 4 puts the experience of the interviewees into the context of this framework. Chapter 5 looks at catalysts for cooperation and the larger ecosystem challenges. Chapter 6 summarizes the report, offers recommendations, and concludes the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-history-and-vision&quot;&gt;Strategic History and Vision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-strategic-challenge&quot;&gt;Current Strategic Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States and Australia share a long history of deep cooperation, the contemporary strategic environment is propelling both countries to pursue a significantly expanded and deepening set of initiatives. The rapidly deteriorating strategic environment has been a key driver in strengthening the U.S.-Australia alliance in recent years, with an increasingly assertive China, and its ever-more-aligned partner Russia, standing at the forefront of this challenge. Not only has Beijing undertaken an unprecedented buildup of its military power, it also has increasingly used that power to rewrite the international rules-based order to favor its autocratic view of the world. China’s malign actions in the South China Sea, weaponization of trade, aggressive activities in cyberspace, confrontational posturing toward Taiwan, and tacit support for Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine have reinforced the critical role that allies and partners play in countering these destabilizing actions and working together to reinforce the rules-based international order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, efforts to counter these threats to security have only grown more complex as cyber capabilities have proliferated, potent technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing have emerged, and warfare has quickly evolved to include the widespread use of unmanned systems. These new capabilities have enabled China’s and Russia’s increasingly bold activities, whether by exploiting gray zone tactics to meddle with critical infrastructure like undersea cables, employing unprecedented force to bully smaller nations in their own exclusive economic zones (EEZs), or threatening stability across the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size and scale of these challenges demand collective action. In many respects, deterrence is a numbers game counted in production capability. This is especially true in conflicts that demand large quantities of munitions and platforms. Here, China and Russia have surged ahead, putting their defense industrial bases on a wartime footing. On their own, nations that value a free and open international rules-based system will struggle to match Chinese and Russian production capacity and deter destabilizing activities. This is a fight the United States and its like-minded partners and allies can win—or, better yet, can avoid through deterrence. In this new age of partnerships and alliances, deterrence must become a collective endeavor, and this endeavor demands integration and alignment of defense systems and industries in ways never seen before. There is no place more promising to start than by revamping the U.S.-Australia alliance to ensure that it can both align national strategic visions and also produce the vital defense equipment needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;history-of-the-strategic-partnership&quot;&gt;History of the Strategic Partnership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 U.S.-Australia Joint Leaders’ Statement presented an alliance at historic heights—aligned in global outlook and committed to partnering to address the most pressing threats of the twenty-first century. This statement was not a sudden anomaly of foreign policy; the U.S.-Australia relationship has over a century of cooperation upon which a deep-seated foundation of trust has been built. The two countries celebrated the 80th anniversary of diplomatic ties in 2020, but defense relations go back even further, with the United States and Australia having fought side by side in every conflict since World War I. The alliance has defined the relationship almost as long, with 2021 marking the 70th anniversary of the ANZUS treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more recent times, Australia’s participation in the Gulf War (1990–1991), Iraq War (2003–2011), and War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) has endured and loomed in the minds of politicians and the public alike. During the Gulf War, Australia committed over 1,800 Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel, three frigates, a destroyer, and two supply ships as part of a wider international coalition under directive of the United Nations. In 2003, Australia contributed a significant military force for the initial invasion of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia was one of the first nations to join the coalition force for Afghanistan, consisting of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, with forces numbering 1,550 ADF personnel. Prime Minister John Howard invoked Article IV of the ANZUS Treaty in support of Australia’s involvement—the only time the treaty has been invoked. The Australian parliament supported the commitment on September 17, 2001, and Canberra committed forces to Afghanistan in October 2001 after the 9/11 attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting side by side over decades has forged increasingly strong defense and security ties, as exemplified by the establishment of the annual U.S. Marine Rotational Forces to Darwin (MRF-D), increased U.S. Air Force deployments to Australia, and the U.S.-Australia Force Posture Agreement in 2015. The Joint Statement on Defense Cooperation, signed in October 2015, was put in place to further bolster security collaboration, with an eye to a changing strategic environment. And, of course, the 2021 signing of AUKUS demonstrated an unprecedented leap for the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolution-of-us-australia-alignment&quot;&gt;Evolution of U.S.-Australia Alignment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhanced security ties such as MRF-D evolved out of the United States’ initial “pivot” toward Asia, which began in 2011. This pivot was a result of a growing realization within the U.S. government that Asia—subsequently broadened in linguistic and geographic scope to the Indo-Pacific—would be the center of gravity for economic and geopolitical developments over the next several decades. Concurrent with this realization was the understanding of the threat China posed to not just the international rules-based order, but the United States’ position as a global and regional leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that no single country can alone meet the global challenge posed by China. As stated in the most recent U.S. National Security Strategy, “shared challenges that impact people everywhere demand increased global cooperation and nations stepping up to their responsibilities at a moment when this has become more difficult.” The role of allies and partners has taken center stage in U.S. national security thinking, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the Indo-Pacific, where “a free and open Indo-Pacific can only be achieved if we build collective capacity for a new age; common action is now a strategic necessity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past decade has also seen a dramatic shift in Australia’s perception of China as a growing threat, and with this shift has come a converging alignment of U.S. and Australian outlooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s 2016 Defence White Paper recognized that the country’s “strategic planning is not limited to defending [Australia’s] borders,” and that part of Australia’s strategic defense interest was “in a stable Indo-Pacific region and rules-based global order which supports our interests.” However, the report avoids direct reference to China’s role in challenging this rules-based order, instead noting that Australia’s strategic environment faced “uncertainty” due to the evolving U.S.-China relationship. It states that a key “driver” of (not threat to) the strategic environment is the competition between the United States and China but does not single out China’s actions in and of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2016 white paper was the product of an Australia that in many ways framed itself as a passive recipient of its proximate strategic environment. It aimed to protect the homeland and its immediate interests through maintaining relationships and procuring appropriate defense equipment. The white paper deemed the alliance with the United States of primary importance for Australia, but mainly from the perspective of the United States as the global power through which the rules-based order could best be maintained. In fact, the paper even referenced a continuing defense relationship with China: “The Government will seek to deepen and broaden our important defence relationship with China while recognising that our strategic interests may differ in relation to some regional and global security issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s 2020 Defence Strategic Update represented a marked shift in the framing of the country’s role in the region as one that had both agency and responsibility to proactively shape the regional environment. The update presented three new strategic objectives: to shape Australia’s strategic environment, to deter actions against Australia’s interests, and to respond with credible military force when required. It noted that the “drivers of change” from the 2016 review had “accelerated faster than anticipated,” requiring a relook at defense priorities. The update stated bluntly that the reason it was written was that “the Government has directed Defence to implement a new strategic policy framework that signals Australia’s ability—and willingness—to project military power and deter actions against us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This update pointed to “grey-zone activities” and coercive behavior to alter the rules-based order (although not directly attributed to China) as primary threats to Australia’s security, rather than just two of many challenges. It continued to hold up the U.S.-Australia alliance as central to Australian strategic planning, but here Australia’s role was framed as one of a capable partner that must work alongside the United States to “build defence cooperation in the region to meet security challenges,” and “should be most capable of military cooperation with the United States” in the immediate Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Defence Strategic Review (DSR) further underscored an evolving strategic perspective in Canberra, laying out the argument that Chinese actions in the South China Sea and Australia’s “near neighborhood” directly threatened Australian security and national interests, and further stating that Australia has the responsibility to directly contribute to the collective security of the region and the maintenance of the international rules-based order. The review recommended a shift in focus from a “defence of Australia” doctrine, which it stated was “no longer fit for purpose,” to one of “National Defence.” Accomplishing this, according to the DSR, would require a whole-of-nation and whole-of-government approach that recognizes the integral role Australia must play in the region. This sentiment is echoed in the 2024 National Defence Strategy (NDS), which emphasizes that “Australia [has] a vital role and interest in maintaining a region where state sovereignty is protected, international law is followed, and all nations can make decisions free from coercion.” The NDS reinforces the centrality of the U.S.-Australia alliance to Australia’s national security and specifically calls out AUKUS for its role within the larger architecture of critical security arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-goal-of-a-stronger-us-australia-defense-industrial-cooperative-ecosystem&quot;&gt;The Goal of a Stronger U.S.-Australia Defense Industrial Cooperative Ecosystem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bold initiatives require actualization. Maximizing the potential of the U.S.-Australia alliance requires alignment among relevant policymakers, political leadership, and industry. The 2023 DSR astutely recognized that the “current approach to capability acquisition is not fit for purpose.” The entirety of the review sets out commitments that knit together a system more willing and able than ever before to support greater defense industry integration with the United States and other partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving defense integration presents several difficult challenges, including facilitating critical technology transfers, allowing for sharing of classified and sensitive information, and providing opportunities for defense firms to enter each other’s markets. There have been previous efforts to facilitate greater defense industry collaboration and lower the barriers to such collaboration, but these efforts have largely stalled due to the complexity of the task overshadowing the possibility of success. The drivers of action, however, have now changed. The strategic imperative of the day and direction from the highest levels of the U.S. and Australian governments demand renewed effort toward the goal of a truly cooperative ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there is already a strong history of alignment upon which to build. Australia’s close strategic relationship with the United States has translated into support in the U.S. Congress and from the president for closer industrial relationships. This was shown in 2017 with the expansion of the U.S. National Technological and Industrial Base (NTIB) to include Australia and the United Kingdom. That unilateral legislative act extended many of the benefits enjoyed in the close U.S.-Canada partnership to two more of the United States’ closest allies (but crucially a partial ITAR exemption like that enjoyed by Canada would only come years later). In theory, NTIB membership means that, for many purposes, U.S. purchases from Australia and the United Kingdom count as domestic. In practice, however, this status often falls short. For example, U.S. acquisition officials and those in industry will often apply “No Foreign” restrictions or other limitations that undercut the meaning of this designation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three countries hold a bilateral Reciprocal Defense Procurement Agreement (RDP-A) with the United States, which means that “Buy American” provisions do not apply to U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) purchases from those nations. Along with New Zealand, these countries also enjoy a close intelligence-sharing relationship with the United States through the Five Eyes arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrangement that has received the most attention recently is the AUKUS partnership, announced in 2021. AUKUS, including its two pillars, is designed to counter twenty-first-century threats through enhanced technology partnerships. Pillar I is designed to enhance Australia’s military capability with a new fleet of conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarines. The Pillar II technology partnership focuses on new technologies, including artificial intelligence and autonomy; quantum technologies; hypersonic, undersea, and advanced cyber capabilities; electronic warfare; and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout its modern history, Australia has primarily been an arms importer, albeit one whose largest projects tend to have an aspect of local production. The United States has been its largest supplier, as seen in Figure 2.1, with the United Kingdom being the second-largest supplier since the 1950s, though that flow has weakened in the post–Cold War period. Australia’s largest purchases from the United States have been in the aviation sector, including fighter aircraft—the F-35A and F-18A—as well as the E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft and the P-8A maritime patrol aircraft. Australia has exported to the United States, most prominently the expeditionary fast transport (EPF), which had a major role for Australian domestic production. The United Kingdom and France have provided aircraft to Australia as well, predominantly the Hawk-100 trainer and the A-330 MRTT tanker and transport, respectively. Spain’s and Germany’s biggest transfers have been ships, Hobart destroyers and MEKO-200ANZ frigates, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bilateral cooperation between Australia and the United States has been strong and enduring. It has also been influenced by the relative size of the two nations’ economies and defense budgets. The United States has built up a world-leading industrial base, supported both by national acquisition programs and strong exports to allies and partners. U.S. firms have set up subsidiaries in many allied nations, selling advanced technologies to those governments. Thus, the present push toward greater Australian cooperation with the United States builds on an Australian defense industrial base that is already highly internationalized, with local representation from the United States and other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ge6U1WI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been ownership turnover of several Australian firms in recent decades. Government-owned prime Australian Defense Industries (ADI) was first sold to a mix of international owners in 1999. In 2006, ADI, the largest Australian defense firm, was granted permission to become a fully owned subsidiary of Thales. In that same year, the third-, fourth-, and fifth-largest Australian firms were BAE Systems Australia, Raytheon Australia, and Boeing Australia, respectively, all of which are international subsidiaries. The second-largest Australian prime in 2006, Tenix Defence, similarly became a subsidiary of BAE Systems in January 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade data is a useful supplement to the major weapon systems tracked by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) because trade data can capture the back-and-forth flow of components as well as completed systems. The bilateral trade data for Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, as seen in Figure 2.2, reveals that the underlying U.S.-Australia trade relationship remains rather one sided and lacks the full extent of industrial integration that exists with the other large U.S. NTIB partners. Geography is one factor here, as the United States and Canada share a major land border and have been integrating their defense industrial bases for decades, including the United States’ first partial exemption to arms control regulations. The Australia-to-U.S. export relationship has been growing, and for the reasons discussed above, trade flows in both directions are likely to further deepen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4KNNwyV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the size of the U.S. defense enterprise, prime contracts by the DOD provide another illuminating angle on U.S.-Australia cooperation, with U.S. relationships with Canada and the United Kingdom adding further context. Figures 2.3, 5.4, and 5.5 have an NTIB-4 or Australia-specific aspect, indicating an international (non-U.S.) origin, international vendor headquarters or nationality, or place of performance outside of the United States. In a striking contrast to Figure 2.2, the magnitude of acquisition is roughly comparable in this time period to that between Canada and Australia. When looking at the structure of prime contractors, Australia resembles the United Kingdom, with the bulk of its market share being taken by U.S. subsidiaries of international firms; in Australia’s case, this is largely due to work by the U.S. subsidiary of Australian shipbuilder Austal on the aforementioned EPF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-way-forward&quot;&gt;The Way Forward&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with formal treaties and the variety of strategic frameworks supporting a strong relationship between Australia and the United States, both nations have recently published strategies focusing on strengthening their defense industrial bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, the U.S. Office of Industrial Base Policy within the DOD’s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment put forth a National Defense Industrial Strategy (NDIS) designed to “catalyze generational change from the existing defense industrial base to a more robust, resilient, and dynamic modernized defense industrial ecosystem.” The strategy has four strategic priorities: resilient supply chains, workforce readiness, flexible acquisition, and economic deterrence. Economic deterrence specifically recognizes the role of working with allies and partners to strengthen capabilities and deter adversaries. The strategy’s June 2024 implementation report highlighted that Australia has been designated as a domestic source for U.S. Defense Production Act funds in the FY 2024 National Defense Authorization Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD also published a new Regional Sustainment Framework in 2024 that recognizes the important role of partner nations in conducting maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) on U.S. systems, especially if there is a conflict. Australia’s location in the Pacific will help reduce the transportation of systems from the Pacific area of responsibility (AOR) that need repair, especially useful given concerns about increasingly contested logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Australia released a Defence Industry Development Strategy (DIDS) that also highlights international industrial partnerships, described as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Close industrial collaboration with trusted international partners [that] will help build the strategic weight Australia needs to shape the future, making the nation less vulnerable to coercion and helping to deter conflict by increasing the cost of aggression against Australia and its interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Co-design, co-development, co-production and co-sustainment of capability will make effective use of combined resources, strengthening collective defence industrial capacity, enhancing interoperability, and accelerating technology development. The goal is to build capable, resilient, competitive, and secure supply chains that include Australian businesses, and create economies of scale for the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alignment in strategies offers a promising foundation for further defense industrial cooperation as part of a larger framework. The next chapter offers a more detailed discussion of defense industrial cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense-cooperation-and-defense-industrial-cooperation&quot;&gt;Defense Cooperation and Defense Industrial Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;understanding-defense-cooperation&quot;&gt;Understanding Defense Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of public statements and formal policies affirm the strength and endurance of the defense relationship between Australia and the United States. This relationship fits into a broader frame of U.S. defense cooperation, which the DOD defines as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a generic term for the range of activity undertaken by DoD with its allies and other friendly nations to promote international security. Such activity includes, but need not be confined to, security assistance, industrial cooperation, armaments cooperation, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), training, logistics cooperation, cooperative research and development (R&amp;amp;D), Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT), and Host-Nation Support (HNS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One highlighted approach is industrial cooperation, which can take a variety of forms. McGinn’s 2023 study highlights five pathways for a “Build Allied” approach to defense industrial cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;an increase in the number of U.S. subsidiaries of foreign defense companies,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;co-development of systems or subsystems across two or more countries,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;co-production of defense systems across two or more countries,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;second-sourcing or licensed production to qualify multiple producers for the same part or system, and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;foreign sustainment (maintenance, repair, or overhaul) of existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While policy statements highlight the role of government, the specific pathways above require the participation of industry at the tactical level to execute the strategic vision. (Specific catalysts and barriers to industrial participation are the subject of this research and are covered in more detail later in the report.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literature highlights numerous benefits that drive governments and industry to pursue defense industrial cooperation. Big picture benefits include strengthened ties between nations and national militaries through the enhanced interoperability and interchangeability that common systems may yield. From an economic perspective, defense industrial cooperation brings a range of advantages that mirror benefits of non-defense trade. Supply chains that cross national lines mean that complex modern systems can access a wider range of ideas, technologies, parts, and raw materials. Technological alliances between private firms, which provide access to information from partners, bolster these firms’ performance in innovating within high-tech industries such as aerospace and defense. Systems can be produced with greater economies of scale, moving down learning curves to lower unit prices and reducing fixed costs such as research and development (R&amp;amp;D), facilities, and advanced machinery as a proportion of production costs. Scholars have long noted that firms, and indeed nations, can specialize and take advantage of comparative advantage. Even if the United States were the leading allied producer across all categories of systems, allied capacity would be increased at the margins by firms and countries focusing on their relative strengths rather than seeking to do it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specific economics of the defense sector also make international defense cooperation attractive to governments interested in lowering costs, fostering innovation, and building production capacity. The barriers to entry into the secretive and complicated sector of weapon system production are high, making competition—which can lower unit costs to the government and foster innovation—difficult to foster. This is particularly true if a nation’s addressable defense market is small. Integration across national lines brings the possibility of new competition, often provided by domestic subsidiaries of international firms or through joint international ventures. Integration may also help solve challenges in the industrial base (e.g., labor shortages) if nations are able to engage those capacities in other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the benefits of industrial cooperation, which are based on well-established and demonstrated economic principles, there are a variety of concerns. The cooperative production or transfer of weapons brings with it humanitarian, destabilization, and other foreign policy concerns. Nations cooperating on defense manufacturing can be reluctant to embrace production specialization, as it can cause the loss of a full range of domestic military supply. That loss of supply brings sovereignty concerns and may make it harder to address the needs of individual militaries because partner nations may have imperfectly shared national military objectives. Insufficient controls on the spread of technical information by partner government or industry actors can diminish a nation’s advantage in military technologies. Finally, even when fighting wars together, nations may be tempted to put their own military requirements at the front of the line ahead of equipment ordered by allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the politics of justifying military or civil acquisition spending often intersects with job benefits in the producing countries. Cooperation may raise concerns about exporting jobs, which will affect the calculus of elected leaders. Research shows that it is possible for the economic benefits of cooperation to overcome political opposition and even generate new vested business interests and defense communities of trust to accelerate further cooperation. However, that requires a long-term political and strategic view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major challenge to defense industrial cooperation is managing the inherent complexity of working across multiple industrial and acquisition systems. Research has highlighted management complexity as a compounding program risk factor on top of technical complexity—the difficulty of producing systems due to their technological needs—given that the scale and expense of major weapons systems frequently exceeds the capacity of individual firms and nation-states. One response to both management and technical complexity is adopting a minimalist approach to international cooperation which avoids cooperation on large or critical systems, favors co-production or modification over co-development of systems, and prioritizes maintenance and sustainment cooperation above R&amp;amp;D and procurement cooperation. These challenges—humanitarian concerns, proliferation, trust, politics, and management and technical complexity—are all long recognized and addressed by a mix of laws, regulations, and policy approaches, but these approaches in turn can become barriers to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;categorizing-catalysts-for-and-barriers-to-defense-industrial-cooperation&quot;&gt;Categorizing Catalysts for and Barriers to Defense Industrial Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense industrial cooperation across national borders requires catalysts—reasons for action—as well as deliberate efforts to overcome barriers. The challenges described above tend to be more abstract than the experiences of government and industry personnel who are working to make cooperation happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach to specify barriers is offered by Jennifer D. P. Moroney et al. in a 2023 report on U.S. security cooperation, which provides a typology of barriers that impede U.S. security cooperation with highly capable allies and partners in the air, space, and cyber domains. The authors examine defense industrial cooperation as part of the broader framework and note that it is subject to numerous barriers. The author’s research and framework focus on security cooperation, which is led by government actors. Adding information derived from CSIS interviews with industry conducted as part of this research, this report expands the framework to include a broader range of issues which government policies may help resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 3.1 includes an overview of barriers and is an extension of the framework offered in the work of Moroney et al. The figure includes the addition of the economic barriers experienced by industry, as derived from the literature and informed by this project’s interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS expanded Moroney’s framework by including an “economic” barrier category with three representative examples. The first is an insufficient business case to incentivize industry to conduct international cooperation activities. The second identifies the costs—both financial and the opportunity cost of personnel time—associated with learning a new acquisition system in the partner country or the cost of acquiring or establishing a subsidiary company and offices in the partner nation. The third is the potential misalignment of corporate strategies between defense firms which prioritize different end markets and products, thereby hampering their ability to effectively cooperate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pathways-for-us-australia-defense-industrial-connections&quot;&gt;Pathways for U.S.-Australia Defense Industrial Connections&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial cooperation requires the support of governments to set the vision, define the policies, and provide the funding. Most defense industrial cooperation requires the participation of industry, which employs the wide range of skills required to develop and produce systems, run the factories, and manage the supply chains. Industrial organizations may appreciate that defense cooperation supports the foundation of a peaceful and stable society, but they are also profit-seeking organizations looking for customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying recommendations to overcome barriers to industrial cooperation must start with an overview of how that cooperation happens. Interviews with Australian and U.S. government officials and industry leaders revealed a complex system of integration across the two nations’ defense ecosystems. These included industry in one nation selling systems to the other government, a company supplying components to government or industry, or firms developing programs and technologies together in various forms of partnership. This web of corporate relationships is further complicated by the fact that industries may establish subsidiaries within the partner nation and that companies may sell to the partner government via both their main business units and their partner-nation subsidiaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry-to-government relationships can include Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) from U.S.-based primes to the Australian government. Sales from Australian firms to the DOD employ a variety of pathways, from direct contracts, routing contracts through their U.S.-based subsidiaries, selling subsystems or components to U.S. primes, or even selling to the Australian subsidiaries of U.S. primes for later resale. Government-to-government relations add another layer, revolving around Foreign Military Sales (FMS) agreements and co-development and co-production efforts. Table 3.2 summarizes these from a market (buyer/seller) construct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/z1L4v4f.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3.2: Types of Industrial Connection.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian firms reported four primary pathways to sell to the DOD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contracts via a U.S. subsidiary that they have established&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Direct contracts from their Australian entity&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Selling systems or components to a U.S. prime that then resells or passes them through to the DOD&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Selling systems or components to the Australian subsidiaries of global defense primes, which then sell products with Australian content to the DOD&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding complexity to these four main pathways are two further interlinkages between them: U.S. subsidiaries of Australian firms could sell products to U.S. primes that then were resold to the U.S. government, or Australian products sold to U.S. primes could be transferred to that prime’s Australian entity for integration into a system before being sold to the DOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, there are several pathways of connection whereby U.S. firms interface with the Australian Department of Defence (ADOD):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. arms sold to Australia, with the U.S. government facilitating via the FMS process&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. prime contractors selling systems to Australia via DCS&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australian subsidiaries of U.S. defense primes selling products to the ADOD&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;some developed independently in Australia with Australian suppliers&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;some all or partially based on content from the United States&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australian firms selling systems to the ADOD that include U.S. content in the supply chain or place of performance content from their U.S. subsidiaries&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-development and co-production efforts are additional, government-enabled frameworks for cooperation which can occur between firms with varying degrees of government intermediation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the two lists are not the same, which can be explained in large part by the fact that the DOD has a significantly larger budget than the ADOD, which has led to a larger and more capable U.S. defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ykXcdgG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3.1: Pathways to Connection.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the pathways is a critical step toward enhanced and increased cooperation. The next step is identifying and assessing the existing barriers. CSIS interviews with Australian firms and DOD officials indicated that direct sales to partner governments are difficult due to complexities in information sharing and U.S. acquisition processes. Interviewees revealed that easier pathways to defense industry cooperation were via their own U.S. subsidiaries, U.S. defense primes, or the Australian subsidiaries of U.S. defense primes, even if these routes were less direct. In Figure 3.1, the pathways of cooperation are portrayed to clarify the various interactions in the cross-Pacific defense industry ecosystem. Chapter 4 will discuss barriers encountered on each pathway, and Chapter 5 includes a version of Figure 3.1: Pathways to Connection with the lines colored by reported difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-industry-perspective&quot;&gt;The Industry Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barriers to Cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy benefits of defense industrial cooperation between Australia and the United States are well understood and have led to the many cooperation agreements, mentioned in previous chapters. Despite those agreements, however, the interviews conducted for this project revealed numerous tactical-level barriers to cooperation, with roots both in the government and within industry itself. This chapter summarizes this project’s research on those challenges, with a deliberate focus on the industry experience of business enterprises that work in Australia and the United States. This chapter is organized using the framework discussed in Chapter 3 and captures data from the interviews in each of the framework categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the data analysis, it became clear that the categories are not independent. Regulatory barriers on export controls create cultural barriers of risk avoidance. The budgetary challenges of limited government funding diminish the business case for investing in cooperation. Many of these challenges could be placed in more than one category and, therefore, will be highlighted where they are particularly pertinent. This supports the finding that the challenge of cooperation is a broader ecosystem issue, one that requires simultaneous changes across multiple levels instead of narrow policies focused on one challenge. This chapter will lay out the tactical challenges presented by individual barriers to cooperation, and Chapter 5 will discuss an ecosystem approach to these barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;budgetary-getting-the-money-from-budgets-to-contracts&quot;&gt;Budgetary: Getting the Money, from Budgets to Contracts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business organizations must continually consider their financial picture, and interviewees frequently mentioned budget concerns when working with both the United States and Australia. These concerns related both to budgets on the national level (making this a political issue as well) along with the timely and long-term funding of projects (overlapping with bureaucratic acquisition concerns).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Australia, businesses’ budgetary concerns centered on how government funding levels impacted the extent of what the government of Australia was able to invest in. For example, one U.S. company speculated that a large project was terminated because the Australian government wanted to put those resources toward AUKUS Pillar I nuclear-powered submarines instead. Another issue raised was a lack of consistent funding across governments, without which industry is less able to access the resources necessary to invest in production to scale and sustain production over time. One interviewee summarized this as “lots of promises are being made and not a lot of money is flowing.” This impacts both Australian and U.S. companies working to do business in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the U.S. government does not face the same overall funding issues. Funding stability is mostly ensured once new requirements become programs of record, with the caveat that frequent continual resolutions limit new program starts. However, the delays caused by the budget process are seen as a barrier by both Australian and U.S. industry when doing business with the U.S. government, indicating that some of the challenges identified by industry when considering international cooperation projects are in fact generic challenges endemic to working in the defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be difficult for companies to get longer-term, multiyear funding. More complex projects benefit from firm commitments for funding across multiple years. Companies may be eager to work together across national lines, but as the U.S. subsidiary of an Australian firm noted, “both governments struggle to give long-term contracts” which would enable this cooperation. Ramping up a supply chain and the workforce requires a multiyear commitment to be economically worthwhile, but those longer-term commitments are difficult to extract and run into political barriers within both nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are solutions to all these issues, but they are challenging to enact. The Australia budget challenge could be addressed by the government consistently funding defense over time, but this is a policy that will depend on national government decisions. Another approach for the Australian government is to deliberately help Australian industry strengthen its export market to ensure a more consistent customer base over time. In fact, this is the approach being taken in the Guided Weapons Explosive Ammunition (GWEO) enterprise, which is focused on munitions production. An export-focused approach could build upon Australia’s 2018 Defence Export Strategy, which advocated for Australia to become a top 10 defense exporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge links budgeting and contracting processes. For small businesses, delays in finalizing a contract, which can relate to the government’s availability of funds, can mean that they do not have the resources to pay their employees and, moreover, will otherwise interfere with the longer-term viability of the enterprise itself. Small enterprises frequently noted that “the government does not understand cash flow.” Payment delays are disruptive to any business, but small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may be particularly vulnerable. Furthermore, Australian firms often complain that banks and venture capital groups in Australia lack sufficient capital supply because of reliance on foreign sources, exacerbating critical balance-of-payment issues for Australian SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one DOD interviewee suggested that the United States has more funding streams available than Australia does to bring projects from early-stage science and technology into more advanced stages of development, using vehicles such as the Defense Innovation Unit or the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The individual recommended creating a dedicated pot of funds in Australia for investing in these early-stage efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other discussions raised the specifics of getting paid. One Australian company highlighted that a U.S. defense innovation organization’s default payment method was via check, and that it cost more to get them to wire funds. Another complained that the aforementioned organization did not know what a SWIFT key was, delaying payment by eight months. This was reported to create months-long delays before the DOD could find the correct form to process the payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of industry being able to access stable funding with enough certainty to grow production to scale and scope is by no means unique to the international cooperation context, and it represents a challenge for business enterprises doing business for their own national governments as well as for those of partner nations. While strengthening relations with partner nations via defense industrial ties is not the main goal of any nation’s budget process, the negative impacts on partners of budget perturbations are real and should be a consideration in deciding if industrial cooperation with allies is a true priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bureaucratic-navigating-complex-acquisition-systems&quot;&gt;Bureaucratic: Navigating Complex Acquisition Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. defense acquisition system can be difficult to navigate, even for U.S. firms. This difficulty is magnified for small Australian firms and amplified by the lack of personal connections with decisionmakers, societal and cultural differences, and the tyranny of distance and tight travel budgets. Australian firms report finding it hard to understand who U.S. decisionmakers are and how to connect with them, a challenge also shared by small U.S. businesses. Interviews with Australian industry often noted that “if Australian companies don’t understand the U.S. procurement system, they can’t sell.” Many of these Australian firms added that hiring U.S. advisers as guides to understanding the system is expensive, which serves as a deterrent for trying to make the jump into the U.S. defense ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. government organizations need a contract vehicle as a pathway to get funds to performers. Many Australian SMEs reported that U.S. contracting vehicles are difficult for them to use, requiring them to go through larger U.S. companies as resellers, which reduces the SMEs’ profit margins and, therefore, their incentive to cooperate across the Pacific. The issue of the reseller dynamic arose several times as a complicating factor in Australian firms closing deals. An Australian firm going through a U.S.-based reseller is going to have longer lead times for contracts and may miss out on business opportunities due to speed (or lack thereof ) rather than capability—an issue complicated and magnified by the already long lead times for export control licenses and security clearance processes. Another complicating factor is the U.S. acquisition workforce’s unfamiliarity with acquisition processes for foreign firms, which leads some DOD acquisition staff to encourage Australian firms to work with resellers. This well-meaning advice may be given without fully considering the impact it could have on the speed of the Australian firm’s subsequent contract and therefore the firm’s business case for working with the DOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia does have a dedicated agency called Austrade whose mission includes helping Australian exporting companies grow their business. Austrade has representatives stationed in the United States, and according to this project’s interviewees, the agency has provided useful guidance in navigating U.S. processes and providing information about tenders. One company noted that “We would not have been able to do what we did without Austrade.” Another offered, “Austrade has been incredibly helpful—[they help companies] plug into shows and be part of delegations and make it easier to go to [conferences] like SeaAirSpace.” On the other hand, other companies noted that Austrade has provided briefings on a less detailed (and therefore less useful) level and has not helped them navigate the U.S. market, largely due to Austrade lacking the necessary contacts with customers. Smaller businesses interested in exporting did not always know how to access Austrade’s tools. Policymakers should consider providing additional support for the agency so that it could more effectively reach out to new defense companies interested in exporting. A throughline in Australian interviews was the necessity of education both for industry and the government in terms of the opportunities for partnership and the specific bureaucratic challenges that need to be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cultural-two-nations-divided-by-a-common-language-and-an-ocean&quot;&gt;Cultural: Two Nations Divided by a Common Language and an Ocean&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural barriers were among the most common types of impediments mentioned by the interviewees and spanned across most of the pathways of connection in the defense industrial relationship. One challenge centers on the differences between corporate culture in Australia and the United States regarding considerations like self-promotion and seeking legal advice from counsel. According to both Australian and U.S. interviewees, Australian firms tend to be much less self-promoting when discussing their products with U.S. officials or businesspeople than Americans are used to, leading to occasional moments of mismatched expectations and underappreciated offerings from Australia. One interviewee noted that “Australians are not pushy. . . . They don’t puff themselves up.” Furthermore, Australian firms are much less likely than their U.S. counterparts to seek legal recourse or the advice of counsel when encountering regulatory difficulties in U.S. acquisition efforts or business-to-business (B2B) engagements, such as with export controls restrictions. This can hamper the ability of Australian firms to get contracts compared to U.S. entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Cultural differences get overlooked between the U.S. and Australia. . . . We like to believe that they are very similar, but the cultures are very dissimilar. The similarities outweigh the dissimilarities, but they are very different cultures.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-us-firm&quot;&gt;— U.S. firm&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another cultural barrier identified by interviewees relates to bureaucratic and regulatory issues. Both nations prefer local suppliers, which affects the relationship on both sides of the Pacific and limits cooperation. Even as the countries align closer on defense cooperation, and senior officials make statements and policies about the essential nature of AUKUS and U.S.-Australia cooperation, interviewees noted persistent parochial favoritism from mid-level officials in acquisition and business decisionmaking processes. This was pervasive in the United States, including with the DOD acquisition workforce and when partnering with U.S. companies. One Australian company noted, “Americans like things made in America, a culture which flows through to procurement people from corporate leadership.” Government and industry preference for local suppliers is a known factor across global procurement, with the literature highlighting an even greater local preference by government than industry actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk aversion is a persistent cultural challenge across the defense cooperation space, one often linked to other barriers, including regulatory ones. Australian interviewees noted that U.S. government officials are hesitant to green-light cooperation with Australia, even if they have the authority to do so. Working-level officials are perceived as adhering to the status quo, even as senior leaders advance new visions of cooperation. This is mirrored in industry, where companies are sometimes overly cautious despite encouragement from government officials with regulatory authority. This occurs even when considering sharing information already publicly available on corporate websites. One Australian company offered an example where a U.S. government agency approved the use of their products, but then lawyers at the prime contractor directed an additional review out of an excess of caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee highlighted risk aversion as a serious problem when thinking about the competitive global landscape, which links cultural factors to political ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If China is our pacing threat, [we should] find things we can go jointly after. Not in the 50 people in a room, hierarchical setup, 18 months to deliver first article, another 18 for testing. Time is our enemy; we’re squandering opportunity. Only so long we can say PRC won’t catch up with us; they have smart people too. Creativity and adaptability only go so far. $50 million and fail on the prototype, that’s acceptable. Accept some amount of failure. There’s chatter on working an innovative way, but hard if afraid of failure/losing job. [Requires] more of a culture shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increased recognition of the strategic challenge may help the U.S. government embrace a global supply chain. Policies like the National Defense Industrial Strategy highlight the importance of allies and partners as part of an economic deterrence strategy. Consistent messaging across administrations in both nations (which demands strong leadership support) is required to evolve government and industry cultures over time—though this alone may not be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-moving-from-policy-announcements-to-tactical-support&quot;&gt;Political: Moving from Policy Announcements to Tactical Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry in both nations observed that even with the necessary political support, translating policymaker intent into action has proven difficult. One interviewee observed that all politicians “love announceables” but that moving from the policy level into tactical execution was more of a problem. In spite of pronouncements, there was some cynicism as to whether national governments were truly behind cooperation. In general, businesses did not always see the next steps necessary to move the vision into action even though they thought the governments believed what they were saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One U.S. prime interviewee argued that the most likely business successes came from U.S. companies selling systems to Australia but getting beyond that was difficult, observing that the goals of highly publicized agreements like “AUKUS . . . [don’t] trickle down to the small companies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The ambiguity around how these high-level strategic agreements translate into business opportunities is harmful to the Australian business community because they are making assumptions on how to export and if they lose money they may exit the business.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-australian-firm&quot;&gt;— Australian firm&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several Australian interviewees expressed frustration with inconsistent signals from the United States, where government policies seemed to support cooperation but failed to result in business opportunities for Australian companies. One employee stated that “If the U.S. is just saying no to Australian products, that’s fine. . . . The problem is unclear messaging. [When] he talks to other defense companies . . . they all don’t have clarity.” The offered solution was that the ADOD “needs to be more direct about the need for the United States to understand and support Australia business,” which would depend on the DOD listening to and valuing this message from the ADOD over its other priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are government efforts in support of industrial cooperation, such as Australia’s investment in the Global Supply Chain (GSC) Program and Austrade (covered above). The GSC Program is an export initiative aiming to give Australian companies better opportunities to enter the supply chains of global defense primes by providing funding to “establish a team within their company dedicated to identifying export opportunities leading to contract award for Australian suppliers in both Civil and Defence businesses of the Prime.” Not every interviewee at the U.S. primes mentioned the GSC Program, but at least one found it to be a very useful support for bringing Australian firms into their supply chain. That said, in the interviews, many Australian SMEs expressed distrust of the commitment of the major U.S. primes—or their Australian subsidiaries—to incorporating Australian companies into their supply chains. The SMEs were concerned that U.S. primes use Australian SMEs as “window dressing” for their Australian government bids to comply with local preference regulations, only to squeeze the Australian SMEs out of these contracts later. One colorful Australian interviewee, describing the defense system in Australia, said that the “organ grinder is the [U.S.] primes, and the monkey varies between the government and the Australian industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One U.S.-based Australian interviewee was a former employee at a U.S. prime contractor and had also spent time working in the U.S. government. They suggested that that while the United States says it wants cooperation, what it really wants is “U.S. companies to split off units and do business for Australia. We are much less interested in building up native Australia companies—don’t want them to be too competitive.” Nevertheless, other U.S. defense prime figures repeatedly stressed their commitment to the GSC Program and noted the successes they had seen under it. U.S. industry individuals did note that the GSC Program was more effective when the Australian government had previously provided funding for Australian SMEs to qualify as subcontractors under the program, an initiative that could be revitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulatory-policy-underpins-many-cooperation-challenges&quot;&gt;Regulatory: Policy Underpins Many Cooperation Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government regulatory policy, including national export control regimes, shapes and limits defense industrial cooperation. Export controls have multiple goals, including limiting the export of sensitive military technologies that could find their way into the hands of adversaries. The challenge that export controls create is extensively highlighted in the literature on cooperation, but changes are being instituted to support AUKUS. In the U.S. system, there are at least 37 departments, agencies, and commissions with export control authority, including the Departments of State, Commerce, and the Treasury. The State Department handles International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) compliance and the U.S. Munitions List for traditional military capabilities, and the Commerce Department enforces the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the Commerce Control List for dual-use technology. The Defence Export Controls (DEC), part of ADOD, oversees military and dual-use export controls through the Defence Trade Controls Act 2012, Defence Trade Controls Regulations 2013, and the Defence and Strategic Goods List. In March 2024, Australia changed legislation to place controls on the re-export of articles originally from Australia, information sharing on controlled technology areas to certain foreign persons in Australia, and various defense services, which went into effect on September 1, 2024. Following changes approved to Australian export controls, the U.S. State Department amended ITAR to provide licensing exemptions for Australia in technology areas not included on the Excluded Technology List, which also went into effect on September 1, 2024. The U.S. Commerce Department implemented EAR changes as well, proposed and in effect by April 2024, enabling Australia to be treated in the same manner as Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. State Department’s goal for export controls is to “mitigate diversion and proliferation risks, which both bolsters U.S. national security and contributes to regional and international security and stability.” Interviewees universally understood and supported the goals for ITAR and other methods of information and export control regulation, but they highlighted that these regulations also create delays and other challenges for industrial cooperation. One U.S. prime specifically noted that the pace of the regulatory review did not match the pace of the acquisition cycle. Australian export controls are simpler, but export controls from each country are not the only regulatory barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Australian companies, fear of U.S. export control penalties can affect their business dealings with the United States. One U.S. company stated that “if they violate ITAR . . . [Australian firms] are worried about getting put out of business by a foreign regulator.” Smaller vendors fear that they will be put out of business if they receive a penalty for violating ITAR. On the other hand, one larger Australian firm noted that the concern is often misplaced: “People think ‘I am at the risk of going to jail,’ but if they follow the process then that’s just not going to happen.” The small scale of many Australian firms amplifies the stifling effects of information security regulations, as their compliance teams and their financial margins for error are much smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protracted wait times can also be barriers to business. A U.S. prime interviewee indicated that if they wanted to work with an Australian SME, they could face production delays of up to 90 days while waiting for a license. They noted that “oftentimes those opportunities come and go within 90 days.” There can also be holdups if a firm changes suppliers, and delays can be detrimental to smaller companies. One U.S. firm argued that “Regulation shouldn’t be easier [to navigate] for those with resources.” Australian regulators have their own resource limitations and likely will need additional resources and funding following the enactment of new export controls to successfully implement these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information sharing is another barrier for foreign suppliers interacting with U.S. primes, as foreign suppliers can face hurdles that in-country business dealings will never encounter. From the very start, conversations between a U.S. company and a foreign partner on sensitive topics can require ITAR approval—and the line between the two can be unclear, causing delays while this is determined. If the Department of State issues approvals only for a portion of the conversations needed, that is insufficient for building international cooperation. While some State Department personnel interviewed noted their progress in approving thousands of these approvals, a U.S. industry figure argued that the department needs “to approve millions to cover all the potential conversations—or else to change policy.” The September 1, 2024, ITAR reforms between the United States and Australia may be able to abate this problem once companies become part of the “authorized user list,” although there is still a range of excluded technologies which remain a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. export and information control apparatus has led participants in the U.S. defense sector to proceed with caution when dealing with foreign actors, even if allies. For the United States, “they’re built to never engage with a foreigner.” While export control reforms have taken place in both Australia and the United States, there will likely be questions over who can operate license-free. Moreover, if businesses expect to need licenses and face delays, they could avoid certain suppliers or partners. Stakeholders need to allow time for industry to understand these changes and feel safe operating under the greater flexibility of a new export control policy. The regulatory barrier posed by export controls is therefore intertwined with the cultural barriers of risk aversion and resistance to change within the U.S. acquisition workforce and compliance departments in U.S. defense primes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“ITAR/export controls focus on a thing or a defense article. Even if all of these are removed [after reforms], we need to accept that it will take time for folks to understand what it means and to execute it. The real barrier, when that’s gone, there will be a hesitation/blockage of the systems. It will be ok if it takes 3 to 6 months. But if it takes years…”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-us-firm-1&quot;&gt;— U.S. firm&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another regulatory barrier relates to limitations on sharing information, including classification and controlled unclassified information (CUI). Classification of information is meant to prevent damage to national security by controlling information release. The challenge this presents is not always visible to Australian companies, but their employees with military experience sometimes remarked that it is much easier to share information between the partner militaries than it is to access classified information on the industry side. This creates challenges for partnering on some national security projects and also sometimes limits Australian access to marketing opportunities in cases where tenders are classified. Even though it notionally presents less of a danger to national security, CUI was described as sometimes more difficult to handle than classified information because, while there are carefully established channels for classified information, the way to properly handle CUI is not as clear-cut. Interviewees also raised concerns about NOFORN markings prohibiting access to non-U.S. persons, which creates similar difficulties for access and also lacks a clear-cut and expeditious process for removal. One industry representative suggested that to enhance cooperation “YESFORN is the objective, NOFORN is the barrier.” Interviewees suspected that NOFORN labels are sometimes simply the default habit of an overly cautious acquisition and industrial workforce, rather than reflective of the contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-the-need-for-a-common-view-of-the-challenge&quot;&gt;Strategic: The Need for a Common View of the Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Australian governments are closely aligned on their strategic outlooks, with both seeing China as the main strategic concern. However, one area where the United States and Australia have been reported not to see eye-to-eye on strategic issues is the ability of Australia to acquire certain U.S. systems. Interviewees noted that Australia often wants to purchase advanced U.S. technology that is still in the early R&amp;amp;D phase using the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) approach. The U.S. government, however, does not like to sell equipment that is still in early-stage R&amp;amp;D because, as one U.S. government official noted, “we don’t sell systems that won’t meet the requirements. . . . This is the problem with FMS, which is transactional, not meant to be flexible and have vision and work with different strategies and designs.” U.S. caution on FMS sales processes has occasionally clashed with Australian eagerness to acquire cutting-edge U.S. tech, a downstream problem from slight misalignments on strategy and timing of acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technical-aligning-engineering-details&quot;&gt;Technical: Aligning Engineering Details&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ongoing challenge to cooperation is the existence of different technical standards and varying technical standards regimes. These differences may be physical incompatibilities, or there may be regulations that impose specific policies depending on the source. Differing standards can impede the ability of companies to work together and limit their ability to sell to partner governments or participate in partner supply chains. This issue was raised in several of the interviews as one of the tactical challenges that the interviewees did not see being addressed in policy statements: “People want to get technology as fast as possible, [but] a company will have to produce a completely different variant for different [customers].” This challenge demonstrates that strategic vision in support of partnership cannot drive industrial cooperation without the identification and solving of specific challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the examples raised during the interviews is the fact that the two nations have different regimes for the non-destructive testing of defense articles. Australia has the National Australian Testing Authority (NATA), but this authority is not recognized by the United States. Meanwhile, the United States has the National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program (Nadcap), an industry-led cooperative accreditation program for aerospace and defense industries. These two programs have different training of test operators and different standards for test success. Companies can put their articles through the other nation’s test regimes, but this duplication of testing adds time and additional costs. One interviewee argued that standards could be assessed to see if they are close to those of the other nation; if they were, companies could then be permitted to test in only one nation while being certified in both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Standards is a small thing but could be impactful moving forward. Under AUKUS, there are working groups at technology levels, [but they have] not extended into standards . . . those are the big barriers.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-australian-firm-1&quot;&gt;— Australian firm&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any deviation in standards also means that when technical details or parts need to be changed, even slightly, the part may need to be recertified. This increases the costs of non-recurring engineering, which can then increase the average cost of a part. One company raised the issue of different voltage standards as a source of recertification requirements (standard voltage in the United States is 120 V, Australia’s is 240 V): “We meet a higher standard, but we don’t meet the U.S. standard. Because the standard is slightly different, we have to recertify.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee noted that there is an AUKUS working group to address technical standards, but this challenge is complex and cross-cutting from the defense industrial base to the broader national manufacturing industrial base. To fully tackle this long-term challenge, the interviewee recommended that the working group should have the authority to create an action plan to address different standards, with the goal of continually identifying and addressing differences that create challenges for cooperation and cross-border sales. Other frameworks and organizations have found ways to establish common standards. One interviewee pointed out that NATO has a common standard, demonstrating that a solution across national borders is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one interviewee raised a complication to overcoming this barrier: there may be benefits for incumbents in maintaining different standards, as it limits competition: “The primes developed this and don’t allow outsiders in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-making-it-worthwhile-to-invest&quot;&gt;Economic: Making It Worthwhile to Invest&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic challenges for industry are intertwined with their access to capital, the scale of their firm, and their corporate aspirations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies mentioned the challenge of finding funding, which plays out differently in the two economies. It is perceived to be easier to raise funds in the United States because of the size and strength of the venture capital community. In Australia, there is “skepticism in their own market,” and the “investment community [is] skeptical about the U.S. market.” Better funding from government could bridge this funding gap. One company argued that we “need to unlock funding . . . quickly to win opportunity—look at process, what Australia does well and what [the] U.S. does well, look at convergence of how we do funding and financing for small business.” In the United States, the DOD’s Office of Strategic Capital has been set up to try to “crowd in” private capital for defense and dual-use technologies, a model that could be adopted in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We haven’t seen a lot of actionable things come to market about workforce problems, and how we will share knowledge and skills across the two continents. . . . The broader population is completely unaware of what all the jobs and job opportunities will be. Joe plumber doesn’t know about this. There is available talent that is disconnected from the demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-australian-firm-2&quot;&gt;— Australian firm&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue highlighted was the challenge of scale, especially when partnering with, selling to, or competing with U.S. firms. Australian companies are often much smaller than their U.S. partners, and a deal that is a matter of survival for an Australian company may be relatively unimportant for their U.S. partner. One Australian firm noted that they “have to partner with U.S. companies and then [work] at the whim of their creative ambitions. [U.S.] companies were making huge gains in passing through the work.” For a small company, the costs of the procurement process can be overwhelming: “How do I compete with a 10-person team at IBM focused on this Request for Proposal (RFP) when I’m three people and a cat.” Industry as a whole faces strong government pressure to manage costs, but the customer can be oblivious to the economic repercussions of delays and other bureaucracy. One U.S. firm noted that “government regulators on both sides don’t seem to be concerned about the economic impacts. They are focused on national security. . . . The Hill underestimates the scale of these transaction costs. Industry doesn’t make the case effectively about the impact of delays.” Small companies feel these burdens acutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Australian SMEs noted that small firms occasionally hold unrealistic expectations about what their role in U.S.-Australian business-to-business cooperation could look like given their size and production capacity. As a recent Australian Strategic Policy Institute report on AUKUS Pillar II cooperation notes, “size matters” in defense cooperation. Medium or large enterprises have greater scale than small ones, which allows them to more easily upscale their production when needed and to navigate complex bureaucratic tasks like export controls or acquisition. An Australian firm noted that being a “perennial smaller company working with larger companies,” their firm faces the “challenge of being treated as a peer or equal. Larger or established companies, [find it hard] to take the reputational risk of partnering with a start up.” Multiple Australian SMEs noted that they had more success working with small U.S. firms than with the primes. One ADOD official similarly commented that companies needed to find firms of similar sizes with which to match up. U.S. firms stated that they believe Australian companies are less willing than U.S. ones to partner up in order to conquer new, non-U.S. markets and are naive about what technology is required to compete globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another barrier is a lack of industry alignment between Australia and the United States regarding the form and focus of possible future industrial collaboration. Indeed, some of the aforementioned Australian SMEs’ lack of trust in U.S. primes and their frustration with the GSC Program may stem from misaligned expectations of what Australian firms and U.S. firms can productively partner on. The GSC Program identified second sourcing and exploiting innovative technology as potential inroads for Australian firms into prime supply chains, with success seeming to have been found more in the latter than the former. Interviewed companies reported that it is very difficult to bring in Australian firms as new second-source suppliers due to non-recurring engineering costs, the difficulties of technology transfer, and a high learning curve leading to a production cost well above target price. In short, Australian firms struggle to compete against entrenched, typically U.S., firms. In DOD contracting, even when second sources of products or systems are identified, there is no guarantee they will be cost competitive, and those which are competitive are often U.S. firms that do not face the same challenges as Australian SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In connection with the cultural barrier of parochialism, more than one Australian company highlighted the necessity of being both aggressive and sensitive to local issues to successfully enter the U.S. market. Simple steps such as registering a website with a “.com” address instead of a “.com.au” address may overcome initial U.S. suspicion about working with foreign suppliers and lead to companies getting past an initial screen. Australian businesspeople will need to travel to the United States and do their own marketing. Another Australian firm stated that “they [Austrade] won’t do business for you—you have to knock on doors, build [your] own pipeline [and sell] into [your] own market. . . . I look for what events are happening and go to as many as possible to meet in person.” Oftentimes, success relies on the personal determination of entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-final-challenge-and-concluding-thoughts&quot;&gt;A Final Challenge and Concluding Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last barrier, mentioned in almost every interview, is the “tyranny of distance.” Australia and the United States are half a world away from each other. Vastly different time zones mean that connecting on the phone during business hours is a challenge, and the flights take almost a day in both directions and cross the International Date Line. There is no easy solution for this. The fact that industry continues to press to cooperate despite this challenge is a signal of a broad commitment to cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One company offered this bottom line: “It’s hard to break into the U.S. market as an innovative Australian firm (just as it is for an innovative U.S. firm). Partnering with U.S. companies can help. However, it takes time to meet people and understand the market space. The Australian government can invest in this kind of education, bringing people to the U.S., helping them identify partners. It won’t happen all at once.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can encourage these efforts and lessen barriers where possible. Continual problem-solving can occur if the right spaces are available to bring together industry and government to tackle challenges. One interviewee suggested “forums for capturing and progressing innovative ideas” in support of AUKUS with sufficient “industry submissions.” This could be a path forward for quickly fixing barriers as they arise, especially with recent export control changes in each country and a new regulatory operating environment for companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ecosystem-dynamics&quot;&gt;Ecosystem Dynamics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding and resolving the challenges that industry faces when working in partner economies is a necessary step toward enhancing cooperation. As the experiences reported in the last chapter indicate, barriers to cooperation are pervasive and complex. Furthermore, many of the individual challenges have broader implications. Regulatory issues contribute to cultural challenges. Government budget churn can harm companies, and instability can drive companies out of business. This chapter will examine the implications of these specific challenges to the broader ecosystem of defense industrial cooperation, looking for lessons on cooperation, including positive catalysts and cross-cutting barriers. Fixing individual challenges is a critical part of the solution, but experience shows that getting the right stakeholders aligned with the proper incentives across the entire ecosystem is also necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation can start with government-to-government initiatives such as those included in the AUKUS initiatives, referred to here as the “G2G” pathway. Governments can purchase goods from a partner nation’s defense industries, a business-to-government or “B2G” approach. Efforts to foster industrial cooperation should also focus on international business-to-business cooperation between defense companies, or “B2B.” The G2G and B2G relationships are foundational for defense industrial cooperation, but the B2B relationship can lead to a market-driven form of cooperation. Lasting bottom-up cooperation occurs when companies integrate across national lines into each other’s individual ecosystems: becoming part of each other’s supply chains, co-developing products, and competing against each other to sell to the same corporate and government customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After surveying cross-cutting barriers in the ecosystem, this chapter will examine the three types of relationships shaping the ecosystem. It starts by surveying the G2G policy space and incentives. This chapter will then examine some aspects of the U.S. acquisition system relating to international defense procurement, which can be a B2G challenge for Australian firms working to grow their defense businesses in the United States. Lastly, the chapter will examine B2B dynamics between the United States and Australia and identify current and future catalysts to cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;identifying-systemic-challenges-and-opportunities&quot;&gt;Identifying Systemic Challenges and Opportunities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The barriers highlighted in Chapter 4 represent specific challenges industry experienced when doing business with the partner nation. Industry shared several pathways to cooperation, including directly selling to the partner government through one of the avenues for defense acquisition, getting incorporated into a partner industry’s supply chain, or setting up a local subsidiary. The barriers to cooperation differed across each pathway and are denoted in Table 5.1 with an X if reported for that pathway in the interviews conducted for the study. (For example, the second row denotes which kinds of barriers were reported during interviews with Australian firms which have direct contracts with the U.S. government.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GSgJ1FE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5.1: Barrier Crosswalk Across Pathways of Connection.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mapping these barriers as they relate to the pathways for cooperation reveals two insights. The first is that some of the barriers are cross-pathway, meaning that they are pervasive across multiple paths. For example, cultural challenges are present across most pathways of defense industrial cooperation. The second insight is that some pathways encounter multifaceted barriers, where many barriers in one pathway reinforce each other, increasing the difficulty of using that pathway. Notably, Australian firms working to sell directly to the U.S. government face multiple interlinked barriers. On the other hand, U.S.-based subsidiaries of Australian companies working with U.S. prime contractors face far fewer of these same barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 5.1 reveals the complexity of these often-interrelated barriers. More specifically, cross-pathway barriers include cultural barriers such as risk aversion within industry and parochialism within government, which is a reported factor across all actors and pathways (except those within a single nation). Regulatory barriers, especially export controls and compliance requirements for the DOD, pervade many pathways. Two types of bureaucratic barriers are endemic across different pathway types: (1) Australian entities interacting with U.S. ones indicated that overuse of NOFORN markings limited the information they could see; and (2) both U.S. and Australian entities selling to the U.S. government reported that the U.S. acquisition workforce suffers from personnel shortages and lack of training on working with foreign businesses. Economic barriers, especially funding uncertainty, appeared across many pathways and were often linked to budgetary barriers in government and to regulatory barriers in industry, both slowing funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multifaceted barriers afflict certain pathways more than others, leading these pathways to be even more difficult. This dynamic is visualized in Figure 5.1. This chart takes the connections presented in Figure 3.1—the original pathway wire chart—and colors them by the reported difficulty of overcoming the barriers endemic to each pathway noted in Table 5.1. The “reported difficulty” assessment is informed by interviews with both industry and government figures. Note that Figure 5.1 does not offer a measure of the desirability of different paths, as a difficult path may offer a good risk-reward balance as long as the challenges can be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OuoePYs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.1: Pathways of Connection by Difficulty.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian firms selling directly to U.S. primes face a variety of multifaceted obstacles, including bureaucratic, cultural, regulatory, strategic, technical, and economic barriers. A hypothetical example of an Australian firm trying to sell product to a U.S. prime can be used to illustrate how barriers can reinforce each other within a given pathway. In this example, a U.S. prime considering buying an Australian firm’s product might find that it is unable to freely discuss product requirements and capabilities due to how its culturally cautious legal department interprets complex U.S. export control regulations. This hurdle is worsened by the Australian firm’s cultural reluctance to seek legal counsel to push back on this interpretation of ITAR rules, either with the U.S. prime or either government. Even if the U.S. firm applies for the export control license requested by its compliance department to show its own systems or discuss its requirements with the Australian firm, bureaucratic delays in the processing of these licenses could delay the process by months—and the same delay would happen if the Australian firm ever wanted to export its product to the United States. The potential sale is then further afflicted by the U.S. prime’s reported cultural disinclination to buy from non-U.S. suppliers, which is only heightened by the technical challenge of non-reciprocal testing and certification regimes requiring the product to be recertified under U.S. systems—yet another expense and time cost. Furthermore, if the U.S. prime is seeking to replace an existing inferior supplier with a superior Australian offering, the cost and challenge of reworking supply chains would be an additional economic barrier. These kinds of multifaceted challenges present wicked problems which can be overcome—but only with sufficient catalysts for cooperation. And the solutions must go beyond simplistic diagnosis and simple recommendations to make a difference. Addressing the export control regime alone is insufficient to catalyze cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis of cooperation is not entirely bad news. In addition to showing current barriers, Figure 5.1 also highlights easier pathways in the ecosystem. For example, the interviews showed that bilateral cooperation is taking place in lower-resistance pathways such as the creation of U.S.-incorporated subsidiaries of Australian firms, which are displayed in green. The next part of this chapter discusses current catalysts to cooperation within G2G, B2G, and B2B interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-to-government-dynamics&quot;&gt;Government-to-Government Dynamics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and the United States have long been strategic partners. The main catalyst for a new emphasis on cooperation between Australia and the United States is the shared view of the changing threat picture, as described in Chapter 2. Policymakers in the United States and Australia have made concerted efforts to align their countries’ security efforts. Agreements such as AUKUS and GWEO are major political efforts and are representative of an increased strategic emphasis on the importance of direct industrial cooperation. During public events conducted for this project, Australian government figures have offered strong statements in support of cooperation. Hugh Jeffrey, Australia’s deputy secretary of strategy, policy, and industry, has said that “we can no longer afford to really have our cooperation exist only at the rhetorical domain. It’s got to actually exist at the operational domain.” Paul Myler, then deputy head of mission for the Embassy of Australia in Washington, D.C., stated that “never has it been more important for Australia and the U.S. to work together to ensure our collective deterrence efforts are sufficient to prevent escalation into regional conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G2G arrangements within the acquisition realm include supporting co-development, co-production, co-sustainment, and exports via foreign military sales which employ the U.S. acquisition system to deliver a product or service to the recipient government. G2G arrangements fall into the broader category of security cooperation, a topic which has been the subject of extensive research and is the source of the Moroney et al. framework which this research expanded to include business issues. With the exceptions of the organic industrial base and the transfer of systems already in inventory, G2G activities to support security cooperation in the acquisition realm almost inherently imply additional B2G relationships both within and across national borders. To better understand defense industrial integration, this report draws out the B2G and B2B pathways that may be embedded within or overlooked by analyses that focus only on government actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G2G agreements are critical enablers of defense industries working together, and government actors seek a range of benefits from cooperation, such as innovation, cost savings, economies of scale, enhanced operational interoperability and interchangeability, and support for industry and jobs in their own country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as many interviewees noted, while policymakers on both sides of the Pacific have offered strong public support for cooperation, both governments have struggled to convert policy pronouncements into concrete actions and funding. Government actors collectively face conflicting incentives due to the difficulties inherent in issuing new policy, along with a lack of direct rewards for the hard effort of making cooperation happen. According to William Greenwalt and Tom Corben, these conflicting impulses contributed to the lack of success of at least one previous major effort at defense industry integration between the two nations, the United States-Australia Defence Trade Cooperation Treaty. The researchers report that many in industry found this treaty ineffective due to its slow implementation and a lack of support among dedicated pockets of the U.S. export control workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry also faces conflicting impulses when considering international integration and benefits from G2G efforts as a signal to act. In the defense production realm, integrating new foreign suppliers or forming international joint ventures will often bring into play obstacles that do not exist when working with domestic partners. These more difficult forms of corporate activity are more likely to be undertaken when industry is responding to a clear government demand signal, especially when otherwise easier options exist domestically. Nonetheless, government actors typically do not experience the same urgency or incentives to act as industry figures, who are driven to international buyers by the pursuit of profits. While government action can create a strong demand signal for actors in industry to cooperate across the Pacific, the independent push from industry to expand their business is a vital driver of defense industrial integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;business-to-government-dynamics&quot;&gt;Business-to-Government Dynamics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desire for profit and for the capital needed to invest in and expand business operations is a significant catalyst driving industry interest in working with partner governments. The vastly larger defense budget of the DOD compared to the ADOD means that the U.S. market represents a significant opportunity for Australian firms. U.S. and international defense primes already sell to the Australian government, often through local subsidiaries. They have personnel dedicated to understanding international markets and working with local governments. Discussions with government officials for this project confirmed that the Australian defense industry has fewer prime contractors and a greater emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises. The relative purchasing power and budget of the DOD compared to the ADOD means that U.S. government purchases from Australian industry offer a stronger opportunity for cooperation than the inverse. The DOD’s role as one of the institutions with oversight of defense cooperation efforts also gives it a leading role in promoting and facilitating cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the purchasing power of the DOD and the productive and innovative capacity of the Australian defense industry, there is much latent potential to be catalyzed upon via a closer cross-Pacific relationship. Several specific incentives emerged from CSIS’s research and interviews that have the potential to build an even deeper DOD relationship with Australian producers. These included growing government demand—both in the United States and in Australia—for military products and services, as well as efforts within the United States to change acquisition workforce culture to build willingness and capacity for contracting with foreign firms. (An overarching consideration for the DOD is an increased emphasis on supply chain resilience and economic deterrence. While a driver for cooperation, this may not be as evident to Australian industry.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRATEGIC AND BUDGETARY CATALYST TO COOPERATION: GROWING GOVERNMENT DEMAND&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first catalyst to cooperation is the growing and unmet government demand for military-industrial capacity, particularly from the U.S. government. A confluence of factors—wars in Ukraine and the Middle East coupled with growing concern over China’s increasing military investments and economic warfare—has increased the U.S. demand for military goods, and revealed challenges surrounding the strength of the U.S. defense industrial base and its ability to surge production. The United States has begun considering a variety of solutions, many of which involve working closely with allies and partners to bolster production. Specific to Australia, the Joint Statement on the Australia–United States Ministerial Consultation (AUSMIN) 2024 reaffirmed the importance of Australia’s Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordinance initiative, as it “provides a pathway for the co-development, co-production, and co-sustainment of critical long-range fires and their component supply chains for both nations.” Policymaker energy and attention in the United States is focused on working with allies and partners to expand defense production capacity. As shown earlier in Figure 2.3, there is an existing foundation of Australian work for the DOD that shows that this is possible and offers a springboard upon which Australian firms can build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4NzweEy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.2: DOD Prime Contract Obligations by Origin of Good or Service and Region of Performance.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: FPDS; and CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian companies are clear-eyed about the market benefits of selling to the DOD. As the left graph in Figure 5.2 shows, operational priorities such as the War in Afghanistan can dramatically shape contract trends. As seen in the right graph in Figure 5.2, even with the drawdown and eventual end of the conflict, defense contract spending has increased dramatically from the low point in FY 2015. In recent years, this has translated into a greater willingness by the DOD to buy international products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As depicted in Figure 5.3 below, there is a strong foundation of existing Australian work with the DOD for Australian firms to build upon. Furthermore, as one Australian interviewee offered, the United States has an “appetite for adoption [of new technology] that is more conducive” to scaling innovation than the Australian market. Another Australian manufacturing firm noted that the U.S. market is the largest on the planet and that any company interested in growing needs to take advantage of these opportunities. U.S. technology companies also noted the “hyperscale” platform of the DOD, which “becomes the enabler for everyone to use it to design, develop, test, and deploy software.” A powerful catalyst to cooperation is therefore simply the size of the DOD market, as the scale of DOD platforms is very attractive to innovative Australian firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a growing U.S. government demand for military goods, Australia is also experiencing an increasing desire for sustainable sovereign production capacity. As mentioned in Chapter 2, Australia’s Defense Industry Development Strategy (DIDS) identified seven Sovereign Defence Industrial Priorities (SDIPs), that is, areas of particular focus for its sovereign industry capabilities. This prioritization scheme is not only useful for concentrating the focus of domestic industry but also serves to further close industrial collaboration with trusted international partners, another stated aim of the DIDS. Australia’s emphasis on becoming a key stakeholder in selected pivotal domains as part of an alliance web of production is part of the intragovernmental push for cooperation. Australia’s sovereign capacity concept—which places Australia within a web of allied production—has not only led to G2G initiatives like AUKUS and GWEO but is also based upon Australia’s history of acquisitions from the Australian subsidiaries of U.S. defense primes, another key form of international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A striking finding from the interviews is that one catalyst for international cooperation is Australian firms’ desire to raise their standing with the Australian government. Winning a contract in the United States or the United Kingdom establishes the bona fides of an Australian firm that may otherwise be overlooked, should they attempt to sell directly to their own government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CULTURAL CATALYST TO COOPERATION: CHANGE WITHIN THE DOD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. strategic documents have increasingly highlighted the importance of industrial cooperation with allies and partners, demonstrating the senior leadership support essential for innovative change. The 2024 National Defense Industrial Strategy (NDIS) places significant emphasis on two vectors of international security cooperation and defense industrial base integration: first, arms exports using the U.S. acquisition system, namely the foreign military sales process, and second, building a network of cooperation with allies and partners as part of an overarching concept of “production diplomacy.” Greater integration would come through NDIS section 2.1.2.6, which seeks to boost production and resilience by “incorporating allies and partners into a more networked or web-like production chain,” reinforced by both foreign production through licensing and domestic production via foreign subsidiaries. NDIS section 2.3.2.1 also notes the importance of “standards, modularity, and interoperability” for international collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NDIS’s emphasis on incorporating allies into the U.S. production chain provides a strong signal to the U.S. acquisition workforce that working with allied firms is not just permitted, but desired. Along with strong leadership guidance, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology Doug Bush has stressed the importance of education via training and support of personnel as well as rewarding reasonable, thoughtful risk-taking as foundational to creating cultural change. The availability of business process improvements like the Adaptive Acquisition Framework can also help drive this shift toward incorporating allied firms into DOD acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;business-to-business-dynamics&quot;&gt;Business-to-Business Dynamics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desires to increase sales, build market share, and gain capital for investment and expansion are major drivers for industry-to-industry cooperation. A key element of international defense cooperation between the United States and Australia is building connections between the defense industries of the two nations. Industry-to-industry cooperation has the potential to integrate supply chains, build manufacturing capacity resilience, and deepen cross-border security relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An active and fluid business environment between the two nations’ defense industries is critical to ensuring the success of U.S.-Australian defense initiatives, including AUKUS. The U.S. defense industrial base is heavily integrated with global supply chains, especially those involving its allies and partners, and reducing barriers to cooperation for U.S. and Australian industry will spur further cooperative initiatives—especially those that require less government attention and direction than full co-development initiatives like the F-35 program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense industrial cooperation occurs because of a spur to action—be it a strong business case on the industry side or strategic guidance as a precursor to orders from the government. Given the flurry of policymaking in recent years, both currently exist. Both governments’ strategic visions encourage industry to create strategic partnerships in anticipation of funding in both the present and future. Given the expansion of U.S.-Australian security ties, industry-to-industry relationships have been increasing and, if AUKUS and GWEO succeed, will continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the U.S. and Australian governments take action to amplify these catalysts with decisive policies, there is the potential for a rapid growth in both the breadth and depth of this bilateral relationship. The two primary catalysts to cooperation identified in CSIS’s interviews and research are the growing U.S. demand for military industrial capacity across the globe and the greater use of U.S. subsidiaries of Australian firms as a pathway to supplying U.S. defense primes or the DOD itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ECONOMIC AND BUDGETARY CATALYSTS TO COOPERATION: THE GROWING BUSINESS CASE DUE TO U.S. INDUSTRY DEMAND&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allied support for Ukraine in its self-defense against Russia’s invasion has led to the realization that U.S. defense industry surge capacity is limited. The greater need for capacity is a catalyst for cooperation as the United States looks to enhance its industrial base. The U.S. government’s demand for military industrial goods has translated into a greater need for capacity from overstretched U.S. defense firms—as well as from the second-, third-, and lower-tier suppliers in their supply chains. Second-source suppliers for materials and technology can help fill this gap if enabling contracts are in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is well positioned to take advantage of this growing U.S. defense industry need. Australia can provide technological and engineering excellence in areas of interest to the defense industry. The recent AUSMIN 2024 joint statement stressed “the important role that Australian critical minerals will play in supporting defense and wider economic supply chains,” highlighting Australia’s role as a reliable and strategically aligned source of these key inputs. One major Australian defense manufacturing company noted that they are “seeing more engagement now with the U.S. defense primes, specifically in the last twelve months, than ever before,” implying a “far greater willingness to work with Australia.” The firm attributed this to a combination of the DOD supply chain report highlighting the need for more resilient sources of supply and the AUKUS and GWEO initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY CATALYSTS TO COOPERATION: AUSTRALIAN FIRMS ARE MAKING GREATER USE OF U.S. SUBSIDIARIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian firms have been establishing subsidiary companies in the United States to facilitate partnerships with and sales to the DOD and defense primes in attempts to overcome barriers to cooperation. Responding in part to greater demand from U.S. primes and the U.S. government itself, Australian firms have created relationships with subsidiary firms to facilitate trade. As Figure 5.4 illustrates, most of the funding from DOD contracts with Australian firms for the past two decades has gone to the U.S. subsidiaries of Australian firms, not to Australian entities directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZUm3EMX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.4: DOD Prime Contracts with Australian Vendors and Their U.S. Subsidiaries, FY 2012–FY 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: FPDS; and CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By examining DOD contracts with its first-tier suppliers with an Australian aspect (either Australian headquartered or owned by an Australian firm) by fiscal year, two stories emerge. Interviewees’ reporting high difficulty of selling directly to the DOD are supported by U.S. contracting data shown in Figure 5.4, although the data shows small but consistent gains since FY 2016 of Australian firms selling directly to the DOD. This success is massively outweighed by the much larger volume of sales by U.S. subsidiaries of Australian firms to the DOD. This distinction has supply chain implications, as despite the predominance of U.S. subsidiaries of Australian firms, direct sales by Australian firms are the larger provider of goods and services originating outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, both contracting data and interview findings make clear that having some form of U.S. corporate identity helps overcome some of the barriers for Australian firms selling to the DOD or working with U.S. primes. The first key advantage is having staff on the ground to connect with the personnel from the DOD and U.S. primes. Subsidiaries also make the legal and technical structuring of partnerships with U.S. entities easier—many Australian firms reported that their commercialization strategies involved bringing in more established U.S. companies to act as resellers or intermediaries. A U.S. entity with local staff also avoids many of the regulatory issues with ITAR and security clearances that prevent company staff from going on-site to classified areas in a timely manner. On top of local access and regulatory ease, one Australian manufacturer described buying a U.S. subsidiary as lowering the “activation energy” needed to do business in the United States, as U.S. companies often prefer dealing with a U.S. entity. U.S. defense primes also appreciate working with the U.S. subsidiaries of Australian defense firms, as it allows them to more easily communicate their requirements, hear about the Australian company’s capacities, and then decide about working with either the U.S. or Australian entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian firms that have had success working in the United States can help illustrate the benefits of establishing a U.S. subsidiary to navigate the challenges of doing business in the United States. One Australian engineering and manufacturing firm has contracts both with U.S. defense primes and with their Australian subsidiaries. This firm established a U.S. subsidiary to sell its products more easily to U.S. primes and to mitigate exchange rate issues with the U.S. dollar. The firm uses its U.S. subsidiary to manage capacity requirements—some of its products are manufactured in the United States and then transferred to its Australian entity to be sold to the end customer. Furthermore, some U.S. primes prefer to buy from the firm’s subsidiary to avoid any potential ITAR issues when buying from an Australian location. The Australian firm noted that some of the Australian products it transferred to its U.S. subsidiary were then sold to U.S. defense primes and then ultimately resold to the Australian government via FMS and DCS—a long way home for these Australian defense goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concluding-thoughts&quot;&gt;Concluding Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barriers to cooperation appear as specific challenges but in fact have larger systemic causes and effects. Overcoming barriers means both recognizing and addressing challenges (e.g., the delays caused by ITAR and other export controls) and seeing how they are connected to other challenges (e.g., a broader cultural reluctance on the part of U.S. industry to do business with foreign suppliers). This research has affirmed that there are no simple solutions and that a consistent, deliberate, big-picture approach to continually scanning for barriers and working on solutions will be necessary to enhance defense industrial cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic significance of enhancing defense industrial cooperation between Australia and the United States requires a response grounded in a clear understanding of the specific challenges of this bilateral relationship combined with a broader mastery of the acquisition process and the numerous obstacles to any form of defense industrial cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation can happen, and there are examples of the United States and Australia working together on defense production. The question is not whether this occurs but rather how to make such cooperation easier and more frequent by reducing the individual and systemic barriers identified here. Specific recommendations that can address these barriers are presented below and grouped by the type of barrier that they are intended to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the recommendations focus on very specific problems, and others are broader. As discussed in Chapter 5, these barriers are often mutually reinforcing. For these reasons, some topics, such as standards, appear under multiple categories of barriers, and many recommendations have implications that go beyond the barrier that they primarily address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-budgetary-and-technical-barriers&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Budgetary and Technical Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States and Australia, increasing the speed and quantity of defense production is crucial to addressing the threats that have been identified by their respective national strategies. Achieving these goals will be expensive, even with the opportunity provided by rising defense budgets. Australia recognizes that its desired sovereign defense industrial capabilities cannot be sustained without integration into other defense ecosystems and funding streams. The U.S. National Defense Industrial Strategy correctly identifies greater commonality with partners as an imperative. In short, commonality is an area where industrial integration can and should have a return on investment that offsets fiscal barriers to cooperation. The recommendations below take aim at the technical obstacles to commonality, which in turn will aid in justifying the budgetary investments in cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States and Australia should endeavor to align their requirements for new weapons systems or produce shared requirements, where possible, especially in the context of AUKUS.&lt;/strong&gt; This would allow Australian and U.S. companies to more easily innovate, manufacture, and sell systems to both governments. A crucial related benefit is making operational forces more interoperable or even interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groupings such as AUKUS or the overlapping members of Five Eyes and the NTIB should be used as venues for implementing shared standards working groups.&lt;/strong&gt; Common use of open standards, such as those pursued under the U.S. Modular Open System Approaches, would help standardize components and subsystems to support recommendation 1. To be successful, standards setters should allow partner nations to provide input into the process, to ensure that standards do not unwittingly create unnecessary barriers. The Future Airborne Capability is one example of this form of collaboration that could be emulated elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-regulatory-and-bureaucratic-barriers&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Regulatory and Bureaucratic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory and bureaucratic barriers inevitably add friction to international cooperation. To alleviate some of these obstacles, the U.S. Congress legislated a partial ITAR exemption for AUKUS countries, only the second such exemption in existence. This AUKUS ITAR exemption is a generational shift in U.S. export and technology control policies, moving from mandating licensing to requiring tracking for a range of technology in the territories of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This change has the potential to be transformative not just for AUKUS projects but also for the bilateral U.S.-Australia relationship. Some analysts, such as William Greenwalt and Tom Corben, call for further liberalization in the next steps of implementation. The interviews for this project took place before the implementation language was released; therefore, the recommendations below do not seek to evaluate the implementation of the AUKUS ITAR exemption itself but instead focus on findings from the interviews and data that remain relevant in this rapidly changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures to address regulatory and bureaucratic barriers can be mutually reinforcing, as they decrease regulatory burden and streamline administrative workload. As part of the AUKUS implementing regulation, licensing will be expedited for transfers between Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States in those cases when it is not exempted. Some of the recommendations below follow a similar logic by seeking regulatory or broad bureaucratic changes that would remove the need for approvals for recurring sources of friction that can be addressed on a systematic rather than a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and Australia should enact equivalency agreements that recognize that certain defense standards are close enough to be mutually acceptable, even if these standards are not made in common. Currently, pursuing approvals for defense standards that are similar but not entirely in common is a grinding process that wastes staff time and incurs additional delay. To help alleviate this barrier, AUKUS governments could authorize existing technical working groups to extend their mandates to harmonizing standards and achieving equivalency agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and Australia should mutually recognize each other’s accreditation standards regimes where the requirements are close enough to be functionally interchangeable. The National Australian Testing Authority (NATA) is not currently recognized in the United States, which instead employs the National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program (Nadcap). U.S.-Australia cooperation would benefit from wider adoption in Australia of U.S. National Institute for Science and Technology (NIST) standards for document handling. Doing so would facilitate easier crossing of national lines for defense firms by reducing the need for duplicative and time-consuming reaccreditation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A joint procurement vehicle, such as a pan-AUKUS panel, could be created to deepen AUKUS collaboration, especially in the key areas of AUKUS Pillar II. This panel—similar to what the General Services Administration and Australian government offer—would provide a common framework on which innovative companies could sell to all three countries. A combined Australian, UK, and U.S. call for innovation on electronic warfare within AUKUS resulted in prizes being awarded by innovation units within each country to high-performing national vendors. This “adjacent pools” approach could serve as a useful stepping stone toward a true “common pool” style of joint procurement in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and Australia should fully embrace mutual recognition of security clearances, within necessary parameters. Doing so would assist the efficient sharing of information that undergirds high-technology security cooperation. This recognition could fall under the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing arrangement or be a separate trilateral agreement among AUKUS countries. This step would build on the fact that classified information already appears on the AUKUS ITAR excluded technology list, which, alongside the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing arrangement, indicates significant existing trust on classified information sharing. The September 1, 2024, ITAR reforms include a provision for exemptions for dual nationals or third-country nationals, which allows for security clearances approved by the host-nation government for its employees to count toward the fulfillment of exemption requirements. AUKUS nations should continue to build on this approach to enable as wide an implementation as reasonably practicable of cross-recognition of clearances and should pay attention to the proper enabling changes needed to make such reforms widely used.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Congress should explore passing legislation which would connect the AUKUS and Canadian ITAR exemptions to allow cross-compatibility. The larger NTIB would be invigorated by allowing free movement between the four countries of any technology that met the conditions of both the Canada and AUKUS exemptions. Though the excluded technology lists for AUKUS and Canada are different, they do share large areas of overlap. If the four nations were to agree to this step, it would facilitate NTIB expedited licensing by eliminating the need to consider technology that has already been approved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-cultural-political-and-strategic-barriers&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Cultural, Political, and Strategic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislative and regulatory changes alone are often not sufficient to effectively overcome barriers to cooperation. Cultural change is often necessary to fully institutionalize new authorities or integrate regulations into everyday practice. In the absence of cultural change, new authorities and strategic objectives may be hindered by inertia. Cultural change can be further hampered by competing messages, such as when the United States’ Buy American Office was launched just before AUKUS materialized. Measures such as these create an acquisition culture of defaulting to what is known, streamlined, and easy. Overcoming this cultural default requires not just direction from senior leaders but also consistent reinforcement at all levels and periodic evaluation of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD and ADOD should conduct an audit of the implementation and outcomes of industrial cooperation efforts in preparation for each annual Australia–United States Ministerial Consultation (AUSMIN). Tracking NDIS and DIDS implementation and measuring outcomes allows leaders to identify where strategic goals and rule changes have not yet translated into changed behavior. By looking at the types and levels of cooperation, and building on the larger independent efforts to track NDIS and DIDS goals, relevant departmental leadership can observe and reward cultural change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD and ADOD should furnish an annual report on the implementation of cross-national industrial integration initiatives to their respective legislatures. This report could be derived from the AUSMIN audit in recommendation 3.1. The national legislatures of both the United States and Australia have taken crucial steps to reform their respective export control processes as part of AUKUS. Annual reporting would facilitate legislative action in support of AUKUS and the broader bilateral relationship. This report would ideally be public, with a classified annex as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of State should conduct a rigorous and proactive outreach campaign to inform industry about the specific requirements of the 2024 new AUKUS waiver; Austrade should establish a pipeline to refer companies to the Defence Export Controls office to provide clear messaging and education to industry about ITAR rules and boundaries. ITAR is managed by the State Department and is generally regarded as exceptionally complex and difficult to understand. Both governments’ direct messaging and education on ITAR could help overcome industry’s inclination to be more conservative than the rules require.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-economic-barriers&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Economic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic barriers to defense industrial cooperation are mainly the product of uncertain returns for vendors supporting international cooperation, which make it difficult to justify addressing the forms of friction introduced by borders. A common kind of friction is the difficulty of incorporating a foreign supplier into an established supply chain or the costs of establishing a subsidiary and building contacts in a distant foreign nation. Insufficient incentives undercut the role the U.S. and Australian defense industrial bases can play in support of defense cooperation. Barriers to international cooperation can resemble those of small or non-traditional U.S. vendors. The lack of a perceived “front door” access for AUKUS applicants complicates what would otherwise be a comparatively easy path for Australian vendors that have established a U.S. subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defense industry groups in the AUKUS countries should consider creating an AUKUS-focused consortium. Consortia are often used to gather a set of vendors with a common interest, such as working with a particular technology or involving a standard or architecture. They can be an entry point for vendors and can ease the discovery process for government customers. The innovation-seeking acquisition mechanism Other Transaction Authority (OTA) arrangements often rely on consortia for ease of entry. However, because consortium management companies want to avoid export controls, many consortiums are limited to U.S. companies (including those with foreign headquarters). Yet, there is precedent for allowing international participants in U.S. consortia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The governments of Australia and the United Kingdom should consider subsidizing the overhead costs of establishing these AUKUS-focused consortia for AUKUS Pillar II topics. This would be similar to how the Canadian Commercial Corporation takes on the overhead burden for Canadian firms selling to the U.S. government. This step would allow smaller Australian firms to explore the U.S. market before taking the larger leap of establishing a U.S. subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. acquisition workforce should use Other Transaction Authority arrangements for AUKUS acquisition coordination. This approach would build on the success of AUKUS prize challenges by creating a mechanism to manage intergovernmental AUKUS procurement. As covered in previous recommendations, AUKUS procurement vehicles and consortiums could address some of the multifaceted barriers to business-to-government cooperation. Multinational procurement vehicles would require top acquisition personnel from all three countries to pool their expertise and address the considerable challenges of designing a vehicle that meets the need of all three systems. Despite requiring up-front costs, this approach could bear significant fruit by resolving the challenge of reconciling the rules of three different national acquisition systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Australian government should empower and provide additional funding to Austrade to enhance Australian industry understanding of the U.S. acquisition system and to aid Australian SMEs in establishing U.S. domestic subsidiaries. Building on its success assisting Australian firms through trade shows and personnel introductions, Austrade could also provide more detailed information on complex and lesser-known export options (e.g., EAR 600 and DSP5). Assistance with domestic U.S. subsidiaries would require Australian funding for firms in the United States, but this initiative would yield an overall benefit for Australian firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD should expand the training and education of its acquisition workforce to include the financial and bureaucratic complexities of working with international companies. DOD officials are occasionally unprepared for the bureaucratic requirements of paying foreign entities via international wires, despite the availability of existing mechanisms. Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) staff were also unfamiliar with constraints unique to Australian firms, such as time zone differences and the difficulty of rapid travel to the United States. Small Australian firms reported funding difficulties created by slow payments, vague programs, and shifting deadlines. More rigorous international cooperation training could be usefully paired with hiring more U.S. acquisition personnel to alleviate the challenge of incorporating Australian firms into the U.S. defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD and ADOD should embrace Modular Open Systems Approaches to lower barriers to entry and encourage competition. There is often the perception of industry gatekeeping by U.S. primes to prevent Australian firms from competing. U.S. law encourages the adoption of Modular Open Systems Approaches to the maximum extent practicable, though in practice more can be done. Private industry still retains key intellectual property under these arrangements, but the U.S. government has the ability to bring in new competitors, for example, by holding a competition for Australian vendors to compete to support an existing system built on open architectures that are accessible to Australians firms. This option would also be available to the Australian government when purchasing systems using Modular Open Systems Approaches from the United States or when employing such open standards in their own systems, even when developing them with international partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concluding-thoughts-1&quot;&gt;Concluding Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing defense industrial cooperation between Australia and the United States will take concerted efforts by government and industry from both nations. Senior government leaders need to reaffirm the importance of this integration through policy pronouncements and regular reviews. Ensuring that business practices and industry and government culture support cooperation will require both resources and a thoughtful requirement-setting process that enhances opportunities for collaboration. Simple solutions and single policy changes (e.g., “fix ITAR”) alone will not yield the results desired. To enhance cooperation outcomes, both systems must commit to a longer-term plan for change management, with a focus on sharing the strategic vision, providing necessary resources and training, and continually identifying and addressing barriers. Measuring and tracking cooperative activities can provide a useful metric to assess whether policy changes are having the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real and sustained change can only start once policymakers embrace a mindset that believes time is of the essence and that approaches the challenges of national and allied preparedness with a sense of urgency. The case for changing the model of defense industrial cooperation between the United States and Australia has been made and is widely acknowledged across both governments. Overcoming bureaucratic inertia to realize a tangible shift in how the U.S. and Australian industrial bases integrate, however, demands greater commitment. Given new collaborations between Beijing, Moscow, Pyongyang, and Tehran, as well as the rapidly deteriorating security conditions globally and in the Indo-Pacific region specifically, allied deterrence must transform into a collective endeavor. Such an enterprise necessarily demands more integration and alignment of defense systems and industries. AUKUS provides a superb opportunity to expand defense industrial collaborations by revitalizing the U.S.-Australian alliance with a laser-like focus on industrial policy. The national security of both counties, and the stability of the region, might well depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方結束24日盤問 黎智英否認發布煽動刊物：一派胡言&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uKBAJt4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（3日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第142日審訊，黎智英第50日作供。在控方盤問下，黎否認鼓吹外國對中國實施科技禁運，並否認透過 Mark Simon，向時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧的助手 Mary Kissel 直接請求美國撤銷香港特殊地位、實施制裁和敵對行動。不過黎承認有說過美國應該在與中國貿易的時候將人權議題扣連。控方質疑，是為了美國利益而戰鬥，並非為香港爭取利益，反指黎為了美國的利益而犧牲香港和中國的利益。黎否認，堅稱他為香港爭取與美國共同擁有的價值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示完成盤問，前後歷時約24天。辯方則申請在周三（5日）開始進行覆問，並預料在一天內可完成，其後預料處理控辯雙方承認事實及專家證供等。辯方並表示料於6月中結案陳詞，會與控方商討具體日子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認鼓吹外國對中國實施科技禁運&quot;&gt;黎否認鼓吹外國對中國實施科技禁運&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續圍繞黎有否鼓吹科技制裁或禁運提問。控方指，在2020年9月至12月期間，黎分別在專欄文章和網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」裡，至少七度提及向中國實施科技禁運或制裁。黎反稱他只是分析當時狀況，又指科技禁運是當時已經發生的事，他無法鼓吹。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 副刑事檢控專員 周天行&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎不只是陳述事實，而是重複強調科技先進的重要性及科技禁運對中國造成的影響，黎其實是在鼓吹外國對中國實施科技禁運。黎不同意，強調科技禁運當時已經發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎在節目使用dismember-否認倡分裂中國&quot;&gt;黎在節目使用「dismember」 否認倡分裂中國&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著圍繞黎有否鼓吹外國與中國貿易時，將非貿易相關議題扣連。在2020年11月29日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」中，節目嘉賓、美國記者兼時評作家 Nicholas Kristof 提到，有的人指稱美國替香港和黎發聲，是與「西方分裂中國（Western dismemberment）」有關。黎回應稱這論述「不完全是錯誤」，香港與自由世界抱持相同價值，是這些自由世界價值的堡壘，而對於中國來說這些是「危險」的思想，如果獲容許在中國散播的話，「必定可以分裂中國政權（it definitely can dismember the Chinese regime）」，這是中國如此進取地打壓香港的原因。黎又表示，希望拜登政府不只談論人權，而是作出行動，如果可以的話，在貿易談判中，將香港和新疆的人權、自由和法治議題扣連。在控方盤問下，黎確認上述主意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後表示，不認為特朗普只是基於人權議題而向中國實施禁運，而他希望拜登回復與中國貿易談判，並且希望談判能夠扣連香港和新疆的人權議題。控方問是否將人權議題作為先決條件？黎則稱是「一個組合（a package）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指出，黎在節目中使用的「dismember」一字，帶有分裂國家的意思。黎否認提倡西方分裂中國，並解釋稱當時使用「dismember」的意思是指中國與西方價值觀相異，不把中國視為國際社會一員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認希望拜登延續特朗普的強硬態度&quot;&gt;黎否認希望拜登延續特朗普的強硬態度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年12月1日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」中，黎稱拜登政府應該明白到，與中共交往時須以強硬態度而非軟弱或綏靖態度。控方質疑黎希望拜登盡可能對中國強硬。黎否認，強調只是陳述當時情況，不代表他希望拜登延續特朗普的強硬態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另指，2020年12月1日播出的《霍士新聞》訪問中，黎稱很多人想美國民主黨的拜登政府與中國談判時，將人權、法治、自由和新疆人權議題等，列為首要條件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎撰文稱迫使中國尊重人權-控方質疑為了給特朗普閱讀&quot;&gt;黎撰文稱迫使中國尊重人權 控方質疑為了給特朗普閱讀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示訊息紀錄，2019年8月7至8日期間，黎向 Mark Simon 傳送一篇時評文章的草稿，打算交給其教父兼《華爾街日報》編輯 Bill McGurn 。該草稿提及中國經濟正在衰退，同時面對美國貿易戰和科技禁運，這是一個良機迫使中國尊重人權，籲美國人向當地的議員寫信，利用制裁來阻止中國侵害香港的自由，舉例指拒絕向有份打壓香港的中港官員子女批出學生簽證，並在結尾提到：「我們已經清除奴隸制度，為何不清除暴政！（We have eliminated slavery, why not tyranny!）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰追問黎希望想清除哪一個暴政？是否指中共政府？黎同意。控方指，黎要求美國人清除中共？黎否認，強調他只是說「我們已經清除奴隸制度，為何不清除暴政」。控方問誰是「我們」，黎稱：「全人類。（Humanity.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，Mark Simon 於同年8月9日傳送訊息給黎：「Trump has pushed back. OAN is his new favourite channel. I was told to watch for something. This is it. It’s a response to WSJ piece. Crack down in HK, no trade talks, lots of pain coming.（特朗普剛推遲了（貿易談判）。OAN 是他最近喜歡的頻道，有人叫我去觀看。就這樣。這是一個對《華爾街日報》文章的回應。在香港的打壓，沒有貿易談判，大量痛苦來臨。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，「OAN」是否即是 One America News？黎稱不知道。控方指，訊息再一次證明 Mark Simon 獲得美國政府的內部消息，因他知道特朗普喜歡的頻道。控方又指，訊息稱「這是一個對《華爾街日報》文章的回應」，顯示黎的文章草稿是打算給特朗普看？黎稱不知道。法官李素蘭追問，特朗普的舉動是與黎刊登在《華爾街日報》的文章有關係？黎亦表示不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息稱美國撤銷香港特殊地位是正確-黎否認屬請求&quot;&gt;訊息稱美國撤銷香港特殊地位是「正確」 黎否認屬請求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著圍繞黎有否請求美國撤銷香港特殊地位提問。2020年7月15日，Mark Simon 轉發時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧的助手 Mary Kissel 的訊息，要求黎澄清對於撤銷香港特殊地位的立場。黎回覆：「我是說撤銷香港特殊地位是不需要的，因為在《國安法》下，香港怎樣也好都會完蛋。重點不在於香港而在於中國。制裁中國以阻止她打壓香港。但是就此思考後，我認為他們撤回香港特殊地位是正確的，因為一旦美國和中國之間脫鈎，香港會是中國的出口。若然關閉這個中國的出口的話，會更輕易地迫使中國回應美國的要求。（I said that it’s not necessary to revoke the special status of HK because with national security law HK is finished anyway. The point is not HK but China. Sanction China as to stop it from clamping down on HK. But after I thought about it I think they’re right to revoke HK’s special status, because once US and China decoupled HK would be a way out for China. To close this outlet of China would force it to come to term easier to demands of US.）」其後 Mark Simon 回覆：「謝謝，會傳達。（Thanks… will relay）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否支持美國撤銷香港特殊地位？黎相信當時美國已經撤銷香港特殊地位，因此不是「支持」，而是認同美國撤銷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，美國每年檢視香港情況而決定是否維持香港特殊地位，質疑從上述訊息可見，黎想美國繼續撤銷香港特殊地位。黎表示沒有這樣說過。法官李運騰指，黎在訊息稱香港是中國通往世界的出口，若然關閉這個出口的話，會更輕易地迫使中國回應美國的要求。李官問黎，若然中國一直不回應美國的要求，那麼黎便不想美國恢復香港的特殊地位？黎表示沒有想到這麼長遠，重申他只是說香港是中國通往世界的通道（conduit），若然關閉這個通道的話，中國會更易回應美國的訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎的訊息提及「制裁中國以阻止她打壓香港」，質疑黎的意思是既然《國安法》已經實施，「為何不撤銷香港特殊地位？」，因此黎的最終目的是制裁中國。控方又指，上述訊息是黎透過 Mark Simon，直接請求美國撤銷香港特殊地位。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎直接促請美國政府制裁中國，以制止中國打壓香港，又指黎向美國提倡針對中國的敵對行動。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎為美國而戰-犧牲香港和中國的利益&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎為美國而戰 犧牲香港和中國的利益&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎為了美國的利益而犧牲香港和中國的利益，而黎並非為香港爭取利益，一直以來他只是爭取美國的利益。黎否認，堅稱他是爭取香港的利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎不是說過「我們為與美國共同抱持的價值戰鬥」嗎？黎則表示，他是為了香港，而爭取與美國共同擁有的價值。控方追問，黎是為了美國而戰鬥？黎否認這樣說過，反指自己是在戰爭的前線戰鬥，為了與美國一致的價值戰鬥。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又質疑，黎發送訊息的時候，《國安法》經已實施，質疑黎並非如他所稱的謹慎。黎則堅稱他只是在訊息中回答問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱希望拜登繼續對中國採取毫不留情態度-惟否認希望制裁措施持續&quot;&gt;黎稱希望拜登繼續對中國採取毫不留情態度 惟否認希望制裁措施持續&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2020年11月29日，黎在專欄文章〈天下圍中 拜登騎虎難下〉中稱：「川普取消香港的特殊貿易地位⋯⋯此外又制裁某些協助中共鎮壓港人的官員，要他們承受個人損失，令其他有可能參與鎮壓的官員多一重顧慮，對中共肆意鎮壓港人或多或少有個牽制作用，令為國安法蹂躪喘不過氣來的港人感到有人為我們出氣而寄存希望。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎希望針對中國的制裁措施能夠持續。黎否認。控方續指，黎在文章中強調制裁對於官員的負面作用，想突出制裁對中國的不利效果。黎同意有提及過，但否認是提倡。控方又問，對於黎而言，美國制裁中共官員是否令他感到有人替他「出氣」？黎認同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，文章的網上版本新增了一些段落，當中稱：「有人說拜登比川普更重視人權，會更關心香港人的抗爭運動，言辭上的確或如此，但政客從來講一套做又是另一套，而行動方為最實際。與中共談判緩和貿易戰，拜登倘能以香港的法治、自由和新疆的人權狀況為談判的先決條件，那就功德無量了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否想拜登繼續對中國採取毫不留情（relentless）的態度？黎表示：「我希望。」控方指，在《國安法》生效之後，黎有繼續提倡制裁。黎否認提倡制裁，但承認有說過美國應該在與中國貿易的時候將人權議題扣連。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱沒說過中共應該低頭和拚死一戰&quot;&gt;黎稱沒說過中共應該「低頭」和「拚死一戰」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2021年6月6日的《蘋果》社評〈美國離間中俄，中共有苦自知〉，由筆名「方圓」的顏純鈎撰寫。控方引述其中一段：「拜登爭取普京中立，已經贏了一大半，此後西方各強國齊心，脅迫中共遵守國際規則，又在經濟和科技上圍堵，中共遲早吃不消。到最後，除了低頭，也只有拚死一戰了。」控方問黎，上述段落是否與黎的想法一致？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱文章與他的想法相似，但是非完全一致，因他沒有說過中共應該「低頭」和「拚死一戰」。控方質疑，黎在早上不是說過想「清除暴政」嗎？黎稱只是說過想清除暴政而非指明中共。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎當時知道顏的文章有意引起對政府的憎恨、蔑視和不滿；有意慫使他人不守法；以及有意請求外國針對中國進行敵對行動。黎一概否認，並重申他不是作者也不是發布者，該文章與他無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方最後指出案情-黎一概否認一派胡言&quot;&gt;控方最後指出案情 黎一概否認：「一派胡言」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後總結案情，指在2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日期間，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，與張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗、馮偉光、楊清奇、Mark Simon、張志偉、李兆富和其他不知名人士，一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及或複製煽動刊物，包括161篇涉案文章，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎沉默數秒後，回答：「當然不同意。」，並指：「一派胡言！（Totally rubbish!）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」，控方指黎及3間涉案公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日期間，與張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗、馮偉光、楊清奇、Mark Simon、張志偉、李兆富和其他不知名人士一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員，對中國或香港特區實施制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎與上述涉案人士之間達成請求外國制裁的協議，是從2019年3至4月開始，直至2021年6月24日結束。黎則稱控方編造故事，堅稱沒有協議，反問：「我怎樣同意？」，其後表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎面對的另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」，控方指黎於2020年7月1日至2021年2月15日期間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸、IPAC 創辦人裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）、時任日本議員菅野志櫻里、英國金融家 Bill Browder 及其他不知名人士串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，對中國或香港特區實施制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。黎表示：「我連李宇軒是誰也不知道」，又批評控方編造故事然後來問他是否同意。黎最終表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎與上述涉案人士的協議，最遲從2020年1月開始，其後持續，直至2021年2月15日結束。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方完成盤問-辯方料覆問需時一天&quot;&gt;控方完成盤問 辯方料覆問需時一天&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示沒有進一步問題，意味控方完成盤問。辯方代表大律師關文渭表示，希望在周三才開始進行覆問，因需時整理覆問流程；此外，就著控方指稱黎的文章和言論欠缺事實基礎，辯方從網上公開資料搜尋到相關事實基礎，希望在覆問之前，將該些材料交給控方檢視，因此希望押後至周三，並且預料一天內能夠完成覆問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示，黎完成作供之後，預料會處理控辯雙方承認事實、有關通訊軟件中轉發訊息功能的專家證供，以及有關網上下載公開紀錄的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方資深大律師彭耀鴻則表示，將會與控方商討結案陳詞日子，若然雙方各自需時六星期撰寫書面陳詞的話，可能會在6月回來法庭作口頭陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that cumulative capital spending in the most aggressive scenario could reach $2.35 trillion by 2030, with compute deployment reaching 7.0E+30 total floating-point operations (FLOP) and power demands adding 83.7 gigawatts (GWs) to the U.S. grid. While financing appears manageable with U.S. capital markets, and graphics processing unit (GPU) production constraints seem surmountable through technological advancement, the unprecedented scale of electrical power demands—equivalent to adding a new state the size of Texas to the grid—poses significant infrastructure and policy challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) rapidly became the focus of technology sector investment after the release of ChatGPT 3.5 in November of 2022. Since then, genAI has consistently captured the attention and resources of industry leaders, solidifying its place as a transformative technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projections for genAI investment are staggering. Sam Altman, CEO of the leading genAI provider OpenAI, has reportedly discussed creating a $7 trillion fund for genAI investment before 2030. Such an enormous number underscores industry leaders’ confidence in the transformative potential of genAI for the technology sector and the global economy. Nvidia, the leading producer of GPUs that provide compute for genAI, saw its revenue grow from $5 billion in the last quarter of fiscal year 2021 to $35 billion in the final quarter of FY 2024. This growth has been fueled by the increasing demand for advanced computational hardware capable of handling the exponential increase in genAI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parallel to the rapid increase in investment in GPUs, the electricity sector has seen a jump in power demand. Like factories or refineries, data centers attempt to maximize the return on capital by operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as close to full capacity as possible. A new data center can demand as much as one GW of constant power, and the genAI industry plans to increase the scale and quantity of new data centers added every year. As of 2024, the additional demand from data centers has already reversed a six-decade-long trend of falling growth. Estimates of future demand have been revised sharply upwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debut of DeepSeek’s R1 model introduced a significant shift in the genAI landscape. When delivering cutting-edge performance at a fraction of the computational cost compared to frontier models, R1 has fueled speculation that hyperscale data centers may no longer be the limiting factor in genAI progress. Some argue that the trillion-dollar arms race in genAI infrastructure could prove unnecessary if leading models can be trained and deployed with dramatically lower resource requirements. Yet, among industry leaders, there is little indication that infrastructure investment plans are being scaled back. Rather than being viewed as a cap to genAI’s expansion, DeepSeek’s efficiency gains are understood as a catalyst for even more aggressive genAI deployment. Moreover, lower costs do not imply diminishing demand; instead, they further extend the frontier of what is economically viable, broadening genAI’s reach across industries and accelerating its integration into the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly announced Stargate Project, a $500 billion investment led by OpenAI in partnership with SoftBank and Oracle, reinforces this interpretation. Stargate represents the largest genAI infrastructure initiative to date, with plans for a vast network of hyperscale data centers across the United States. If DeepSeek’s breakthrough demonstrated that state-of-the-art genAI can be achieved more efficiently, Stargate underscores that the response from key players is to expand investment, not to temper it. The fundamental premise remains unchanged: No matter how rapidly genAI efficiency improves, the demand for compute continues to scale beyond prior projections. Far from reducing the need for capital expenditure, cost declines in training and inference are expected to unlock new applications, driving even more infrastructure buildout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securing dominance in genAI has emerged as a focus for U.S. policymakers, who see it as vital for maintaining economic leadership and safeguarding national security. Achieving such dominance requires capitalizing on the transformative benefits of genAI and ensuring that the United States can train and deploy the most advanced genAI models in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we describe a model designed to explore the following questions: Will the recent acceleration in genAI growth continue over the short, medium, and long term, and, if so, does the United States have the economic capacity and infrastructure to support that growth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our model connects three possible constraints on the growth of the U.S. genAI industry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financing:&lt;/strong&gt; Could the sheer cost of capital hinder genAI development and deployment?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware:&lt;/strong&gt; Could the production and supply of specialized genAI hardware, particularly GPUs, create bottlenecks?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electric Power:&lt;/strong&gt; Could the energy demands of genAI models and supporting infrastructure outpace available resources?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three illustrative scenarios represent different durations over which the post-ChatGPT acceleration in genAI growth might last:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Industrial Revolution:&lt;/strong&gt; eight or more years&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The PC Explosion:&lt;/strong&gt; five years&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dot-Com Boom:&lt;/strong&gt; two years&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most aggressive scenario is modeled after the growth experienced during the Second Industrial Revolution—between 1870 and 1914—when electricity, Bessemer steel, and internal combustion engines fundamentally altered the nature of production. If genAI facilitates this level of economic transformation, we expect the investment in genAI to continue at its present rate over the next decade and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that leading AI labs are raising hundreds of billions of dollars in capital based on an anticipated transformation of this magnitude. We include two additional scenarios because market expectations have been thwarted in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first alternative scenario is modeled after the PC revolution. The development of personal computers revolutionized the business sector and radically altered the nature of clerical work but did not dramatically transform the US economy. A similar path for genAI might mean that industries like software development and media are completely overhauled, but the rest of the economy sees only modest adjustments. In that case, we would expect the period of rapid genAI investment that began in 2023 to continue until 2028 before petering out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second alternative scenario is modeled after the dot-com boom. While interest in internet-centric companies began in 1995, the lion’s share of venture capital investment occurred between the last two quarters of 1999 and the first two quarters of 2021. If AI takes a similar trajectory, the surge in investment that began in late 2023 is now coming to a close. This scenario defies most conventional wisdom but is crucial as a robustness check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-results&quot;&gt;Scenario Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We offer some representative top-line results from our model below. Table 1 displays cumulative totals relative to 2022 for each scenario. The three categories of capital spending, compute deployed in total FLOP, and GWs added are the aggregate demand metrics for each of the three enablers, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XP1WcWh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Key Metrics in 2030&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three categories of Capital Spending, Compute Deployed in total Flops, and GWs added are our aggregate demand metrics for each of our three enablers, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began by projecting recent investment trends using census data from 2014 to 2024 to create coherent scenarios across these three metrics. We then used trends in the decline in GPU prices to estimate the number of GPUs purchased annually consistent with that projection. Finally, we employed trends in power efficiency to calculate the additional power required by our projection of yearly GPU growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gave us a mathematical relationship linking investment, GPUs, and power at the macro level. Because individual data centers are rated by their power usage, we were able to use proprietary microdata provided by Semianalysis to calibrate our macro-level relationship to actual fine-grained deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financing&quot;&gt;Financing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capital availability has been robust, with major players such as tech giants, venture capitalists, and governments prioritizing genAI investments. However, some analysts are concerned that genAI’s revenue generation will not be sufficient to sustain the large profit margins technology companies have had to this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proprietary analysis of greenfield projects indicates that the six firms currently leading in genAI investment collectively expect growth to continue at this pace in the foreseeable future. This is consistent with public statements made by the CEOs of those companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to evaluate whether this growth is financially sustainable by treating financing data centers like industrial investments. Datacenter creation involves a sizable industrial investment in physical chips and infrastructure. Interest and depreciation will govern the overall cost of such an investment. Additionally, the power needs of data centers will be operational costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrying costs are what an industrial firm expects to pay yearly to maintain its physical plant, machines, and other equipment. These types of expenses are dominated by the interest payments on the original construction and the loss of worn-out and obsolete physical structures, machines, and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a five-year straight-line depreciation schedule and a financial cost of 300 basis points over the ten-year treasury, we find that, assuming present trends continue, the total carrying cost of capital would rise from roughly $30 billion in 2024 to $430 billion in 2030 in the most optimistic scenarios for genAI development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$430 billion is an eye-popping number, but it must be considered in context. In 2023, U.S. businesses spent $5.2 trillion on interest and depreciation alone. The long-term, economy-wide interest and depreciation growth trend is 5 percent per year. Assuming this trend holds, that number will reach $7.3 trillion in 2030, a gain of $2.1 trillion in six years. Adding the $430 billion genAI will cost would increase that change by less than 20 percent to $2.5 trillion, a substantial, but not impossible, boost. Looking at it another way, accommodating the genAI increase would require spending on depreciation and interest to grow by 6.4 percent a year rather than 5 percent. For comparison, that is roughly equal to the growth rate in interest and depreciation from $1.27 trillion in 1993 to $1.97 trillion in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, there is little indication that the carrying cost of genAI will be an unbearable strain on U.S. capital markets. Although a complete analysis of whether the industry-specific gains from that investment outweigh the costs is well beyond the scope of this paper, we can provide some benchmarks for realism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, productivity gains from genAI seem promising in software engineering. This may be because genAI firms tailor their models specifically to be helpful to themselves, which may suggest that tailoring for other industries could produce widespread gains over time. Assuming the current pattern holds, how much productivity gain would software engineering have to see to “pay for” the depreciation and interest on computing facilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest that by 2030, the total wage bill of software engineers in the United States will exceed $1 trillion. These estimates are based on historical numbers and do not include the effects of genAI. With this estimated wage bill, genAI would need to increase the productivity of the average software engineer by 42 percent to cover the cost of depreciation and interest. Put simply, if in 2030, genAI could allow U.S. companies to hire 40 percent fewer software engineers and produce the same output, that alone could justify the cost of depreciation and interest for the entire genAI industry. As a last heuristic, if genAI is used primarily for entertainment, and roughly 20 percent of residents in the developed world signed up for a genAI streaming service, then the cost of capital would amount to approximately $160 a month per subscription. GenAI would have to be roughly as appealing as cable television to justify depreciation and interest costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gpu-availability&quot;&gt;GPU Availability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyze the potential problems posed by GPU production, we took our baseline capital expenditure estimates and calculated how much chip production would be implied. This required several steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the state-of-the-art GPU is the H100, produced by Nvidia. We define an H100 equivalent as a hypothetical GPU in any given year that produces the same compute as a current H100 using state-of-the-art technology for that year. Thus, we expect the cost of H100 equivalents to decline precipitously over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed of that decline is a matter of contention. Nvidia’s CEO points out that GPU performance nearly doubles every year. However, critics say that this ignores the fact that Nvidia’s chips have become larger over time, thus representing more silicon and higher production costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epoch AI estimates that the cost per FLOP (a technical metric of GPU performance) halves every 2.5 years. However, this estimate does not include the effect of algorithmic efficiency. Essentially, better genAI algorithms reduce the hardware cost of each computation, thus boosting the total computations that any GPU can perform within a given period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Fist and Arnab Datta at the Institute for Progress estimate that performance per dollar triples roughly every two years using hardware and algorithmic computing. This metric is consistent with our field reading and is the basis for our model H100 equivalents. Consequently, we assume that the cost per H100 equivalent will drop by 48 percent per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on Semianlaysis and Census Bureau data, we estimate that the GPU’s cost is two to three times the full cost, including facilities, installation, cooling, etc. Moreover, the non-GPU costs depend on how many megawatts (MWs) of power are used. Therefore, in order to arrive at a consistent figure over time, we must determine how watts per H100 equivalent evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, we turned to data from researchers at Northeastern University, which suggest that energy efficiency per square millimeter of silicon falls by 28 percent annually. Since our H100 equivalent has a fixed amount of silicon, we can use 28 percent as our energy efficiency trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using that rate of efficiency decline, we multiply the H100 equivalent per MW times the H100 equivalent price to find the GPU energy cost for a single MW facility. This allows us to match the energy cost for facilities and GPUs in any given year. We then calculate the gross MWs added in any given year as capital spending divided by the price per MW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our baseline capital spending estimates show that gross MWs increased from 3,000 in 2024 to 39,000 in 2030. We use that figure to calculate the number of H100 equivalents, estimating that the wattage per H100 equivalent will have fallen from 1,400 in 2024 to 249 in 2030. Thus, the total H100 equivalents should climb from 2.9 million in 2024 to 159 million in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To validate our estimate, we turn to a brief analysis of semiconductor manufacturing. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has a 90 percent market share in state-of-the-art GPUs. Although there is substantial evidence that other microchip manufacturers are ramping up GPU production capabilities to match the sharply increasing demand, we focus solely on TSMC’s capacity to be conservative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epoch AI projects that TSMC’s total silicon wafer production will reach 300–900 million H100 equivalents by 2030. Based on our projection of capital spending on H100 equivalents, the genAI industry must use between 15 and 50 percent of TSMC’s total capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers are significant but entirely plausible, given that TSMC is a state-of-the-art manufacturer and genAI is a state-of-the-art application. In the worst-case scenario, most of TSMC’s non-AI customers will be priced out and forced to depend on less advanced producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis has one large caveat: It does not account for a severe non-economic bottleneck—specifically, warfare on the island of Taiwan. Identifying the military and diplomatic options available to prevent or mitigate such an outcome is beyond the scope of this paper. Still, it’s important to note that the conclusions of this study depend on the continued supply of Taiwanese semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electric-power&quot;&gt;Electric Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the number of H100 equivalents installed in any given year has been determined, calculating the power requirement is simple. The depreciation of GPUs eliminates the power demand that would have come from worn-out, unusable chips. With the same 5-year straight-line depreciation used above to calculate MWs, the total power requirement rises from 4,000 MW in 2024 to 84,000 MW in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This figure implies unprecedented growth for the data center industry and a profound change in the overall growth trajectory for the U.S. electric power sector. In 2024, the peak electricity demand in the United States was 745 GW, which has not changed significantly in over a decade. For context, the electricity demand for genAI technology will exceed that of most states: peak demand for New York is about 33 GW (summer 2023), and the all-time peak for CAISO, the California power grid, is 52 GW (September 2022). In 2024, the primary grid operator in Texas, ERCOT, hit its peak production at 85 GW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our model’s demand estimates are roughly in line with forecasts generated by other research teams. A 2024 study by LBNL, which takes a detailed “bottom-up” approach estimating the energy usage of GPUs and other IT infrastructure, shows that total U.S. data center demand could grow from a base of roughly 40 GW in 2024 to 74–132 GW by 2028, that is, an increase in demand of 34–92 GWs in four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably for policymakers, this model’s 80 GW production excludes any additional drivers of electric demand growth, such as enterprise, cloud service computation, and crypto mining, each seeing growth, albeit at a slower rate than genAI. Other considerable sources of demand growth include the expansion of electricity-intensive industries—e.g., semiconductor fabrication and battery manufacturing—and the slow but sure increase in electric vehicles. Together, these demand drivers could easily contribute an additional 50-plus GWs of peak load to the grid by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant sources of uncertainty for our projections are whether the electricity supply and the requisite grid infrastructure can be deployed quickly enough to meet this increased demand. The reliability imperative retains ultimate priority in the power sector, so utilities and grid operators across the United States will only connect and serve demand resources they can reliably supply. This energy supply constraint is present in the data center development sector as well, where “speed-to-power”—how fast a site can receive energy—has rapidly emerged as the most critical factor driving siting and investment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A host of well-documented factors constrain the rapid scaling of supply in the power sector, including heavily backlogged generation interconnection queues, median wait times for new projects reaching over five years in 2023, persistent hurdles to the crucial high-voltage transmission expansion necessary to support new generation and demand, and the poor permitting environment for infrastructure of all types. In addition, crucial equipment like transformers and gas turbines are increasingly on multi-year backorders, further increasing project delays and costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the mid-1970s, all U.S. electric power sector aspects—commercial, policy, and regulatory—have adapted to slowing growth rates. Over the last two decades, moreover, growth has been effectively zero. However, with the crucial national security loads of genAI at the forefront, the new paradigm of surging electric demand growth requires a new model of ambitious policymaking at both the state and federal levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major policy questions include addressing back-logged interconnection queues, accelerating transmission system expansion, streamlining the permitting environment, resolving the thorny issue of gas-electric coordination, and expanding the federal government’s role in unlocking new nuclear construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis suggests that the recent acceleration in genAI growth could continue through 2030, but with significant infrastructure challenges that must be addressed. Examining three potential constraints—financing, hardware availability, and electric power demands—we find that while the first two obstacles appear surmountable, the unprecedented scale of electrical power requirements poses the most serious challenge to sustained growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a financing perspective, even our most aggressive scenario, requiring $2.35 trillion in cumulative capital spending by 2030, appears manageable within U.S. capital markets. The projected annual carrying costs of $430 billion by 2030 would represent less than 20 percent of the expected growth in economy-wide interest and depreciation. Moreover, our analysis suggests that relatively modest productivity gains in the software engineering sector alone could justify these capital costs, with a 42 percent increase in productivity sufficient to cover the industry’s depreciation and interest expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardware constraints, particularly GPU availability, also appear manageable given expected technological advances and manufacturing capacity. Our projections indicate that the genAI industry would require between 15 percent and 50 percent of TSMC’s total manufacturing capacity by 2030—a substantial but feasible share. However, this assessment assumes continued access to Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing, highlighting a critical geopolitical vulnerability in the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant challenge to sustained genAI growth lies in meeting its unprecedented electrical power demands. Our model projects that genAI technology will require approximately 84 GW of power by 2030—equivalent to adding another Texas to the U.S. grid. This dramatic increase in power demand, combined with other growing sectors such as electric vehicles and semiconductor manufacturing, will require a fundamental transformation of the U.S. power sector, which has been oriented toward minimal growth since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical infrastructure bottlenecks threaten to impede this necessary scaling of power capacity. Addressing these challenges will require coordinated policy action at both state and federal levels, including reforms to permitting processes, transmission planning, and nuclear power development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while the United States possesses the economic capacity to support continued genAI growth through 2030, realizing this potential will require unprecedented coordination between industry and government to modernize and expand critical infrastructure, particularly in the power sector. The success of this endeavor will likely determine whether the United States can maintain its leadership position in genAI development and deployment. Future research should focus on detailed policy frameworks for accelerating power sector transformation while maintaining grid reliability and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰遂向庭內人士表示，不要騷擾法庭程序，即使法官已經離開法庭，而律師和被告仍在庭內的時候，旁聽人士不得發表他們的感受或想法；不論法官是否在場，均應該保持「絕對安靜」。杜官並指，任何人若然騷擾法庭程序，都會被要求離開正庭，只允許到庭外位置觀看實時直播，而他們不獲准再進入正庭。若果任何人不遵守法官命令，法庭保安會把有關人士的資料記錄下來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方補充指，警方已辨認出某些涉事人士，將會與法庭保安協商。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續盤問，指稱《國安法》生效前後，黎執意持續涉案行為。控方向黎出示網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」謄本，當中黎稱會繼續經營《蘋果》。控方質疑黎言論的背後意思是不管《國安法》的效力，《蘋果》都會「如常（as usual）」運作下去。黎否認，堅稱其意思是繼續營運下去、繼續努力（keep going and fighting），而沒有說過「如常」，因不會非法地營運下去，批評控方：「在這個公正的法庭裡，你這樣扭曲我！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰打斷黎，提醒他控方只是履行職責指出案情，黎只需回答同意或不同意，否則案件需審至明年。黎反指：「但是他（控方）把話塞進我的口中！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰向黎解釋，控方重述黎的說話，並以一種與黎有別的方式說出其案情，其實是一種對黎公平的做法，因控方指出其案情，然後黎不同意，那麼他們可以在結案陳情時處理相關議題；否則在結案陳詞階段，辯方會基於控方從未指出相關案情，而反對提出相關議題，因此這是控方的職責及對黎公平起見的做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎聽畢表示明白，並解釋：「我不習慣這種迫害（persecution）。」杜官隨即指正：「這不是迫害（persecution）！」黎其後表示：「對不起⋯⋯我不習慣這些程序。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認國安法後意圖非法地營運下去-我們不會自殺&quot;&gt;黎否認國安法後意圖非法地營運下去 「我們不會自殺」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎出示2020年9月27日的專欄文章〈繼續打壓香港 還是以身報國？〉，當中稱：「二百警察殺入蘋果日報大樓，大肆搜查檔案文件，更是警權侵犯新聞自由；旨在殺雞儆猴，震懾所有傳媒。經此一役，以後傳媒哪還敢不靠邊站？有人說『反中亂港』的壹傳媒仍未被冚檔，依然一貫方針報道新聞、發表言論，可見香港還有新聞自由。是的，我們照常運作，但我們每一天都要冒著被拉人封艇的風險。當你要提心吊膽寫東西、講說話時，你還自由嗎？自由是無憂無慮的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，從「是的，我們照常運作」一句，可見黎有意圖「照常」營運《蘋果》？黎否認，強調「照常」的是《蘋果》的「運作」，不代表他們會以非法的方式營運。控方引述文章提及：「有人說『反中亂港』的壹傳媒仍未被冚檔，依然一貫方針報道新聞、發表言論，可見香港還有新聞自由。」黎則強調是合法地營運下去，反問：「我們怎樣可以非法地營運下去？我們不是犯罪公司！」黎又指，因《國安法》生效後，過往的營運方式變成不合法，因此沒有人會以非法的方式經營下去，「誰人可以用非法的方式繼續經營？告訴我！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指文章稱：「當你要提心吊膽寫東西、講說話時，你還自由嗎？自由是無憂無慮的」，質疑《國安法》並非黎的關注。黎堅稱《國安法》是他們的關注，但是他們不能百份百肯定他們做的事情會否觸犯《國安法》，因紅線模糊。他又指，在《國安法》之下總是有風險，因他們不會知道他們使用的哪一個字眼是不合法，重申紅線不清晰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章提及「冒著被拉人封艇的風險」，控方指出黎有意圖繼續「照常」營運《蘋果》，包括一貫方針報道新聞、發表言論，而不管《國安法》的後果。黎稱：「這會是自殺式的事情。」控方追問黎同意還是不同意？黎表示：「我們不會自殺，當然不同意！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰引述文章稱警方「悍然修改」《警察通例》中「傳媒代表」的定義，做法明顯違憲，「可是違憲又怎樣？警權大曬呀！吹咩！」杜官指黎的說法基於錯誤的事實，加上警方乃基於搜查令而搜查壹傳媒大樓，惟黎未有在文章提及這事實，質疑黎有意向讀者呈現警方違憲和「警權大曬」等形象。黎否認這是他的意圖，反稱只是陳述他所見到的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方補充指，這是另一個例子，顯示黎作出毫無事實基礎的指控。黎否認沒有基礎，並稱《蘋果》是首個被警方搜查的傳媒。此時法官李運騰表示，記憶中曾發生過一次事件，當時《星島》被廉政公署搜查，因此《蘋果》並非第一間被搜查的傳媒。黎則稱不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年11月20日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」中，黎提到勾結外國勢力是大罪，「但是我要繼續及維護我們一直在做的事情，因為有那麼多人敬仰我。如果我退縮，他們也會退縮。」控方質疑黎執意繼續做非法的事情。黎則稱他不認為跟外國人談話是勾結外國勢力及違法，但是認為有相關風險，因為有可能被視為勾結，「所有事情都是有可能」、「你永遠不知道他們怎樣詮釋勾結罪。」他又指紅線是模糊，但是他知道有一些清晰的界線，他不會明知而做非法的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，黎知道跟外國人談話有風險，但是會冒險？因黎在節目中稱因為很多人敬仰他，所以他繼續一直在做的事情，並且不會退縮。黎則稱他不會做非法的事情，「但是我會在模糊的紅線之中冒險。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，既然黎知道有風險的話，「為什麼你不令自己遠離紅線？」黎回應：「如果你想爭取自由的話，你不能令自己遠離紅線。」李官問，黎準備冒險？黎同意，但強調不是做犯法的事情，而是冒險，又指如果他做犯法的事情便會是很愚蠢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問黎所做的事是否正如中文詞語「擦邊球」？黎同意當時是在「擦邊球」。控方問，所以在《國安法》之後，黎繼續冒險？黎同意，但重申：「我不能排除紅線的含糊性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方展示國安法後twitter帖文-黎稱惡行將有後果&quot;&gt;控方展示國安法後Twitter帖文 黎稱惡行將有後果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎展示數個《國安法》生效之後發表的 Twitter 帖文，其中2020年7月23日帖文談及美國勒令關閉侯斯頓（Houston）的中國領事館，並稱：「Trump is taking actions through different measures, while Biden can only make claims. Action is louder than words!（特朗普透過不同措施來作出行動，然而拜登只光說不做。行動勝千言萬語！）」控方質疑，縱使《國安法》生效後，黎持續請求制裁，而不如他早前所稱的謹慎。黎稱他只是談論已經發生的事情。控方續指，黎想制裁措施繼續。黎否認這樣說過，帖文沒有任何字眼有這種暗示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月23日帖文，轉載《蘋果》英文版新聞報導〈Firms with Hong Kong ties face US sanctions, linked to human rights abuses in Xinjiang（有香港聯繫的企業面臨美國制裁 扣連在新疆發生的人權侵犯）〉，並說：「The most effective way to prevent human rights violations is to hold people who do the heinous act personally accountable.（防止人權侵犯的最有效方法，是使作出劣行的人替其個人負責任。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，2020年9月17日的帖文，談及新民黨立法會議員葉劉淑儀撤走美國資產，並稱：「當美國人及全個自由世界都在聯成一線和實行制裁，中共的同謀無處可逃，而他們的資產也無處隱藏。他們迫害香港人的惡行將會有後果。（When American and the rest of the free world are aligned with and put in place sanctions. CCP’s accomplices have nowhere to turn, and their assets have nowhere to hide. Their evil deeds persecuting of HKers will have consequences.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎從沒有要求將上述帖文從其帳戶下架？黎確認沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認制裁在某程度上給予希望&quot;&gt;黎否認制裁在某程度上給予希望&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2020年11月29日，黎發表專欄文章〈天下圍中 拜登騎虎難下〉，當中稱：「川普取消香港的特殊貿易地位⋯⋯此外又制裁某些協助中共鎮壓港人的官員，要他們承受個人損失，令其他有可能參與鎮壓的官員多一重顧慮，對中共肆意鎮壓港人或多或少有個牽制作用，令為國安法蹂躪喘不過氣來的港人感到有人為我們出氣而寄存希望。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑黎透過文章，來強調制裁可以令官員有多一重顧慮及帶來牽制作用，是不是在請求外國制裁能夠繼續？黎強調只是陳述已經發生了的事情，以及「感到有人為我們出氣而寄存希望」。控方追問，黎認為制裁是希望？黎僅稱：「希望是希望」，重申只是提及已發生了的事情。控方又問，黎認為制裁在某程度上給予他希望嗎？黎否認，反指是因為見到有人為他們站起來，所以給他帶來希望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;twitter帖文問選舉主任應負責任嗎-黎否認請求制裁&quot;&gt;Twitter帖文問選舉主任應負責任嗎？ 黎否認請求制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月7日，美國財政部宣佈制裁11名侵犯人權及損害香港自治的中港官員，包括時任特首林鄭月娥。同日黎向「徒弟」李兆富傳送訊息：「But how about those election PRO (主任)? Should they be personally responsible for DQ candidates for political reasons?」黎庭上稱，當時只是詢問李，選舉主任是否已被制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示8月8日的 Twitter 帖文：「那些取消候選人資格的選舉主任又如何呢？他們應該在個人方面為這些決定負責任嗎？（How about those election officers (選舉主任) who disqualified #DQ the candidate nominations? Should they be personally responsible for making the decisions?）」控方指帖文顯示黎在《國安法》生效後，繼續請求外國制裁。黎不同意，又稱只是說選舉主任應該負責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認鼓吹對中國實施科技制裁&quot;&gt;黎否認鼓吹對中國實施科技制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示接著圍繞黎有否鼓吹科技制裁或禁運提問。2020年9月24日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」中，黎指若果中國被制裁的話，將難以研發製造晶片的技術，對科技和經濟造成打擊，屆時台灣在製造半導體的角色便會變得更重要，成為「亞洲版矽谷（Asia Silicon Valley）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年10月1日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，黎形容外國跟隨美國的制裁措施，禁止進口晶片科技到中國，是「做了正確的事情」。控方質疑黎認為向中國實施科技禁運是「正確的事情」。黎稱僅評論已經發生的事情。控方又問黎希望相關措施能夠持續嗎？黎多次強調自己沒有沒有資格想或不想美國做任何事。在追問下，黎稱自己沒有想過這個問題。控方指出，黎有意圖或希望美國對中國實施科技制裁。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2020年10月11日黎的專欄文章〈台灣也要感謝黨〉，當中提到：「美國對中國的高科技和晶片封鎖，也將牽制西方陣營和日本澳洲等國家，封鎖他們出口高科技和晶片到中國。這將大大打擊中國經濟發展和科技研發。含有晶片和外國科技零件配合的產品將停產，這不僅影響經濟发展，軍事和對人民電子監控的發展也會局部停頓。」黎否認在文章中提倡科技制裁，強調只是說出當時狀況和作出分析。黎並否認提倡科技制裁要持續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

What are the president’s options for reducing U.S. oil prices?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since his second term began on January 20, 2025, President Trump has clearly signaled a desire for lower oil prices. Executive orders, including “Unleashing American Energy,” as well as his remarks to the Davos World Economic Forum audience on January 23, outline Trump’s case for bringing down the price of oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the obvious direct advantage of reducing costs for consumers and businesses, Trump has associated the benefits of lower energy prices with two strategic priorities: first, as an instrument for taming inflation. Trump believes that a lower energy price environment will pave the way for the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates and stimulate economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Trump has asserted that lower oil prices will hasten an end to the war in Ukraine, ostensibly because Moscow would be deprived of oil export revenues sufficient to sustain its war effort. This reason, however, may have been superseded by recent events, including a February 12 phone call between Trump and Putin, a bilateral meeting of advisors in Riyadh on February 18, and Trump’s February 24 prediction that the war could end within a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-oil-price-does-trump-prefer&quot;&gt;What Oil Price Does Trump Prefer?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At an October 21, 2024, campaign rally in Greenville, NC, Trump said of U.S. energy prices, “We’re going to get your prices down so low. We’re going to get them down 50 percent.” This may have included a bit of election campaign hyperbole, seeing as crude oil and gasoline prices that day were $71 per barrel and $3.14 per gallon, respectively, implying targets of $36 per barrel and $1.57 per gallon were the 50 percent reduction applied literally to the price of oil. Moreover, Trump was speaking about energy prices in general, not crude oil and gasoline per se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump is surely mindful that oil prices were substantially lower during his first administration than those that prevailed both before and after. The price of benchmark US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged just $58 per barrel during Trump’s first term (excluding 2020).1 This was $17 (or 24 percent) lower than the $70 per barrel that prevailed during Obama’s second term (2013–16), and $26 (33 percent) lower than the $79 average price during the Biden administration (2021–24).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the three-year period from 2017 to 2019, the $58 average price of WTI crude oil coincided with an annual inflation rate of just 2.1 percent and an annual federal funds interest rate of 1.5 percent. It is reasonable, then, to assume Trump favors a WTI price below $60 in hopes of replicating those favorable macroeconomic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If $60 constitutes Trump’s upper limit, what about the lower boundary? Here the outlier year of 2020 is instructive, as oil prices apparently fell too low for even Trump’s preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, global oil demand plunged an astounding ten percent as economic activity sharply retreated due to worldwide pandemic shutdowns. At the same time, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers (OPEC+) failed to agree on oil supply targets, effectively ending its March ministerial meeting with a “free for all” that saw Saudi Arabia and Russia ramp up output in a short-lived market share war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As oil prices nosedived (WTI futures famously fell below $0 for the first time ever on April 20, 2020), US oil companies faced the prospect of severe losses and appealed for political intervention to increase oil prices. Trump is credited with brokering a deal between Riyadh and Moscow to restore production limits; the arrangement stanched the price collapse and paved the way for a rebound. Prices came back to $40 in April 2020 and held there for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the current oil price in the $70 range clearly too high and early 2020s prices below $40 too low, it can be inferred that Trump prefers WTI to range from $40 to $60 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-can-reduce-oil-prices&quot;&gt;Who Can Reduce Oil Prices?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump is looking to two sources of potential supply increases in his campaign to drive oil prices lower: the U.S. oil industry and the OPEC+ coalition. He has so far taken very different approaches toward these two audiences: aggressively slashing regulations to incentivize domestic production increases, and publicly castigating OPEC+ for withholding supply from the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unleashing-us-energy-resources&quot;&gt;Unleashing U.S. Energy Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s preliminary executive orders on energy read like a wish list for the U.S. oil patch. Nearly all of the industry’s longstanding policy asks are included: rolling back costly oilfield emission controls, liberalizing permit applications for drilling on federal lands and in offshore waters, a commitment to step up oil and gas lease sales, and reopening the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to exploration activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these measures are not likely to move the needle on U.S. oil and gas production anytime soon. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts U.S. crude oil will grow just 520 thousand barrels per day (kb/d) (4 percent) during the next two years, through 2026. Although this forecast was made before the executive orders were published, there is little sign that the U.S. exploration and production (E&amp;amp;P) industry is eager to exploit the aforementioned opportunities. Companies are not discussing and publicizing plans for significantly expanding E&amp;amp;P activities in Alaska or the Outer Continental Shelf. And if they did pursue new E&amp;amp;P opportunities in these areas, it would be years before new production affected global balances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1bOPo85.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: U.S. Crude Oil Growth Trajectory.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Short Term Energy Outlook, February 2025, Table 3D.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the objective is to return U.S crude oil production to high single-digit percent annual growth as seen in 2022–23, there is cause for pessimism. Those years were outliers unlikely to be repeated, primarily for geological reasons but also because of capital investment constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, U.S. production was still rebounding from the low levels sustained during the pandemic downturn. The extraordinary 1 million barrel per day (mb/d) (8.6 percent) surge in U.S. oil production in 2023 was a one-off phenomenon that happened largely because privately held drillers drastically increased spending to gussy up their production profiles and enhance their attractiveness as acquisition targets. The capital they invested that year was obtained through windfall earnings from unusually high prices ($80 per barrel average) during the “Russia crisis” year of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By late 2023, the windfall profits had been spent, and much of the easy-to-access oil reserves had been exploited. The Permian Basin emerged as the only major remaining growth engine of U.S. supply, with other previously prolific shale plays like North Dakota’s Bakken and South Texas’s Eagle Ford well below their peak output levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With reduced prospects for profitability compared to shale’s heyday in the 2010s, the U.S. oil patch moved toward consolidation, with major deals announced in late 2023 by ExxonMobil to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources and by Chevron to acquire Hess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ep-investors-demand-capital-discipline&quot;&gt;E&amp;amp;P Investors Demand Capital Discipline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s strategy posits that overturning federal government regulations facing the oil and gas industry and expediting drilling permits will incentivize operating companies to surge output. To wit, the “Unleashing” executive order asserts that “burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations have impeded the development of” U.S. energy resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assumption downplays the most important above-ground (non-geological) feature of today’s U.S. oil industry: Wall Street, not government regulation, is the limiting factor for U.S. supply growth. Investor mandates, informed by supply-demand realities, have not allowed E&amp;amp;P companies to “drill baby drill” themselves into a supply overhang and reduced profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, U.S. E&amp;amp;P companies do not share Trump’s desire for lower oil and gas prices, which would negatively impact their financial performance. A recent survey conducted by the Dallas Branch of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank found that oil companies are expecting $71 per barrel WTI by the end of 2025 and $74 per barrel by the end of 2026. The branch’s Q1 2024 survey on the breakeven cost of U.S. oil production identified an average $64 per barrel and for some wells as high as $70—well above the $50 range that prevailed during the first Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were WTI to spend significant time in the $50 range, E&amp;amp;P profits would deteriorate and operators would further reduce capital expenditures on drilling and fracking new wells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. oil companies are mindful that domestic oil demand growth is barely treading water. EIA sees it slowing to 250 kb/d (1 percent) this year and to virtually zero in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ample appetite for U.S. crudes exists overseas, exports are not likely to materially exceed 5.5 mb/d, the current record-high level, unless projections for multiyear trade opportunities lead to investments in building new export facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With limited opportunities to expand crude marketing to domestic and international customers, operators are unlikely to materially increase production—at least according to the conventional playbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-the-equation&quot;&gt;Changing the Equation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should Trump’s aggressive deregulation fail to boost supply and lower prices, there are several cards he could play to shake up the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offer an oil and gas production tax credit.&lt;/strong&gt; The February 14, 2025, executive order establishing the National Energy Dominance Council obliquely references “incentives to attract and retain private sector energy-production investments.” A production tax credit (PTC) for hydrocarbons could potentially serve as one such novel incentive.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;PTCs are an established tool in the energy policy toolkit, used in recent years to boost production of energy from renewable sources like wind and solar projects. Trump could potentially use a new tax credit for traditional hydrocarbons to entice E&amp;amp;P companies to ramp oil and gas output beyond the level justified by supply and demand, as the financial benefit of reducing a company’s tax burden could potentially enable it to maintain expected shareholder returns.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One possible advantage of an oil and gas PTC would be to incentivize individual company performance over macro oil market stewardship. Presently, companies’ desire to avoid oversupplying the market is well aligned with their shareholders’ interests to distribute free cash flow instead of investing in drilling programs (more than already required by shale’s aggressive decline rates).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An oil and gas PTC could potentially decouple these elements—an individual company might be willing to overlook the macro supply consequences of ramping up production if the government reduces its tax burden enough to deliver a net financial improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the short term, this could increase competition among E&amp;amp;P firms to more aggressively market their oil and succeed in driving prices lower. Longer term, however, the laws of supply and demand will prevail, and with more supply offered into a market with limited demand, prices will (all else equal) eventually fall below breakeven prices, causing drillers to reduce output and prices to rebound.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggressively lobby drillers to join the supply-increase bandwagon.&lt;/strong&gt; While Trump and the oil and gas industry would seem to be the closest of allies, that could change if he comes to see drillers as impeding his economic plans. This was potentially foreshadowed by the Greenville campaign remarks, in which Trump said of oil and gas companies, “If they drill themselves out of business, I don’t give a damn.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Trump has previously berated corporate leaders who failed to comply with his policy prerogatives; the public lambasting of General Motors, Harley-Davidson, and Carrier come to mind, although the track record of success in those campaigns (judged by having nudged those companies into compliance) was mixed at best.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit or ban oil exports.&lt;/strong&gt; This option would be highly ironic for the U.S. oil industry that spent much of the last four years concerned that the Biden administration might impose restrictions on exports in an effort to reduce prices. Although the concept was flawed and prone to backfiring, the motivation to bring down high prices was understandable as crude oil had spiked above $120 per barrel and national gasoline pump prices hit $5.10 per gallon in June 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Throttling or halting U.S. refined product exports would immediately create an overhang of gasoline, diesel, and similar fuels in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, as the transportation modes to distribute those fuels to other parts of the country (pipeline, ship) are limited (which is why international export markets are so important for U.S. refiners and the E&amp;amp;P operators that supply them with crude oil). Refiners would respond by slashing refinery operations, causing producers to cut back on crude oil output. Any domestic fuel price reduction, which would be centered in the Gulf Coast, would therefore be short lived.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A similar dynamic would occur if crude exports were limited or banned. U.S. operators, shellshocked by the cutoff of their international customers that purchase 30 percent (4 mb/d) of total U.S. crude output, would immediately curtail output. In a severe overhang dynamic, some E&amp;amp;P companies would go out of business, manifesting Trump’s aforementioned remark from the October 21 campaign rally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pressuring-opec-plus-to-ramp-up-production&quot;&gt;Pressuring OPEC-Plus to Ramp Up Production&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his January 23, 2025, remarks to the audience at Davos, Trump chastised Saudi Arabia and OPEC for failing to increase oil supply and urged it to change course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You got to bring it down, which, frankly, I’m surprised they didn’t do before the election. That didn’t show a lot of love by them not doing it. I was a little surprised by that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But OPEC+ does not want lower oil prices. It has taken a very conservative stance on oil supply for more than two years, deferring an initiative to increase output multiple times since it was first announced in summer 2024 on account of weaker-than-expected demand. Its current plan calls for very small supply increases of about 120 kb/d per month beginning in April 2025 and lasting for 18 months, assuming demand and inventories continue signaling a need for extra volumes. For its part, Saudi Arabia has gone to great lengths to maintain unity within the OPEC+ coalition, and Riyadh has absorbed an outsized sacrifice in market share to hold back supply in support of stable prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s first choice to get more oil from the producer group is probably cutting one or more deals that incentivize Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the UAE to significantly increase output, despite this being adverse to U.S. drillers’ interests and despite the risk of a supply glut developing amid ongoing demand weakness in China. This could involve stepped up arms transactions and defense arrangements in the case of the Gulf states, and potentially even U.S. acquiescence to security terms in Europe that are favorable to Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If additional oil supplies are not forthcoming, Trump could turn more adversarial toward Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ members. This could take the form of threats to reduce arms provisions and military cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further up the “escalation ladder” would be moving the longstanding but dormant No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act (“NOPEC”) legislation that characterizes OPEC as a cartel and paves the way for antitrust litigation. The likelihood of reciprocal moves by Saudi Arabia and other members against the United States has loomed over this initiative since its inception and may deter implementation in this case too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-trump-priorities-are-at-odds-with-lower-prices&quot;&gt;Other Trump Priorities Are at Odds with Lower Prices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Trump’s signaled desire for lower oil prices is unmistakable, other related policy initiatives are neutral-to-bullish for oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enacting tougher sanctions on certain exporting countries, particularly Iran but potentially also Russia, Venezuela, and Iraq.&lt;/strong&gt; New sanctions and stricter enforcement of existing sanctions will remove some barrels from the market and tighten supply-demand balances—a conundrum recently experienced by the outgoing Biden administration. Even the first Trump administration showed leniency on sanctions against Iran with consideration to the inevitable market dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.&lt;/strong&gt; Trump has declared an intention to fully refill the reserve, which is approximately half full at around 350 million barrels today. There are both budgetary impediments (no money left for new purchases) and policy considerations (more sales are scheduled for 2026–31 as mandated by bipartisan agreement), but Trump can surely overcome these headwinds by lobbying the Republican-controlled Congress. The price effect of removing barrels from the commercial market (available to refineries) and placing them into the reserve would be bullish—working against Trump’s desire for lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As for setting expectations for a fast refill, the SPR’s “plumbing” is designed for very fast drawdowns (4.1 mb/d) but only slow fill rates. Theoretical fill capacity is 785 kb/d; the real rate is less because of ongoing maintenance and the status of each salt cavern at the four facilities. In round numbers, filling the reserve to its 714-million-barrel authorized maximum would likely take 18–27 months. Reducing or canceling the congressionally mandated sales could expedite the fill rate; if the sales remain on track the full refill would take longer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Levying tariffs on Mexico and Canada.&lt;/strong&gt; Trump’s threatened tariffs on energy from Mexico and Canada are slated to take effect on March 4, 2025. Tariffs on oil imports would increase costs for U.S. refiners; these costs will in turn be passed on to businesses and consumers in the form of higher fuel prices. Many economists expect tariffs to raise prices generally in the United States, a headwind in the struggle to tame inflation and a drag on overall GDP. As oil demand turns lower with overall economic activity, oil prices may well follow—but not in a way likely to satisfy Trump and his constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;does-an-imposed-settlement-in-ukraine-reduce-oil-prices&quot;&gt;Does An Imposed Settlement in Ukraine Reduce Oil Prices?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s stance on Russia has changed dramatically during his first month in office. In his remarks to the Davos audience in January, Trump said of oil prices, “If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately. Right now, the price is high enough that that war will continue.” Trump’s remarks implied that only a substantial reduction in Moscow’s oil revenues would cause Putin sufficient pain to compel him to end the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By February 18, Trump had apparently sided with Putin; immediately after his top advisors met their Russian counterparts in Riyadh, Trump blamed Ukraine for initiating the war and chided Kyiv for not cutting a deal to end it sooner. This new stance seems inconsistent with the previously declared need to reduce oil prices to force an end to the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two policies to watch in reaction to the initiatives to force a Ukraine ceasefire are the ban on Russian oil imports and the cap on Russian oil sales, imposed respectively by the European Union and the G7. Unless an arrangement to end the fighting is endorsed by key European powers, both measures are likely to remain in force and maintain the status quo for Russian oil exports: its crude oil headed only to India and China, significant discounts for Russian oil cargoes, and full employment of the shadow fleet and other instruments used to evade the sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方質疑黎智英文章沒叫人不要觸犯國安法 黎反問：這是我的責任嗎？&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（27日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第140日審訊，黎智英第48日作供。控方繼續盤問，質疑黎在《國安法》生效之後持續呼籲外國制裁。黎確認他沒有被《國安法》嚇怕，「我對《國安法》的嚴重後果有所警覺，但是我不感到害怕。」黎並稱會繼續做任何他要做的事情，說任何他要說的話，但是不會以犯法的方式；但他同時提到《國安法》紅線模糊，沒有清晰的界線，即使他做的事情是合法，也可能有後果。控方一度質疑，黎沒有一篇專欄文章是叫人們不要觸犯《國安法》。黎反問：「要這樣做，是我的責任嗎？我認為所有人都知道不要觸犯《國安法》！我應該跟他們說『不要犯罪！不要犯罪！』嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎主動澄清昨日證供我是香港的中國人&quot;&gt;黎主動澄清昨日證供：我是香港的中國人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;昨日法官杜麗冰指黎是中國人時，他反駁稱自己是香港人。今天甫開庭，黎智英主動表示，要求法庭容許他更正昨日證供，他澄清自己並非內地的中國人（a Mainland Chinese），而是香港的中國人（a Hong Kong Chinese），這與他早前的證供一致，即是：「我愛中國作為我的國家，但不是作為一個政府。（I love China as my country but not as a state.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎從新聞得悉若李文亮事件-控方質疑黎無法知道新聞是否真確&quot;&gt;黎：從新聞得悉若李文亮事件 控方質疑黎無法知道新聞是否真確&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問，在2020年11月29日的網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」中，黎稱新冠病毒之所以擴散至全球，是因為中國沒有言論自由。黎在庭上稱，他有在節目中解釋理由，指若然中國容許言論自由，當醫生李文亮最初發現病毒時，可以在社交媒體通報的話，那麼人們便可以較警覺，政府也可以從病毒源頭控制疫情，而新冠肺炎災難便得以避免。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 副刑事檢控專員 周天行&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎怎樣知道上述事件？黎稱新聞有報導。控方質疑黎無法知道新聞所述是否真確？黎指很多媒體都有報導，他認為這是真確。控方質疑，這是黎的臆測。黎稱這是「具知識基礎的臆測（educated supposition）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎從新聞得悉相關資訊，而未有查核事實，黎純粹依賴傳媒。黎確認，但同時強調傳媒有一套查核事實的制度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎有意著節目言論煽動對中央政府的憎恨。黎回應，他想說的是言論自由對於社會的透明度是非常重要。控方指這只是黎的個人意見。黎反駁這是很多人的意見，包括他本人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎節目稱某些人叫停螞蟻集團上市反映內地人治-控方質疑黎未有查核事實&quot;&gt;黎節目稱「某些人」叫停螞蟻集團上市反映內地「人治」 控方質疑黎未有查核事實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中提及中國內地的螞蟻集團，擬於2020年10月在上海和香港交易所招股上市，但是在兩天之前突然撤回上市計劃。黎稱事件反映內地是「人治」而非「法治」，因為所有事情都應該經過立法和司法程序，然而是次僅因為「某些人（somebody）」叫停，而導致上市最終「剎停」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上稱是從新聞得悉有關事件，控方質疑黎未有自行做事實查核。黎反駁：「如果所有人讀報紙的時候都要查核事實，那麼沒有人會閱讀報紙，因為這樣太花時間了。」控方問黎，是否認為每份報紙都會做事實查核？黎同意，因為每份報紙發表新聞報導之前，都需要從兩個或以上的消息來源核實。控方指這只是黎的猜測。黎繼續反駁：「這是傳媒的守則。」法官杜麗冰指：「但不是所有人都遵守規則。」黎指若然不遵守傳媒守則的話，他們便會犯錯及需要倒閉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又追問，所以黎是不知道叫停上市的「某些人」是誰？黎重申其節目言論來自新聞報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎稱中國當局用科技監控人民屬猜測&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎稱中國當局用科技監控人民屬猜測&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述黎在節目形容前特首林鄭月娥是「魔鬼」。黎確認，並強調：「這是我的意見。」控方指，黎在網上直播節目作出這番公開言論，不是有意圖引起觀眾對特區官員和政府的不滿嗎？黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目形容習近平是史上最強大的獨裁者，比毛澤東更強大，因毛的時代經濟不如現在那般強大，也還未有監控人民的科技。黎庭上指：「這是事實。」，因現時當局可以透過監控系統和人民的 iPhone 等，便可追蹤到人民身處位置及與誰人一起。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑這是黎的猜測？黎說：「這不是猜測，你可以查看中國發生什麼事。」控方問，黎有什麼事實基礎？黎稱新聞報導。控方再度質疑黎未有自行查核有關事實。黎反問他怎樣自行查核事實？控方指黎透過沒有事實根據的批評，意圖挑起人們反政府情緒，以及意圖煽惑讀者的恐懼。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎透過11月29日這一集節目，意圖引起觀眾憎恨政府、激使別人以非法手段改變現有合法制度及慫使他人不守法等。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱批評是要求改善和修正的一種方式&quot;&gt;黎稱批評是要求改善和修正的一種方式&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，黎的節目沒有任何言論是旨在指出政府錯處及不足，以求改善施政。黎稱：「我認為批評是要求改善和修正的一種方式。」控方則反駁，黎的批評是有意煽惑仇恨。黎回應：「批評是為了當局察覺我們的想法，而這對於改革是有需要的。」控方質疑黎僅作出個人陳述，針對林鄭作出攻擊。黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後問到，若然黎的說法是批評政府，為什麼對前特首作出人身攻擊，而不是評論她的施政表現？黎稱：「因為她的表現已反映了她是怎樣的人。（Because her performance came from her, is what she was.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;霍士新聞主持人稱會將黎受訪片段傳送給特朗普&quot;&gt;《霍士新聞》主持人稱會將黎受訪片段傳送給特朗普&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著圍繞黎在《國安法》生效前後，有否持續其行為的議題。有關《國安法》生效之前的時段，控方提及黎於2020年5月26日接受《霍士新聞》訪問時，當節目主持人 Maria Bartiromo 問黎，美國可以怎樣改變中國，黎回答稱美國應該向中國官員實施制裁、凍結銀行帳戶，以及停止向中國輸出技術等。黎確認當時提倡制裁，並強調當時《國安法》並未生效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著出示黎與 Maria Bartiromo 之間的訊息對話，Maria 向黎稱她會將該次訪問片段，傳送給時任美國總統特朗普。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎確認在-twitter-帖文呼籲外國實施更強硬的制裁&quot;&gt;黎確認在 Twitter 帖文呼籲外國實施更強硬的制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方盤問下，黎確認他於2019年6月9日在史丹福大學胡佛學院的公開講座中呼籲外國制裁。控方接著展示2020年6月11日的 Twitter 帖文，當中上載《蘋果》報紙標題「警設國安部門 生效首天即執法」，並稱：「中共似乎減弱了《國安法》。不要被愚弄。這只是停止制裁的暴怒，使他們失去聲勢，以及後來中共再次逼迫我們的時候不能恢復聲勢。中共懼怕制裁，而這是一個好理由去實施更強硬的制裁。」控方問黎是否在帖文中呼籲外國實施更強硬的制裁？黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年6月13日的 Twitter 帖文，當中黎稱線上對話程式 ZOOM 會遵從中國當局要求，將用戶資料交給中國當局，「中共去得太盡（CCP is going too far.）」，美國可以向出賣用戶私隱、與中共有聯繫的企業，以制裁來報復。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指帖文是「徒弟」李兆富所撰寫，但是他會對帖文負責。控方指，帖文提及的事件是發生在美國，與《國安法》沒有任何關係。黎則認為與《國安法》有關係，「《國安法》將來臨，所有人都很緊張，因此在這個壓力底下，李兆富寫了這帖文。」控方追問，帖文談及的事件與《國安法》無關，但是黎依然要求美國去「報復」？黎同意，指李兆富這樣寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指國安法後-黎從沒要求將twitter帖文及外媒訪問下架&quot;&gt;控方指國安法後 黎從沒要求將Twitter帖文及外媒訪問下架&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示多個《國安法》前發布的 Twitter 帖文，黎稱部份帖文非出自他手筆，而是由李兆富撰寫。被問到是否同意帖文內容，黎稱：「我沒有權不同意，因為我需要負責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰則反駁指，「沒有權不同意」的意思是黎對 Twitter 帳戶沒有控制權；「但是你有權，因為這是你的 Twitter 帳戶！」杜官又指黎回覆李兆富的訊息指帖文內容「很棒（Great）」。黎重申：「我沒有權不同意，因為我要同意，因為我要負責任。」杜官批評，合理的人不會理解黎的答案，「這是不合理的！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，直至6月30日，即《國安法》生效之前，黎有呼籲外國針對中國及香港特區實施制裁和敵對行動。黎同意有呼籲制裁，但堅稱沒有呼籲敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，《國安法》生效之後，黎從沒要求將涉及制裁的 Twitter 帖文，從其帳戶下架。黎確認未曾要求下架，但強調該些帖文是《國安法》之前發布，他沒有想過是不合法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎從沒要求外媒將其訪問片段下架，包括《霍士新聞》、《自由亞洲電台》和胡佛學院。黎同樣表示，該些訪問是《國安法》之前進行，他未曾想過是不合法，所以認為沒有需要要求下架。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎受訪稱若擔心便不能做任何事情或講任何說話&quot;&gt;黎受訪稱若擔心便不能做任何事情或講任何說話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在2020年7月1日接受《霍士新聞》訪問，主持人 Maria Bartiromo 問黎智英，《國安法》生效之後會否擔心被捕，黎則表示：「我不擔心，因為我不能擔心，如果我擔心，就不能做任何事情或講任何說話。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，當時黎的意圖是繼續做任何他一直做的事情及說他一直說的話，而無視《國安法》的後果。黎不同意，因為如果是這樣的話，他理應會非常擔心。他又稱，他會合法地繼續做，而不是非法地做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎出示他與 Maria Bartiromo 之間的訊息對話。黎確認他將接受外媒訪問，視為向美國人交流想法及向美國尋求援助的方式。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;美國官員經mark-simon提出要求會見陳日君樞機&quot;&gt;美國官員經Mark Simon提出要求會見陳日君樞機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 於7月2日的訊息，指時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧、其助手 Mary Kissel 及時任美國司法部長觀看了《霍士新聞》的訪問，並且正在留意黎。Mark Simon 亦表示：「他們有一個重要的請求，來自上級，他們想見樞機（陳日君）。他是一個可以影響跨黨派的人物。」，並問黎樞機是否能夠外遊。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 天主教香港教區榮休主教 陳日君樞機&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問這訊息是否另一個例子證明 Mark Simon 向黎傳達美國政府的內部消息？黎則稱這些不是內部消息，而且《霍士新聞》可以公開在網上觀看。法官杜麗冰則指，Mark Simon 轉述美國官員與樞機對話的重要性，不是一種內部消息嗎？黎則堅稱這只是一個經 Mark Simon 作出的請求，不論它重要與否，都是屬於「請求」而非「內部消息」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭則指，Mark Simon 告訴黎，當時至少有三名美國官員觀看過黎的訪問片段。黎同意，但是不代表他們其後有觀看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎文章沒叫人不要觸犯國安法-黎反問這是我的責任嗎&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎文章沒叫人不要觸犯國安法 黎反問：這是我的責任嗎？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年7月5日黎的專欄文章〈飛翔吧 良知的脊樑在撐著〉，當中稱：「有心人說，快點走，勾結外國勢力是叛國罪，可以是槍斃的啊！我說，我不走，煮到來就食，走了我還怎能做人。很久前已決定不讓恐懼震懾我，否則每說一句話，每做一件事都忌諱後果，我還可以說什麼，還可以做啥事，還可以抬起頭做人嗎！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上確認他沒有被《國安法》嚇怕。控方指黎不害怕《國安法》帶來的後果？黎表示：「我對《國安法》的嚴重後果有所警覺，但是我不感到害怕。」控方追問，黎會繼續做一直做的事情？黎回答：「合法地做，但不會以非法的形式繼續。」控方問，如果某人的行為是合法，那麼在《國安法》生效後也不會有後果。黎表示：「這個⋯⋯你永遠不知道。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎的回答是什麼意思。黎解釋，他不會做犯法的事情，但是他會繼續做任何他要做的事情，說任何他要說的話，只要是合法的方式；但是《國安法》的紅線模糊，沒有清晰的界線，即使他做的事情是合法，也可能有後果。控方問黎不是看過《國安法》條文嗎？黎稱這不代表他清楚明白紅線在哪裡，因為它是含糊（opaque）和不清晰。控方指黎無視《國安法》的後果。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，沒有一篇黎撰寫的文章是叫人們不要觸犯《國安法》？黎反問：「要這樣做，是我的責任嗎？我認為所有人都知道不要觸犯《國安法》！我應該跟他們說『不要犯罪！不要犯罪！』嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎不擔心《國安法》，所以會繼續做一直以來做的事情。黎否認這樣說過，反稱他不擔心是因為他所做的事情不會犯法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎節目稱會依然走相同的路-否認不惜觸犯國安法&quot;&gt;黎節目稱會依然走相同的路 否認不惜觸犯國安法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年8月18日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，黎在節目中稱回望過去，「我會依然做相同的事情？我會依然走相同的路嗎？我幾乎立即有頭緒，是的，我會，因為這是我的個性。」控方指，上述言論反映即使會觸犯《國安法》也好，黎都會繼續做他一直以來做的事情。黎不同意，強調這番言論是回望過去，他依然會做相同的事，而非展望未來。黎一度反問控方：「我說回望過去，你理解英文嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s key findings are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As NATO’s European air forces attempt to transition towards a primary focus on the threat from Russia, and the need to have credible capability in that high-threat, high-intensity context, most are likely to struggle to do so without reducing the breadth of mission sets and capability areas that they currently attempt to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast jet pilots must work in an extremely physically and mentally demanding role. Despite the vital role of advanced synthetic training, many European air forces will struggle to afford sufficient live and synthetic flight hours to enable pilots to build and maintain the levels of skill required in a Russia–NATO threat context across the full range of missions possible for modern multi-role fighter aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even where air forces can provide sufficient high-quality training flying, both live and synthetic, to generate pilot mission competencies at the required level across the full multi-role mission set, this is not enough to ensure effectiveness without adequate stockpiles of suitable munitions. In particular, the munitions required to be effective against Russian ground-based air defences and Russian combat aircraft in an air-to-air role are very expensive and would be required in much greater quantities than currently owned by most European air forces in any serious clash with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, to afford a meaningful stockpile of suppression and destruction of enemy air defences, long-range precision strike or long-range air-to-air missiles, most European nations would need to either greatly increase defence spending allocated to combat air, or cut other areas of capability, to afford to specialise in building out munitions stocks required for one or more specific mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The political and geographical location of different countries, as well as the type of combat aircraft currently operated or on order, will affect the potential mission areas in which any given country could credibly and relatively quickly build up seriously high-intensity readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countries can only take risk against some mission areas in order to specialise in being really good at others if this approach is pursued in close coordination with trusted allies who are doing the same in a complementary way, to ensure that, as European air forces, all the required mission areas are well covered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the current approach of most states attempting to field small multirole fighter fleets that has preserved apparent sovereign freedom of choice in the relatively permissive or semi-permissive operations since the end of the Cold War may not be practical as a deterrent to Russia. Meeting the cost of ensuring that pilots are sufficiently well trained to survive and be effective against the high-end ground-based and airborne threats that they would face, and that they have adequate stockpiles of suitable munitions, decoys and other enablers, is likely to only be possible for most European air forces if they focus such efforts on a few mission sets each. The only viable alternative would seem to be a huge increase in funding to fill in the gaps across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional assumptions about the direct threat Russian forces could pose to NATO countries in the coming years need to be urgently revised following the failure of the Ukrainian summer offensive in 2023 and Russia’s unfortunately successful pivot to a long war strategy throughout 2024. After a low point in early 2023, Russian industry has significantly increased production output of weapons and ammunition of almost all kinds. This trend is likely to accelerate, as the Russian parliament approved a 68% increase in defence spending in the state plans for the 2024/25 financial year compared with 2023/24. The increase will take Russian military spending to over 6% of GDP and cement a structural economic bias towards long-term conflict, as well as the industrial output to support such a posture. Depleted European stocks of heavy equipment and ammunition – due to donations to Ukraine not having been replaced promptly in many cases – are exacerbating the worsening battlefield situation in Ukraine and the risks posed by the reconstitution of Russian conventional military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dependence-on-the-us&quot;&gt;Dependence on the US&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, conventional deterrence in Europe of any potential Russian threat to NATO has been essentially assured by the overwhelming power of the US military. Unfortunately, the growth of Chinese capabilities is forcing the US to reallocate ever more of its military capacity to the Indo-Pacific at the expense of other theatres. Many in the Pentagon assess that the period of greatest risk of the Chinese military attempting to blockade or invade Taiwan (sometimes known as the “Davidson Window”) is 2026–28. In the event of a dangerous stand-off or a military conflict in the Indo-Pacific during the coming decade, it is likely that a high proportion of American fifth-generation fighters, electronic attack aircraft, long-range stand-off weapons, air and missile defence systems, and tankers deployed in European Command and Central Command would be transferred to Indo-Pacific Command. This would greatly reduce NATO combat power in Europe. The demands of such a conflict would also limit US capacity to provide rapid large-scale resupply of long-range munitions and spare parts to European militaries in the event of a concurrent Russian attack on NATO territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who argue that the military threat from either China in the Indo-Pacific or from Russia in Europe should be prioritised as the more likely miss a fundamental point. China has a strong interest in supporting Russia to ensure it remains a serious military threat in Europe, as that will split NATO attention and resources. More importantly, in the event of a serious stand-off or actual conflict with China that leaves US forces largely fixed in the Indo-Pacific in the mid-to-late 2020s, Russia will have a strong incentive to take a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to break NATO by testing Article 5 while the US is unable to reinforce NATO effectively. Another factor that must be considered is the risk that President Donald Trump follows through with his repeated threats to either officially or de facto remove US defence guarantees to other NATO nations if transatlantic relations sour during his second term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent a future war with Russia, NATO’s European member states must be capable of largely shouldering the task of deterring Russian military aggression. Historically, states do not start premeditated wars that they perceive as likely to be long, costly and with an uncertain outcome; the opportunistic and cynical nature of aggression under President Vladimir Putin suggests Russia is no exception. However, once at war, Russia has repeatedly shown an unmatched capacity to absorb catastrophic casualties and setbacks without backing down. Deterrence, therefore, requires a demonstrable capability to rapidly defeat any opportunistic aggression by Russia, thus denying the Kremlin any perceived opportunity for an “easy win” that could discredit Article 5 and NATO’s collective defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-vital-role-of-air-superiority&quot;&gt;The Vital Role of Air Superiority&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air superiority is a necessity if European states are to rapidly demonstrate the capability to quickly repulse Russian conventional aggression. Without air superiority, NATO’s European powers lack the recruitment capacity, munitions manufacturing capacity and defence funding to field the scale and quality of high-readiness ground forces and land-based firepower needed to rapidly and definitively repulse a determined Russian attack. Land power is vital, of course, and heavy manoeuvre forces – such as those being built up by Poland, Finland and Germany – are essential to deterrence. However, such forces are still dependent on the ISTAR overwatch and massive firepower that air superiority enables for sustainable effectiveness against larger, battle-hardened Russian forces which possess far more ground-based firepower. This is especially the case for forward-deployed forces since, as the potential aggressor, Russia can mass forces at a point and time of its choosing, whereas NATO has committed to defending “every inch of Alliance territory”. Thus, to avoid being left seriously vulnerable when or if US rapid reinforcement is unlikely, European air forces must be able to achieve and exploit air superiority in a contested area. This requires the capacity to locate, suppress and then destroy the Russian surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems that currently would make air superiority over contested Alliance territory impossible to achieve without a major US suppression and destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) campaign, while also keeping the fighters and long-range missile-carrying bombers of the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, few European air forces have the stockpiles of specialised weapons needed, nor dedicate the focused aircrew training time required, to field high-end SEAD/DEAD capabilities. As a result, NATO’s practical SEAD/DEAD capabilities against Russia in a direct conflict are heavily dependent on the US Air Force and the US Navy’s Carrier Air Wings. While SEAD/DEAD is perhaps the most glaring area of Europe’s dependence, there are other critical mission sets – such as airborne electronic warfare (EW) and penetrating ISTAR – that are also almost exclusively provided by the US. The primary reason for this is that most other NATO air forces spread their limited budgets thinly by trying to maintain and modernise a range of different multi-role fighters, helicopter fleets and relatively small quantities of enablers such as aerial refuelling tankers. Even for those states that successfully cover these “basics”, there is precious little money and usually too few personnel to allocate to comparatively specialised capabilities such as electronic attack (EA) or penetrating ISTAR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;greater-specialisation-needed&quot;&gt;Greater Specialisation Needed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change this situation quickly, European air forces should explore specialisation along national lines within the Alliance – accepting risk against some mission sets/capabilities in order to free up the required funding, personnel and enabling capabilities that will allow other mission sets to be enacted more credibly. This paper aims to explain why such specialisation is necessary and to suggest areas where collective, coordinated mission specialisation could enable a rapid improvement in the combat capability of European NATO air forces, thus helping to deter future Russian aggression. The paper does this by examining two primary areas, divided over two chapters: Chapter I looks at fast jet pilot training and currency requirements for high-intensity conflict scenarios; and Chapter II examines the requirements and costs for suitable munitions across key mission sets. The paper concludes with some recommendations, including several examples of potential specialisation choices that might be made, given: (i) the resource and force structure outlook for certain states’ air forces; and (ii) the differing political conditions often attached to the use of kinetic force for some Allied nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper draws heavily on interviews with instructor pilots and unit leaders conducted during research visits by the author to frontline fighter units across multiple NATO air forces throughout 2023 and 2024, often including backseat observation during numerous live training sorties. This research included frontline visits with the RAF, the French Air Force, the US Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Italian Air Force, the German Air Force, the Royal Netherlands Air Force, the Swedish Air Force and the Finnish Air Force. The paper was also informed by observations and interviews with senior leaders and instructors accrued during multinational training and exercises at the NATO Tactical Leadership Programme in Albacete, Spain, and at NATO Air Command in Ramstein, Germany. It also builds directly on similar research conducted throughout 2022, which examined the gaps in NATO air force capabilities exposed by the return of overt Russian military aggression to the European security landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-pilot-proficiency&quot;&gt;I. Pilot Proficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating and maintaining a truly combat-ready force of multi-role fast jet aircrew is one of the most difficult and expensive tasks that Western militaries regularly undertake. A frequent misperception among non-specialists is that the difficult challenge is training pilots to fly fast jets. It is true that it takes anywhere from three to seven years and millions of pounds/dollars to train a pilot to fly a succession of faster, heavier and more complex aircraft to the standard required to join a frontline fast jet squadron, but this is actually only the beginning of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When aircrew complete their conversion onto a type of fast jet, they are qualified to fly the aircraft in question – such as an F-16, Typhoon or F-35 – and will have been taught how to operate the sensors, subsystems and weapons, as well as learning basic tactics, in the operational conversion unit, before graduating to the frontline. At this stage of their careers they will already have attained several hundred flying hours and around 80–100 hours of live and simulated flying on the frontline type onto which they are converting. According to recent figures released by the UK’s minister of state for the armed forces, the cost of training a British pilot to this stage is approximately £5.4 million. Despite this, in the fast jet world such pilots are still generally not considered to be ready to go into combat: additional mission-specific tactical and procedural training and testing by the instructor pilots on their frontline squadron are needed before they can be certified as “combat-ready” for simple mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the RAF, as with many other Western air forces, the first mission that most junior pilots are qualified to fly when they are certified as combat ready is quick reaction alert (QRA). QRA is essentially basic air defence and peacetime air policing, where pairs of armed fighters are maintained at a few minutes’ notice, 24/7, to scramble to intercept, identify, assist or even (if necessary) shoot down unidentified or unresponsive civilian or military aircraft inside or close to national airspace. The mission carries huge responsibility and requires pilots to be on duty for 24 hours at a time, ready to scramble without knowing, initially, the situation they will face. However, in terms of tactical complexity it is relatively simple, since in most QRA scenarios there is no ground-based threat and the assumption is that even if the aircraft is from a hostile state such as Russia, the encounter will not involve weapons release – although, of course, the aircraft are armed, and the risk is always there. Despite the relative simplicity of QRA sorties, the workload and the demands placed on pilots during them can be intense. As such, newly combat-ready pilots with perhaps 100 hours of fast jet flying time and a year on a frontline squadron will remain junior “wingmen” – meaning that in the air they follow and provide support/backup for a more experienced formation leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different air forces have different approaches to how quickly pilots can progress through various qualifications and which mission sets are prioritised. For example, in the RAF or the US Air Force, new pilots are typically combat ready within six to eight months of joining a frontline squadron, and usually progress to their two-ship lead qualifications in the second year. Exceptional pilots might be judged ready to undertake the qualification to lead the basic formation for more advanced tactics, which is four fighters – known as a four-ship – by the end of their first three-year frontline tour. Most others will achieve their four-ship lead qualification midway through their second frontline tour of three years. Particularly tactically competent pilots might then be judged suitable as candidates to attempt the extremely demanding RAF Qualified Weapons Instructor or American Fighter Weapons Instructor courses after a single frontline tour (although two tours is preferred due to the pass rate on the course generally being higher for candidates who have more experience). By contrast, progress is slower in the Swedish Air Force or the Finnish Air Force, where a dispersed operating model and requirement to fly missions regularly against peer (Russian) air threats at low altitudes in bad weather and at night as standard equates to higher complexity. Pilots are likely to be combat ready around a year after joining the frontline, but are generally not considered for two-ship lead upgrade until at least three years on squadron; four-ship lead qualifications usually come after a minimum of about six years. Swedish or Finnish pilots will have typically served about 10 years on a frontline squadron before some are considered suitable candidates for weapons instructor/mission commander training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These total training times should be understood in a context where the traditional minimum NATO standard required for fast jet aircrew in terms of annual flying hours is 180, of which 40 can be in a full mission simulator. However, different air forces’ pilots accrue different flying hour totals depending on financial position, simulator capabilities and cultural attitudes; and 120–40 live flying hours a year is now fairly common across Europe. With costs per flying hour for most fast jets sitting in the range of tens of thousands of pounds/dollars, it is not hard to see why training proficient combat-ready fast jet aircrew is extremely expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;physical-demands-on-pilots&quot;&gt;Physical Demands on Pilots&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of pilot training hours can seem strange to the non-specialist, given the sophistication of modern fly-by-wire flight controls and consequently how comparatively easy modern fighter aircraft are to fly from a “stick and rudder” point of view. It becomes more logical, however, once it is understood that a fast jet cockpit is a physically demanding environment to work in, and quite how many things fast jet pilots must be able to do simultaneously in order to perform their missions safely and effectively. Pilots work strapped into rocket-powered ejection seats under a canopy (which acts as a “greenhouse” in hot weather) in seating positions that often rapidly become uncomfortable during longer sorties; pilots also have to wear many layers of uncomfortable protective equipment, which can rapidly cause their bodies to overheat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During flight, pilots are subjected to constant noise and vibration, as well as rapid pressure changes due to varying altitude, and they must deal with the rapid onset of often sustained g-forces whenever the aircraft is being manoeuvred at high speeds. The g-forces in particular place huge strain on the body, especially during basic fighter manoeuvres (BFM) – otherwise known as dogfighting – or when “cranking”, which involves turning hard and sometimes diving to evade incoming missile threats. Under high-g forces of 7–9 g, internal organs are displaced by several inches, and pilots must constantly strain their core and leg muscles and force themselves to pressure-breathe to keep enough blood in their head to avoid loss of vision and consciousness. Staying conscious under high-g is hard work and physically painful for passengers, or in a centrifuge for training, but fast jet pilots must continue to work through it. This means monitoring their radar and EW systems, and maintaining situational awareness through the sensors in the cockpit, constantly mentally assessing their own and adversaries’ weapons ranges and kill probability as each aircraft manoeuvres, and craning their necks to look behind and above to keep visual tally on the enemy and other members of their own formation. All the while, they must make split-second tactical decisions, and constantly communicate with other members of the formation and air battle managers on the ground or in allied AWACS aircraft to maintain deconfliction and tactical effectiveness. For those not regularly acclimatised to such extreme conditions, the overwhelming physical sensations and information overload are also often accompanied by rapid spatial disorientation and severe airsickness. This is one of the reasons why pilots – especially in the first few years of their frontline careers – need to fly at least two to three hours per week to stay physically acclimatised, and be able to work efficiently and constantly learn additional skills despite the intense physical and mental demands of the fast jet cockpit environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increasing-mission-complexity&quot;&gt;Increasing Mission Complexity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When dealing with mission sets beyond BFM and QRA, things become increasingly complex. For example, relatively basic beyond visual range (BVR) tactics involve four-ship formations operating together as a group. This allows them to efficiently allocate radar scan areas and settings to search for (and target) multiple incoming enemy aircraft across a large vertical and horizontal area. It also allows mutual defensive support, and presents opponents with multiple concurrent missile threats as the distance between opposing formations narrows, which hopefully keeps them flying defensively and thus unable to gain a positional or energy advantage. However, employing such tactics requires experienced pilots who can lead a formation of four aircraft, keep track of what all of them are doing in real time, and coordinate them while manoeuvring hard and managing their own radar, weapons and deconfliction. Such four-ship lead pilots must also be familiar enough with such tactics to plan, brief and debrief each mission thoroughly so that all involved learn lessons from it. This involves providing detailed critical feedback and corrective guidance on every manoeuvre, every missile shot, and every decision taken by friendly and enemy aircraft in a flight – which for complex missions can take many hours. The tactical complexity, weapon and fuel management, deconfliction and communication requirements placed on pilots increases even further for missions such as those that might be required against Russian forces, which would involve not only a hostile air element but also ground-based SAM threats and/or ground targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way that even carefully selected human beings can reach the level of capability required to be effective operators of fast jets in a complex combat environment is by gradually building up currency in myriad component skill sets involved in operating such aircraft, to the point that each task requires very little conscious mental effort or capacity. At each stage where sufficient familiarity has been reached in one set of skills, mental capacity is freed up, enabling pilots to learn to perform additional mission-specific tasks and ultimately also to undertake tactical leadership functions in the air. However, this means that mission currency is critical. If pilots are not able to fly multiple times per week – both for real and in the simulator – they will rapidly start to lose familiarity with key procedures and skill sets for certain missions. The less that pilots fly, the less mental capacity they have for tactical decision-making when flying, because they are no longer able to do the huge number of more basic tasks smoothly without conscious thought while under heavy physical stress. Consequently, the more mission sets that a given fighter force is liable to perform and thus compelled to train for, the more flying hours it will need to be funded for, so that its pilots can gain and then maintain the requisite skills and ability to perform those mission sets under pressure, while managing all the other tasks that must be constantly undertaken in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Trade-Offs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many NATO air forces fly multi-role fighter aircraft, but currently do not fund sufficient core flying training hours for their aircrew to allow them to maintain high-level proficiency beyond the most common mission sets – meaning that they do not necessarily have truly multi-role capability at any given point in time. During the past 20 years, this has not necessarily been a major problem. Most multi-role fighter pilots who were deployed to perform complex close air support (CAS) and/or battlefield interdiction tasks during counterinsurgency or overseas intervention operations had the luxury of a “work up” training period prior to their deployment. Because campaigns such as Iraq (from 2003) and Afghanistan (from 2006) were enduring operations, fighter units were deployed on rotation from across many air forces, and before each rotation into theatre, pilots would generally undertake anything from several weeks to several months of intensive and focused pre-deployment training to make sure that their CAS skills and other interoperability requirements – such as multi-type tanker qualifications – were fully current. In the current context, however, the skills needed to be effective and survivable when operating as part of NATO’s Regional Defence Plans, including complex mission planning and mutually supportive multinational four-ship tactics in offensive counter-air (OCA), SEAD/DEAD and contested CAS, need to be ready in a crisis, without long work-up times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, where funding for core flying training hours is a major constraint, it may be more effective for air forces to purchase light fighter types such as the Gripen or the newest variants of F-16, which lack some of the top-end capabilities of more expensive types such as the F-35, Typhoon or Rafale. Fighters that are cheap and efficient to maintain and operate can be flown much more for a given flying training budget and so can often enable pilots from cash-constrained air forces to achieve higher levels of mission proficiency and thus capability – at least in non-penetrating mission sets such as defensive counter-air (DCA) – than if they were flying more expensive jets that they could not train with very often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it is a false economy for countries that operate more expensive heavy or stealth fighter types to try to save money by not funding enough flying hours to hit the NATO requirement. Doing so means that aircrew may struggle to be genuinely capable across the multiple high-threat mission sets that those aircraft were designed to be capable of performing in high-threat scenarios. This is especially problematic in air forces such as the RAF that heavily task their fast jet fleets with conducting relatively small-scale operational and exercise deployments all over the world. If operational flying hours – many of which are spent in long transits or on combat air patrol (CAP) with little training value – are substituted for core flying hours, then key skills and currencies for high-intensity mission sets will quickly begin to atrophy across the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where it is not possible to fund additional core flying training hours to allow pilots to genuinely gain and retain high levels of currency across multiple complex mission sets beyond “basic” QRA, permissive CAS and air-to-air proficiencies, the logical alternative is to reduce the number of mission sets that aircrew train to fulfil. This can be done either by assigning individual squadrons specific mission sets on which to focus a greater proportion of their training time and hold primary liability for; or, at a national level, by deprioritising certain mission areas (to which other Allies are better suited) in order to concentrate training resources on making sure that some mission sets are deliverable to a very high standard as a specialised national contribution within NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although specialisation in medium and small air forces would reduce overall sovereign “choice” in which mission sets to tackle in any given campaign (and has been avoided by most air forces during the post-Cold War decades as a result), the alternative multi-role approach entails a loss of high-end skills. This was generally judged to be acceptable when most operations were expected to be relatively permissive counterinsurgency and intervention campaigns in which massive US military support led the way. However, the costs of trying to maintain a full spectrum of multi-role proficiencies with limited core training hours and regular deployments is much more problematic when facing the threat systems that Russian forces deploy, and is likely to lead to serious losses in an actual conflict. Where nations have retained either a primary focus on deterring Russia or where a mission set has been maintained that inherently focuses on high-threat scenarios such as SEAD, unit-level specialisation already exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Swedish Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Sweden, for example, despite relatively healthy live flying hours of around 120–60 hours per year, each of the country’s three fighter wings has a different multi-role training focus. Every Swedish fighter pilot flying the Gripen C/D first learns to be combat ready in the BVR air-to-air tactics that would be used in the event of a major war with Russia, and all maintain both BVR and BFM tactical proficiency throughout their careers. Then, depending on which fighter wing they are stationed at, pilots will spend most of the remainder of their flying hours training for a specific secondary mission set. F 21 Wing at Luleå specialises in CAS, while F 17 Wing at Ronneby specialises in anti-surface warfare (ASuW) and maritime tactical reconnaissance in cooperation with the Swedish Navy; F 7 Wing at Såtenäs, meanwhile, specialises in producing instructor pilots responsible for converting new pilots onto the Gripen C/D, and also maintains ASuW proficiency. This approach means that even with flying hour totals that are lower than some other NATO air forces, and given somewhat limited use of simulator resources for tactical training, the Swedish Air Force in aggregate is still able to generate and sustain high levels of pilot proficiency across all its core mission sets. At the national level, the Swedish Air Force has – unlike all other European air forces – maintained a very credible ASuW capability. However, currently, Sweden has little in the way of credible SEAD/DEAD or penetrating ISTAR capabilities. It is a prime example of the benefits in terms of credible high-intensity capabilities that can be maintained by medium-sized air forces that choose to specialise in mission sets both at the unit level and the national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other European Approaches to Specialisation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other European examples, such as the almost exclusive training focus on the SEAD mission by the Tornado ECR crews within the Luftwaffe’s Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 51 and the Italian Air Force’s 155° Gruppo. These units will soon be converted – to the Eurofighter EK variant in Germany and the F-35A in the case of the Italian Air Force – but should retain their focus on the SEAD mission when fully re-equipped. While the Tornado ECR is outdated as a platform, the mission training focus of the units which fly it means that the relevant aircrew possess rare skills among NATO peers, as they are able to specialise in understanding Russian threat systems and the integration tactics required to perform SEAD against them in a supportive role within composite air operations (COMAOs). Even with comparatively high numbers of available flying training hours, the US Air Force in Europe takes a similar approach. Each of the F-16 units based in the theatre maintains multi-role proficiencies, but has a specialist area of expertise to which they devote a greater proportion of their flying training time, and for which they are specifically equipped. For the 52nd Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem that specialist mission set is SEAD, while for the 31st Fighter Wing at Aviano it is CAS. When called to operations at short notice, both units consistently perform better in these two roles than other units that maintain a less focused multi-role training syllabus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-the-specialist-approach&quot;&gt;Expanding the Specialist Approach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a strong case for other NATO countries in Europe to explore a similar approach, through specialisation at either the fighter wing/squadron level or the national level. Modern air combat between states is highly punishing for “spirited amateurs”. The lethality of modern threat systems and the tactical complexity involved in executing effective COMAOs against Russian ground-based and aerial threats mean that genuine combat readiness and credibility require intensive training for key mission sets such as SEAD/DEAD and OCA. Consequently, NATO aircrew will have to either fly significantly more training hours (both live and synthetic), or better focus the hours they have by specialising in fewer mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As will be explained in the next chapter, the case for specialisation is strengthened when one examines munitions requirements for the various mission sets involved in establishing air superiority against Russian forces. After all, even the best trained pilot is of little utility in a high-end conflict if their air force does not have access to a ready stockpile of suitable munitions for the mission sets for which they are to be employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-munitions&quot;&gt;II. Munitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other aspects of Western military capability, the munitions stocks held by most NATO air forces have been significantly distorted by the specific requirements of decades of expeditionary counterinsurgency and stabilisation operations. These were typically long campaigns against irregular forces that lacked any serious surface-to-air threat or air force, and where ground force numbers were limited by political considerations, making them heavily reliant on CAS to enable them to defend themselves while spread thinly over large areas. Consequently, during the 2000s and early 2010s, most NATO air forces pursued munitions strategies that prioritised the acquisition of bombs and short-range missiles with high accuracy and limited explosive power (to minimise collateral damage), which were also affordable enough to use on a sustained basis during long campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these are generally not the kind of weapons that are needed to roll back Russia’s ground-based air defences and conduct OCA and DCA at large scale in a high-intensity defensive NATO context. Ordering and increasing stockpiles of more suitable munitions is, therefore, essential and urgent – but this will inevitably be expensive, making it an additional argument for national specialisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-european-air-launched-munitions-types&quot;&gt;Current European Air-Launched Munitions Types&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent times, the RAF, for example, has standardised air-to-ground armament for fast jets around the Paveway IV dual-mode laser and GPS/INS-guided bomb and the Brimstone anti-armour/low collateral missile. This consolidation around only a few munition types enabled these sophisticated weapons to be procured at significant scale from high-efficiency production lines that operated continuously (but at relatively low output volumes) over the past decade. The development of long-range stand-off weapons during much of the post-Cold War period, meanwhile, was limited to obsolescence-mitigation upgrades for the Storm Shadow cruise missile that was developed in the mid-1990s, and procurement volumes were low. Likewise, procurement volumes of the advanced ramjet-powered European Meteor missile for BVR air-to-air combat and the US-made AIM-120C/D AMRAAM (advanced medium-range air-to-air missile) were very low by Cold War standards, since there was perceived to be a very limited air-to-air threat. Cluster bombs and the WE.177 air-delivered tactical nuclear bomb were retired in the 1990s, and the ALARM anti-radiation missile for SEAD was retired from service, without replacement, in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consolidation of the RAF air-to-surface arsenal was arguably a justifiable response to the operational pressures of Iraq, Afghanistan and latterly Libya and Operation Shader. However, the consequence today is that the RAF has no air-delivered weapons suitable for SEAD/DEAD and only a limited remaining inventory of Storm Shadow cruise missiles capable of deep strikes against fixed targets such as bunkers. In contrast to almost any other country with operational F-35 squadrons, the UK’s F-35B fleet is currently only equipped with free-fall Paveway IVs for strikes against ground targets – an almost comically inadequate weapon for any seriously contested airspace, let alone for use inside a Russian integrated air defence system (IADS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the same period as the RAF developments outlined above, France developed its own range of AASM “Hammer” (Armement Air-Sol Modulaire, or Modular Air-to-Ground Armament) bombs to provide the primary air-to-ground armament for its Mirage 2000D and Rafale fleets. The AASM can be used with 250-lb, 500-lb, 1,000-lb and 2,000-lb explosive sections and incorporates laser and GPS guidance, with the additional option of imaging seeker heads for automatic terminal guidance against fixed targets. The AASM can also be fitted with a rocket booster section and pop-out glide wings to significantly extend its stand-off range in contested areas, especially when employed from low altitudes with a pop-up manoeuvre. Consequently, the AASM series is significantly more usable in contested airspace than most NATO bomb families or short-range missile types, thanks to greater stand-off range and terminal accuracy in GPS-denied environments. They have already proven useful in Ukraine when fired from the Ukraine Air Force’s Mig-29 and Su-27 fighters in pop-up lofting profiles after a low-level ingress to minimise risks from Russian SAM systems. Excellent integration with the air-to-ground radar and other systems on the Rafale means that this munition would be significantly more effective still in either French or Greek service. However, the trade-off is a higher unit cost than other utility weapons such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) or Paveway II/IV families that form the primary air-to-surface armament across European NATO air forces. The AASM is also still not particularly suited for use as a dedicated SEAD/DEAD munition, since it lacks the range to engage long-range Russian systems inside a layered IADS, and is not designed to engage highly mobile targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most other European air forces rely on US-made JDAM GPS-guided and Paveway series laser and GPS-guided bombs for their air-to-surface weaponry. More recently, a significant number, including the Royal Netherlands Air Force, the Swedish Air Force and the Italian Air Force, have also acquired the 250-lb GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) to provide a low-cost stand-off capability. However, as a glide bomb, the SDB is slow and highly susceptible to being intercepted by ground-based air defence systems, and it is also reliant on GPS, which means that its terminal accuracy can be degraded by Russian EW systems and it also cannot hit moving targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One weapon that is significantly more suitable for a high-intensity conflict in a NATO context is the AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM). Italy has acquired the AARGM for its ageing Tornado ECR SEAD fleet, and the missile has been ordered by Germany for its upcoming Eurofighter EK derivative that will replace the ECR in Luftwaffe service. It offers significantly greater range and terminal accuracy than the older AGM-88B HARM (High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile), and also functions as a highly effective airborne electromagnetic intelligence (ELINT) sensor when carried. However, the weapon’s fairly large radar cross-section makes it unlikely to have significantly greater survivability against Russian long-range SAMs and their accompanying short-range air defence (SHORAD) systems than the older AGM-88 HARM family that has been regularly intercepted in Ukraine for around 18 months. Thus, while the baseline AARGM – when used by Tornado ECR or future Eurofighter EK – can provide a very useful suppressive effect that can bolster the effectiveness of a broader COMAO (much like the HARM in previous decades), it is not an ideal primary weapon for destroying SAM threats directly. The Tornado ECR itself is rapidly reaching the end of its operational life and was never designed to face modern layered Russian air defences. The AGM-88E is not currently used by other non-US NATO air forces and, since it does not fit inside the weapons bays of the F-35, it has not been integrated with that aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;munitions-requirements-for-seaddead-campaigns&quot;&gt;Munitions Requirements for SEAD/DEAD Campaigns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate truth is that almost all NATO air forces other than the US’s currently lack stockpiles of munitions suitable for a serious SEAD/DEAD campaign. Such weapons need to combine several properties if they are to be effective. First, the weapon must have sufficient stand-off range to be launched from beyond the range at which a hostile IADS can reliably engage the launch aircraft. That stand-off range will obviously vary depending on the penetrating capabilities of the launch aircraft itself, since stealth aircraft can get closer to a given threat than conventional equivalents, for a given level of risk. Second, the weapon must be able to navigate automatically to the rough position of a target SAM or radar system with the aid of an anti-radiation seeker or a GPS-denial-resistant navigation suite that uses coordinates obtained in close to real time, either from the launch aircraft or from other assets that can pass data to the weapon before launch or in-flight. Third, the weapon must be able to actively detect, identify and conduct terminal homing against the target SAM system or radar even once the latter has ceased emitting radar energy and is moving to avoid the incoming missile. Finally, it must be able to reliably penetrate the self-defence capabilities of Russian SAM and SHORAD systems such as the SA-15 Tor and the SA-22 Pantsir; either by being cheap enough to use in large numbers – simultaneously and on a sustainable basis – or by being manoeuvrable, stealthy or fast enough in terminal phases of flight to be hard to shoot down. These requirements are very different from the characteristics of the utility weapons that most NATO air forces are equipped with after decades of counterinsurgency focus, and there are only a few currently available options that can meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candidate Munitions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first weapon that could meet these needs is the significantly more capable and stealthier extended-range variant of the AARGM – the AARGM-ER. In Europe, the AARGM-ER has so far been ordered by Finland, Poland and the Netherlands for use with their F-35A fleets, with likely delivery timeframes commencing in the mid-to-late 2020s. A rough comparison of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notices related to 265 missiles for the Netherlands (for $700 million) and 360 missiles for Poland (for $1.275 billion) suggests a unit cost of between $2.64 million and $3.54 million per missile. Training, mission planning tools and other non-recurring costs will also have been included in the DSCA figures, however, so the cost of each missile is probably closer to $2.53 million–$3 million. An even more advanced derivative of the AARGM-ER is also in development, called the Stand-in Attack Weapon, although initially this will be for US Air Force F-35As only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second option for a suitable SEAD/DEAD munition is the UK-developed SPEAR miniature cruise missile, a 250-lb-class turbojet-powered weapon designed for a stand-off range of more than 140 km and featuring a millimetric radar seeker to allow autonomous terminal homing against SAMs and other mobile targets within a target area. Up to eight will fit inside the weapons bays of a single F-35 and the weapon is designed specifically to work with that aircraft’s advanced threat detection, geolocation and targeting capabilities. SPEAR can also be carried on triple launchers by Typhoon, and could provide a useful stand-off SEAD/DEAD effector to support F-35s further forward in an IADS if the weapon were fully integrated and purchased in significant quantities. However, while SPEAR has been in development since 2010 for use with the F-35B, technical challenges and funding limitations have caused serious delays. These delays, coupled with the Ministry of Defence’s limited order size for production weapons, mean that the cost per weapon is high, and initial operational capability on the F-35B may not be achieved until 2028. The US Joint Programme Office has instead given integration priority within the F-35’s flight test and software upgrade schedule to other US and Allied weapons that have been ordered in greater numbers by more countries – such as the AARGM-ER and the Norwegian Joint Strike Missile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Joint Strike Missile, known as the AGM-184A Kraken in US service, represents another potentially useful option for SEAD/DEAD munitions. This subsonic air-launched cruise missile can be carried either externally or internally in the F-35A. According to US Department of Defense budget documents, the weapon features an imaging infra-red seeker for terminal guidance and has a combined GPS, inertial and terrain reference navigation system that allows it to be effective in “GPS-denied environments”, with stealth properties that confer survivability “against advanced threat systems”. However, like the much faster but probably shorter-ranged AARGM-ER, the Joint Strike Missile costs about $3 million per missile (using the US order of 268 missiles, for $848 million, as a guide).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cost-implications-and-trade-offs&quot;&gt;Cost Implications and Trade-Offs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should be clear at this stage is that dedicated SEAD/DEAD munitions that are capable of reliably penetrating the defences around key Russian SAM systems to start dismantling the ground-based IADS are very expensive, specialised weapons. There are also only a fairly small number of potentially suitable existing weapons that meet the requirements. It is encouraging to see Norway, the Netherlands, Poland and Finland investing in Joint Strike Missile and AARGM-ER at a reasonable scale. Italy has also brought the AARGM into service with the Tornado ECR to replace HARM, and with a planned order for AARGM-ER to equip its F-35As, these are causes for celebration. However, for all these countries, the quantities purchased so far would still run out fairly quickly in a major campaign, and delivery timeframes remain a concern. There is potential for the UK to significantly improve its own capabilities in this area with a large joint order of SPEAR and its stand-in EA variant, the SPEAR-EW. To continue – and ideally rapidly expand – these European SEAD/DEAD munitions purchasing efforts, it will probably be necessary for several of these states to forgo building up significant stockpile levels of other types of munitions. The unit costs of AARGM-ER, SPEAR or Joint Strike Missile are many times higher than those of the sort of direct attack munitions that all NATO air forces have become accustomed to fighting with since the end of the Cold War. It therefore stands to reason that countries that purchase serious stockpiles of SEAD/DEAD munitions will have far less money available for CAS, ASuW and air-to-air weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to increase stockpiles and the opportunity costs of doing so for SEAD/DEAD munitions also hold true, at least to a certain degree, for air-to-air missiles. European NATO air forces have faced little serious prospect of large-scale air-to-air combat since 1991. Consequently, stockpiles of AIM-120 AMRAAM medium-range radar-guided missiles, the very long-range Meteor missile and short-range missiles such as the AIM-132 ASRAAM, AIM-9X and AIM-2000 IRIS-T are far smaller than stocks of comparable missile classes were during the Cold War, across most air forces. The provision of some of these missiles to Ukraine for use as ground-based air defence interceptors in NASAMS, IRIS-T surface launch standard and surface launched missile and other improvised SAM systems has further eroded stockpiles. However, in any conflict with Russia, units tasked with conducting DCA or OCA would need to expend significant numbers of such weapons over a sustained period. Pilots engaging Russian aircraft would be doing so within the constraints imposed by the ground-based IADS threat, probably requiring a high proportion of BVR engagements. When fighting Russian aircraft equipped with modern radars and long-range missiles such as the R-37M (AA-13), BVR tactics would be likely to rely on significant numbers of low probability-of-kill shots with AMRAAM and Meteor to force hostile pilots to “go defensive” early (thus gaining control of engagements). Such tactics would inherently involve expending multiple weapons per target destroyed in many situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCA missions to intercept salvoes of cruise missiles and Shahed-136/Geran-2 one-way attack drones would also consume large volumes of short-range missiles. This was vividly demonstrated during the DCA missions flown successfully by Israeli, American, British and French fighter aircraft against the Iranian attack on Israel on 13 April 2024. Such DCA interceptions are nevertheless an essential component of any strategy to enable the UK – and NATO more broadly – to rapidly improve integrated air and missile defence coverage in Europe, alongside ground-based SAM systems. Consequently, fielding robust capability across the DCA or OCA mission sets during a conflict of any meaningful duration will require having not only aircrew with sufficient proficiency and currency for the tasks against realistic Russian threats, as well as suitable aircraft, but also a significantly greater inventory of air-to-air missiles than most European air forces currently possess. In the absence of significant increases in overall air force funding, procuring such missiles in sufficient quantities is likely to require most European nations to forgo purchasing other classes of munitions – in other words, de facto mission specialisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gps-dependence&quot;&gt;GPS Dependence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the need to rapidly expand dedicated SEAD/DEAD, stand-off precision strike and air-to-air munitions stocks, another problem facing NATO air forces is the heavy reliance on GPS guidance for many counterinsurgency-era weapons systems. Russian forces have routinely used a wide range of tactical-, operational- and strategic-level GPS denial and/or spoofing systems during the war against Ukraine, as well as periodically demonstrating the ability to disrupt GPS at significant distances during NATO exercises and via disruption of civilian GPS services in the Baltic region. Perhaps even more worrying for NATO forces is that Russian forces have demonstrated the capability to rapidly adapt their EW tactics and waveforms to seriously degrade the accuracy of Western ground-launched and air-launched GPS-guided munitions. Generally, weapons such as the GMLRS rocket, GBU-62 JDAM and Excalibur GPS-guided artillery shell proved highly effective for the first month or two after they were supplied to Ukrainian forces, but once Russian EW operators started to dial in their effects, the performance of these systems began to rapidly degrade, to the point that in some cases they are now less precise than unguided equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the versions of weapons supplied to Ukraine may not be the most up to date in the NATO arsenal, due to security concerns around Russian capture of the most sensitive guidance kits, and so performance in Ukraine should not be taken as entirely indicative of a given weapon’s performance in NATO service. However, for the initial period of any clash with Russian forces, GPS guidance for existing weapons should not be assumed to be 100% reliable, and accuracy is likely to degrade fairly quickly after the initial few weeks of a conflict. Even where a high level of jamming resistance has been successfully designed into a weapon, it will still need to be rapidly upgraded once in service, or else risk losing effectiveness within months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net result is a need to invest in a greater number of weapons, ideally across a wider variety of types than a basic analysis of target numbers to stockpiles would suggest, since effectiveness will be degraded by GPS spoofing/denial and other EW techniques, as well as Russian SHORAD coverage. In addition, air forces will need to invest in improving the rate at which they upgrade weapon guidance/seeker programming and aircraft mission data to keep pace with the increasingly rapid pace of adversary EW adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, however, that if a successful SEAD/DEAD campaign can be mounted despite the likely denial or serious degradation of GPS in the first phases of a clash, airpower assets may be able to reduce the EW threat to munitions and sensors over time. This is because a NATO air campaign, in the wake of initial SEAD/DEAD successes, would probably include dedicated efforts to rapidly locate and destroy high-end Russian EW systems. Many of these EW systems must emit significant amounts of energy to have effects at longer ranges, and so can be detected and triangulated relatively easily, especially by the F-35 with its combination of sensor fusion, passive ELINT collection capabilities and geolocation capabilities. Destroying or suppressing major EW systems deployed by forward Russian forces would then allow effective use of GPS guidance against remaining Russian ground forces, at least in localised areas and/or for specific periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it appears to be an unavoidable conclusion that regenerating the wartime capacity of the non-US air forces in NATO in a defensive context against Russia in the short to medium term will require states to make hard prioritisation decisions on munitions stockpile investments. The counterinsurgency-era solution of a consolidated mix of precision-guided bombs and short-range missiles optimised for efficient low-volume production and low collateral damage cannot deliver what is needed for SEAD/DEAD, DCA, OCA or deep strike. The relatively high cost of the weapons required for these mission sets means that achieving adequate stockpiles to guarantee reasonable combat endurance and effectiveness will come at a major opportunity cost for most small/medium-sized air forces – unless they also receive significant increases in funding. Given limited industrial production capacity and consequent lengthy delays to desired delivery timescales for many advanced munition types, national specialisation choices on mission sets could also help to enable delivery schedule negotiations and optimisation within NATO for each munition class, replacing the current “first come, first served” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital that Russia be deterred from using a perceived window of opportunity to directly attack a NATO member’s territory if, in the coming years, the US is either militarily overstretched by a concurrent crisis in the Indo-Pacific, or appears to have politically disengaged from European defence commitments. Airpower is critical to rebuilding European NATO members’ ability to collectively repel and thereby deter opportunistic Russian aggression without large-scale reliance on US assets. Put bluntly: Russian leaders are very unlikely to take the risk of direct conflict if they believe that European NATO members can roll back Russia’s IADS through a SEAD/DEAD campaign and establish air superiority over any contested territory. It is difficult to see how non-US NATO members could achieve a similar level of conventional force overmatch in the medium term via any approach other than doubling down on airpower, given the many demographic, industrial and timeframe constraints on attempts to rapidly expand and reform land forces and navies. By contrast, the air assets required to conduct a successful SEAD/DEAD campaign and push back the VKS already largely exist in Europe, with the notable exception of sufficient specialised munitions stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it will take significant investment and focus to realise the latent potential of Europe’s air forces in a high-intensity context. In this context, a number of recommendations can be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There must be a wider recognition among air forces and ministries of defence that developing and maintaining aircrew proficiency and currency in many of the more complex mission sets – such as OCA, DCA and SEAD/DEAD – require a lot of both live and synthetic flying training time dedicated to those tasks. This means that maintaining multi-role proficiencies to the levels required will require either greater resources for core flying training, or greater mission specialisation and focus during training compared with the approach employed during the past few decades. While simulator time helps with the high-intensity side of aircrew proficiency generation and currency, there are only so many hours in the working week, especially if a small force is constantly deployed on real-world operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the high cost of flying hours for modern fast jets, it makes sense for countries that are unable to afford major increases in overall flying hours to concentrate a greater proportion of available flying training hours on the core tasks that they might credibly be allocated by NATO in a war. Such an approach might take the form of either a reduced mission liabilities set for squadrons or air forces as a whole; or a significant reduction in the tempo of overseas deployments and low-end exercise activities to allow the force to focus its valuable time on training for core mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the costs involved in purchasing relevant quantities of the specialised and expensive munitions needed for high-intensity conflict against Russian forces, there will be opportunity costs elsewhere in the inventory. Medium-sized air forces, therefore, should focus their efforts on specific mission sets rather than aim to purchase a full range of munitions types in totally inadequate quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where such specialisation decisions are to be made, however, they must be made in close coordination with other Allies and in accordance with an honest assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technical-and-geopolitical-considerations-for-implementation&quot;&gt;Technical and Geopolitical Considerations for Implementation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of assessments that ought to contribute to decisions on increasing the mission specialisation of a given air force, one of the most obvious being the inherent capabilities and drawbacks of its existing aircraft. For example, it makes little sense for a country that exclusively flies the F-35 to focus on DCA, since the aircraft is specifically designed for operations inside contested airspace, incurring a considerable cost and complexity premium to be able to do so. Essentially, the F-35 is a relatively inefficient asset for conducting QRA scrambles or holding DCA CAP stations to guard against hostile aircraft or missiles, at least compared with aircraft designed for those tasks, such as Typhoon or Gripen. Equally, for nations that operate exclusively 4th- or 4.5th-generation fighter fleets, a choice to focus on SEAD/DEAD and OCA would be comparatively inefficient, since, compared with the F-35, their assets inherently require a much greater degree of enablement and suppressive weapons use at scale to be survivable in a high-threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also political and geographical factors that might naturally lead certain NATO countries to choose to specialise in certain mission sets rather than others. For example, political conventions and constraints on the use of lethal force in Germany, alongside its geographic position at the heart of Europe, make it logical to suggest that the Luftwaffe focus primarily on DCA, and potentially supportive SEAD from stand-off, but not DEAD, OCA or deep strike. Experience from multiple conflicts since the end of the Cold War suggests that policy decisions in Berlin to authorise the Bundeswehr to take part in offensive strike operations as part of any NATO response to an attack by Russia would take significantly longer than in many other European capitals. In stark contrast, flying DCA CAPs and holding extended numbers of QRA assets at readiness in multiple locations would probably be authorised almost immediately. Given that the Luftwaffe already has a large and growing fleet of Eurofighter Typhoons, a decision to focus its capability-development efforts on acquiring large quantities of air-to-air munitions and realistic training and exercising for DCA at larger scale would make a great deal of sense. This might well come at the expense of integration and acquisition funding for other strike and stand-off weapons, and of training time for tasks such as interdiction and CAS. However, such a trade-off would be a price worth paying if it enabled Germany to demonstrate commitment to seriously enhancing its practical DCA and QRA capabilities in a NATO context. Such a demonstration by Germany could also provide risk mitigation, allowing Allies such as the Netherlands or Belgium – which have smaller fleets of F-35s – to take more risk on DCA and QRA training, readiness and weapons stocks, thus allowing them to focus on SEAD/DEAD and OCA. Clearly, geographical location relative to other Allied nations and proximity to various potential threat vectors will also influence the options that different countries feel that they have (or do not have) for taking on certain tasks or accepting risks against others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nordic Air Forces grouping is perhaps the best current example of the potential benefits available via cooperative specialisation. Norway and Finland – frontline states with both maritime and land borders with Russia – will soon operate fighter fleets solely comprising F-35As. Denmark will also shortly exchange its F-16s for F-35As, albeit at a significantly smaller scale. Sweden, by contrast, has a more protected land position, and operates a larger number of Gripen C/D (and soon new Gripen E) fighters. Following decades of close cooperation on a more ad hoc basis, these four air forces have recently committed to the Nordic air forces grouping, which includes a combined air operations centre. The joint planning visibility and regular exercises together allow each of the four nations to plan its own capability and training focus around a very significant level of trust in what the other three will provide in the event of a war. Sweden not only has more fighter aircraft than any of the other three Nordic states, but the Swedish Air Force can also afford to fly them more, as the Gripen is very economical to operate. Under the new concept, there is the opportunity for the Swedish Air Force to specialise in training and equipping its squadrons for DCA, ASuW and contested CAS. It can accept risk against penetrating OCA and SEAD/DEAD capabilities in the knowledge that Norwegian (and soon Finnish and Danish) F-35s will fight alongside it in any conflict against Russia, and will be well trained and equipped to cover those mission sets. The reverse is also true: Norway, Finland and Denmark can focus more of their F-35 weapons acquisition and training time on making the most of that platform’s inherent offensive potential, in the knowledge that they have a significant degree of defensive and anti-ship cover in the form of Swedish fighters that will operate with them in any conflict. As a result, the Nordic model promises to deliver collective combat capabilities that are significantly more potent than the four countries could achieve separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trust-burden-sharing-and-credibility&quot;&gt;Trust, Burden Sharing and Credibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any air forces looking to the model of cooperative specialisation, with all the benefits that it promises, the key point to remember is that such cooperation relies on trust. Trust must be built up through consistent practical demonstrations of both military capability and political commitment. Burden sharing only works if both parties take on burdensome responsibilities and prove that they can carry them out. However, if medium and smaller European NATO air forces take the Russian threat seriously and are committed to building up warfare readiness and capacity quickly to ensure it is deterred, then cooperative mission specialisation appears to offer the most efficient route to doing so within the resource constraints and force structures available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be seen as a step too far for the traditionally largest and arguably most capable European air forces – in particular the RAF and the Armée de l’Air et de l’Espace – which are culturally and doctrinally wedded to maintaining broad-spectrum forces. But the fact remains that, even for the UK and France, trying to maintain a broad-spectrum force on inadequate budgets with heavy deployment schedules for real world tasks over the past decades has led to varying degrees of hollowness across high-intensity mission readiness and a stark lack of suitable munitions stocks for defending NATO against Russian aggression. Unless funding is significantly increased and discretionary activity cut down to enable a greater focus on core NATO missions, greater mission specialisation may be needed here too – albeit with more choices available, thanks to the larger existing force structure of these two air forces than in the case of most other Allies. In the harsh light shone on Western forces, industrial capacity and political decision-making by Russia’s war on Ukraine, hollow forces appear far more obvious and far less credible to allies and adversaries alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talks to end the war in Ukraine are in motion. As the Trump administration seeks to keep its promise to end the war in Ukraine, negotiators must consider long-standing research on war termination and peace negotiations. Despite calls for a swift ceasefire, this body of work shows that peace talks tend to take longer than initially anticipated. War is an extension of politics, and negotiations are shaped by a broad range of factors beyond simply tallying battlefield successes or assessing when combatants will exhaust their resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), drawing on data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), found that 60 percent of all wars conclude through some form of compromise. While wars can end in various ways, a negotiated settlement remains a distinct option for Ukraine. Therefore, identifying the factors that influence the complex process of war termination is essential for understanding how negotiations between the United States, Russia, Ukraine, other key states in Europe, and the broader international community may unfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War negotiations are inherently complex, marked by uncertainty, competing interests, and shifting variables. While artificial intelligence (AI) can help navigate this complexity, its effectiveness depends on proper application. Large language models (LLMs) are generalists, but their outputs can be refined using techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), few-shot learning, and chain-of-thought reasoning. The key lies not only in the model itself but in the quality of the data and the sequencing of questions. By curating datasets focused on historical peace negotiations and structuring prompts to reflect real-world decisionmaking, AI moves beyond simple summarization to become a tool for systematically analyzing war termination and the challenging path toward a negotiated settlement in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report leverages AI to explore possible pathways to peace between Russia and Ukraine. Researchers at the CSIS Futures Lab applied foundational literature on peace negotiations in international relations (IR) to curate datasets and refine their approach to prompt engineering, incorporating techniques such as few-shot learning, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought reasoning. The study demonstrates that AI techniques like RAG can be effectively used to rapidly understand and summarize key documents related to a potential peace agreement in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LLM’s outputs provide key recommendations for policymakers and analysts assessing possible pathways to peace. First, territorial control and security guarantees will be central to any agreement. Both the AI-driven analysis using RAG and recent peace discussions in Munich and Riyadh highlight the significance of these factors. The findings of this report indicate that lasting peace requires a transparent, fair, and inclusive negotiation process—one that fully engages Ukraine and European states. This stands in contrast to emerging proposals that prioritize negotiations between Moscow and Washington while pressuring Ukraine into immediate elections and resource concessions. The real challenge isn’t merely bringing parties to the negotiating table but navigating the complex technical details that will shape long-term stability. Key issues include territorial arrangements, security guarantees, demilitarized zones, and verification mechanisms. The most difficult work in diplomacy lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, negotiators must identify clear trade-offs. Not all peace agreements follow the same blueprint. While historical precedent and AI-driven analysis emphasize the importance of postwar justice, economic recovery, and social welfare in achieving lasting peace, political realities will ultimately determine what is negotiable. Russia has hardened its demands rather than offering concessions, making prosecutions for war crimes—however justified—highly unlikely. Negotiators will have to balance upholding international norms with the imperative of ending the war. One area where leverage remains is economic reparations; if the international community is willing, frozen Russian assets could be seized to aid Ukraine’s reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, a lasting peace won’t be shaped solely by Ukraine and Russia—it will require sustained international involvement. Both historical research and AI-driven analysis confirm that third-party mediation, security guarantees, and enforcement mechanisms are essential to durable agreements. This dynamic is already unfolding, with Saudi Arabia emerging as a mediator between the United States and Russia. However, beyond facilitating talks, global actors must assume responsibility for monitoring, verifying, and enforcing postwar stability. The United States, in particular, faces a strategic decision: provide Ukraine with unconditional security support or risk long-term instability by demanding economic concessions in exchange for assistance. How Washington and its allies navigate this moment will not only determine the outcome of the war but also shape the credibility of future peace efforts worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, generative AI presents a powerful tool for foreign policy and national security, but it must be used wisely. Policymakers should experiment with AI for brainstorming and strategic analysis, but always in conjunction with expert judgment. The technology has clear limitations—without proper benchmarking and access to tailored, up-to-date data, LLMs cannot reliably generate accurate insights. To maximize effectiveness, policymakers must customize AI models for specific use cases, ensuring outputs align with real-world conditions and the broader bodies of knowledge that inform policy analysis. Ultimately, AI can process historical data and help structure policy discussions; however, it cannot replace the human decisionmaking that determines war and peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report begins by reviewing IR scholarship on war termination and peace processes, highlighting key drivers and roadblocks to achieving lasting peace. It then examines common techniques for working with generative AI, specifically RAG, to refine the performance of LLMs and improve model output. The third section applies the RAG approach to analyze peace agreement data and generate potential peace deals. The final section presents key takeaways and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-we-know-about-war-termination-and-peace-processes&quot;&gt;What Do We Know About War Termination and Peace Processes?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How wars start and end are central topics in IR. Scholars have identified numerous factors that influence peace negotiations and the terms of any eventual agreement. A key framework for understanding war termination is bargaining theory, which suggests that conflicts end when the perceived benefits of peace outweigh the costs of continued fighting. In this context, information plays a critical role, as combatants continually reassess their capabilities relative to those of their adversary. War, therefore, is not merely a failure of diplomacy but rather an extension of negotiations between belligerents in which coercion and force play a role. Accordingly, states are typically conceptualized as being able to rationally assess their position vis-à-vis a rival because the conflict’s progress provides information about what sort of negotiated settlement reflects—at least in a capabilities-focused conception of bargaining—the broader power differential between the belligerents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other dynamics, however, such as domestic political factors, will likely shape any peace negotiations. Scholars have highlighted how domestic political coalitions influence leaders’ calculations of the domestic political costs of defeat. Furthermore, shifts in domestic political coalitions can accelerate war termination by facilitating more effective reassessments of likely outcomes. However, domestic political factions have been shown to protect their interests in any international agreement, potentially complicating the route to a more “rational” negotiation outcome. In the case of a Ukraine-Russia peace deal, domestic “spoilers”—groups who seek to sabotage any peace process due to their own interests—could obstruct progress, making a mutually acceptable outcome more difficult to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarship has also demonstrated that more durable peace agreements often include civil society actors, such as local religious organizations or human rights groups. However, the question of who gets a “seat at the table” in peacemaking is influenced by both practical and normative considerations. Additionally, some form of justice—whether through post-conflict trials, truth commissions, or reparations—can, in certain cases, contribute to the durability of peace agreements. These factors, however, add further complications to the already challenging task of achieving successful peace negotiations and ensuring their subsequent implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the international community is likely to play a crucial role in conflict termination through mediation efforts. Research indicates that “non-coercive” third-party mediation, whether conducted by states or international institutions, can play a role in “softening up” belligerents’ war aims, facilitating a cessation of hostilities. Beyond mediation, the international community can help ensure the long-term viability of peace agreements by providing monitoring and verification of the terms, as well as offering security guarantees. This role is particularly significant in the case of Ukraine, where international oversight may be necessary to prevent Russia from exploiting any cessation in hostilities to rebuild, rearm, and resume its pursuit of war aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the aforementioned factors are likely to shape any negotiated peace settlement between Ukraine and all involved parties. For instance, years of war have provided information into both sides’ combat capabilities; however, uncertainty remains regarding the long-term military commitment of the United States and European states, as well as the financial resources available for Ukraine’s reconstruction. Moreover, as suggested in the literature on peace negotiations, domestic political factions, civil society actors, questions of justice, and the role of the international community could all shape the process. Any peace negotiations will, therefore, be highly complex, with numerous variables at play. To explore ways to creatively navigate this complexity, the CSIS Futures Lab employed AI-enabled tools to analyze historical peace agreements as well as current discussions aimed at ending the Russia-Ukraine war. The research team sought to generate possible parameters for an eventual settlement and to conceptualize different versions of a potential peace agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;applying-ai-to-analyze-war-and-peace&quot;&gt;Applying AI to Analyze War and Peace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the CSIS Futures Lab’s ongoing efforts to engage in data-driven analysis and experiment with AI-enabled technology, the research team took a creative approach to addressing the complex question of a potential peace agreement related to Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. To do so, the Futures Lab leveraged specifically tailored data sources, Scale AI’s Donovan platform (an AI-enabled data analysis tool), and a data query method known as RAG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While off-the-shelf LLMs can generate responses or summarize text across a wide range of domains, their accuracy—particularly in “knowledge-intensive tasks”—can be inconsistent. RAG enhances LLM performance by directing models to leverage specific data sources when generating outputs. This approach relies on two key elements: a “retriever,” which queries relevant documents from a specified data source, and a “generator,” which synthesizes and summarizes the retrieved information. By structuring AI outputs in this way, RAG helps mitigate model “hallucinations,” or the tendency of LLMs to produce false or misleading information. The result is a more precise, reliable, and contextually informed response tailored to specific user queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RAG is just one of several techniques that can enhance LLM outputs for domain-specific tasks. For example, “few-shot learning”—the practice of providing models with a small example set of demonstrations within a specific context—has been shown to improve model performance. This approach works by incorporating specific data examples and correct labeling within a model prompt. Further research suggests that combining multiple contextual prompts can enhance the effectiveness of in-context few-shot learning. In general, the goal is for models to use these examples to better understand the fundamental structure of a task. Additionally, chain-of-thought prompting—which involves breaking down each step in a task when prompting models and instructing them to decompose responses into intermediate steps—has demonstrated improvements in model outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For data, the research team leveraged two primary sources. The first was the full text of peace agreements compiled by the UCDP. The second was a collection of published articles curated by CSIS scholars, analyzing possible pathways to peace between Russia and Ukraine. These data sources were then uploaded to the Donovan platform to implement the RAG approach using commercially available LLMs. Donovan enabled the research team to better optimize search vectors from RAG across larger datasets—a key capability for employing LLMs to explore complex, high-context research areas such as peace negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team incorporated key elements of chain-of-thought prompting to support step-by-step reasoning. The prompting strategy began by first ensuring that the LLM, consistent with few-shot and in-context learning, properly understood the dataset. Next, the researchers directed the LLM to analyze peace agreements in general before narrowing the focus to Ukraine and the specific factors likely to shape the negotiation process. Finally, the model was tasked with exploring possible peace scenarios. This structured approach ensured a logical progression, establishing key analytical steps before prompting the LLM to generate sample peace agreements. In other words, sequencing the right questions is a deliberate strategy when employing LLMs to support foreign policy decisionmaking. Asking a vague or overly simplistic question yields a correspondingly simplistic response. However, posing a series of logically connected questions, grounded in a broader analytical framework, increases the likelihood of generating a well-calibrated and insightful response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described above, effectively employing AI to analyze complex, high-context tasks requires both gathering the right data and developing a tailored approach to prompting. When applied to generating possible peace agreements for Ukraine, this process necessitates collecting data on peace agreements in general, as well as ongoing, reputable accounts of negotiations. To that end, the research team created two datasets. The first dataset consisted of 333 peace agreements from between 1989 and 2018, compiled by the UCDP. Each entry contained the full text of the respective treaty. The second dataset, developed in collaboration with Ukrainian researchers, included 79 articles from major news outlets discussing potential peace talks. This effort built on the earlier CSIS Futures Lab series, Strategic Headwinds, which analyzed key factors shaping negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure below outlines the prompting strategy. First, the CSIS Futures Lab ensured that the model used historical peace agreements as an anchor for analyzing Ukraine. Second, the research team integrated current factors influencing peace negotiations in Ukraine. Third, the questions shifted toward identifying potential spoilers and roadblocks that could obstruct the peace process—an approach designed to mitigate confirmation bias and integrate red teaming techniques. With this contextual foundation, the research team then tasked the model with generating possible scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TimuKb0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Major Logical Categories for RAG Prompting and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial prompt asked the model to analyze the peace treaties in the UCDP dataset and identify common negotiation parameters. The model’s output highlights several key considerations that have shaped historical peace agreements. These include establishing a clear agenda and methodology for negotiations on specific issue areas, as well as creating timelines and processes for conducting negotiations. Security guarantees and shared principles—such as territorial integrity—emerge as common factors across agreements. Moreover, the analysis indicates that monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are frequent features in historical peace agreements. Finally, the output suggests that economic factors and social welfare issues, including land access, economic development, and human rights, have played a role in shaping historical peace outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the model’s analysis, historical trends indicate that, over time, peace agreements have increasingly emphasized human rights and economic cooperation, and they tend to be more comprehensive while also involving the international community to a greater extent. These findings align with IR scholarship on war termination and peace agreements, which highlights the importance of security guarantees and addressing considerations such as human rights abuses that may have occurred during a conflict. Additionally, studies have shown that peace negotiations placed greater emphasis on human rights in the first decade of the 2000s compared to the previous decade. However, since 2010, there has been growing pessimism about incorporating human rights stipulations into peace mediation efforts. Consequently, these nuances suggest that a model’s empirical claims should always be validated through ongoing research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a better understanding of the general parameters of the historical peace agreements, the research team next prompted the model to summarize the main points of the collected articles discussing possible peace processes between Ukraine and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model’s output for this second prompt indicates that security guarantees—particularly Ukraine’s relationship with NATO—will be crucial for maintaining Ukraine’s territorial integrity. However, this could conflict with Russia’s interest in ensuring Ukraine remains neutral. Similarly, territorial disputes, including the status of areas currently occupied by Russian forces, are likely to be central to any negotiation. Additionally, Russia would likely demand assurances regarding sanctions relief. Beyond NATO, Ukraine’s potential membership in international organizations, such as the European Union, is also expected to shape negotiation parameters. Finally, the model’s analysis suggests that ceasefire agreements and monitoring mechanisms will be essential for ensuring the durability of any settlement. As with the first prompt, the model’s output aligns with key considerations identified in IR research on war termination. These include the role of the international community in monitoring agreements and the divergent interests surrounding Ukraine’s postwar status—particularly its aspirations to join NATO and the European Union. In the context of a bargaining model of war termination, such factors are likely to be central points of negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team also wanted to ascertain whether the RAG methodology could help identify potential roadblocks to successful negotiations. To this end, the model was prompted to generate possible obstructions to a peace deal. The model’s output suggests that power imbalances between Ukraine and Russia, as well as divergent views on territorial control in regions such as Crimea, could hinder an agreement. Additionally, while Ukraine is likely to want robust security guarantees and possibly NATO membership, this remains a major sticking point for Russia. These factors highlight the ongoing competing interests and strategic priorities of both states in the war. Model analysis also underscores possible domestic factors, such as public opinion, political factions favoring a more hardline approach, and spoiler groups that could undermine the negotiation process. Furthermore, a lack of trust between the belligerents could reduce the likelihood of an agreement and complicate effective monitoring and verification. Here, the conclusions of IR research are particularly relevant. For example, existing models recognize the role of domestic actors and spoiler groups as potential barriers to achieving a lasting peace. Moreover, the balance of power has long been a central theoretical consideration in assessing outcomes in international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final stage, the research team tested if this approach could generate different versions of peace agreements to assist analysts in thinking through alternative negotiated settlements. To achieve this, the model was prompted to generate three peace agreements, each with distinct parameters. The first agreement was a minimalist agreement, representing the least stringent version of a peace settlement generated by the model. Its key provisions include an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. However, it does not provide security guarantees for Ukraine, address competing territorial claims, or consider Ukraine’s potential NATO membership. Additionally, under this version of the deal, the international community would not offer technical assistance, monitoring, or support during the implementation phase.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second agreement was a moderate agreement, which also includes an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. Additionally, it calls for the establishment of a buffer zone, along with international monitoring and verification. Beyond these measures, it introduces limited security guarantees through a nonaggression pact between the belligerents. While Ukraine would regain some of its internationally recognized territory, it would not recover all prewar land. Furthermore, Ukraine would agree to neutrality while expanding economic ties in trade and the energy sector. This agreement envisions a more substantial role for the international community, including the provision of technical assistance and support throughout the implementation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the third agreement was a comprehensive and ambitious agreement. This version incorporates all the components outlined in the previous two agreements. However, it also includes security guarantees that may be unappealing from a U.S./European perspective and within the current Ukrainian domestic political landscape. Specifically, it proposes a mutual defense pact between Ukraine and Russia. Moreover, the agreement stipulates Ukrainian-Russian cooperation on economic and security issues, including counterterrorism and nonproliferation efforts. In return, Russia agrees to withdraw all troops from disputed territories and formally recognize Ukrainian sovereignty over its internationally recognized land. Additionally, this version of the deal includes provisions for reconciliation and accountability, addressing human rights violations and war crimes committed during the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even in the above output, the comprehensive agreement produces parameters that some may deem unfavorable to Ukraine. To account for this, the research team prompted the model to generate an alternative deal that aligns more closely with Ukrainian interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version of the agreement closely resembles the comprehensive agreement discussed above, particularly on issues related to Ukrainian territorial claims and addressing human rights violations and war crimes. However, one key difference is that this version does not include a Ukrainian-Russian defense pact. Instead, it grants Ukraine the autonomy to join NATO in the future. There is, however, a slight inconsistency in the agreement’s parameters. In this version, Ukraine agrees to maintain its “nonaligned” status, with the option to join organizations such as NATO at a later stage. It is unclear how agreeing to maintain a nonaligned status is compatible with any eventual plan to join the NATO alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, outputs leveraging RAG highlight several notable points. First, in the general analysis of the UCDP data and Ukrainian peace agreement articles, model outputs identified many agreement parameters consistent with those acknowledged in the IR literature. These include the importance of security guarantees, a role for the international community, and considerations of domestic political factors. These findings suggest that LLMs are capable of recognizing broader trends in data, which can be useful for reflecting core topics of discussion in the field of IR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, in terms of themes across the data specific to a Ukrainian peace deal, model output illustrates that issues of territorial integrity and Ukrainian neutrality emerge as key points of concern. For example, the model identifies that difficulties in negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are likely to center around each country’s competing territorial claims and how territory currently occupied by Russian forces will be divided among the belligerents. Additionally, Ukraine’s relationship with NATO is a point of contention. Model outputs indicate discussions of Russian desires for Ukrainian neutrality within the articles in the dataset. However, due to long-term security concerns, the data suggests that Ukraine would likely prefer to join NATO to help guarantee that Russia will not take advantage of a ceasefire to rearm for a new stage in the conflict down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, as instructed, the approach of using RAG linked to specified data sources was able to generate alternatives for a peace deal, with each proposal varying in the level of comprehensiveness. The model-generated output was able to recognize many crucial points of discussion that are likely to shape any real-world negotiations. However, initial output demonstrated inconsistencies in how variations of a peace deal addressed territorial disputes between Ukraine and Russia. This required tweaking initial prompts to achieve improved results and logically consistent treaty parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, and problematic from a Ukrainian and U.S./European strategic viewpoint, the most comprehensive version of a deal generated by the model resulted in a Ukrainian-Russian mutual defense agreement, rather than Ukraine joining NATO. Considering Ukraine’s stated desire to join NATO and concerns that Russia may restart hostilities from a more advantageous position following any pause in the conflict, such an outcome diverges from the preferences of many Western states. Therefore, generating a deal more desirable to Ukraine using RAG required specific prompting to direct the model to create a deal more favorable to Ukrainian interests. In this version of the deal, Ukraine is directed to initially retain its neutrality but has the freedom to join international organizations, such as NATO, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-ai-to-policy-and-parameters-of-a-future-deal&quot;&gt;From AI to Policy and Parameters of a Future Deal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s analysis, combining historical research and AI-driven modeling, identifies four core takeaways for policymakers navigating ongoing peace negotiations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Territorial control and security guarantees will define any deal.&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine’s future relationship with NATO and its territorial integrity remain the central issues in negotiations. While full NATO membership may face obstacles, alternative security guarantees from Europe or the United States could provide a viable path forward. However, Ukraine must be an active participant in negotiations—excluding Kyiv and focusing talks solely between Moscow and Washington risks backfiring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political realities will constrain peace terms.&lt;/strong&gt; While postwar justice, economic recovery, and social welfare are ideal components of durable agreements, Russia’s hardline stance makes concessions on war crimes trials unlikely. Negotiators must weigh international norms against the need for a practical settlement. One area where leverage remains is economic reparations—seizing frozen Russian assets could support Ukraine’s reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The international community will determine whether peace holds.&lt;/strong&gt; Third-party mediation, security guarantees, and long-term enforcement mechanisms will be critical. Recent diplomacy, such as Saudi Arabia’s role in talks, highlights the need for global engagement. However, without credible monitoring and enforcement, a ceasefire could become a temporary pause before renewed conflict. The United States must also balance its security commitments with the reputational risks of demanding economic concessions from Ukraine in exchange for aid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI can support negotiations, but it won’t replace strategic judgment.&lt;/strong&gt; Generative AI can help analyze historical agreements, structure policy discussions, and generate alternative scenarios. However, tailored data and expert oversight are essential—AI is a tool for analysis, not a substitute for political decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the analysis demonstrates that issues of territorial claims between the two belligerents, as well as security guarantees for Ukraine, will be core factors shaping any peace negotiations. In all variations of the deal generated by RAG, these issues emerged as key points of dialogue. Moreover, the findings align with ongoing political developments, as discussions of peace underscore the prominence of these themes. Model analysis of the collected texts indicates significant barriers to Ukraine’s NATO accession. However, this may not be the case for Ukraine attaining post-conflict security guarantees from Europe or the United States. The importance of these factors has been driven home by the recent discussions of a peace deal in both Munich and Saudi Arabia. Within these contexts, European states have proposed stationing forces in Ukraine for peacekeeping purposes, while Russia has demanded a retraction of the 2008 promise to allow Ukraine to join NATO at a future date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, making progress in these areas will require Ukrainian involvement. Notably, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky postponed a planned trip to Saudi Arabia in hopes of diminishing the legitimacy of the recent talks between the United States and Russia. Policymakers must recognize that Ukraine retains the agency to accept or reject any deal, even amid an increasingly precarious military situation. This report’s analysis of historical peace agreements suggests that establishing a clear agenda and methodology for negotiations is important for achieving success. Future negotiations must acknowledge that this framework needs to include key political actors, such as Ukraine and Europe, to ensure a durable peace. Zelensky himself has emphasized this necessity, stating, “For the war to end with a reliable and lasting peace, no mistakes must be allowed. This is possible only when negotiations are fair, and guarantees are developed with the participation of all those who are truly capable of providing them.” Excluding Ukraine and Europe from the negotiation process could, therefore, have detrimental consequences. While the Trump administration may perceive direct talks with Moscow as the most expedient path to an agreement, such an approach risks undermining the legitimacy and sustainability of any potential settlement if key players are not involved. The fact is, research indicates that successful peace negotiations should not prioritize expediency at the expense of exclusivity, as agreements that exclude critical parties are less likely to endure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, in terms of themes across the data specific to a Ukrainian peace deal, model output illustrates that issues of territorial integrity and Ukrainian neutrality emerge as key points of concern. For example, the model identifies that difficulties in negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are likely to center around each country’s competing territorial claims and how territory currently occupied by Russian forces will be divided among the belligerents. Additionally, Ukraine’s relationship with NATO is a point of contention. Model outputs indicate discussions of Russian desires for Ukrainian neutrality within the articles in the dataset. However, due to long-term security concerns, the data suggests that Ukraine would likely prefer to join NATO to help guarantee that Russia will not take advantage of a ceasefire to rearm for a new stage in the conflict down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, as instructed, the approach of using RAG linked to specified data sources was able to generate alternatives for a peace deal, with each proposal varying in the level of comprehensiveness. The model-generated output was able to recognize many crucial points of discussion that are likely to shape any real-world negotiations. However, initial output demonstrated inconsistencies in how variations of a peace deal addressed territorial disputes between Ukraine and Russia. This required tweaking initial prompts to achieve improved results and logically consistent treaty parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, and problematic from a Ukrainian and U.S./European strategic viewpoint, the most comprehensive version of a deal generated by the model resulted in a Ukrainian-Russian mutual defense agreement, rather than Ukraine joining NATO. Considering Ukraine’s stated desire to join NATO and concerns that Russia may restart hostilities from a more advantageous position following any pause in the conflict, such an outcome diverges from the preferences of many Western states. Therefore, generating a deal more desirable to Ukraine using RAG required specific prompting to direct the model to create a deal more favorable to Ukrainian interests. In this version of the deal, Ukraine is directed to initially retain its neutrality but has the freedom to join international organizations, such as NATO, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s analysis, combining historical research and AI-driven modeling, identifies four core takeaways for policymakers navigating ongoing peace negotiations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Territorial control and security guarantees will define any deal.&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine’s future relationship with NATO and its territorial integrity remain the central issues in negotiations. While full NATO membership may face obstacles, alternative security guarantees from Europe or the United States could provide a viable path forward. However, Ukraine must be an active participant in negotiations—excluding Kyiv and focusing talks solely between Moscow and Washington risks backfiring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political realities will constrain peace terms.&lt;/strong&gt; While postwar justice, economic recovery, and social welfare are ideal components of durable agreements, Russia’s hardline stance makes concessions on war crimes trials unlikely. Negotiators must weigh international norms against the need for a practical settlement. One area where leverage remains is economic reparations—seizing frozen Russian assets could support Ukraine’s reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The international community will determine whether peace holds.&lt;/strong&gt; Third-party mediation, security guarantees, and long-term enforcement mechanisms will be critical. Recent diplomacy, such as Saudi Arabia’s role in talks, highlights the need for global engagement. However, without credible monitoring and enforcement, a ceasefire could become a temporary pause before renewed conflict. The United States must also balance its security commitments with the reputational risks of demanding economic concessions from Ukraine in exchange for aid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI can support negotiations, but it won’t replace strategic judgment.&lt;/strong&gt; Generative AI can help analyze historical agreements, structure policy discussions, and generate alternative scenarios. However, tailored data and expert oversight are essential—AI is a tool for analysis, not a substitute for political decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the analysis demonstrates that issues of territorial claims between the two belligerents, as well as security guarantees for Ukraine, will be core factors shaping any peace negotiations. In all variations of the deal generated by RAG, these issues emerged as key points of dialogue. Moreover, the findings align with ongoing political developments, as discussions of peace underscore the prominence of these themes. Model analysis of the collected texts indicates significant barriers to Ukraine’s NATO accession. However, this may not be the case for Ukraine attaining post-conflict security guarantees from Europe or the United States.

&lt;p&gt;That said, making progress in these areas will require Ukrainian involvement. Notably, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky postponed a planned trip to Saudi Arabia in hopes of diminishing the legitimacy of the recent talks between the United States and Russia. Policymakers must recognize that Ukraine retains the agency to accept or reject any deal, even amid an increasingly precarious military situation. This report’s analysis of historical peace agreements suggests that establishing a clear agenda and methodology for negotiations is important for achieving success.

The fact is, research indicates that successful peace negotiations should not prioritize expediency at the expense of exclusivity, as agreements that exclude critical parties are less likely to endure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, generative AI, particularly techniques for refining LLM outputs like RAG and chain-of-thought prompting, can provide valuable insights for policymakers working toward a Ukraine-Russia peace settlement. When applied correctly, AI can summarize historical peace agreements, identify key negotiation patterns, and test alternative settlement scenarios. However, for AI to be effective in shaping the Ukraine peace process, it must be integrated thoughtfully alongside expert judgment and real-time intelligence. Policymakers should consider the following best practices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using AI for comparative analysis.&lt;/strong&gt; AI can assess past conflicts involving territorial disputes, security guarantees, and international mediation, offering insights into potential roadblocks and successful settlement strategies. When combined with basic data science and statistical methods, this approach provides a solid analytical foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applying structured prompting.&lt;/strong&gt; Logical, step-by-step questioning improves AI-generated outputs, ensuring they align with Ukraine’s core interests and avoid assumptions favoring Russian demands. Documenting the structure of the prompt sequence also enables alternative analyses, which are critical for complex policy issues like war termination and peace negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporating expert validation.&lt;/strong&gt; AI-generated scenarios must be assessed by national security experts—from diplomats to military leaders—to determine their feasibility given current political and battlefield realities. This validation process can further refine model outputs through techniques like reinforcement learning with human feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customizing data inputs.&lt;/strong&gt; AI must be trained on the latest intelligence and negotiation positions, not just historical agreements, to ensure relevance in a fast-changing conflict. The challenge for analysts is how to weight current events in relation to the larger model and key concepts derived from techniques like graph theory and how models understand key relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging AI for scenario planning.&lt;/strong&gt; By generating multiple versions of a peace agreement—from minimal ceasefire terms to comprehensive security frameworks—AI can help negotiators assess trade-offs and anticipate Russian counteroffers as counterfactuals. This type of analysis supports the identification of key negotiation positions that maximize U.S., Ukrainian, and European interests across the broadest range of possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its strengths, AI is not a substitute for human negotiation, nor can it fully capture the complexity of war termination in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The war’s evolving nature presents challenges that AI alone cannot resolve. AI struggles to adapt to rapid shifts in U.S., European, and Ukrainian political dynamics, as models trained on past agreements cannot account for these changes without constant data updates. Additionally, without precise prompting, AI-generated peace scenarios risk defaulting to compromises that align with neither the United States’ nor Ukraine’s national interests. While AI can highlight broad themes like territorial disputes and ceasefire terms, it lacks specificity on implementation details such as monitoring mechanisms, verification protocols, and postwar security guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These gaps underscore that policymakers must avoid treating AI as a shortcut to diplomacy. AI can help structure negotiations, but it can’t replace strategy. War termination is ultimately a political process, not a computational exercise. While AI-driven tools like RAG can surface insights from historical agreements and test potential settlement scenarios, peace is achieved through intelligence assessments, strategic trade-offs, and tough diplomatic engagement—not automated outputs alone. This analysis suggests that AI tools do not serve as a replacement for human judgment, expertise, and creativity. Nor can models independently align with the political and strategic goals of their users, nor account for human factors such as emotion or individual leadership characteristics that shape foreign policy outcomes. To make AI useful, policymakers must treat it as a force multiplier, not a decisionmaker. That requires constantly refining prompts, integrating the latest battlefield and political intelligence, and applying expert validation to ensure AI-generated insights align with Ukraine’s security needs and long-term stability. The key isn’t just using AI—it’s using it wisely, critically, and in service of strategic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎當時知道文章呼籲外國針對中國實施制裁和敵對行動。黎重申沒有閱讀過文章，也不認識作者，「我怎樣知道？」控方問黎不是一直以來提倡制裁，因此與作者想法一致？黎不同意，又稱：「因為《國安法》之後，我不再有相同的觀點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;針對黎聲稱未曾閱讀上文，法官李運騰指，黎基於特別原因而推行英文版，並且安排人手，對於哪類新聞要放入英文版很緊張，希望能吸引足夠讀者，「英文版很像是你的親生仔」，問黎從沒有閱讀過英文版的文章嗎？黎說沒有，只是在最初階段閱讀過馮偉光給他看的文章樣本。但後來在控方盤問下，黎稱有時會「瞥一眼」國際新聞的標題，因為需要檢查，惟他稱沒有檢查過英文版評論文章的標題，「我假定他（馮）會非常謹慎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎早前說過他並未有個別地提醒高層，怎樣知道馮偉光會非常謹慎？黎指馮有出席會議，曾徵詢律師的法律意見等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，員工行事謹慎是因為聽從黎的編採指示？黎否認。控方續質疑，黎曾說過他是老闆？黎同意他是老闆，「但不代表我要知道所有事情。」黎又指，過去只有一次他非常堅持己見，但是大部分時候他對很多事情都沒有意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦質疑，《蘋果》尋找海外作者的目的，是因為他們知道即使他們寫的文章觸犯《國安法》，也不會被繩之於法。黎否認，強調《國安法》生效之後，很多作者停止或放棄撰文，因他們憂慮紅線，可是《蘋果》要繼續營運下去，所以需要尋找新作者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎還柙後籲張繼續營運蘋果-假定員工已經很小心&quot;&gt;黎還柙後籲張繼續營運《蘋果》 假定員工已經很小心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，黎於2020年12月3日還柙。《蘋果》在12月5日發表頭版報導，提及：「身陷牢獄的黎智英沒被嚇倒，他昨日透過親友及律師向《蘋果》同事及讀者說：『No fear, we have to fight on.』」黎庭上確認報導刊出之前，有人探訪過他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹於同月到監獄探望黎。張早前供稱，在探訪期間黎要求張繼續經營《蘋果》，說：「唔使怕，繼續做，繼續做落去，照原來咁做。」黎今稱，他是叫張繼續營運《蘋果》這盤生意，而不是叫他在編採方面採用以往方式，但他有提醒張要小心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎認為其他員工知道要小心嗎？黎指他們當然知道，他們曾出席會議、獲得律師意見、有在 Slack 群組表達對《國安法》的憂慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;後來在控方追問下，黎改口稱不記得自己有否提醒張要小心。他稱張當時對是否繼續營運《蘋果》感到憂慮，所以他回應只需繼續營運下去。至於其他員工，「我假定他們已經很小心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指顏純鈎提倡制裁-黎指文章談論拜登-質疑何以牽扯到香港&quot;&gt;控方指顏純鈎提倡制裁 黎指文章談論拜登 質疑何以牽扯到香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，張劍虹在2021年2月10日再次到監獄探訪黎。翌日，《蘋果》論壇版刊登了顏純鈎（筆名方圓）所撰寫的社評〈拜登政府的外交難題〉。當中提及：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;美軍三大航母戰鬥群全調到亞太地區，雖是對中共的戰略威懾，但航母能來也能去，如不能扼止中共侵擾台灣，也只是耍耍花槍；緬甸軍事政變，美國僅有口頭譴責，無法扭轉局勢；圭亞那允許台灣設辦事處，僅一天又反悔，證明美國連家門口一個小國家都搞唔掂；華為是否列入制裁名單，新政府官員顧左右而言他，顯示底氣不足的窘態。凡此種種，都不是好迹象，說明拜登外交政策舉步維艱。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;競爭就是一種威脅，威脅也是一種競爭，競爭去到「最嚴峻」的地步還不構成威脅，那競爭就不是競爭了，不如大家坐下來飲杯茶食個包，拍張照握個手，從此好來好去。拜登外交荊棘滿途，起步不順，並沒有那麼樂觀。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，作者是否提倡制裁？黎稱，顏只是描述拜登當時面對的難題。控方追問，所以作者希望拜登好像特朗普般強硬？黎重申，作者沒有說他想，他只是在說拜登面對的難題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問作者的觀點是否與黎的觀點一致？黎僅稱他沒有談論過拜登。控方則反駁指，黎曾經向美國退休軍官 Jack Keane 談及拜登，追問黎與顏是否持相同立場？黎繼續重申顏只是描述拜登所面對的難題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後指，黎當時知道文章是在呼籲制裁和敵對行動、有意圖引起憎恨政府、激使別人以非法手段改變現有合法制度、慫使他人不守法。黎一概否認，強調文章沒有說過任何制裁話題，又指文章談論拜登，「你怎樣能牽扯到香港上？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指文章僅分析拜登政策沒提制裁-質疑控方就算hello-kitty你也可以問相同問題&quot;&gt;黎指文章僅分析拜登政策沒提制裁 質疑控方「就算Hello Kitty你也可以問相同問題」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示另一篇由顏純鈎（筆名方圓）所撰寫的社評〈蘋論：陰乾中共？摸一摸拜登對華政策的脈搏（之一）〉，於2021年2月25日刊登在《蘋果》論壇版。當中提及美國「要佔有高科技和網絡空間的主動權」、「盟國之間要加強合作，不能單打獨鬥，要統一行動，不能各行其是。惟有合作，才能造成對中共長期有效的圍堵」、「應該以長期的競爭來削弱中共的力量，可能的話，迫使中共就範，遵從國際規則，不能的話，就陰乾中共，讓它自行枯萎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，文章所述是否符合黎所提倡的觀點，包括黎想外國懲罰中國、削弱中共的力量、想美國繼續實施科技禁運。黎則稱他沒有說過想美國繼續科技禁運。控方追問，那麼黎希望美國繼續科技禁運嗎？黎多次重申，他沒有這樣說過，所以他不希望。惟控方和法官均質疑黎答非所問。黎強調，如果他希望某事情的話，他會說出來，但是他從沒說過希望美國繼續科技禁運，證明他並不希望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎當時知道文章呼籲制裁和敵對行動。黎反問控方，文章哪裡提及制裁，反指文章只是分析拜登的政策。黎批評：「如果這樣可以是呼籲制裁，那麼就算 Hello Kitty 你也可以問相同的問題！」法官杜麗冰打斷，指法庭昨日已向黎解釋過，控方只是履行其責任向黎指出案情，黎只需回答同意或不同意，這樣的話「我們可以很快地完成。」黎最終對控方問題表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，文章有意圖引起憎恨政府、激使別人以非法手段改變現有合法制度、慫使他人不守法。黎一概否認，又指文章從未談及香港和法律。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏撰文談及快必煽動案-控方質疑非事實全貌&quot;&gt;陳沛敏撰文談及快必煽動案 控方質疑非事實全貌&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏撰寫的專欄文章〈這星期給香港人的通識題〉，於2020年9月12日刊登在《蘋果》。控方引述：「《蘋果》大部份黃絲讀者當然會答B and C；他們憎恨、藐視特區政府，但絕對不是因為聽了快必喊那些口號，而是導致這些口號出現的事件、制度、人物。」控方指黎是《蘋果》讀者之一，所以便是「憎恨、藐視特區政府」的人之一？黎說不是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另引述其中一段：「政權以言入罪，大興文字獄，無所不用其極。國安法下，「光復香港、時代革命」是罪；幾百萬香港人喊了超過一年的「五大訴求，缺一不可」呢？國安法不適用，就用陳年惡法殺無赦吧。」控方指文章未有提及人們在什麼情況之下叫喊口號，也沒有提及是一次性事件還是持續一段時間，質疑文章描述的畫面似乎並不準確。控方問黎，是否知道文章描述的畫面並非事實的全部，單是閱讀這篇文章，讀者未能得知事實的全貌。黎僅稱：「我不知道讀者會怎麼想。」控方質疑這是一個不實指控，沒有任何基礎，問黎是否同意？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問，黎有否就這篇文章跟陳沛敏商討。黎表示沒有。控方指出，黎閱讀過這篇文章，知道文章有意圖引起對政府憎恨、有意加深香港居民間的不滿，而黎並未有要求陳沛敏不要寫或不要發表這篇文章。黎一概否認，又指：「她有權利寫她想寫的東西，她是社長。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎在節目將其拘捕與中共扣連-只是臆測&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎在節目將其拘捕與中共扣連 只是臆測&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著圍繞網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」裡，黎涉煽動的言論提問。在2020年8月18日播出的一集，黎談及他在8月10日首次被捕的感受：「我被上了一個手銬，只為了顯示，我們正面對一個怎樣的政權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何有上述言論，黎稱當時他相信警察拘捕他是出於政治原因，希望觀眾醒覺。控方質疑：「這是你的猜測。」黎回應：「在我良心的呼聲之下。」控方指，警察拘捕黎的時候，他們沒提及過任何中共的事，質疑黎的言論只是臆測。黎重覆回答：「這是我良心的呼聲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方強調，黎被拘捕是因為警方懷疑他干犯煽動和勾結外國勢力罪，與中共沒有關係，這代表黎沒有任何基礎去把他的拘捕扣連到中共。黎僅回答：「這是我良心的呼聲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎意圖藉上述言論煽惑對中央的憎恨，並蓄意將他的拘捕與中共扣連，嘗試引起恐懼。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎節目稱中國價值觀入侵國際事務-比俄羅斯入侵烏克蘭更加可怕&quot;&gt;黎節目稱中國價值觀入侵國際事務 比俄羅斯入侵烏克蘭更加可怕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在對談中稱，中國以他們的價值觀，「這種隨意的價值觀、獨裁的價值觀，去入侵國際事務」，而這種入侵「其實等同於入侵小國家，例如俄羅斯入侵烏克蘭，甚至更加可怕。」控方質疑上述言論沒有任何基礎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另質疑黎在節目中鼓吹不同國家聯合起來應對中國；黎同意，因要避免中國價值的污染。控方續指，其中一個方法是懲罰中國？黎否認這樣說過。控方指黎在節目中作出的指控是沒有任何基礎。黎回應：「我的基礎是我所知道的事情，而且中國有很多麻煩。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎的節目言論意圖引起觀眾對中央政府憎恨、蔑視和不滿。黎否認。控方續指，黎鼓吹國際社會針對中國採取威脅措施。黎稱當時這情況在國際社會中已經發生，與他無關，惟他稱不想國際社會實施制裁和敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在節目中稱：「這是世界正要面對的一大疑問，如果我們不能改變中國，中國如此龐大，會反過來改變我們。」控方質疑黎不是在鼓吹觀眾聯手改變中國嗎？黎稱當時只是提出疑問，又堅稱沒有說過希望觀眾改變中國，自己亦不希望改變中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另引述黎的言論：「讓香港人不再如此擔憂，我們要真的站起來，繼續下去，顯示無論發生了什麼事，我們需要繼續做我們應該做的事。」控方質疑，儘管當時《國安法》已經實施，黎依然呼籲人們抗爭及站起來對抗中國。黎則堅稱，他只是說有很多人站起來。控方指相關言論意圖激使他人以非法手段改變合法制度、慫使他人不守法等。黎否認，強調他的意圖只是緩和人們的擔憂情緒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎未在節目提及國安法有條文保障人權-黎稱不相信&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎未在節目提及《國安法》有條文保障人權 黎稱不相信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另向黎出示2020年11月20日播出的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」謄本。當中黎稱在如此高壓的迫害及對自由法治的打壓之下，「無可避免地我們的希望會被破滅，我們愈使希望破滅，我們便會愈弱勢。」黎在庭上稱「高壓的迫害」是指中共對香港的迫害，而「對自由法治的打壓」則指實施《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎並未有在節目中提及《國安法》有條文規定保障和捍衛人權，問黎當時是否知道有相關條文。黎僅稱：「我還知道我們的自由和法治被打壓。」控方指黎並不是在回答問題，並重覆問題。黎回應：「但是我所見到的行動，與官方所宣稱的不同。」控方第三度問同一問題，要求黎回答。黎最後稱：「我知道（有相關條文），但我不相信它。」控方問，是否因為這個原因，黎才沒有在任何節目中提及保障人權的條文？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎有意藉言論引起人們對特區和中央政府的不滿，以及有意煽惑觀眾對中共不滿。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎明知是大罪而繼續勾結外國勢力-黎純粹與外國人對談&quot;&gt;控方指黎明知是大罪而繼續勾結外國勢力 黎：純粹與外國人對談&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述黎在節目中稱：「我愈是身處險境，我便愈有效地使外界留意香港人。」控方質疑這是黎的臆測，目的是引起人們恐懼。黎否認，因其言論不能被理解為引起恐懼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官李素蘭提問下，黎稱若然他被捕的話，國際媒體會作出報導。李素蘭問，國際媒體對黎感興趣？黎稱國際媒體對很多人都感興趣，他是其中之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中提到勾結外國勢力是大罪，「但是我要繼續及維護我們一直在做的事情，因為有那麼多人敬仰我。如果我退縮，他們也會退縮。」控方問黎知道勾結外國勢力是嚴重罪行？黎稱根據他的政治經驗，與外國人談話有可能被理解為勾結外國勢力，但他自己不認為純粹與外國人談話便構成罪行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則指，黎明知道勾結外國勢力是大罪，儘管如此，黎有意圖繼續做有關行為。黎則堅稱他在節目中的意思是繼續與外國人對話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問黎，誰是黎口中的外國人？黎僅稱美國人和英國人。控方接著問，誰是敬仰黎的香港人，是否包括另一被告陳梓華？因陳也是香港人。黎反問：「但你也是香港人，難道你敬仰我？」，遭法官杜麗冰打斷。黎最終回答，不認為陳梓華敬仰他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續追問，那麼誰是敬仰黎的香港人？黎指持相同立場的人。控方指，陳梓華也是持相同立場的人？黎稱他不知道陳是否敬仰他。控方指，黎曾要求陳聯絡勇武派平息暴力，黎亦向陳說過會以身作則？黎反駁稱沒有向陳說過以身作則，是陳編造故事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎當時意圖繼續國際游說，爭取國際支持及推動制裁和敵對行動。黎否認，強調在《國安法》生效後，這會構成勾結外國勢力，而他沒有意圖干犯法律。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問，黎是否意圖營造一個形象，顯示他不會退縮，儘管有關行為在《國安法》生效後變成非法。黎否認，並且強調自己沒說過跟外國人對談是非法，他只是說該行為可能被理解為非法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎在節目稱習近平不想聆聽反對聲音-所以要打壓及清除香港人&quot;&gt;黎在節目稱習近平不想聆聽反對聲音 所以要打壓及清除香港人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎另在節目中表示：「因為我們不是紅衛兵，我們是香港抗爭者⋯⋯反抗奪走我們法治和自由的獨裁政權。」控方問黎抗爭的對象是什麼？黎稱反抗《國安法》。控方反駁指，但當時《國安法》已經實施及生效。黎則稱：「我們以我們的情緒、以我們的意志來抗爭。」控方追問以什麼方式？黎稱：「純粹不喜歡壓迫我們的事物」，又稱在精神上和情緒上抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續追問：「怎樣（抗爭）？」黎僅稱：「純粹不喜歡。」控方又問，黎會表達感受嗎？黎則稱不必表達出來，因《國安法》之後這可能變成非法，「但是我可以用我的意志、用我的情緒抗爭。」控方問黎是否呼籲人們以情緒抗爭？黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目稱，中國文化大革命是毛澤東透過權鬥來清除敵人，可是習近平沒有清除敵人，然而他清除香港人。黎又指習不想聆聽反對聲音，所以習要打壓及清除香港人。控方質疑黎在節目中所作出的指控是完全無基礎。黎否認，強調整個香港被打壓，香港已沒有任何反對的聲音。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎的言論意圖引起恐懼、煽惑對習近平的憎恨、激起別人循非法手段改變合法制度、慫使他人不守法。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎自稱香港人-遭官質問你是黃皮膚嗎&quot;&gt;黎自稱香港人 遭官質問：「你是黃皮膚嗎？」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰引述黎在節目中稱：「我們只想擺脫獨裁政權，而我們可以在一個我們愛的國家裡，做一個自由的人」，問黎口中的「獨裁政權」是指什麼。黎認為是中共。控方問黎想擺脫中共嗎？黎則稱：「我們不能擺脫中共。」控方追問，黎剛才又說想擺脫獨裁政權，而中共是獨裁政權之一？黎認同他想擺脫獨裁，而中共是獨裁，但他們不能擺脫中共。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎意圖擺脫中共。黎重申：「我的意圖是擺脫獨裁政權」，但因為他是香港人，而香港與中國沒有任何關係。黎又稱只有中國人才能擺脫中共，「但我們是香港人」，並且強調他相信一國兩制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官隨即指出：「我們是中國人。」黎稱：「我們是香港人。」杜官問：「黎先生，你是黃皮膚嗎？」黎稱：「是的，我是黃皮膚，是否因為我是黃皮膚，所以你便將我歸類為中國人？但我是香港人。」杜官反駁：「你是中國人。」黎稱：「我是香港人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提及黎早前供稱反對港獨；黎回應：「是，但是我同意一國兩制。」李官最後表示對於黎的回答感到疑惑，並認為控方沒有需要就此深究下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英質疑控方提問 官籲勿發表「自作聰明的言論」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0cA8U1e.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（25日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第138日審訊，黎智英第46日作供。控方繼續盤問，圍繞國安法生效之後，《蘋果》刊登過的評論文章。其中旅美作家「一劍飄塵」撰寫的〈槍桿下何來安居樂業？〉，提及因應《國安法》實施，「美國肯定會報復直至取消香港自治待遇」，控方質疑黎知悉文章激使讀者循非法手段改變香港依法制定的制度，黎反問：「我怎樣知道？從哪裡可以看到？我正在好奇，請告訴我，因為你是這樣的聰明⋯⋯」法官李素蘭打斷，籲黎：「請不要發表這些自作聰明的言論，你沒有需要去爭辯。」法官李運騰籲黎若不同意的話便回答「不同意」，「我們有數以百計的文章要處理，如果你繼續這樣的話，直至明年我們也會在這裡。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;一劍飄塵文章稱美國會取消香港自治待遇&quot;&gt;「一劍飄塵」文章稱美國會取消香港自治待遇&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;昨日下午，黎在法庭內、在法官不在席之下，檢視133篇非由他撰寫的涉案文章，並紀錄是否曾經閱讀過該些文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行今向黎出示旅美作家「一劍飄塵」的文章〈槍桿下何來安居樂業？〉，在《國安法》生效之後，即2020年7月4日刊登。黎庭上稱記憶中曾經閱讀過上文，但與作者想法不一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否認為這是一篇好文章？黎認同這是一篇好文章，但是他不一定與作者有相同想法。控方追問黎不同意哪一部份？黎則稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述文章：「首先國安法的操作方式完全違背了一國兩制，屬於中共強硬干涉香港立法，已經引起美國強烈反彈。為幫助香港人民，美國早前出台了《香港人權與民主法案》，每年審核香港自治地位。但中共不僅不收斂，反而強行通過國安法，完全侵犯了香港立法權，昭告天下香港已無力自治。在目前中美對抗大環境下，等於是對美國一次小規模偷襲珍珠港，美國肯定會報復直至取消香港自治待遇。香港還能保留國際金融中心地位嗎？失去這個地位，香港連深圳都不如。深圳好歹還有內地眾多廉價勞動力支撐。香港到哪裏找？」控方問黎是否同意？黎稱不完全同意，因為不明白作者提及「珍珠港」的意思。控方質疑，早前庭上已觀看過「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段，黎曾在節目中以日本偷襲珍珠港為比喻。黎回應這文章是不同的語境。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問，黎不是認為這是一篇好文章嗎？黎回應文章是好，但不是所有部份都好。黎又表示，他認同文章所指香港失去國際金融中心地位。控方問，那麼黎是否同意「美國肯定會報復直至取消香港自治待遇」？黎則表示，不認為美國會以「報復」的形式，因「報復」意味美國曾被傷害，但是美國未有被傷害，故沒有需要「報復」。不過，他認為美國會因為《國安法》而改變香港地位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否同意美國實施上文所提及的措施？黎則稱文章沒有提及「措施」，他只是說美國會改變對香港的待遇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎質疑從文章看不出煽動意圖-官籲黎不要發表自作聰明的言論&quot;&gt;黎質疑從文章看不出煽動意圖 官籲黎不要發表「自作聰明的言論」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「香港還能保留國際金融中心地位嗎？失去這個地位，香港連深圳都不如」這一句，控方問黎是否認同。黎則稱他對深圳理解不足，因此說不到是否同意「香港連深圳都不如」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，當黎閱讀上述文章的時候，是知道作者鼓吹針對特區和中央政府實施反制措施。黎不同意。控方續指，黎亦知道作者有意圖引起對政府的憎恨。黎失笑稱：「這是別人撰寫的文章，我怎樣知道他的想法？這是在他的心中」，又稱：「真是很神奇！」控方追問黎即是同意還是不同意？黎稱：「當然我不同意，我怎樣知道？我不能這樣深入地知道作者的想法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎知悉文章激使讀者循非法手段改變香港依法制定的制度。黎聽罷反問：「我怎樣知道？從哪裡可以看到？我正在好奇，請告訴我，因為你是這樣的聰明⋯⋯」此時法官李素蘭打斷，籲黎不要作出這樣的言論，「請不要發表這些自作聰明的言論，你沒有需要去爭辯。」法官李運騰亦指，如果黎不同意的話便回答「不同意」，「我們有過百篇的文章要處理，如果你繼續這樣的話，直至明年我們也會在這裡。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎知悉文章引起讀者對政府不滿和蔑視、引起對司法機關的不滿，以及慫使他人不守法。黎一概不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，文章觸及制裁話題，質疑黎未有提醒前論壇版主管楊清奇，要求作者不要撰寫制裁。黎則否認，堅稱從文章看不到「制裁」字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱未曾閱讀一劍飄塵另一文章-拒答認同作者觀點與否&quot;&gt;黎稱未曾閱讀「一劍飄塵」另一文章 拒答認同作者觀點與否&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示「一劍飄塵」另一篇文章〈美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎？〉，在2020年7月18日刊登於《蘋果》。黎稱沒有閱讀過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述文章：「在我看來，《香港自治法案》就是專門對付林鄭之類香港官員的。因為這個法案對中國官員影響有限，即使他們遭受制裁，也可以繼續在大陸為非作歹，甚至可能因為這種制裁反而仕途高升。」控方問黎是否認同？黎稱現在才閱讀這文章，他未有想過是否認同，又稱不知道作者是基於什麼事實。控方追問，黎想上述段落所述情況發生嗎？黎反問：「如果我沒有想過，那我怎樣可以想它發生？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章稱：「一旦被美國政府制裁，全世界銀行都得服從，除非它們從此再不用美元做交易，也不想在美國壟斷性金融市場裏分一杯羹。這是絕大多數銀行都承受不了的。所以，一旦被制裁，就只能扛著現鈔過日子了。當然，對於香港官員和警察來說，也算名副其實：黑幫不都是現金結算麽？」控方問黎是否認同作者？黎堅稱這段落只是陳述當時情況，不存在他認同或不認同的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章稱：「香港作為國際三大著名金融中心之一，在遭受中共及林鄭月娥之流邪惡摧殘的今天，如果被美國實施金融制裁，讓邪惡受到懲罰，算不算惡有惡報呢？」控方問黎是否認同？黎重申他理解文章只是描述狀況，不存在認同與否的問題。控方質疑，黎一直以來不是提倡對中港實施制裁及敵對行動嗎？黎否認是「一直以來」，又稱沒有提倡過敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎確認未有要求將文章下架-惟否認知悉文章煽動&quot;&gt;黎確認未有要求將文章下架 惟否認知悉文章煽動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，作者是否利用《蘋果》作為平台，去提倡他的觀點？黎則稱很多人均利用《蘋果》這個平台發表文章，但不代表他要認同所有作者的觀點。控方問：「你容許這事情發生？」黎重申，他不需要認同所有作者的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎有否要求楊清奇不要再刊登這類文章？黎稱沒有，因不認為有需要。黎亦確認，他沒有向時任總編輯羅偉光和時任英文版主筆馮偉光作出同樣要求。控方又問，黎未有要求將文章下架？黎回答沒有，一般而言他不會處理編採事務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎當時知悉上述文章呼籲外國針對中港政府實施制裁和敵對措施、引起對政府憎恨、激使他人循非法手段改變香港依法制定的制度，以及慫使他人不守法。黎一概否認，並反問：「這是別人撰寫的文章，你為什麼要問？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方李怡專欄文章呼籲制裁-黎不同意&quot;&gt;控方：李怡專欄文章呼籲制裁 黎不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示已故作家李怡於2020年10月28日的專欄文章〈世道人生：警惕左翼思潮〉。當中談及美國大選：「拜登自信一定當選，醜聞毋須回應。」文章引述拜登在電視辯論中稱若然當選的話，「我會要求中國遵守國際規則，不像他（特朗普）大打貿易戰」。文章稱：「這是最令人恐怖的一句話！這意味着他會一如既往不斷要求中國遵守各項國際規則，而不會如貿易戰那樣對不守規則者作任何懲罰，不會制裁侵犯人權、違反國際承諾的中港官員，不會對受迫害者伸出援手。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，作者似乎提倡美國要制裁侵犯人權的中港官員，希望拜登不只要求中國遵守國際規則，而是可以好像特朗普般，對不守規則者實施懲罰措施。黎反問：「從哪裡可以找到？」，堅稱作者是指拜登不像特朗普，又指拜登不會制裁中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則指，文章是在呼籲制裁、引起憎恨、激使他人以非法手段改變依法制定的制度，以及慫使他人不守法。黎一概稱不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另外向黎出示英文版評論文章，分別為英國記者兼作家 Michael Cox 撰寫的〈Time for UK to bring HSBC to heel〉及鄺頌晴（Glacier Kwong）撰寫的〈Why people reckon upon Germany speaking up against human rights violations〉。黎稱不認識兩名作者。&lt;/p&gt;

Continued support for semiconductor design is vital for national security and global competitiveness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. semiconductor design industry is a critically important strategic asset. It enables technological leadership in defense systems and fosters competitive advantage in manufacturing industries such as computing, telecommunications, autonomous vehicles, and medical devices. Design accounts for over 50 percent of total value added in the production of semiconductors—more than any other activity associated with the production process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. designers are the global leaders in every major segment of the industry, not just among leading-edge fabless firms. It is unsurprising, then, that the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022—which was designed to respond to major shortcomings in the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem—does not devote much attention to design, focusing instead on chip manufacturing, manufacturing equipment, and packaging. However, reflecting its importance, the U.S. design industry faces a growing challenge from Chinese firms, which, backed with state support, are gaining global market share at the expense of U.S. designers. The recent release of the Chinese artificial intelligence DeepSeek app, which rattled Silicon Valley and financial markets, demonstrates the speed at which assumptions of U.S. technological leadership can be upended by China’s rapidly growing innovation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, this reflects the impact of U.S. export controls. While these controls have disrupted the operations of Chinese chip design firms over the short run, their imposition has catalyzed an unprecedented state-backed effort to promote the self-sufficiency and international competitiveness of China’s design sector. This pushback by Chinese companies against Western sanctions has already produced startling achievements, most notably Huawei’s 2023 introduction of the Kirin 9000S system-on-a-chip (SoC) manufactured on a 7 nanometer (nm) process for use in its Mate 60 Pro smartphone—a feat which, to the surprise of U.S. policymakers, occurred much sooner than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the strategic and economic importance of maintaining U.S. chip design leadership along with China’s determination to challenge it, U.S. policy deliberations over a possible “CHIPS Act 2.0” need to recognize the critical contributions of this industry. Ultimately, the United States will need to implement a range of policy measures to support continued U.S. leadership in design as well as in manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chip-design-and-national-security&quot;&gt;Chip Design and National Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes are genuinely important. U.S. semiconductor design leadership means that U.S.-designed chips are superior to those from all other countries in terms of performance, sophistication, energy efficiency, and security—representing enormous strategic leverage. Moreover, because these chips are incorporated into virtually all U.S. defense platforms, the quality and reliability of the chips embedded in U.S. systems play a key role in battlefield performance, information acquisition, and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offshoring of U.S. chip manufacturing capability means that the most advanced U.S. designs are fabricated outside the United States, concentrated primarily on the island of Taiwan. This represents a significant strategic vulnerability for the United States, one that is at least beginning to be addressed. Yet a much greater vulnerability would emerge if the United States’ ability to create the most sophisticated and mission-specific chips were to be eclipsed by that of a strategic adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security:&lt;/strong&gt; If an adversary could design and deploy chips more advanced than those in use by the United States, it could win a commanding advantage in every aspect of military preparedness, up to and including a major conflict. Should segments of the U.S. economy and defense industrial base ever find it necessary to utilize chips designed in China (or another adversarial state) because those chips were not available from domestic or friendly sources, then the United States’ defense posture, cybersecurity, and counterintelligence operations could be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If an adversary could design and deploy chips more advanced than those in use by the United States, it could win a commanding advantage in every aspect of military preparedness, up to and including a major conflict.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial Intelligence:&lt;/strong&gt; Nowhere is the need for continued U.S. design leadership more apparent than in artificial intelligence, particularly with regard to the AI systems expected to determine both economic advantage and battlefield capabilities in the twenty-first century. Today, most leading-edge AI chips are designed by Nvidia, with other sophisticated U.S. design firms such as AMD making major advances. It is therefore no coincidence that recently tightened U.S. export controls have restricted not only the export of chip design software to “countries of concern” but also specific U.S.-designed chips with advanced AI applications. To counter these restrictions, China is mounting well-funded efforts to improve its design capability for the chips needed to support AI. The 2025 release of the DeepSeek app is an indicator that these efforts represent a serious and multifaceted challenge—as one Chinese observer put it, “we should have confidence that China will eventually win the AI war with the US.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cybersecurity:&lt;/strong&gt; Chip design is also at the forefront of the ongoing struggle to ensure cybersecurity and to thwart hacking and tampering efforts, to which a number of “countries of concern” are reportedly devoting unprecedented resources. In a virtuous cycle, design leadership would improve the ability to protect design information and to trace and control design intellectual property (IP). Designing security into chips is becoming a multifaceted and complex challenge—as one engineer at one of the world’s leading fabless firms (Xilinx, which was subsequently acquired by AMD) observed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have to be able to encrypt the data coming in and encrypt the data going out. We may be able to reprogram your device and make sure that it’s coming from an authenticated source. And finally, we need to protect the IP that’s inside this device through cryptography and IP threat protection, with DPA (differential power analysis) resistance and things like that. All the security features that exist in our high-end devices need to be available in a low-cost FPGA [field programmable gate array].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Manufacturing Caveat:&lt;/strong&gt; It is of course true that, at the leading edge of the chip industry, the sophistication of chip design must be paired with equivalently sophisticated manufacturing capability, capacity, and equipment, and as such, access to manufacturing capability and capacity must also be considered in assessing the security threat of an adversary’s chip design industry. China’s Huawei, for example, may design highly advanced chips, but its ability to manufacture such a chip at scale appears severely constrained, as China’s most advanced foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), is still generations behind the leading edge in both its processes and the equipment it deploys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this dynamic, Huawei and SMIC have proven to be a formidable partnership, reportedly stretching older-generation equipment to manufacture a chip at the 5 nm process, albeit with tremendous inefficiencies and at great cost. It is important to note that this is a capability that even the United States will lack until the various leading-edge CHIPS projects across the country begin high-volume production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, and perhaps most importantly, the design industry is far more diverse an ecosystem than just the leading edge. In many categories of semiconductors not defined by the density of their components, Chinese firms have the design talent, manufacturing capacity, scale, and resources to compete effectively with Western firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chips-act-largely-aimed-at-manufacturing&quot;&gt;CHIPS Act Largely Aimed at Manufacturing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo spoke at CSIS to provide an update on the U.S. government’s implementation of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (widely referred to as the “CHIPS Act”). This strongly bipartisan legislation was enacted primarily to address gaps and vulnerabilities in the country’s supply chain for semiconductors, most notably the absence of manufacturing capacity on U.S. soil for the most advanced chips as well as limited manufacturing capability for “foundational” chips with applications in the automotive, telecommunications, defense electronics, and other manufacturing sectors essential to the U.S. economy. The CHIPS Act authorizes and appropriates $39 billion in federal funding to encourage semiconductor manufacturing on U.S. soil, with an additional $12 billion allocated for various research initiatives such as the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) metrology research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her address to CSIS, Secretary Raimondo underscored the advantages associated with the U.S. edge in chip design in the country’s overall competition with China in microelectronics. While the secretary was right to celebrate the strengths of the U.S. design industry, the existing CHIPS Act does not address the needs of U.S. chip designers in this increasingly competitive segment of the industry. The 400-page act is principally concerned with arresting the erosion of the domestic U.S. chip manufacturing base. To do so, it provides direct grants to support both foreign and domestic manufacturing firms in the United States. Although the act also includes a 25 percent tax credit for investments in chip manufacturing, a benefit estimated at $46 billion by the Congressional Budget Office (but one that may considerably exceed that amount), it only indirectly addresses chip design. U.S. chip design firms are not eligible for the direct federal funding authorized by the act or for the 25 percent tax credit; the federal funding is being directed toward manufacturers and their upstream equipment and materials suppliers only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, for chip design, there is only a relatively small and indirect amount of funding being allocated. NIST has released a vision for the NSTC that spells out, among many other initiatives, a plan for a “design enablement gateway” intended to “facilitate collaboration, reduce cost and time to market, and broaden access to important tools and information, all while respecting private companies’ IP.” The Department of Commerce CHIPS Office plans to allocate $5 billion to support the NSTC, operated by the National Center for the Advancement of Semiconductor Technology (Natcast), as well as other R&amp;amp;D and workforce initiatives. The portion of this outlay that will be allocated to chip design is comparatively modest relative to the resources going to chip manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to question the wisdom of the CHIPS Act’s focus on manufacturing. The act was intended to address emerging and existing gaps and vulnerabilities in the U.S. chip supply chain that pose immediate risks to national security and future economic well-being. These immediate vulnerabilities are in the manufacturing and packaging of advanced chips. The design sector is not a “gap” or “vulnerability” in the U.S. chip supply chain—on the contrary, the United States is far and away the world leader in innovative ability, market share, and international competitiveness in this crucial sector. The sector is thus not an obvious candidate for public policy initiatives intended to mend holes in the U.S. industrial fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, viewed in a global competitive context and looking beyond the immediate challenges in chip manufacturing, the question of government support comes to the fore. As noted, design is the most valuable element in the entire chip production chain, and for that reason, China is supporting efforts by Chinese firms to challenge U.S. design leadership. The relative levels of public support combined with the absence of market discipline and growth in the Chinese talent base pose significant challenges to the U.S. industry’s ability to sustain its strong global position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-chip-design-landscape-today&quot;&gt;The Chip Design Landscape Today&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-us-global-dominance-in-design&quot;&gt;Current U.S. Global Dominance in Design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. semiconductor design industry is the strongest in the world, it is important to recognize that it is heterogeneous, consisting of five main types of companies. In each of these subsectors, U.S. firms enjoy a strong global competitive position, at least for now. According to a 2022 study by the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group (henceforth the “SIA/BCG study”), 50.2 percent of global semiconductor revenues in 2023 were derived from the design activities of U.S.-based firms—2.5 times as much as from any other region. With respect to logic devices, U.S.-based design activities accounted for 65 percent of global revenues in 2022. These revenues, and companies’ willingness to draw from them to invest massively in R&amp;amp;D, are essential to maintaining the U.S. lead across a range of technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs):&lt;/strong&gt; IDMs are vertically integrated entities that both design and manufacture semiconductors. Major U.S.-based IDMs include Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, and Texas Instruments. Intel is currently forecasting that its design effort will progress dramatically—by five chip nodes in four years—entering what it calls the “Angstrom Era.” While currently facing some turbulence, Intel’s stated goal is to incorporate 1 trillion transistors in a single processor package by 2030, about 10 times the current number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fabless Firms:&lt;/strong&gt; Fabless firms focus exclusively on semiconductor design, outsourcing the production of chips based on their designs to foundries that specialize in manufacturing, thereby avoiding the enormous capital costs associated with the most advanced manufacturing. This enables these firms to concentrate on chip design—and, more importantly, to concentrate their substantial R&amp;amp;D expenditures only on chip design. By comparison, IDMs must invest major sums in both design R&amp;amp;D and the capital outlays needed to build the fabs and the assembly, test, and packaging facilities that fabricate the chips they design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic advantages of being fabless are compelling. Seven of the world’s top ten fabless firms by revenue are U.S. companies, including Nvidia, Qualcomm, and AMD. In addition, five of the world’s top ten global firms in 2023 by annual revenue were fabless firms. Finally, from a U.S. semiconductor industry point of view, five of the U.S. industry’s top six companies by annual revenue in 2023 were fabless firms. The U.S. semiconductor industry has largely embraced the fabless business model and its avoidance of the heavy capital costs of production. The United States is the current global fabless leader, an important factor underlying the U.S. industry’s global leadership in chip design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, U.S. strengths in design now underpin the growth in AI. Artificial intelligence chips designed by Nvidia account for over 80 percent of the market for advanced AI chips and “underpin all of the most advanced AI systems.” Nvidia is one of the United States’ five most valuable firms, with a market valuation of over $3 trillion as of July 2024. A central goal of the CHIPS Act was to ensure that at least some of these advanced chips could be manufactured in fabs within U.S. borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs):&lt;/strong&gt; OEMs use semiconductors in other products they make, such as smartphones and automobiles. In recent years, OEMs have begun designing advanced chips tailored for use in their own end products, and U.S.-based OEMs have enjoyed dramatic successes designing custom chips. Apple, for example, designed its own “Apple silicon” series processors, first for its smartphones and tablets, then replacing Intel-designed and fabricated chips for its PCs in 2020—reaping “huge benefits,” particularly via increased PC market share. Other major U.S. OEM chip designers include Amazon and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Design Automation (EDA) Firms:&lt;/strong&gt; EDA firms provide automated design tools and many types of services to chip designers. While not chip designers themselves, their software is indispensable for the design of advanced semiconductor devices. The world’s three leading EDA software firms—Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems, and Mentor Graphics—are located in the United States; Mentor Graphics is owned by the German firm Siemens but operates in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual Property (IP) Providers:&lt;/strong&gt; IP providers license intellectual property that can be used as building blocks for new designs, avoiding the cost and added time of developing an entirely new design from scratch. Many firms license IP as a source of revenue, but in 2021, U.S.-based firms accounted for the largest share (72 percent) of revenues from EDA and IP blocks, with Europe accounting for most of the rest (20 percent). The leading European firm in this space is UK-based Arm Holdings, which licenses processor cores to design companies. As of 2020, Arm cores drove 90 percent of mobile phone applications worldwide and 34 percent of the entire semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;clouds-on-the-horizon&quot;&gt;Clouds on the Horizon?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the dominant position of the U.S. chip design industry, one could fairly ask: What is the problem? Recent projections of an eroding global market share have not materialized. The 2022 SIA/BCG study, which warned that U.S. market share fell from 50 percent in 2000 to 46 percent in 2020, forecast that it would fall further to 36 percent by 2030, reflecting the emergence of the Chinese chip design industry (which accounted for almost zero percent of the global market in 2000, rose to 9 percent in 2020, and was forecast to hit 23 percent in 2030). To be sure, the most recent data available, from 2023, shows the U.S. share recovering to 50.2 percent by 2030, reflecting recent market successes of U.S.-designed AI- drive server chips. However, the advent of China’s DeepSeek AI app, developed despite U.S. export controls on AI chip technology, suggests that the 50.2 percent figure may be overly sanguine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, figures depicting only total global market shares mask trends in submarkets that concern industry observers. The gross numbers in the SIA/BCG study and in more recent surveys do not reflect the fact that U.S. chip design firms are not the market leaders in every semiconductor design product subsegment, nor do they show that in some areas, U.S. designers face growing challenges from China. According to the SIA/BCG study, in 2021, U.S. firms held an overwhelming share of submarkets for advanced processors (88 percent) and analog devices (58 percent) and maintained the leading share in other logic devices (31 percent, versus 28 percent for Europe). Still, in other important categories U.S. firms trail the market leaders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optoelectronics:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2021, U.S. design firms accounted for only 13 percent of the optoelectronics market, versus 35 percent for Japan, 15 percent for China, and 15 percent for Korea. In 2023, the Chinese Academy of Engineering designated optoelectronic semiconductors as one of 14 “challenges it wants to crack.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2021, U.S. firms accounted for 28 percent of the memory market versus 57 percent for Korea. But in late 2023, China’s leading DRAM developer, ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), unveiled a concept design featuring gate-all-around (GAA) transistor architecture, which is equivalent to global state-of-the-art memory designs. This shows significant Chinese progress in design, although CXMT’s timeline and capacity for manufacturing such a chip remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Optical Sensors:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2021, U.S. firms held an 18 percent share of the market for non-optical sensors, versus 31 percent for Europe and 22 percent for Japan. China’s 2021 Three-Year Action Plan for the Internet of Things calls for targeted support for temperature, gas, motion, photoelectric, velocity, and biochemical sensors (e.g., non-optical sensors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discrete Devices:&lt;/strong&gt; Discrete devices are chips with only one transistor. Although not technologically sophisticated, these have ubiquitous applications and represent a supply chain risk if not available in adequate quantities to U.S. manufacturers. In 2021, U.S. firms held a 27 percent share of the market for discrete devices, versus 36 percent for Europe and 26 percent for Japan. According to one source, China attained self-sufficiency in discrete chips in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Next Generation of Design Engineers:&lt;/strong&gt; Even in EDA tools, where U.S. firms hold an apparently insurmountable edge over China, Chinese observers see a long-range opportunity for their country. One commented in 2019 that “if you look at the main [U.S.] companies in this software market segment, the average age of many [of their EDA engineers] is like 50 years old now. So, this is an opportunity for China to invest [in talent and other resources to support EDA research and development],” especially since academic researchers in the United States are not getting enough funding to pursue further EDA development. “So, these professors and a lot of engineers have moved on to do something else.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-need-for-a-long-term-well-financed-effort-on-talent&quot;&gt;The Need for a Long-Term, Well-Financed Effort on Talent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above comment highlights the importance of a long-term view of a nation’s talent base and support for the research that will underpin future private investments. The U.S. Chips for America Strategy, which outlines the planned implementation of the U.S. CHIPS Act, acknowledges that at present, “there is a severe shortage of workers who are trained and ready to fill new roles in specialized construction, fab operations, and semiconductor design,” and forecasts that as much as $8 billion will be required to expand the existing worker base. In chip design, initiatives are needed to scale up the existing workforce and create pathways through community colleges and four-year institutions to feed students into the design pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that China is and will remain the United States’ principal strategic competitor, a key question for U.S. policymakers is whether the recent strides of China’s chip design sector represent a competitive and strategic challenge to the United States. Clearly, they do. A 2023 study by the European research consortium Digital Power China posed the same question from a European perspective and concluded that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The growing competitiveness of Chinese chip design companies has so far been neglected by policymakers in Europe. Despite the recent U.S. export controls targeting China’s semiconductor industry, it is highly likely that Chinese chip design companies will gain global market share in a range of industry sectors in this decade. This presents challenges across the dimensions of national security, supply chain resilience, and technological competitiveness for Europe, its end-customer industries and semiconductor companies. Importantly, most of these challenges are not addressed by the proposed European Chips Act and will require different and tailored policy responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the same could be said of the U.S. CHIPS Act. The challenges the report describes in security and competitiveness for Europe are clearly the United States’ challenges as well. To address them, U.S. policymakers need to break away from the constraints of outmoded views on global trade and industrial policy and instead address the reality and effectiveness of the state-backed enterprises focused on challenging the U.S. design industry. Tailored measures to support U.S. design firms are necessary in the face of this unprecedented Chinese national effort to displace them. Both serious resources and adaptive policies will be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s share of the global chip design market grew from virtually zero in 2003 to 7 percent in 2023. While these growth figures are impressive for a new entrant, they do not suggest a serious threat to U.S. global leadership in the near term. However, one must recognize the long-term challenge represented by the Chinese government’s determination to transform the country’s design sector into a global competitive leader and a pillar of China’s national defense posture, as well as the magnitude of government resources being committed to that effort. Although China’s chip designers have been set back by Western sanctions, it is likely that sustained governmental support at scale and the growing quality of Chinese research and engineers complemented by the large domestic market will enable the nation’s design sector to continue to expand its global market share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;massive-government-support&quot;&gt;Massive Government Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In global competition for high-tech industry, there is arguably no parallel for the sheer scale of China’s commitment of public resources to the semiconductor industry. In 2014, the State Council released the National Guideline for the Development and Promotion of the Integrated Circuit Industry (“National IC Plan”), setting forth a long-range plan to promote the domestic semiconductor industry. Concurrently, it established the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (also known as “the Big Fund”) to undertake investments in the semiconductor industry, combining government, private, and public-private funds. Wenwu Ding, the president of the Big Fund, said that the plan was to make $100 billion dollars available to the semiconductor ecosystem from central, regional, and local governments and public/private investment vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In global competition for high-tech industry, there is arguably no parallel for the sheer scale of China’s commitment of public resources to the semiconductor industry&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These measures were followed in 2015 by the State Council’s release of Made in China 2025, a ten-year plan for promoting national manufacturing industries—particularly “core development sectors” such as semiconductors, which were to be promoted for “breakthrough development.” At the end of 2022, China was reportedly planning to spend an astonishing $143 billion over the next five years to promote the domestic semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese National IC Plan emphasizes the importance of semiconductor design. A 2024 joint study by the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group found that in the first two rounds of funding from the Big Fund, Chinese fabless design companies received billions of dollars in public funding. In 2024, the Chinese government announced a third phase of the Big Fund, with registered capital of $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to calculate with precision the total amount of Chinese government funding directed to chip design; in addition to fabless firms, the first two rounds of investment from the Big Fund directed over $10 billion to IDMs, which included but was not limited to design activities. These firms, which include Huawei, Tencent, Xiaomi, and Alibaba, have developed robust internal chip design capabilities—usually through subsidiaries—that have surprised Western analysts. In addition, regional and municipal governments, particularly those of Shanghai and Shenzhen, have provided strong direct support to China’s chip design firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the government’s support for the chip design industry, venture capital has poured into the design sector. In 2020, 67.2 percent of venture capital investments in the Chinese semiconductor industry were in IC design. In addition, China exempts key design firms from corporate income tax for five years after their first profitable year and taxes at a reduced rate of 10 percent thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s demonstration of support for the semiconductor design sector has fostered a “gold rush” of start-ups in the design space, in which barriers to entry are relatively low, particularly when compared to manufacturing. According to one report, as of September 2020 there was an astounding total of 138,000 semiconductor design start-ups in China, most of them registered after the formation of the Big Fund in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken on its own, a vast landscape of firms responding to abundant funding does not indicate success. Huge numbers of these firms have failed and will continue to fail. In the summer of 2024, for instance, the promising start-up X-Epic, a developer of indigenous EDA software, reportedly slashed its 400-person workforce by half, “casting a shadow over Beijing’s efforts to achieve tech self-sufficiency,” in one observer’s view. X-Epic’s predicament is representative of the broader asphyxiation of China’s start-up ecosystem since the pandemic. According to the Financial Times, China’s start-up launches in 2024 totaled just 260, down from a peak of over 50,000 in 2018. “The whole industry has just died before our eyes,” one Chinese executive lamented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the downturn, there has been some success with a few key players emerging, including Loongson Technology, a designer of general-purpose microprocessors; Black Sesame, a designer of low-power automotive chips; Biren Technologies, a designer of general-purpose GPUs; and Horizon Robotics, a designer of autonomous driving computing chips. Nor has the ecosystem died. At present, there are over 3,000 fabless design firms in China, collectively with double-digit annual growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-impact-of-western-export-controls&quot;&gt;The Impact of Western Export Controls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the growing geopolitical threat posed by China’s increased capabilities in this industry, the United States and some allies began curtailing the export of semiconductor technology to China in 2019, when the Trump administration placed Huawei and 68 of its non-U.S. affiliates on the Entity List—effectively barring them from using U.S. chip technology and software, including all U.S. EDA tools, when their licenses expired. At the time it was believed that “without American EDA tools, it would be basically impossible for Huawei to design chips.” Since then, the Biden administration has further tightened controls on exports of U.S. chips, chip technology, and chip design and manufacturing tools. In 2022, it announced multilateral controls on the export of certain EDA tools that can be used to design gate-all-around field effect transistor (GAAFET) architecture, currently the most advanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western sanctions dealt a serious blow to China’s chip designers, which could, until 2022, rely on U.S. EDA design tools and IP. Reflecting the apparent ease of accessing foreign technology, relatively little had been done to develop domestic EDA capability or ownership of IP: “So long as indigenous firms could tap the best of what the world had to offer, local investors had low economic incentives to reinvent the wheel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to losing access to the most advanced chip design tools, Chinese chip designers experienced diminished access to foreign foundries, particularly TSMC, which had formerly fabricated their most advanced designs. By curtailing its services for Chinese designers in response to Western export controls, TSMC dealt a blow to HiSilicon, Huawei’s design subsidiary, and Zeku, the chip design subsidiary of Chinese smartphone maker Oppo, causing Zeku to shut its doors. Two top Chinese designers of AI chips, MetaX and Enflame, have reportedly submitted downgraded versions of their designs to TSMC to comply with U.S. restrictions. The two firms had previously marketed their chips as being comparable to Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the Chinese government and chip industry have demonstrated considerable resilience and ingenuity in response to Western sanctions. Although the sanctions have indisputably disrupted China’s semiconductor industry in the near term, the response has been to implement countermeasures which, over the long term, will substantially enhance the competitiveness of the Chinese chip industry and reduce its dependency on foreign technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions are thus having the concerning longer-term effect of incentivizing China to create its own indigenous design tools and encouraging unprecedented support for the industry. In a sense, the sanctions have highlighted the structural advantage of Chinese firms. They do not have to have better technology, much less be profitable; they only have to capture market share, allowing them to move down the cost curve and up the learning curve while reducing Western competitors’ revenue—and therefore their resources to invest in the next generations of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;huaweis-central-role&quot;&gt;Huawei’s Central Role&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s dominant telecommunications equipment maker, Huawei, is also the country’s largest consumer of semiconductors and its leading chip designer, primarily through its design subsidiary, HiSilicon. According to a widely cited Bloomberg report, the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei in 2019 induced the Chinese government to turn to the company as “the effective captain of China’s effort to develop a self-sufficient chip industry . . . In Huawei they have a rare national champion with the grit, scale and technological prowess to push back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei overhauled its operations to redesign its equipment and software so they could function without U.S. technology. Huawei’s current-generation smartphone, the Pura 70 line, incorporates 33 China-sourced components and only 5 sourced from outside China. At the same time, Huawei began to provide engineering expertise and financial support to smaller companies in key parts of the semiconductor supply chain. HiSilicon, the largest chip design company in China, is best known for its development of all the chips for Huawei’s smartphones and tablets, most notably the Kirin range. One of its recent chips was recently shown to outperform Nvidia’s flagship V100 device in some respects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Huawei’s efforts, a number of China’s big data equipment manufacturers are stepping up their efforts to promote advances in domestic chip design, including Baidu, Tencent, Xiaomi, and Alibaba. These firms bring substantial resources and proven track records and may well offer a path to a more robust domestic industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-challenge-of-indigenous-eda-tools&quot;&gt;The Challenge of Indigenous EDA Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2023, EDA tool firms Cadence, Synopsys, and Siemens EDA controlled 80 percent of China’s market. U.S. export controls have compelled these firms to curtail some China sales—including, significantly, EDA software containing GAAFET technology, which is needed to support the design of AI chips. Although China has little to no prospect of developing its own advanced EDA tools in the near future, U.S. leadership should not be taken for granted over the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-policy-neglect-to-focus&quot;&gt;From Policy Neglect to Focus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDA was neglected by Chinese government policymakers until the advent of sanctions. As one industry observer noted: “For the longest time, Chinese industrial policymakers didn’t realize [EDA software] is the real bottleneck.” Somewhat belatedly, China’s current Five-Year Plan now lists EDA as the “first cutting-edge technology in the semiconductor industry where China needs to make breakthroughs.” Reflecting this change in orientation, domestic EDA developers are receiving substantially increased government financial support and have made some early gains. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, the municipal government of Shanghai said it would subsidize 30 percent of the cost of chip software investments such as EDA tools.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same year, the municipal government of Shenzhen committed to providing a subsidy of up to $1.4 million to companies that buy “home-grown” EDA tools.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A number of executives from U.S. EDA firms have left to join Chinese rivals “as Beijing seeks to break America’s near monopoly on this key segment of the semiconductor industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s leading EDA developer, Empyrean Technology, experienced a sixfold increase in revenues between 2018 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In April 2024, the Chinese firm Xinhuazhang introduced its first EDA design software that can work on domestically made processors (Huawei’s Kunpeng processors and Phytium’s Feiteng devices). As observed by one industry expert, “this is a significant development for China’s semiconductor industry as domestic chip designers can now design devices and simulate them using solely domestic software and hardware.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevantly for the long-term effectiveness of Western sanctions, EDA tools are software, which are more difficult for Western allies to control than hardware like lithography equipment. A recent article in the MIT Technology Review notes that “EDA software tools are distributed online, so they can be pirated. Chinese companies could either hold onto the EDA software they have already purchased or resort to hacking licenses or acquiring them through shadow entities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese firms are seeking to acquire Western companies with EDA competencies—in 2022, the United Kingdom rejected a bid by a Shanghai software developer to take over Pulsic Limited, a developer of chip design software. One analyst suggests that Chinese design firms can continue to acquire EDA tools by setting up shell companies with no apparent connection to firms on the Entity List as a legal front for acquiring EDA licenses, perhaps in collaboration with foreign EDA vendors. And in April 2022, the U.S. EDA supplier Synopsys was reportedly under investigation by the Department of Commerce for allegedly sharing its design software with HiSilicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-risc-v-challenge&quot;&gt;The RISC-V Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government is encouraging domestic chip designers to utilize RISC-V reduced instruction set architecture for custom processors as an alternative to licensing IP blocks from Western firms such as Intel and Arm. RISC-V is an open-source architecture managed by a Swiss foundation that allows semiconductor design teams to access and implement RISC-V standard free of charge. It is not subject to U.S. and allied export controls, and Chinese entities including Alibaba, Huawei, ZTE, and Tencent are active participants in the RISC-V foundation. Members of the U.S. Congress recently warned that China might use RISC-V to circumvent U.S. export controls on general computing processors, should the United States decide to adopt them in the future. In April 2024, the Department of Commerce said that it was reviewing the national security implications of China’s use of RISC-V technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Beijing Open-Source Chip Research Institute, a group of research centers that includes the Chinese Academy of Sciences and hyper-scalers Tencent and Alibaba, is developing indigenous chip design architecture based on RISC-V. According to the Silicon Triangle report, “if it succeeds, the group’s Xiangshan RISC-V architecture could free China from IP constraints imposed by Arm, the Cambridge-based company whose technology underlies most cell phones, including Apple products.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government incentives are being offered to spur adoption of IP that implements RISC-V in chip designs, and domestic design firms are reporting successes in applying RISC-V architecture. The municipal government of Shanghai was the first to kickstart RISC-V development in 2018, offering specific financial incentives to encourage companies to develop RISC-V processors and related IP. In that year, the city oversaw the formation of the RISC-V Industry Alliance, convening local start-ups in a collaboration that had grown to 173 companies by mid-2023. In 2023, nine leading chip design firms, including Alibaba’s chip unit T-Head and Baidu-backed StarFive, formed a patent alliance for RISC-V to enable IP sharing and third-party licensing to promote a “healthy” open-source environment and the “rapid development of RISC-V technologies.” The municipal government of Shenzhen is providing up to $1.4 million to firms that are working on open standard RISC-V chip design architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These efforts are bearing fruit, with Chinese chip designers reporting successes in applications of RISC-V architecture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In December 2022, a dozen Chinese chip firms launched 11 new RISC-V-based chips with applications in wireless communications, automobiles, security, and energy management.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Alibaba’s chip design subsidiary, T-Head, launched a RISC-V-based controller chip, Zhenyue 510, for applications in artificial intelligence training, online transactions, and big data analysis. A T-Head executive said that his company was launching an initiative to encourage 150,000 developers to learn about and secure international credentials with respect to RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alibaba’s research arm, Damo Academy, announced in 2024 that it expects to launch the next generation of its RISC-V XuanTie processors, the C930, in 2024. The new chip has applications in 5G communications, robotics, and financial services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;upgrading-domestic-foundries-for-independence-from-the-global-network&quot;&gt;Upgrading Domestic Foundries for Independence from the Global Network&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, to reduce its dependence on foreign firms, China is now devoting massive government resources to upgrading its domestic chip foundries—an effort which, if successful, would partially mitigate indigenous designers’ loss of access to TSMC and other Western foundries with respect to the production of high-end designs. Domestic foundries such as SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor are reportedly “actively” increasing capacity, particularly for the production of legacy chips used in current industrial applications. Total Chinese foundry capacity is forecast to grow by 15 percent in 2024 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western sanctions prevent Chinese foundries from utilizing ASML’s most advanced lithography equipment, based on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology, which is needed to make the 2, 3, and 5 nm chips supporting advanced artificial intelligence. An open question is how far Chinese foundries can push their existing chipmaking capabilities to close the gap with Western chip firms. Huawei “shocked the world” in 2023 by unveiling its 7 nm processor in collaboration with the domestic foundry SMIC. As noted earlier, Huawei is reportedly set to launch a smartphone with an SoC manufactured with SMIC’s 5 nm process in October 2024. Whether these chips can be produced cost effectively at scale remains to be seen from a commercial perspective, but it does suggest they might be able to produce chips to meet high-end defense requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-chinese-chip-design-achievements&quot;&gt;Recent Chinese Chip Design Achievements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Chinese chip design sector has been shaken by Western export controls, it is rapidly developing workarounds. An executive at a Chinese EDA firm said in December 2024 that while China “is blocked from advanced processing technologies, both in software and hardware . . . using 3D stacking and heterogenous integration offers a long-term viable solution to bypass sanctions.” The implementation of U.S. export controls has been paralleled by significant Chinese advances in chip design, calling into question the long-term effectiveness of U.S. restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2022:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) releases initial export controls on advanced chip technology and manufacturing equipment to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2022:&lt;/strong&gt; Moore Threads Technology, a U.S.-blacklisted Chinese GPU design firm founded by a former Nvidia executive, is proving adept at quickly developing alternatives to foreign-restricted chips with consumer electronics applications. The company’s MTT S80, introduced in 2022, is being compared favorably by video gamers with Nvidia hardware. Although the MTT S80 does not perform as well as Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3060, it costs about 40 percent less, opening opportunities to capture significant market share and the associated revenues to fund further development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; Tencent announces that despite Western sanctions it is entering mass production of a chip developed in-house, a video transcoding processor called Canghai that will be used to power cloud gaming and video streaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; BIS releases updated controls to close loopholes, expand sanctioned firms, and control additional categories of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; HiSilicon designs the Kirin 9000s, the 7 nm SoC that supports Huawei’s Mate 60 Pro smartphone—a development that startles U.S. officials concerned about the effectiveness of U.S. and allied chip export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) presents a paper at the IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting indicating “its design capabilities for gate-all-around (GAA) transistors—the most advanced transistor type for cutting-edge 3-nanometre grade chips.” CXMT’s presentation “grabbed the attention of industry analysts, as the design of such chips typically involves technologies that are subject to US export restrictions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2024:&lt;/strong&gt; Huawei is reportedly considering incorporation of 5 nm chips designed by SMIC despite U.S. sanctions in upcoming versions of its Mate 70 smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2024:&lt;/strong&gt; ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, is reportedly planning to use TSMC to manufacture two of its 5 nm chip designs to reduce dependency on Nvidia chips. ByteDance denies these reports, stating that all of its chip projects are “in compliance with relevant trade control regulations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2024:&lt;/strong&gt; SenseTime group, a partially government-owned Chinese AI software firm, discloses that it was using “a lot” of domestically produced chips “to train its large language models as part of its efforts to rapidly develop a homegrown AI computing ecosystem.” The company noted, in particular, Huawei’s latest AI accelerator, Ascend910C, which it said offers “a significant performance improvement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2024:&lt;/strong&gt; TSMC reportedly tells multiple Chinese customers that it was suspending production of their AI and high-performance computing chips in order to ensure compliance with U.S. export controls. Similarly, Xiaomi is reportedly “preparing a self-designed mobile processor for its upcoming smartphones in an effort to reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers Qualcomm and MediaTek.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; The Biden administration expands its blacklist of Chinese chip firms, extending it to Chinese suppliers of EDA software, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, specialty gases, and infrastructure firms supporting Huawei’s chip development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States tightens its controls on exports of semiconductors to China, restricting all exports of chips under or at 14 and 16 nm, with transistor counts exceeding 30 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s leading designer of memory chips, YMTC, has reportedly “achieved a significant technological breakthrough despite US sanctions,” a “dual deck” memory device joining two wafers together through hybrid bonding to produce a total of 294 gates. Memory chip leaders like Samsung and Hynix are reportedly watching these developments with the concern that YMTC’s hybrid bonding technology may enable stacking of additional layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-chinese-workarounds-to-sanctions&quot;&gt;Potential Chinese Workarounds to Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese policymakers and industry executives are exploring innovative ways to work around Western sanctions, efforts which likely would not have been undertaken absent the restrictions. While at first glance some of these solutions appear far-fetched, it is not inconceivable that they could lead to destabilizing breakthroughs—an excellent example of which is the January 2025 release of the DeepSeek AI app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packaging:&lt;/strong&gt; A stratagem reportedly being used by Chinese chip designers to offset the impact of sanctions is engaging Malaysian packaging firms to assemble GPUs to support AI, a move that apparently does not violate the sanctions. As noted in Malaysian news sources, “advanced packaging of chips can significantly improve chip performance and is emerging as a critical technology in the semiconductor industry,” enabling, among other things, the creation of “chiplets where chips are packaged tightly to work as one powerful brain.” While China lags behind Taiwanese, Korean, and U.S. firms in advanced packaging technology, it still promises to stretch the performance of domestically designed and manufactured chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photonics:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese scientists have reportedly developed a low-cost method for producing photonic integrated circuits for use in supercomputers and data centers using photons to communicate information, based on the material lithium tantalate. The discovery is expected to help “reduce the impact of US sanctions.” In October 2024, China’s silicon photonics JFS Laboratory disclosed that it had succeeded in lighting up a laser light source integrated with a silicon-based chip, filling in “one of the few blanks” in China’s optoelectronics technology.” Chinese scientists are also reportedly experimenting with alternatives to silicon substrates to circumvent sanctions, such as silicon carbide, cubic boron arsenide, and graphene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative Forms of Lithography:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s Tsinghua University has announced a plan to bypass Western restrictions on the export of lithography machines by developing a particle accelerator with an electron beam that can serve as a high-quality light source for on-site chip manufacturing. The plan is to build a “colossal” factory housing multiple lithography machines arrayed around the particle accelerator, enabling production of 2 nm chips in high volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;long-run-prospects-chinas-inherent-advantages&quot;&gt;Long-Run Prospects: China’s Inherent Advantages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Western sanctions have dealt a severe blow to China’s semiconductor design ecosystem, they have also served as a major stimulus to the indigenous development China has sought for decades. And it is important to keep in mind that over the long term, China’s design sector enjoys intrinsic advantages that will ensure that its global market share grows throughout the remainder of this decade and beyond. The massive and focused government support noted above is assured, providing major incentives in resources and reliable ongoing support for firms to invest—a situation in sharp contrast to that endured by early-stage Western firms. China also benefits from other positive factors, such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massive Domestic Demand:&lt;/strong&gt; China consumes over half of the world’s semiconductors, and demand from domestic OEMs represents an enormous potential advantage for Chinese chip designers. Chinese OEMs account for 27 percent of global chip demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Domestic Alternatives:&lt;/strong&gt; As noted, traditionally China-based OEMs have depended heavily on imported chips, but “as a direct result of US export restrictions, non-US OEMs are increasingly turning to locally designed semiconductors.” The geographic proximity of Chinese designers to domestic OEMs represents an added advantage. Restrictions on the sale of advanced Nvidia AI chips, for example, induced local OEMs to turn to Huawei-designed Ascend chipsets as an alternative; an executive at a major Chinese internet company said that the performance of the Huawei chipsets “was inferior to Nvidia chips, but we can definitely use them.” Over the longer term, Chinese strengths in 5G, Internet of Things, electric vehicles, and other end-use markets will increase demand pull for Chinese chip designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Capital:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2020, China graduated 2 million people with bachelor’s degrees in science and engineering, more than double the United States’ 900,000. While the quality of these graduates may vary, semiconductor design is unusually reliant on creative individuals, and over the long run China’s ability to educate vast numbers of students with the requisite skill sets constitutes an enormous competitive asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, China launched the 2029 STEM Action Plan to promote students’ access to STEM education, and in 2019, China added STEM to its primary school curriculum. Concurrently, the Ministry of Education created IC doctoral programs at 19 universities. Significantly, a European study observed in 2023 that for the first time, at the 2023 International Solid State Circuits Conference—a highly prestigious academic semiconductor conference—a majority of the accepted papers were submitted by Chinese institutions. At the same time, the 2022 SIA/BCG study of the U.S. design sector warned that “the supply of [U.S.] design talent is dwindling” and forecast a shortfall of 23,000 designers by 2030, reflecting “the number of experienced engineers leaving the industry” and the inadequate number of U.S. STEM graduates. This situation is compounded by current restrictions on immigration limiting access to high-quality engineers eager to work in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Need for Policy Continuity and Resources at Scale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, Secretary Raimondo called for CHIPS-related follow-on legislation supporting additional investments in semiconductors: “Whether you call it Chips Two or something else—continued investment [is needed] if we want to lead the world.” Gaurav Gupta, an executive at the Gartner consultancy, strongly concurs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the first time this money has been made available. And, as a result, you’re seeing a lot of chipmakers announcing new fabs and capacity expansions . . . But this has to be a more consistent policy from the US government through the next decade and beyond if they’re really serious about bringing back more chip manufacturing here in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To realize the new Trump administration’s goal of sustaining U.S. technology leadership in semiconductors, doubling down on support, backed by substantial and sustained investments and incentives, is essential. For this effort to succeed, U.S. policymakers need to recognize the strategic importance of the chip design sector and the unprecedented challenges it faces. Chip design is the highest value additive stage of semiconductor fabrication, accounting for over 50 percent of the value of a semiconductor, more than even front-end fabrication. Design leadership represents a huge economic and strategic advantage for the U.S. economy. As such, it is by far too valuable a competitive advantage to lose, and public policy deliberations to secure the future of the U.S. semiconductor industry must be broadened accordingly to assure continued leadership in semiconductor design. The industry’s current success is no guarantee of its future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To realize the new Trump administration’s goal of sustaining U.S. technology leadership in semiconductors, doubling down on support, backed by substantial and sustained investments and incentives, is essential. For this effort to succeed, U.S. policymakers need to recognize the strategic importance of the chip design sector and the unprecedented challenges it faces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-policies-are-needed&quot;&gt;What Policies Are Needed?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incoming Trump administration has recognized the strategic challenges facing the U.S. semiconductor industry. While the exact policy measures needed to ensure the continued success of U.S. chip design remain to be determined, the 2022 SIA/BCG study offered valuable suggestions for policymakers’ consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Investment:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased public investments and tax incentives to support chip design R&amp;amp;D are needed, particularly as the doubling of precompetitive chip R&amp;amp;D from 2023 to 2027 authorized in the CHIPS Act has not been appropriated. Given Chinese government focus, subsidies, and investments in research and talent, these funds need to be made available to U.S. labs and universities. Investment resources are essential for the United States’ long-term ability to compete, a perspective China fully understands and is reflected in the scale of its R&amp;amp;D and educational investments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote Domestic Talent:&lt;/strong&gt; As in the space race, financial incentives are needed to increase the number of students entering STEM fields and to encourage undergraduates and graduate students to enter the field of chip design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grow the Talent Pool:&lt;/strong&gt; There should be a targeted, national security–based reform of immigration policies to enable well-trained foreign chip designers to enter and remain in the United States. Given the challenge, the United States needs policies comparable to those put in place to attract international physicists for the Manhattan nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognize the Calming Value of Trade:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. chip design leadership would be aided by adopting trade and export control policies that do not accelerate the balkanization of global markets and that reduce incentives for autarkic policy approaches. Despite intensifying competition and the need for policy measures to address the challenges posed by Chinese mercantilism, the global economy remains tightly linked. Greater disruption in this sector could be costly and may well be counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand Tax Incentives:&lt;/strong&gt; It is worth noting that an investment tax credit of 25 percent for chip design was nearly included in the CHIPS Act, a proposed measure that would be essential to include in the next round of legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and other measures should be part of ongoing policy dialogue to identify industry needs and policies to ensure continued U.S. leadership in this strategic segment of the semiconductor industry. What the United States cannot afford in terms of its global competitiveness and national security is to take a business-as-usual approach in the face of government-backed global competition for advanced technologies. The United States is ahead in this crucial industry; it should not wait until it has fallen behind to support chip design in the face of the Chinese challenge. On the contrary, with the right policy and financial support, the United States can continue to surge ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

In a new Interim Report, its AI Policy Study Group indicated significant changes in the country’s AI strategy. Hiroki Habuka unpacks the document’s implications for Japanese AI governance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, it seemed clear among the major developed economies that significant new regulatory frameworks for artificial intelligence (AI) were imminent. In the United States, the Biden administration had passed a sweeping AI executive order in October 2023, and congressional leaders were working toward comprehensive AI legislation for 2024. Meanwhile, the European Union was preparing to pass the EU AI Act, which it ultimately did in May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan was also a participant in this prevailing trend. Two key publications from the first half of 2024 strongly signaled that Japan was heading toward new legislation aimed to more comprehensively regulate AI technology: in February, a concept paper from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and in May, a white paper by the Japanese Cabinet Office’s AI Strategy team. Both documents recommended the introduction of new regulations for large-scale foundational models. All signs suggested that Japan was moving in parallel with its allies toward establishing a strengthened regulatory structure for AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of 2024, however, the prospects for tough AI regulation in the United States and Europe had changed significantly. Not only did the United States never pass AI legislation, but also U.S. voters reelected President Donald Trump, who fulfilled a campaign promise to repeal the Biden administration’s AI executive order on the first day of his second term in office. The European Union, for its part, is still working to implement the AI Act, but influential documents such as the Draghi report on EU competitiveness suggest widespread concerns in the European Union that its AI regulatory efforts may have gone too far and stifled innovation. These concerns have been carried forward in the European Commission’s white paper “A Competitiveness Compass for the EU,” which emphasizes the necessity of achieving simpler, lighter, and faster regulation. At the AI Action Summit, EU President Ursula von der Leyen committed to reducing bureaucratic hurdles. Meanwhile, the French government is reportedly working to ensure that implementation of the AI Act is more focused on promoting innovation and less focused on regulating potential harms than drafters of the legislation anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, like its U.S. and EU allies, is hitting the brakes on the race to regulate AI. On February 4, 2025, the Japanese government’s Cabinet Office released the interim report of its AI Policy Study Group (henceforth “the Interim Report,” or “the Report”), which outlined a very different vision for AI regulation than the country’s two reports from the first half of the previous year. This CSIS white paper outlines the direction of Japan’s AI regulatory approach in 2025, based on the contents of the Interim Report, while also incorporating Japan’s response to the so-called DeepSeek Shock. A summary of the Interim Report is provided in the Appendix for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maintaining-a-sector-specific-approach-to-ai-regulation&quot;&gt;Maintaining a Sector-Specific Approach to AI Regulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Policy Study Group is an expert committee established under the Cabinet Office; it serves as the central body overseeing Japan’s AI policy development as a whole, covering both regulatory and promotional policies. In contrast to the ambitious regulatory trends observed during the first half of 2024, the Interim Report published by the AI Policy Study Group in February 2025 adopts a markedly more cautious stance. The Interim Report underscores Japan’s preference for relying on existing sector-specific laws rather than imposing sweeping AI-specific regulations, in accordance with the principle of technological neutrality. It also highlights the importance of voluntary risk-mitigation initiatives undertaken by businesses, while committing the government to the continuous monitoring of emerging risks and necessary measures. As part of this effort, the Report suggests new legislation to establish a government strategic leadership body to enable the collection of necessary information for policies and cooperation on information about major incidents, but without legal sanctions. This marked departure from earlier proposals is reflective of the complex nature of AI risks, the current limitations in assessing the safety of advanced AI models, and the broader trend of regulatory easing observed under the new Trump administration—whose repeal of the Biden-era AI executive order set a clear and early precedent. Additionally, the outcome of the October 2024 general election in Japan, in which the ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority, has resulted in a fragmented Diet, making the advancement of ambitious legislative reforms a formidable challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI systems are designed to make sophisticated inferences and decisions based on large datasets and numerous parameters using statistical and probabilistic methods. In this sense, the dangers posed by AI are less about fundamentally introducing new types of risks and more about amplifying existing risks. From this perspective, the stance outlined in the Interim Report, which places greater reliance on existing legal frameworks and voluntary industry measures, appears reasonable and consistent with Japan’s established policy approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;balancing-business-led-ai-governance-and-strategic-government-leadership&quot;&gt;Balancing Business-Led AI Governance and Strategic Government Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Interim Report, it appears likely that the Japanese government will rely on businesses’ voluntary commitments to address AI risks under existing laws. However, simply delegating risk management does not mean that all businesses will immediately be able to address risks appropriately. In particular, startup companies—which are key drivers of innovation—often lack sufficient resources to dedicate to safety and governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this white paper proposes that the government’s newly established strategic leadership body take the initiative in reducing the cost and complexity of responsibly implementing AI across society. This would be accomplished by continuously producing outputs such as clarifications of the interpretation of laws in specific areas, guidance on methods for evaluating AI safety, updates to the AI Guidelines for Business (a risk management framework), and contractual guidelines for entities across the supply chain. In fact, the Japanese government previously pursued similar approaches in 2024, proposing guidance on the interpretation of existing laws as well as directions for new legislative measures in specific areas such as copyrights, other intellectual property rights, and personal information, as well as measures to address disinformation and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-key-to-success-transparency-and-effective-guidance&quot;&gt;The Key to Success: Transparency and Effective Guidance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Japanese government does successfully transition to a continuous production of outputs relevant to AI, it should move away from closed, non-transparent discussions—like those of the current AI Policy Study Group—and instead adopt a transparent multi-stakeholder process that brings together knowledge from a wide range of fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, it is essential that, in principle, information requested from private businesses not be conducted for the purpose of criticizing companies; instead, it should aim to gather best practices and conduct proactive evaluations. Sensitive information should be handled cautiously, such as by limiting its disclosure to specific recipients, so as to ensure that the innovation and economic growth incentives of AI developers and providers are preserved. The information collection mechanism should be operated in a way that avoids creating a situation where businesses that cooperate are criticized based on the content they disclose, while those that refuse to cooperate face no scrutiny—a “no good deed goes unpunished” scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japans-response-to-the-deepseek-shock&quot;&gt;Japan’s Response to the DeepSeek Shock&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is worth touching upon Japan’s response to the DeepSeek Shock. The emergence of DeepSeek—a high-performance, small-scale, and low-cost AI model from China—garnered significant attention in Japan. Interestingly, the Interim Report was drafted and released for public comment before the DeepSeek Shock occurred in January 2025, with only the final version published in February after the event. However, in the end, the DeepSeek Shock had little impact on the content of the Interim Report; the Report had already rejected the idea of regulating only large-scale foundational models (an approach initially proposed in early 2024). Moreover, the Report emphasized that, even if future regulations were considered, risk assessments should be conducted based on actual risks rather than on model size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, concerns regarding national security risks associated with Chinese-developed AI models remain. For example, during Diet deliberations, it became a point of contention that DeepSeek described the Senkaku Islands—territory claimed by both Japan and China—as “China’s inherent territory, both historically and under international law.” In response, Prime Minister Ishiba adhered to the policy direction outlined in the Interim Report, stating that the government would accelerate preparations for legislation that authorizes the government to first issue administrative guidance and, if deemed insufficient, take stronger measures against AI risks. In addition, on February 6, 2025, the Japanese government issued an advisory to government ministries and agencies regarding the use of DeepSeek. This notice primarily highlighted that data acquired by DeepSeek is stored on servers in China and thus subject to Chinese legal jurisdiction. However, beyond this, it largely reiterated existing guidance issued in 2023 regarding the use of generative AI by government agencies, such as prohibiting the entry of sensitive information into AI prompts and requiring agencies to consult the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity and the Digital Agency in cases involving systems used for national security and public safety operations, as well as those handling highly confidential information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now, Japan has no specific restrictions on the use of DeepSeek by private entities. In fact, the country’s private sector has largely welcomed the emergence of DeepSeek. This is due not only to its high performance, small scale, and low cost, but also its open-weight nature. Many tech companies have already begun developing and offering their own fine-tuned versions of DeepSeek’s models tailored to their specific needs. Moreover, concerns over national security biases and the absence of built-in safeguards can be substantially mitigated through additional fine-tuning conducted by these companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this does not mean that DeepSeek and its derivative models are exempt from regulation. As analyzed in detail in the table in the Interim Report (see this paper’s Appendix), existing laws already regulate the manipulation of information through disinformation and misinformation as well as the unauthorized use of acquired data. Furthermore, the new legislation hinted at in the Interim Report is designed to enable the government to collect potential legal violations and best practices for risk mitigation, ensuring that emerging AI risks are effectively addressed within Japan’s regulatory framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-ahead-japans-ai-policy-in-a-shifting-landscape&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead: Japan’s AI Policy in a Shifting Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the global outlook for AI governance becomes increasingly uncertain in 2025, Japan’s role in contributing to international rulemaking through frameworks such as the G7 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development will grow in importance. It will be a critical test for Japan to design and implement legal systems, under a constructive public-private partnership, that can manage various risks to an acceptable level while maximizing the benefits that AI brings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix&quot;&gt;Appendix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS OF THE DRAFT INTERIM REPORT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Interim Report presents a vision for the future design of AI policies in Japan by elaborating on five basic approaches and six specific policy proposals including potential new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;KEY POINTS OF THE DRAFT INTERIM REPORT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;emphasis-on-voluntary-initiatives-by-businesses-and-a-softer-regulatory-tone&quot;&gt;Emphasis on Voluntary Initiatives by Businesses and a Softer Regulatory Tone&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Interim Report emphasizes that AI risks should primarily be addressed by the voluntary initiatives and creative efforts of businesses. It suggests that the establishment of new regulations targeting large-scale AI models or the adoption of comprehensive AI regulations (such as those in the European Union) is not currently being considered as a policy direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this does not mean that all responsibilities are left entirely to businesses. The Report proposes establishing a strategic leadership body within the government to enhance coordination among relevant ministries and agencies. It also recommends enacting necessary legislation for government-led information collection, aiming for the integrated implementation of AI-related policies based on best practices from businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-five-basic-approaches-to-legal-systems&quot;&gt;The Five “Basic Approaches to Legal Systems”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Interim Report consists of two main parts: “Basic Approaches to Legal Systems” and “Direction of Specific Legal Systems and Policies.” For the former, the following principles are outlined:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Respecting Voluntary Initiatives by Businesses&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Given the conservative compliance approaches of Japanese companies, the establishment of new regulations is expected to have a significant chilling effect. Therefore, the Report emphasizes respecting voluntary initiatives by businesses and limiting regulations to areas where such voluntary efforts are insufficient to adequately address risks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leveraging Existing Sectoral Laws in Lieu of Comprehensive AI Regulation&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While the prevailing opinion is that Japan addresses AI risks primarily through a soft law approach, it is a misconception that Japan lacks hard laws related to AI. The Interim Report lists numerous existing laws addressing various risk areas, such as the leakage of confidential information, intellectual property rights infringement, privacy, malfunction, deepfakes, bias, information manipulation, and cyberattacks (see Table 1 below). The Report proposes addressing AI risks by evolving these existing laws within their respective sectors. Conversely, comprehensive and cross-sectoral regulations like the European Union’s AI Act are clearly not being pursued.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimal and Technology-Neutral Regulation&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;According to the Interim Report, even when new legislation is necessary, it should be limited to truly essential areas. The principle of “technology neutrality” should be observed to avoid imposing disproportionately high requirements solely on AI. In principle, new regulations should not be created merely because a technology is labeled as “AI” (any more than it should be regulated merely because it is “software”), as this is both legally difficult and unnecessary. Care should also be taken to avoid hindering legitimate research and to ensure that startups and other businesses can comply with regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Risk-Based and Case-Specific Approaches&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As part of general measures, the Interim Reports recommends encouraging the use of the “AI Guidelines for Business,” which should be continuously updated based on the results of government-led information collection (see section 2 below). The responsibilities of AI developers, providers, and users should be carefully considered, with a focus on promoting the sharing and coordination of necessary information among stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For AI risks inadequately addressed by existing laws, responses should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the severity and nature of the risks. The Report highlights the importance of avoiding arbitrary enforcement or undue chilling effects when conducting fact-finding investigations necessary for policy decisions or requesting information-sharing cooperation from businesses. The Interim Report also states that regulations should not be uniformly applied based on the scale of AI models (e.g., floating-point operations per second, or FLOPS) or the number of users but should instead be tailored to actual risks (i.e., taking a risk-based approach).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contribution to the Formation of International Norms&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Building on the Hiroshima AI Process established by G7 members at the 2023 Hiroshima Summit chaired by Japan, the Interim Report emphasizes respecting principles agreed upon in various international frameworks, such as the United Nations’ Global Digital Compact, the Council of Europe’s Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence, the OECD’s AI Principles, and the resolutions of the Global Partnership on AI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To ensure the international alignment and interoperability of rules, the Report advocates for Japan’s active participation in international standardization efforts, such as those of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). It also highlights the importance of consolidating and sharing domestic and international knowledge through collaboration among the AI Safety Institutes established in various countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-six-specific-directions-for-legal-systems&quot;&gt;The Six “Specific Directions for Legal Systems”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the basic approaches outlined above, the Interim Report presents the following specific directions for legal systems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthening the Government’s Strategic Leadership Functions and Establishing a Strategic Plan (“Matters That Should Be Legislated”)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The process of AI research, development, and application involves diverse actors and complex activities that interact with one another. Therefore, the Interim Report emphasizes the necessity of a government-wide strategic leadership function to oversee and coordinate these activities. This includes wide-ranging participation from relevant ministries and agencies, along with a strategic plan outlining strategies for AI safety and utilization. To ensure the effectiveness of this strategic leadership body, its establishment and authority to request cooperation from relevant administrative agencies should be codified into law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promoting Transparency and Appropriateness and Introducing Information Provision Requests (“Matters Suitable for Legislative Action”)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To ensure AI safety, the Report highlights the importance of transparency and appropriateness.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Regarding transparency, the Interim Report recommends the sharing of necessary information along the AI value chain among developers, providers, and users to prevent risks from materializing. However, to avoid excessive disclosure that could compromise trade secrets or sensitive information during the research and development stage, information sharing should be limited to what is “truly necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To ensure appropriateness—which likely refers to objective safety and reliability—the Report proposes that the government develop guidelines based on international standards, such as those set forth in the Hiroshima AI Process, while encouraging voluntary initiatives by businesses. The guidelines may include provisions requiring AI developers and other relevant parties to take measures to reduce inappropriate outputs, disclose and share information on the overview and risks of AI systems, and promote appropriate transparency of training datasets. Additionally, attention should be paid to international trends in misinformation and disinformation countermeasures, such as requirements to notify users when a service is AI-powered or to label AI-generated content as such.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To support these measures, the Report suggests codifying provisions that enable the government to request information from businesses to understand their situation and provide necessary support. However, such requests are not expected to immediately impose mandatory obligations on businesses; instead, they are likely to encourage voluntary cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voluntary Evaluations for AI Systems and Certification for AI Governance&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As AI becomes increasingly integrated into products and services, it is desirable to establish agreed-upon evaluation and certification systems for both AI systems and the governance of organizations using AI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Interim Report suggests that for AI systems, safety evaluations should primarily rely on businesses’ voluntary risk assessments. On the other hand, third-party certification is identified as an effective approach for the governance of organizations using AI. This may include obtaining certifications under standards such as ISO/IEC 42001.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investigating Major Incidents and Information Disclosure to the Public (“Matters Suitable for Legislative Action”)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For AI models that are widely used by the public or integrated into critical infrastructure services, the government should collect information on the actual conditions of their implementation and any ensuing risks, including risks arising from the involvement of diverse stakeholders in the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the event of major accidents or issues caused by AI, the government should investigate the root causes, provide guidance to stakeholders on preventive measures, and disclose relevant information to the public. To ensure cooperation from businesses in such cases, the Interim Report suggests introducing a legal framework that enables the government to request information from domestic and international businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promoting AI Adoption by the Government and Developing Procurement Guidelines&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To promote the adoption of highly safe AI systems, the government should develop guidelines that clarify criteria and procedures for AI procurement, addressing risks such as those related to supply chains and specific risks unique to AI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The government is also encouraged to take the lead in using AI to enhance the efficiency and quality of administrative services and operations. However, in areas where AI-based automated decisionmaking could significantly impact the rights and interests of citizens, the government should carefully recognize the associated risks and proceed with caution. Additionally, existing agreements on the handling of sensitive information should be reviewed and updated as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Addressing Risks to Life, Physical Safety, Systemic Stability, and National Security by Relevant Ministries&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In areas with significant societal impact—such as medical devices, autonomous vehicles, and critical infrastructure services—relevant ministries and agencies should address risks through existing laws and guidelines while considering revisions or new legal instruments if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For systemic risks, such as where multiple AI systems may become interconnected in the future leading to large-scale disruptions due to unexpected behaviors, relevant ministries should continue to assess and address these challenges. Similarly, for national security risks, such as the use of AI in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats and cyberattacks, relevant ministries and agencies should deepen their examination and responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-range precision strike capabilities and the ability to defend against them have an increasingly prominent place in Russian and NATO thinking about current and future warfare. This paper assesses the role of long-range strike on the modern battlefield and the relative competitive advantages of each side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper finds that the deterrent and competitive effects of long-range strike outweigh their impact in conflict. While militaries often do find ways to weather the impact of long-range strike (as well as interdiction from the air – which is separate but related), doing so is disproportionately costly. Moreover, narratives regarding the impact of strike have an independent effect on military behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Russia’s case, the country’s military thinkers have long been invested in the idea that the ability to dislocate an opponent at depth is of decisive importance on the modern battlefield. True or not, this will influence Russian decision-making in two ways: first, the speed at which forces can be dislocated in depth incentivises forward deployment and readiness, both of which run counter to scaling; and second, layered air defences against missile threats can be prohibitively costly in terms of interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding this challenge is the fact that Russia has lost strategic depth, meaning that missiles which would previously have been understood as being effective at tactical ranges can now impact operationally and even strategically relevant targets. Russia can surmount this, but at a considerable opportunity cost in terms of layering air defences. This means that relatively anodyne strike capabilities such as short-range ballistic missiles can have a disproportionately competitive effect for NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, the Alliance faces its own competitive challenges. Chief among these is that both protecting critical military capabilities and providing security to a wide range of civilian targets will stretch NATO’s surface-based air defences beyond the limits of their capacity. In addition, the currently federated space-based infrastructure of Allied nations will become an economy of force target for Russia if it wishes to avoid running an arms race on unfavourable terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper discusses how the Alliance can use its own competitive advantages to shape Russian decision-making, and how it can mitigate the risk of Russia doing the same thing in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militaries have placed increasing emphasis on the ability to see and strike in depth since the latter stages of the Cold War, when Western concepts of operations, such as Follow-on Forces Attack, placed a heavy emphasis on the ability to engage the Soviet second echelon at operational and even theatre depths. Capabilities including guided multiple-launch rocket systems (GMLRS), Gryphon ground-launched cruise missiles and Pershing-II intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) were, in tandem with fixed-wing aircraft, intended to disrupt and attrit Soviet forces and dislocate the USSR’s command-and-control (C2) structures before contact on the Forward Line of Own Troops (FLOT). The Soviets in turn believed that the convergence of high-fidelity sensors, processing power and deep strike were driving, in the words of Marshal Ogarkov, a “military technical revolution”, in which forces would be able to find, fix and engage each other at increasing speeds and distances. This drove the development of capabilities such as the OTR-23 Oka (a predecessor of the Russian Iskander short-range ballistic missile, SRBM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, the threat posed by deep-strike capabilities reinforced an existing institutional emphasis on both ground-based air defences and methods of disrupting adversary kill chains in both the USSR and post-Soviet Russia. By contrast – and despite initial similarities with Soviet/Russian approaches – much Western thinking about the idea of a revolution in military affairs for the two decades immediately after the Cold War placed considerable emphasis on the ability to use presumed access to both ISR and precision strike (albeit in the form of airpower, rather than long-range missiles) as a scalpel with which to engage elusive targets in politically complex terrain. On the other side of the coin, layered air and missile defence capabilities were assumed to be a requirement for achieving a high probability of kill against a well-defined and numerically limited number of threats, so as to offset the risk of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear use by opponents with weaker conventional weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dynamic has changed considerably in Europe, where a number of militaries have returned to emphasising the importance of achieving deep interdiction. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has reinforced this, prompting significant investments in both air-to-surface and surface-to-surface strike capabilities, as well as integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this, there are grounds for an examination of the way in which the ability to prosecute both the offensive and defensive components of a modern strike campaign can reinforce deterrence and competitive advantage in Europe. The question bears examining as both air defence and strike – despite their utility – require complex enablement and exquisite systems, and incur opportunity costs with respect to the ability to invest in other capabilities. In particular, some observers have questioned the military advantage of being able to see and strike deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-areas&quot;&gt;Key Areas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this paper is to examine three key areas of enquiry. First, it provides an examination of the utility of deep-strike capabilities in the context of the operating environment in Europe. Second, it provides a net assessment of Allied and Russian strengths with respect to their ability to both prosecute strike campaigns and defend against them. Finally, the paper provides a set of principles which might be used to guide Allied procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major hypothesis of the paper is that the capacity for deep interdiction is of strategic significance but, paradoxically, is unlikely to be militarily decisive. Its significance pertains to both its deterrent value and its value as a competitive tool that forces an opponent to take on costly countermeasures. As a consequence, procurement of both strike and IAMD capabilities should be guided by a logic of relative cost imposition – the degree to which one’s own force and Russia’s are compelled to accept opportunity costs to mitigate the risks that deep-strike capabilities create – rather than by a purely military logic that examines the offensive or defensive utility of a given tool in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper intends to contribute to the development of a conceptual foundation through which the roles of deep strike and IAMD as tools of deterrence, competition and warfare can be understood. The paper focuses on the balance of forces between NATO members on one side (with a particular focus on the Alliance’s European members) and Russia on the other. The authors’ deductions emphasise the competitive approach, which should guide Allied efforts at generating deep-strike and IAMD capabilities, but the programmatic questions of how capability should be delivered are beyond the paper’s remit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology of this paper includes desk research, operations analysis and a review of 15 years of Russian military journals such as Военная Мысль (Military Thought), Вооружение и экономика (Armaments and Economy) and Современная авиация (Modern Aviation.) The purpose of this review was to identify patterns in Russian thinking about the risks posed by Allied strike capabilities and the counterinvestments Russia should make. The research also used a support tool developed by a partner organisation, DIEM Analytics, which uses deep neural networks to forecast an actor’s behaviour, based on both formative experiences and past behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the outputs of the paper are not definitive with respect to procurement choices, they seek to shed light on the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are Russian leaders likely to see as the opportunities and challenges they face in the contemporary deep battle?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the strengths and limitations of any effort to achieve deep effects?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where do these efforts add value and when do they present an opportunity cost?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which principles should guide NATO efforts to offset the Russian threat beyond the FLOT?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-utility-of-striking-at-depth&quot;&gt;I. The Utility of Striking at Depth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would appear that the ability to strike in depth is useful, but rarely decisive. The historical record of efforts to do so, whether through airpower or surface-to-surface capabilities, is mixed at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deep-strike-for-battlefield-interdiction&quot;&gt;Deep Strike for Battlefield Interdiction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battlefield interdiction (historically provided by airpower) played an important role in the Vietnam War (during Operation Linebacker I) and the 1991 Gulf War, but the most important effects air assets provided were in the close battle. Longer-range US airpower failed to close the Ho Chi Minh trail, and theLinebacker II raids did not stop the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) from moving into position. In the absence of US close air support in subsequent battles, the NVA would have overwhelmed the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Although air strikes on railheads caused initial backlogs, the NVA was able to rely on forward-positioned stockpiles and then pivot to a truck-based system (which was capable of moving 10,000 tons of goods by road) to resource attacks such as its assaults on Qang Tri and An Loc, with the latter assault supported by 78,000 artillery rounds. By contrast, close air support against NVA forces in combat did prove critical, inflicting the majority of casualties incurred by the NVA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, during the 1991 Gulf War, US strategic interdiction as part of Operation Instant Thunder did not have the desired effect of paralysing the Iraqi C2 system to the point that it could not coordinate troop movements. Subsequent interdiction operations inflicted considerable losses on units redeployed from depth (largely from the Iraqi Republican Guard), but none of these units was degraded to the point of non-functionality. Supply-line disruptions caused by air strikes on 126 highway and rail bridges were generally circumvented much more rapidly than might have been expected, through the use of ferries, pontoons and dredging. Similarly, attacks on truck convoys were accommodated through the use of smaller convoys. However, this is not to say that the ability to strike in depth had no impact on Iraqi supplies. Although well supplied, the Iraqi military lost much of its capacity to redistribute supplies in a rational manner, leading to uneven distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, in the war in Ukraine, the impact of long-range strikes (albeit at tactical ranges) to achieve supply-line interdiction has been more positive, although still mixed. Both Russia and Ukraine have employed strike platforms capable of engaging targets at up to corps depth, including the HIMARS rocket system in the case of Ukraine, and the Russian Tornado-S. The HIMARS’s initial effect on the Ukrainian battlefields was dramatic, with the ability to strike the munitions storage sites and C2 structures of an artillery-centric Russian army playing a major role in the culmination of the Russian offensive in the Donbas, which began in July 2022. However, the Russian army adapted to the threat of the extended-range GMLRS in a number of ways, including moving ammunition storage further to the rear of its lines and adapting its approach to electronic warfare to account for the threat posed. In theatres such as Kherson, reliance on the Antonivka bridge – which was rendered unusable – forced the Russian military to supply forces through a costly and time-intensive effort involving ferries and barges, which compelled its withdrawal from the city. However, the impact on Russian logistics, while significant, was not critical. Russian rates of fire across the frontline steadily rose after the initial shock of exposure to precision fire and, at the time of writing, amounted to approximately 10,000 shells a day. Interdiction of supplies in depth has imposed high levels of friction on the Russian army, but it has not prevented it from delivering large volumes of personnel and materiel to the frontline. The results, while important, fall short of operational paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;targeting-command-and-control-and-communications&quot;&gt;Targeting Command and Control and Communications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second approach to the use of deep-strike capabilities is as a means of targeting C2 nodes and undermining an opponent’s broader capacity to communicate. Here, the ability to strike at depth appears to have achieved some effects (although the sample size is smaller, since the ability to reliably target C2 nodes is largely a product of the era of precision strike).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Gulf War, a key objective of Operation Instant Thunder was to separate Iraq’s political leaders from frontline units and Iraqi society more broadly. Despite the significant levels of disruption achieved, neither the Iraqi political system nor its military were paralysed. The Iraqi military was, however, compelled to emplace a network of field cables to enable a degree of communication (but not coordination) and to limit communication between units more generally. This does not seem to have affected the Iraqi army’s ability to deploy or coordinate its forces at the operational level, but it does appear to have slowed the tactical responsiveness of Iraqi forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, the effectiveness of missiles such as Storm Shadow in tactical terms seems to have been high, at least based on what can be gathered through open source literature. However, the desired operational-level effects have been less clearly visible. It is apparent, for example, that the ability to target Russian command posts beyond 90 km did not decisively alter the course of the Ukrainian counter-offensive – which might be attributed to the fact that the sequencing of strikes and offensive activity was not tightly coordinated. One reason for this may be that a considerable amount of shaping activity goes into individual strikes, and that cruise missile attacks are often preceded by days of attacks with lower-cost UAVs to saturate and dislocate surface-to-air-missile (SAM) systems. The heavier the burden of enablement, the harder it becomes to sequence effects, given that this adds a layer of complexity to planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a NATO context, staff at an Allied air component command will have their duties divided between missions such as offensive counter-air, suppression of enemy air defences (SEAD), defensive counter-air, close air support, and interdiction (with the allocated proportions varying over time). Currently, tasks such as intermediate target development are highly time consuming (as reflected in the 72 hours it takes to generate an air-tasking order), and this challenge will need to be overcome if dynamic strikes at a high tempo are to be delivered at operational depth. In ground formations that control strike assets such as Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), the challenge of target development might in some ways be simplified by a unit’s narrower geographical focus and the fact that it is synchronising fewer capabilities, but it will also have fewer personnel available to plan strikes, and more limited access to ISR from higher echelons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-deep-strike&quot;&gt;Russian Deep Strike&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s own deep strike campaign has a similarly mixed record. The Russian military’s long-range strike campaign in Ukraine has employed a range of weapons, including ballistic missiles (the KH-47M2 Kinzhal and the 9M723), cruise missiles (such as the 3M-14, the KH-101 and the KH-22) and cheaper one-way attack UAVs. In the initial phases of the war, the Russian aim appears to have been paralysis of the Ukrainian system and in particular its C2 structures – an approach that delivered limited results, and ultimately gave way to a process that placed much heavier emphasis on targeting critical national infrastructure (CNI) and Ukraine’s energy grid in particular. Russia’s own relatively slow planning process, in which targets selected by the military district-level command had to be fed into Akatsia-M (Russia’s battle management system) at the national defence management centre to create the equivalent of a Joint Priority Integrated Targeting List (JPITL) over the course of 48 hours, is likely to be the reason for its failure to strike dynamic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has tactically employed capabilities such as the Iskander and the Tochka-U ballistic missiles. In many instances, these systems have been used in the Donbas against targets such as SA-11 TELs (transport erector launchers) and GMLRS, among other systems, using feeds from UAVs coordinated via Strelets. However, in late 2022 the balance of Russia’s efforts shifted heavily in favour of striking fixed targets. The Russian strike campaign against Ukrainian energy infrastructure has been a qualified failure. At no point has the Ukrainian energy grid suffered systemic failure (despite coming very close at several points), and strategic bombing has not proven destructive to national morale. Nonetheless, the campaign has had the effect of forcing the allocation of Ukrainian SAM systems to the defence of CNI – limiting the cover for frontline units against the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) over time. Moreover, the Ukrainian network of SAM systems, despite being Europe’s most robust before the war and having been augmented with Western systems, has seen increasing shortfalls in interceptor capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, then, there is only limited evidence that the ability to strike at operational and strategic depth can have a transformative effect, despite its utility as a means of enabling other assets (for example by forcing the allocation of ground-based air defences away from the frontline).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;precision-strike-as-a-competitive-tool&quot;&gt;Precision Strike as a Competitive Tool&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the limitations described above, the capacity for deep interdiction has a strategic significance that extends beyond its battlefield utility. This mismatch between strategic significance and battlefield utility is understood with respect to other capabilities (most obviously nuclear weapons), but is often omitted from discussions of conventional deep strike. There are a number of reasons for reframing how precision strike is viewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is a widespread perception (including in Russia) that improvements in pervasive ISR, processing power and availability of strike capabilities may be on the cusp of making deep strike decisive, even if it has not been thus far. Whether this is true or not, Russia is likely to make strategic decisions based on this assumption. Second, while militaries can offset the impact of strike, this often involves both financial and operational costs that are disproportionately burdensome. Finally, building a military to offset the effects of strike narrows the force design options available to an actor. For example, the Soviet Union and then Russia responded to the risk of deep interdiction by emphasising forward positioning, readiness and layered organic air defences. For post-Soviet Russia, this necessitated, however, a smaller force that could be made highly ready and thus enabled. For Russia, as it contemplates increasing the size of its military under the plan of former minister of defence Sergei Shoigu, the requirement to counter deep strike would necessitate considerable force design trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as noted, the past military performance of efforts at deep interdiction may not be predictive of the future. In discussing the course of the conflict in Ukraine, Russian authors have assessed that the interval between Western satellites passing over Russian positions is around 15 minutes. While US efforts to deliver space support during the conflicts of the early 21st century were deemed to have been supported by too few satellites to enable a major strike campaign, many Russian authors have assessed that the growth of the commercial space sector has fundamentally changed this dynamic. Moreover, the challenge of false positives is described by A S Scherbakov and N C B Nikulin as transient, and will probably be resolved if a combination of multispectral imaging and databasing of target signatures are used over time. The resolution of commercial multispectral satellites such as DigitalGlobe’s Worldview-3 sensor means they can generate images with a 1.2-metre resolution (each pixel represents a 1 metre by 1 metre square on the ground, which is what some Russian authors estimate to be the resolution at which targets such as armoured personnel carriers can be reliably classified). Moreover, the existing commercial systems of companies such as Maxar can generate sufficiently reliable information for points of interest to be identified. Combined with a range of automated tools for classification, many of which already exist under the aegis of Project Maven, the scope and diversity of space-based ISR may bring to fruition the kind of reconnaissance strike complex that was envisioned in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a range of other tools with adequate processing power can be more fruitfully used. For example, in 2011 the UAVs employed by the US military generated 327,000 hours of footage, most of which has not been used; tools to sift relevant data from noise in peacetime could significantly abet tasks such as advanced target development and pattern-of-life analysis. Similarly, aspects of planning, such as the generation of a JPITL within a Combined Air Operations Centre, can be accelerated through automated network analysis to identify key nodes in an opposing system. Greater processing power, meanwhile, can accelerate and augment targeting processes in ways that enable forces to exploit the growth of available data. To use a practical example, the US XVIII Airborne Corps estimates that processing times can be reduced to around two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason why the competitive utility of deep strike may increase is that the existence of relatively scalable second-tier precision strike capabilities offers the promise of increasing the tempo at which a modern strike campaign can be prosecuted. There is an inverse relationship between the cost of being wrong and the willingness to rely on partial data or probabilistic inferences. For example, the major limiting factor on the tempo of Ukrainian strike operations has been the requirement to use a limited number of long-range strike capabilities judiciously. The emergence of systems such as one-way attack UAVs and reductions in the cost of some components (such as microelectronics) can change this dynamic. This is not because new systems are necessarily cheap – the IAI Harop loitering munition, for example, costs almost as much as a cruise missile, and while the Iranian Shahed-136 costs significantly less, this comes at a price in terms of functionality (lacking a seeker, for example). Rather, the absence of key long lead-time items, such as turbofan engines, makes it easier to increase the scale of a given capability. The more available a system is, the less elaborate the process of target development enabling its employment needs to be. The scale and tempo of a strike campaign can thus be increased, as seen in the case of the employment of UAVs in the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of whether their battlefield utility dramatically increases, deep strike capabilities have several important competitive functions with respect to shaping how an opponent prepares to fight. Athough the ability to see and strike at strategic depth rarely wins wars on its own, it can play an important role in dislocating an opponent’s capabilities. The existence of systems capable of striking at either tactical or strategic depth imposes opportunity costs in terms of the practical allocation of air defences. During the Gulf War, roughly half of all Iraqi SAM systems, including longer-ranged SA-6 and SA-8 SAMs, were committed to the defence of rear areas. In the case of the 1972 Easter Offensive, NVA forces were well supported, but it is nonetheless notable that the North Vietnamese integrated air defence system (IADS) expended more missiles over Hanoi during the Christmas bombings than they did on the frontline over the course of the Easter Offensive (and expended 68 SAMs for every bomber struck, which eventually led to the depletion of their SA-2 stocks ahead of the Paris Peace Accords).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, the requirement to defend cities and CNI against Russian cruise missiles, one-way attack UAVs and ballistic missiles has resulted in challenges for the Ukrainians with respect to providing ground-based air defence (GBAD) to the frontline – in turn allowing the VKS to operate more freely against Ukrainian forces. The effect in terms of resource allocation is likely to be accentuated for Russia, because Russian military literature demonstrates a systematic fear of strategic paralysis inflicted by strikes on C2 nodes. Indeed, although the effects of Operation Instant Thunder were marginal in the context of Operation Desert Storm, their impact on Russian decision-makers was considerable. Examples of this include the emphasis placed by figures such as Russia’s Chief of General Staff General Valery Gerasimov (among several others) on the impact of non-contact warfare in conjunction with information operations as a means of dislocating a state’s control. While the poor record of this theory of victory in Ukraine might drive a reassessment, articles published in military journals since the invasion appear to double down on this logic. This reflects the fact that organisations often learn first-order lessons about implementation more readily than they reassess fundamental assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a subjective element to any evaluation of the utility of long-range precision fires and other deep strike capabilities. As with any military tool, the way in which an opponent views and responds to it is of considerable importance when evaluating its competitive utility. For example, while the military utility of the US Strategic Defence Initiative was questionable, its subjective impact on Soviet policymakers’ assessments of the military balance was considerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-perspectives-on-long-range-strike&quot;&gt;Russian Perspectives on Long-Range Strike&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Russian thinking, long-range strike serves several functions. First, long-range precision strike is viewed as an important enabler of a state’s ability to prosecute an extended conflict by targeting the defence industrial capacity of a rival state or coalition. Efforts to target infrastructure critical to the successful prosecution of a protracted conflict, including (but not limited to) key components of a state’s energy grid and defence industrial facilities, are deemed to be an integral part of both Russian military planning and Russian assumptions regarding how an Allied strike campaign might progress. The template for this is the Allied air campaign against Serbia during the Kosovo war, which is assessed by a number of Russian authors as having inflicted crippling damage on the Serbian energy grid. The ability to both inflict damage and deflect efforts to eliminate Russia’s own productive capacity is viewed as central to the ability to demonstrate the capacity to win a protracted war and thus force war termination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, long-range precision strike has a crucial role in the Russian concept of deflecting strategic aerospace attacks. Russian military authors describe combined (and primarily US-led) aerospace attacks involving the convergence of cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons, UAVs and fixed-wing aircraft aimed primarily at knocking out targets such as airbases and C2 nodes. Russia assesses its own air and missile defences as insufficient to deflect this presumed integrated aerospace threat, which in turn necessitates the ability to strike adversary airbases and conduct (rather vaguely defined) “counter submarine-launched cruise missile” operations on the open oceans. The “air-space” theatre is described as a critical and integrated independent theatre of operations in which strike and air defence must be coordinated. It is also of some note that all US investment in prompt global strike capabilities is interpreted as being, at a minimum, a challenge against which Russia must hedge, and that Allied precision strike capabilities are viewed as an extension of US assets. As such, the regional allocation of US capabilities to a given combatant command (for example, US Indo-Pacific Command) may play a limited role in how Russia assesses the balance of forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia effectively faces two challenges, which draw on the same resource base. At operational-strategic depth, the perceived risk of paralysis will, as discussed, weigh heavily on the minds of Russian decision-makers. Equally, however, Russian military assessments of the threat posed by airpower at tactical depth correctly assume that Allied advantages in the air pose considerable risk to Russian ground forces. It has previously been assumed that assault by 50–70 tactical aircraft will inflict 50% attrition on an advancing Russian motor rifle brigade. Defence against both types of attack – which requires many of the same defensive SAM and EW systems – has depended on strategic buffer zones provided by client (or at a minimum neutral) states on legal instruments such as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and on the assumption that Russia would commit its forces on a pre-emptive basis. As things stand, two out of Russia’s three lines of defence have effectively disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows that Russia will expend outsized resources on long-range strike and IAMD as it reconstitutes its military – a pattern of investment that characterised Russia’s last state armament programme. President Vladimir Putin’s 2023 claim that Russia is producing three times as many SAM systems as the US, even if spurious, illustrates the extent to which Russia views this as a priority area for investment. And even with this claimed rate, it is notable that massing air defence systems on the 1,200-km frontline in Ukraine has required other frontiers to be effectively stripped bare of SAM systems. Assuming that a comparable or greater production rate is viewed as being at least an aspiration, and as a prerequisite for deploying forces effectively, maintaining this rate of production will necessarily compete with other avenues for expenditure, including the recruitment and training of additional forces, while air defence systems will draw on inputs such as solid fuel propellant and microprocessors that are employed in other systems. This would, in turn, incentivise something along the lines of the Serdyukov-era force structure – a smaller Russian military that can be made ready more quickly and be protected. Confronting such a force structure would prove easier for the Allied force design envisioned under NATO’s force model, which is being built to emphasise readiness, but which would struggle to sustain attritional combat against an echeloned Russian force comparable to the one envisioned under the plans laid out by Shoigu, which included 14 additional divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results from the DIEM Analytics model show a slightly different pattern. There is no obvious relationship between Russian defence investments and the degree to which long-range strike is discussed in Russian military literature. Investments in long-range strike (in terms of ground forces that can operate in the close battle) appear to correspond with periods in which Russia has engaged in low-intensity fighting. This could reflect two possibilities. First, long-range strike is viewed as a means of cost saving, much in the way that nuclear weapons sometimes were during the Soviet era (for example, during the Khrushchev era, when the need for nuclear weapons was used as a basis for reducing conventional forces). Whenever a greater desire to focus on small-scale operations at reach has characterised Soviet and Russian thinking, this has typically led to attempts to deter through an economy of force effort in the European theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second possibility is that Russia views adversary long-range strike as part of a single problem set alongside low-intensity “local wars” on its periphery. This latter view is best captured in an article co-authored by V Selivanov, a senior academic at the Russian Academy of Rocket and Artillery Sciences, which postulates that the threat of long-range strike represents a means of paralysing Russia’s response to local conflicts on its periphery with states aligned with or allied to the US, and of setting the conditions for Russia’s own allies worldwide to be supplanted. In this context, the balance of long-range strike capabilities is the basis for strategic freedom of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-shifts-in-russian-thinking-about-precision-strike-and-force-design&quot;&gt;Potential Shifts in Russian Thinking about Precision Strike and Force Design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the large-scale conflict in Ukraine, Russia might re-envision its approach to force design, emphasising a more traditional mass-based force model, comparable to the one outlined by Shoigu – and this is what the DIEM Analytics model suggests. This in turn would imply a greater emphasis on the close fight, an assumption that the capacity to win a protracted conflict (rather than triumph in short, sharp wars) is critical, and a relative de-emphasising of the importance of deep strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this depends on the lessons Russia learns from the Ukraine conflict and on its view of how Allied forces are modernising. At the time of writing, Russian publications produced since the conflict in Ukraine began still place considerable emphasis on non-contact warfare, and it is not clear that the Russian military views the Ukrainian conflict as a template for the type of force design needed to confront NATO (as opposed to a large but local conflict where NATO’s major contribution to Ukraine has been the provision of standoff capabilities and ISR). A continuation of pre-existing assumptions would not be surprising, since institutionalised views are resistant to change, except in periods of acute crisis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia can be induced to re-emphasise fighting the deep battle at the expense of other capabilities, this is not without its own challenges for NATO, which currently faces considerable shortfalls in IAMD capabilities, particularly if American systems (which will likely be in considerable demand in the Pacific) are unavailable in large numbers. Russia has a competitive strategy of its own here. The threat of a Russian SODCIT (strategic operation to destroy critically important targets) could drive Allied investments in air and missile defence for both civilian and military targets, which could easily prove unaffordable. This would, moreover, impose the same opportunity costs as those Russia could be forced to face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, then, the successful side will be the one that invests in deep strike and IAMD in ways that minimise its opportunity costs and maximise those of the opponent, rather than the side which generates enough capacity to “win” in strictly military terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are fundamental asymmetries between the challenges that NATO members and the Russian military will face when they consider the defence of their operational rear areas and their defence at strategic depth. It should be noted that, conceptually, this distinction is somewhat less clear for NATO than it is for Russia: for frontline states on the Alliance’s eastern flank, the two categories overlap almost entirely. However, a subdivision of threats into range categories and an effort to keep critical capabilities beyond the reach of more numerous short-ranged threats, where possible, will probably characterise Alliance planning as well. In light of this, this paper uses this range-based terminology, despite the fact that it does not overlap entirely with the doctrinal lexicon of the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For NATO, capacity in areas such as GBAD (and interceptor stockpiles more broadly) represents a challenge. Moreover, the structure of NATO’s IAMD architecture, in which Allies allocate national resources to an Alliance-level C2 structure, is an additional limiting factor. This having been said, the expenditure of air defence interceptors in the context of Ukraine is an imperfect proxy for the Alliance’s requirements, insofar as the temporal window within which an IAMD capability must be at its most effective is determined by the duration of an Allied SEAD campaign (rather than being an open-ended commitment). Once Russian air defences had been suppressed, the launch platforms for missiles would become significantly more vulnerable. As such, from a purely military standpoint, the Alliance should not face an open-ended air defence commitment in the way Ukraine has – it needs to defend critical targets such as airbases for long enough to ensure that a SEAD campaign succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as discussed below, the interceptor expenditure in this more limited context will be considerable, and Russia’s chosen approach can complicate this challenge. It is likely that Russia intends to combine early attacks to suppress Allied airpower with a SODCIT aimed at NATO infrastructure. The demands of defending both civilian and military infrastructure could quickly become unsustainable, and could draw surface-based systems from more militarily critical missions. Ensuring that this occurs would be Russia’s best competitive strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, NATO members can, collectively, field considerably more air assets than the VKS, and the platforms fielded are generally technically superior to their Russian counterparts. Indeed, it is this asymmetry that has driven the Russian focus on ground-based SAM systems, which, while not unsophisticated, are considerably less complex than aircraft, and which in a defensive role provide much less coverage. For example, at the time of writing, to maintain persistent MIG-31BM orbits in Ukraine without adequate tanker support, the VKS has had to mount 96 sorties a day – effectively employing a significant portion of Russia’s MIG-31BM fleet in a comparatively small theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mobility of air-based systems allows them to close off larger channels with smaller numbers of systems in aggregate compared with GBAD capabilities, and can enable intercepts with comparatively short-ranged interceptors. However, three factors will affect the Alliance. The first will be the degree to which airpower can be deployed in a contested and denied environment. For NATO as a collective, for example, the FLOT and areas at least up to corps depth (90 km) will (in the initial stages of a conflict) be locations where all but fifth-generation aircraft will operate at risk, creating a greater demand for ground-based systems in these areas. Second, the ability of aircraft to operate from airbases close to the Alliance’s eastern flank will to some extent be contested by Russian long-range precision fires. For example, Iskander SRBMs operating from Kaliningrad and Belarus can cover much of Poland. Beyond this point, airbases remain vulnerable to suppression, although this would require Russia to place high-value platforms such as bombers and guided-missile submarines at risk, since firing cruise missiles (Russia’s primary option for suppressing airbases at theatre depth) at their maximum ranges restricts their manoeuvrability and provides defenders with ample warning time. Consider, for example, Russia’s failure to suppress the Ukrainian air force’s 7th Air Brigade, which operates Storm Shadow missiles, despite multiple strikes on its western airbase of Starokostyantyniv. The distances Russian cruise missiles need to traverse to reach western Ukraine mean that their targets are typically able to disperse ahead of the strike’s arrival. There are, however, supporting capabilities that are harder to move, such as autonomic logistics information system terminals and mission programming computers, so the threat to air assets remains. Moreover, a Russian IRBM capability, such as the RS-26 Rubezh, will substantially increase the challenge of airbase defence at depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, since aircraft are inherently multirole systems, they will be drawn between multiple tasks, with defensive counter air (DCA), as a matter of convention, being allocated 35–40% of available airpower in the first five days of a conflict. Any growth in this requirement, or the allocation of this proportion of Allied airpower for longer periods, will have considerable knock-on effects on planning for other tasks such as offensive counter air (OCA) and SEAD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second facet of defensive operations which must be considered is that layering can only be achieved over limited areas. While the mobility of airpower can allow for zonal defence of wide areas, it is likely that the ground-based systems needed for ballistic missile defence (BMD) will need to be prioritised. This will probably result in politically difficult trade-offs between defending critical military facilities (against which it is likely that ballistic missiles will be used) and civilian infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;optimising-capability-laydown&quot;&gt;Optimising Capability Laydown&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To examine the question of what the most efficient capability laydown for NATO’s Area of Responsibility (AOR) might look like (with efficiency defined as limiting interceptor expenditure to the greatest extent possible), the authors ran a 1,000-run Monte Carlo simulation to examine the various force laydowns that could be achieved in the Allied AOR. The assumptions underpinning the model were that the coverage of aircraft roughly corresponds to that achieved in the context of the April 2024 Iranian attack on Israel, and that the single shot probability of kill (SSPK) of individual interceptors across category types was 0.8 (based on the test standard demanded of US and Allied systems). It is also assumed that three intercept attempts per object are required in the final defensive layer (assuming a ripple firing shot doctrine) and that one intercept can be attempted in the first layer for both BMD and intercepts of air-breathing threats. The function for assessing the number of interceptors allocated to each layer isx + dqx, where d is the number of intercepts required in the second layer and x the number in the first. It is presumed that the coverage of the first (airborne) layer of air defence considerably exceeds the second (by a factor of 5:1). The availability of aircraft is presumed to vary by up to 50% (to account for both readiness and the effects of suppression) and their ability to patrol 100 km from the FLOT is presumed to not exist, since all but fifth-generation aircraft are likely to be unable to do so freely in the early days of a conflict. The composition of the Russian missile threat is based on the first two months of the conflict in Ukraine, as well as on the two most intensive periods of bombardment in 2023–24. BMD interceptors are subdivided into longer-ranged interceptors, such as Aster-301NT, and dual-use hit-to-kill interceptors, such as PAC-3. Running a simulation based on these (admittedly very simplified) assumptions yielded the results shown in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/V6r0naV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Ratio of Different Interceptor Types Used&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages that NATO enjoys in the air mitigate (but do not eliminate) the requirement for a large number of surface-based BMD-capable interceptors, and the number of squadrons committed to DCA in this context represents a considerable portion of Allied airpower (although the proportion of airpower this represents becomes far smaller if the readiness of Allied aircraft increases). Notably, despite the fact that air intercept accounts for a considerable portion of the overall interceptions achieved, a comparable number of GBAD interceptors and a proportionately larger number of BMD interceptors are still required. This could reflect the fact that IAMD closer to the FLOT has to be provided by surface-based systems, and that the variable availability of aircraft must be accounted for. Moreover, all BMD is presumed to be surface-based. It is also of note that the shoot-look-shoot approach to surface-based BMD presumes long-range radar comparable to the AN/TPY-2 or the Green Pine, which can track quasi-ballistic threats but which do not exist in large numbers within the Alliance. Where such radar do exist (for example, as part of the NATO BMD system), they are not integrated with the IAMD mission, for policy reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, if a higher availability of aircraft is presumed, the results are effectively inverted, and considerably fewer squadrons are allocated to DCA, as illustrated in Table 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/axWDdHG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Ratio of Different Interceptor Types Used Assuming Higher Aircraft Availability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has several implications. First, it might reasonably be presumed that NATO airpower considerably mitigates the effect of lower availability of surface-based defensive systems. This presumes, however, that sufficient early warning and point defences are available to ensure a higher number of available of airframes, particularly in the context of a significant ballistic missile threat. Second, the Monte Carlo runs assume a rate of interception that can only be achieved if aircraft are equipped with up-to-date radar (such as the AESA radar, which is due to be fitted to the UK’s Typhoon fleet) and enabled by AWACS or long-range early warning radar. Third, AWACS themselves will face unacceptable risks until the IADS in Kaliningrad is suppressed, since systems such as the S-400 can operate at their maximum ranges against high-flying targets. This in turn would imply that the requirement for surface-based systems closer to the frontline will be considerable; any nationally driven reallocation of these assets to defend civilian targets could prove dangerous. Equally, national or multinational efforts to deliver defences against the Russian missile threat to both civilian and military targets across the theatre could quickly prove prohibitively costly (given the costs of defending critical military targets) and would impose opportunity costs elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key deduction from the results might be that the adequate enablement of airborne DCA capabilities represents the fastest and cheapest way for NATO to mitigate the air threat (as presently constituted) beyond distances of 500 km, while surface-based capabilities should be prioritised for the defence of forces (rather than of CNI) in the early stages of a conflict, given that the areas in which deployed forces operate will see the greatest demand for surface-based air and missile defences (in view of the difficulty of flying many air assets in these areas), and the unaffordability of generating layered defences for both the frontline and rear areas. Several pathways to achieving this suggest themselves, including role specialisation among states that do not operate large numbers of fifth-generation aircraft (and which will therefore not operate within an IADS early in a conflict).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alliance can considerably reduce the strain on interceptor stockpiles by both ensuring aircraft readiness and allocating limited GBAD capabilities to force protection. This does not reduce the strain of surface-based ballistic missile defence, which is invariant, but Russia is likely to have limited numbers of ballistic missiles (which represent no more than 13% of Russian missiles used in Ukraine), and most Russian ballistic missiles will have tactical ranges for the short to medium term. It does, however, presume the availability of AWACS support and of suitable aircraft that can distinguish between elusive targets in clutter. The latter represents a capability gap in many Allied air forces, including the RAF, which is yet to upgrade the radar on its fourth-generation Typhoon aircraft to AESA radar. Equally, an increase in either the volume or range of the Russian ballistic threat can considerably increase the strain on both first-layer surface-based BMD systems (which, outside the maritime domain, are entirely American) and dual-capable systems such as PAC-3. Moreover, the number of interceptors expended for BMD missions increases eightfold in the absence of longer-range surface-based radar such as the AN/TPY-2. Notably, Allied BMD radar, such as the SPY-1 systems in Poland and Romania, can already play this role, but do not do so (for policy rather than technical reasons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulties faced employing AWACS in locations such as Poland can potentially be offset through the employment of other elevated sensors, which can serve as a stand-in until the suppression of Kaliningrad. An example might be the use of elevated sensors on aerostats, which was pursued under the JLENS programme (a tethered aerial detection system, with demonstrated effectiveness – its major challenge was the tethers, not sensor fidelity). As such, the outcome of an effort to suppress Kaliningrad will also have considerable effects for the deep battle, and not just for operations in a theatre such as the Baltic states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that, past the early stages of a conflict, Russia will face its own challenges, since many of the launch platforms on which its deep-strike capabilities depend are either non-survivable (such as surface vessels) or relatively limited in number. Russia’s bomber fleet, for example, would operate at some risk on NATO’s northern flank once a maritime component command was set up. This might be less of a challenge when striking civilian infrastructure (which can be engaged at the limits of a missile’s range from within Russian airspace), but against time-sensitive or defended targets, cruise missiles need to be fired at ranges which leave spare fuel capacity for the missile to manoeuvre, while ballistic missiles need to be fired on energy-efficient trajectories – all of which requires bomber personnel to place themselves at risk. Russia can, of course, mitigate this risk through a greater reliance on ground launchers, although this introduces its own challenges: soft-skinned TELs need to be distributed from their operating bases early to avoid suppression, which can rob a force of early operational surprise and complicate communication and the coordination of salvos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO members thus face relative challenges in terms of capacity, but these can be mitigated through an effort to better leverage airborne sensors and effectors and by a level of prioritisation that eschews efforts to deliver unachievable levels of magazine depth. In the early stages of a campaign, NATO’s primary risks will emerge from the potential suppression of airbases – suggesting a rationalisation of GBAD capabilities is necessary to prioritise this function. Over time, the risk to a broader target set will grow, but if the IADS in Kaliningrad is suppressed, airborne sensors that allow the risk to be more readily mitigated can be employed. The need for elevated sensors that can be employed during the period in which AWACS cannot be easily used will require individual Allies to invest more heavily in alternative elevated sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-geography-and-the-growing-cost-of-integrated-air-and-missile-defence&quot;&gt;Russia’s Geography and the Growing Cost of Integrated Air and Missile Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the offensive side of the ledger, several asymmetries will pose conundrums for Russia in addition to ISR advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first challenge that Russia will face is that the changing territorial extent of the Alliance makes the distinction between “tactical-operational” and “operational-strategic” missiles, which the Russian military has historically used in its lexicon, less clear cut. From Finland, for example, an SRBM such as the precision-strike missile can reach a number of targets that the Russians would dub “strategic”, such as Severomorsk and Olenya Guba. Many of these systems can be launched from otherwise “tactical” systems such as HIMARS and M270. While Russia does not lack air-defence systems (although its BMD capabilities are more limited), uncertainty regarding adversary targeting will impose complications Russia has not faced in Ukraine, where there has been less of a problem deciding whether to allocate capabilities at tactical or strategic depth since, barring intermittent UAV attacks, there has been only a marginal threat at strategic depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia may face specific challenges with respect to defending against ballistic missiles. Even though BMD has been viewed as a core function for the S-300V series and a role for the S-400, it is notable that neither is especially effective in this role. In the case of the S-400 it is likely that the seekers on the 40N6 and 9M96 do not operate at a frequency higher than Ku band. The decision to opt for a blast fragmentation solution and a Ku band-seeker imposes costs with respect to the BMD mission compared with higher-frequency Ka band-seekers. The higher the frequency of a seeker, the lower its position error and the greater the granularity of its returns, which enables the use of more reliable hit-to-kill interceptors. The use of a solution comparable to the PAC-2 GEM-T could reflect a decision to focus on air-breathing targets, but may also reflect either challenges with seeker design or the fact that the Elbrus-800 computer on the S-400 is slower to process the trajectory of fast-moving targets. In the latter case, a lower-frequency (and thus longer-ranged) seeker tends to be required to scan a wider area, since the difference between the estimated and real location of a target is likely to be greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it cannot be ascertained with certainty which of these hypotheses is correct, it is of note that experts with prior experience of Russian and Soviet SAM systems have suggested that these systems have historically faced challenges with processing speed and overheating. Importantly, newer Russian systems, such as the S-500, will carry a hit-to-kill BMD capability in the form of the 77N-6. The A-235 interceptor, fielded as part of the Moscow BMD system, will also carry a hit-to-kill interceptor. As such, the window of vulnerability to ballistic missiles could be closing, although this would require Russia to procure both systems and interceptors at scale, adding additional strains to an already heavily burdened complex weapons pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intersection of geography and BMD is important here, since systems such as the A-235 and S-500 were procured with a view to defence against more limited numbers of intermediate- and long-range ballistic missiles. In the present operating environment, Russia will face a dual challenge against air- or surface-launched SRBMs: its IADS performs poorly against ballistic targets, and its loss of strategic depth will make it difficult to ascertain whether SRBMs are being used tactically or strategically. This being said, NATO members field relatively few tactical ballistic missiles, although this may change with the prospective purchase of both ground- and air-launched systems by several member states. Russia does have other options for tactical BMD, such as the S-300 V4, but the X-band seeker on the 9M82 likely provides limited granularity (which is traded for range) and a lower integration rate for returns, which potentially explains the modest claim of 0.5 probability of kill against tactical ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, defence against low-flying targets such as UAVs and cruise missiles is at least partially dependent on more limited numbers of airborne enablers, such as AWACS and interceptor aircraft like the MIG-31BM. A defence against low-flying objects can still be prosecuted without these capabilities, but at a cost in terms of the warning times available to ground-based systems. This can be overcome by layering short- and longer-ranged systems to create overlapping zones of radar coverage, even though this represents a relatively inefficient means of employing systems that are likely to be needed elsewhere. Moreover, airborne systems are more visible – and thus more vulnerable to suppression – than ground-based TELs. Air defence is possible without an over-reliance on airborne assets but, as discussed, this is a resource-intensive task for ground-based systems, which Russian forces will need near the FLOT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, emerging capabilities such as hypersonic weapons are likely to pose a considerable challenge for Russia’s IADS, which currently lacks the means for the (comparatively) simple task of exoatmospheric BMD. The challenge perceived by many Russian authors is that hypersonic weapons would act as a breaching capability to set the conditions for the use of slower cruise missiles, fixed-wing aircraft and UAVs. Russia is certainly not alone in this analysis. The space-based sensor layer needed to enable birth-to-death tracking of hypersonic projectiles, as well as glide phase interceptors, probably exceeds the capacity of most states, bar the US (and potentially China in the future). Moreover, no NATO member other than the US is likely to field hypersonic missiles in the foreseeable future (given the costs and lead times involved), although the US will field the US Army’s Dark Eagle long-range hypersonic weapon in Europe under the 2nd Multi-Domain Task Force. It might be plausibly argued that the limited numbers and high costs of any hypersonic system in Europe will necessarily narrow the target set against which it can be used to a limited number of possible alternatives, and that the provision of localised defence of key targets (for example, national C2 nodes) is in some ways easier against hypersonic glide vehicles than against comparably ranged ballistic missiles (which are typically faster in their terminal phase).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the presence of hypersonic weapons in Europe would pose a broader question to Russia: how interceptors are allocated. Systems such as the S-500 are allegedly being developed for full spectrum counter-air operations combining new interceptors such as the 77N6-N and 77N6N-1 as well as older interceptors such as the 9M96 and 40N6 – with the system fielding 10 interceptor types in total. However, any given system can only be loaded with a finite number of any type of interceptor. Even if it were assumed that, for example, the 77N6 series is capable of intercepting hypersonic projectiles, it will defend areas that can be simultaneously targeted by SRBMs and cruise missiles, even at what would previously have been regarded as strategic depth. Of course, this challenge can be overcome by layering – allocating the tasks of air defence and tactical BMD to systems such as the S-300V4 and S-400 (as well as shorter-ranged systems) – but this negates the emphasis on multifunctionality, which was meant to ensure that the S-500 did not have to operate with large numbers of accompanying systems as part of a multi-system IADS in which it draws heavily on other systems for self-protection. Furthermore, it is not obvious that the 77N6 series – apparently an updated version of the 9M82 anti-ballistic missile, which did not eventually receive a hit-to-kill warhead – will live up to claims made of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, Russia can defend key points against theatre-range missiles, but must either layer shorter-ranged defences around the S-500 to achieve this effect or risk the saturation of these systems by cheaper tactical missiles. Furthermore, the results from the Monte Carlo model show that even small numbers of tactical ballistic missiles can impose prohibitive costs on a single-layer defensive system (eliminating 65 SRBMs requires the expenditure of 624 interceptors, assuming an SSPK of 0.5, for example). Given this, employing longer-ranged interceptors may not be discretionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia’s Dilemma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian military, then, faces a very specific problem. Its lack of depth would appear to incentivise a force structure built to ensure high readiness and high levels of force protection for both rear areas and frontline units. However, its planned force design would imply the need for a larger force, probably including partially formed “skeleton units”, which would need to be augmented by conscripts in a crisis – a time-consuming process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the greater the requirement for organic force protection, the harder it becomes to adequately protect any element of the force structure in a cost-effective way. In effect, despite the implied lessons that Russia is learning, as forecast by both the DIEM Analytics model and its own planned force design, the need to offset the risks posed by Western precision-strike capabilities would drive it in a different direction, closer in form to the smaller but more heavily equipped force envisioned under the Serdyukov reforms. In effect, then, deep-strike capabilities can impact Russia’s capacity to build a force around an attritional approach intended to leverage superior combat mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia will also have to choose between the defence of rear areas and frontline forces; and much of its military literature, as discussed, emphasises the former. As a consequence, Russian efforts to defend rear areas can simplify the task of SEAD near the FLOT and thus make the employment of NATO airpower easier (but by no means easy). Relatively short-ranged strike capabilities, then, can serve as an important enabler for NATO airpower – the Alliance’s optimal competitive strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat is currently somewhat notional for Russia. European NATO members field relatively limited surface-to-surface fires capabilities and theatre missiles (with the exception of maritime strike capabilities, such as the Tomahawk land attack missile). However, European states collectively field 3,000 air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) in the 500-km range (although the combat readiness of these missiles is not uniform, and donations to Ukraine have likely impacted stockpiles). Of course, ALCMs will need to be launched at distances that account for the IADS threat, but to pose this threat across an extended frontline, Russia would need to thin out its IADS in ways that affected the defences allocated to its forces at the FLOT. Moreover, the purchase of SRBMs (such as ATACMS) and precision-strike missiles by a number of European countries, including the UK, Poland and the Baltic states, will alter the surface-to-surface threat environment considerably. This is not to suggest that a formidable European strike capability is necessarily on the horizon. Rather, the major deduction is that, in tandem with limited numbers of capabilities that only the US can produce, increases in European stocks of existing relatively short-ranged ballistic and cruise missiles can have a strategic effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-balance-of-isrcounter-isr-capabilities&quot;&gt;The Balance of ISR/Counter-ISR Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the previous sections suggest, defensive capacity will be a challenge for both Russia and the Alliance, although it is likely that the challenge will compound for Russia over time. While both parties have incentives to win the fight for information, Russia has an especially strong rationale for denying NATO a level of situational awareness that Russia itself is unlikely to be able to generate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AWACS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the Alliance has a relative – albeit fragile – ISR advantage both in the air and in space. NATO’s Airborne Early Warning capability is currently in transition. Existing AWACS are being phased out, with some improvements taking place until 2035, when the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control (AFSC) programme comes into place. AFSC is intended to deliver a “system of systems” as part of the wider multi-domain operations effort, drawing on novel capabilities such as AI and uncrewed systems. For now, a limited Allied fleet of 14 Boeing 707 AWACS aircraft is stationed in Geilenkirchen Air Base in Germany. Its maintenance is a continuing problem, while the operational number is decreasing. While AWACS will see upgrades in the meantime, such as to its communication system, the airframe, cited as the “biggest liability concern”, will not be upgraded. This could be an area of vulnerability, which could be partly mitigated simply by having more maintenance personnel and higher availability of necessary resources – some aircraft are reportedly being cannibalised for parts to fix better-maintained aircraft in the fleet. Individual NATO members will, of course, make national contributions in an Article 5 context. However, the risks faced by AWACS near Kaliningrad, and the fact that surface-based IAMD assets cannot process radar tracks from AWACS across the Alliance (and in many cases within countries), pose significant challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Assets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of space-based reconnaissance, there are several sovereign systems that can be relied on, including the French CERES (Capacité de Renseignement Électromagnétique Spatiale) satellite constellation, but this represents a federated architecture, rather than an integrated one across which data can easily be shared. NATO is also building a digital constellation, “Aquila”, which is set to benefit from both sovereign space-based ISR capabilities and commercial capabilities, thereby enabling the Alliance to make use of a growing private sector, especially in Luxembourg. While several countries in Europe rely on the space-based ISR capabilities of the US, in the absence of sovereign assets, capabilities are currently being developed and invested in to reduce this dependency; the British ISR constellation ISTARI, for example, was launched in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, there is a patchwork of different systems that can provide reliable reconnaissance from space, and which can be tasked at short notice. Presently, the US has the most comprehensive constellation, as the success of Aquila proves in terms of information sharing. More broadly, the processes involved in disseminating information pose a challenge. The sharing of information, especially when classified, has often been difficult, even among NATO Allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine, however, has demonstrated how, in an emergency, red tape can be cut and information can be made available. This is especially true given the ability to access commercial capability – for example, the satellite imagery that the US has been able to provide to the Ukrainians. To facilitate this, the US “doubled the commercial electro-optical imagery” over Ukraine and increased its “purchasing power fivefold”, in addition to passing on data gathered from more sensitive assets via US headquarters. The question is whether the lessons learned from such emergency situations can now be applied to make routine processes smoother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Earth observation (EO) and intelligence constellations cannot be compared to the combined Allied capabilities – most Russian assets in orbit are past their expected life expectancy, with limited prospects for replacement. This is especially true in comparison with the commercial offerings that NATO Allies can draw from, where new sensors are being deployed constantly. The fact that Russia relies on satellite imagery, but cannot solely rely on its own assets, is evidenced by Russia having bought satellite imagery on the global market since April 2022. Most commercial providers of imagery are Western, a point noted by Russian authors, and this supply chain may become subject to further restrictions, which might target Russia’s future access to imagery. The fact that the Chinese satellite technology company Spacety was sanctioned for allegedly providing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to the Wagner Group may suggest that Russia can – in part at least – also rely on Chinese EO capabilities, which are considerable: figures from 2022 show that China has more than eight times as many remote sensing assets as Russia (262, compared with Russia’s 32). Chinese assets, though, are likely to be positioned primarily to surveil China’s zone of interest: the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterspace capabilities are thus likely to be an integral part of the Russian arsenal. This is not new; as a number of authors in journals such as Voennaya Mysl have pointed out, Soviet planning for defeating an aerospace attack also included a heavy emphasis on counterspace operations, and the decision to combine air and space functions under the VKS was primarily driven by the assumption that counterspace operations are inextricable from the deflection of massed aerospace attacks. In particular, Russia has placed great emphasis on its EW capabilities, which can interfere directly with the navigation of precision weapons. In Russian military thinking, EW is considered critical to “force multipliers”, and a firm component of Russia’s asymmetric challenge. There is further evidence that Russia might be developing a space-based jammer satellite (Ekipazh) in addition to its ground-based capabilities. Given the nuclear reactor the satellite is supposed to possess, this asset would allow Russia to continuously jam satellites, and on a wide-reaching basis, as the power source is unlimited and the curvature of the Earth cannot interfere with the range of the signals, as it would on the ground. In terms of the physics, the Earth’s curvature will not obstruct a jamming signal, but that signal must still have sufficient power to block out the power of the signal that the targeted satellite is receiving. The effective radiated power (ERP) of a jamming signal diminishes the further that signal has to travel, meaning it may become ineffective if the targeted satellite is far enough away from the jamming satellite. The jamming satellite could be moved closer to the targeted satellite, but this could expend valuable fuel. Moreover, the ERP of the jamming signal will be limited by the power that the reactor can generate, while also needing to power the jamming satellite’s other signals. In a nutshell, a jamming satellite’s effectiveness would still be constrained by the ERP it can generate and by its proximity to the targeted satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it should be noted that there is no concrete evidence to suggest that Ekipazh has entered plans for operational deployment, the fielding of such a capability would represent a logical step for Russia, meaning that the question of how communications might be made more resilient remains germane. It is claimed that ground-based EW systems such as the Krasukha-4 and the Murmansk-BN are effective against SAR satellites, although the rate at which Ukraine’s partners have been able to provide Ukraine with data is grounds for some conservatism in assessing the effectiveness of Russian EW in a counterspace role. It seems that further systems are being developed – including an EW system that could prevent optical and radar reconnaissance satellites from imaging by preventing their signals from reaching the relay satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Counterspace Weapons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also has an arsenal of kinetic counterspace weapons, for example, the ground-launched ballistic missile Nudol, which was successfully tested in November 2021. Russian BMD interceptors such as the A-235 are also dual-hatted as kinetic anti-satellite weapons. Additionally, Russia employs the Soviet-era 78M6 Kontakt on the Mig-31 interceptor. However, it is unlikely that Russia would make use of its kinetic counterspace arsenal, and especially not in the initial phases of a war. This is because the number of assets that would need to be targeted would effectively render the affected orbit unusable – including for Russian assets. This calculation is particularly important when considering that Russian long-range weapons also rely on satellite guidance – both from GPS and from GLONASS, the Russian GNSS (global navigation satellite service).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also been developing directed-energy countermeasures against space-based reconnaissance assets for some time, although there is some uncertainty regarding the specifications of emerging systems. One of these systems might be Peresvet, a laser system announced in 2018, which was reportedly designed to prevent the space-based detection of mobile ICBMs. If targeted by Peresvet, the reconnaissance satellite is temporarily dazzled. Furthermore, Russia’s ground-based satellite laser ranging facilities could, in theory, be used for the same purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Russia’s Krona optical space surveillance systems might be being outfitted with dazzling or blinding capabilities, according to open source investigations that discovered bank guarantees and other reports. There have been conflicting reports about the 1LK222, a laser system attached to an aircraft (as yet unnamed), which would be designed to specifically counter the infrared spectrum – it is currently unclear whether the programme has been cancelled by Russia’s Ministry of Defence. The current evidence of Russia’s laser development is somewhat patchy – but there is precedent for these developments, and the evidence emerging seems to suggest that several lines of effort are being dedicated to the temporary dazzling of optical sensors aboard satellites. However, it is unclear how many of these systems, if any, are fully operational, and whether they would be able to serve the purpose of concealing mobile launcher systems consistently, and at a scale that would bring Russia a genuine advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Limits of Counterspace Capabilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterspace operations could provide Russia with a cheap means of avoiding an otherwise unwinnable race to develop both air defences and precision-strike capabilities, given its loss of strategic depth and the aggregate force balance. However, there are limits to the effectiveness of counterspace capabilities. This is particularly true with respect to kinetic kill vehicles such as Nudol, which create considerable amounts of debris and are thus an indiscriminate tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attacks at scale with relatively indiscriminate capabilities would necessarily run counter to the aim of fighting a limited war in the service of political aims. While such attacks are more conceivable in the context of a larger-scale conflict, in which second-order effects are less of a consideration, a total conflict is unlikely to be consistent with wider Russian strategic aims. Russia’s non-kinetic options, such as space-based EW and long-range jammers, including the Murmansk-BN, represent a more strategically credible capability. However, the reliability of these systems is open to debate, given Russia’s inability to deny Ukrainian satellite communications and the difficulties Russia has faced in denying Ukraine’s allies the ability to provide it with data from electronic intelligence soaks. The growing diversification of the space-based ISR assets ecosystem, alongside the increasing use of multiple frequencies (including Ka band for communication), mean that ISR and communications disruption on a sustained basis will be increasingly difficult to guarantee with soft kill alone. Much depends on Allied efforts to generate resilience. Russian authors have devoted considerable attention to the possibility of kinetic attacks on ground stations, although a combination of hardening and IAMD can mitigate this risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of technical solutions to the challenge of counterspace capabilities, including frequency hopping, shuttering satellites and adaptive nulling (ignoring parts of the frequency spectrum an opponent is jamming). Millimetre wave communications can also prove highly resistant to jamming – one of the factors to which the Russians attribute Starlink’s success. However, it must be presumed that both ISR and positioning, navigation and timing will be intermittently disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EW capabilities, including the R770 Zhitl, the Krashuka-3 and the Murmansk-BN, can also be employed against the effector rather than the ISR complex, and EW platforms can be employed to jam radio frequency communications and GPS signals. However, this will probably have greater effect against stand-in munitions, such as JDAM, than against standoff capabilities, which combine GPS with terrain contour matching and digital scene mapping area correlation. In effect, Russia has better options for cost-effective defence in the close area than it does at the army deep and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is of greater significance for intermediate target development than for weapons guidance. Western weapons systems might be affected by GNSS jamming or spoofing, although many of them do have fallback options in case of interference. Storm Shadow/SCALP-EG relies on three elements: GPS, INS (inertial navigation system) and terrain referencing, with an infrared seeker for the target approach. Taurus KEPD 350 uses GPS and INS with image-based and terrain reference sensors; its manufacturers consider the weapon “GPS-independent”. The US Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile uses GPS, INS and an infrared seeker for target guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordinating a counterspace campaign would also pose challenges for Russia, however. First, the capabilities on which such a campaign depends are expensive and, in some cases, reliant on foreign inputs that can be constrained. Moreover, space-based observation and early warning is of importance to Russia as well, and Russian planners cannot be insouciant about the consequences of a kinetic attack on satellites with which their own early warning systems share orbits. In addition, NATO members can also engage in “strategic binding”, intertwining capabilities either within or across nations in ways that make selective attacks more difficult. For example, EO satellites in geosynchronous orbit (comparable to China’s Yaogan-41) would cohabit an area with early warning systems such as SBIRS, making them more difficult to strike with kinetic capabilities without producing unpredictable effects; this would also have the advantage of providing angles for observing hypersonics, which can otherwise be obscured by thermal clutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, then, there would be limits to any Russian effort to use counterspace and counter-ISR capabilities to mitigate the challenge of having to resource a layered defence against deep-strike capabilities while protecting frontline forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;allied-counter-c4isr&quot;&gt;Allied Counter-C4ISR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of Western countermeasures in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS), it must be assumed that Europe will continue to rely on US systems. US predominance in the field is best represented by the Navigation Warfare Program, which enables the US to jam and interfere with civilian GNSS signals within a local area of operation – a capability that has already been demonstrated in exercises. It is also likely to be able to jam military GNSS receivers, especially given the money and time spent on EW capabilities. It is, however, difficult to determine from open sources how effective US systems would be in counteracting the jamming or spoofing of military GPS signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture in Europe is more mixed: while France has incorporated GNSS jamming in its Exercise Black Crow 24, it has been observed that the UK trains its troops in unrealistically permissive environments when it comes to the EMS, which may also be the case for other NATO members. Given US predominance in terms of systems available and its experience, there is likely to be a dependence on US systems in Europe if they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian missiles depend on GNSS signals to varying degrees. Similarly to Western missiles, they rely on different factors, including INS and DSMAC (digital scene matching area correlator). As the stockpile of precision-guided missiles dwindles, not only older missiles but also missiles with different intended purposes have been used for land attacks. It is not inconceivable that Russia would adopt tactics from the Ukraine war, including using anti-ship and air defence missiles for land attacks, specifically where the intention is to terrorise the civilian population, with no intention of carrying out a precision strike. Among the modern variants, the air-launched K-101/Kh-102 used in Ukraine rely on the GLONASS constellation, TV terminal guidance, an electro-optical correction system with terrain maps, and INS. It is not entirely clear which navigation mechanisms are used by the ground-launched 9M729 (SSC-8), but its predecessor, the 9K720 Iskander (SS-26), employs inertial guidance, GLONASS, an optional optical seeker (which also uses DSMAC), and a terminal guidance system. Unlike GLONASS or GPS, INS cannot be jammed, but it needs to be supplemented by further systems to keep the flight path accurate, as it otherwise accrues error over time. Meanwhile, the Shahed-136, one of the most heavily used UAVs during the war, has INS in addition to its GPS system, and employs preset target coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general terms, both Russia and the West use deep-strike systems that would be vulnerable to electronic interference. Russia’s advantage lies in the testing of systems during the war in Ukraine, including the patching of vulnerabilities. On the other hand, the GLONASS constellation that is still built into a variety of strike capabilities is more volatile than GPS – not only was deployment of its newest generation of satellites delayed, thereby holding back the update to the system, but also Russian fighter pilots were seen to attach civilian GPS systems to their cockpit instrumentation, which does not inspire confidence in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;escalatory-dimensions-of-a-strike-campaign&quot;&gt;Escalatory Dimensions of a Strike Campaign&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second relatively cost-effective offset available to Russia to counter opponents’ deep-strike capabilities is the threat to employ sub-strategic nuclear weapons, which would be consistent with Russian nuclear doctrine and recent statements regarding likely revisions. In practice, the threat of a large-scale employment of sub-strategic nuclear weapons could deter a massed air assault on Russia. Making this threat credible would, however, require the mobilisation of Russia’s nuclear arsenal and the placement of tactical nuclear weapons on a hair-trigger warning to account for the effects of C2 disruption. This, in turn, would make the prospect of limited conflict difficult to contemplate – the mechanisms to signal limited intent being effectively removed as a prerequisite for Russian war planning in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat to employ sub-strategic nuclear weapons in response to a massed conventional air assault also has implications for Russia’s own concepts for deflecting Allied airpower through the massed use of long-range precision fires. Employing long-range precision fires carries the implicit risk of a response in kind, and by extension the possibility of placing Russia in a position where it must either escalate or invalidate its own deterrent threats. In effect, the threat to employ nuclear weapons as a deterrent against long-range precision fires also constrains Russia’s own capacity to employ precision-strike capabilities. This has ramifications for the close fight, in which Russia’s ability to limit Allied sortie rates (and thus the effectiveness of a SEAD campaign) partly depends on its ability to hold airbases at risk with long-range precision fires. In practice, a change in Russian nuclear thresholds could constrain critical Russian capabilities as much as it does Western ones – or even more so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aggressive counter-ISR campaign represents a less escalatory alternative for Russia, particularly if it employs non-kinetic assets. While unlikely to prevent the employment of Allied precision-strike capabilities entirely, such an approach could impact tempo and coordination. The major challenge to a counter-ISR campaign is relative uncertainty about its likely effects – a dynamic best illustrated by the limited effects of Russian counter-ISR in Ukraine. More “brute force” approaches, such as kinetic air-launched anti-satellite missiles, obviate this challenge, but at the risk of incurring wider political costs (since many states’ capabilities are likely to be affected) and capital costs, as a relatively large number of interceptors would be required. Moreover, counter-ISR efforts that could be interpreted as being aimed at strategic early warning are likely only to be employed in extremis, given the mutually catastrophic consequences of targeting early warning systems or being perceived as doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, Russia would face two choices – a large and probably expensive expansion of its air and missile defence architecture, or the adoption of a posture that required it to engage in both counter-ISR and nuclear posturing relatively early in a crisis. Both approaches involve considerable dilemmas for Russian leaders, either at the level of resource allocation or in terms of escalation control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several deductions can be made based on the analysis in this paper. First, a net assessment of the balance of capabilities able to affect the army deep and beyond suggests that in many ways Russia may be more disadvantaged than NATO. The changing geographical boundaries of the Alliance mean that the traditional Russian distinction between operational-tactical and operational-strategic missiles no longer holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, exacerbating this challenge for Russia does not require NATO’s European members to develop exquisite or especially long-ranged capabilities. In many ways, short-ranged (up to 500 km) air-to-surface and surface-to-surface fires can have similar effects, particularly with respect to BMD. This depends, however, on the availability of US capabilities in areas such as hypersonic weapons, since the costs of conventional prompt strike and the lead times associated with developing it make any effort to achieve this on a national basis or at the European level an uncertain enterprise. Off-the-shelf purchases of existing medium-range strike capabilities are probably more cost effective. Where domestic industrial aims are a concern, they might be better served by generating the capacity to produce key bottleneck components (for example, rocket propellant), which can both ensure domestic content and create greater symmetry in transatlantic partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the capacity of non-US NATO members to generate targets is both limited and relatively vulnerable to disruption. While the growing scale and diversity of the space-based ecosystem for ISR provision makes counterspace operations difficult, soft-kill options remain a relatively cheap offset in which Russia could invest further. Of equal importance is ensuring the availability of geospatial intelligence and human capital sufficient to enable intermediate target development and advanced target development, for which the Alliance is currently heavily reliant on the US. There is also a question of how systems that can have both tactical and operational roles (for example, the precision-strike missile) fit within Allied C2 structures, and the degree to which their use should be part of an air campaign’s planning, in the way maritime strike assets such as Tomahawk often are. Building the organisational capital to sustain a strike campaign may, then, be of greater significance to NATO than the ability of member states to generate small numbers of relatively exquisite capabilities, such as hypersonic weapons. As things stand, Russia will have to undertake considerable burdens to defend against far more simple threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to air and missile defence, the Russian threat as currently constituted is most problematic at the FLOT and up to army deep. Beyond this point, NATO’s considerable advantages in numbers and quality of aircraft can allow it to offset what is primarily a cruise missile threat with a lower rate of interceptor expenditure than might be presumed if only surface-based responses to threats are considered, although this depends on the availability of systems such as the E-7 Wedgetail AWACS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also noteworthy that the demand for hit-to-kill interceptors, per the modelling for this paper, is considerable (and in excess of the demand for air-to-air interceptors in the early days of a conflict). This would become more acute if a Russian IRBM threat developed in Europe (this paper considers a Russian hypersonic glide threat unlikely, since Russia has not yet demonstrated the operational capability of the Avangard, and the Kinzhal is not hypersonic per se). However, as things stand, the relative paucity of hit-to-kill interceptors represents a more acute capability challenge. This is a concern, since much of the serial production of surface-based interceptors being undertaken in Europe is focused on systems such as PAC-2 GEM, rather than on hit-to-kill interceptors, as BMD is an area where the efficiencies provided by Allied advantages in the air are less significant. Equally, the survivability of ground-based TELs will be reduced as a conflict wears on, and if SEAD efforts succeed. Moreover, Russian targeting early in a conflict is likely to be narrowly focused on disrupting air threats, reducing the aperture for defenders. Russian targeting can be made more inefficient if surface-to-surface threats have to be tracked and engaged as part of the effort to deflect an aerospace assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, deep-strike capabilities represent an area where the Alliance can both shape the contours of Russia’s force generation, and reinforce specific lessons that Russia believes it has learned from previous conflicts, in ways that result in inefficient resource allocation that will necessarily slow the reconstitution of Russia’s forces.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英反問控方：撫心自問現在香港有沒有人可以說真話？官打斷：不容政治言論&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4AjHGKV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（24日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第137日審訊，黎智英第45日作供。控方繼續盤問，圍繞黎在國安法生效前後發表的專欄文章，指稱黎意圖藉文章引起恐懼、製造《國安法》負面印象等。其中〈窒息中的香港人 逃亡還是抗爭〉一文稱：「國安法不僅把香港變成沒有自由法治的一般大陸城市，甚至會是新疆一樣恐怖籠罩下的集中營，怎不令香港人害怕」，控方質疑說法毫無根據。黎反問：「如果你撫心自問，現在香港有沒有任何人可以說真話？」法官杜麗冰打斷，指黎並非正在回答控方問題，並嚴正表示：「我不會容許任何政治言論」，她其後稱：「作出這樣的言論是沒有用處，因為這並不是在回答問題，我不會給予任何比重。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱從報紙得知有年輕人寫遺書&quot;&gt;黎稱從報紙得知有年輕人寫遺書&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續就黎發布於專欄「成敗樂一笑」的文章盤問。2020年6月14日的專欄文章〈窒息中的香港人逃亡還是抗爭〉，開首稱：「中共對付香港抗爭問題，從來不去了解幾百萬人行出來遊行抗爭，尤其是年輕人寫下遺書連命都不要」，控方問黎從何得知有年輕人寫遺書？黎稱從報紙得知，按他理解該些年輕人是勇武派，想成為「殉道者」，又指報紙乃經事實查核才會發表相關報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NuyIwtg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 副刑事檢控專員 周天行&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎早前在作供時已承認他被自己的報紙所誤導。黎表示不記得，惟強調報紙有時候無可避免會犯錯，但是一般而言他們會在發表報導之前查核事實。控方問黎不會自行作出事實查核，而是依賴自己報紙的報導？黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章稱：「國安法是習帝忍無可忍，龍顏大怒重錘一擊，還配合威迫、恐嚇和清算建立全面恐怖式鎮壓。」控方問「威迫」和「恐嚇」是什麼？黎在庭上稱，這是他當時的猜測，後來全部實現，又指現時香港每日都有「恐嚇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎反問控方有沒有人在香港可以說真話-遭官打斷不會容許任何政治言論&quot;&gt;黎反問控方有沒有人在香港可以說真話 遭官打斷：不會容許任何政治言論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，文章稱：「國安法不僅把香港變成沒有自由法治的一般大陸城市，甚至會是新疆一樣恐怖籠罩下的集中營，怎不令香港人害怕」，是毫無根據的說法。黎則回應：「如果你撫心自問，現在香港有沒有任何人可以說真話？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官杜麗冰打斷，指黎並非正在回答控方問題，並嚴正表示：「我不會容許任何政治言論」，重申控方的問題是，黎撰寫文章的時候有沒有任何基礎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著問黎，其文章的指控是否沒有基礎？黎表示可以這樣說。控方追問，是否基於黎的個人感受？黎則表示，是來自當時所聽到的消息，而這些情況後來已經實現了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官再度打斷，指黎再次答非所問，並表示：「作出這樣的言論是沒有用處，因為這並不是在回答問題，我不會給予任何比重。」黎表示：「OK。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎意圖藉上述毫無根據的言論，引起讀者恐懼，及挑起反政府情緒。黎不同意，堅稱只是他的猜測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎早前供稱不認同美國取消香港特殊地位-卻未有在專欄文章表明&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎早前供稱不認同美國取消香港特殊地位 卻未有在專欄文章表明&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述文章稱：「美國政府要取消香港特殊地位，考慮予香港人居美簽證的方便，英國迫不得已履行前宗主國的責任，鋪排賦予三百萬BNO持有人居英權。」控方問黎當時是否與美國想法一致，即是想美國取消香港特殊地位。黎不同意，強調只是在文章中陳述事實。控方質疑，黎早前供稱不同意美國取消特殊地位，卻未有在文章中表明相關立場，問他是否想向讀者分享他的想法。黎則稱，當時有關取消香港特殊地位的新聞鋪天蓋地，否認想透過文章向讀者分享其想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，從文章可見黎似乎緊貼不同國家因應《國安法》所作出的反應，問黎有否留意到 IPAC（對華政策跨國議會聯盟）？黎否認，稱沒有留意IPAC。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引述文章稱：「中共罔顧香港人和世人眼光的雪亮，仍無恥地大鑼鼓聲拋出謊言，面對這樣無恥無信的政權你何從適應，除了一走了之，香港人還有甚麼選擇？」，指黎不是想向香港人散播他的感覺嗎？黎則稱，很多香港人已將資產撤離香港，可是香港政府卻聲稱大企業支持《國安法》，這是錯誤的。法官李運騰指，上述段落並非關於商界。黎堅稱他撰寫文章時是從心而發，只是想向讀者陳述他的感覺，而非嘗試說服讀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱其刑事恐嚇案只是小案件但被禁出境-形容很神奇&quot;&gt;黎稱其刑事恐嚇案只是小案件但被禁出境 形容「很神奇！」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，黎在文章中提及自己被控刑事恐嚇，控方向法庭申請禁止黎出境，他稱：「誰會在國安風頭火勢之下承受政治風險？我們律政司司長鄭若驊不是斬釘截鐵地說，國安法不設追溯期，是大話連篇嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上解釋，這宗所謂的「刑事案件」只是一宗小案件，可是法庭不批准他出境，「我認為這是很神奇！」控方質疑這是黎的揣測，並試圖向讀者散播反對《國安法》的情緒。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於指稱律政司司長鄭若驊說《國安法》不設追溯期是「大話連篇」，黎在盤問下承認沒有任何基礎。控方指黎意圖藉文章煽惑對政府不滿、激使人循不合法途徑改變依法制訂的制度，以及引起不同階層居民之間的惡感。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;文章引述別人稱勾結外國勢力可以被槍斃-控方黎毫不在乎真相&quot;&gt;文章引述別人稱勾結外國勢力可以被「槍斃」 控方：黎「毫不在乎真相」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示2020年7月5日的專欄文章〈飛翔吧 良知的脊樑在撐著〉，控方引述其中一句：「國安惡法條文比我們最壞的預期還要壞」，問黎撰文的時候已閱讀過《國安法》條文？黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指文章提及：「有心人說，快點走，勾結外國勢力是叛國罪，可以是槍斃的啊！」，質疑黎明知《國安法》沒有叛國罪及死刑，上述言論明顯不實。黎同意根據《國安法》，上述說法不實，但強調只是引述「有心人」告訴他的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時周天行引用黎早前反駁他的說話，揶揄道：「你似乎毫不在乎真相」，質疑黎有意散播假資訊，以引起恐懼。黎否認，並重申上述言論只是別人告訴他。控方表示：「黎先生，你可否不要再說謊？」黎則回應：「我不會停止說謊，我沒有在說謊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎意圖藉文章引起讀者對特區和中央政府憎恨、引起不同階層居民之間的惡感、激使他人以非法手段改變依法制訂的制度。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，黎撰文的時候，既然明知道「有心人」所說觸犯《國安法》是叛國罪及可以槍斃，說法並不真實，為什麼未有在文章中補充，例如「當然在《國安法》下，這不是真實的」？黎認同若果當時這樣寫會更好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎確認發布專欄文章前從不會作事實查核&quot;&gt;黎確認發布專欄文章前從不會作事實查核&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月12日的專欄文章〈從荒蕪到繁榮 再墮封建懸崖〉，當中稱：「鄭若驊說，警方有合理懷疑就可以拉人，即是說警察不用證據，只要全憑想像便可以拉人封艇，法律越模糊空泛越令你無所適從，就是要你終日戰戰兢兢。」控方指，黎早前作供時已承認他對於「合理懷疑」有誤解，因此上述字句是出於無知，沒有經過事實查核、也沒有徵詢律師。黎確認，並表示：「我當時不小心。」、「我當時是無知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，黎在發布專欄文章之前，從不會對自己的陳述作事實查核嗎？黎確認不會，因他不認為任何作者會在撰寫文章的時候作獨立的事實查核，因他們只是引述新聞報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述文章稱：「港澳辦副主任鄧中華說，國安法立法非一次性，就是說還未夠辣，繼續會制訂相關加辣法律，難保以後不會有電子監控和關住百萬人的集中營。新疆已在咫尺之間！香港人唔驚得咁多喇，以後就走肉行屍做人吧！」，控方質疑上述只是黎的個人情緒，沒有任何事實基礎。黎稱這是他基於邏輯的猜測。控方反指是黎的想像。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;文章稱國安法下香港國際金融貿易中心的地位必然告終-控方質疑捏造&quot;&gt;文章稱國安法下「香港國際金融貿易中心的地位必然告終」 控方質疑捏造&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章又指：「香港人除了恐慌，要顧慮的還有生計。不是願意做順民以後生活照常工作照舊，國安法實施後香港營商環境變了，我們生活質素和工作機會也會改變。國安法摧殘了香港的法治，做生意的人以後再無法律保障，只能賄賂有權監管他的官員來保護他，香港將如大陸一樣貪污氾濫。沒有了法律保障，金融市場頓然失去了互信，沒有了互信，彈指間億萬美元交易的運作便無法進行，香港國際金融貿易中心的地位必然告終，資金外流，商業投資更不用說是沒有了。香港經濟萎縮，就業機會減少，失業人數增加，我們習慣昌盛繁榮的香港將成歷史遺蹟，我們將活在蒼白無望的世界，甘願做順民也找不到工作。是，我們好撚鍾意香港，但生計不繼，不想移民也得移民。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑上述只是黎毫無基礎的猜測。黎否認，強調上述情況後來實現了。控方重申只是問及黎撰寫文章的時候。黎則回應：「如果我說的東西後來實現，這代表我當時有一定的基礎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「國安法摧殘了香港的法治」，控方問黎，國安法怎樣摧殘香港的法治？黎指《國安法》凌駕了本地法律，《國安法》有條文指當《國安法》與本地法律有牴觸時，《國安法》優先。黎並強調自己有基礎，但是亦有可能出錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑黎是否觸發讀者的恐懼？黎否認，並稱只是說香港國際金融貿易中心的地位告終。控方說：「黎先生，我們仍然有國際金融中心地位」，籲黎集中回答問題。黎則反駁：「我不認為我們仍有國際金融中心地位。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官杜麗冰打斷，指現在似乎變成了爭辯，籲黎回答控方問題，即是黎是否同意文章所述沒有基礎。黎堅稱：「我有我的基礎。」杜官指：「不！你不是在回答問題。」黎反問：「我可以解釋我的答案嗎？」杜官回答：「不可以！」，警告黎不要作出政治言論，「你不容許作出任何解釋，請回答問題！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎在文章中捏造事實，引起讀者對特區和中央政府不滿。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;文章稱國際對中國的制裁會比當年六四更有過之而無不及-黎屬推測&quot;&gt;文章稱「國際對中國的制裁會比當年六四更有過之而無不及」 黎：屬推測&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月19日專欄文章〈時間就是武器〉，文章指：「國安法掀起國際政府的反彈前所未有，最後國際對中國的制裁會比當年六四更有過之而無不及，而正好是中國經濟、社會和外交上，遇到經濟開放四十年以來最大危機。」控方問黎是否想外國對中國實施比當年六四更嚴厲的制裁？黎指這是他的猜測，他沒有說過想這個情況發生，又指「國安法掀起國際政府的反彈前所未有」是事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章最後一段指：「我不相信做生意的人，沒有了法治保障還會戀棧這地方，香港的國際金融中心地位還可以保得住。我也不相信美國等西方國家對中共的制裁會放緩，中共與美國等西方國家的關係大勢已去，暫時是無法逆轉的。我更不相信中共對香港最後不會拉人封艇，進一步打壓，但這會是一兩年後的事了。希望到時習近平大勢已去，中共回歸開放的正軌，我們便有喘氣的機會。」控方質疑黎是否在說國安法下香港沒有法治？黎稱這是他的推測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於「我更不相信中共對香港最後不會拉人封艇，進一步打壓」一句，控方問黎早前的證供不是表明希望《國安法》條文可以放緩嗎？黎稱這是他的一廂情願，因不想中共摧毀香港。控方又問，黎想習近平下台嗎？黎僅稱：「他會被勸退（He would be eased out.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提議，黎的文章意圖引起讀者對特區和中央政府不滿和憎恨，以及意圖激使市民以非法手段改變現有合法政制。黎不同意。控方又指，文章意圖煽惑他人使用暴力，以及煽惑他人不守法律。黎表示完全不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安法條文指凌駕本地法律-黎承認混淆基本法及本地法&quot;&gt;國安法條文指凌駕本地法律 黎承認混淆《基本法》及本地法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著向黎出示2020年7月9日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目謄本。黎在節目中稱，《國安法》必然是代表香港的「喪鐘」，因它凌駕（supersedes）了《基本法》，使香港沒有自由和法治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎有何基礎這樣說。黎指《國安法》有條文規定若然《國安法》與《基本法》有牴觸時，《國安法》便會優先。控方反駁指，這條文只提及本地法律，並沒有提及《基本法》。法官李運騰亦表示，黎對條文的理解有誤，因《基本法》並不是本地法律。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在沒有任何事實基礎之下作出有關言論。黎回應：「我當時以為這是事實，我搞錯了。」控方問黎是否故意地作出不實言論。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎嘗試製造國安法負面印象&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎嘗試製造《國安法》負面印象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述黎在節目中指，若然沒有法治的話，在香港做生意的人便會很危險，商人唯一得到保護的方法便是依靠有權力的官員，意味香港將會好像中國內地般出現貪污問題，「因為有權力保護你的官員不會免費地替你這樣做，他們需要保護費，而保護費是貪污。」控方質疑黎閱讀《國安法》條文時，有沒有注意到有條文指《國安法》依然會保障和捍衛人權？黎表示：「這是它說的，但我不相信。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，不論黎相信與否，他從未有在節目言論中提及該條文，並質疑黎嘗試製造《國安法》的負面印象，故意地嘗試誤導觀眾。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，黎在節目中稱《國安法》影響市民生計，是嘗試引起恐懼，令人害怕《國安法》會限制市民自由，惟當中沒有事實基礎。黎則強調他所述的情況已經實現了。控方指節目播出日期為2020年7月9日，當時《國安法》生效了只有數日，黎是基於什麼事實而說《國安法》影響生計？黎指這是出自受過教育的節目嘉賓，而他們所說的已經實現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎承認中共可以撕毀基本法說法沒有事實根據-惟否認製造負面印象&quot;&gt;黎承認「中共可以撕毀《基本法》」說法沒有事實根據 惟否認製造負面印象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎並在節目中稱，國際社會需要關注香港情況，因中共可以撕毀《基本法》，以顯示對法律的絕對不尊重，他認為國際與中國做生意的之前應三思。在控方盤問下，黎承認「中共可以撕毀《基本法》」說法沒有事實根據，也沒有經事實查核，但是否認製造負面印象，因外國與香港貿易往來時，的確有三思。控方追問黎從哪裡得知？黎指當時到處都有相關的新聞報導，例如《華爾街日報》和《紐約時報》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎意圖藉著節目言論引起觀眾對政府憎恨、蔑視和不滿，以及激使他人以非法手段改變現有合法制度、慫使他人不守法。黎一概否認，反問控方：「你從哪裡可以看到？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭表示，法庭在早休之前已經向黎解釋，控方只是指出其案情，黎只需要回答同意或不同意，至於控方案情是否有基礎，則需留待法庭決定，問黎是否明白。黎未有回答。控方接著問黎是否明白法官所言。黎沉默不語。控方再次問黎是否明白。黎繼續沉默。李素蘭隨後問：「所以你不回答嗎？」黎才說：「是。」李素蘭問黎是否明白。黎最後表示：「是。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後指出，黎意圖藉節目言論煽惑他人使用暴力。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;下午黎在法庭內、在法官不在席之下，檢視非由他撰寫的涉案文章，以紀錄是否曾經閱讀過該些文章。案件押後至明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

This report analyzes Kenya’s investments, stabilization efforts, and business ties in the DRC, assessing opportunities and challenges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kenya’s political stability outlook and its role in shaping regional peace and stability have made it an influential member of the East African Community (EAC).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years, Kenya has sought to consolidate partnerships in the bloc as a means of economic expansion, particularly in the finance and transport sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peace and security initiatives have accompanied this effort, as instability inhibits economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kenya’s economic expansion has generated geopolitical tensions that threaten long-term cooperation and broader stability in the EAC, particularly as Kenya takes the helm of the bloc instead of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which had been tipped for the position.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report analyzes Kenya’s political and economic influence in the EAC through the nation’s initiatives in the DRC as Kenyan President William Ruto takes up the rotational leadership of the bloc for the next year.i The EAC now comprises eight member states: Burundi, the DRC, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. The report explores the impact Kenya has had on expanding the regional bloc over the last five years (2019–2023), Kenya’s influential role in stabilizing the region, and how Kenya’s intervention in the DRC has consolidated business interests that were established in 1967 when the two countries first forged diplomatic relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report also focuses on challenges and opportunities around Kenya’s economic initiatives in the DRC. It deals with Kenya’s financial initiatives, analyzing how they spur private investment in the country and their impact on trade at large with other members of the EAC. The aim is to understand how Kenya is rising as a regional power within the EAC by extending its influence across other member states, especially the DRC. This study is mainly qualitative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report, which draws from a review of academic literature, official documents, and commentary on the EAC, is based on field research conducted in Nairobi, Busia, and Mandera, Kenya, and in Kinshasa and Goma, DRC, in the fall of 2024. At the request of the interviewees, their comments have been kept anonymous. In conducting this study, the researchers met with a broad cross section of informants: government officials, trade association leaders, business operators, youth leaders, diplomats, current and former politicians, independent journalists, local political analysts and academics, and military officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Kenya’s presence in the DRC may be traced to the 1960s, when the two countries achieved independence, relations between them reached new levels following DRC President Félix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo’s rise to power in January 2019. When the DRC joined the EAC in April 2022, a new dynamic emerged, increasing Kenyan investments in key strategic areas, such as the financial system, aviation, and the oil and energy sectors, and earning Kenya a significant, influential position in the Congolese economy. While these investments benefit the DRC to some degree, they also have a negative impact on a country that has limited industrial output. The DRC has a consumer market where local investors and companies do not compete as they would in a more liberal economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report provides explanations for this recent dynamic in Kenya’s economic initiatives, specifies the implications for the DRC and the region, and sheds light on the initiatives’ prospects by interrogating—using a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) approach—the chance for Kenya to maintain its current position or to increase its influence, even if a change of government occurs in the DRC. The conclusion offers recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-kenyas-political-and-economic-influence-in-the-eac&quot;&gt;Background: Kenya’s Political and Economic Influence in the EAC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya is widely considered an economic and logistical pillar of the EAC due to its political stability outlook, well-established infrastructure, and regional peace initiatives. Since the inception of the bloc in 1967 and its revival in 1977, Nairobi has sought to be a dominant regional power despite the EAC’s rotational leadership and egalitarian ideals. President Ruto is embarking on his tenure as the leader of the EAC by “enhancing regional competitiveness, promoting value-added production, boosting intra-regional trade, and attracting greater investment to the region’s economies.” President Tshisekedi notably skipped the EAC summit on December 1, 2024, which also marked 25 years of integration; insiders noted that he had been tipped to take up the post but had been beset by the security crisis in the eastern DRC and may not have been in a position to lead the bloc. The two have had an uneasy relationship, partly due to Ruto’s perceived forceful style, compared with the pragmatic and conciliatory approach of his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta, who was initially spearheading the DRC’s peace process. Indeed, prior to winning elections, Ruto was the subject of derision for remarking that the DRC had “no cows” and would need Kenya to import milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, tensions persisted between the two countries after Kenya spearheaded a failed peacekeeping mission, seeking to play a larger role in economic initiatives in the DRC off the back of its historic political and economic expansion in the country and its ambition as an aspiring hegemon of the EAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International relations lecturer Dr. Gilbert Kimutai describes regional hegemons as “countries that are able to shape the fortunes of other countries through their greater economic power, military might, and political influence. They are countries that have dominant influence or authority over others.” A journalist covering regional developments observed that Kenya has demonstrated these qualities by being the gateway to the region, particularly considering its strategic positioning near the Indian Ocean and its use of infrastructure to sustain interconnectedness and consolidate shared political and diplomatic values. These have partly driven the growth of Kenyan business interests in the region and, notably, as this paper assesses, in the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key DRC sectors in which Kenya has grown its footprint include banking and finance, insurance, transport, hospitality, and import and export. Some of Kenya’s earliest investments in the DRC predate the latter’s official inclusion in the regional bloc. Since the 1970s, Kenya’s port of Mombasa has enabled Congolese traders from the eastern provinces to import and export goods. Kenyan financial institutions were also instrumental in providing loans and capital to Congolese businesspeople, establishing cross-regional trade and partnerships. The DRC Kenya Chamber of Commerce noted that this first-to-market advantage enabled Kenyan businesses to quickly set up shop in the DRC, particularly between 2015 and now, tapping into a population of nearly 100 million people. Therefore, the expansion of Kenya’s private sector players into the DRC—and the stability and acumen these have brought in—have provided a strong foundation for government-led expansion and cooperation between the two countries, especially as the DRC seeks increased political and security support from the EAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2021, during a state visit by former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta in Kinshasa, the two countries signed four pacts on general cooperation that cover the joint promotion of scientific, technical, and sociocultural programs. A year later, exports from Kenya to the DRC were worth $141 million, while exports from the DRC to Kenya were worth $30.4 million. A trade mission sponsored by Equity Bank on behalf of the two governments in April 2022 saw more than two dozen Kenyan companies pledge to invest $1.6 billion into the DRC. A Kenyan journalist who has been tracing the expansion of the EAC over the past five years observed that the relationship has remained asymmetric due to Kenya’s political and economic advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-of-the-relative-adoption-of-the-eac-charter&quot;&gt;Impact of the Relative Adoption of the EAC Charter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya has consistently advocated for the EAC to be better integrated, ostensibly to extend its economic reach in the region. An international relations lecturer at the United States International University-Africa attributed this to Kenya’s capitalist approach, which has been enhanced by foreign direct investment (FDI) and the fact that the country has often “taken on the burden of streamlining protocols.” An integral element of integration, however, is the relationship between member states. According to the African Development Bank (AfDB), “the major challenges of regional integration in East Africa” are the “lack of complementarity in trading, low competitive position of countries to supply goods in the region . . . institutional capacity weakness to advance regional integration, and failure to address political issues related to regional integration.” For instance, in August 2013, Kenya entered into a separate pact with Uganda and Rwanda—the coalition of the willing—that undercut trade with Tanzania as competition heightened. This undermined the Common Market Protocol, which sought to abolish restrictions on trade and movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expectation within Kenya’s business community had been that the DRC’s entry into the EAC would further harmonize trade, especially after Tshisekedi pledged in 2021 to undertake reforms that would streamline the tax and regulatory environment for ease of business. However, the uneven adoption of the EAC’s administrative mechanisms continues to hamper not only trade relations between Kenya and the DRC, but also broader intraregional trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 outlines the various steps EAC members must take to fully ratify the charter and highlights the member states that have fully adopted various tenets to compare levels of compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fiNufEg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Steps to Harmonization of the EAC.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eac.int/the-secretariat&quot;&gt;“The Secretariat,” EAC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tensions between Kenya and the DRC, partly driven by differences between the respective leaders of the two countries, as highlighted earlier, will likely slow the ratification of the EAC charter, as well as planned reforms outlined by Tshisekedi, potentially undermining years of preexisting cooperation in the private sector. For the moment, Kenyan businesses are not experiencing operational difficulties, demonstrating the capacity to disentangle political tensions from the broader economic benefits. Nevertheless, an audit and advisory firm that recently established operations in Kinshasa observed that the DRC will continue to need support to enable regional businesses to navigate the country’s legal, regulatory, and tax environment. It also identified two other areas that would be affected by the geopolitical tensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business uncertainty:&lt;/strong&gt; Kenya-based businesses may slow partnerships and trade due to limited diplomatic cover (the DRC has yet to approve Kenya’s ambassadorial appointment more than seven months down the line), which can hurt local economies and the potential for investment and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of market access:&lt;/strong&gt; Barriers such as trade restrictions or new tariffs risk being applied with limited diplomatic recognition, which leads businesses to risk losing revenue and diminishes market opportunities for Kenyan businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, investor confidence has not declined, as the risk appetite of most Kenyan businesses appears high, according to one consultant with a risk advisory. Despite the internal security issues facing the mineral and agricultural sectors that Kenyan companies have sought to expand in, businesses are likely willing to withstand periods of political tension, as many established operations prior to the current challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;courting-the-drc-peace-and-stability-for-business-expansion&quot;&gt;Courting the DRC: Peace and Stability for Business Expansion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, it is imperative to discuss Kenya’s involvement in the DRC by briefly reflecting on the failed security intervention. Although Kenya and the DRC already have well-established bilateral relations, the prevailing sentiment when Presidents Kenyatta and Tshisekedi signed bilateral deals in 2021 was that further integration through the EAC could be achieved only alongside mechanisms for peace and stability, particularly in the eastern regions, which are the gateway to the central African nation. A journalist with the East African, a regional weekly paper, stated, “DRC’s entry to the bloc could not be separated from tackling insecurity because the entryway from neighbors to the country is through the volatile east.” He added that Kenya’s previous role in peace and security initiatives in the region, including in South Sudan (another EAC member state) and Somalia (the latest entrant), partly underpinned Tshisekedi’s confidence at the time in Kenyatta’s ability to stabilize the east. At the same time, a Mombasa-based historian observed, “While such security issues may have informed Kenya’s entry into such a volatile theatre of conflict, a close reading of Kenya’s intentions in DRC may reveal other economic considerations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya’s military intervention against the resurgence of the March 23 Movement (M23) became the first true test of the Eastern African Standby Force, established in 2004 but operationalized only in 2011 to intervene in growing regional conflicts. The forces’ capacity was reinforced by the adoption in 2012 of the EAC Conflict Management Act, which “seeks to prevent internal, cross border, and regional conflicts affecting partner states; bring together conflicting parties for mediation; encourage the parties to a conflict to resolve conflict amicably; encourage cooperation among partner states in conflict management; and coordinate post-conflict management.” The DRC is so far the first and only site of military intervention by the force, dubbed the East African Community Regional Force (EACRF). This was alongside the Nairobi process, in which members of armed groups active in the eastern DRC took part in peace talks with the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EACRF did not engage in direct combat as had been widely anticipated, and Ruto expressed disappointment at the lack of additional funding to support the regional troops. As this failed to materialize, the rationale for a more aggressive posture for the EACRF dwindled. Geopolitical relations further aggravated mistrust, with a prevailing perception that Kenya sided with Uganda and Rwanda, which have long been considered sponsors of M23 despite repeated denials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An EACRF insider noted that despite relative success in upholding ceasefires and delivering humanitarian aid in North Kivu, a lack of understanding about the mandate of the force precipitated its failure. A series of papers examining the nine-month intervention also observed, “Each contributing country’s different understanding of the mission fueled suspicion, confusion, and misinformation,” which in the long run threatens to undermine Kenya-DRC relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kenya-as-a-traditional-congolese-economic-partner&quot;&gt;Kenya as a Traditional Congolese Economic Partner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya and the DRC established diplomatic relations in 1967. Their economic ties have always been fluid and facilitated by the geographical position of the DRC in the heart of Africa, linking East Africa to the Atlantic Ocean. Several eastern DRC provinces (notably, North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri, and Tshopo, among others) are economically dependent on the Central Corridor, which includes Mombasa, Kenya, as the import and export port for the Congolese on the Indian Ocean. The Directorate General of Customs and Excise (DGDA), a public Congolese agency that collects taxes levied on exports and imports, has representation at the port of Mombasa, where goods transit from or to the DRC, as in the case of the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam. Kenya is also a destination for many Congolese migrants. According to a Kenyan official, more Congolese reside in Kenya than Kenyans in the DRC for several reasons, including personal security and employment, business, and educational opportunities. The current Kenyan population in the eastern DRC is likely about 2,500, including around 50 investors, whereas Nairobi alone is home to at least 10,000 Congolese. This migration often goes together with business and the creation of enterprises. Congolese investments, financial placements, and loans to Kenyan companies make the DRC, among other EAC partner states, the highest holder of Kenyan foreign liabilities, estimated at $1.4 billion in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Kenya and the DRC established diplomatic relations in 1967. Their economic ties have always been fluid and facilitated by the geographical position of the DRC in the heart of Africa, linking East Africa to the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya’s economic involvement in the DRC gained momentum at the beginning of the 1970s. Nairobi became a hub for Congolese traders from Beni and Butembo in North Kivu Province. Gold, timber, and coffee from the DRC were already transiting there to the port of Mombasa. Conversely, Congolese traders were receiving goods from Nairobi long before discovering the trade route to China. An informant reported that Congolese were receiving support in terms of loans and other facilities in Kenya to sustain this business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya’s investments in the DRC are notable chiefly in the service sector, such as transport, oil, hospitality, and telecommunications. For instance, Jambojet, an airline founded in 2014, launched its direct flight from Goma to Nairobi in September of 2021. It is the second Kenyan airline, after Kenya Airways, to operate continuously in the DRC. Congo Petrol is the largest Kenyan company in the oil sector operating in Kinshasa, Goma, Lubumbashi, and Kolwezi. Incorporated in 1997, it has become a distributor and licensee of the Dalbit brand which was established in Kenya in 2002. Another example is the Serena Hotel, which belongs to Vanny Bishweka, a Congolese businessman based in Goma, but is managed by Kenyans. Other small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been established in Kinshasa, such as Fontana Hotel in 2003 and African Digital Networks in 2011. Sojax Paint Company, created in partnership with the Congolese in 2017, has branches in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates that, for a long time, the Kenyan government has had a clear policy of trading with the DRC, aiming to make it a consumer market for goods and services produced in Kenya or distributed by Kenyans. However, the Kenyan government has made limited investments in the DRC’s production sector, and Kenya has never been the DRC’s top economic partner. According to figures from the Congo Central Bank (BCC), 43.5 percent of Congolese imports come from African countries—mainly from South Africa, Zambia, and Tanzania. The DRC is ranked sixth among Kenyan export markets. In terms of Congolese exports, however, China is the top DRC trade partner, while South Africa comes first among African countries. A Kenyan official indicated that his country seeks to do more business with the DRC, improve its economic position, and catch up with other African states. This competitive mindset alone may be the driver of the new dynamic in Kenya’s rising investments and growing influence in the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 24, 2019, Tshisekedi came to power following the tenure of former President Joseph Kabila. The peaceful transfer of power was a milestone because it had not happened in the DRC since its independence. For the first time, people hoped for a return to stability and a good business climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya seems to have understood this and has taken initiative to increase its investments, mainly in the banking sector. This choice has three justifications. First, Kenya has been present in the Congolese banking market since Equity Group Holdings acquired Pro-Credit Bank in 2015; the subsidiary was renamed Equity Bank Congo. Second, the market is still largely available, as only around 7 percent of the population have bank accounts, similar to Kenyans in the early 1990s, according to James Mwangi, Equity Group’s managing director. Third, banks are the catalyzers of entrepreneurship thanks to the support services they provide to investors, such as safe placements, financial transactions, and loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second DRC bank that Equity Group Holdings acquired is the Congolese Commercial Bank (BCDC), incorporated in the DRC in 1909, whose main shareholder was the family of Belgian tycoon George Forrest. Equity Group Holdings bought up to a 65 percent stake in this entity in December 2020, and BCDC merged with Equity Bank Congo to form one entity named Equity BCDC, which officially opened on April 21, 2021. With a balance sheet in excess of $3 billion, Equity BCDC became the second-largest bank in the DRC, behind Rawbank, which was created by the Rawji family, of Indian origin, in 2002. One year later, another Kenyan company, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), purchased an 85 percent stake in Trust Merchant Bank (TMB) in December 2022, whose assets were worth $2.2 billion in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investments like these are not unique to the DRC because Kenya has also bought subsidiaries in other EAC member states. A case in point is Rwanda, where “KCB acquired a 62.06 percent stake in Banque Populaire du Rwanda (BPR) from the British financial services conglomerate Atlas Mara Ltd in 2021 and later increased the stake to 76.67 percent by acquiring additional shares from the minority shareholders.” However, what is changing with respect to the DRC is Kenya’s growing interest in the Congolese market, the scale of its investments, and the trend to consolidate the partnership from a long-term perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of benefits, the DRC has surpassed Rwanda as the most profitable market for Kenya among other EAC member states. According to the Central Bank of Kenya, subsidiaries of Kenyan banks in the DRC have recorded 45.5 percent of the total pretax profit of Kenyan banks within the EAC market, or $229 million in 2023. Equity BCDC has realized a net profit of $102 million. There is a scramble for the DRC market because it is lucrative and underexploited. More Kenyans are investing in the oil sector—for instance, by establishing fuel stations for local consumption. Other companies are extending the range of their market, as in the case of Congo Petrol, which now serves the west of the country and established a new branch in Kinshasa in April of 2024. Kenyans are also investing in the energy sector through GL Energy Africa, established in Kinshasa in July of 2024, which aims to create energy solutions, such as building electricity plants, for public or private corporations that may be in need. The entity is part of Janus Continental Group, a larger company based in Nairobi. Overall, Kenyans are looking for more markets given the “booming private sector and a vast expansion of SMEs,” implying a high productivity of the local Kenyan industry. With a population of over 100 million, the DRC alone offers a significant market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, on the political front, the DRC effectively joined the EAC in 2022, creating hopes for a new business environment. The scale of its partnership with Kenya expanded through the conclusion of a general cooperation framework in April 2021. The bilateral agreement covers various matters of common interest in the economic, political, and security areas. This development reflects a tight rapprochement between the two countries. Kenyatta, the former president of Kenya, played an important role because he is considered the godfather of the Cap pour le changement (CACH) political coalition, created in Nairobi, which had supported Tshisekedi’s candidacy during the Congolese presidential election of December 2018. Kenyatta’s close friendship with Tshisekedi facilitated the latter’s interest in joining the EAC. Among the Congolese, however, the decision to join the EAC was contentious, as they did not vote for the consequential commitment. The population of eastern provinces tended to support the decision, while those living in other parts of the DRC never embraced the idea. Nevertheless, strategic trade missions and meetings were organized to attract investors on the territory of both countries. It is necessary to explore the consequences of this economic dynamic for the DRC and the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-the-drc-and-the-region&quot;&gt;Implications for the DRC and the Region&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenyan investments in the DRC come with benefits and costs. Benefits represent the gains, and costs represent the losses or negative impacts for the DRC and the EAC region. The implications of these investments are tied to the context: The DRC appears to be economically weaker than Kenya, which is the largest economy in the EAC, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $116.6 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In contrast, the DRC’s GDP was $83.1 billion in August 2024. Furthermore, the Congolese economy is less diversified and is supported mainly by exports from the mining sector. As a reminder, Tanzania is the top Congolese trade partner within the EAC in terms of both imports and exports. This signals that while Kenyans are investing in the DRC and making more tangible profits than in any other EAC member state, Congolese do not reciprocate with a similar dynamic in Kenya. This is due to shortcomings in production activities. Apart from producing raw materials—timber in particular—the DRC is mainly a consumer market. As an informant from the BCC stated, “We do not have an economy, and we have not even figured out how to put one in place.” After the admission of the DRC into the EAC, the few Congolese assets in Kenya fell by 30 percent, from $1.4 billion in 2021 to $969 million in 2022. The economic relationship between the two countries is therefore unbalanced, and the deficit will widen as long as the DRC remains unproductive and weakened. Kenya is not to blame; rather, the Congolese government’s economic policies and governance are perceived as not living up to the power potential of the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The DRC appears to be economically weaker than Kenya, which is the largest economy in the EAC, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $116.6 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In contrast, the DRC’s GDP was $83.1 billion in August 2024.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The negative impacts are higher for the Congolese side. In fact, there is a wide perception among Congolese that Kenya’s investments in the DRC may end in an economic hegemony with devastating adverse effects on local investors who cannot effectively compete with Kenyan investments. Kenya dominates the oil sector in the eastern DRC, for example, in terms of the supply chain and fuel distribution. The same is true for the food product, beverage, and equipment sectors. A civil society activist reported a case in the cement sector in which Nyiragongo Cement, a new Congolese company created in 2014 and headquartered in Goma, nearly went bankrupt because of insecurity, among other factors, due to the ongoing armed conflicts around the production site. The company has failed to compete against products imported from Simba Cement, a Kenya-based corporation. Yet, he added, the cement business had received financial support from the Industry Promotion Fund (FPI) and a tax exemption from the DRC government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another civil society informant said Kenya’s influence is such that the DRC cannot withstand economic shocks without Kenyan investment in certain areas, such as the banking sector. This is a matter of national security for the DRC since all banks are now under majority foreign control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Kenyan investments also generate benefits for the DRC. One of these is the opportunity to restore security in the eastern DRC, which has been affected by protracted armed conflicts for around three decades, including ongoing aggression by Rwanda and Uganda that is currently supported by rebels of the M23. The DRC has bargaining leverage to engage in strategic diplomacy, pushing the Kenyan government to exercise its influence on other EAC member states involved in these conflicts in order to pacify the region. Through this, the DRC could gain peace, Kenya the security of its investments, and the region new economic opportunities. The strategy could also encourage the DRC to further its integration into the EAC without hesitation, because in joining the community, it expects “a real impact on the course of stabilization processes” in its eastern provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an economic level, the benefits for the DRC are rather standard: employment for Congolese and payment of various taxes. For instance, Equity BCDC had 1,713 staff in 2023. Kenyan banks have facilitated the digitization of services and opening of accounts for millions of Congolese, including public servants who are paid by them following an arrangement with the DRC government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most significant benefit is probably the support banks give to households, individual entrepreneurs, and companies. TMB, in particular, resorts to leasing operations to finance start-ups as well as small and medium companies. Leasing is a method of financing investments that allows a company or an entrepreneur to use the equipment of their choice or a property in return for a monthly charge and to decide at the end of the contract whether to purchase the equipment or property. Another unique mechanism TMB has carried out in the Congolese banking landscape is the offer of life insurance, which partly compensates for the deficits of the Congolese social security system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equity BCDC has been more successful. For example, it acquired the Emmanuel 4 boat company through the financing of the Silimu establishments. The vessel now facilitates maritime transport on Lake Kivu from Goma to Bukavu. Equity BCDC has extended its approach to the grassroots by providing small loans to individuals in the informal small trade to help them survive. It also provides, in compliance with the social responsibility of corporations, socio-financial services such as loans, training, and supervision to young entrepreneurs, particularly in agriculture. Thus, Equity BCDC trained 1,665 farmers in financial education and agricultural entrepreneurship in 2023, and a loan volume of $589,840 was disbursed to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-and-limitations&quot;&gt;Challenges and Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These benefits, however, are marred by a multitude of factors that inhibit inclusive banking services and regional trade. First, the demand for financing and loans is very high, especially in the extractive industries, trade, and household sectors, and banks cannot serve everyone. As a banker in Kinshasa explained, banks are commercial entities, and any bank exercises caution before carrying out a given financial operation by assessing the cost, profit, and risk. He added that the risks of non-reimbursement are equally very high because of the absence of solid loan guarantees. In 2023, for instance, Equity BCDC canceled around $13 million in outstanding loans to SMEs that were unable to repay on schedule. For the informant, it is up to the DRC government to find alternative solutions for investors, either by providing banks with risk-sharing guarantees or by financing investors directly through its own mechanisms, such as the FPI and the Entrepreneurship Guarantee Fund in the Congo (FOGEC). Banks can strive only to complement these governmental efforts. Equity BCDC is already on this path. It has concluded several partnerships with international development agencies, such as the African Guarantee Fund, the International Finance Corporation, the French Development Agency, and the U.S. Agency for International Development, to improve its financing capacity toward SMEs and receive risk-sharing guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, some investors, entrepreneurs, and traders are reluctant to use available banking services because of expensive charges. In the example of Equity BCDC, an informant in the Goma branch of the Congo Business Federation (FEC) noted that an international transfer of $100,000 could entail, in addition to undue delays, a commission of up to $3,000, which could prompt potential customers to place their money in banks incorporated in Rwanda so as to pay their foreign suppliers at a lower cost. A similar practice, he added, could be observed among small traders who would rather request loans from microfinance institutions and thus avoid unbearable charges for opening bank accounts or withdrawing cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, banks cannot cover the whole country; therefore, many Congolese do not have access to banking services. In 2022, TMB, for example, reported over 2 million customers, 105 branches, and 3,000 points of sale across 33 cities and 21 of the country’s 26 provinces. Equity BCDC is even absent in the provinces of Maniema (east), former Bandundu (south west), and Equateur (north west). This is due to the size of the country, which encompasses 2.345 million square kilometers and is devoid of essential communication infrastructure that could facilitate access to remote areas. From an economic perspective, banks normally operate in areas that are secure and free from violent armed conflicts, where the market is available and lucrative and therefore does not require excessive further investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these factors and obstacles raise legitimate questions about the prospects of Kenya’s economic initiatives in the DRC. It is particularly necessary to highlight the chance for Kenya to maintain the level of its investments or increase its influence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prospects-for-kenyas-economic-influence-in-the-drc&quot;&gt;Prospects for Kenya’s Economic Influence in the DRC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a net potential for Kenya to gain more influence in the Congolese economy, even if, to date, it is behind the top six DRC trade partners: China, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Zambia, and Tanzania. Kenya has the advantage of being familiar with the Congolese market in a handful of strategic areas, such as the financial system, and making a profit. There is also the will to expand this experience, as evidenced by newcomers in the Congolese economic landscape. In the banking sector, in particular, Kenya has encountered almost no competition from other EAC member states. Profit may have a multiplying effect because it increases Kenya’s assets and constitutes an incentive for diversifying investments. All this can encourage more Kenyans to do business in the DRC. Kenya will still benefit from a liberal economy and Congolese liberalization policies, which have extended economic opportunities to various areas: mining, energy, agriculture, telecommunications, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are at least two major weaknesses. On one hand, the relative limitation of Kenyan investments to a few strategic areas, as specified above, prevents Kenya from benefiting from other lucrative sectors, including public infrastructure such as roads, hospitals, water supply systems, and housing. Yet these are among the DRC’s priorities according to the 2023–2026 Public Investment Program (PIP). As Kenya is already making significant profit from its economic initiatives in the DRC, its brand image could be tarnished if the Congolese government claims Kenyans care only about their interests and neglect the DRC’s development priorities. As an informant from civil society noted, the trend is almost the same for all EAC partners—that is, the DRC is exploited, either legally, illegally, or through violence, without giving it the slightest chance to recover. Some Western political figures, such as Herman Cohen, have proposed allowing East African countries such as Rwanda to exploit Congolese resources, with the DRC gaining tax payments under the framework of trade and regional economic integration, as well as gaining peace. The public has criticized this role of providing resources and money to other countries, considering it a major obstacle to the DRC’s development. If Kenya wants to make its economic presence more meaningful to the Congolese, it should expand its initiatives to the aforementioned DRC development priorities, and banks could provide financial support. Kenya would thus be on the path of countries such as Uganda, which in 2021 concluded an agreement with the DRC to build the Kasindi-Beni-Butembo and Bunagana-Rutshuru-Goma road sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it is worth noting the Congolese administration’s and justice system’s harassment of foreign investors in general and Kenyans in particular. In the example of Equity BCDC, Mr. Jean-Pierre Bemba and others orchestrated a judicial procedure to seize and sell the bank’s headquarters in Kinshasa, claiming a debt of $9 million against Western Union Company, which uses the services of the bank for money transfers. A lawyer based in Kinshasa explained that the claim was related to allegedly false testimonies and cooperation provided by Western Union to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in a case in which Bemba and others were prosecuted for corruptly influencing witnesses. Despite the judgment of the Constitutional Court in November 2022 stopping the seizure—in particular for violating the right to property guaranteed by the Congolese constitution—Bemba and others persisted in trying to sell the bank’s headquarters without having any legally valid title. Even if TMB does not face as much harassment as Equity BCDC, it has reported cases of the tax administration arbitrarily closing its branches in the cities of Mbandaka and Kananga without notice. In fact, tax harassment in terms of the number of levies and the multiple and sometimes irregular collection services is a common concern for Kenyan investors. This raises the question of respect for the rule of law and the fight against corruption as prerequisites for a good business environment in the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are opportunities to improve the situation. First, the DRC government has announced that the 2002 Investment Code will be further modified. This is an opportunity to alleviate taxes on Kenyan companies by expanding the reach of the legislation to currently excluded sectors and other domains that may be of interest to Kenyans: mining and oil, banks, insurance, and other commercial activities. In this regard, support from the National Agency for the Promotion of Investments (ANAPI) in terms of tax exemption and technical assistance for the application of this legislation is likely to push more investors into those sectors and reduce ongoing administrative harassment. Second, if the general cooperation framework agreement concluded between the two countries in 2021 is carried out in good faith, then it may result in a complementary bilateral investment treaty that will provide specific protective measures of a legal, fiscal, judicial, and political nature for investors in the territories of each party beyond the guarantees they hold in accordance with other international and regional instruments. The EAC treaties are among the latter instruments, beginning with the community’s constitutive act, which aims to promote economic integration through “a Customs Union, a Common Market, subsequently a Monetary Union and ultimately a Political Federation.” But the DRC has neither ratified nor implemented these arrangements in its domestic legal order, therefore rendering them inapplicable to citizens of EAC member states. As an informant within the Congolese Ministry of Foreign Trade stated, “DRC is a member of several regional organizations of integration but largely remains outside trade arrangements.” The Congolese government has nevertheless pledged to apply EAC treaties, as it admits that though they do not yet benefit the country, they will make Kenya freer to invest in the DRC thanks to uniform regional rules on the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital and the right of establishment and residence within the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these prospects are realistic and achievable, but they may be compromised if two major threats are not eliminated, the first of which is the insecurity problem due to continued armed conflict in the eastern DRC. No long-term investments can flourish where peace and stability remain elusive. As discussed, Kenya has an interest in contributing to the resolution of these conflicts, which is why it led the EACRF to stop M23 rebels in North Kivu province. However, the mission failed because of various factors, including planning deficits, lack of coordination between troop-contributing states, divergent views and interests, and, chiefly, the DRC government’s ineffectiveness and complacency toward Rwanda and the rebels. The EACRF, whose deployment began in November 2022, was obliged to withdraw as the Congolese government refused to renew its mandate beyond December 8, 2023. It was replaced by the Southern African Development Community’s Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (SAMIDRC). As the lead nation of the EACRF, Kenya suffered a major blow, tarnishing its image among the Congolese people as a DRC ally. This could negatively affect the current economic relationship between the two countries should political and popular perceptions treat Kenya as a hostile country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, another threat is the DRC’s attempt to retreat from the EAC—a subject which has been at the center of public debate since the failure of the EACRF. There is a broad perception that the EAC is useless, and the DRC cannot remain a member while other member states attack it with impunity. In addition, the DRC considers EAC trade arrangements unfavorable, making the country more dependent on foreigners because it largely lacks production capability. Although the population has exerted pressure on the Congolese government, a withdrawal would mean the rejection of economic integration and a return to a variety of drastic trade barriers, including the imposition of visas. This is not in the interest of the population of the eastern DRC, which depends closely on East Africa. This may be the reason why the Congolese government is very cautious about moving in the direction of withdrawal and it is not yet on the official agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;All of these prospects are realistic and achievable, but they may be compromised if two major threats are not eliminated, the first of which is the insecurity problem due to continued armed conflict in the eastern DRC. No long-term investments can flourish where peace and stability remain elusive.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusions-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya has significantly invested in the DRC, even though it is not yet among the top Congolese trade partners (China, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Zambia, and Tanzania). Its economic initiatives are driven by the fact that Kenya is looking for more markets abroad due to the dynamic, high level of productivity of its local companies and industries. The DRC market is equally large and lucrative, and it is underexploited. Another factor behind Kenya’s continued investments in the DRC is the diplomatic rapprochement between the two countries, as evidenced, mainly, by the conclusion of a general bilateral cooperation framework in 2021 and the admission of the DRC into the EAC in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya is present in some strategic areas of the Congolese economy, such as the banking, oil, transport, and energy sectors. This gives Kenya economic influence in the DRC. Notably, Kenya has acquired the major banks Equity BCDC and TMB, which are an integral part of Kenyan regional corporations—that is, Equity Group and KCB, respectively. These acquisitions have improved its position as an emerging power within the EAC. Congolese and other investors are already benefiting from their financial services even though these services lack an inclusive character because access is still limited for some, while others avoid banking because of excessive or unbearable charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chance for Kenya to maintain its position in the DRC or to increase its economic influence will depend on its ability to consolidate its achievements and significantly expand the range of its investments in other lucrative areas that constitute development priorities of the Congolese government—notably, agriculture, mining, and public infrastructure such as roads, hospitals, water supply systems, and housing. It will also depend on the accessibility of the Congolese market in accordance with the principles and objectives of a liberal economy, on how the DRC positions itself toward regional integration within the EAC, the gains it makes in the security arena, and positive perceptions of Kenya as an ally rather than a hostile country undermining the interests of Congolese people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above, it is appropriate to make the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DRC should remain a member of the EAC; ratify, implement, and apply the community’s treaties; and align its domestic legislation to regional legal standards, specifically those related to the EAC’s customs union and common market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DRC should improve its business climate by reforming its tax system, the investment code, and justice system as a prerequisite for the rule of law and economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kenya should establish holistic investment opportunities that not only underpin its ambitions for further economic expansion but also contribute positively to the DRC’s stability outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kenya should develop a stronger bilateral defense and security partnership with the DRC to help the latter rebuild its security sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both countries should work together and use the EAC mechanisms to resolve the armed conflicts in the eastern DRC and restore peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DRC and Kenya should support banks in partnering with development agencies so as to increase their capacity to finance young entrepreneurs and SMEs, as well as to develop reliable risk-sharing guarantees capable of leading to inclusive banking services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Banks should be interconnected with subsidiaries established in each EAC member state in order to facilitate regional trade, such that any placement or transfer of money is possible in any state on the same account and is considered local to further the free movement of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kenya and the DRC should conclude a bilateral investment treaty complementary to other international and regional arrangements that are binding on trade and business in general.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relations between Kenya and the DRC may still be sustained through robust business partnerships that predate the central African nation’s entry into the EAC. The business community remains an integral part of aligning the economic goals of both countries and building resilient joint activities of mutual benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can continue to complement the Nairobi process, which, with additional political goodwill from members of the regional bloc, is likely to support stabilization efforts in the east. Finally, deployments of the EACRF should be made not only in cases that align with Kenya’s economic interests; this broadening would facilitate more effective responses in the event of subsequent interventions by the EACFR as, for instance, conflict-affected Somalia joins the EAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these findings, the following recommendations are put forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EAC should continue to prioritize peace and security initiatives to stabilize the DRC, which will consolidate investments and promote trade and economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EAC Secretariat should expedite the implementation of the road map in order to streamline relations and the adoption of outstanding administrative issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The regional force should be depoliticized and provided with a clearer mandate that addresses the real needs and aspirations of the populations to prevent the pitfalls of mistrust that undermine peace and stability initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the foreseeable future, however, as a community, the EAC will remain fragmented due to the competing ambitions of political leaders and countries. Conflicts in the region pit EAC members against each other, with the interests of local elites taking precedence over economic integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行出示2019年5月5月黎的專欄文章〈諗移民定諗遊行〉，文章稱：「跟這個邪惡的林鄭政府拼一拼，還是早走早着」、「朋友搶着說，實在忍受不了林鄭和高官那些不屑的蔑視嘴臉，沒有比這種嘴臉更侮辱」、「明明是利用台灣兇殺案作幌子，來掩飾惡法暗渡陳倉的陰毒，卻仍視全香港巿民是傻瓜的囂張態度，就知道這地方已到了令人無法忍受，無藥可救的地步。」黎稱僅引述朋友的言論。控方追問黎是否同意？黎稱同意，並確認他與朋友的感受一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑黎希望讀者與他有共同感受，意圖引起對政府的憎恨。黎則稱他只是撰寫文章述說香港情況，以及講述香港人的感受。控方質疑：「黎先生，你不能代香港人說話。」黎同意他不能代香港人說話，但是他只想反映香港人的感受。他否認有意引起對政府的憎恨及居民之間的不滿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑文章稱：「將來修訂了『逃犯條例』還可以隨時拉你鎖你，多神奇的權力」，是毫無根據的說法，只是基於黎的個人感受，目的是引起讀者恐懼。黎堅稱有合理理由作為根據。控方又指，文章有意激起香港居民間的不滿；黎否認，重申只是講述自己的感受。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎嘗試向讀者散播其主觀感受-黎否認發自內心撰文&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎嘗試向讀者散播其主觀感受 黎否認：發自內心撰文&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指文章稱：「冰封三尺非一日之寒，特首高官對我們蔑視的態度，是在京官對香港人的厭惡和摒棄心態的薰陶下，不由自主的條件反射」，是黎的個人偏見、主觀判斷和感受，又質疑黎嘗試將這種感受向廣大讀者散播。黎則否認，強調自己無論撰寫任何文章，均是發自內心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章提到：「我們都心中有數，特首高官那種不屑我們的輕蔑態度，正反映出中央對香港人的態度；大把大陸人等着來香港，你們香港人這麼麻煩，早走早着好了。在他們心中我們早已被放棄，想你走之心形諸於色，對你棄如敝屣便蔑視你。蔑視往往是令人絕望的心理因素。」控方質疑這是黎的主觀判斷、個人感受，而他想想向讀者散播這種感受。黎否認，重申文章所述是發自其內心，他亦否認有意使讀者有相同感受。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎誇大議題的迫切性鼓吹讀者行動&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎誇大議題的迫切性、鼓吹讀者行動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章指：「為甚麼我們要出來遊行？因為行動才有效果，反對的文字和反對的聲音抽象得只會一瞬即過。」、「從以上實例證明，若然我們只是在聲音或文字上提出反對，林鄭和高官只會堅持自己對『逃犯條例』的成見。不過，若我們人多勢眾站出來遊行，無論他們多機心叵測，亦要面對我們堅決反對惡法的事實，他們可能會畏縮而妥協。我們不能放棄讓他們看到為了保衛家園，我們會去到盡，堅決抗爭到底的事實。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎鼓吹讀者行動？黎稱只是鼓吹市民出來示威，而示威也屬於一種行動。控方提及黎早前供稱「行動勝於空談」；黎回應他只是想市民出來示威，以保護自己的家園。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎在文中稱：「難道不值得你們為他們作最後努力」，是誇大議題的迫切性。黎否認誇大迫切性，強調只是呼籲人們出來遊行保護家園。控方指黎嘗試激起市民對政府的敵意及引起憎恨；黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎在文章中未有提及任何建設性的對話。黎稱：「因為沒有任何具建設性的對話，我怎樣提及？」杜官追問黎同意還是不同意？黎稱不同意。控方最後指文章意圖引起對政府憎恨、藐視和不滿；黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎批評控方案情與事實無關屬想像-官提醒只需回答同意與否&quot;&gt;黎批評控方案情與事實無關、屬「想像」 官提醒只需回答同意與否&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年4月26日黎的專欄文章〈專橫暴政打壓 我們氣魄不滅〉，當中稱：「中共出擊撕掉《基本法》，摧殘香港一國兩制特別行政區地位。沒有釋法權利的港澳辦和中聯辦高調曲線釋法，稱兩辦並非《基本法》22條所指的一般意義上的『中央人民政府所屬各部門』，公然向港府奪權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑「撕掉《基本法》」和「高調曲線釋法」等，並沒有官方說法支持或任何事實基礎，只是黎的意見。控方指文章意圖引起市民憎恨特區和中央政府，以及激使香港居民循非法手段改變現有合法制度。黎批評這是控方的「想像」，並且不能同意他的「想像」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方籲黎只需要回答同意或不同意，以免浪費法庭時間。黎反指：「可是如果你能夠說事實，也可以令事情更加簡單。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時，法官杜麗冰打斷，重申控方必須向黎指出其案情，這是控方的職責，若黎不同意便回答不同意，毋須與控方爭辯。黎則反問，如果控方的案情與事實沒有關係，為什麼要花時間逐一提問？杜官重申控方必須逐一指出其案情，可能黎有點欠缺耐性。此時黎插口說他並非欠缺耐性，只是控方的案情與事實無關；杜官隨即提高聲量，嚴正地表示：「如果他（控方）的提問與事實沒有關係的話，我會制止他」，並重申控方有權履行他的職責，而黎只需直接回答同意與否。黎聽罷問，他是否有權向控方提問作出質疑？杜官則指黎無權質疑，籲黎毋須與控方爭辯，以節省法庭時間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認其文章煽動暴力-反指和理非是最具力量&quot;&gt;黎否認其文章煽動暴力 反指「和理非」是最具力量&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎的文章稱：「今日我們明知有事，中共打到嚟必然大清算大清洗，清算不聽話的人，清洗英國殖民地遺留下來保護港人自由的法治和機制，把香港人變成任由習帝擺佈的奴才，因此我們會繼續起來抗爭到底，希望趁習帝內外危機四伏，和慘遭武漢肺炎瘟疫人命摧殘和經濟淪陷後，各國尤其美國向中國責難及局部制裁，迫使中共不敢太明目張膽，暫時克制對香港的迫害⋯⋯」控方問黎是否提倡制裁？黎確認，並表示當時一廂情願地認為美國會向中國責難及局部制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章又稱：「中共最怕也最難克服的是香港龐大的人民力量，這些溫和但大多數的市民，是我們整個逆權運動最強大的力量，若被嚇怕不敢再出來示威遊行，剩下屬於小撮的勇武派便容易處理了。和理非的大部份香港人抗爭意志被嚇窒了，小撮的勇武派便失去了市民眾志成城的維護和支持，衝擊暴力的士氣和勇氣被削弱，中共便輕易制服這幫人，我們整個運動儘管不是完結，也畫上休止符了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在盤問下，黎確認他希望運動繼續下去，但強調「和理非」示威者才是最有力量。控方問黎是否不想勇武派被制服？黎則澄清，其文章是說不想「和理非」被制服，使勇武派也被制服。控方指黎意圖鼓吹市民使用暴力。黎反問：「我說非暴力是最有力量，你怎樣可以詮釋為暴力？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，文章意圖引起市民憎恨政府、引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛，以及引起或加深香港不同階層居民間的惡感及敵意。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指slack部份群組相隔多月不見飯盒會會議重點&quot;&gt;控方指Slack部份群組相隔多月不見「飯盒會」會議重點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方續就通訊軟件 Slack 群組紀錄提問，並向黎智英出示其帳戶版面，顯示當中8個群組，包括「港蘋online對話」、「港蘋報紙對話」、「港蘋online news對話」、「香港蘋果紙主管」、「港蘋online中層」「港蘋video talk」、「港蘋深化內容」和「港蘋紙廣告」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上曾供稱，每星期輪流與其中一個部門舉行「飯盒會」，由於一共有8個部門，因此每個部門相隔兩個月才有一次「飯盒會」。然而控方指從黎的 Slack 紀錄中，各部門並非相隔兩個月便有一次「飯盒會」紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方先展示「香港蘋果紙主管」群組對話。黎稱群組被創立是為了「特別目的」，因當時《蘋果》正籌備推動訂閱，而訂閱牽涉各個部門的主管，因此需要將不同部門主管加入群組。法官李運騰問及，訂閱是網上訂閱還是報紙訂閱？黎指是網上訂閱。法官杜麗冰問，那麼為什麼需要所有部門的主管加入群組？黎指因為所有部門都牽涉新聞內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，時任執行總編輯林文宗的訊息與網上訂閱無關。黎則重申，改善內容質素與訂閱有關，以吸引讀者訂閱。黎並確認沒有獨立記憶，若然缺乏紀錄的話，便記不起「飯盒會」討論過什麼內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示「港蘋online中層」群組，創立於2019年3月6日，在同年3月12日之後便再沒有新訊息。黎稱該群組是用來與中層職員討論商業計劃，並非一個獨立的部門，所以沒有恆常召開「飯盒會」，但是曾經舉行會議討論訂閱計劃，惟黎稱已不記得會議內容。法官李素蘭指從群組中看不到任何會議重點的紀錄。黎則稱不知道為何群組有一段長時間沒有任何訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，部份訊息下方顯示曾經「修改（edited）」，而黎就著訊息的回覆也未能看到。黎一概表示不知道原因，又指負責截圖的人可能他們未有替他的回覆截圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎供稱，只有可執行的提議才會被紀錄在會議重點之中，當討論有成果的時候，便有可執行的提議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，從「港蘋online對話」紀錄可見，在2019年10月至2020年1月，這大約10個月之間，並沒有任何「飯盒會」的會議紀錄，問黎知不知道原因。黎稱不知道。控方又舉例指，從「香港蘋果紙主管」群組對話可見，從2019年2至9月期間沒有任何「飯盒會」會議紀錄，中間相隔了7個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問黎，是否有可能在相關時段曾經舉行「飯盒會」但是未有紀錄會議重點？黎不認為有這個可能性，因為會議必定能得出可執行的提議，「不能想像在整個會議期間，沒有任何可執行的提議。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押後至下周一（24日）早上續審，然而當日下午，黎將在法庭內、在法官不在席之下檢視涉案文章，以紀錄是否曾經閱讀過該些文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第135日審訊，黎智英第43日作供。控方就黎的專欄文章〈2020年和勇一起撐下去〉提問，質疑黎指控警員喬裝黑衣人破壞店舖，是意圖引起讀者對警察的憎恨；又質疑黎未有在文章中譴責暴力。黎否認引起憎恨；雖然他未有直接譴責暴力，但也未有鼓吹暴力，又稱他在文章中質疑「裝修」的黑衣人是否「我們的勇武手足」，是「間接譴責」暴力。另外，文章稱：「這場逆權運動正促使中共加強對學生換頭洗腦」，控方質疑黎毫無根據地作出揣測。黎否認揣測，並指透過教育來迫人愛國是錯誤的，因這是將國家置於人民之上，猶如「將僕人置於主人之上」，是顛倒真理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎沒有人認為叫喊光時是錯-惟因為政府後來變成是錯的&quot;&gt;黎：沒有人認為叫喊「光時」是錯 惟因為政府後來變成是錯的&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎出示2020年1月5日黎專欄文章〈2020年和勇一起撐下去〉。在盤問下，黎解釋他對「勇武派」的理解，他認為「勇武派」是出現在示威前線的人士，但是不一定所有「勇武派」都會做出暴力行為，例如當中有的人只是參與暴動，但是沒有做出暴力行為，當警察來到時，他們便立即跑到後方，那些便是「非暴力的勇武派」。而黎視自己為「非暴力」及「和平」。法官李素蘭問到，勇武派是年輕人嗎？黎同意，指他們是「渴求變革的年輕人（Young Turk）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章提到，黎看到一個十四、五歲戴口罩的少女，大喊：「黑警死全家！」和「香港差佬，X你老母」，他當時對何俊仁說：「有這樣的後生，我哋冇得輸。」黎並在文中稱：「有這樣疾惡如仇的優秀勇敢年輕人，香港真是塊福地。」黎在庭上表示，當時被運動的氛圍影響和誤導，「我認為這個回應是低俗的（bad taste），而我感到後悔。」黎又稱，他不同意「黑警死全家」和「香港差佬，X你老母」這兩句口號，認為這是低俗（cheap）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yowaO7Q.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎支持另一句口號「光復香港 時代革命」嗎？黎重申未有思考過，因這是一個普遍的口號，當時很多人叫喊。法官杜麗冰質疑，黎是參與遊行的其中一員，在現場聽到有人叫喊這個口號，怎麼會未曾思考過支持與否呢？黎則稱因為這口號在當時是很普遍，反問：「為什麼我要思考（支持與否）呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則指黎其實是有思考過，因他的文章提及過「光復香港，時代革命」，所以必定在他的腦海之中。黎則回應：「你可以充當心理學家，但是我不同意。」黎又指，他未有想過這句口號是對或是錯，「因為政府，它後來變成是錯的，但是當時而言沒有人認為它是錯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎是否支持「光時」，黎否認。控方又問在國安法之後，黎是否繼續支持「光時」？黎亦否認，並指認為它是違法的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;文章懷疑警方喬裝黑衣人-控方意圖引起對警察憎恨&quot;&gt;文章懷疑警方喬裝黑衣人 控方：意圖引起對警察憎恨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，黎在文章中指：「我不知道『裝修』匯豐銀行的黑衣人是否我們的勇武手足，但是打爆中國人壽店舖玻璃的兩位黑衣人便甚有可疑。」控方問黎為何稱呼該些人為「勇武手足」？黎稱因為他們也在同一場運動中，這是自己稱呼他們的方式。控方問：「因為你是勇武隊的一份子？」黎回應：「你知道我不是勇武隊的一份子。」法官李運騰問，根據文章標題「和勇一起撐下去」，黎是否想團結不同群體的人？黎同意。控方追問，黎是否將自己與勇武派聯繫起來？黎否認，重申這是他稱呼同樣參與運動的人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述文章指，有人質疑兩名打爆中國人壽店舖玻璃的黑衣人是喬裝警員，「若然這推斷屬實，警方的目的便是要製造暴亂，藉此行使警暴恐嚇和理非遊行人士，使他們以後再不敢出來遊行，曲線鎮壓我們的遊行人數，削弱我們的抗爭聲勢，令抗爭運動逐漸凋零。」黎在庭上稱，他只是提出問題，從沒說過他肯定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，從文章中似乎看不到任何譴責暴力？黎則稱他對於暴力抱負面態度，所以才會問「裝修」匯豐銀行的黑衣人是否「勇武手足」。李官質疑，因為黎希望避免批評「裝修」匯豐銀行的黑衣人？黎稱他只是引述其他人所說的話，那些黑衣人可能是喬裝警員。李官問，所以黎是基於其他人的言論，而不是自己耳聞目睹？黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂指，黎在文章中作出猜測和揣測，嘗試指控警察喬裝示威者以製造暴亂。黎否認作出猜測和揣測，稱只是引述新聞報導所述情況，並且只是提出疑問。控方又指，黎有意圖引起讀者對警察憎恨。黎亦否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎強調文章只是反映市民情感警民關係差&quot;&gt;黎強調文章只是反映市民情感、警民關係差&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎在文章中使用「裝修」一詞來形容破壞店舖的行為，是採用了勇武派的語言，黎這樣做是為了證明自己是勇武派的一份子。法官杜麗冰亦指，文章予人印象黎是支持「勇武手足」，對於匯豐銀行被破壞使用「裝修」一詞，因為黎懷疑這是否喬裝警員所為，然而對於中國人壽店舖玻璃被破壞，黎則使用不同的言詞，問黎是否同意？黎僅稱，他認為破壞匯豐是負面、不好的事情，所以提問這是否「勇武手足」所做的。杜官反駁指，黎僅形容「裝修」匯豐銀行，對有關行為不具批判性。黎則堅稱他在文章中以負面的方式提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官提到文章指「當然這是以奸人之心度警察之腹的陰謀論，但事到如今，我們若仍未認定警方是謊言和陰謀氾濫的奸人精，就真有點天真無邪了吧。」李官問這是否黎當時的結論？黎回答：「在當時，是的。」控方問，黎認為警是「謊言和陰謀氾濫」嗎？黎確認。控方指，黎透過這文章意圖引起對警方的憎恨。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎的文章續指：「事到如今，警察殘害市民的暴戾，已使他們成為市民面對的最大的敵人。最初我們的口號是『香港人加油』，然後是『香港人反抗』，現在惡化到有些人叫喊『香港人報仇』，當然仇恨不可取，卻令我們知道警民關係惡化到甚麼程度。」黎稱以上是當時香港人主要情感，他認為仇恨當然是不好，但是顯示到當時警民關係有多麼差，強調上文只是反映市民的情感。控方問，這些是市民的情感，而市民又是否包括黎？黎否認有這樣的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎的文章提到爭取特赦被捕示威者能夠「團結前線的手足」。黎表示認同。控方質疑黎的文章未有譴責暴力。黎則堅稱，他沒有譴責暴力，同時也沒有鼓吹暴力，並且對於破壞店舖的行為抱持負面看法；他對於破壞者的身份有懷疑，某程度上也是對暴力的「間接譴責」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎所謂的愛國教育其實是洗腦&quot;&gt;黎：所謂的「愛國教育」其實是「洗腦」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述文章指：「教育是我們今後抗爭重要的戰場。中共將這場抗爭運動的責任推到教育制度上，把教育界變成政府施政失當的代罪羔羊。⋯⋯是的，這場逆權運動正促使中共加強對學生換頭洗腦，教育局長楊潤雄已對教育界文革式施壓亮劍，明言學校認為涉事（反送中）教師『沒有問題』，學校、校長的態度立場就可能『有問題』，如果覺得校長不能勝任，可以取消其校長資格。中共加強對學生換頭洗腦已然啟動，我們不能讓中共發動文化大革命式的破壞，摧毀我們原有的教育價值觀和文化。對每一位教師和校長因言入罪，我們和勇派必須挺身而出，嚴正反抗。」控方質疑這是黎的揣測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則反駁指這不是揣測，因時任教育局局長楊潤雄說過，那些認為教師參與「反送中」是沒有問題的學校和校長，才是有問題的。黎又表示，他認為所謂的「愛國教育」其實是「洗腦過程」，因為當愛國是出於自願的時候才是高尚，但若然是透過教育來強加於人，便是錯誤的，因為這是將國家置於人民之上，猶如「將僕人置於主人之上」，是顛倒真理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，楊潤雄的言論並未提及中共，質疑黎作出揣測。黎同意是揣測。控方續指黎意圖引起市民對政府的憎恨。黎表示：「我沒有引起仇恨，我不同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官提到，文章稱：「中共的換頭洗腦教育灌輸的是階級鬥爭的仇恨和邪惡。」李官問黎是否指稱中共透過洗腦教育來灌輸階級鬥爭的仇恨和邪惡？黎同意，並稱這是根據他在中國內地的親身經驗，他認為這是在中國可能發生的事情。法官杜麗冰指，但是這已是很多年前的往事，問黎怎能以那麼多年前的事作為根據？李官問黎是否指六十年代？黎確認。控方問黎是否想向讀者散播這種情感？黎稱只是想讀者警覺有可能發生什麼事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎有意藉文章引起市民對香港及中央政府的憎恨、藐視及不滿。黎表示：「完全不同意。」控方又指，文章有意激使市民以非法手段改變現有政制、引起居民間的不滿、煽動市民使用暴力以及不守法。黎一概不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，在2019至2020年間，黎從沒有譴責示威者的暴力行為，是因為想運動繼續下去，又指黎希望運動能維持某程度上的暴力，以免失去國際支持。黎一概否認，重申他反對暴力的原因是不想破壞運動的道德高地，影響國際社會的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑李怡文章提倡dq主任應被制裁&quot;&gt;控方質疑李怡文章提倡「DQ主任」應被制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示《蘋果》全版廣告「誰殺死 他 她 他 和 她 ……」、2019年10月7日報導〈壹週刊：女示威者警署內遭折磨叉頸掂胸侮辱阻瞓覺〉和2020年10月25日社評〈蘋論：警暴消失的「太平日子」將來臨（古立）〉。黎均稱不認為或不記得曾看過，控方遂未有繼續提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著問黎有否閱讀已故作家李怡所撰寫的社評。黎稱很少，又指李不是那種會談論國際議題的作家。控方指，黎一直以來爭取懲罰侵犯人權的官員，有關國際的文章不會引起黎的興趣嗎？黎稱這不代表他要閱讀所有文章，否則他會很忙碌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示李怡的專欄文章〈夜行人吹口哨〉，刊登於2020年8月10日。文章提及8月7日美國宣布制裁11名中港官員，當晚「不僅11人及其家人睡不著，恐怕一些追隨者，一些做了昧著良心事情的人也睡不著」，並舉例指「DQ主任，作惡黑警，港大校委會18名成員」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎在美國宣布制裁翌日（即8月8日）發布Twitter帖文：「那些取消候選人資格的選舉主任又如何呢？他們應該在個人方面為這些決定負責任嗎？（How about those election officers (選舉主任) who disqualified #DQ the candidate nominations? Should they be personally responsible for making the decisions?）」，而李怡在文中亦有提及「DQ主任」，是否與黎的帖文想法一致，即是提倡「DQ主任」理應被制裁？黎則稱他的帖文是指「選舉主任」，而不是「DQ主任」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指slack群組有的訊息被刪除&quot;&gt;控方指Slack群組有的訊息被刪除&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方較早前呈上通訊軟件Slack的《蘋果》員工群組紀錄，惟控方爭議相關紀錄的真實性和完整性。控方向黎展示多項群組對話，當中顯示有的訊息被刪除。惟黎稱未有為意，也不知道誰人刪除。他稱控方的問題屬技術性問題，而他無法解答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認曾向張劍虹提及邀請美國退休軍官jack-keane擔任直播節目嘉賓&quot;&gt;黎否認曾向張劍虹提及邀請美國退休軍官Jack Keane擔任直播節目嘉賓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行就網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」提問。時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹曾供稱，黎向他提及邀請到美國退休軍官 Jack Keane 擔任節目嘉賓，張當時表達憂慮，惟黎回應：「佢哋（中共）咁搞我，我一定去到盡㗎，我冇得褪㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今在庭上重申，他從沒有向張談及 Jack Keane 及其他朋友，他有可能在其他場合說過上述說話，但是並非關於 Jack Keane。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎堅稱除張志偉外-其他蘋果高層沒參與製作live-chat節目&quot;&gt;黎堅稱除張志偉外 其他《蘋果》高層沒參與製作Live Chat節目&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，黎早前供稱「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」是他的個人節目，與《蘋果日報》無關，然而控方展示一連串訊息反駁說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中2020年5月30日的訊息，時任動新聞總監張志偉在群組中交代 Live Chat 的製作安排，提及黎將會在節目中與外國讀者互動，顯示節目並非只是關於黎一個人。黎則堅稱節目是其個人節目。此外，張劍虹在群組中表達對於國安法的憂慮；黎則稱這是張自己的憂慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，從訊息可見，《蘋果》管理層似乎參與在節目製作，例如張志偉制訂執行計劃並向群組交代。黎同意張參與其中，但是其他管理層並沒有參與。法官李素蘭又質疑，若然節目是黎的個人節目，為何張志偉會說他們會將直播片段發布在黎的 Twitter 帳戶上，而不是由黎的「徒弟」李兆富做這件事。黎則稱李兆富僅負責 Twitter 帖文，然而這是直播節目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指，因為他使用《蘋果》及其職員，所以才會在群組中交代節目安排，讓其他管理層知道。他重申，只有張志偉及另外2名職員參與節目，張劍虹則只是表達關注，而其他管理層則只是被通知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息指目的是和外國讀者互動控方可見節目與蘋果有關&quot;&gt;訊息指「目的是和外國讀者互動」控方：可見節目與《蘋果》有關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2020年7月2日的訊息，張志偉在群組中提及 Twitter Live 將於7月9日早上開始做，「目的是和外國讀者互動，打國際線，宣傳英文版蘋果」，控方指這顯示直播乃與《蘋果》有關？黎則稱是他與讀者互動，而非《蘋果》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，張志偉的訊息指「老闆話題會圍繞港版國安法」，是否張提出建議？黎則稱原本是自己提出，而不是張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2020年7月6日，張志偉向群組傳送一系列宣傳 Live Chat 的連結。至7月7日，黎與張志偉透過訊息溝通，當中提到黎的私人公司職員 Lucia 提議的話題。惟黎稱觀眾的提問才是節目的「話題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎以蘋果twitter帳戶錄製直播&quot;&gt;控方：黎以《蘋果》Twitter帳戶錄製直播&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，首次 Twitter Live 是在7月9日播出。當日時任英文版主筆馮偉光（筆名盧峯）和張劍虹分別在英文版群組中，表達對節目的意見，其中馮指節目猶如「獨白」。黎其後回應，提議日後節目可以邀請外國學者對談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，其後第二至四次直播分別在7月17日、7月23日及7月30日進行，期間訊息顯示黎獲告知所有流程安排、由職員 Lucia 準備的問題、推送通知（push notifications）和直播畫面截圖等，可見節目涉及《蘋果》。黎同意，但補充 Lucia 並非《蘋果》的職員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，張志偉在7月30日向黎傳送首四次直播的觀看次數，並指第四次（即7月30日）直播的觀看次數增加，因為黎的個人 Twitter 帳戶轉發了該次直播。控方指從中可見直播是使用《蘋果》的 Twitter 帳戶錄製，而黎直到第四次才予以轉載。黎稱不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指蘋果管理層協助節目技術層面-但堅稱live-chat屬其個人節目&quot;&gt;黎指《蘋果》管理層協助節目技術層面 但堅稱Live Chat屬其個人節目&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示張志偉於2020年11月17日的訊息，告知黎將會邀請以色列前副總理夏蘭斯基出席Live Chat 節目。控方指，節目無論從製作、宣傳以至準備展示，全都由《蘋果》員工負責，並且涉及《蘋果》的資源，而這也是《蘋果》管理層之間的共識。黎則稱共識只限於在英文版群組裡的管理層。控方續指，Live Chat 其實屬於《蘋果》的節目。惟黎堅稱：「這是我的節目」，而《蘋果》使用它及支持它。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問及，《蘋果》的管理層是否同意協助黎製作節目，而黎同意他們將節目上載至《蘋果》的平台？黎同意。控方指，由此可見，Live Chat 節目的確與《蘋果》管理層有關。黎指他們的確有參與和涉及節目的技術層面，但是黎堅稱這是他的個人節目。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 2019年7月1日示威者佔領立法會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎佔立會示威者僅破壞具象徵性物品-作為抗議政府姿態&quot;&gt;黎：佔立會示威者僅破壞具象徵性物品 作為抗議政府姿態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2019年7月1日示威者闖進立法會之後，張志偉向黎傳送數張相關照片。黎同意該些是示威者作出的暴力行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及黎於2019年7月10日在美國出席「保衛民主基金會」（Foundation for Defense of Democracies，簡稱FDD）的對談講座。期間黎形容示威者破壞了一些東西，但是造成的破壞是很小，加上破壞的手法是作為抗議政府的象徵式姿態，這不是破壞的意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑黎聲稱示威者沒有意圖破壞的說法。黎則解釋，示威者是有意圖破壞，但是相關意圖並非純粹破壞，而是作為一個抗議政府的象徵，大樓內亦有很多東西沒有被破壞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎將佔領立會事件形容為沒有意圖，因為黎想令事件聽起來沒那麼暴力，以避免失去國際支持。黎則稱講座上的言論只是反映他對形勢的判斷。法官杜麗冰指，黎叫陳梓華聯絡勇武派，希望他們平息暴力，黎亦不希望香港失去國際支持，並且減低事件的暴力程度，「這不是你會下意識地做的事嗎？」黎則稱當時只是道出事實，又重申示威者並沒有觸碰任何貴重的物品，只是破壞一些具象徵性的物品，例如塗污往屆立法會主席的相片、打破玻璃和塗鴉口號等，作為抗議政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問，黎認同示威者這樣做嗎？黎否認。控方又問，黎想市民同情示威者？黎同意，又表示：「我認為這是暴力行為，但不是極端暴力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不認同勇武派受訪言論-但允許蘋果發布報導&quot;&gt;黎稱不認同勇武派受訪言論 但允許《蘋果》發布報導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年10月9日的《蘋果》報導〈和變勇 「是政權，迫我進化」〉，內容提及兩名本來是「和理非」的示威者，受訪稱因為政府不回應訴求及警察暴力執法，而逐漸變成「勇武」示威者。當中一條副標題為「最初怕犯法 現在不怕死」，控方問黎是否欲透過報導來激使讀者使用暴力和憎恨政府？黎否認，稱這只是一篇訪問。控方問，《蘋果》是否支持受訪者觀點？黎否認，強調《蘋果》發布訪問不代表就支持相關觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又提到，報紙版面上方的橫條有「官迫民反」四字，問《蘋果》是否認同相關觀點？黎稱同意。至於他本人是否認同，黎則稱沒有思考過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年11月15日報導〈屠龍隊邊緣呼喚全民勇武／三罷〉，提及：「四名屠龍成員接受《蘋果》專訪，認為要緩解前線壓力甚至取得勝利，必須在全民勇武或全民三罷中二擇其一。」黎稱文章僅報導受訪者所說的言論，作為傳媒只是訪問及反映受訪者的說法，而讀者自有他們的判斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到其中一張相片為四名受訪者的合照，下方含有描述：「8月初屠龍隊才成軍，是真正走在最前線、無畏無懼的示威者。」控方質疑《蘋果》有意美化「屠龍隊」；黎否認美化，並堅稱只是描述他們是誰，沒有鼓吹任何東西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在盤問下，黎表示同意「三罷」，但他不認同受訪者提議「必須在全民勇武或全民三罷中二擇其一」，並表示：「我認為這是有點兒瘋狂。」控方質疑，黎沒有要求員工不要發布報導，並允許他們發布一些他不認同的內容？黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎沒有叫受訪者不要使用暴力，再者《蘋果》有他們的聯絡方法，可是黎卻沒有要求員工聯絡他們、籲他們停止使用暴力。黎則稱他沒有受訪者的聯絡方法，而且他沒有責任在每次訪問中勸說他們。控方質疑，黎早前卻要求陳梓華聯絡勇武派以平息暴力？黎指因為陳屬於勇武派的群體之中。控方指，黎透過《蘋果》來煽惑人們使用暴力。黎表示：「完全不同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8yU4CDI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎沒譴責暴力-黎認沒譴責暴力-但認為暴力應該受控&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎沒譴責暴力 黎認沒譴責暴力 但認為暴力應該受控&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續向黎出示2019年12月24日其個人專欄文章〈我們堅持下去才有希望〉，當中提及：「那天跟陳日君樞機談起，他說要避免滲透，勇武派是時候組織領袖團隊，有了領袖團隊便有了原則和勇武的底線，滲透者的過激行動便輕易被揭發，因而想利用我們的運動作為權鬥的彈藥就難以得逞。勇武的手足們，請考慮一下陳樞機的意見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，從上文可見，黎並不只是想減弱示威者暴力，而是希望勇武派組織領袖團隊，使他們能夠維持某程度的暴力。黎否認這樣說過。控方追問，但是黎沒有譴責過暴力？黎同意他沒有譴責過暴力，但是他認為暴力應該受控。控方續指，黎並沒有說過要停止暴力。黎則稱他說過需要底線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，若果黎直接籲「停止暴力」，不是更加簡單嗎？黎則稱這樣說的話不會有效，勇武派不會聆聽。控方指，黎乃希望示威者能繼續以暴力的方法示威。黎重申他是希望勇武派有領袖團隊，訂立原則和底線。控方指黎的意思是認同以暴力手段示威，但是暴力程度應是受控的？黎回答，至少是受控的程度，而不是超越界限。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提議，黎有意透過文章來煽惑其他人使用暴力。黎否認，又指從文章中看不到任何關於煽惑暴力的內容，批評控方：「你編造故事。」控方代表周天行則說，重點不是他有沒有編造故事，而是黎需要基於問題而直接回答同意或不同意，以免浪費法庭時間。黎聽罷反駁：「我認為你最好不要透過編造故事來浪費法庭時間。」控方接著反駁時，法官李運騰打斷，指應交由法庭作出相關判斷。控方最後指出，黎藉文章引起市民對政府的憎恨、藐視和不滿。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭前，李官問及控方盤問進度。周天行表示對於盤問能夠在3月中完成感到樂觀，又稱有可能提早完成。李官表示很高興聽到控方這樣說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of its final acts, the Biden administration introduced what may be the most ambitious exercise of technological statecraft in modern history—the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion (AI Diffusion Rule). What was once a simple line drawn around China and a small handful of countries has turned into a sweeping, interventionist framework that dictates not just who can import advanced semiconductors and how many, but where they can be deployed, under what conditions they must be secured, and even how AI capabilities can be shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unpacking-the-us-calculus&quot;&gt;Unpacking the U.S. Calculus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the framework is a carefully modulated equation, attempting to balance multiple, often competing variables in a single formula. On the one hand, the United States needs to prevent the diversion of advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to China, increasingly through third countries, to ensure that China never reaches escape velocity in the AI race. DeepSeek may have tilted the board, but the equation holds—China still faces stubborn compute bottlenecks in inference scaling and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the exponential growth in compute demand makes it neither practical nor expedient to limit AI infrastructure to U.S. soil. American and allied firms must expand overseas, but every new deployment introduces an additional vector for diversion. This tension is further complicated by market dynamics. U.S. and allied hyperscalers and neocloud providers operate on economic logic, not national security priorities. They will naturally gravitate toward locations where power is cheap, infrastructure hurdles are minimal, and financial incentives sweeten the deal. But for the United States, these same AI-friendly jurisdictions may not always be reliably aligned with its priorities, nor can they be easily insulated from Beijing’s reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-three-tiered-framework-first-class-coach-and-no-ticket&quot;&gt;The Three-Tiered Framework: First-Class, Coach, and No Ticket&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Diffusion Rule introduces a three-tiered framework for AI access. Tier 1 (T1) countries ride first-class, with near-frictionless access to advanced GPUs. Tier 2 (T2) nations, by contrast, are stuck in coach—allowed on the train but kept at a distance from the front cabin—facing strict caps on GPU access. This is an admission of the practical limits of enforcement. Rather than trying to police every node, the rule seeks instead to depressurize the flow of compute globally so there is less surplus floating around that could eventually find its way to China. T2 companies that sever supply chain ties with China and meet stringent compliance standards, however, can import and deploy more GPUs. Together, these controls aim to funnel advanced GPUs into narrow, auditable corridors. The stated objective, however, is clear: to keep T2 countries at least a generation behind the frontier, which the rule defines as 10²⁶ FLOP—an order of magnitude beyond the current capability threshold of 10²⁵ FLOP, where models like GPT-4, Gemini 1 Ultra, and Claude 3 Opus operate. In other words, an upgrade to business class is possible, but first-class is off-limits. Meanwhile, Tier 3 (T3) countries like China are left on the platform, locked out entirely, forced to find their own slower track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-firewall-with-no-backdoors-a-full-stack-approach-to-diversion&quot;&gt;A Firewall with No Backdoors: A Full-Stack Approach to Diversion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is also taking a full-stack approach to preventing diversion. The framework goes beyond physical hardware controls to close gaps in cloud computing access and cyber theft of model weights, which are the final mathematical parameters that encode an AI system’s learned capabilities. It is not just about controlling where compute flows, but ensuring that wherever it is deployed, it remains securely barricaded and tethered to U.S. regulatory oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-collateral-damage-on-allies-and-partners&quot;&gt;The Collateral Damage on Allies and Partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Diffusion Rule is a technocratic tour de force, but at what cost? Observers tend to stall on the obvious, first-order questions. Can Huawei and domestic firms backfill for NVIDIA? Not in the short term. Huawei remains at least one to two generations behind both in GPU performance and fabrication capacity. Will frontline NATO allies like Poland and the Baltic states feel slighted? Yes, and bitterly so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while the first cracks are easy to spot, the real risk is what follows. How will T2 countries metabolize the rule, adapt to its constraints, and respond in the long run? Countries have now seen the U.S. export control regime grow by the better part of a thousand pages over 30 months and witnessed the once modest and polite fiction of “small yard, high fence” turn into a global regulatory ordinance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, where countries once abided the mailed fist when it was directed against China, they may now recalculate, recognizing that the same grip, once reassuringly distant, can just as easily tighten around their own throats. Well-capitalized AI aspirants in T2 will bristle at the fact that their AI ambitions depend on Washington’s goodwill and that they are being deliberately kept a generation behind the frontier. The presumption that they will meekly accept dependency or permanent subordination is naive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default assumption is that T2 countries will either seek to climb into T1 or drift into China’s orbit. They will of course attempt the former. Political opportunism demands nothing less. But this binary framing overlooks a third, and perhaps more disruptive, possibility: A bloc of T2 nations may collectively chart a “Third Way,” not to rival U.S. technological primacy, but to carve out a functional, mid-tier AI stack that provides sufficient strategic autonomy. “De-risking” is often framed as a Western response to China, but T2 nations may now apply the same logic to Washington. The risk for the United States is not open rebellion. It is the slow, deliberate, and accumulative drift away from U.S. control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another overlooked fracture in the AI Diffusion Rule is how it may incentivize open-source migration as an escape hatch. If an advanced model is trained on U.S.-controlled hardware, its weights are also now subject to U.S. export controls, unless they are open-sourced and made publicly available. This creates an incentive for T2 nations to lean into open-source AI development. Optically, while the United States builds a walled garden, China, through DeepSeek and other initiatives, positions itself as the patron of open-source development. Ironically, the AI Diffusion Framework, meant to lock in American advantage, may instead midwife the very outcome it sought to prevent—an alternate AI stack and increased open-source development where China, as its most prolific contributor, emerges as the de facto leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common rejoinder is that the AI Diffusion Rule only affects a handful of countries, since most global AI data center capacity is already concentrated in the United States and T1 nations. But this grossly understates the fallout for economies like Malaysia, which was on track to become the world’s third-largest data center country by 2026, as well as India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)—nations that had staked their AI ambitions on expanded compute access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reasoning also rests on an implicit assumption that T2 countries do not need as much compute, because few were ever serious AI contenders. Leading AI research only takes place in a narrow corridor of countries (e.g., China, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States). But saying “you were never going to win anyway” is a significantly different proposition from saying “you are not allowed to try.” No one tells a kid in the United States that they cannot be president. Empire operates on the same principle. Its benefits must always seem within reach, even to those who will never grasp them. Otherwise, it will breed resentment, not cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the United States may believe that the risk of AI proliferation is so severe, and the timeline to artificial general intelligence so short (2–3 years), that the cost of alienating T2 nations is an acceptable trade-off. But if the United States is trying to consolidate long-term control over the global AI stack, this approach may be too heavy-handed and self-defeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-the-tiered-framework&quot;&gt;Understanding the Tiered Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;t1-the-inner-circle&quot;&gt;T1: The Inner Circle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T1 comprises 18 countries and reads like a roll call of long-standing allies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five Eyes intelligence partners (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Close Western/NATO allies (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom); or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Semiconductor heavyweights (Taiwan, the Netherlands, Japan, and South Korea).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like all alliances, the omissions are as telling as the inclusions. Not all of “Old Europe” or NATO made the cut—Greece and Portugal are missing. More strikingly, Poland, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania are conspicuously absent, despite their vigorous support for U.S. security initiatives, especially in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This partial listing underscores that unofficially, there is a secondary filter. It is not enough to be a stalwart ally on paper; to guarantee lockstep compliance, the United States wants partners whose re-export controls and enforcement frameworks mirror its own. For Washington, even otherwise-dependable allies may fall short if they lack the institutional capacity, enforcement rigor, and willingness to guarantee strict adherence, or if they are viewed as potential diversion risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;t2-eclectic-middle-ground&quot;&gt;T2: Eclectic Middle Ground&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lion’s share of nations fall into T2, a catch-all group that lumps together an eclectic mix of countries with vastly different levels of trust, capacity, and AI ambitions. India, Israel, Singapore, and Switzerland are placed alongside Yemen. There are several reasons why countries may have ended up in T2. Some, like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have emerged as key investors in AI but remain outside the Western intelligence-sharing orbit. Others, such as India, are forging close strategic and trade ties with the United States but have a legacy of nonalignment. Switzerland, with its long-standing tradition of fierce neutrality, fits a similar mold. Meanwhile, countries in Southeast Asia and those in Eastern Europe that are officially close U.S. partners have been flagged as diversion risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;t3-the-usual-suspects&quot;&gt;T3: The Usual Suspects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T3 is a familiar roster of U.S. arms-embargoed countries—China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, joined by the likes of Burma (Myanmar), Syria, and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t1-access-and-restrictions&quot;&gt;T1 Access and Restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T1 countries will have unrestricted access to advanced GPUs. Companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent in a T1 country can deploy as much computing power as they want within T1 nations. Through a one-time Universal Validated End User (UVEU) authorization, they can also deploy GPUs in T2 countries, albeit within certain limits. Beyond access to hardware, the rule also ring-fences the training of frontier models in T1 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even T1 status comes with conditions. U.S.-headquartered companies must keep at least 50 percent of total AI compute in the United States, 75 percent in T1 countries overall, and no more than 7 percent in any single T2 country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers are striking. But based on data from the AI and semiconductor research firm SemiAnalysis, the bulk of AI data center capacity is already concentrated in the United States and T1 countries—over 50 percent in the United States alone and more than 75 percent across T1 nations. SemiAnalysis further projects 10+ gigawatt (GW)-scale campuses coming online in the United States over the next two years, reinforcing its lead. Figure 2 shows the stark regional disparities in planned data center capacity through 2027, with North America dominating global capacity—roughly four times larger than either Europe and the Middle East or Asia Pacific, while Latin America trails behind for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To qualify, however, companies must meet 19 separate certification and policy requirements, covering everything from GPU installation reporting and transit security to personnel vetting, monitoring, recordkeeping, and even sanitization and disposal procedures. The strictest requirements revolve around cybersecurity controls for model weights, mandating rate-limiting on data access and restricting interactions to narrowly defined application programming interfaces (APIs) to prevent rapid exfiltration and unauthorized probing of models through interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, UVEUs must follow “know your customer” (KYC) and red flag guidance, including notifying authorities when training an advanced model. The primary concern is subsidiaries conducting large-scale training runs above the prescribed threshold (i.e., 10²⁶ FLOP) and then transferring model weights to China. Collectively, these safeguards are designed to prevent GPU diversion, unauthorized access, and the theft of model weights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For companies that clear these hurdles, the payoff is substantial: a near-universal hall pass, granting broad authorization to scale AI infrastructure worldwide. UVEUs will also be exempt from the restrictions on model weights—which, under the rules of the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), otherwise require a license to export, re-export, or even transfer within a country—provided the destination is a T1 country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t2-access-and-restrictions&quot;&gt;T2 Access and Restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS has imposed country-level caps on advanced GPUs for T2 nations, measured by total processing performance (TPP), a metric quantifying aggregate compute capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, TPP is abstract and lacks immediate real-world clarity. As such, a conversion method is often employed to translate TPP into a more tangible benchmark—NVIDIA’s H100 equivalents, the current industry standard for AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each T2 country receives a fixed allocation of 49,901 H100-equivalent GPUs through 2027. This is not an annual quota—once exhausted, whether in 2025 or 2026, no additional GPUs can be imported until after 2027. To accommodate smaller-scale needs, BIS allows T2 entities to acquire up to 1,699 H100-equivalents without a license, though they must notify BIS. These purchases do not count toward the 49,901 H100-equivalent installed base cap, offering flexibility for low-volume imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-shrinking-reality-of-50000-and-1700-gpu-caps&quot;&gt;The Shrinking Reality of 50,000 and 1,700 GPU Caps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, an allocation of ~50,000 H100-equivalent GPUs, which would cost roughly $1.25 billion, appears substantial—roughly more than double the compute used to train GPT-4, which was trained on roughly 25,000 less-performant A100 chips. However, the H100 will soon become a previous-generation chip, set to be replaced in 2025 by NVIDIA’s newer B200 and GB300 GPUs. When the permitted TPP is converted into these next-generation units using numbers from SemiAnalysis, the effective number of GPUs shrinks—from 50,000 H100s to 21,987 B200s, and then 13,192 GB300s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This downward trend accelerates when accounting for hardware improvement rates. According to Epoch AI, ML hardware performance has doubled every 1.9 years, meaning that by 2027, a 13,192 GB300 allocation will be effectively reduced by half. Similarly, the seemingly permissive ~1,700 H100 threshold for small purchases translates to fewer than 500 GB300 GPUs and an even smaller number of 2027-equivalents. These calculations reveal how quickly nominally generous caps become more restrictive, limiting the compute available to T2 nations in practice. It is worth noting that future hardware performance is uncertain. NVIDIA’s generational leaps might yield larger or smaller performance gains than projected and come sooner or later than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-t2-countries-can-increase-their-caps&quot;&gt;How T2 Countries Can Increase Their Caps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies from T2 countries looking to deploy a significant number of GPUs can apply for a National Validated End User (NVEU) authorization, provided they meet stringent security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By so doing, they receive an export license allowing a phased-in installed base of up to approximately 100,000 H100 equivalents by the end of 2025, 270,000 by the end of 2026, and 320,000 by the end of 2027. Again, these are not trivial numbers. 100,000 H100s is three times larger than the compute capacity of xAI’s Colossus supercomputer facility in Memphis, Tennessee, the largest U.S. GPU cluster in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as discussed earlier, these caps shrink dramatically when accounting for hardware improvements. When the allocation is converted, the 320,000 H100 equivalents allowed drops to 140,666 B200 equivalents and 84,400 GB300 equivalents. Factoring in hardware improvements—i.e., doubling every 1.9 years—this number shrinks even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jrjKfLM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to obtain NVEU status, T2 applicants are “strongly encouraged” to first secure a government-to-government assurance before seeking approval from four federal agencies—the Departments of Commerce, State, Defense, and Energy. While UVEU applicants must also clear this multi-agency review, T2 firms face structural disadvantages compared to T1 hyperscalers and neoclouds, which already operate within established compliance frameworks, observability systems, and security protocols, making many of the requirements routine. In addition, T2 NVEU applicants will also face heightened scrutiny in demonstrating efforts to sever supply chain dependencies with China. While not all countries are equally exposed, many have integrated Chinese networking equipment and hardware into their infrastructure due to cost advantages, making compliance both technically complex and costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t3-access-and-restrictions&quot;&gt;T3 Access and Restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a presumption of denial for all T3 countries—in regulatory parlance, that means an automatic “no” for any export license applications involving T3 entities. None of the streamlined “VEU” routes (universal or national) apply. In principle, a T3 company cannot just waltz through licensing hoops—it is effectively shut out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uneven-impact-of-the-ai-diffusion-rule&quot;&gt;The Uneven Impact of the AI Diffusion Rule&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of the rule will, unsurprisingly, be uneven. While it is tempting to cast T1 as the “winners” and T2 as the “losers,” this would be an oversimplification. Even within each tier, the outcomes will be far from uniform—some T1 countries will gain disproportionately, while others in T2 will feel the brunt of the restrictions more acutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, some T2 countries may benefit under the new rules. For instance, entities in parts of the Middle East and Central Asia—where any chip purchase previously required an export license—now have pathways to access controlled chips without a license, provided they stay within the bounds of low-volume purchase pathways (LPPs) or individual country allocations. Countries like the UAE, which spent months negotiating deals such as the Microsoft-G42 partnership and has already secured a memorandum of understanding with the United States, will welcome the added clarity and are well-positioned to obtain an NVEU status. Conversely, other T2 nations that previously faced no restrictions will now find their access significantly tightened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, the new rule is likely to be a net negative for T2 nations with significant AI data center capacity pipelines, particularly if that capacity is not slated for use by U.S. hyperscalers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;biggest-losers&quot;&gt;Biggest Losers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on SemiAnalysis data, Malaysia will be the hardest-hit country. Its data center capacity has been surging, rising from just 100 megawatts (MW) in 2023 to a projected ~3.5 GW by 2027, and positioning it to become the world’s third-largest data center country, behind the United States and China, by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of Malaysia’s projected 2027 capacity is optimized for cutting-edge NVIDIA AI accelerators, with facilities capable of supporting power densities of up to 130 kilowatts (kW) per rack. This has drawn major investments, including NVIDIA’s $4.3 billion partnership with Malaysian conglomerate YTL to build supercomputing facilities and cloud AI services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaysia is likely to get caught in the crosshairs of the rule as it become a key destination for Chinese colocation and leasing activities. By 2027, ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, is expected to lease 628 MW of its total data center capacity. Similarly, DayOne (formerly GDS) is adding 415 MW by 2026, much of which is leased to ByteDance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle finds itself in a bind—hence the escalating blog posts from Executive Vice President Ken Glueck on December 19, January 5, and February 4. Oracle’s strategy relied heavily on Malaysia, with $6.5 billion in planned investments that will likely exceed the new 7 percent country cap for T2 nations. While it could theoretically rebalance through aggressive expansion in T1 countries, this would require significant new investment and strategic repositioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Malaysia, India will be the hardest-hit county. However, unlike Malaysia, India’s AI infrastructure is more closely tied to U.S. hyperscalers, offering some insulation from the restrictions. Still, with ~3 GW of planned data center capacity, India closely rivals Malaysia in scale, but has even larger ambitions. Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest person and chairman of Reliance Industries, recently announced plans to build a 3 GW mega data center campus in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which would be the world’s largest, with a projected investment of $20–30 billion. The facility is intended for AI workloads and is expected to rely on NVIDIA’s leading-edge Blackwell AI processors. The new restrictions threaten to derail these initiatives, potentially thwarting India’s aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Malaysia, Southeast Asia overall is likely to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore was an early mover in the data center boom of the 2000s, leveraging its connectivity infrastructure. But its energy constraints quickly caught up. In 2019, Singapore imposed a moratorium on new data centers after projections showed they could consume 12 percent of the nation’s electricity by 2030. Since then, Singapore has allocated modest expansions—80 MW for four new data centers by 2023 and a 2024 pledge to add 300 MW, prioritizing green energy options. Given its fundamental constraints, however, Singapore’s growth will remain capped, relying on reshuffling its deck to retire legacy facilities and optimize existing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, meanwhile, is less handicapped by similar limitations and has been muscling in on the AI data center space. It recently completed Phase 1 of the BDx CGK4 campus in Jatiluhur—a renewable-powered AI data center park, scalable up to 500 MW, offering high power density of up to 120 kW per rack, liquid cooling technologies, and high-speed connectivity to meet the demands of AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s ample land, energy, and ability to leverage renewable power have also made it a natural magnet for Chinese investment, with Tencent Holdings pledging $500 million to develop its third data center in the country by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil will be the most affected country in Latin America and has positioned itself as a regional AI data center powerhouse. Leading the charge is Scala Data Centers, whose São Paulo campus is set to expand beyond 350 MW, but its real centerpiece is the so-called AI City—a proposed 4.75 GW campus that will cost upward of $90 billion. Ordinarily, such a proposal would be laughed out of the room, but the proposed site is located next to an idle 3 GW substation and surrounded by untapped wind and hydro power, resources that few other nations can match. With the right financial backing, it could be the largest AI data center in the world. The new U.S. restrictions would, however, significantly undercut these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the UAE and Saudi Arabia show relatively small confirmed capacities through 2027, this understates their long-term aspirations, with several gigawatt-scale projects that extend well beyond 2027. Most, however, have not yet started earthworks. The Gulf states possess two distinct advantages: huge energy reserves and the ability to deploy state-backed capital with near-limitless patience to build the next generation of AI data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near-term development is led by G42/Khazna, with 406 MW of planned capacity across 13 campuses, including a flagship 100 MW Dubai Ajman campus. However, its true ambitions are reflected in its longer-term plans. According to SemiAnalysis, G42/Khazna is planning a staggering 5 GW aggregate pipeline across the Middle East, while Google is eyeing a 3 GW pipeline near Saudi Arabia’s King Salman Energy Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;biggest-winners&quot;&gt;Biggest Winners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the AI Diffusion Rule does not create outright “winners,” apart from the United States, which by design will be the primary beneficiary, T1 countries’ AI infrastructure plans will not be at risk and can proceed without regulatory headwinds. In addition, they are likely to siphon off deployments originally earmarked for T2 nations now caught in the rule’s constraints. Based on SemiAnalysis data, Australia emerges as a standout case among T1 nations, followed by the United Kingdom, Japan, Ireland, Germany, Canada, South Korea, the Netherlands, and Spain. In fact, nine out of eighteen T1 countries have more than 1 GW of planned AI data center capacity, compared to just four countries across all T2 countries, with five T1 countries exceeding 2 GW of planned capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia will likely be the largest beneficiary of the rule, particularly in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, with its ~3 GW of planned capacity. Australia’s energy landscape provides a crucial competitive advantage. Unlike Japan and South Korea, which rely heavily on imported energy, Australia is one of the world’s largest energy exporters. Australia’s consistent year-round solar irradiation also translates directly to data center economics, enabling cost-effective power purchase agreements (PPAs) for data center operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, colocation accounts for approximately 75 percent of Australia’s market. While hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, and AWS can self-build and operate their own facilities, colocation providers offer a compelling alternative: ready-to-use data center facilities that cloud providers can quickly lease, which means lower capital requirements and faster time to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian market is anchored by three mature colocation providers that rank among the world’s best—the “three Goliaths”: AirTrunk, NextDC, and Canberra Data Centers (CDC). NextDC’s 550 MW mega campus demonstrates its capacity for large-scale development, while the ability of AirTrunk, a homegrown success story, to deploy direct-to-chip liquid cooling is particularly significant as the industry faces a big transition: NVIDIA’s upcoming Blackwell AI chips (GB200) require this advanced cooling technology to handle power densities up to 130 kW per rack. Many data center operators globally, including tech giant Meta, have had to completely redesign facilities to accommodate these new requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What truly distinguishes the “three Goliaths” is their focus—instead of serving a broad mix of enterprise clients, they primarily build for hyperscale cloud providers—and already well understand their exacting technical requirements and scaling needs. Combined with its privileged T1 status under the new rules, Australia is ideally positioned to capture displaced AI computing demand from restricted Southeast Asian markets like Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-theory-of-success-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;The Theory of Success for the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Diffusion Rule will funnel T2 countries toward U.S. hyperscalers and allied T1 neoclouds as the default gateway to advanced compute, which the U.S. largely controls, creating a de facto lock-in of AI infrastructure worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule is not just about controlling who gets access to U.S. compute; it is also about forcing countries to choose sides. In order to secure U.S. compute, T2 NVEU applicants will also have to sever supply chain dependencies with China—i.e., they need to declare for Washington and eject Beijing, or risk falling behind. But company-level decoupling will not suffice; securing U.S. approval will require formal government assurances at the national level to get into Washington’s good graces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;creating-economic-pressure-the-approval-gap-between-uveu-and-nveu&quot;&gt;Creating Economic Pressure: The Approval Gap Between UVEU and NVEU&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the path to securing NVEU status appears straightforward, as highlighted previously, the process presents significant practical hurdles that could create dangerous delays for countries with ambitious AI data center plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many projects, like those in Malaysia, are purpose-built for top-end AI training, with ultra-dense power racks, advanced liquid cooling, and infrastructure optimized for next-generation chips like NVIDIA’s Blackwell line. Yet, even with an NVEU license, TPP limitations and supply constraints may prevent operators from acquiring enough state-of-the-art GPUs to fill those racks. Meanwhile, Tier 1 license holders face a 7 percent limit on how much of their total compute can be deployed in any single country, creating further uncertainty for T2 data centers looking to secure large clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operators could repurpose racks for older GPUs, but these do not require the high-density cooling and power infrastructure already in place, turning specialized, high-capex facilities into underutilized white elephants. A retrofit for lower-performance workloads also undermines the original investment altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the economics are unforgiving. Modern data center projects require billions in upfront capital expenditure—from land acquisition and power infrastructure to advanced cooling systems. These investments are typically highly leveraged, with financing structures that assume rapid customer deployment to generate cash flow for debt service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even short delays awaiting NVEU approval leave these specialized facilities vulnerable. Loan payments may come due without corresponding revenue from AI workloads, but incurring the same fixed costs for maintenance, security, and staff. For operators and investors, the choice will be clear. Unfilled racks mean certain losses. They will likely lease to T1 hyperscalers who can deploy immediately under UVEU status, or risk their facilities becoming stranded assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lock-in-effects&quot;&gt;Lock-In Effects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework effectively drives T2 compute capacity toward U.S. hyperscalers and T1 neoclouds, which gain preferential access to T2 markets. But the implications go beyond just access to compute. Hyperscalers and neoclouds also offer stable service-level agreements and robust developer ecosystems (e.g., CUDA libraries), with better track records for uptime, enterprise-grade support, and compliance. Over time, the cost and friction of switching to alternative providers like Huawei would become prohibitively high. Migrating datasets, restructuring technical operations, retraining staff, and rebuilding applications would impose significant costs and operational challenges, reinforcing lock-in effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;potential-response-from-china-and-allies&quot;&gt;Potential Response from China and Allies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-hardware-gap-chinas-compute-gap&quot;&gt;The Hardware Gap: China’s Compute Gap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumption that China can immediately compensate for U.S. controls with domestic alternatives is not supportable with current evidence. In the near term, China faces significant constraints in both the quality and quantity of chips it can produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Huawei’s Ascend series and other Chinese GPU alternatives lag behind NVIDIA by one to two generations. According to Chris Miller, Huawei’s most advanced AI chip, the Ascend 910B, achieves only 280–400 TeraFLOPS compared to 2,250 TeraFLOPS for NVIDIA’s most advanced Blackwell chips. This performance differential of 5.6–8x is reflected in real-world adoption. According to Epoch AI, of 263 documented AI models where hardware was known, only two used Huawei Ascend chips, while 31 Chinese organizations relied on NVIDIA hardware. Even DeepSeek trained its models on NVIDIA H800s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantity Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; SemiAnalysis projects that China will produce just 1.8 million Huawei Ascend 910B/910C GPUs by the end of 2025, while U.S. AI labs and hyperscalers are projected to deploy 14.3 million AI accelerators in the United States, which are significantly more performant, suggesting an even larger compute gap at the aggregate national level. This limited fabrication capacity means that China will likely prioritize domestic needs, limiting their ability to offer a credible alternative to U.S. technology in global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth cautioning that this technology gap may not be permanent. In the medium to long term, forced localization and state-backed capital might narrow China’s performance gap from one generation behind to on par or slightly behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;second-tier-status-first-tier-ambitions&quot;&gt;Second-Tier Status, First-Tier Ambitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T2 countries will, of course, publicly acquiesce to U.S. restrictions. But diplomatic accommodation should not be mistaken for genuine alignment. India, the Gulf states, and other well-capitalized AI aspirants will bristle in private that their AI ambitions depend on Washington’s goodwill. The fact that T2 nations are being deliberately kept a generation behind the frontier will also rankle. It is a public, institutionalized reminder that no matter how much they invest, they are not allowed to be first-tier players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-false-binary-the-united-states-vs-china-vs-a-third-way&quot;&gt;The False Binary: The United States vs. China vs. a Third Way&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a tendency to view AI geopolitics through a Cold War–style binary—that nations must either align with the United States or drift into China’s orbit. But this overlooks a third possibility that T2 nations, far from being passive satellites, may seek their own path. T2 nations have no desire to be entirely captive to either the United States or China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 is often cited as China’s “9/11 moment,” when the Huawei and ZTE sanctions forced Beijing to embark on a massive technological self-sufficiency push. The AI Diffusion Rule may trigger a similar reckoning for T2 countries. One may argue that the two are not analogous. After all, Beijing was explicitly cut off, while T2 countries still receive a permissive allocation under the new framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that misses the underlying dynamic. No country makes economic security decisions on the basis of GPUs alone. Increasingly muscular U.S. economic security measures, especially against close allies like Canada, will force capitals to rethink long-term dependencies on U.S. technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;short-term-adjustments-long-term-realignment&quot;&gt;Short-Term Adjustments, Long-Term Realignment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this will not happen overnight. In the near term, T2 nations will maximize their initial allocation of 50,000 H100-equivalent GPUs. Given that access is first come, first served, sovereign AI initiatives will ramp up—governments will ensure national priorities dictate GPU access, rather than individual firms. We may also see the rise of regional compute corridors, with nations pooling resources to overcome individual capacity limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the immediate time frame, these countries will likely procure whatever GPUs they can—via U.S.-validated entities (UVEUs) or the narrower NVEU status. As access to U.S. compute becomes increasingly conditional, however, or simply in anticipation of future friction, well-resourced nations will start to invest in their own high-performance computing infrastructure, aiming not to match the raw performance of top-end GPUs—a feat even China struggles with—but to build a functional, mid-tier alternative capable of supporting AI applications. Rather than attempting to replicate leading-edge GPUs, these collaborations could focus on specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed for narrow but critical industrial and commercial AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RISC-V-based AI accelerators, designed collaboratively and manufactured in existing T2 facilities, present another pathway. Unlike proprietary architectures like x86 or Arm—both of which are subject to U.S. restrictions—RISC-V’s open-source nature allows nations to design their own AI accelerators. That said, RISC-V is not an immediate off-ramp. While Alibaba has developed XuanTie RISC-V cores, most RISC-V AI efforts remain in their early stages, requiring significant investment and development. Claiming it as a ready solution for compute sovereignty overstates its current capabilities. But dismissing it entirely would ignore incentives to fast-track progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Washington was already concerned about China’s push for design-out, the risk now multiplies exponentially. By overplaying its hand, the United States creates a potential alternate compute stack, operating beyond American control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-open-source-escape-valve&quot;&gt;The Open-Source Escape Valve&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted earlier, the weights of any model trained using U.S.-controlled compute are subject to U.S. export restrictions if they exceed 10²⁶ FLOP—unless they are open-sourced. At first glance, this creates an incentive for T2 nations to lean into open-source frontier AI development to sidestep U.S. regulatory controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in practice, this escape valve may not be as open as it seems. T2 countries will likely lack the domestic compute capacity to train models beyond 10²⁶ FLOP, meaning they would need to rent compute. But this raises a liability risk—how can a T2 entity credibly prove, before training begins, that it will follow through on open-sourcing the model weights? Without a mechanism to verify intent pre-training, compute providers may simply deny access upfront rather than gamble on post-training compliance. As such, T2 players may find themselves effectively boxed out of both closed- and open-source frontier AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if U.S. restrictions block T2 nations from training frontier open-source models, they may trigger a different kind of shift—an acceleration toward compute-efficient, open-source AI development. DeepSeek has already demonstrated that scarcity breeds optimization. What happens when the broader open-source world, united by shared limitations, begins running in the same direction? There is also a curious inversion at play. While the United States moves to lock down and consolidate global compute, China is positioning itself as the provider of last resort, offering high-quality, cost-effective open-source models that others can build on. Instead of needing access to U.S. AI infrastructure, developers could simply build atop China’s open-source stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T2 states do not need a formal conspiracy with Beijing. But their independent hedging efforts, driven by frustration with U.S. licensing constraints, may naturally dovetail with China’s open-source push. Instead of reinforcing a U.S.-led order, Washington’s grip could weaken and lead to a world where open-source autonomy, championed by China, becomes the default escape hatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-fragile-equilibrium-and-conditions-for-unraveling&quot;&gt;The Fragile Equilibrium and Conditions for Unraveling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By tying advanced compute access to strict controls, Washington risks turning T2 countries into reluctant vassals who start looking for side doors at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory partitions have a half-life. The policy will only hold as long as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compliance burden remains lower than the cost of switching;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternate compute stacks remain too inefficient to offer mid-tier alternative U.S. incumbents; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s domestic AI stack develops more slowly than the United States anticipates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Diffusion Rule assumes that lock-in will hold because switching costs are high. But if history tells us anything, it is that whenever an access-restricted market grows large enough, the incentive to develop alternatives eventually outweighs the costs of remaining dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is more likely than not that the AI Diffusion Rule will be embraced and further expanded by the Trump administration. It aligns with a broader escalation of the China containment playbook, fits neatly into an “America First” approach, and serves as a powerful negotiating cudgel to compel T2 nations to align more closely with Washington’s AI agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But splintering is not inevitable. There are viable policy pathways to preempt T2 strategic drift and allow the United States to maintain control over the global AI stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish Clear Graduation Requirements for T2 Countries:&lt;/strong&gt; If full T1 status is not feasible, Washington should establish a Tier 2A classification for countries with significant AI infrastructure investments at risk of being stranded, and agree to increase export control enforcement efforts. This tier would receive higher country-level TPP allocations and streamlined NVEU approval processes. There could also be an annual revision of TPP thresholds, particularly as large-scale U.S. initiatives such as Project Stargate take off, to allay T2 country anxieties that that they are being deliberately outpaced and falling further behind the compute frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reassert U.S. Leadership in Open-Source AI to Counter China’s Inroads:&lt;/strong&gt; The AI Diffusion Rule unintentionally incentivizes T2 nations to embrace open-source AI. Rather than cede this space, Washington should preemptively shape the open-source landscape to prevent China from becoming its de facto steward. This could take place by incentivizing international AI research collaborations through U.S. university public compute. This would offer structured, monitored access to AI infrastructure for vetted T2 researchers—allowing the United States to maintain influence over who contributes to the global open-source AI stack. In time, the United States could also develop certification standards for “trusted” open-source models that meet security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modernizing BIS and Export Controls Enforcement:&lt;/strong&gt; The streamlined licensing burden on BIS creates an opportunity to reallocate resources toward strengthened enforcement and tracking mechanisms that better prevent circumvention. This would dovetail with the growing digitization drive under the Trump administration. BIS could deploy automated TPP tracking systems that provide real-time visibility into GPU deployments, create standardized APIs for reporting and monitoring, and build automated early warning systems for potential diversion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the United States has crossed the Rubicon, and there is no retreat. China will continue its drive for AI self-sufficiency regardless of U.S. actions. But export controls are like self-replicating automata. They tend to expand with each iteration, creating new loopholes, countermeasures, and pressures for escalation. A more adaptive approach, however—one that balances U.S. leadership with credible pathways for allies—could allow Washington to have its cake and eat it too. If there is a better hand to play, now is the time to find it. And if there is anyone that thrives on breaking and remaking the playbook, it is President Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

However, early on the Russians found that fighting back the armed opposition would be easier than reforming the Assad regime and turning it back into a self-sustaining entity.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Even though Russia continued trying to reform the regime and especially its armed forces, some of its initiatives turned out to be counterproductive. This was largely because Russia refused to accept the fact that the regime was uninterested in reform. As Assad sought to prevent the Russians from promoting Syrian officers, whom they deemed to be fit for the purpose of running the military more effectively, the net result was the creation of a Russian patronage system within the Syrian security establishment, which rivaled an Assad-centered one (and, incidentally, an emerging Iran-centered one).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradually, the Russians became more and more critical of the regime and its armed forces. Their efforts to get Bashar al Assad to hand over power to a more widely accepted figure in 2017-18 also contributed to increasing distrust of Moscow within the regime. In addition, the Syrians resented increasingly obvious Russian efforts to invest all their resources in their own Syrian network, at the expense of the rest of the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian commentary on the state of the Syrian armed forces from 2019 onward casted doubt on the regime’s ability, in the event of a significant challenge, to survive on its own. The Assad regime was aware of the risk, as well, but it seems to have identified the main threat as entanglement in the Israel-Palestine-Iran conflict. There was, however, some optimism in Damascus that diplomatic reintegration into the Arab world would go ahead and that eventually Damascus would cease being dependent on Russian (and Iranian) support. While the Russians likely had less than Iran to fear from a Syrian rapprochement with the Gulf monarchies, Moscow seems nonetheless to have resented the Assad regime’s efforts to contain Russian influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s heavy engagement in Ukraine from 2022 onward had an impact on its commitments in Syria, although initially not a very big one. It was only in late 2023-early 2024 that Russia started heavily cutting funding and support for the Syrians. Driving this were not just accumulating costs of the war in Ukraine; it is also clear that specific Russo-Syrian dynamics were at play, in particular a Syrian crackdown on prominent pro-Russian officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the exact weight of different factors, the Russians implemented much harsher cuts to their support, leaving the Syrian armed forces starved of funding and logistics. Yet the Assad regime did not yield to the pressure. The result was a critical situation as the end of 2024 approached. The Russo-Syrian falling-out can thus be argued to have contributed decisively to the regime’s collapse. It remained unclear at the time of this writing whether the Russians deliberately weakened the regime in order to force Assad to come to terms with Türkiye, as wished by Moscow, or whether relations between Moscow and Damascus simply went awry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researching this topic required a number of methodological compromises, given that conducting primary research in Syria was extremely difficult until 2024. There are other obvious limitations to the research methodology adopted, with research by necessity mostly limited to oral sources, with support from the literature and news reports, but no access to primary written sources: the body of data collected is inevitably incomplete; gaps abound, and following up on specific themes was often impossible. The analysis contained in the paper inevitably reflects this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the oral sources proved to be quite approachable. The risk inherent in this type of research is therefore not obtaining access. There are other risks, however: that interviewees might be affected by a social-desirability bias, resulting in overstating their achievements, capabilities and/or resources; or by reverse causation, leading sources to provide prejudiced information about rival organizations. Mitigation measures are discussed below. The research methodology was a hybrid of investigative journalism and ethnographic interviews. The questionnaires were adapted to each interviewee; there were, in fact, as many different questionnaires as there were interviews. The questions evolved as knowledge of ongoing trends and developments expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the researchers have a background in journalism and/or research, had participated in previous research projects with a similar typology of interviewees and have been trained to undertake research with a similar methodology. The interviews were commissioned to local researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk that respondents might use the interviews to influence external observers or misrepresent the facts was assumed from the start. It was mitigated by using different types of interviewees – such as government officials and military officers, Iranian and Russian officers and diplomats, members of militias – who represented contrasting points of view; by interviewing individuals separately and without their being aware of other interviews taking place; and by inserting questions to which the answer was already known, in order to verify responses. It proved particularly helpful to present interviewees with information gathered from other sources. Public-domain sources, such as media reports and analytical studies, were also used, where available, to check the credibility of interviewees. Researchers were chosen who did not know each other to avoid the risk of researcher collusion to manipulate the content of interviews, for example, by inventing content to produce whatever they might have believed the project team wanted to hear. This is always a risk when interviews are carried out by field researchers while the project is being managed remotely. The field researchers were also informed that the purpose of the effort was simply to ascertain facts and that there was no premium placed on specific findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviewees were told that their answers would be used in an open-access publication, the type of which was not specified. The interviews were in part carried out face-to-face and in part over the phone – some interviewees were in locations that were difficult to access. All the interviews have been anonymized and all data that could lead to the identification of interviewees has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, the paper relies on 30 interviews, carried out between 2016 and 2024. Of these, 14 were with Syrian military personnel, 10 with Syrian officials, three with Russian diplomats and military advisors, two with Iranian advisors from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and one with an official translator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia-and-the-syrian-armed-forces&quot;&gt;Russia and the Syrian armed forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-ambitions-in-2015&quot;&gt;Russia’s ambitions in 2015&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia intervened in Syria in 2015, Putin set out as an aim to “stabilize the legitimate authorities”. Indeed, Russian army advisers to the Syrian government lobbied the Assad regime to focus on rebuilding the Syrian army, which had been greatly weakened in 2011-15. The Russians might have been motivated by a genuine belief that the militias sponsored by Iran, of which there were plenty and which were doing the bulk of the fighting, were undermining the state. Moreover, the fragmented militias seemed to be of little use for the maneuver warfare, integrated with close air support, that Russian advisers were advocating against the rebels – although this did not rule out continuing to rely on militias for other purposes. Competition with Iran was another motivating factor for Russian policy to build up the Syrian army at the expense of the militias. This was an attempt to increase Russia’s influence at the expense of Iran, whose influence in Syria was largely channeled through militias. As an adviser to Assad noted as early as 2016, soon after their arrival in Syria, the Russians appeared to worry about the concentration of power and influence in the hands of the IRGC, at the expense of their own influence and that of the Syrian state. Indeed, the Russians were soon openly arguing that reestablishing a strong Syrian army would be the best guarantee against Iranian influence and pro-Iranian militias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-obstacles-in-russias-way&quot;&gt;The obstacles in Russia’s way&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2024, the Russian view of the Syrian armed forces was that the Syrian top army leadership was dishonest, corrupt and “not working properly”. Corruption was regularly mentioned as a key factor in the weakness of the Syrian armed forces even by Iranian sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nepotism and patronage are other frequently mentioned issues. The Russians put a lot of pressure on the Assad regime to stop promoting “useless people” in the army, reportedly achieving some success in preventing egregiously nepotistic appointments, but without effecting the removal of the cronies who were already there. Assad never took action, despite the Russians asking for a meeting on this specific issue. The Iranians agreed on this assessment, as well. Reportedly, Qasim Sulimani attributed the problems of the Syrian army to nepotism: “he always said that strengthening the Syrian army is like feeding President Assad’s family; he said they will take all the advantage and abuse it”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even those Russians who thought the Syrian leadership was only a “minor issue” and that “not all” the army leadership was “ineffective”, acknowledged that corruption was widespread, with weapons and fuel being stolen even by senior officers, and that the Syrian government refused to promote “capable officers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the fragmentation of the army chain of command was often raised as a major issue, again by Iranians too. A Russian advisor described the army as “not a real army, and they are all made up of militias that are not strong enough”. As one senior Syrian official put it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Assad has a lot of senor military people who take orders from him; they listen to Assad whether to do operations or not. They do not need to take orders from the minister or the ministry. They are trusted people to Assad, and they are supporting Assad. No one can say something to them in the ministry. If anyone complains, he will lose his job. The number of such people is big, and the minister is against them; he tells them that operations need to be authorized by the ministry. Russia is also unhappy with Assad about this. Russia is telling Assad that when operations take place, it must be done under the chain of command of the Ministry of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Wagner Group sources, which were mentoring and training Syrian forces, described Syrian units as poorly trained and weakly motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-role-in-making-things-worse&quot;&gt;Russia’s role in making things worse&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Russian MoD was for years a keen advocate of rebuilding a strong, unified Syrian army, in the end Russian policies might unwittingly have contributed to the further fragmentation of the chain of command. For example, Russian insistence on creating army units out of reconciled rebels in the south led to the emergence of de facto autonomous units that never took order from Damascus. This, aside from creating tension between Moscow and Damascus, also made the chain of command even more convoluted, with the 8th Brigade of the 5th Corps in particular only responding to the Russians. Although the Syrian MoD tried to assert control over the 8th Brigade after 2022, despite Russia having stopped paying their salaries, it never succeeded in earning the loyalty of the ex-rebels. Its efforts to establish control took the shape of replacing several top officers of the division, which likely weakened its combat capabilities very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the entire 5th Corps was a Russian creation. The Russians conceived it as part of their plan to fold the disparate pro-Assad militias into the regular army in 2016. They funded, provided logistics to and trained the 5th Corps, and they retained a high degree of direct control over it. That became de facto ownership:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The 5th Corps and all its officers and soldiers are part of the Syrian Arab Army, and they got their military uniform and cards from the Syrian Arab Army, but the Russian officers and advisors have direct control and command over all activities, operations and military tasks. The Russian Command is even topping up the salaries of Syrian officers and soldiers. […] The Russian officers issue orders and even decide about the leave of Syrian officers and […]. The Ministry of Defense and the Command of the Syrian Arab Army cannot move a tank or a truck from the 5th Corps without the approval of the Russian officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same applies to the 4th Corps, another one created at Russian instigation in 2015 and kept by the Russians on a tight leash until at least early 2024: “The 4th Corps is not allowed to carry out operations anywhere; they are just allowed in those areas that are under the control of the Russians”. In addition, the attempt to use both corps for assimilating militias was not completely successful. As a Russian diplomat acknowledged, the 4th and 5th corps never turned into “proper armies” and were never able to perform as proper armies,” mostly remaining “just men with weapons”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of the perverse effects of Russian reform efforts is the 25th Division, once known as the Tiger Force militia. The Russians nurtured its commander, Suhail al Hasan, pushed for the militia to be transformed into an elite army unit, and directly funded it and equipped it with some of the most advanced equipment ever delivered to Syrian units by Russia. Until 2022, the Russians were de facto in control of the division. This reinforced the preexisting enmity between Suhail al Hasan and the Assad regime, especially Maher al Assad, further fracturing the chain of command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General Maher al Assad, as all members of aal Assad family, do not like to see a strong and popular officer or leader who is not one of them. General Maher al Assad wanted and still wants to get rid of General Suhail and his 25th Special Task Division, but the Russians prevent this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the most negative impact of Russia’s intervention on the Syrian armed forces was to make them dependent on Russian support in multiple ways. Whether this was unintended or deliberate outcome is still a matter of debate. Syrian officers were fully aware that Syria was unable to sustain even its shaky security apparatus without external support and that Russia was hard to replace in that role, and the Iranians agreed, too. The most optimistic Syrian officers argued that Syria could resist only for a short period and would need Russia to last longer. Even in the summer of 2024, the Syrian MoD needed the Russian advisors to “keep the situation stable there”. A Syrian intelligence officer noted that despite efforts to bring the 8th Brigade under Damascus’ control, Russian advisers were still needed in 2024 to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another perverse effect of Russian efforts to reform the Syrian armed forces in a context of their deep dysfunctionality is the introduction of a “leading from behind” approach, intended to reduce the high level of casualties among officers. This, when combined with the growing practice of officers getting civilian jobs or running businesses alongside their military occupation, played out badly in 2024, when many tactical units were left without leadership by absentee commanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deteriorating-relations&quot;&gt;Deteriorating relations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-criticism-of-the-syrian-armed-forces&quot;&gt;Russian criticism of the Syrian armed forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, efforts to reform the Syrian army have been acknowledged by the Russians to have mostly failed. The Russians blamed the Syrian regime. Tensions escalated to the point that Putin in various occasions sent representatives such as his minister of defense, army chief of staff and foreign minister to meet Assad and advocate changes in the Syrian military. Within the Russian MoD there was a 2024 discussion about bailing out of all training and advising support for Syrian forces and bringing in private military companies instead. Other solutions that some Russian diplomats offered betray the total lack of faith in the ability of the regime to fix its own armed forces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;eradicate corruption by replacing the high-ranking generals and commanders who support some of the individuals involved in it;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;seize control of the main departments within the ministry of defence, particularly the logistics division;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;replace most of the army officers and high-ranking commanders with new officers trained in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;syrian-unhappiness-with-the-russians&quot;&gt;Syrian unhappiness with the Russians&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the Russians agreed in principle with Türkiye, Saudi Arabia and the UAE to a transition process in which Bashar al Assad would have to leave power and a coalition government would take over, including most opposition groups. Former Vice-President Farouk al Sharaa was Russia’s favorite to succeed Assad as president because he is a Sunni, as well as for his good relations with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, various European countries and Russia. Al Assad, who had once had al Sharaa detained, was clearly unhappy about the proposed transition, a matter in which he was supported by the Iranians. By mid-2017, therefore, Syrian-Russian relations were already tense, among other reasons. Assad was, however, already then worried that the Russians might bail out of Syria if he completely rejected their pressure for a political settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major grudge was that after 2021 the Russians were making direct contact with all army units, alleging that the regime’s corruption left them with no choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…earlier relations with the Russians were mostly going through the Syrian Foreign Ministry, but now the Russians have changed that and have direct relations and links with security forces, corps, and armed groups. Therefore, they are not keeping strong relations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for each further step and action. Even President Bashar al Assad himself had a conversation with the minister of foreign affairs of Russia so that [the Russians] would manage all their policies with all security and armed units through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but it was not enough and [the Russians] still have their different interlocutors in each agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The army was “not happy to be controlled by Russia and Iran”, concluded the official. He also noted how the Russians were keen to see militias incorporated in the army only when the beneficiaries were the corps they were sponsoring and de facto controlling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian-sponsored militias were also accused of serving little purpose, compared to Iran-sponsored ones, which were more aggressive and proactive. The Russians seemed to be using the Syrian militias for their own purposes. According to the account provided by Syrian officials, the regime was irked by Wagner’s efforts to assert control over the militias and Syrian private security or military companies, such as ISIS Hunters. The Syrian government ended up with no control over ISIS Hunters, which reported only to Wagner Group and the Russian armed forces. Indeed, ISIS Hunters ran into multiple problems with the Syrian armed forces, occasionally even turning their weapons against them, with significant loss of life at two main battles near the Shaer gas field in 2016 and Jazal oil field in 2017, both in Homs. The Assad regime repeatedly tried to take control of ISIS Hunters: “they arranged meetings with Syrian intelligence services, asked the defense minister for help and even requested Wagner Group and the Russian ambassador, but there was no result”. The Assad regime also objected to Redut taking over Wagner’s role in 2023 and to the continuing existence of the militias Wagner had formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syrian disillusionment with the Russians grew gradually. A senior Baathist figure noted at the end of 2023 that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are no love story and emotions in the political relationships between countries; there are interests and only interests. Russia sent its aircrafts, warships, troops and military advisors to Syria to support the government of President Bashar al Assad not because Russian President Vladimir Putin loves Syria and President Bashar. […] I am sure that Russia had costs, but it returned every single dollar it paid by taking big investments in Syria. […] Russia has won in Syria, not lost, and this reinforces the Syrian officials’ and people’s rage about Russian policies and strategies. […] I and big numbers of Syrians believe that Russia wants to keep the Syrian government, army and economy weak [to make it] depend completely on Russian and Iranian support and help. […] The instability and insecurity of Syria serve the Russians’ interest more than a strong, central-controlled Syrian government with a strong army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not an isolated view. At one point, President Assad sent a formal ultimatum to prevent the Russians from taking over some economic projects. A similar tone is found in an interview with an army officer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you look at all the wars in the world, no one supported his allies without any expectation. In the same way, when the Russians started to support President Bashar al Assad, they wanted something in return; therefore, even if President Assad tries to make any changes, the Russians […] want to take everything in their hands, but President Assad will not let it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s efforts to reach and maintain an understanding with Turkish President Erdogan were also resented in Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Putin and his government want to keep war-related good ties with Türkiye and signed agreements and truces with Türkiye to maintain the situation on the Idlib and Aleppo fronts. Putin and his ministers met with Erdogan and his ministers for long hours and express their support to each other. […] Russia and Türkiye have a secret understanding and accords to keep the front lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syrian-Russian tensions increased in 2017-18 as the threat posed by opposition groups was receding. The presence of so many former oppositionists in Dara’a, still armed, was (rightly) seen as a major liability by regime officials. The Russia-sponsored peace deals in southern Syria were another bête noire of the Assad regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russia, due to big pressure from Israel, engaged in reconciliation deals in southern Syria to guarantee stability and security in the region for Israel’s interests, not for the Syrian government’s goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians rejected the Syrian regime’s plans (endorsed by the Iranians) to disarm the southern opposition groups and move the hardliners to the Idlib area, as done elsewhere. Instead, Russia insisted to keep the former rebels in the south armed, with the aim of incorporating them into the armed forces. This would have given Russia a strong constituency within the Syrian armed forces and established a buffer between Israel and the Iranians. One of the results was that some 20,000-25,000 former rebels, “who can [take] control [of] the province of Dara’a and Quenitra in a few hours,” remained in the south, creating a liability for the Assad regime. Indeed, these forces turned against Assad in December 2024 and seized the south in a matter of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way the Russians retained control over the portions of the Syrian air force that they had modernized was also resented. Along the same lines, they agreed to boost the capabilities of the air force, training crews and providing refurbished planes “by the end of 2024”, such as helicopters and Su-24s and Su-25s. Some upgrades were made, but “Russia updated and fixed around 20 jet fighters but kept them under its command, and they are only used under Russian orders” The Russians authorized their use only in support of units they cherished, such as 30th Republican Guard Division and 25th Division. The fact that they insisted on picking Syrian pilot trainees for the Russian Air Force Academy individually, bypassing the Syrian authorities, was also seen as scandalous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the warplanes and helicopters available to the Syrian command were old models and lacked spare parts because Russia “did not reply to the Syrian Air Force Command, which keeps asking Russia to update Syrian airplanes”. The Syrians sought spare parts and technical support from Iran and China, but that hardly proved an adequate solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Russians had committed to strengthening and upgrading Syria’s air defense on the basis of the 1980 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Syria and the Soviet Union and the 2015 agreement on Russian intervention, but after some early investment the efforts basically came to a halt. When Israeli air strikes intensified in 2024, in the wake of the Gaza crisis, this became a major issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-impact-of-the-gaza-crisis&quot;&gt;The impact of the Gaza crisis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Syrian-Russian relations were already deteriorating in 2017-18, long before the full-scale war in Ukraine and the Gaza crisis. After 2020, the sense of abandonment within the ranks of the Assad regime became more palpable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Syrian full scale war and military operations have been stopped since early 2020, and up to now no country in the world, including Russia and China, has given the Syrian government money and funds to rebuild the electricity stations and plants, damaged and demolished government hospitals and buildings and even schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gaza crisis that started in October 2023 further compounded the crisis in Syrian-Russian relations. The fear of being dragged into a war with Israel, combined with the awareness of being completely unable to take on the Israelis, appears to have contributed to dampening morale. According to a Syrian intelligence officer, “the Syrian armed forces believe that Iran and Israel would drag Syria into a conflict in the future; they both would use Syria as a conflict field”. “We are scared of war; we are not going to trust Iranians in the south at all; we cannot take that risk”, commented a Syrian officer in December 2023. The Assad regime was very clear about the prospect that a growing presence of Iran and its allies in Syria would draw the Israelis into the conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We as Syrians do not want to see others fight in our country for their own sake; we do not want to see Syria in long-term war; we do not want to see Israelis target our territory just because of an Iranian presence in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Assad regime responded with a flurry of diplomatic activity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the war in Gaza, the concern was rising day by day, and even our defense minister has been talking since then with the Iranian defense minister and the leader of the Sepah-e Pasdaran regarding the situation. And besides that, President Assad was talking over the situation and possible war between Iran and Israel with President Raisi and with President Pezeshkian. […] He was arranging meetings with officers of the Syrian army, Russian advisors, and Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in this context that Russia’s unwillingness to extend the protection of its air defenses to Syrian assets further demoralized the Syrians, as regular Israeli air strikes were taking place during 2024. A journalist noted that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Israeli air strikes on the Syrian governmental and Iranian targets create a big debate among all Syrian officers, officials and pro-Assad people. I met with different Syrians, and all were very enraged with the Russian weakness in countering and facing the Israeli air strikes and missiles. […] [This] pushes many pro-Assad Syrians to distrust Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Baathist official commented that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Syrian officials asked the Russians why they did not counter the Israeli attacks […]. The Russians replied that their presence in Syria is to counter only Syrian terrorist groups, not to face Israeli attacks and air strikes. These Russian statements […] led many Syrians to consider Russia as a weak ally…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A member of parliament from Dara’a noted with anger that while the Russians would not or could not stop Israeli air strikes, the Americans were “support[ing] for the Kurdish separate militias (SDF) with everything”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-criticism-of-the-assad-regime-intensifies&quot;&gt;Russian criticism of the Assad regime intensifies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, early Russian struggles in Syria were ascribed to Iranian disruption. Iran continued being seen as a disruptive force until the very end of the Assad regime. A Russian diplomat described Iran’s diverging views as a major obstacle toward reorganizing the Syrian government. However, the Russians became increasingly critical of the Assad regime itself. A Russian diplomat identified two reasons for the worsening relations with Syria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the changing relationship with President Assad and his family, due to their corruption and exclusiveness, as well as their attempts to reduce Russian influence in the armed forces;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Syria’s ambition to develop closer relations with Arab powers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irritation at President Assad’s poor “management” led to the Russians trying to bypass him and his government as much as possible and establish direct links with military units, essentially trying to acquire control. Tensions over the Assad regime’s efforts to seize control of some units and militias that were trained and funded by the Russians eventually pushed the Russians to threaten the suspension of all support. The problems started in early 2022, but worsened over time. The climax came when Suhail al Hasan was replaced at the top of 25th Brigade in late 2023, which coincided with another deep cut in Russian support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia’s declining commitment and influence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2024, it had become clear to all inside the Syrian regime and its closest allies too that Russia would be unable or unwilling to commit the same resources to Syria as in the past. As a result, Russian influence was clearly in marked decline. The Russians themselves acknowledged this trend. Russian patrols were greatly reduced in number. Russia had been providing both direct financial support to the Syrian regime, and logistical support for its armed forces. Financial support continued, but despite remaining at the rather high level of $3 billion in total in 2022-23, it had fallen. At the peak of the war, in 2016-17, Russia was spending around $2.5 billion a year to support the Syrian regime. As early as 2023 the Russians cut funding to units that were deemed disloyal to them. By 2024, financial support was 70% off the peak figures. The value of logistical support is not known, but sources say that although it suffered less, it still declined 20%. Close air support sorties were reduced, with the best pilots being sent to fly over Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the presence of Russian advisers had become much rarer by 2024, and they largely focused on advising senior officials, such as Assad, heads of intelligence and high-ranking generals (occasionally). In other words, by 2024 the Russians were no longer taking part in operations. The roughly 80 Russian advisers present in October 2024 were spread between ministries such as defense, foreign affairs and economics, as well as the presidency. The periods of deployment were also shortened. At the peak of Russian engagement in 2017, there were 671 advisors in Syria. Sources differ somewhat about the exact distribution of the advisers in 2024, but there seem to have been some with the Liwa al Quds militia, some with the 25th Division, 19 with the Syrian air force, 12 with military intelligence, 12 with air defense and two with some army brigades. Although the Syrians appear to retain a positive impression of Russian advisers, even compared to Iranian ones, and despite the shared interest with the Syrians in keeping the country out of the Gaza crisis, together with supporting secularism (which appealed especially to Christians), inevitably the influence of Russian advisers declined with their numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that Russian influence was nonexistent by late 2024, as Russians still worked closely with the 14th Special Forces Division, 25th Division, 4th Corps, Air Force Command, Chief of Staff and Ministry of Defense, with which they coordinated military operations and air strikes. In the summer of 2024, the Russians promised to stop further withdrawals and reductions except in the event of an emergency nearer home. Still, the downward trend was unmistakable. In January 2024, a Syrian general noted in amazement that “Two years ago, the Russians were talking about getting the Iranians out of Syria and controlling the country alone…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, some of the Russians’ Syrian interlocutors were thinking that the Russians still present were no longer keen to maintain close relations with the Syrian government, the members of Syrian parliament and the Syrian security council, or sought to influence them. Russian behavior hinted to their old counterparts that they had given up. This was evident in the 8th Brigade:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Three years ago, Russia’s officers were holding daily meetings with local leaders and government officials to coordinate Russian military activities and solving the locals’ problems with the governmental security and military departments. Now, the Russian officers have no plans and strategies except how to make money and get gifts and bribes to send to their families in Russia. The Russian officers and soldiers are selling their foodstuff and oil products, and even their trucks’ engine oil, to make cash dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranians were clearly benefiting from the Russian drawdown, but contrary to what had been the case before 2022, when Moscow had been keen to compete with Tehran for influence, the Russians did not seem bothered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Russian military policemen and officers are touring in Dara’a Province [where they were not supposed to be] and they see Iran’s militiamen, but they do nothing and avoid making problems with them. Two years ago, Iran’s militiamen were afraid of making problems with the Russians and did not appear in areas where the Russians were working and patrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diplomatic divergence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Syrians knew they were not in a position to quarrel with Russia over its declining commitment. However, they did try to diversify their sources of external support, even if they kept seeking Russian support as well. The Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs tried first of all to mitigate the risks by seeking to lower its international profile. It issued a letter to its officials, saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Currently, we will need to establish a cordial relationship with neighboring countries; we should try to keep good relations with the Turks and the Saudis; and we will need to keep close relations with the opposition in order to keep the situation stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some Syrian officials argued that Syria should raise taxes and increase oil and gas exports, Damascus also appealed for financial support to Iran, in the end obtaining little, and to China, achieving nothing. Assad then turned to the Gulf states, as well as other Arab capitals, “trying to convince the strong countries in the region to support the Syrian government politically and militarily”. In fact, the outreach to some Arab countries was bearing some fruit for Damascus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Syrian officials met with the UAE a while ago, they promised to support the Syrian government and provide funding for the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE also supported Syrian effort to reconnect diplomatically throughout the region and offered funding for reconstruction. A Syrian officer noted that Arab support would be conditional on getting the Iranians out of Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the meeting of our minister of foreign affairs with the UAE, the core request of the UAE officials was to cut off all relations with the Iranians in order for the UAE to be able to provide any kind of support for the Syrian government. In the same way, the Saudis are asking for the same thing, so if the situation gets worse in Syria once again, that will force us to do whatever we need to do for keeping peace and stability in Syria. […] Of course, the Arab countries are not happy about the Iranian presence in Syria; the Saudis, Kuwait, the UAE and even Egypt asked clearly that Syria should cut and end its relations with the Iranians. In return, they promised that they would bring pace and stability to Syria, and they even promised that they would make Syrian relations with the West and the Americans normal [again].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Syrian efforts exacerbated the worsening relationship with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Syrian army officer confirmed that “The Russians were not happy with President Assad because of his visits to some countries in the Middle East”. A senior Baathist also stated his belief that “Russia knows that President Bashar al Assad and his regime want to establish good ties with the West, America and Gulf States as before the 2011 war”. Although both the Syrians and the Russians believed that the Iranians would block any UAE approaches to Syria, Russia likely saw Assad’s efforts as a sign of long-term disloyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-of-the-reduced-russian-commitment-on-the-syrian-regimes-collapse&quot;&gt;The impact of the reduced Russian commitment on the Syrian regime’s collapse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of Russia’s reduced commitment on the Syrian regime and especially its armed forces was very significant, and not only because salaries were delayed or not paid at all. One IRGC colonel acknowledged that “There has been a huge impact on the Syrian armed forces since the Russians reduced their presence in Syria. The morale of the Syrian armed forces is not the same as it was before”. Russian influence over the militias declined, as well, and they turned elsewhere for support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reduction in Russian support translated into salaries failing to keep pace with Syria’s very high inflation, serving to demoralize and encourage corrupt practices. A particularly damaging form of corruption was the practice of officers’ selling semipermanent leave to their subordinates. To save money (and probably for other reasons as well), the Syrian MoD moved many active soldiers to the reserve, demobilized many veterans, and discharged existing reservists. Many units were moved back to their barracks, which entailed more interaction with civilian life. It became easier for officers to do business, at the cost of attention to their duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 2024, it became common to hear from both Syrian and Russian sources that the Syrian armed forces would be unable to cope with an external war, or even with an internal crisis. An army officer noted that at the end of 2023 the Syrian government remained very weak in the south. Indeed, the 8th Brigade quickly joined the opposition in December 2024, becoming a leading actor in the collapse of regime control in the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I personally heard from different governmental officers and officials, and they confirmed that they are not happy at all with the Russian role in Syria in general and in Dara’a Province in particular. The Syrian government asked the Russian officers to take serious steps to empower the governmental department, security and police stations in different towns and villages in Dara’a. The key problem was that […] around 70 to 80% of Dara’a towns and villages have ex-fighters present, although the government has police and security stations in them, the real power and influence is with ex-fighters’ groups, which are sponsored and led by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purges intended to roll back Russian influence in the armed forces suddenly appeared to backfire when the 25th Division, possibly the most effective unit in the entire army, failed to hold territory in the north in late November. Its new commander, Salah Abdullah, was replaced by his predecessor and Russian loyalist Suhail al Hasan on December 2, but by then it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major consequence of corruption and declining financial support from Russia was manpower problems. A Syrian officer put the number of “active fighters” in the Syrian Arab Army at 100,000 in August 2024. Another source put its total strength at 150,000 in April 2024. These figures thus show its strength as almost equal to that recorded in July 2017, despite the incorporation of a number of militias into the army. The incorporation of the militias had contributed to the shrinking of the overall militia size from 147,000 to 55,000 over the same time span. Moreover, the remaining militias were no longer active. The NDF (National Defense Forces) had by then been demobilized and given a reserve role, with 39,000 men. Another 16,000 men were in the LDF (Local Defense Forces), at an even lower level of preparedness. The combined number of militias was down compared to 2021. In addition, in mid-2024 there were some 13,000 foreign militiamen, including 7,000 from Hizbollah, 3,000 from Fatimiyun, 1,000 from Zaynabyun and 2,000 Iraqis and Yemenis. During 2024, the IRGC and Hizbollah agreed on the latter pulling its forces out of Syria, with the Iranians mobilizing reserves from Iraqi, Afghan, Pakistani and other foreign militias. The IRGC was also planning to increase the number of militiamen, despite Syrian opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia rescued the Syrian regime in 2015-16, but its ambitious plan to save the Syrian regime and rebuild a strong state in Syria got bogged down in the contradictions of that very regime. The Russians started losing faith in Assad and his government, but they were stuck in Syria by then. From 2017 onward, their efforts to strengthen the regime clashed with the interests of the Assad clique and ended up backfiring. As the Russians sponsored their choice of more capable commanding officers, Assad’s purges reserved their reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022, Russia did reduce its commitments in Syria, pulling out forces and reducing funding. However, the trend of reducing support for the Assad regime had started earlier – no later than 2020, perhaps even earlier. Russia had also grown irritated at Assad’s rejection of its efforts to mediate a stable settlement. Assad, for his part, started worrying about what the Russians might be up to, after they had lobbied for his replacement at the head of the Syrian state. From there onward, relations between the two regimes deteriorated steadily. The Russians increasingly sought to bypass Assad and his clan to build their own network of loyalists within the Syrian armed forces. Assad tried to undermine their efforts, against which the Russians eventually retaliated by increasingly restricting support to units deemed to be loyal to them. Assad probably suspected the Russians were still plotting to replace him some day with someone more acceptable to opposition groups, the more so as the Russians had turned into de facto protectors of a number of opposition groups in the south. In late 2023-early 2024, a Syrian crackdown on Russian cronies within the security forces proved the turning point as far as Russian support to the Syrian regime was concerned, not the start of the Ukraine war in February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians also intensified their contacts with the Turks to reach a settlement, which seemed destined to take place over Assad’s head. Unsurprisingly, Assad sought to sabotage these efforts as well. Russia’s behavior undoubtedly resulted in a weakened regime in Syria, in part because some of the reforms were ill-conceived and in part because the regime rejected Russia’s efforts and sought to actively undermine them. It remains unclear whether the Russians expected their financial pressure could threaten the regime’s very existence. What is clear is that not just Syrians, but Russians too were aware of the regime’s growing weakness in 2024. Probably, the Russians wanted to gain leverage in their negotiations with Assad by making him and the regime feel that ignoring Russian demands has consequences. The Russians likely calculated that no foreign government would in the end step in to replace the Russian cash that was not accruing to Damascus anymore. In that calculation they proved right, but the regime, however worried it was, did not budge on key Russian demands – quite the contrary, as the purges of pro-Russian elements in the armed forces show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the collapse of the Assad regime was certainly a major image hit for Russia, in the long run what will matter is its ability to maintain military bases in Syria. There is not enough evidence to discuss the hypothesis that the collapse of December 2024 was in fact the culmination of Russian-Turkish talks. Russia might not be particularly interested in being “influential” in Syria per se, but it is certainly keen on retaining its bases there. If it could do that, likely thanks to Turkish intercession, it could claim a not-so-negative outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should Russia lose its bases, the reasons for this failure would still require assessment. Were Russian geopolitical and strategic assets dragged into the abyss because of an ill-conceived gamble to coerce the Syrian regime into reforming (an interpretation that Assad’s supporters would favor)? Or was the regime doomed anyway, and the Russians just decided to risk accelerating the collapse in a last-ditch effort to reform it (an interpretation that Russian officials would favor)? Or, perhaps, was the regime likely going to survive, but without serving Russia’s foreign policy and geostrategic aims while nevertheless draining billions of dollars from the Russian state coffers every year? Overall, the third hypothesis seems to be the most solid, even though it needs further investigation. Before the Russians started cutting their funding, it was not apparent that the Assad regime, though increasingly dysfunctional, was doomed. As important as the bases were for Russia, one might speculate that persistent recent Russian efforts to establish footholds in Libya and Sudan might have been driven by growing unease about the fate and/or safety of Tartus and Khmeimim, or even about the disproportionate overall cost of maintaining them (support for the regime plus the cost of Russian deployment). Assad’s refusal to seriously negotiate a political and geopolitical settlement was a major blow to Russia’s ambition as a regional power, an ambition that rested first and foremost on its role as a mediator between actors as different as Türkiye, Iran, Israel and the Arab states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has had an immense human cost, producing a level of physical destruction, human suffering, and displacement not seen in Europe since World War II. Since the war began, a large share of Ukraine’s workforce has emigrated or relocated within the country, enlisted in the military, or tragically become a casualty of the violence. In addition, unpredictable changes to the conscription and mobilization of men have significantly compressed the labor supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This difficult workforce situation affects business operations across Ukraine and threatens the country’s future reconstruction and growth prospects. According to an October 2024 survey by Ukraine’s Institute for Economic Research and Policy Consulting, labor shortages are the private sector’s top concern, with more than 60 percent of the companies consulted finding it difficult to hire qualified workers. At the same time, recent estimates show that the current unemployment rate in Ukraine stood at 12.7 percent in late 2024, meaning unemployment coexists with labor shortages that reflect pervasive skills mismatches across regions and sectors of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the war, Ukraine was experiencing a challenging demographic scenario characterized by low birth rates, premature mortality among men, and emigration of young Ukrainians looking for better economic opportunities abroad. As a result of these negative trends, Ukraine will have a large deficit of workers in the future. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates the country will need an additional 8.6 million workers by 2032 (compared to 2022). The government of Ukraine, working with the international community and relevant stakeholders, will have to develop and implement a comprehensive human capital strategy to address current and future workforce needs. This will require a combination of short-term and long-term actions that seek to expand the country’s talent pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukraines-demographic-and-workforce-challenges&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s Demographic and Workforce Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s current workforce challenges are part of a larger demographic problem. The country’s birth rate is now the lowest in Europe: below 1 child per woman, compared to Eastern Europe’s average birthrate of approximately 1.3–1.8 children per woman. Moreover, high rates of premature deaths—especially among men—due to alcoholism, accidents, and lifestyle choices have contributed to the decline in population. Other ongoing trends such as emigration, overall poor health, and rapid aging have complicated the demographic landscape of the country (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IfoiMcS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Ukraine’s Annual Population Growth, 2015–2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;amp;country=UKR&quot;&gt;“World Development Indicators: Ukraine,” World Bank Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last Ukrainian census, conducted in 2001, recorded a population of 48.5 million. Due to the war, many Ukrainians have emigrated abroad, an estimated 20,000 Ukrainian children have been forcibly deported to Russia, and thousands more are living under Russian occupation. Sadly, many Ukrainians have also perished. As of December 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that 43,000 Ukrainian troops have been killed. In addition, approximately 12,000 civilians have died and thousands of Ukrainians have been injured or disabled. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as of November 2024 there are around 4 million internally displaced people (IDPs) in Ukraine, 6.8 million refugees registered in other countries, and approximately 14.6 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. As a result of these trends, Ukraine’s population has fallen to an estimated 35.8 million as of July 2024—or 31.1 million if considering only the areas where the government of Ukraine exercises full authority. If this situation is not addressed, the population of Ukraine could further shrink to 28.9 million by 2041 and to 25.2 million by 2051, according to Ukraine’s National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Population declines and labor force contraction are producing a severe shock to Ukraine’s economy, with negative effects to be felt for years to come. Empirical studies indicate that time out of work can not only lead to the depreciation of skills, but also impacts national productivity and wages. A protracted conflict will have even more serious implications for educational attainment, which will have its own negative impacts on Ukraine’s future human capital. Due to wartime, schooling has been disrupted and children have therefore experienced learning losses. All in all, initial research by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development suggests the war in Ukraine will reduce the total factor of national productivity by 7 percent by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, poor mental health affects individuals and has ripple effects on society and the economy. Even before the latest war, an estimated 30 percent of the Ukrainian population had a mental health condition at some point in their lives. Within the first year of Russia’s invasion, an estimated 26 percent of Ukrainians met diagnostic requirements for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) alone. Although the added impact of mental health conditions and disabilities is difficult to quantify, it does lead to job absenteeism and loss of productivity. There is consensus that investments in mental health far outweigh the socioeconomic costs of leaving individuals untreated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-for-women-and-veterans&quot;&gt;Challenges for Women and Veterans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the war, the Ukrainian labor market faced inefficiencies and inequities and was not reaching its full potential. In 2020, there were more than 10 million working-age Ukrainians (between 15 and 70 years) outside the labor force. Some of them were pensioners and students, but working-age women were also not actively participating in the labor market. While the labor force participation rate in Ukraine was 67 percent in 2021, the average for Central Europe and the Baltic States was approximately 73 percent (Figure 2). As discussed above, the war caused more people to exit the workforce, shrinking it by over 25 percent in 2023 compared to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kfNjMXA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this context, there are unique challenges that women and veterans are facing in the economy. Before Russia’s invasion, there was a prominent gender gap of 15 percentage points in workforce participation and a wage gap of 18.6 percent. The war has compounded the preexisting structural disparities in the Ukrainian economy, with the wage gap now more than 30 percent. Moreover, of the 5.4 million IDPs as of January 2023, 55 percent were women and girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war has also altered Ukrainian women’s role in society and the economy. They are expected to care not only for their children, but also for the elderly and other family members with reduced mobility. Outside of household obligations, women are also increasingly heading family businesses. According to recent estimates, more than half of the new businesses launched during the war are led by women. However, they are often sole proprietors, while bigger companies are predominately run by men. According to a study by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Investment and Trade Facilitation Center, women entrepreneurs are most active in sectors such as services, trade, education, and creative industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veterans are also an important demographic group for revitalizing the nation’s economy. Once the war ends and the government launches the demobilization process, veterans are expected to number more than 5 million, most of them of working age. Successfully reintegrating veterans into the economy will be an important channel through which Ukraine can address its human capital issue. Veterans bring both hard skills (for instance in mechanics, operating machinery, and telecommunications) and soft skills (such as resilience, teamwork, leadership, adaptability, and creativity) from their battlefield experience that can be applied to many sectors and occupations. Estimates from Ukraine’s Ministry for Veterans Affairs indicate that any money invested in the rehabilitation of veterans will see a sixfold return on investment for the economy. Moreover, veterans will be integral to building social cohesion and reconstructing Ukraine. As such, they are advocating for fair, transparent, and efficient programs to better support their reintegration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2021, Ukrainians’ trust in the armed forces has been at an all-time high, surging to 96 percent in September 2022. Despite the value placed on veterans and the government programs aimed at assisting them, this group still faces many reintegration challenges. According to a recent poll, among the main challenges Ukrainians believe veterans will face when integrating back to civil life include “psychoemotional instability, issues with physical health, difficulties in accessing medical assistance, the absence of inclusive spaces and adapted workplaces for individuals with disabilities, as well as challenges related to the processing of social benefits.” Of the roughly 300,000 Ukrainians who have been severely injured and disabled due to the war, the majority are veterans. Unfortunately, many spaces such as apartment buildings, private sector workspaces, educational institutions, and government facilities are not designed to be accessible—lacking, for instance, ramps or elevators. This acts as a significant barrier to both the employment and daily activities of disabled Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to government estimates, unemployment among veterans is currently double that of the civilian population, at more than 30 percent. Organizations working with veterans point out that employers are reluctant to hire them since there is a stereotypical view that all veterans have mental health problems and are affected by PTSD. In addition, people in the workplace often do not know how to interact with veterans and lack tactful communication skills. Very few companies have good onboarding processes, especially when it comes to employing veterans. At the same time, the average pay in the armed forces is usually higher compared to other sectors. Many veterans thus prefer to start their own businesses since they can command a higher income and do not have to interact as much with coworkers who might have certain biases toward them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has a State Employment Service that helps with job matching and training. The agency has programs for women, IDPs, veterans, and other categories of unemployed workers to help them find jobs and provides micro-grants for entrepreneurs. The Ministry for Veterans Affairs also offers training, vouchers, job matching, and opportunities for veterans to help them start businesses. However, these agencies could serve these demographic groups more effectively. For example, there is a lack of interagency effort to advertise programs for veterans, especially in smaller towns and rural areas. In addition, while younger veterans can access digital platforms that promote jobs and support programs, older ones may have more difficulty with technology and getting this information. As a result, surveys find that many Ukrainians—especially those living in western regions and relatives of army members—feel the state is not fulfilling its obligations to veterans. This negative sentiment has been steadily rising; in August 2022, 69 percent believed that “the state fulfills its obligations to veterans,” but only 25 percent did by March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are regulatory bottlenecks that prevent women, people with disabilities, and veterans from being more active in the workforce. The Labor Law of Ukraine, adopted during the Soviet period, is more than 50 years old. While some parts of the code have been updated, it remains largely unchanged and still contains archaic, unfair, and rigid labor regulations. For example, overtime is not allowed, there are few provisions for remote or gig work, and working women with children under three are still barred from traveling for business. Legislation and lack thereof also presents an obstacle for disabled people—such as the lack of anti-discrimination policies and requirements that they obtain employment permits that are valid only for one sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These obstacles are even more numerous for the many disabled veterans. Currently, there is a provision that if the Central Military Medical Board considers someone physically or mentally unfit to serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they are likewise barred from joining the National Police Service in any capacity. Easing some of these requirements, depending on the degree of disability, would provide workers and employers more flexibility and improve the functioning of Ukraine’s labor market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-initiatives-and-potential-solutions&quot;&gt;Current Initiatives and Potential Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, Ukraine lacked a vision for comprehensive demographic development, but the government has now started taking steps to address these issues, particularly as they apply to the workforce. Under the EU Ukraine Facility, it has prepared the Ukraine Plan outlining four major areas of focused development: education and skills, healthcare access and rehabilitation services, reintegration of workers into the labor market, and increasing the economic and social capacity of the population. This plan will also play an integral role in institutional overhauls viewed as imperative to successful EU accession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, on September 30, 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers released the Strategy for the Demographic Development of Ukraine until 2040. Developed by the Ministry of Social Policy with support from a variety of national and international partners, the strategy lays out six important goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create conditions for immigration and reducing Ukrainian emigration;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increase the birth rate and support growing families;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;reduce the premature mortality rates;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increase workforce participation and modernize the labor market;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;encourage IDPs to return home or relocate to areas with labor shortages; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;improve overall quality of life in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of international partners, in November 2024, the Ministry of Social Policy approved the action plan that details how to operationalize the strategy until 2040. The plan puts emphasis in six main areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supporting the growth of birth rates and families;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;reducing premature mortality;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;attracting migrants and promoting the return of Ukrainians from abroad;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;promoting active longevity;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;developing infrastructure for quality living; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increasing employment for vulnerable groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, the economic empowerment of Ukrainian women has been a major focus of the wartime government. In December 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers adopted the Strategy for the Implementation of Gender Equality in Education until 2030, to ensure equal rights and opportunities for women and men in education. In September 2023, the Ukrainian government also enacted the National Strategy for Reducing the Gender Pay Gap until 2030, which seeks to address wage disparities in the labor market and the unequal distribution of domestic responsibilities between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the request of the government of Ukraine, the ILO modeled alternative scenarios, examining labor inputs across different economic sectors. It found that Ukraine will need 8.6 million additional workers between 2022 and 2032 to achieve the country’s GDP targets. These labor market projections indicate that around 60 percent of additional employment would be in the service sector, 27.4 percent in industry, and 12.6 percent in agriculture. Around 35.4 percent of new workers would be in high-skill jobs, 47.6 percent in medium-skill jobs, and 17 percent in low-skill ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these projections, Ukraine has an opportunity to broaden its labor force and incorporate underserved groups into the economy: women, veterans, people with disabilities, older workers, and IDPs. Given the increasing role women and veterans have been playing due to the war, these groups should be part of the policymaking process and future reconstruction talks. Although the United Nations has found that women play big role in peacebuilding and reconstruction, for instance, they are often excluded from the labor market, formal peace processes, and overall decisionmaking. The EU accession process will provide Ukrainian women additional opportunities for more economic empowerment and inclusion. Ukraine also needs to address veterans’ reintegration, as well as the social frictions between Ukrainians who stayed in the country and those who decided to leave. Veterans are especially sensitive toward the issue of transparency—whether in recruitment, training, or workforce incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous opportunities to integrate Ukrainians into the labor market and stem the country’s massive brain drain. This will include both short-term and long-term efforts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;short-term-measures&quot;&gt;Short-Term Measures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design “quick” training programs to increase labor force participation.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all jobs in Ukraine require a university degree or a high level of skills. A fair amount of them demand intense physical labor, and Ukraine needs to have people who are trained and ready for these jobs. Women could be incentivized to join sectors that are traditionally male-dominated, including energy, trade, transport, construction, and information technology. In particular, there are opportunities to incorporate women, veterans, and older workers into the defense-industrial complex, renewable energy, and cybersecurity—sectors that will play an important role in strengthening Ukraine’s security. Training women for blue-collar jobs could also be beneficial. For example, one training program is targeting women to become truck drivers, of which there is currently a shortage. Similarly, women are being trained and hired to do more physically demanding jobs, such as manufacturing steel (as at ArcelorMittal’s plant) or military equipment. There are also significant immediate needs in the healthcare sector, where not all jobs require extensive medical training. Programs like Lecturio and others offer a range of online training modules that are specifically designed for healthcare workers in conflict zones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an integrated veterans’ platform linked to the municipalities.&lt;/strong&gt; Although there are programs to support veterans, they are not interconnected and not widely known among the target group. In this regard, building a unique platform tied to municipal governments (hromadas) would make it easier for veterans to search for information about support programs, access benefits, and receive career guidance showing how different occupations contribute to the economy and to the construction of a modern Ukraine. Financial literacy among veterans and their families is severely lacking, and although veterans receive various forms of financial support, it is important to provide them with guidance on spending and investing their money to make the best use of it. This would not only help them integrate into civilian life but assist them with long-term planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modernize public employment services.&lt;/strong&gt; The Kyiv School of Economics has recommended specific steps to modernize the State Employment Service (SES) to make it more valuable for jobseekers and employers. One effort would be to decentralize the agency by placing services within city administrations, which have a more accurate picture of the social challenges and the business activities within their jurisdictions. Moreover, business associations and civil society organizations that work with vulnerable groups can be better linked digitally to the employment service, for example, through Diia, a digital portal that allows citizens to access more than 100 government services. Donors such as Estonia are providing technical assistance and training to SES staff to improve the functioning of the agency and align it with EU standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reform the Labor Code to provide more hiring flexibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Although labor reform is by no means an easy task, there are certain provisions that could provide more leeway in hiring various employees. This includes allowing nighttime and remote work, for example, and eliminating special restrictions on categories of workers. To this end, a new code has been drafted and is currently being discussed in Ukrainian Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch targeted training for companies and business associations.&lt;/strong&gt; This entails developing a national program to train employers to effectively integrate and support veterans in the workforce, taking into consideration mental health and trauma-informed management. Companies and business associations could also offer courses for managers and human resources staff on how to onboard veterans and IDPs, as well as how to communicate with them in the workplace. In order not to alienate veterans, there is a need for better education and communication so that they are treated not as victims but as part of society at large.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;medium--to-long-term-measures&quot;&gt;Medium- to Long-Term Measures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a comprehensive skilling strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; To foster an experienced and adaptable workforce, the government of Ukraine will have to partner with businesses and universities in driving both skilling and upskilling efforts, utilizing quality online learning platforms to ensure broader accessibility for users across regions. One example of such a partnership is the recently launched ReSkillUA In addition, leveraging technology and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions will be critical in identifying skills gaps within the workforce, thereby enabling the development of tailored, individualized training programs so workers can meet the demands of the future. To support these initiatives, a diaspora fund that attracts remittances and foreign investment could provide part of the financing for innovative skilling projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop targeted programs for vulnerable groups.&lt;/strong&gt; To fully integrate all segments of society into the labor market, Ukraine will need more investment into assistive technologies for veterans and people with disabilities. Unfortunately, given the number of soldiers and civilians that lost limbs, the need for prosthetics is high. Ukraine could potentially become one of the major leaders in prosthetics technologies. It is equally important to provide relevant services for disabled citizens, from accessible houses to workplace accommodations. In this regard, Ukraine needs to find more creative solutions for housing, including modular construction and the repurposing of vacant offices or government buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, a “care economy” that provides childcare, elder care, and healthcare would help ease the burden on those—particularly women—who have not been able to seek work due to the need to take care of their relatives. This would also create enormous possibilities for launching small- and medium-sized enterprises and give women more opportunities to start businesses and participate in the labor force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase investment in mental health.&lt;/strong&gt; Tackling Ukraine’s human capital issue is not just about learning and skills, it will require a whole-of-person approach that addresses basic physical and mental health as well. Although Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska has made mental health a priority, making headway on this front will necessitate significant investments and reforms to the current system, which still has a strong practice of institutionalizing patients. Among the priorities are to increase outpatient facilities and make mental health interventions more community based. According to some estimates, such preliminary efforts will require doubling current mental health investment over the next five to ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modernize technical and vocational education and training (TVET).&lt;/strong&gt; As already mentioned, not all jobs will require a university degree, and not all future jobs will be in new fields such as tech and renewable energy. Although there is a recognition that technical and vocational education is needed, these professions have lower prestige in Ukraine, and workers encounter a range of stereotypes. Ukraine should reform its TVET system to better align it with the needs of employers and provide more avenues for workers to learn on the job through internships and apprenticeships. In this regard, it will be also important to educate youth in secondary schools about the different career opportunities that exist for them and promote vocational and technical education as a reputable career path.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a comprehensive immigration strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond safety, pay differentials between Ukraine and neighboring countries also prompt many people to emigrate. Although wages in Ukraine have been rising, they are still much lower than in EU countries. Developing and implementing a comprehensive immigration strategy could entice Ukrainians to come back and attract other migrant populations. Elements of the strategy could include incentivizing IDPs to relocate to certain parts of the country to address skills gaps, offering income tax incentives for qualified prospective immigrants, encouraging countries with large numbers of Ukrainian refugees to help finance the Ukrainian government (such as various European nations funding Ukrainian pensions and the United States covering the salaries of first responders), or collaborating with diaspora organizations to promote opportunities and facilitate the return of Ukrainians living abroad. Developing partnerships with foreign businesses and government agencies that could second their employees to Ukraine might also be an innovative option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important asset for Ukraine’s present and future development is its people—so the process of expanding and strengthening Ukraine’s human capital should start now, not once the war is over. In this regard, there are numerous opportunities to integrate more Ukrainians into the labor market and prevent further brain drain. This will require efforts to support demographic groups that have historically not fully participated in the labor market, including women, veterans, persons with disabilities, and older workers. Given the increasing role that women and veterans have been playing in the economy due to the war, these groups should also be part of the policymaking process and future reconstruction talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russian and Ukrainian forces are in a process of adaptation in the pursuit of advantage. Over time, this leads to new capabilities being fielded, tactics applied and lessons relevant to Ukraine and its international partners. The purpose of this report is to survey tactical developments during 2024 that characterise the fighting at time of publication and to highlight areas where military–technical assistance to Ukraine can be improved and where NATO militaries should adapt to keep pace with the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is based on fieldwork conducted in Ukraine in November 2024 and January 2025, with the authors having visited two air assault brigades, a marine brigade, a mechanised brigade, a jaeger brigade and assault units along the Donetsk and Sumy fronts. This is not an academic study but a series of field notes and should be read in parallel with other analysis. The report endeavours to outline the prevailing tactical dynamics before exploring emerging aspects of various tactical functions, including ground close combat, fires, engineering, medical support, logistics and air defence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a side does not achieve victory within the opening phases of a conflict, protracted warfare necessitates a continuous process of adaptation and counter-adaptation between the parties. The Russo–Ukrainian War has been consistent with this trend, such that the fighting in the first, second and third years of the war saw substantial changes in the composition of forces, equipment, tactics and relative competitive advantages of the combatants. The first year of the war was characterised by comparatively small groupings of well-equipped forces resulting in a mobile conflict. The second year saw the consolidation of areas of control and deliberate attempts to breach the line of contact, first by Russia and then by Ukraine. The third year was highly attritional, with the focus of both parties being the infliction of maximum damage on one another, rather than breakthrough. The available technology with which the war has been waged has also evolved over this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of this paper have worked in Ukraine throughout the conflict, and documented the character of the fighting at intervals, noting tactical developments and their operational implications for Ukraine, for support provided by Ukraine’s international partners, and for training and equipment programmes among NATO forces. This report builds on this work, providing an overview of tactical developments as they stand in February 2025 as the war enters its fourth year. The purpose of this paper is to describe the systems of fighting employed by Russian and Ukrainian forces and to identify where changes in how the forces fight reflect peculiarities of the current situation and where they suggest significant changes that will endure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an academic study. This paper constitutes research notes from fieldwork conducted in November 2024 and January 2025. As this work was written in Ukraine and under conditions consistent with operational security, it does not engage with wider commentaries on the current character of the war. That does not suggest any inadequacy in other studies, and the conclusions and observations in this paper should be read in parallel with similar work carried out by a range of esteemed colleagues. Please also note that this paper provides a discussion of tactics and not an assessment as to the likely outcome of engagements by sector. It does not set out to make predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The observations contained in this report are based on interviews by the authors with staff and personnel from air assault brigades, a marine brigade, a jaeger brigade, a mechanised brigade, an artillery brigade and assault units holding key sectors on the Donetsk and Sumy fronts. The authors also spoke to air defence troops and observed Ukrainian mobile air defence groups, as well as being briefed by personnel of the Donetsk and Sumy Operational Commands, the Joint Strategic–Operational Command, officers of the Ukrainian General Staff, representatives of the Ukrainian Special Services and members of Stavka. Finally, the authors compared these observations with officers responsible for the provision of military technical assistance from Ukraine’s international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is focused on tactical dynamics. The body of the report is therefore broken down into tactical functions including ground close combat, fires, engineering, reconnaissance, logistics and resupply, medical support and air defence. Some tactical functions such as aviation operations are not covered because these were not observed by the authors during the period of study. This does not mean that other tactical functions lack importance. However, developments in these areas must be understood within a wider operational context and so the paper begins with a description of the operational situation extant at the time of writing. The paper then concludes with two sections of deductions, the first relating to implications for military technical assistance to Ukraine and the second relevant for NATO forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, a wider political context unfolding, with President Donald Trump endeavouring to bring about a cessation of hostilities through economic coercion and diplomatic entreaties with Moscow. This falls beyond the scope of this paper, which is confined to military dynamics and therefore the assumption that fighting continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-context&quot;&gt;Operational Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic objective of the Russian Federation remains the political subjugation of Ukraine by forcing Kyiv to capitulate through military force. In pursuit of this objective, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) are currently pursuing the destruction of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) through a firepower-intensive attritional fight over critical terrain in Donetsk Oblast as their main effort. Simultaneously Ukraine is holding Russian territory in Kursk Oblast, endeavouring to fix Russian forces away from Kharkiv and maintain leverage in the event of negotiations. The AFRF are endeavouring to evict the AFU from Russian territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The piecemeal capture of territory at great cost and the lack of broader or rapid movement on the frontline can give the appearance of a lack of any decisive effect. However, Russia’s ground campaign has maintained constant attritional pressure on Ukraine throughout the war, with lost personnel requiring replacement, alongside materiel and munitions which must be regenerated or replaced. As Russia’s mobilisation of its industry and population got underway, it has been able to stretch the AFU across an extended frontline, and at the time of writing, Russia has a viable but not assured pathway to achieving its main effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian Operational Group of Forces attacking Ukraine currently consists of approximately 580,000 troops. Approximately 70,000 of these are fighting in Kursk Oblast, augmented by approximately 10,000 North Korean soldiers, with more DPRK units likely to arrive in before May 2025. A further 80,000 troops are currently operating on the Kharkiv axis, endeavouring to expand a bridgehead over the Oskil River. The largest grouping of Russian forces is in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, comprising some 230,000 troops, advancing on a broad front with the immediate aim of isolating and then reducing Pokrovsk and attacking Konstyantynivka and Kramatorsk over the course of 2025. To the south, Russian forces have seized Velyka Novosilka and are likely to continue to slowly advance towards the border of Dnipro Oblast, bypassing the Ukrainian southern defence line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should the Ukrainian salient in Kursk be withdrawn, it is likely that the AFRF will divert capacity to expand its efforts to threaten Kharkiv Oblast. The AFRF also maintain a grouping of forces in Southern Ukraine of approximately 140,000 troops. At present, this group of forces is holding the line of contact on the southern front, with most of its efforts focused on garrisoning Crimea and fixing Ukrainian forces in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia through strikes and a latent threat against Ukrainian shipping in Kherson and Mykolaiv. There are regular strikes across the Dnipro River and intermittent attempts to cross in small groups, though the size of the force does not threaten a larger operation at this stage. The effect is to fix Ukrainian forces. The AFRF are also continuing to conduct widespread and regular long-range strikes on Ukrainian training bases, airfields and critical national infrastructure. This campaign involves a combination of daily strikes using Geran-2 and Gerbera UAVs and periodic ballistic and cruise missile salvos. The campaign inflicts persistent damage but is highly unlikely to prove decisive this winter. Its greatest military impact is fixing Ukrainian air defence across the country and depleting Ukrainian and NATO air defence interceptor stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure the AFRF can continue these efforts, Russia contracted more than 400,000 additional troops in 2024, enabling the expansion of its forces despite a very high rate of casualties. Russia is anticipated to reduce its recruitment targets for 2025, but is still expected to recruit more personnel than it loses over this period. Russian forces were often suffering more than 200 personnel killed per day during 2024 with over 1,200 casualties per day towards the end of the year. A significant proportion of wounded are returned to service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is also significantly increasing the production of ammunition and key classes of equipment, with over 70,000 unified gliding and correction modules (UMPK) glide bombs ordered for 2025. However, a large proportion of ammunition for artillery is currently procured from North Korea and is of low quality. Russia is also likely to face reduced availability of armoured vehicles over 2025 as it depletes stores of old vehicles and must depend upon newly produced platforms to replace losses. The primary tactical problems the AFRF imposes on the AFU, however, will be unaffected by these considerations, as will be discussed later in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AFU continue to have to defend the entire 1,200-km line of contact. Although the Ukrainian Defence Forces – including police, border guards and other security functions – comprise some 800,000 personnel, most of these are fixed on tasks separate from combat operations. The available combat power of the AFU comprises less than 25% of the force. The need to defend such a broad front means that although in aggregate the force ratio between the AFU and Russian Operational Group of Forces is favourable, the actual force ratio between combat units in any given sector is between 1:2 and 1:6. This is because the Russian Operational Group of Forces does not include the security and whole support structure for the Russian Armed Forces, so a higher proportion consists of combat troops. In many sectors, the greatest challenge for the AFU is the shortage of combat troops. Although Ukraine is suffering heavy casualties, it does have reserves of manpower that can address this challenge. The biggest problems in achieving this, aside from equipment and armaments shortages, are training, personnel management and morale among troops who have been engaged in heavy fighting for three years and perceive a deteriorating tactical situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is endeavouring to increase the costs on the AFRF through the attrition of its forces and an expanded deep-strike campaign against Russian revenue-generating centres (such as oil refineries), operational stockpiles of ammunition and defence industrial facilities. If sustained, these attacks will have a significant effect on Russia’s ability to sustain the current scale of recruitment and military industrial mobilisation. However, this will take time. It therefore remains critical that Ukraine can hold the front for long enough to reap the rewards of its deep-strike campaign and the persistent attrition of Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Ukrainian political objectives – of bringing about a lasting peace – have many non-military dependencies as regards security guarantees and economic stability, the foremost military objective is the stabilisation of the front. For this to be possible, a range of tactical problems must be addressed which are currently enabling the AFRF to maintain a steady rate of advance. It is therefore essential that Ukraine and its international partners work to resolve the extant tactical problems to create the military conditions for a successful political conclusion of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tactical-context-and-the-russian-offensive-triangle&quot;&gt;Tactical Context and the Russian Offensive Triangle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the war is recognisable from early 2023, characterised by the artillery battle and layered defences of trenches and fortifications. Yet Russian adaptations have aggregated and become an offensive triangle of three primary combined arms that are creating competing dilemmas for Ukrainian forces. First, the AFRF continue to pin down Ukrainian ground forces on the line of contact with infantry and mechanised forces, much as in the second and third years of the conflict. Second, they prevent manoeuvre and inflict attrition with first-person view drones (FPVs), Lancet drones and artillery firing both high-explosive shells and scatterable mines. Although this was the case earlier in the conflict, the scale of wire-guided FPV employment and density of persistent ISR has further exacerbated the tactical challenges to resupply, casualty evacuation and the concealment and protection of prestige equipment. Third, the AFRF has increased its use of UMPK glide bombs against Ukrainian forces who are holding defensive positions. Although these were used in 2023, the massive expansion of this tactic in 2024, set to increase further in 2025, creates a competing dilemma: should the AFU hold and invest in static defensive positions to reduce attrition from FPVs and drone-enabled artillery, or retain mobility to avoid destruction from glide bomb strikes, which have the explosive yield to demolish or bury even well-prepared fortifications?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The return of the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) is the primary dynamic driving broader changes to how the AFRF is inflicting attrition of the AFU on the frontline. Prior to the introduction of the UMPK glide bomb at large scale, the VKS was a powerful but latent threat that was unable to venture too close to the frontlines due to Ukrainian air defences’ ability to inflict unacceptable losses on it. Should Ukraine’s supply of air-defence munitions run dry due to the long-running strategic air campaign targeting Ukrainian critical national infrastructure with one-way attack (OWA) UAVs and cruise missiles, Russian crewed aviation would regain the freedom to penetrate deep into Ukrainian territory and inflict much greater damage than is possible with uncrewed strike systems. This made the provision of Western air defence a priority line of effort which, along with Ukrainian adaptation and use of less technologically advanced short-range air defence to provide local defence and complement long-range systems, has been a success story. In the interim, the VKS were limited for the most part to contributing to the strategic air campaign or providing sporadic fire support with lofting munitions on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glide bombs gave the VKS teeth without the need to first achieve air superiority or gain the ability to penetrate Ukrainian airspace. A simple stand-off strike capability against which Ukraine has no effective countermeasures, the UMPK glide bombs comprises a conventional low-drag bombs modified with deployable wings and a cheap GNSS guidance kit. These are predominantly the FAB-500 and FAB-1500 aerial bomb, along with limited numbers of similar munitions of different yields. While these were initially considered individually dangerous but not game-changing, or even a sign of Russian desperation, their mass-producibility rapidly proved a key advantage. Due to the strength of Russia’s integrated air defence systems, the VKS has been able to launch glide bombs across the frontline with the crewed launch aircraft remaining at a safe distance of between 30 and 90 km, depending on the size and thus the glide efficiency of the bomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise in UMPK glide bomb production from 40,000 units in 2024 to 70,000 units anticipated in 2025, has significantly increased the number of Ukrainian troops killed during defensive operations. This has had numerous knock-on effects for the different arms and services, as they have been pushed to completely avoid observation of their positions, to disperse or seek concealment underground, and to rely on uncrewed or autonomous systems to keep and kill the enemy at arm’s length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AFU have imposed a different set of dilemmas on Russian forces. The AFU’s approach to defence in depth and to imposing attrition at longer range has made it very costly for Russian forces to make gains. This has limited Russia’s ability to build up tempo or to exploit breaches in defence lines. While Russia has found an effective formula for inflicting heavy casualties on Ukraine, it has not found a successful formula for breaching defences without taking massive losses in equipment and personnel. Russia can still succeed on these terms owing to its greater mass, but it is evident that despite several experimental approaches to assaults, Russia lacks an effective concept of offensive action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evolving-ground-close-combat-tactics&quot;&gt;Evolving Ground Close-Combat Tactics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground close-combat tactics differ considerably between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Russian forces have fixed combined-arms armies and divisions on key axes, with the regiments and battalions beneath rotated and replenished as they suffer losses. Russian units, upon entering the line, tend to conduct wide-ranging advances to contact in section strength, endeavouring to identify Ukrainian positions. First, they send sections/squads of poorly trained troops, perhaps eight personnel at a time (although some larger attacks consist of up to 30 personnel supported by one or two infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs)). These are ordered to advance towards where they assess Ukrainian positions to be, conducting reconnaissance by drawing fire. If the group encounters resistance, Russian commanders assess where they believe the best lines of approach are, and in particular, where the boundaries between defensive units lie. If Ukrainian positions are positively identified, sections are persistently sent forward to attack positions, which are further mapped and then targeted with artillery, FPVs and UMPK glide bombs. When rotation or disruption of the defence is achieved, Russian units aim to conduct more deliberate assault actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian assault actions consist of armoured vehicles or light mobility vehicles endeavouring to transport troops as close to Ukrainian positions as possible before the infantry rush the positions; battle drills, direct fire control and fire and manoeuvre are either primitive or absent. Russian troops that make it into cover will often lie low and await successive waves to follow until a critical mass of troops have entered the defensive positions, at which point they will rush to the defenders. Actions are rarely above section size, unless fog or peculiarities of the defence favour a larger attack, in which case, platoon actions are sometimes launched, followed up with attacks to clear the positions, utilising better trained and -equipped troops. The tempo of attacks tends to be high when the Russian unit initially deploys. One Ukrainian brigade outlined an average tempo of 27 section attacks per day along part of its sector. However, the tempo tends to diminish and become more deliberate as the unit suffers casualties, until it has taken 30% casualties and is rotated. The constant use of artillery, FPVs and UMPK glide bombs makes it very difficult for Ukrainian defenders to hold positions if they face an intact attack force. Ukrainian forces therefore seek to anticipate the routes to be used for attacks each day and lay anti-personnel (AP) and anti-tank (AT) mines and prepare fires to engage Russian troops before they engage the positions in direct fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian troops report that North Korean troops operated quite differently when they originally entered the conflict. North Korean troops tended to conduct attacks in company or battalion strength on a single sector. The Ukrainians were able to inflict mass casualties during these attacks, but the North Koreans often overwhelmed the Ukrainian defenders’ positions, which were sparse, optimised to counter Russian tactics. North Korean troops were reportedly fit, motivated and aggressive and had good internal unit cohesion. After losing approximately a quarter of their initial force, however, they have begun to adopt and learn Russian tactics to better conserve their manpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian troops’ willingness to continue attacking even when they suffer heavy casualties appears to have a range of explanations. First, Russian troops are routinely threatened with being “zeroed”/“nullified” or executed if they retreat from an attack. In practice, they are often punished by being assigned to future attacks under unfavourable conditions. It is therefore often safer for Russian soldiers to go to ground – rather than retreat – and await more Russian troops to arrive. Propaganda about treatment if captured has also driven some Russian soldiers to commit suicide rather than be captured when injured, though this is not a widespread phenomenon. North Korean troops have shown a much higher tendency to commit suicide to avoid capture or if seriously wounded, either with a grenade or by “rolling onto the rifle”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and Ukraine rely on extensive digging and concealment to create uncertainty about where their main defensive strongpoints are, utilising many dummy and decoy positions. Russian platoons regularly occupy defensive positions dug to the specifications of a company position according to Russian doctrine. Frontages are covered by mixed AP and AT minefields, preventing enemy forces from manoeuvring or rapidly approaching. Russian formations seed minefields systematically, whereas Ukrainian forces – partly owing to limitations on supply – tend to seed mines on axes and terrain features where they anticipate the Russians will carry out deliberate attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian tactics, are premised upon extending the depth of their fires and dispersing their force to avoid casualties. The pervasive threat from fires causes units to dig extensively, by hand in the forward positions, and to reduce force density. There is admittedly variation by brigade and across different terrain. Some units favour greater concentration, relying on their ability to hide and employ decoys and reversionary positions to which they are able to relocate, while others revert to greater dispersion. The range for an infantry section’s area of responsibility is 70–200 m, with troops often occupying fighting positions separated by approximately 50 m, in fireteams of two to three personnel. One brigade reported holding a 27 km-frontage with just four battalions. The exact design and layout of fighting positions, trenches and dug-outs vary from unit to unit and depending on available time, equipment and materials. The low density across the unit’s frontage is partly made up for in depth, with an infantry company arrayed over 3 km of depth under a battalion in approximately 7 km of depth. The range of offensive engagements by the unit is often 10–15 km depending on its capabilities. The preference is to maximise attrition beyond line of sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armoured vehicles are used for both indirect and direct fire, though the latter is currently preferred. The threat from enemy FPVs means that tanks and infantry fighting vehicles must be concealed and ideally dug in, usually within 3 km of the frontline if they are assigned to combat roles. Because of the high latency of FPV sorties, armoured fighting vehicles tend to sally forwards from these hides to engage in direct-fire missions to break up enemy assault actions. The vehicles then return to their protected hides before they can be targeted. Tank-on-tank engagements have increased in regularity because of these tactics. It is noteworthy that every Ukrainian brigade aims to field a company or battalion of tanks, with availability varying considerably between formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian offensive tactics differ from those of the AFRF in that they tend to be very deliberate, with extensive intelligence collection and setting of conditions. For example, the offensive into Kursk involved up to a month of preparatory collection and shaping fires, even though the initial break-in comprised a two-point breach at a small scale. Ukrainian assault detachments conduct careful mission rehearsal and rarely operate in groups above 20 personnel. The assault troops trained and used for this purpose tend also be held in reserve and recovered when they have completed their combat task, to be replaced by ground-holding line infantry. All assault actions, however, must be enabled by fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fires-attrition-in-depth&quot;&gt;Fires: Attrition in Depth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shorter-ranged tactical fires have been shaped by Ukrainian improvements in electronic protection and the expanded use of FPVs by both Russian and Ukrainian forces. FPVs have been improved with autonomous terminal guidance and wire spools, which render them impervious to electronic disruption. While reports from Ukrainian operators indicate that this type of wired-control link comes with some downsides – including degraded flight performance, a comparatively limited range of approximately 10 km and running the risk of entanglement with obstacles – it provides a reliable means of penetrating areas of heavy jamming of GPS and radio frequencies which would otherwise make strikes impossible, and of overcoming tactical electronic countermeasures in the terminal attack phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Ukrainian formations field a mix of attack UAVs, ranging from light and heavy bomber drones to FPVs. Most brigades have a UAV company or battalion, and dedicated UAV units are allocated to support sections of front between 40 and 70 km wide. As Ukrainian forces do not yet widely employ wire-guided FPVs, the timing of when they can conduct strikes depends on gaps in electronic protection. These gaps can be induced through the suppression of enemy electronic warfare (EW) using artillery, or through planned pauses in friendly jamming to enable strike systems to get airborne. Generally, FPV and bomber operations are cued with intelligence and by quadcopter spotter drones, or by longer-range fixed-wing reconnaissance UAVs. FPV fire missions tend to be coordinated from battalion and brigade command posts. Different systems are optimised for different targets and times of the day. Bomber drones tend to deliver a heavier payload and so reliably do more damage to targets. However, their slow speed and need to hover above the target means they are predominantly employed at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tactical UAVs have significant limitations. Between 60 and 80% of Ukrainian FPVs fail to reach their target, depending on the part of the front and the skill of the operators. Of those that do strike their targets, a majority fail to destroy the target system when striking armoured vehicles. The success rate in wounding infantry is high. Furthermore, there are long periods where either EW or the weather significantly degrades UAV operations. With FPVs that are remotely piloted by radio frequency, it is also difficult to concentrate multiple drones in time and space because they can interfere with one another’s guidance systems. Despite these limitations, tactical UAVs currently account for 60–70% of damaged and destroyed Russian systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above figure must be read in the appropriate context. During extended discussions with Ukrainian officers on multiple axes and from multiple brigades – two of which had an exceptionally high rates of efficiency with FPVs – the officers repeatedly reiterated that they needed artillery. They emphasised that UAVs alone were inadequate and that they were most effective when used in combination with artillery. For example, artillery was effective at suppressing or displacing EW and air defences or suppressing infantry protecting key targets from bomber UAVs. Artillery was also able to defend the front in poor weather and was generally more responsive. Combined UAV and artillery operations often maximised the destruction achieved with, for example, an FPV immobilising a vehicle and artillery killing dismounts as they emerged. To give an example of the difference, a fires officer described the hours it had taken to plan and eventually immobilise a tank using FPVs, compared with an engagement where a platoon of Russian tanks were manoeuvring and, having located them with a drone, he fired five BONUS shells at them, knocking out all three tanks within two minutes. The pervasiveness of the threat of FPVs, however, which can hunt while their crews are relatively safe, makes them a persistent cause of attrition. Ukrainian commanders would like to inflict casualties on Russian forces from approximately 15 km from their defence lines, with the persistent threat of FPVs forcing the Russians to move quickly rather than deliberately and therefore making them more susceptible to canalisation from artillery- or drone-deployed mines, and thereafter broken up with artillery. Although these combined strikes are most effective, Ukrainian officers noted that they were rarely able to bring about this layered effect because of a scarcity of artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons for such a high proportion of kills being caused by FPVs is the relative lack of artillery in Ukrainian units. A brigade responsible for defending 18 km of front noted that it had four working howitzers. 152mm- and 122mm-howitzer rounds are in very short supply. Although 155mm shells are available in considerably greater volume than earlier in the conflict, artillery officers noted that they had few guns and limited spares. They also often had shells, but few accompanying charges. It may be that ammunition and spares are being stockpiled to hedge against the risk of disruption of supply during the forthcoming political manoeuvring over negotiations, as higher formations appeared more comfortable with their level of supply. For the brigades, while shells were available, charge bags were far scarcer, so that few guns were equipped for engaging at long range. Units also almost exclusively had access to high-explosive shells and some artillery-deployed mines, with very occasional access to dual-purpose improved conventional munitions (DPICM), and almost no availability of BONUS shells or other specialised ammunition. The ability to fire proper groupings of shells was also inhibited by the fact that units were receiving propellent charges sourced from a wide range of countries, which varied considerably in composition and quality, and thus in accuracy. While updates to the Kropyva fire control application used by the AFU can include pre-loaded adjustments to account for common national variants, the persistent challenges introduce inefficiency into the provision of fire support and exemplify the second-order effects of piecemeal and uncoordinated industrial support. Taken together, these mean that artillery is currently significantly underperforming, even when it is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground combat brigades generally suffer particularly acute shortages of artillery munitions, as artillery brigades have remained the priority for resupply due to their more refined ability to coordinate and conduct targeting and fire missions in their respective areas of operation. While some of this is mitigated by artillery liaison officers posted to the ground combat brigades which they support, this nevertheless results in periodic delays in fire support due to differing targeting priorities and views of where the expenditure of limited munitions supplies should be prioritised at different echelons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tactics for employing artillery have evolved considerably in response to the pervasive threat from UAVs. Both Russian and Ukrainian gunners separate guns by more than 500 m and keep ammunition caches concealed and separated from the firing position. Firing positions are dug in with protection on the sides and above, netting, and in some cases, plates mounted as a sheath around exposed components like barrels. Guns operate from hides with a cluster of prepared firing positions and associated decoy positions. The decoys are also redeployed when weather or other conditions allow. Guns tend to fire for a protracted period as the dug-in positions offer significant protection from counter-battery fire, the volume of which is itself reduced by the dispersion of guns. However, the guns move periodically to avoid being engaged by glide bombs, which are powerful enough to obviate the defences. Gunners note that the small payloads of UAVs can cause damage to their pieces, but they are usually repairable. This has led to a faster rate of barrel replacement than would arise from firing alone. Ukrainian forces have found it necessary to keep resupply vehicles much further back than pre-war doctrine suggests and to resupply ammunition when conditions are favourable, rather than in response to consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engineering-and-fortification&quot;&gt;Engineering and Fortification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building defensive positions is fundamental to survivability on the battlefield for both Russian and Ukrainian forces, along all sectors of the frontline. Due to the fires threat, excavation equipment is rarely brought closer than 7 km to the front, meaning that most defensive positions must be prepared by hand. For infantry soldiers manually moving large volumes of soil with picks and shovels, the work is arduous and time consuming. This has resulted in ground combat units often struggling to build adequate defensive structures. Incorporating overhead protection, whether hard cover or simply concealment from observation, has proven difficult to achieve at the correct scale, especially where there is limited foliage or other natural material to exploit. If units are rotated, they do not directly benefit from their labour, and in areas where multiple units have been rotated within a short time, this has been noted as disincentivising digging in, despite standing orders that make units responsible for making progressive improvements to the defences in any area in which they are deployed. These are of course longstanding and well understood issues, with historical precedent in most large-scale ground wars throughout the last century, but they have become particularly problematic given the overhead observation and fires threat on the current frontline. Ukrainian units often use separate troops to prepare positions back from the line of contact to avoid exhausting their infantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the operational level, Ukraine has increasingly depended on combat engineering for force protection, digging in and concealing headquarters, logistics depots and artillery positions. Much of this must still be conducted by ground combat units, due to the high level of threat. Construction of decoy and reversionary positions and hides is a major task. While much of this is conducted by different arms – for example, artillery units are responsible for many of their decoys and hides – combat engineers remain invaluable for their ability to quickly construct such positions with heavy mechanised equipment. Artillery positions and command posts often require significant excavation work, with all command posts buried to reduce the threat of observation and effective indirect fire. Although engineers cannot often move forward, they can help to prepare cages and steel nets that are erected over defensive positions closer to the line of contact to protect from strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combat engineers also have important functions within the ground combat units. The extensive use of mines has meant that mine clearing is an essential task for offensive action. Ukraine continues to use both hand clearing and mechanised breaching, with Vincent and line-breaching systems like UR-77, utilised where speed is required. The laying of mines is another area where engineers are widely employed, working closely with reconnaissance troops and intelligence staffs to judge the appropriate siting of mines, and then working with artillery and UAV troops to emplace them. Ukrainian forces tend to use mines to canalise attacks and slow down enemy tempo, thereby enabling them to inflict casualties on Russian units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bridging also remains a persistent if thankless task for engineering units. Because of the pervasive observation on the battlefield, bridges are routinely struck. This has meant that ferries and watercraft have a critical function. Filling in minor gaps and shorter-term bridging solutions has proven vital for assault and resupply operations. In these cases, volume of equipment is critical – as it is lost and fixed in large quantities – but sophistication of equipment is largely redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reconnaissance-mass-observation&quot;&gt;Reconnaissance: Mass Observation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conduct of reconnaissance for both Russian and Ukrainian forces has been almost exclusively conducted by UAVs. Ukrainian artillery brigades field ISR battalions operating long-range reconnaissance UAVs. Each ground combat brigade generally has an independent UAV company or battalion that is responsible for conducting deep reconnaissance as well as the fires engagements outlined above. In addition, each battalion is required to generate four to six orbits of UAVs to support its HQ, with four dedicated to combat management and two to conducting battlefield reconnaissance. Artillery batteries and infantry companies also field significant numbers of UAVs, both to maintain situational awareness and to search for enemy positions or observe trigger points for other activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian approaches to ISR are similar. Along with long-range reconnaissance from Orlan and Zala UAVs working at operational depth, Russian combat groups tend to endeavour to maintain five orbits of observation over an axis of advance. They also tend to keep UAVs above their own forces for combat management, in line with their top-down command structure and centrally directed approach to operations. Although FPVs and Lancet loitering munitions are not recovered, they can also be used to actively hunt for targets and confirm the position of enemy that they overfly, such that these strike systems provide a reconnaissance function. They also often prompt ground units to fire at them, revealing their positions. The aggregate consequence of this dense and overlapping network of UAVs is battlefield transparency within 3 km of the line of contact, with diminishing density of observation out to 15 km of depth. Beyond this, reconnaissance is more deliberate, with the picture depending on where commanders assign UAV orbits. However, commanders can generally task reconnaissance capabilities with reasonable fidelity and latency out to 40 km of depth. Beyond this range, satellite reconnaissance often cues areas of interest for longer ranged UAVs to be tasked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The command and control of the reconnaissance screen has centralised at the battalion and brigade/regimental level in both Russian and Ukrainian forces. Generally, each UAV orbit will maintain a satellite uplink and stream its footage to the battalion and brigade command posts, where the intelligence officer, fires officer, and the commander’s representative will assess what is observed, determine options and authorise actions to be taken in response to what is observed. Both Russian and Ukrainian forces, for reasons of doctrine and culture, do not generally use fire controllers in combat units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wider intelligence and surveillance enterprise is bolstered by the extensive use of electronic surveillance and the interception of communications by both sides. Ukrainian EW has matured and expanded over the course of the war. Tracking EW defences is an absolute requirement for successful UAV operations, as it affects the flight plan and the timing of when UAVs are launched. Direction finding is also used as a means of cueing UAV orbits. Interception of tactical communications is critical as an indicator of enemy intent and is therefore provided to most brigades staffs to assist in the conduct of operations within their sector of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;medical-support-and-casualty-evacuation&quot;&gt;Medical Support and Casualty Evacuation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to stabilise, evacuate and treat casualties not only is critical to a force’s resilience as regards the recovery of combat troops and retention of experience within the force, but also often underpins the morale of units. The tactical problems described above have made the treatment and evacuation of casualties and recovery of the dead extremely difficult. First, with a force density of sections covering up to 200 m of front, and individual battalions distributed through 7 km of depth, it is not viable to have medics persistently present on the fighting positions. Second, the distance between fighting positions, and the extent to which the intervening space is covered by precision fires from FPVs, makes it prohibitively dangerous for medics to reach wounded personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tactical response to this problem has initially been to train personnel on medical interventions so that they can stabilise their own wounds. The medic in this context often crews a radio and talks the casualty through the necessary procedures. It has been found that this function is critical, even when it is a medic who is wounded, because while shock often gives a casualty the ability to work on themselves for a period, it also significantly impairs decision making and judgement. It has also been found that having a medic centrally track timings, especially for the application of tourniquets, has helped to reduce the number of amputations required because of tourniquets being kept on for too long. Supplies of medical equipment have thereafter been delivered to casualties in place using UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recovery of casualties can be achieved more safely if it is part of a deliberate operation and carried out under favourable conditions of fog and heavy rain, and at night. The evacuation procedure must be planned carefully and often requires the use of artillery and obscurants to suppress enemy artillery or divert their attention. This is achievable but means that the commander cannot recover casualties immediately in response to their being taken. The interval between someone being wounded and recovered can therefore be from a few hours if they are wounded under favourable conditions, up to a matter of days if weather and battlefield conditions make the tactical context for evacuation unfavourable. Where soldiers are badly wounded, comrades do often take significant risk to achieve an accelerated recovery, but while this comradeship is commendable, under most tactical situations, this tends to lead to multiple casualties being suffered. Experimentation has started with the recovery of the wounded on uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs). At present, however, the reliability of these systems is insufficient for forces to be confident in such methods, and the use of such prototypes is limite. Once casualties are recovered, medical posts must be in the rear, dispersed, and hardened, so that surgery can be carried out safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important operation is the recovery of the dead. In some respects, although the recovery of the dead is easier – owing to it not having the same time constraints – the Russians have taken to booby-trapping bodies or keeping dead Ukrainians under observation. Thus, the mapping of the positions of the dead, confirmation through ISR of their condition, and recovery must also be a deliberate operation. The importance of this activity relates to morale. To be recorded as killed rather than missing in action, it is necessary for remains to be recovered. This difference affects eligibility for compensation to be paid to families, so soldiers see it as very important. This dynamic has increased the impact of glide bombs on morale, because they have enough explosive to entirely obliterate those caught in the blast and bury those in the vicinity, leaving no recoverable corpse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that Russian approaches to casualties differ to Ukrainian approaches, reflecting the motivation of their troops. While Ukrainian troops overwhelmingly refer to their duty to defend Ukraine and their families from Russian occupation as their reason for fighting, Russian prisoners of war largely describe their motivations as financial. Whereas Ukrainian troops often leave their families worse off – as they receive less pay in the armed forces than in civilian employment – by joining the military, Russian troops receive bonuses, making fighting a lucrative endeavour. Moreover, the compensation for being killed paid to the family is high enough to give families an altered standard of living, though payments for being wounded are reducing. Russian troops appear less motivated to recover their wounded or their dead. Medical support is prioritised for those who can self-recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;logistics-resupply-and-rotation&quot;&gt;Logistics, Resupply and Rotation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tactical resupply has become a major challenge for the same reasons as medical evacuation. Ukrainian brigades report that approximately 50% of their casualties are taken in the rear from Russian FPVs, artillery and glide bombs. Rotation of troops, pushing supplies forward and recovering damaged equipment all lead to personnel moving in the open and are risky endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first tactical adaptation driven by the threat is to minimise the number of rotations, with troops spending over a month in their positions before being rotated. If the positions are appropriately built, commanders reported that this approach was more popular than endeavouring to rotate regularly, since the risks of rotation now outweigh the benefits of rest in rear areas. When rotations are conducted, it is the same deliberate operation as described in relation to medical evacuation, and is supported by fires and EW, while being executed at night and during periods of inclement weather or reduced visibility. There is a challenge in this because periods of reduced visibility are also favoured for Russian assault actions, and when the rotation is poorly managed, it can enable Russian troops to get into fighting positions. In several cases rotations allowed the flanks of neighbouring units to be turned, forcing the withdrawal of the line. For this reason, the Russians have preferred fixing their divisions and combined arms armies to axes, with the regiments rotating their battalions, such that the commanders have a protracted exposure to and understanding of the terrain. Ukrainian commanders argue for a similar approach, with higher echelons, with long-term familiarity with the geography, managing this process, given that problems are most acute when fresh units are endeavouring to take over positions. The announcement that Ukraine will establish Army Corps is partly aimed at resolving this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once troops are on the positions, the challenge of resupply is being partly addressed through the use of UAVs to deliver ammunition and rations forwards. It has even proven possible on occasion for a unit’s chefs to prepare fresh food for units and for this to be delivered in packages via UAVs to dispersed elements of the force, thereby removing the risk of casualties during the operation. Weight is a limitation for this method – such that it is difficult to resupply heavy equipment to the forward positions – and another factor that caps the viable force density that can be sustained across a given area. UGVs may assist with the limitations on weight, but officers noted in interview that their reliability was a persistent problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For artillery and mortar ammunition and when reinforcement of a position must be carried out under critical conditions, the use of either HMMWVs (Humvees) or M113 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) is preferred by Ukrainian troops. Both are liked because of their speed and mobility on difficult terrain, reducing the period of exposure and enabling survivability. For Russian forces, there is a similar division between the use of light utility vehicles and bikes to move supplies quickly, and Tigr-M, MRAP-type vehicles, or BMP or MTLB armoured vehicles for resupply, depending on the equipment available to the unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area of adaptation is the increasing of and changing approach to caching equipment. For artillery, Russian forces have begun to cache ammunition within a retrievable distance from their guns but separate from the firing position. Ukrainian personnel use similar methods. The advantage of this approach is that it allows heavy equipment to be brought forward by a larger vehicle when the weather permits, but for this equipment to then be accessible to the fighting units when there is a need for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;long-range-strike-air-defence-and-electronic-protection&quot;&gt;Long-Range Strike, Air Defence and Electronic Protection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air defence challenge must be broken down into the protection of forces and the protection of terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-protection-of-forces&quot;&gt;The Protection of Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each day in August 2024, Ukrainian air defenders reported that Russia was flying between 1,000 and 1,500 Orlan-10 and Zala reconnaissance UAV orbits deep over Ukrainian positions. By 2025, Ukraine had managed to reduce, though not eliminate, the density of these systems through the employment of networked radar and electro-optical guidance of interceptor UAVs that have inflicted steady losses on Russian ISR. Nevertheless, the density of observation has prevented Ukraine from pushing air defences forward. When this has been attempted, Russia has successfully found and engaged these targets, usually with 9M723 ballistic missiles. The short-ranged air defence that remain survivable offer some deterrent value against the VKS pushing further into Ukrainian air space. As detailed above, however, this does not prevent the VKS from delivering glide bombs from outside the engagement envelope of Ukrainian defensive surface-to-air missiles (SAMs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic protection of troops has become indispensable for both sides to reduce the exposure of units to strikes by UAVs. The Russian transfer to fibre-optical cable for guidance of FPVs may disrupt the approach to EW, but at present, navigational jamming is ubiquitous throughout the combat area. Jamming of command frequences is also widespread. Most vehicles entering the combat zone also carry jammers, primarily aimed at disrupting command links or video feeds to reduce the terminal accuracy of FPVs. EW is effective in significantly reducing the reliability of UAVs and disrupting the accurate fixing of targets to cue strikes. However, it is also causing widespread issues with deconfliction and fratricide causes friendly UAV operations to be periodic rather than continuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-protection-of-territory&quot;&gt;The Protection of Territory&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a different matter. Russia has adopted a two-track approach to strikes. The first involves continuous harassment with Geran-2 and Gerbera UAVs. Some fly low, but mostly, the Russians fly high to make the means of interception as expensive as possible. These UAVs tend to be routed to strike airfields, training areas, transformer sub-stations and industrial facilities. The UAVs are usually sent in waves, with data pushed back from the first UAVs to inform the path taken by subsequent UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine now has a dense network of EW effectors and passive sensors that can track the progress of air threats across the country. The most efficient means of shooting down Geran-2 and Gerbera UAVs flying at a higher altitude include helicopters and combat air patrols. Generally, Ukraine endeavours to wear down the waves of UAVs over a significant distance using a distributed defence, so that the point defences at the eventual target – ranging from self-propelled anti-aircraft guns and mobile fire teams with heavy machine guns, to man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS) teams and SAM systems – have to engage as few targets as possible. These methods have proven successful, with the vast majority of OWA-UAVs intercepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value Russia gains in conducting the OWA strikes is less about the damage inflicted than it is about the data gathered in mapping EW and air defence systems and forcing Ukraine to expend stocks. Russia is currently set to produce in 2025 more than 750 9M723 ballistic missiles and more than 560 Kh-101 cruise missiles, according to plans drawn up by the Russian Ministry of Defence. It will therefore continue to deliver salvos at intervals. When the authors reviewed the tracks of these engagements, it is evident that they are carefully planned. Russian cruise missiles are often routed to avoid EW defences before their terminal phase. They also move to avoid air defence positions and are often synchronised so that they approach the target in a short period of time from several directions. Russia has also made substantial improvements to the construction of systems. As well as adding a wider variety of warheads – including cluster warheads – to Kh-101, they have upgraded the camera and processing units such that it can perform much better visual terrain tracking, and thereby avoid disruption from EW during its terminal phase. The missile is also now dispensing countermeasures, which can be used to protect it when crossing the positions of MANPADS teams. The result is that although Ukraine does achieve many intercepts, Russia usually damages or destroys what it targets during these strikes. Nevertheless, Russia has not been able to strike frequently enough or exercise sufficient discipline in the target sets it engages to inflict critical damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s long-range strike campaign against Russia has been constrained by having far fewer strike systems than Russia, but has been at least as sophisticated, if not more so, in its route planning and integration. Ukraine has become highly efficient at routing UAVs to bypass much of Russia’s air defences. Russia has responded by placing SA-22 Pantsir SAM systems on towers around most critical targets. Nevertheless, Ukrainian planners have found that by firing a sufficiently large salvo of UAVs at a target, it is often possible to saturate the available air defence and – when available – sequence the use of cruise missiles or larger payload UAVs for later in the engagement, such that by the time more destructive munitions arrive, the air defences are depleted. This has led to a remarkably high success rate for Ukraine in damaging targets, though with a very high expenditure of UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-support-to-ukraine&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Support to Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Ukrainian forces are successfully delaying Russian advances and inflicting significant casualties, this is being achieved at a high price in personnel, while Ukrainian force generation is failing to meet the requirements of the force. This is the foremost problem that must be addressed if Ukraine’s defence is to be sustainable. There is no “silver bullet” solution. Some international partners are currently emphasising the extension of conscription to 18-year-olds, but this will not address the key problems. The recommendations that follow, therefore, constitute a package of measures aimed at addressing this issue, which requires work from both the Ukrainian government and its international partners to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest risk to the AFU in the short term is a collapse in morale among the veterans of the core brigades. Currently, morale is low. There are four primary contributing factors to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, many experienced troops are extremely tired and feel that they have sacrificed disproportionately compared with wider society. Recent increases in desertion have not been confined to mobilised troops, although many deserters have returned to the ranks in time, sometimes having transferred unit, but often simply having rested. The lack of rotation is a major issue. Rotating brigades off the line for rest and training would significantly improve morale and fighting power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Ukrainian troops feel increasingly powerless owing to the threat from glide bombs, against which no fortification offers adequate protection, and the AFU has limited means available at tactical echelons for shooting down either the bombs or the fighters launching them. This sense of being unable to improve the situation and lacking any tactical tools to ensure safety is corrosive to morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, low pay and the lack of compensation for unrecovered dead means that many soldiers see their families becoming poorer as a result of their service. For those contemplating joining the armed forces, volunteering is to not only accept significant personal risk, but also sacrifice the financial security of their family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, because experienced commanders and units are rarely rotated off the line, there is a tendency to have new units formed and then attached to existing brigades. This leads to experienced battalions being depleted, while new battalions lack the skills to fight effectively. Moreover, equipment often goes to the new units even though these units lacked the experienced officers and junior leaders to employ that equipment effectively, while veteran units often make do with sub-standard equipment. It is notable that cohered brigades where the battalions are organic to the unit consistently perform better on the frontline than composite units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations to Ukraine to address this multifaceted problem are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s international partners should work with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence to improve the pay offer to troops and ensure there is the finance to cover this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legislation on compensation to families should be altered so that if a body can be photographed and geo-located, this is sufficient for compensation to be released, rather than there being a need to recover the body.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine should stop forming new combat units and instead prioritise bringing existing units up to strength, with the priority being experienced units. This change is already being implemented but it must be accompanied with the rotation of units off the line so that veterans can help to train replacements while also resting and carry out collective training away from the front.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s international partners should shift to delivering training and advice in Ukraine on Ukrainian training areas, rather than trying to train Ukrainian troops outside of Ukraine. It is not realistic to move experienced units, with their equipment, to France or Germany, regardless of the theoretical advantages, so endeavouring to deliver collective training outside Ukraine will drive attempts to create new units who lack experienced troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International partners should also prioritise exploring solutions to the threat from glide bombs. The most likely means of achieving effects in this area are to resource Ukraine’s long-range strike programme to target fuelling and rearming points and air bases of the VKS. International partners should also consider reducing the serviceability of Russian strike aircraft by further degrading Russia’s aviation sector. Reducing the sortie rate of the VKS should be the priority. As this will take time to have an impact, improving the ability of units to detect and react to UMPK glide bomb releases would give personnel some capacity to adopt countermeasures. Options for intercepting glide bombs may be explored but are unlikely to be fieldable at large scale within a short space of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morale is also underpinned by having competitive equipment. Although equipment levels – especially relating to 155 mm artillery ammunition – have improved over recent months, there are serious shortcomings in the equipment available to Ukrainian brigades, which should be prioritised for those providing military technical assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the need to expand production of explosive energetics and shells remains. Ukrainian officials report that they received approximately 1.6 million 155 mm shells in 2023 and 1.5 million in 2024. As the availability and quality of shells on the international market decreases, more will need to come from production lines. Investment must be sustained in Europe to expand industrial capacity in this area. But Ukraine’s ammunition availability is not relevant if it does not have serviceable artillery pieces. It is therefore also critical that industrial efforts in Europe are rationalised to ensure a supply of replacement barrels and other spare parts for donated fleets, and that the number of howitzers provided to the AFU is increased. In regards to fires, this should be done alongside the financing and increased scaling of UAV production, as the two capabilities are complementary. Both areas will be critical to European defence, so investing in this industrial capacity is a win-win for European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanisation is also critical to battlefield survivability. Infantry fighting vehicles and lighter tanks are disproportionately valuable for the mobile reinforcement of sectors under pressure in the defence. APCs, meanwhile, are indispensable for logistics, medical support, troop rotation and offensive action. The number of vehicles required means that while modern infantry fighting vehicles are a significant combat multiplier, they are also overly expensive and complex for a large proportion of the tasks for which APCs are equally capable and much more affordable. Ukraine’s international partners should therefore prioritise the continued mechanisation of Ukrainian units with both IFVs and APCs. The priority for both is serviceability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several areas which are currently personnel-intensive but which could be significantly improved through automation. One is air defence and counter-UAS pickets. Ukrainian experimentation has demonstrated that automated turrets are able to reliably engage UAS using very little ammunition, whereas humans have approximately 25% efficiency when defending the targeted position. Human capabilities in this area may be improved with better sights and more appropriate small arms, but automated turrets offer a very high level of interception and can be produced at a reasonable cost. The automation of weapons currently given to mobile fire teams also offers a means of improving point defence of targets against longer-range UAVs. International partners should also support expanding the capacity of automated resupply of the fighting positions through UAS, and the development of UGVs for casualty evacuation, with the added benefit that these capabilities will also have utility for Ukraine’s partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as the fighting is currently progressing, Russia is slowly working its way through the Donetsk defence lines. The terrain behind these positions is largely flat, open and much less defensible. While it should be hoped that Ukraine can hold Russian forces in Donetsk, international partners should help with contingency planning on the erection of new defence lines, their proper siting, and planning for when Ukrainian forces move to these positions. Current efforts in this area by non-combat troops are inadequate, due to fragmented initiatives lacking coordination and often without the relevant military engineering expertise to inform contractors where and how to position fortifications and trenches. The best opportunity is to build pre-emptively, while the absence of high-density tactical observation and massed fires makes mechanised engineering possible. Digging major subterranean defences with overhead protection serves multiple purposes. It obfuscates precise Ukrainian force dispositions and creates uncertainty about where they are concentrated. It enables covered movement between forward positions and rear areas, and with sufficient structural reinforcement and multiple entries and exits can prevent troops being entombed by glide bombs if hardened fortifications are unfortunate enough to suffer close hits during combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-nato&quot;&gt;Recommendations for NATO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be emphasised that although Russia is putting increasing pressure on Ukraine, it is also becoming more economically vulnerable domestically and is running low across several armoured vehicle fleets. The quality of Russian infantry also continues to decline. Continuing to support Ukraine to bring about a sustainable peace should therefore be the foremost priority of European NATO as a means of reducing the threat to Europe and thereby reducing the likelihood that Europe will have to fight in the future. A sustainable peace requires that Russia is deterred from recommencing hostilities and that Ukraine has a viable economy that cannot be coercively supressed by Russian threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, if the situation in Ukraine deteriorates, Europe must depend upon its conventional deterrence capabilities. Learning lessons from the Russo–Ukrainian War, therefore, is important. In the current phase of the war, several deductions can be drawn relevant to NATO militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disproportionate impact of the VKS, despite the generally poor performance of Russian airpower, validates the importance placed on air power across NATO, and this area of competitive advantage should be sustained. Increasing stockpiles and the capacity to produce long-range air-to-air munitions and stand-off strike weapons at as low a cost as possible should be critical priorities for the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to expand the duration and complexity of long-range strike capabilities is also highly desirable. This means that investing in the production of jet engines, rocket motors and guidance and navigation units in Europe to initially provide to Ukraine’s long-range strike programme would subsequently leave Europe with the industrial capabilities to sustain large-scale strike operations against Russian logistics and infrastructure in the event of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also evident that counter-UAS capabilities are an all-arms requirement for survivability, and appropriate equipment and doctrine must be issued throughout NATO forces. The priority must be economical and sustainable engagements, with the reprogramming of Remote Weapon Stations (RWS) the easiest immediate means of improving protection. Without counter-UAS capabilities, NATO militaries risk seeing high quality troops and equipment rapidly suffering losses for want of protection, when such effective protection is eminently achievable. This must be considered an all-arms concern. For infantry, for example, counter-drone nets and other simple stocks should be available alongside traditional stores like corrugated-iron or timber that can be used for augmentations to fortifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of IFV and APC production is severely limited by an over-emphasis on quality over quantity. Although IFV optics and other sensors are valuable, there is a need to improve the level of mechanisation and the sustainability of mechanised units. For this reason, European defence industry should be incentivised to expand the capacity to build drive trains and armoured hulls. In the UK, the maintenance of the Ajax production facility and a replacement for Bulldog should be industrial, as much as military, priorities. Training of close-support logistics units with armoured vehicles should be a priority, alongside tactics like containerisation, caching and UAV resupply for logistics troops organic to combat units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maximising the stand-off firepower of tactical formations should be a priority. In the first instance, scaling the use of wire-guided strike UAS within formations is sensible, but this should not be done at the expense of conventional artillery. European militaries should also carefully consider their commitments against the production and use of cluster munitions and should regenerate the ability to deploy AT and AP mines. Without these, they risk lacking both the required lethality to fight effectively, and the ability to reduce enemy mobility sufficiently to allow that lethality to be brought to bear. Explosive counter mobility capabilities may be achievable in a manner that is consistent with existing treaty obligations, due to technological advances, though some alterations to treaties to reflect technological advances may also be worth exploring. Stockpiling specialist munitions like BONUS shells is also a priority. Nevertheless, artillery will be damaged in war, and ensuring the industrial capacity to sustain an artillery capability is vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tactically, one of the areas of greatest importance for NATO militaries is the update of medical doctrine. Put simply, existing medical doctrine is not executable under modern combat conditions. Military medics are not equipped or prepared either for the scale of casualties involved in high intensity combat or the challenges of evacuating casualties and treating them in a rear area that is under persistent observation and the threat of strike. This is an area that could seriously degrade morale, even among highly professional troops, without preparing personnel with realistic expectations and appropriate drills, and should be prioritised for experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the character of the threat continues to evolve, it is important that NATO militaries ensure that they are adapting to meet the challenges of tomorrow, rather than perfecting the execution of past doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

The policy collisions to come will be transformative for transatlantic relations and will reshape the transatlantic alliance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is Part 1 in a two-part series titled “The Transatlantic Alliance in the Age of Trump.” Part 1 previews the coming collisions in transatlantic relations and whether a “grand bargain” between the United States and Europe to avoid conflict is plausible. It will examine the various policy areas where clashes are likely, examining NATO, Ukraine, technology, trade, climate, international organizations, and China policy. It will look at why collisions in each policy area are possible, how a dispute could escalate, and potential risks facing both sides. Part 2 will explore how the European political project may evolve as a result of the collisions discussed in Part 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Europe are on a collision course that will fundamentally alter and transform transatlantic relations. It is not just one issue that will trigger a clash but seemingly every issue. From NATO to Ukraine, climate to trade, tech regulations to China, the United States and Europe will likely clash, repeatedly and continuously. The impact of these collisions will be transformative for transatlantic relations and will reshape the transatlantic alliance. Europe is now staring at the beginning of a new post-American age. Since the end of World War II, Europe has been inextricably tied to the United States. While there have occasionally been rifts in the transatlantic fabric, these were always mendable. But the clashes that are coming may not be, and they may forever change the nature of transatlantic relations. Europe is now reckoning with a potential future where it may have to chart its own course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of the tension is that Europe and the United States under Donald Trump now have very different views of the transatlantic alliance and of the world. For Europe, relations with the United States have served as Europe’s North Star and the foundation of Europe’s foreign policy, and were treated with the utmost importance. Europe, today, desperately wants to preserve the alliance as it currently exists and ensure the United States’ continued place as the guarantor of European security. For the United States, Europe is seen as being of lesser importance. Even before President Trump’s return to office, Europe had become an afterthought to Washington. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the full-scale invasion in 2022—refocused U.S. attention on Europe, but only temporarily. NATO may have returned to its Cold War focus on deterring Russian power, but the United States has not. Nevertheless, there had still been a clear bipartisan consensus across administrations on the importance of the United States’ continued leadership in Europe as being core to U.S. global strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That bipartisan consensus had been weakening and now appears fully broken. President Donald Trump has a very different perspective toward Europe and NATO—one that sees less value in alliances. There appears to be very little interest in preserving the transatlantic status quo. Instead, the Trump administration has made clear that it wants to fundamentally change the present alliance dynamics. There is a sense in Trump’s Washington that Europe matters less in the world, and yet Europe is taking advantage of the U.S. security guarantee to ignore its defense responsibilities, all the while targeting U.S. companies with burdensome regulations. In the same week, JD Vance took the stage in Paris to denounce European technology regulations, while Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth clearly outlined that the United States would prioritize Asia and create a “division of labor” where Europe takes “responsibility for its own security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The president and his administration also appear to have little interest in Europe. In Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s initial call list, only Poland and NATO made the first fifteen calls (and neither were among the first ten). The United Kingdom was not included, despite the special relationship, and neither were France, Germany, or the European Union. Furthermore, there are few, if any, traditional transatlanticists in the second Trump administration to speak in favor of the alliance, as there were in the first Trump administration. There is also a reaction to Europe’s both real and perceived condescension toward Trump’s MAGA-inspired nationalism. Statements from European leaders and governments that criticized Trump or praised President Biden have accelerated an underlying angst toward Europe. This has led to a mood in Washington that resembles 2002 and 2003, around the Iraq War, which led to an explosion of anti-(Western) European sentiment, especially toward France and Germany for objecting to the U.S. invasion of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mix of apathy and angst toward Europe means it is likely that the Trump administration is willing to be extremely assertive and confrontational, including taking steps that may significantly weaken or undermine the transatlantic alliance. Trump’s remarks at Davos on January 23, 2025, and in other brief comments to the press made clear that a confrontation is coming, especially with the European Union. European appeals to being loyal NATO allies will likely have little resonance. Instead, the Trump administration is likely to demand concessions from Europe on all sorts of policy areas, all the while also seeking to fundamentally transform NATO by reducing its security presence and commitment to European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, though, the United States and Europe now have fundamentally different outlooks toward the world. Not since the U.S. invasion of Iraq have the United States and Europe been so far apart in outlook. In Of Paradise and Power from 2003, Robert Kagan described the United States and Europe as being from different planets; the martial Americans were from Mars, while the pacifist Europeans were from Venus. Now both sides appear to be from different centuries, with the Trump administration adopting an outlook of the predatory and imperialist 1890s, with the Europeans still rooted in the liberal triumphalism of the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report looks ahead at the coming collisions in transatlantic relations. It first examines whether a “grand bargain” between the United States and Europe to avoid conflict is plausible. Unfortunately, both due to political, policy, and structural reasons, reaching a grand deal across policy areas looks highly implausible. Next, the report analyzes and breaks down the various policy areas where clashes are likely, examining NATO, Ukraine, technology, trade, climate, international organizations, and China policy. It will look at why a collision is possible, how that could escalate, and potential risks to both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will make the coming collisions incredibly dynamic from a policy perspective is that they will interact with each other, facilitating either an escalatory or de-escalatory dynamic. This means that an escalating fight in one policy area could cause an even more bitter and aggressive fight in another policy area. Alternatively, should agreement or détente be achieved, such as in a tit-for-tat tariff war, that could create momentum for de-escalation in other areas. In short, the policy dynamic in the transatlantic relationship will be characterized by brinksmanship and tension. This will put the alliance on edge and could create an atmosphere of profound distrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Europe navigates the coming collisions will have significant repercussions for its future and the future of the transatlantic alliance and the global order. Despite U.S. conceptions that Europe is stagnant and in decline, Europe is in fact constantly evolving. The European Union looks very different today than it did 5, 10, and 20 years ago, and it will likely look very different at the end of the Trump administration. How Europe and its project may evolve will be the focus of the second report in this series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-coming-transatlantic-collisions&quot;&gt;The Coming Transatlantic Collisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Grand Bargain Is Unlikely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stave off a transatlantic rupture, it has been asserted that perhaps the United States and Europe could cut a deal or strike some sort of grand bargain. Europe, for instance, could make some concessions, perhaps agree to purchase more liquified natural gas from the United States, spend more on defense, buy more U.S. weapons, or make some trade concessions, in exchange for a relatively placid relationship and the continuation of the U.S. security commitment. But a transatlantic grand bargain is highly unlikely for the simple reason that the Trump administration looks determined to remake the partnership in a way that Europe will find unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching a grand bargain will require compromises on both sides, including the Trump administration. The crux of the issue is that any bargain will be rooted in a continued U.S. security presence in Europe. Thus, the question is whether the Trump administration will be willing to leave the U.S. security presence in Europe, and therefore, NATO, untouched as part of any deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many incoming Trump administration officials, as well as U.S. companies squeezed by EU regulations, want to use the U.S. security guarantee as a tool to extract concessions from Europe on economic, trade, and tech policy. During the presidential campaign, Vice President JD Vance linked U.S. security commitments through NATO to looser European tech regulation of Elon Musk’s social media platform, X. Yet the Trump administration has made clear that it is determined to fundamentally shift the burden of European security from the United States to Europe. This will likely mean a significant reduction in U.S. forces in Europe. The U.S. security guarantee will only serve as bargaining leverage over Europe if it is not materially weakened. Instead of making compromises, the Trump administration will likely, and in many ways understandably, not want to choose or prioritize. Instead, it will insist on Europe making major policy concessions, all the while also shifting the defense burden to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, once the United States treats Europe’s security as a hostage to be negotiated over, there is no reason why the United States cannot keep taking it hostage. For instance, should the European Union alter its technology regulations, effectively passing a new law to appease the Trump administration and to keep U.S. forces in place, what is there to prevent the United States from seeking ever more concessions on other issues, such as trade or carbon tariffs? The hostage—Europe’s security, in this case—is never actually released, as the United States can always threaten European security by pulling back in every follow-on policy clash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What may also trigger tension is that there is lack of trust. The Trump administration sees Europeans as feckless and willing to say the right things, such as about defense spending, but then failing to follow through. Europeans, meanwhile, are unlikely to trust the president to stick to any deal. The mere fact that President Trump has threatened to impose tariffs against Canada and Mexico, despite having negotiated the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) a few years ago, will likely raise concerns about entering any deal with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, even if both sides wanted a grand bargain, there are major structural obstacles. For the United States, making difficult policy trade-offs across sectors, especially between defense and economic areas, would be difficult for any administration. For Europe, the structural problems are even more profound, as economic and regulatory issues are completely disconnected from defense policy. The power to negotiate and retaliate on economic, regulatory, climate, and trade issues resides with the European Union, and more specifically with the European Commission, not with European member states. Yet when it comes to defense and security issues, the power lies not with the European Union but with member states and NATO. Member states can push the European Commission and pressure its president, Ursula von der Leyen, which could shape how the European Union responds or retaliates. But they cannot force the European Commission to not implement EU law or to change EU laws and policy. Moreover, member states are a diverse group and are unlikely to universally agree to cave to U.S. pressure. Thus, changing EU law and policy to satisfy Trump and to ensure continued U.S. security commitment would be structurally very difficult for the European Union to pull off, even if many, if not most member states, wanted to strike such a deal. France in particular will seize on efforts to hold European security hostage for policy concessions as unacceptable, and it will likely push back against the efforts of other member states to pressure the European Commission to soften its approach or change policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Europe’s perceived weakness will likely lead the Trump administration to underestimate Europe. On the one hand, the clash with the United States comes at a terrible time for Europe. There is political disarray in France and Germany. European unity is plagued by internal Trojan horse states, like Hungary and Slovakia, that block European unity. Europe is plagued by economic frailty and stagnation. The continent is at its most insecure since the Cold War, and it is as dependent as ever on the United States both for its security and its energy supply. And yet, Europe’s weakness is also vastly overstated, especially by Europeans. Europe has shown again and again its strength in unity when facing direct challenges to its union, exemplified by its response to Brexit. Brussels is largely empowered to act, and Europeans have shown a willingness to do whatever it takes to protect themselves in crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is hard to see a grand bargain happening in the immediate term. Instead, it looks likely that there will be major policy collisions in many different sectors. These collisions may be bruising. Some may become all-encompassing fights, while others may simmer but never fully come to a boil. Instead of a grand bargain, a more hopeful path may be that a détente is eventually reached in which both sides essentially agree to tolerate each other. The challenge for transatlantic relations is to navigate these coming collisions without truly upending the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clashes-everywhere-all-at-once&quot;&gt;Clashes Everywhere, All at Once&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NATO and European Defense: Burden-Shifting, For Real This Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe will try desperately to maintain the status quo on defense with the United States, ensuring European security and staying engaged in NATO. The problem for Europe is that the Trump administration appears intent on shifting responsibility for European security to Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s talk of annexing Greenland from Denmark also raised fundamental concerns about the U.S. commitment to NATO. If the United States is seeking to take an ally’s territory, it is hard to see it coming to defend an ally’s territory. At his first NATO Defense Ministerial, Secretary of Defense Hegseth said, “the United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency. Rather, our relationship will prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This represents a radical shift in the United States’ foreign policy toward Europe. Since the 1950s, the United States has sought to play an indispensable role in European security. As much as U.S. administrations have complained about the lack of European defense spending and Europe’s limited defense capabilities, the United States has not supported Europe working to organize itself militarily without the United States (this has particularly been the case since the end of the Cold War, when the United States aggressively opposed such self-organization). The United States, across administrations, has been strongly opposed to the European Union’s involvement in defense. European dependence on the United States has been seen as a feature, not a bug, of the current structure of NATO, giving the United States a set of ready-made partners and unparalleled influence in a large, wealthy, and technologically advanced region. Yet President Trump has shown little affinity toward NATO and has repeatedly questioned its value. A new generation of defense and foreign policy thinkers in Republican foreign policy see the United States as overstretched and emphasize the need to ruthlessly prioritize Asia over Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump has recently demanded that European countries spend 5 percent of GDP on defense, which is much more than what the United States spends and a significant increase from what anyone has been calling for; it is also almost certainly unachievable for almost all NATO countries. Trump, in short, is laying out a demand that he knows will not be met and that lays the groundwork for the United States to pull back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question now is whether and in which form that transition comes about. It is highly likely that the Trump administration will reduce U.S. force presence in Europe, with some reports of 20,000 forces being withdrawn. In a report titled the The Prioritization Imperative, Heritage Foundation Research Fellow Robert Peters and former Heritage Foundation scholar and current Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Alex Velez-Green wrote that the items to be transferred “will likely include submarines and surface combatants; heavy bombers; fighter, electronic attack, maritime patrol, and airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;amp;C) aircraft; air and missile defenses; certain ground-based long-range fires; critical munitions for air, naval, and ground platforms; and critical enablers, such as airlift, sealift, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets.” Such a shift will create enormous gaps in European defense. A U.S. pullback and a move toward making the U.S. position in NATO essentially “dormant,” as conservative scholar Sumantra Maitra notably called for, looks quite possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should the United States pull back, Europe will have to take urgent and ambitious steps. It will require not just significant fiscal outlays but massive internal reforms to ensure that Europeans can fight together. However, should Europe take these steps and effectively “get their act together,” the result will not be a more supplicant European Commission looking to make concessions but exactly the opposite. A U.S. pullback from European security will make clashes in other policy areas more intense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukraine-as-europes-problem&quot;&gt;Ukraine as Europe’s Problem?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump has called for a negotiated end to the war in Ukraine. Yet there is significant uncertainty not only about whether such a deal can be reached, but also about the U.S. commitment to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a comprehensive peace settlement somewhat unlikely is that Russia presently has the military advantage, as the future of U.S. military support is now uncertain and as the Biden administration allocated almost all of the funding from the April 2024 supplemental appropriation. While the Trump administration has the leverage to push Ukraine to the negotiating table, it is not clear by any means that it can bring Russia to the table without making concessions that either Ukraine finds unacceptable or that fundamentally alter European security. It seems likely that whether talks succeed or fail, the financial costs of both rebuilding and, vitally, rearming Ukraine are likely to be seen as a European responsibility by the Trump administration. The problem for Ukraine is that Europe simply lacks the military materiel and the defense industrial capacity to match U.S. aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may force Europe to effectively procure U.S. military equipment, such as 155 mm ammunition from the United States, for Ukraine. Europe may do whatever it takes to ensure Ukraine doesn’t lose. Yet it will certainly resent having to buy U.S. aid, adding to the sense of abandonment and angst toward the United States. Thus, there is a distinct prospect for Europe that it will not only have to scramble to support Ukraine, but that it will also need to scramble to deal with a potential withdrawal of U.S. forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more problematic for Europe (and Ukraine) is the potential for the United States to enter direct negotiations with Russia about the future of European security over their heads. There are fears in Europe of a “Yalta II” scenario, echoing the 1945 conference in which the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union carved up the future of post–World War II Eastern Europe. This will add to a deep sense of distrust toward Washington, all of which will likely lead to more tension in other policy areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-eu-trade-war-20-pain-both-ways&quot;&gt;U.S.-EU Trade War 2.0: Pain Both Ways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-EU trade relationship is one of the most important in the history of the world. The European economy is massive—with 450 million mostly wealthy consumers, its economy is roughly equivalent in size to the economies of the United States and China. Trump’s proposed trade agenda, with upward of 20 percent tariffs, will hurt the European economy, which is even more dependent on the U.S. market for exports as China is squeezing out European products. Almost 20 percent of EU exports went to the United States in 2023. Thus, the European Union fears getting squeezed by both of its export markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 7, President Trump announced plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on U.S. imports equal to the rates that trading partners impose on U.S. exports. While details of the proposal remain unclear, the announcement will surely raise concerns in Europe about an imminent trade war with the United States. The February 7 announcement follows late January comments in which Trump said that he would “absolutely” levy tariffs on the European Union, citing Brussels’ action against U.S. tech companies and its large trade deficit in goods. On February 9, President Trump announced that he would impose 25 percent tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum on February 10, with reciprocal tariffs on all products to follow on February 11. While European steel and aluminum exports to the United States are relatively limited, the tariffs will likely trigger a forceful response from Brussels, with the European Commission already labeling them as them as “unlawful” and “counterproductive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union would prefer to avoid a trade war, and it has offered certain concessions. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has suggested that the European Union could buy more U.S. LNG as part of a broader trade deal with Washington. The head of the European Parliament’s trade committee suggested that the European Union could reduce its 10 percent import tax on cars, aligning it more closely with the 2.5 percent charged by the United States. Yet it is unclear what to offer, since it is unclear what President Trump is after besides a general rebalancing of trade. In addition, the euro has depreciated roughly 5 percent since November 5, which makes EU exports to the United States 5 percent more competitive and may soften the short-term blow of any aggressive U.S. measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, trade is a policy area where the European Union has the power and the ability to act. The European Union does not need unanimous support from member states to act, and the European Commission is largely empowered to retaliate. A dedicated task force within the European Commission has spent the past year preparing for potential trade spats with the United States. Brussels will already have a list of U.S. products that could be targeted for retaliation, likely predominantly goods produced in Republican states, as well as symbolic goods like bourbon and Harley Davidson motorcycles. The European Union could thus reimpose tariffs on U.S. imports that were suspended under the deal that ended the 2018 dispute with the first Trump administration. Without action, these suspended tariffs are already scheduled to enter into force in March 2025, and they will target products such as orange juice, peanut butter, Harley Davidsons, and bourbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union can also survive a bruising trade war with the United States, as it is much less exposed to the U.S. market than Canada or Mexico. Martin Sandbu of the Financial Times assessed that for Germany and Italy, “if all their exports to the US were halted in a trade war, about 3 per cent of GDP would disappear directly . . . comparable to a bad recession and milder than the Covid-19 shock. And that is a worst-case scenario.” In short, a trade war to the death with the United States would be more costly for the European Union than the United States, but both would experience negative economic effects. Meanwhile, Europe’s politicians would be bolstered politically because it was the United States that started the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union also has a new tool, the Anti-Coercion-Instrument (ACI), described as the union’s retaliatory “bazooka.” This is a new tool that the European Union has never used. The idea for the instrument emerged during the Trump administration but was only fully developed in response to China’s targeting of the Lithuanian economy following its increased diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. The tool is intended to enable the European Union to respond to a country that is targeting a member state and therefore seeking to undermine the single market. The instrument enables the European Union to apply a wide range of retaliatory measures, including revoking intellectual property rights that could be particularly harmful to U.S. tech companies in Europe. It also enables the European Union to block foreign direct investment and restrict access to banking, insurance, and other financial services. With regard to timing, the instrument was partly designed to allow for a swift response to economic coercion and will likely be applied expeditiously. However, it may take many months for an investigation to be concluded and for the European Council to determine the existence of economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an escalating trade war, the European Union will also try to counter the United States by forging a common front with other U.S. allies and G-7 members. On February 12, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was in Brussels to meet with the European Union, where trade tensions with the United States were no doubt discussed. The European Union will also seek to coordinate with other U.S. allies, such as Australia, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential for a transatlantic trade war to cause major economic fallout, as well as the European Union’s reasonably strong ability to fight such a war and link it to other policy areas, such as technology companies through the ACI, will likely create incentives on both sides not to let a trade war spiral out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technology-regulations-the-coming-us-eu-techpocalypse&quot;&gt;Technology Regulations: The Coming U.S.-EU Techpocalypse?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology regulations may well be the policy area where collision becomes most politically intense. U.S. technology companies have long opposed European technology regulations. Yet the depth of hostility and concern on both sides of the Atlantic since Trump’s election has been revealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the election of Donald Trump, U.S. tech companies see a huge opportunity for the United States to assert maximum pressure on the European Union to drop its approach toward tech regulation. They, much like U.S. companies in other sectors, see Europe’s military dependence as potential leverage vis-à-vis the European Union. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg asserted that EU competition rules were “almost like a tariff” and that “If some other country was screwing with another industry that we cared about, the U.S. government would probably find some way to put pressure on them.” Marc Andreessen, cofounder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and an influential Trump donor, told Ross Douthat in a New York Times podcast that “we face enormous challenges in Europe. Enormous challenges even in the U.K. There’s just these extremely draconian anti-tech, anti-business, anti-American policies . . . what they’re also doing is damaging our companies. And so we would like to work with the administration to help global markets open up and for American companies to win.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many respects, U.S. tech companies are fighting so hard not because they can walk away from their second-largest market—a market roughly the size of the United States—but because they can’t. What they are extremely nervous about is the so-called Brussels effect—whereby EU regulations in fact set global market standards due to the European Union’s market size and pave the way for others around the world (Brazil, India, etc.) to emulate the EU rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet U.S. pressure may backfire and in fact put U.S. tech companies more in the firing line. A Financial Times report, for instance, highlighted the ability of the European Union to suspend intellectual property rights in the European Union for U.S. tech companies as part of the ACI to respond to U.S. tariffs or threats against Greenland. The maximum pressure campaign on tech regulations, coupled with ignoring EU laws (essentially daring the European Union to respond, as X seems to be doing), is unlikely to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has initially responded gingerly to statements from the Trump administration. The union, for instance, dropped it AI liability proposal, following Vice President Vance’s speech in Paris, which attacked EU technology regulation. Yet the clashes in the above areas will likely stiffen the commission’s spine. There are also several reasons why the European Union will find it incredibly difficult to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, by elevating the publicity around the clash, U.S. tech companies are threatening the very credibility of the European Union, which the union will likely doggedly defend. The European Union is almost certainly not going to back down and may accelerate its enforcement of its tech laws. Furthermore, should the European Union fail to implement its laws, EU citizens can take the union to the European Court of Justice, the EU supreme court, potentially forcing greater enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Europe may have little to lose economically (and perhaps more to gain) by vigorous enforcement of its regulations vis-à-vis U.S. companies, particularly relating to social media. There are many reasons why U.S. technology companies have been successful in Europe and have gained dominant market positions. But the European Union may also see economic advantages in disrupting those positions and creating space for EU, or at least EU-compliant, companies to gain market share. It is not as if entrepreneurs in the European Union are technologically incapable of building rival platforms, but they struggle to dislodge the existing companies and gain scale. When China and Russia banned U.S. platforms, they created their own equivalent technology companies. While there are many things the European Union needs to do facilitate innovation, such as improving access to capital, pushing U.S. companies out of the European market could create a vacuum for European tech companies to gain European scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, and perhaps most importantly, Europeans believe that the health of their democracy is at stake. The critical question for the European Union is whether it wants its tech, and particularly its social media sector, to look like that of the United States. A clash over Elon Musk’s X seems imminent. Since the election, Musk has bluntly inserted himself into European politics. He is publicly backing the far-right AfD in the German elections and gave the AfD’s lead candidate a high-profile interview. He has also gone after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and promised to invest significantly to support the far-right reform party. Mark Zuckerberg has also changed Meta’s and Facebook’s content moderation policies in the United States, which may impact the European Union as well. Meanwhile, the European Union’s Digital Services Act is law and all but requires the union to act against X, given the utter lack of content moderation and other failings by X to meet the regulatory standards. Now former EU Commissioner Thierry Bretton has published a letter warning of X’s “due diligence obligations set out in the Digital Services Act.” The transition to a new EU Commission has temporarily put the issue on ice, but once the new EU Commission is in place, the European Union will have to respond to X’s flagrant disregard for EU law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the U.S. banning of TikTok, as well as the emergence of rivals to X following Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter, may reduce the fears of EU decisionmakers about disrupting the social media marketplace. Furthermore, while U.S. officials and executives decry Europe’s lack of innovation, Europeans may similarly see the United States’ virtually unregulated online media environment as politically and socially corrosive. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, for instance, said that social media companies “were poisoning society.” He continued: “Let’s take back control. Let’s make social media great again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe is thus unlikely to back down to U.S. pressure on tech regulations and it may very well take stronger action as a result, as this is an area where it has considerable leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;energy-and-climate-on-different-planets&quot;&gt;Energy and Climate: On Different Planets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transatlantic clashes over climate policy and regulations will also be tumultuous. The European Union, having passed the Green Deal under the previous European Commission, is now set to implement various regulations and provisions that will likely provoke strong reactions from the Trump administration and U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union will begin implementing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which is essentially a carbon tariff, in 2026. Navigating this would have been challenging under a Harris administration, since the United States lacks any carbon pricing mechanism. But because the United States was taking climate action through the Inflation Reduction Act and other regulatory means, the prevailing mood was that the United States and the European Union could come to an understanding. However, the Trump administration’s rollback of renewable energy incentives and environmental regulations means that carbon-intensive industries that export to the European Union will likely be affected by the tariff. Thus, even if there is a tariff détente reached in 2025 on other issues, CBAM implementation could trigger another conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other provisions of the Green Deal, such as REPowerEU, the Green Deal Industrial Plan, the Regulation on Deforestation-free Products, and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), which targets oil and gas companies and essentially enables EU citizens to engage in lawfare against fossil fuel companies, will spur clashes. Green policies have spurred backlash within Europe, and perhaps there would be openness to compromise or watering down some of these regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the United States turning away from climate action, such as by pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords, will stoke intense anti-Americanism within Europe, especially among younger post–Cold War Europeans. European attitudes toward China may also soften given the bold steps China is taking on climate, creating a major opportunity for China to wedge European public opinion in its favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-familiar-fight-the-rules-based-liberal-international-order&quot;&gt;The Familiar Fight: The “Rules-Based Liberal International Order”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe and the United States under Trump have different outlooks toward the world and different approaches to international affairs, which will serve to exacerbate tensions. For instance, the concept of a rules-based liberal international order is largely dismissed by many in the Trump administration yet remains foundational to Europe’s geopolitical outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s rhetoric about annexing Gaza for the United States and preventing Palestinians from returning was met with condemnation in Europe. Moreover, the president’s efforts to bring Greenland and the Panama Canal under U.S. control have similarly led to concerns in Europe about the United States undermining the post–World War II international consensus against the forceful or coercive changing of borders. Should the Trump administration pursue these efforts, it will inevitably lead to a diplomatic clash with Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s decision to sanction the International Criminal Court (ICC) has also been condemned by many EU countries. The European Union and European states are seeking to protect the ICC and maintain its international standing. European Commissioner for Democracy, Justice, the Rule of Law and Consumer Protection Michael McGrath pledged that the European Union will continue “to use the tools at . . . [its] disposal to protect the ICC.” This will likely be an area where there is a continuously simmering opposition to the Trump administration. The United States may make Europe a potential target of future secondary sanctions, similar to during Trump’s first term, when the United States pulled out of a nuclear agreement with Iran while Europe remained a party to it and became the target of secondary sanctions from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the administration’s withdrawal from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Accords marks a stark contrast with Europe. These withdrawals sets up a familiar clash between Europe and U.S. Republican administrations, where the United States slams UN and other multilateral structures, while the European Union seeks to uphold and protect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the abrupt shutdown of USAID, as well as the pullback of the United States from climate financing agreements with countries like South Africa and Indonesia, will put more of an onus on Europe. The European Union and its member states are already the largest foreign aid donors in the world. Yet there are fears that the ending of U.S. aid to places like the Horn of Africa could create instability and refugee flows. Thus, with the United States’ retreat there is more financial burden placed on Europe to support development, civil society, and democracy initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china-renewed-transatlantic-divergence&quot;&gt;China: Renewed Transatlantic Divergence?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the first Trump administration, there was a growing schism between the United States and Europe over China. The Trump administration, understandably concerned about the increasing presence of the Chinese company Huawei in the digital infrastructure of its European allies, insisted that Europe stop incorporating Huawei into Europe’s networks. In December 2020, the European Union, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, negotiated a trade and investment agreement with China that was designed to bring Europe and China closer together economically. Yet the Biden administration made a concerted effort to increasingly align transatlantic approaches toward China. This led to a significant narrowing of the differences between the United States and Europe regarding China, with Europe largely adopting a much more hawkish tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this was due to China’s actions, such as its support of Russia’s war machine in Ukraine, and there are clear economic reasons for the Europeans to adopt a firm approach toward China. Yet the tensions that emerge in transatlantic relations in the aforementioned policy areas may also weaken transatlantic unity with regard to China policy. Europe has often seen the United States as unnecessarily hawkish on China, provoking tensions, such as with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s 2022 visit to Taiwan. Thus, Europe may resist hawkish approaches toward China from the Trump administration. They may also see opportunities to cooperate with Beijing on global climate action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economically, Europe and China, both export-focused economies, are in firm competition with each other. Both China and Europe strive to be global leaders in the clean technology sector, for instance, and Chinese overproduction is threatening European industrial champions, particularly in the auto sector. Nevertheless, China may offer market access opportunities that may entice Europe to soften its approach toward Beijing. Europe’s instinct may become more skeptical of alignment with the United States on China policy, which in turn may lead to more tension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the policy areas examined in this report could become a major source of tension. They each could spiral out of control and cause deep, perhaps irrevocable risks to the future of the transatlantic alliance. Policymakers on both sides will need to be cognizant of the risks and the potential harm that such clashes can cause. As such, the United States should not assume European weakness, and Brussels should not assume the worst from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s efforts to fundamentally alter the transatlantic relationship and shift the burden of European security to Europe should not have to mean the end of the alliance. Europe will need to act. But the Trump administration should also realize that upending the alliance while also escalating fights in other policy areas such as trade, tech, and climate, or imposing secondary sanctions on Europeans, may cause major blowback in each of those policy areas and, most importantly, irrevocably rupture the alliance. Collisions are inevitably coming, but both sides should proceed with care.&lt;/p&gt;

As China pushes forward with its latest LLM, Europe faces tough questions on innovation, competition, and digital sovereignty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 20, 2025, Chinese AI company DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model, causing U.S. policymakers and technologists to dramatically reevaluate their assumptions about the state of the Chinese AI ecosystem. President Donald Trump noted, “The release . . . should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win, because we have the greatest scientists in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R1, and the DeepSeek V3 model it was based on, demonstrates an innovative approach to AI model development in several important ways, primarily in cost and compute efficiency. This did not come without controversies. White House AI Czar David Sacks said there is “substantial evidence” that DeepSeek distilled knowledge out of OpenAI’s models. Meanwhile, OpenAI alleged that DeepSeek’s use of data distilled from OpenAI’s models in training R1 broke OpenAI’s terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controversy was not limited to the United States, however. European regulators have greeted DeepSeek’s rise with concern, even as leading European AI companies have expressed excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;positive-news-for-european-startups---&quot;&gt;Positive News for European Startups . . .&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European startups have hailed R1 as a major advancement and opportunity, as it hints at the possibility for EU startups to successfully compete despite disadvantages (compared with U.S. firms), such as the lack of capital and limited access to large-scale compute infrastructure. French AI champion Mistral AI has been particularly enthusiastic about R1’s release, claiming that it proves the viability of an emerging wave of mini-language models (using far fewer parameters and running on far less compute).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 30, Mistral announced its latest AI model, praising R1 in the press release as a “a great and complementary piece of open-source technology!” Mistral’s CEO Arthur Mensch went even further in an interview on February 10, calling DeepSeek “a player that is very similar to us” and saying it is “China’s Mistral.” Companies do not normally compliment their ostensible competitors when announcing new products. That Mistral chose to do so highlights just how much they believe DeepSeek has changed the game, even though in the same interview Mensch also stated that DeepSeek “made extensive use of the technologies we made available in 2023.” The German AI champion, Aleph Alpha, already dropped out of the model-developing race a while ago, but it quickly began offering DeepSeek models as part of its portfolio of business-focused AI services. Whereas Mistral evidently sought to ride the DeepSeek hype wave, even claiming its innovations originate from Mistral’s ones, Aleph Alpha saw DeepSeek as a technology enabler. Even as recently as a month ago, few would have expected EU firms to talk about Chinese AI model developers in such terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;---but-cause-for-concern-among-european-regulators&quot;&gt;. . . But Cause for Concern Among European Regulators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European regulators disagree. DeepSeek made itself freely available both to download and to use as an online app in the European marketplace. For an AI model, this is not inherently problematic, but there are specific features of DeepSeek’s models that likely run afoul of EU regulations, in particular with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the key law covering privacy in Europe, and the EU AI Act, which covers AI safety and security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;privacy-concerns&quot;&gt;Privacy Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R1’s privacy policy is clearly not compliant with GDPR. It is not by chance that several national data protection authorities (like those of Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and the Netherlands) immediately sent official requests for information to DeepSeek. Italy went even further, blocking access to the app only days after it came out. Italian privacy authorities judged the information DeepSeek submitted to be “totally insufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, DeepSeek’s privacy policy openly states that users’ data will be stored in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), fails to even mention GDPR, and states that the jurisdiction for personal data processing is the PRC. Each of these elements can be construed as in breach of the European Union’s strict data protection rules, given the model is made widely accessible in the European Union. Humorously, when prompted to assess its own privacy policy for GDPR compliance, the R1 model stated flatly that it had several gaps (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IqWDpu5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: DeepSeek’s Response to a User Question About GDPR Compliance.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michael-van-den-poel_talk-of-the-brussels-town-today-deepseek-activity-7290006543016558593-A-bK?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&quot;&gt;Michaël Van den Poel, LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These gaps, if not addressed, could very well lead to a broader restriction of DeepSeek across Europe in the near future. Such a restriction would presumably apply regardless of who is providing access to DeepSeek’s model. For example, Microsoft, which has begun offering access to DeepSeek in its Azure cloud environment, will likely be affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;safety-and-security-concerns&quot;&gt;Safety and Security Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDPR is already having an impact on DeepSeek, but whether the EU AI Act will do the same remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early red-teaming tests performed on R1 by Enkrypt AI, an American AI firm focused on AI security and compliance, suggest that the model lacks even basic safety and security measures and is prone to generate biased, violent, and abusive content, as well as insecure code. In particular, Enkrypt found that DeepSeek R1 is 11 times more vulnerable to producing harmful content and 4.5 times more vulnerable to generating insecure code than OpenAI’s o1. Similar results were confirmed by other testers, including Adversa and Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this background, European officials told CSIS that regulators are concerned that the success of DeepSeek could create a race to the bottom by incentivizing companies to cut corners on basic safety and security guardrails in order to release similar “mini-models” as fast as possible. An additional source of concern is the possibility that the Chinese government might leverage R1 for surveillance or military applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU AI Act will apply to general-purpose AI (GPAI) models beginning in August 2025. By that time, all GPAI models placed on the EU market will have to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;draw up detailed technical documentation,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;put in place a copyright policy, and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;publish a sufficiently detailed summary of copyrighted content used to train the model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Models released under an open-source license will escape the technical documentation obligations, but not the copyright ones. Whether or not R1 would legally qualify as an open-source model will be discussed later in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, models reaching the threshold of 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; floating point operations (FLOPs) (whether open source or not) will have to comply with further obligations, namely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;model evaluation,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;risk assessment and mitigation,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;incident reporting, and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;cybersecurity measures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not these rules will apply to models such as R1 remains to be seen and is likely to become one of the first key interpretative decisions of the European Union’s AI Office regarding the act’s implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-deepseek-r1-considered-open-source-under-the-eu-ai-act&quot;&gt;Is DeepSeek R1 Considered Open Source Under the EU AI Act?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the EU AI Act exempts open-source model providers from transparency obligations, it is important to assess whether or not DeepSeek R1 can be considered open source within the meaning of the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text of the act does not contain a definition of open source. It merely states that providers will enjoy different and reduced regulatory obligations if their AI models “are released under a free and open-source licence that allows for the access, usage, modification, and distribution of the model, and whose parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage, are made publicly available.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging from the license and the information DeepSeek has made available, these criteria all seem to be met. However, while the above is the formal law statement on what constitutes open-source AI, the AI Act includes additional text, called recitals, which do not have the same legal standing as the law’s articles but are critical clarifying statements of how the law will be implemented. The relevant recital on what qualifies as open source states that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this Regulation, AI components that are provided against a price or otherwise monetised, including through the provision of technical support . . . or the use of personal data for reasons other than exclusively for improving the security, compatibility or interoperability of the software . . . should not benefit from the exceptions provided to free and open-source AI components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The non-monetization element is the one that appears to be missing in the case of DeepSeek, in particular because of the use of personal data. As explained above, DeepSeek’s privacy policy is problematic under GDPR. In DeepSeek’s policy, in the section “How We Use Your Information,” the last point states that DeepSeek will use the personal data to “comply with our legal obligations, or as necessary to perform tasks in the public interest, or to protect the vital interests of our users and other people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without even going into details on what complying with legal obligations or performing tasks in the public interest could mean for a Chinese company, this point alone seems to go beyond using personal data exclusively for improving the security, compatibility, or interoperability of the software. Therefore, depending on how much weight the AI Office will give to elements written in the explanatory recitals of the regulation (that are not directly enforceable), it is also possible that DeepSeek will not be considered as meeting the open-source criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;does-r1s-use-of-distillation-techniques-fall-under-the-eu-ai-acts-measures-around-fine-tuning&quot;&gt;Does R1’s Use of Distillation Techniques Fall Under the EU AI Act’s Measures Around “Fine-Tuning?”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crux of the whole question revolves around the problem of defining what R1, which DeepSeek serves through its app and other channels, actually is. As mentioned above, OpenAI and prominent White House representatives have alleged that DeepSeek likely employed distillation of OpenAI models to help achieve R1’s impressive results. In the words of Microsoft engineers Vishal Yadav and Nikhil Pandey, distillation is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a technique designed to transfer knowledge of a large pre-trained model (the “teacher”) into a smaller model (the “student”), enabling the student model to achieve comparable performance to the teacher model. This technique allows users to leverage the high quality of larger LLMs, while reducing inference costs in a production environment, thanks to the smaller student model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, researchers analyzing R1 seem to indicate that the concept of distillation does not exactly apply in this case, or applies only in part. Indeed, R1 is the result of pure reinforcement learning applied to an already capable model (in this case, DeepSeek’s V3) combined with further training stages using different methods to refine the model and make it more readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Office is working on guidelines around the issue of fine-tuning to clarify how the AI Act’s provisions can apply to downstream model providers. The direction of these guidelines will determine the different scenarios that are further explored in this article and depicted in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SWr9Nrm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Key Legal Questions for DeepSeek’s R1 Under the EU AI Act.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Parliament and European Council sources told CSIS that when writing the AI Act, their intention was that fine-tuning a model would not immediately trigger regulatory obligations. Indeed, the rules for GPAI models are intended to ideally apply only to the upstream model, the baseline one from which all the different applications in the AI value chain originate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the AI Act would trigger for fine-tuning are mere “value-chain” provisions. That is, the fine-tuner just needs to augment the information already provided by the upstream model provider with any changes made. As an example, if a law firm fine-tunes GPT-4 by training it with thousands of case laws and legal briefs to build its own specialized “lawyer-friendly” application, it would not need to draw up a whole set of detailed technical documentation, its own copyright policy, and a summary of copyrighted data. Instead, the law firm in question would only need to indicate on the existing documentation the process it used to fine-tune GPT-4 and the datasets it used (in this example, the one containing the thousands of case laws and legal briefs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-1-does-r1-amount-to-fine-tuning&quot;&gt;Step 1: Does R1 Amount to Fine-Tuning?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the AI Office confirms that distillation is a form of fine-tuning, especially if the AI Office concludes that R1’s other various training techniques all fall within the realm of “fine-tuning,” then DeepSeek would only have to complete the information to pass along the value chain, just as the law firm did. The information and research papers that DeepSeek released already seem to comply with this measure (though the data would be incomplete if OpenAI’s claims are true).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if the guidelines indicate that the combination of distillation and the other refining techniques used for R1 are so sophisticated that they created a new model in its own right, then the provisions of the AI Act for GPAI models will apply to it starting August 2, 2025. To be more precise, the AI Act states that GPAI models already placed on the market before that date must “take the necessary steps in order to comply with the obligations by 2 August 2027,” or in two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-2-if-r1-is-a-new-model-can-it-be-designated-as-a-gpai-model-with-systemic-risk&quot;&gt;Step 2: If R1 Is a New Model, Can It Be Designated as a GPAI Model with Systemic Risk?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, EU regulators will have to take another step to decide exactly what provisions R1 should comply with. Since R1’s size is well below the EU AI Act threshold of 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; FLOPs, they could conclude that DeepSeek need only comply with baseline provisions for all GPAI models, that is, technical documentation and copyright provisions (see above). If DeepSeek’s models are considered open source through the interpretation described above, the regulators could conclude that it would largely be exempted from most of these measures, except for the copyright ones. As explained above, this remains to be clarified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, there is still a possibility that the AI Office designates R1 as a GPAI model with systemic risk even though it sits well below the 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; FLOPs threshold that would normally trigger the designation. The AI Act indeed foresees the possibility of a GPAI model below that compute threshold to be designated as a model with systemic risk anyway, in presence of a combination of other criteria (e.g., number of parameters, size of the data set, and number of registered business users).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this designation occurs, then DeepSeek would have to put in place adequate model evaluation, risk assessment, and mitigation measures, as well as cybersecurity measures. It could not escape these through the open-source exemption, as this does not apply to models with systemic risk. Failure to comply would likely result in fines up to 3 percent of DeepSeek’s annual turnover (a figure that is usually similar to annual revenue) or being restricted from the EU single market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operationalization of the rules on GPAI models is currently being drafted within the so-called Code of Practice. Because DeepSeek is not a participant to the drafting of the code, U.S. AI companies have a great opportunity to continue to constructively engage in the drafting process, as doing so will allow them to shape the rules that DeepSeek will have to follow a few months from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deepseek-new-concern-or-opportunity-for-europe-the-different-scenarios&quot;&gt;DeepSeek: New Concern or Opportunity for Europe? The Different Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Office will have to tread very carefully with the fine-tuning guidelines and the possible designation of DeepSeek R1 as a GPAI model with systemic risk. On the one hand, DeepSeek and its further replications or similar mini-models have shown European companies that it is entirely possible to compete with, and possibly outperform, the most advanced large-scale models using much less compute and at a fraction of the cost. This could open a whole new array of attractive opportunities. The AI Office will need to navigate the trade-off between securing robust guardrails and the need to boost the lagging European AI ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-1-r1-is-considered-mere-fine-tuning&quot;&gt;Scenario 1: R1 Is Considered Mere Fine-Tuning.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, as described above, R1 is considered fine-tuning, European companies reproducing similar models with similar techniques will virtually escape almost all AI Act provisions. This could potentially open the way to hundreds of startups quickly becoming competitive with U.S. giants such as OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic, which will instead have to comply with the highest tier of GPAI obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, DeepSeek’s R1 and similar models across the world will themselves escape the rules, with only GDPR left to protect EU citizens from harmful practices. Nevertheless, GDPR might by itself result in an EU-wide restriction of access to R1. This would provide EU companies with even more space to compete, as they are better suited to navigate the bloc’s privacy and security rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This overall scenario could sit well with the clear shift in focus toward competitiveness under the new EU legislative term, which runs from 2024 to 2029. The European Commission released a Competitiveness Compass on January 29, a roadmap detailing its approach to innovation. The document foresees a key role for AI in boosting the European Union’s industry, and it lists several upcoming policy and legislative initiatives in this regard. In the words of EU Commissioner for Tech Sovereignty Henna Virkkunen, “the EU must become a true AI continent.” This scenario is therefore possibly the most desirable for EU companies, though perhaps the least desirable for U.S. ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-2-r1-is-considered-to-be-a-gpai-model&quot;&gt;Scenario 2: R1 Is Considered to Be a GPAI Model.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If R1 is considered to be a GPAI model in its own right (triggering the basic tier of obligations), and possibly a GPAI model with systemic risk, it will have to comply with the highest set of requirements of the AI Act for GPAI models. Similar models can still flourish in Europe, but they will also have to follow the AI Act’s rules, at the very least on transparency and copyright. Furthermore, if R1 is designated as a model with systemic risk, the possibility to replicate similar results in multiple new models in Europe could result in a flourishing of models with systemic risk. This scenario was not foreseen by the European co-legislators when the AI Act was negotiated, as the assumption always was that the top-tier would only be represented by a handful of providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, this scenario would possibly be the most beneficial for U.S. companies, which would still be competitive and be on a level-playing field with both DeepSeek’s R1 and EU companies. They would also have the additional advantage of participating in the ongoing drafting of the Code of Practice detailing how to comply with the AI Act’s requirements for models. The European Union’s Mistral AI would similarly benefit from a first-mover advantage, but not the many EU startups that could further build on these innovations, as they are mainly not directly part to the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novelty introduced by R1 creates both new concerns and incredible opportunities for Europe in the AI space. While it is unclear yet whether and to what extent the EU AI Act will apply to it, it still poses a lot of privacy, safety, and security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the safety and security issues, Europe’s best option is to designate R1 as a GPAI model in its own right, as described above in Scenario 2. This would ensure that similar mini-models that employ different refining techniques could also fall within the AI Act’s rules, at the very least on transparency and copyright. European companies already have to comply with the GDPR and usually integrate responsible AI governance practices and safety measures in their AI products. Complying with transparency and copyright rules should not pose too big of an additional hurdle for them. The cost and compute efficiencies that R1 has shown present opportunities for European AI companies to be much more competitive than seemed possible a year ago, perhaps even more competitive than R1 itself in the EU market. EU models might indeed be not only as efficient and accurate as R1, but also more trusted by consumers on issues of privacy, safety, and security. This might be the best of both worlds, but European officials and companies will have to navigate a complex road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Morocco has emerged as a key player in supporting stability in the Sahel, leveraging its strategic position, deep historical ties, and economic and infrastructure development partnerships to promote cross-border security cooperation. In December 2024, RUSI convened a roundtable discussion to explore “The Geopolitics of the Sahel: Transnational Threats, Security and Stability”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sahel has emerged as a critical geopolitical region where the UK and its allies face consequential policy decisions related to security, stability, cross-border organised crime, terrorism, illegal migration and illicit finance. Similarly, Morocco’s policy priorities and national security are deeply connected to, and influenced by, developments in the Sahel. As a historical bridge between North and West Africa, Morocco is uniquely positioned to act as a stabilising force, using a mix of diplomatic, economic and security tools to support sustainable development and security in the Sahel. Rabat has taken a number of strategic steps to emerge as a key security partner to the UK and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most ambitious steps taken by Rabat is the recent Morocco Atlantic Initiative, which aims to provide landlocked Sahel countries with access to vital maritime trade routes via Morocco’s Atlantic port infrastructure. The plan aims to foster economic regional integration to reduce dependence on unstable transit routes, while fostering Morocco’s ties with its southern neighbours to counter instability, terrorism and illicit trafficking in the region in the long term. Economic integration and stability would align with the UK’s interest in promoting stability and security for the region’s peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morocco’s engagement with the Sahel is also deeply embedded in broader geo-economic partnerships to strengthen regional integration, such as the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline, which aims to connect West African energy resources to North Africa and Europe. While there are many security, political and diplomatic challenges facing the region, Morocco’s investments in infrastructure, banking and telecommunications illustrate its commitment to economic interdependence to counter extremism and promote sustainable partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;beatriz-de-león-cobo&quot;&gt;Beatriz de León Cobo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sahel region of Africa continues to face urgent security challenges, with far-reaching consequences for both the continent and its international partners. Stretching across the expanse of West Africa from Senegal to Sudan, the Sahel has long been susceptible to threats such as terrorism, insurgency, illicit trafficking, and governance crises. Over the past decade, the region has experienced a significant surge in jihadist violence, mostly carried out by groups affiliated with al-Qa’ida and Islamic State. These armed actors take advantage of porous borders, fragile states, and local grievances to extend their operational reach. This article will focus on the central Sahel region and its bordering areas in the Maghreb and West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, a year on from the initial announcement of their intention to do so, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger officially withdrew from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). These three countries, all members of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), continued to deepen their integration while leaving the West African community. Originally formed to address common security threats, the AES soon evolved into a platform for these governments to assert a new vision of sovereignty and partnership. This departure marks a major upheaval in the regional architecture, affecting trade, freedom of movement, and collective security frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During an ECOWAS summit in Abuja, the three AES states formally rejected a proposal to delay their departure by six months, opting instead for a more immediate exit, despite intense diplomatic efforts by President Bassirou Diomaye Faye of Senegal and President Faure Gnassingbé of Togo. In response to the withdrawal, ECOWAS indicated it would maintain a “status quo” while organising exit talks with the AES. A statement released on 29 January 2025 confirmed that AES citizens holding ECOWAS-issued documents would retain recognition of their passports and identification cards until further notice. Goods and services originating from Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger would also remain subject to ECOWAS trade policies for the time being. According to ECOWAS officials, these steps aim to prevent abrupt disruptions, mitigate economic fallout, and keep dialogue channels open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Access to Morocco’s ports for Sahel countries offers a critical corridor to global markets, reducing their reliance on other neighbours&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the long-term outcome remains uncertain. Negotiators suggest transitional arrangements may include a grace period, followed by bilateral accords to address specific security and trade issues. Whether these interim measures will be sufficient to avert further instability remains to be seen. What is evident, however, is that the AES’s departure represents a watershed moment that could reshaping economic, security, social, migratory and diplomatic relations in West Africa. Given that Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger occupy strategic areas of the Sahel, this separation has sparked concerns about the future of regional security and border cooperation. Observers fear a split in ECOWAS unity could undermine the region’s collective ability to combat transnational threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost in tandem with their ECOWAS withdrawal, the AES governments unveiled plans for a unified military force of 5,000 soldiers. Each of the three AES armies are expected to contribute troops, tasked with conducting joint operations in areas of intense jihadist activity. In their view, establishing a self-sufficient military partnership is the most dependable way to safeguard sovereignty. However, logistical coordination and consistent funding will be critical; previous initiatives, such as the G5 Sahel Joint Force, struggled with both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although 5,000 soldiers is a starting point, it will not be enough to secure a vast, geographically challenging territory spanning nearly three million square kilometres. Sustained success will require ongoing intelligence sharing, air support, and potentially selective partnerships for air capabilities. Partners for the latter may include non-Western powers such as Russia, Turkey or China, which have already been providing bilateral military assistance and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when AES countries are seeking to diversify their partnerships – as evidenced by the continued closure of Western military bases, including the US base in Niger in August 2024 and France’s base in Chad in December 2024 – other actors such as regional states are assuming more prominent roles. For instance, North African countries have heightened their involvement. Algeria, given its borders and historical ties to Mali, has always played a pivotal role in the region. Since the renewal of hostilities in northern Mali at the end of 2023, Algeria has once again been drawn into security and diplomatic tensions in the border area, particularly following clashes between armed groups and government forces in Tinzawaten, which lies right on the Algerian border. Another Maghreb country that has been intensifying its diplomatic and economic efforts to extend its influence across the Sahel is Morrocco, which has been providing development aid and infrastructure investments while positioning itself as a reliable partner to the military governments in the Central Sahel – particularly after ECOWAS sanctions led to border closures, preventing access to crucial harbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Morocco is championing the “Atlantic Initiative”, a strategy designed to offer Sahel countries another means of accessing the Atlantic Ocean via Moroccan ports, introducing an alternative trade route and strengthening road infrastructure. Because these countries are landlocked, access to Morocco’s ports offers a critical corridor to global markets, reducing their reliance on other neighbours. Another example of Morocco’s infrastructure and development partnership with the Central Sahel is its investment in a power plant in Niamey, inaugurated in December 2024. Niger had suffered electricity shortages due to sanctions imposed after its coup, and Morocco’s support helped reinforce Niger’s energy sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the changing landscape, Western partners have not fully disengaged from the Sahel. Many donor-funded programmes continue in sectors such as health, education and agriculture, recognising that security challenges often emerge from socio-economic disparities. The effectiveness of these programmes depends on strong collaboration with local authorities, who remain cautious of foreign interference. However, President Donald Trump’s decision in January 2025 to pause US foreign aid is having and will continue to have disruptive repercussions and has fuelled mistrust towards Western donors. This is therefore a critical moment for international donors to reinforce their support for Sahelian and West African populations during this period, recognising the importance of cross-border dynamics and collaborating with regional powers as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Success in achieving peace and prosperity in the Sahel and the West African region depends on cohesive, collective efforts that transcend national boundaries&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest lessons to emerge from the escalating violence in the Sahel is that jihadist insurgencies are not confined by national borders. Armed groups exploit weak governance and local grievances in border regions to establish cross-border supply lines, recruitment networks, and safe havens. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for any analysis of how security vacuums in the Sahel can spill over into neighbouring states. Jihadist organisations in the Sahel are far from monolithic. They adapt to military pressure, political changes, and shifting alliances, posing a formidable challenge for regional governments and their international allies. For nearly a decade, Bamako, the capital of Mali, had been spared high-profile jihadist attacks. That changed in September 2024, when Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin targeted both the École de Gendarmerie and the airport, resulting in multiple casualties and reviving memories of attacks on hotels and restaurants in the mid-2010s. In January 2025, two high-profile kidnappings involving Western nationals – in southern Algeria and in Niger’s Agadez region – demonstrated the fluid collaboration between various criminal, bandit and jihadist networks. These groups often cooperate along the so-called “kidnapping supply chain”, from identifying targets to ransom negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extremist violence once primarily localised in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso is gradually expanding into northern areas of coastal states such as Benin, Togo and, to a lesser degree, Ghana. Coastal states have therefore also become increasingly vocal about the southward spillover. Should cooperation between AES and these ECOWAS members weaken, their shared ability to conduct joint security operations and implement coordinated border controls would diminish, thereby increasing the risk of terrorist infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the West African security environment remains precarious, shaped by changing alliances, rising terrorist activity, and shifting international partnerships. The decision by Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger to leave ECOWAS and form the AES reflects a drive for self-reliance and diversified alliances. However, it also highlights the fragility of regional cooperation at a time when cross-border threats are intensifying. Sustained security responses will require robust intelligence sharing, joint operations, and socio-economic investments that address the root causes of conflict. Above all, the imperative of cross-border collaboration cannot be overstated. Whether through partnerships or coordination with regional and international actors, success in achieving peace and prosperity in the Sahel and the West African region depends on cohesive, collective efforts that transcend national boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;國安法後刊文章談及制裁林鄭 控方質疑不可能屬「不小心」 黎智英否認高層有共識發布&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（12日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第133日審訊，黎智英第41日作供，控方就《蘋果》英文版盤問黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《國安法》生效之後，《蘋果》刊登旅美作家「一劍飄塵」專欄文章〈美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎？〉，並翻譯成英文、刊登在英文版。控方質疑文章遍及實體報紙、網上中文版和英文版，須經過羅偉光、楊清奇和馮偉光等高層，乃非常不可能屬「不小心」。黎則否認高層之間有共識發布該文章。此外，控方展示一連串訊息，顯示黎籲應該集中於中國新聞，又要求員工將某些中文新聞翻譯成英文，質疑屬編採指示。黎稱當時英文版正處於被建立及形塑的階段，故直至2020年8月，他仍有挑選文章、叫同事納入英文版，但是後來逐漸淡出。控方質疑黎更改說法，而較早前的證供是不真實。黎解釋：「我忘記了這個建立的時期。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官甫開庭再度重申法庭審案只視乎證據和法律&quot;&gt;法官甫開庭再度重申法庭審案只視乎證據和法律&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，法官杜麗冰隨即表示，黎在庭上兩度稱自己為「政治犯」，因此有需要向黎說清楚，法庭審理案件只會視乎證據和相關法律，任何人抱持政治觀點，都要將政見「留在法庭之外」。杜官續指，法律面前人人平等，所有人在法庭面前都得到平等對待，他們都有權得到公平審訊，以上是她想提醒黎的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行其後問：「黎先生，你明白嗎？」黎未有正面回答，僅說：「請繼續。（Continue please.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎早前供稱曾推薦桑普替《蘋果》撰寫時評，惟時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹告訴他，桑普提倡港獨，因此最終打消念頭。控方今問黎從何時開始留意到桑普？黎稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另問，黎還有找什麼人協助尋找時評作家？黎稱只記得有 Mark Simon 和 Mark Clifford，其他人則不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇替蘋果撰社評談及制裁人權惡棍-黎稱甚少閱讀楊文章&quot;&gt;楊清奇替《蘋果》撰社評談及「制裁人權惡棍」 黎稱甚少閱讀楊文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著就另一名「從犯證人」、《蘋果》前主筆兼論壇版主管楊清奇（筆名李平）提問，並展示楊的社評文章〈制裁人權惡棍是釜底抽薪〉。控方指文章在2020年6月13日，即《國安法》生效之後發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎有否閱讀上述文章？黎則稱甚少閱讀《蘋果》社評，但有時會閱讀，因為喜歡顏純鈎（筆名方圓）撰寫的社評。至於副刊的專欄文章，黎稱每日都會看，但只會看部份專欄，因該些作者寫得非常好，例如馮睎乾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問，楊清奇撰寫的社評談及「制裁」，不會引起黎的興趣嗎？黎稱沒有，因為楊是論壇版主管，在《蘋果》工作多年，他熟知楊的寫作，對他而言不是新鮮事，所以對他的文章不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則指，黎不閱讀楊清奇的社評，是因為黎認為楊與他想法一致。黎則稱他起初有閱讀楊的社評，但是後來甚少閱讀。杜官問是否因為楊所寫的與黎所相信的一致？黎否認，提到楊來自中國，對他本人不熟悉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否知道楊與《蘋果》立場一致？黎同意。控方遂問，所以黎並沒有閱讀楊的文章？黎表示不是這個原因，只是因為黎不再對他感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，楊在文章中要求外國實施制裁。黎稱未曾閱讀該文章，也可能未曾「瞥一眼」。控方又問黎是否知道楊的文章被翻譯成英文？黎稱不知道。控方遂展示英文版文章〈Editorial: Bring the impact of Magnitsky Human Rights Act into full play〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年7月14日的《蘋果》社評〈中共的打壓與制裁不足畏〉，同樣由楊清奇所撰寫。黎稱未曾閱讀，也不知道它被翻譯成英文及被納入英文版。控方展示文章的英文版本〈Editorial: Who is Afraid of CCP Sanctions and Oppressions?〉，問黎社評是否理應反映一份報紙的立場？黎認同應該是。控方追問，所以這篇社評不會引起黎的興趣去看看？黎稱沒有興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;一劍飄塵文章指香港人權法案是對香港的幫助-黎承認與其立場一致&quot;&gt;「一劍飄塵」文章指香港人權法案是對香港的幫助 黎承認與其立場一致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及，黎曾推薦旅美作家「一劍飄塵」撰寫時評，並展示2020年6月24日的訊息紀錄，黎向楊清奇說：「李平，這一篇（一劍飄塵文章）是全版寫得最好的文章。謝謝。」楊回覆：「這個作者是新找到的。謝謝鼓勵」；黎表示：「很好（的）作者，對事件有認識及理論基礎。謝謝。」在控方盤問下，黎同意當時楊乃在黎的要求下，邀請「一劍飄塵」撰寫文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎供稱只看過「一劍飄塵」第一篇刊登的文章，便不記得他往後有否繼續替《蘋果》撰文。控方遂向黎出示「一劍飄塵」第一篇文章〈不要把 BLM 和反送中混為一談〉，文章提及：「香港人權法案在國會通過以後，有許多人擔心他（特朗普）會拒絕簽署。最終他沒簽嗎？也是他的團隊宣佈要開放對香港的移民簽證。這不都是對香港實實在在的幫助？」控方問上述字句是否與黎的立場一致？黎稱這是很多人的立場，控方追問當中是否包括黎，黎回答包括他自己。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;一劍飄塵文章問美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎-黎非提倡制裁&quot;&gt;「一劍飄塵」文章問「美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎？」 黎：非提倡制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示「一劍飄塵」另一篇文章〈美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎？〉，於2020年7月18日刊登於《蘋果》。黎稱沒有看過這篇文章。惟控方質疑，黎聲稱希望「一劍飄塵」撰寫更多文章，因此不會有興趣閱讀他的文章嗎？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，當黎「瞥一眼」報紙的時候，不會留意到「林鄭月娥」一字嗎？黎稱沒有。控方又問，文中所提及的制裁，不是黎一直以來尋求的嗎？黎重申他沒有閱讀該文章，無論控方問多少次，他都會這樣回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，黎早前供稱一直籲下屬在《國安法》之下謹慎行事，避免觸犯國安法，那麼為何容許下屬發布談及制裁的文章？黎回答李平是「把關者（Goalkeeper）」，對他予以信任。李官問黎會否認為李平不跟從他的指示？黎稱「一劍飄塵」可能在文章表示不認同制裁林鄭，但是得悉文章談及制裁之後，他估計可能作者一時疏忽，又或者其時制裁已經獲通過，而他並非正在提倡制裁。法官杜麗冰質疑，文章標題是「美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎？」，乃未來式而非過去式。黎僅稱他只是猜測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yFx55cB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《蘋果》總編輯羅偉光&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意非常不可能屬疏忽-惟否認有共識發布談及制裁文章&quot;&gt;黎同意非常不可能屬疏忽 惟否認有共識發布談及制裁文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示文章網上中文版本，《蘋果》網上版是由時任總編輯羅偉光負責，問黎是否想說羅偉光有疏忽？黎回答：「某程度上，是。」他指羅可能認為「一劍飄塵」在談論已經通過的法案，而不是在提倡制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官指文章作者似乎認為，若果美國政府制裁打壓新疆的中國官員的話，「他們會放過林鄭嗎？」，問黎是否同意作者？黎重申沒有閱讀過文章，但是認為作者只是提出問題而非提倡制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示文章網上英文版本，問黎是否允許時任英文版主筆馮偉光（筆名盧峯）發布相關文章？黎僅稱，馮發布之前未有徵求他的允許。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，發布〈美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎？〉一事中，遍及實體報紙、網上中文版和網上英文版，並涉及五名高層，包括張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、楊清奇和馮偉光，是否非常不可能屬「不小心」？黎同意，但否認高層之間有共識發布該文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎籲英文版只報導中國新聞-否認下編採指示-反稱是營商指示&quot;&gt;黎籲英文版只報導中國新聞 否認下編採指示 反稱是「營商指示」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示「English news」群組訊息，黎傳送《蘋果》英文新聞連結〈Republicans say Biden ‘Good for Iran and ISIS. Great for China’（共和黨指拜登對伊朗和伊斯蘭國而言是好、對中國而言是棒）〉，並說：「我不認為這類新聞有需要，因為當地的媒體理應已有報導。我反而認為我們應該集中於中國新聞，以及使別人知道我們集中於中國新聞。（“I don’t think this kind of news is needed since wherever they come their local news media should have covered it. I rather think that we should focus on Chinese news and be known for it without dilution.”）」馮回覆：「好吧，由今天起停止做國際新聞。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問這是否黎的編採指示。黎否認，強調只是經營一門生意應有的方式，即是集中在應該做的事上，避免被沖淡。控方則指黎是在掌舵《蘋果》的運作方向。黎堅稱這是營商原則，使《蘋果》集中在中國新聞，以免主旨被沖淡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰質疑這是一個編採指示，黎想集中在中國新聞，而不是國際新聞，因為其後馮偉光回覆訊息表示：「好吧，由今天起停止做國際新聞。」黎堅稱：「這是營商指示（business direction），這是我們應該怎樣經營的方式。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在盤問下，黎同意當時持續監督《蘋果》英文版。控方續指，黎就應該發布什麼新聞方面給予職員指示。黎則稱，當時是提出「營商焦點（business focus）」，因為英文版仍然很新，所以持續監督。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎訊息叫盧峯盡快將新聞加入英文版-惟否認給予指示&quot;&gt;黎訊息叫盧峯「盡快」將新聞加入英文版 惟否認給予指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年6月15日的訊息，黎向馮偉光傳送一則連結〈新编高中教材“毛泽东思想”回归！透露重大信号？〉，並問：「以上新聞是否已在英文版？謝謝。」馮回覆：「還沒有」，黎表示：「請盡快，謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎否認向馮給予指示，僅傳送一些有趣的東西給馮。控方質疑，但是黎叫馮「請盡快」？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又質疑，當黎在網上看到有趣的文章，不會叫職員去翻譯成英文，然後在英文版發布嗎？黎則稱沒有，因這不是他的職責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎改認要求職員將新聞翻譯成英文-因英文版正處於被建立及形塑的階段&quot;&gt;黎改認要求職員將新聞翻譯成英文 因英文版正處於被建立及形塑的階段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示群組訊息，黎於6月28日向群組傳送兩張報紙報導的相片，分別為〈條文後日通過 駐港公署7.1運作 違國安惡法可囚終身〉和〈鍾國斌：《自治法》嚴重威脅商界〉。黎稱：「Lo Fung, Hope these two items of news have English edition later. Thanks, Jimmy（盧峯，希望這兩則新聞稍後有英文版本，謝謝。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，從訊息可見黎的確有叫員工將某些新聞翻譯成英文。黎稱當時英文版正處於被建立及形塑的階段，形容「產品尚未成形」，需要「反覆試驗（trial and error）」，所以會叫職員要做什麼新聞，但之後便沒有再作出要求，因為知道職員會自動去做。控方質疑黎更改早前說法，並追問黎在哪時開始不再要求，黎稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎多次要求馮偉光將新聞翻譯成英文-讓他發布在twitter&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎多次要求馮偉光將新聞翻譯成英文 讓他發布在Twitter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示訊息，顯示黎在2020年6月28日至7月1日期間，多次向馮偉光傳送報紙照片，要求翻譯成英文，分別為〈03年以來7.1遊行首被禁 民陣指全世界見證港人權倒退〉、〈醫護或須宣誓 醫生協會：不能違背良知〉、〈777向聯合國死撐司法仍獨立〉。黎並向馮偉光說：「Lo Fung, I hope the above would have English editions later. Thanks, Jimmy（盧峯，我希望以上可以稍後有英文版本，謝謝。）」馮回覆：「Yes, some of these already on line.（是的，部份已經在網上。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰一度問：「什麼是777？」黎指是前特首林鄭月娥。法官李素蘭以中文說出「777」，問是否這個「777」？黎回答是。控方問，這是否帶貶意的稱呼？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2020年7月14日的訊息，黎向馮傳送數張報紙的照片〈立會初選電子投票結果：本土派素人大勝〉、〈警曾搜查香港民研 接觸所有電器系統 結果外洩 掀國安監控恐慌〉、〈狀告政府瞞疫 法院拒立案 武肺難屬抗爭 官《國安法》恐嚇〉。黎並向馮說：「Lo Fung, When above news have English edition please forward for me for my Twitter posting. Thanks, Jimmy（盧峯，當以上新聞有英文版本時，請轉發給我讓我發布在 Twitter。謝謝。）」馮回覆：「Sure（一定會。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在2020年8月26日向英文版群組「English news」傳送兩張報紙相片，標題為〈中共威權炮製惜食鬧劇 專家：政策半年玩完〉，副標題為〈每年進口糧食一億噸 難自給自足〉。黎在群組中詢問：「這些新聞很重要，我們有翻譯嗎？謝謝。」同年6月12日，黎亦傳送訊息：「今日評論版潘小濤李平，甚至抗爭者的文章都可翻譯，我估我們一定知道，只不過順便一提，謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;針對黎早上稱沒有閱讀論壇版，控方指從訊息可見他其實有閱讀。黎確認有時會閱讀。法官李素蘭問到，黎有否每日翻開整份報紙來看？黎稱有，但是當他不在香港的時候，便無法看報紙。控方問，當黎身處外地時，會否看《蘋果》網上版新聞？黎稱只有看中文版，但是沒有看英文版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎認英文版面世後三個月持續挑選文章-惟隨時間淡出&quot;&gt;黎認英文版面世後三個月持續挑選文章 惟隨時間淡出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎其後傳送訊息：「對不起，起初沒看清楚，這有權鬥內容應該是好的花絮。謝謝。」黎在庭上確認訊息是指關於中共的權鬥，希望同事能將有關新聞納入英文版。控方問這是否符合黎想要中國負面新聞的想法？黎則稱，他認為中共權鬥內容對於讀者而言是有趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月26日，黎向群組傳送訊息：「劍虹，盧峯，我認為 English Edition 的新聞太少，雖然評論算不錯，但新聞是重點，要想法子增加。謝謝。」控方質疑，所以黎其實有閱讀英文版的評論文章。法官李素蘭問，黎剛才早上又說他只閱讀英文版的新聞？黎則回應，當時英文版尚在建立階段，所以曾經瀏覽英文版網站，去查看新聞數量。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎在早上所供稱的說法是錯誤的。黎回應：「我忽略了這個建立的階段。」控方質疑，或者證供是不真實的？黎重申：「我忘記了這個建立的時期。」控方再度追問這個建立時段有多長；黎稱不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，這是一個持續建立的過程，所以黎持續參與在建立的過程之中？黎同意。控方指從訊息紀錄可見，直至2020年8月，黎仍有挑選文章、叫同事納入英文版。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭問，直至2020年8月，即英文版面世三個月之後，黎仍然持續關注英文版？黎同意，但同時稱他隨著時間而淡出。控方指，因為當時同事已經知道黎的想法，並且知道應在英文版發布什麼文章。黎則回應，其他同事亦有在群組中傳送文章，但是當英文版運作逐漸成熟之後，他愈來愈少傳送文章，其後更沒有傳送。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周二（2月18日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（11日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第132日審訊，黎智英第40日作供，控方就《蘋果》運作盤問黎。《蘋果》在2020年5月發起「一人一信救香港」，黎安排員工替袁弓夷拍攝影片，向特朗普作公開呼籲。控方展示訊息，顯示袁弓夷的女兒袁彌明曾傳送講稿給黎當中提及制裁中共，而黎讚寫得好。控方質疑，黎同意袁弓夷的公開信內容，並提供《蘋果》作為發布平台。黎則否認。此外，黎曾叫管理層推動英文版時，只需集中「黃營觀點」；黎在庭上同意只需要不平衡的觀點（imbalanced view），但是否認這是偏頗的觀點（biased view），重申是想要反映香港情況的觀點。在控方盤問期間，黎稱自己作為一個政治犯，沒有理由為求脫罪而在庭上說謊，法官杜麗冰隨即打斷，嚴正地向黎說：「你不是一個政治犯，你在這裡是面對刑事控罪。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意使用蘋果日報來催谷更多人上街&quot;&gt;黎同意使用《蘋果日報》來催谷更多人上街&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問，圍繞黎與《蘋果》高層之間的溝通。控方向黎展示訊息紀錄，黎於2019年4月27日分別向時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹及副社長陳沛敏稱：「請想想有什麼我們還可做催谷市民明天上街？現在情況實在太靜，好驚。謝謝。」控方問，黎傳送訊息目的是想催谷更多人上街遊行？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著指2019年6月3日，即6月9日「反送中」大遊行前數天，黎向陳沛敏傳送訊息：「沛敏，我們應該找些聯署學生訪問，激發其他學生6.9出來。謝謝。」陳回覆：「有的，會再找，謝謝。」黎續指：「主要是訪問他們不是針對『師兄』『師姐』而是激發其他學生出來。謝謝。」陳回覆：「收到。」控方指，黎再次叫陳催谷更多人上街，而這一次是鼓勵年輕人出來。黎亦同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，他記得當時有一群中學生呼籲罷課，問黎是否有印象。黎則稱他們不是聯署的學生，聯署的是大學生，而罷課則是黃之鋒。法官杜麗冰表示，她記得當時從報章中讀到林鄭母校嘉諾撒聖方濟各書院有學生進行聯署。黎則堅稱參與聯署的是大學生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎籲陳沛敏考慮以不撤不散作為頭版標題-惟否認屬編採指示&quot;&gt;黎籲陳沛敏考慮以「不撤不散」作為頭版標題 惟否認屬編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎於2019年6月15日向陳傳送訊息：「我們只好行動日漸加劇，迎接詭計來臨！」、「不撤不散！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上否認向陳提議頭版報導標題，但同意使用《蘋果日報》來催谷更多人上街。法官杜麗冰指黎的訊息籲陳考慮以「不撤不散」作為標題，質疑屬編採指示。黎否認，強調只是叫陳予以「考慮」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意使用蘋果日報協助袁弓夷製作影片籲特朗普救香港&quot;&gt;黎同意使用《蘋果日報》協助袁弓夷製作影片籲特朗普救香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續提到，《蘋果》在2020年5月發起「一人一信救香港」，籲時任美國總統特朗普幫助香港阻止國安法通過，現被國安處通緝的袁弓夷曾拍片響應，而黎當時提供平台發布影片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示訊息，2020年5月28日黎向袁說，可以安排《蘋果》同事替袁拍攝影片，並指時任動新聞平台總監張志偉稍後會聯絡袁。至5月31日，黎向袁弓夷說：「剛從 Erica（袁彌明）收到它，真的很棒！」、「請繼續發聲！」至6月3日，袁弓夷向黎說：「感謝你提供平台去開展我摧毀中共的目標。我會在星期日到華盛頓，向白宮請求援助香港。（Jimmy, thank you for providing me the platform to start my mission to destroy CCP. I will go to Washington Sunday to plead for help for HK from the White House.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否同意袁弓夷的發言內容？黎供稱，當時僅提供一個平台去播出袁弓夷的發言，堅稱並不知道影片內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，黎是否使用《蘋果日報》來協助袁製作公開信影片，包括提供拍攝場地及製作人員？黎同意，但強調袁只是一個人讀出公開信，拍攝過程不需很多人手，他自己也沒有參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰質疑，黎不僅僅提供平台播放袁的影片，事後黎向張志偉提議再一次替袁製作影片，而張隨即回覆「收到」及表示會安排，顯示黎所作的超出了僅僅提供平台。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎堅稱拍攝之前不知道袁弓夷將會說什麼&quot;&gt;黎堅稱拍攝之前不知道袁弓夷將會說什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在盤問下，黎堅稱拍攝之前不知道袁將會作出什麼發言內容，也沒有問袁。控方質疑，即使不知道袁會說什麼，黎也會允許《蘋果》替袁拍片？黎說是。控方亦質疑，當時《蘋果》正發動「一人一信救香港」，不擔心袁的說話會與行動理念相違背嗎？黎則表示對此並不擔心，又指他們通常不會在發布之前審查言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官杜麗冰問，如果袁在拍片時說：「特朗普遠離香港和中國，不要管我們的事！」呢？黎則回應，知道袁的為人，「我知道這不會發生。」杜官和控方分別追問，所以黎是知道袁將會說什麼嗎？黎稱只知道大概，並且知道他支持運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提議，黎其實在拍攝之前知道袁將會說什麼。黎不同意。控方亦提議，黎也觀看過袁的影片。黎稱可能有觀看過。控方則反駁，在影片發布之前，黎是知道影片內容。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑黎早前供稱袁信件含不實指控-為何會讚寫得好&quot;&gt;官質疑黎早前供稱袁信件含不實指控 為何會讚寫得好&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示黎與袁弓夷女兒袁彌明之間的對話。2020年5月29日，袁彌明告訴黎：「早安，Jimmy。我父親正在前往你的總部，他給特朗普的信很出色和感動。（Morning Jimmy. My dad is heading to your headquarter now. His letter to Trump is exceptional and emotional.）」袁彌明並傳送袁弓夷的信件全文給黎，當中提到：「你應該制裁這些中共個體，不讓他們得到任何更多美國資本。（You should sanction these Communist entities from getting any more US capital.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎其後回覆：「Erica，感謝你。這是一封很好的信。希望特朗普總統會看到它及作出回應。（Erica, Thanks. This is a very good letter. Hope President Trump will see it and react.）」控方問黎是否同意信件內容？黎則稱，他說信件寫得好不代表他同意當中內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提及，黎早前主問時指袁在影片中作出不實指控，包括指稱有示威者被謀殺及有警察強姦女子，那黎為什麼會向袁彌明說其父親的信寫得好？黎則稱當時未有留意相關內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著問，黎早前供稱不同意袁指控警察強姦女子及有示威者被謀殺，然而黎直至在庭上才首次供出這個說法，訊息紀錄從不見黎說該些指控不實。黎同意，但是強調後來與袁弓夷數次交流之後，便開始感到不安，並嘗試疏遠他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎認為袁做過什麼行為而使他感到不安？黎多次表示不記得，又強調是感覺積累而來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IJ0IQNJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;袁彌明稱父親準備在下一段影片談及制裁-黎允張志偉協助製作&quot;&gt;袁彌明稱父親準備在下一段影片談及制裁 黎允張志偉協助製作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示訊息，2020年5月31日袁彌明告訴黎，袁弓夷正準備拍攝另一段影片，要求蓬佩奧讓年輕示威者在美國最好的學校接受教育，並提供經濟援助，又會談及幾種「較聰明的方法」制裁，以對中共造成影響，但同時對香港人帶來較低附帶傷害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;袁彌明問黎：「我們可以叫張志偉協助嗎？上一次的後期製作非常棒，正正是我們想要的。」黎回覆稱會告訴張，籲袁彌明聯絡張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;袁彌明其後指上一段影片「有60萬人view，多謝你們大力推。」、「最緊要幫到件事。」黎之後告訴袁，已經替袁約好拍攝時間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，袁彌明所提及的「較聰明的方法」是指哪些制裁？黎則稱不知道，袁彌明未有詳細說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意提供蘋果的網站facebook和twitter發布袁弓夷影片&quot;&gt;黎同意提供《蘋果》的網站、Facebook和Twitter發布袁弓夷影片&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示黎與張志偉之間的訊息，張在5月31日向黎傳送《蘋果》Facebook 截圖，顯示帖文〈【港版國安法】袁彌明父親打Twitter戰線 公開拍片望特朗普拯救香港青年〉，並以箭咀指出「讚好」次數。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，黎將袁彌明的訊息轉發給張，告知張他們準備拍攝下一段影片。張回覆：「收到！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至6月3日，張向黎傳送《蘋果》Facebook 截圖，顯示帖文〈【六四31】袁彌明父Twitter續發炮 促美國務卿懲中共罪犯解放香港〉。張另傳送一張《蘋果》Twitter 截圖，顯示轉載了袁弓夷的影片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎不但提供《蘋果》網站，還提供了《蘋果》的 Facebook 和 Twitter 來發布袁的影片。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到黎當時知道標題上「解放香港」的意思嗎？在追問下，黎同意知道，但稱當時「瞥一眼」時未有留意到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問黎不會關注《蘋果》發布的內容嗎？黎稱：「我不會關注那些內容，張志偉會負責。」控方追問，當時《蘋果》發起「一人一信救香港」，黎不會關注相關內容嗎？黎重申他不關注，所以未有想過，並堅稱只是對相關內容「瞥一眼」，因為不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎的確閱讀過及知道袁的信件，亦同意當中內容，因此黎才會同意在《蘋果》上發布，而這與「一人一信救香港」行動一致。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意帶領蘋果-但否認作出指示&quot;&gt;黎同意帶領《蘋果》 但否認作出指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎是壹傳媒集團的大股東，持有大約71%的股份，而三間被告公司「蘋果日報有限公司」、「蘋果日報印刷有限公司」及「蘋果互聯網有限公司」屬於壹傳媒集團旗下，因此黎控制著三間公司。控方又指，黎在2018年至2020年12月期間，是壹傳媒集團的主席，向集團提供數以萬計的資金援助。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否同意自己是公司中「作出指示的人士（directing mind）」和「掌控者（controlling mind）」。黎表示：「我沒有指示他們的思想。」他又稱自己是制訂藍圖的人，但是並非作出指示的人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否帶領《蘋果》？黎同意。控方繼而問黎是否《蘋果》的掌舵手？黎不同意，僅稱自己是主席。他承認在發起「一人一信救香港」一事上，當員工意見與他不一致時，他的意見佔上風，但那只是一次例外，不代表旗下員工要時刻跟從他意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認設下鳥籠-稱員工共同抱持價值&quot;&gt;黎否認設下「鳥籠」 稱員工共同抱持價值&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎曾經叫《蘋果》其他管理層報導「黃營」的觀點，問黎是否同意每當《蘋果》作新聞報導的時候，高層之間均存在共識。黎則稱他與管理層並沒有共識，形容「所有事都是自動發生的」，因《蘋果》與香港人擁抱一致的價值。法官李素蘭則指：「黎先生，香港人不一定與《蘋果》抱持一致的價值」，籲黎只需要直接回答問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述黎在台灣節目「鄉民來衝康」的受訪言論「這麼多年來我們是反共的」，指《蘋果》一直以來都是「反共」及反對派報紙，而這是「從犯證人」楊清奇所形容的「鳥籠」。黎回應：「鳥籠是我們在《蘋果》共同抱持的價值。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎提議，這是黎所設下的「鳥籠」。黎否認有設下鳥籠，又指《蘋果》的價值不只是他自己的價值，也是員工共同抱持的價值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又提議，黎的確有叫管理層使用《蘋果》作為平台來反對政府，包括要求管理層多報導反修例運動及催谷市民上街遊行。黎稱不是「反對政府」，而是反對《引渡條例》修訂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎指示管理層使用《蘋果》作為平台來爭取國際社會及西方的支持，希望外國會針對中央和特區政府實施制裁。黎否認，並強調只是引起國際關注香港當時狀況，而非對抗中央和特區政府。控方指黎在「飯盒會」上向高層給予編採指示。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎向高層稱只集中黃營觀點-同意不平衡觀點但否認屬偏頗&quot;&gt;黎向高層稱只集中「黃營」觀點 同意不平衡觀點但否認屬偏頗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著就《蘋果》英文版提問，指美國國務院前資深顧問 Christian Whiton 以電郵提議《蘋果》應創辦英文版報紙。2020年5月10日，作家馮睎乾專欄文章〈不撐蘋果的100萬人〉提到《蘋果》增值的方法包括「八卦式公義」和「國際文宣線」。控方問黎，是否同意英文版的工作與國際文宣相似？黎僅稱，只是引起國際社會關注香港情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎於5月10日創立 WhatsApp 群組「English news」，群組成員有張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、張志偉等人。黎在群組中說：「今日馮睎乾提議出英譯新聞電子版諗得過，反正現在翻譯網站翻譯成本低而快。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，黎訊息稱：「我們揀選寫手時，我們不需要向外國人提供平衡觀點，我們只需要集中在《蘋果》的香港觀點和黃營的一般觀點。」（“When we choose writers we don’t have to think about giving foreigners a balanced view of what happens here of every different colors, we only concentrate in our Apple Daily HK view, a general view of the yellow side.”）黎又指：「我們不是要嘗試平衡報導，而是要報導保護香港一方的觀點。這是世界需要知道的聲音。」（“We are not trying to strike a balance but the point of view of the people on the side of protecting HK. This is the voice the world wants to know.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎只要員工報導中國的負面新聞，不需要正面的報導？黎同意。此外，黎同意只需要不平衡的觀點（imbalanced view），但是否認這是偏頗的觀點（biased view），重申是想要反映香港情況的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官杜麗冰追問下，黎指不平衡的觀點不代表是偏頗。黎指當時香港被中國的政策淹沒（overwhelmed），這對香港而言不是好事，而「黃營」是要反抗中國對自由的侵蝕，這就是他們的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否想根據他的個人角度來展示香港面貌。黎表示，是從報導的角度出發，不只在情緒層面打動讀者，更想引起他們心中共鳴。黎又指，所有報紙都是作不平衡報導，例如《星島日報》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎自稱政治犯沒有理由在庭上說謊-官打斷稱你不是一個政治犯&quot;&gt;黎自稱政治犯沒有理由在庭上說謊 官打斷稱：「你不是一個政治犯」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎早前供稱，從沒有叫同事替專欄「成敗樂一笑」的文章翻譯成英文，他亦不知道同事曾翻譯；但是5月11日的訊息紀錄顯示，張劍虹向群組傳送訊息，其中第一點提及會翻譯「成敗樂一笑」文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則稱當時未有留意，並看漏了第一點。在控方追問下，黎反問：「我為何要說謊？」，指在法庭說謊是罪行，作為一個政治犯，他沒有理由為求脫罪而在庭上說謊，使自己被定罪，又反問控方是否認為他會如此做，顯示自己不單是一名政治犯，而且還是一個傻子（mentally retarded）？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰隨即打斷，嚴正地向黎說：「你不是一個政治犯，你在這裡是面對刑事控罪。」黎則稱：「你可以這樣提議，但是你不能以此加諸於我身上。」杜官稱只是想提醒黎他並非政治犯，黎稱：「但是我與你的想法不同。」杜官說黎可以有不同的想法，然而事實是：「你不是一名政治犯」。黎回應：「這是據你所說。（According to you.）」杜官再度打斷，並嚴正表示：「黎先生！⋯⋯你想將政治帶進這個法庭，我不會容許你這樣做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎當時政治環境對蘋果不友善-英文版能成為龐大的支持&quot;&gt;黎：當時政治環境對《蘋果》不友善 英文版能成為龐大的支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在2020年5月10日向 Mark Simon 傳送訊息，談及《蘋果》英文版可以有一個機會讓美國人或外國人支持香港，而這將會是龐大的經濟上及政治上的支持，形容是「一件現在就要做的事，尤其是作為政治保護」，籲 Mark Simon 安排對外宣傳工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問訊息中的「龐大的經濟上及政治上的支持」是否包括對中國制裁和敵對行動？黎指不是。控方又問「政治保護」即是什麼保護？黎稱保護《蘋果》免受任何政府的干預。控方追問黎想要哪一種「政治保護」？黎稱未有詳細想過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問《蘋果》為何需要保護？黎稱：「當時的政治環境對《蘋果》不友善」，因《蘋果》是反對派報紙。控方質疑這是黎的揣測；黎則稱這是他對當時形勢的解讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎曾叫mark-simon找彭斯蓬佩奧訂閱-最終未成事&quot;&gt;黎曾叫Mark Simon找彭斯、蓬佩奧訂閱 最終未成事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指同日，黎叫 Mark Simon 嘗試令時任美國副總統彭斯及時任國務卿蓬佩奧訂閱《蘋果》英文版。至5月12日，Mark Simon 告訴黎，他已聯絡蓬佩奧助手 Mary Kissel，會研究怎樣使蓬佩奧或美國國務院訂閱，他亦聯絡了時任共和黨參議員盧比奧（Marco Rubio）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎只叫 Mark Simon 如此做，而不是叫《蘋果》管理層，是因為黎知道 Mark Simon 與美國政府有緊密聯繫。黎則表示，因為他知道 Mark Simon 找到方法去做，但是後來因為美國官員相關規定而未有成事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

There is an urgent need to strengthen user literacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative AI tools based on Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming embedded in many aspects of daily life, from assisting professionals with legal research to helping shoppers with their weekly groceries and enabling learning about Socrates through chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent events have highlighted emerging risks to security and democratic stability. The use of ChatGPT to assist in planning an attack on President Donald Trump’s Las Vegas hotel demonstrates the grey areas in which AI can be exploited to catalyse real-world harm. Similarly, concerns over DeepSeek, a Chinese AI system that self-censors in real time and stores user data beyond democratic oversight, underscore wider implications for national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hallmark of this technology is its low user cost and its ability to rapidly converse fluently and confidently like a human. For instance, it can persuasively argue that AI poses no threat to humanity. As well as answering questions, these systems can interrogate documents, write code, generate video, and carry out basic online tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing the technology’s creative applications to develop freely and making it widely available has been key to attracting staggering levels of investment in the sector. Today, AI-powered tools have hundreds of millions of weekly users. However, this widespread adoption is also where the risks lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside cyber security vulnerabilities intrinsic to LLM technology, concerns have been raised about its potential to flood democracies with disinformation and propaganda, as well as providing a sophisticated aid to extremist recruitment. From the standpoint of communications practice, the risks are more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When data is stored in foreign jurisdictions, this raises the possibility of hostile actors extracting valuable population insights from users’ interactions with AI, as individuals often unwittingly reveal their attitudes and behaviours in relation to their preferences. In this sense, AI users everywhere are unknowingly training an unsleeping, ever-evolving algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-double-edged-nature-of-generative-ai&quot;&gt;The Double-Edged Nature of Generative AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much attention is being paid to the technological and economic race, the long-term societal impact of AI’s persuasive power remains largely overlooked. Recent research studies demonstrate that generative AI excels at moral reasoning, narrative creativity and psychological profiling and even anticipates emotional states – all achieved automatically. The potential impact of these superhuman qualities is not widely understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AI-driven chatbots and their API-integrated systems can seamlessly analyse audiences, generate targeted content, and distribute it efficiently&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National security concerns have focused on scenarios like AI exposing sensitive chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear information or spiralling out of control. Europol has warned that LLMs could scale up and accelerate cyber attacks. However, the erosion of trust and the potential for large-scale behavioural manipulation may be equally disruptive. Leaked documents revealed that AI researchers highlighted how their technology could lower the cost of disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of AI lies in its adaptability to user demands and its capacity to adopt their preferred personae. Generative AI companies make their application programming interfaces (APIs) widely available so that AI can be incorporated into all sorts of software, search engines and social media services, allowing these systems to be fine-tuned for specific purposes. With few restrictions and trained on historical data going back thousands of years, AI can synthesise – or distort – a startling array of ideas, facts and narratives at an unprecedented speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is constantly improving. Almost a decade ago, DeepMind’s AlphaGo shocked the world by defeating human champions and demonstrating inexplicable strategic creativity. Today’s generative AI matches or outperforms humans in many creative disciplines. Its ability to recreate reality, without the biases of conscience or ego, presents both a remarkable capability and a potential threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When disinformation watchdog Newsguard presented ChatGPT with narratives already proven to be false, the AI doubled down and eloquently defended 80% of debunked claims. Though there were examples of effective moderation, researchers indicate that the results were similar to those advanced by the worst conspiracy influencers or Chinese and Russian government bots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rise-of-mass-personalised-influence&quot;&gt;The Rise of Mass, Personalised Influence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most profound changes brought by generative AI is its ability to anticipate user intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Cambridge University have found that, with just a small number of chatbot interactions, AI can accurately predict a user’s future intentions. This shift from an “attention economy”, in which algorithms sought to capture users’ engagement, to what they call an “intention economy”, where AI can anticipate and exploit desires and decisions before they are even consciously formed, represents a fundamental transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for disinformation? A series of experimental studies demonstrated the potential of LLMs to automate, and therefore scale up, personalised persuasion. Personalised messages generated by ChatGPT in the areas of marketing, political ideology, and personality traits proved more influential that non-personalised messages. AI-generated content has been found to be particularly persuasive, as it can read and respond to individual psychological traits. The application of the technology, in which consumers and citizens will have their decisions second-guessed and nudged, has the alarming potential to increase distrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is far from perfect, but the risk of automated, mass manipulation is real. AI-driven chatbots and their API-integrated systems can seamlessly analyse audiences, generate targeted content, and distribute it efficiently – collapsing a series of tasks previously shared out between communications firms and marketing professionals. With the right expertise and application to social media, for instance, these capabilities could be exploited for radicalisation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI developers are building in safeguards so that obviously harmful prompts go unanswered. However, one recent study demonstrated that chatbots remain vulnerable to manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a technique known as “jailbreaking”, researchers were able to bypass moderation controls in half of the cases tested, allowing chatbots to help the researchers play out scenarios mirroring likely violent extremist activities, including creating divisive content or misinformation, and even providing guidance on recruitment and attack strategies. Even a chatbot’s moderation control preventing it from analysing individual social media feeds can be overcome with a little persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militant groups, such as Islamic State, have reportedly explored AI’s potential for their own purposes. However, the true disruptive power of AI may not come from state actors or extremist groups, but rather from the sheer volume of artificially generated narratives, amplifying confusion and further eroding trust in reliable sources of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popularity of companion chatbots illustrates another dimension of AI’s persuasive power: its apparent ability to empathise with human users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study comparing human emotional awareness to that of ChatGPT, the AI system outperformed human participants. Because generative AI can adapt to an individual’s emotional and psychological state, researchers found a “dangerous potential to further enmesh people in their own idiosyncratic worlds”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has implications for recruitment into violence. Following an inquiry into the Stockport attack, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer recently warned that “loners and misfits” face growing risks of radicalisation through an array of content encountered online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While today’s AI does not yet possess general reasoning capabilities, the pace of its evolution indicates that societies must adapt now&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, LLMs outperform humans in instances of moral reasoning. AI-generated messages can appear virtuous and trustworthy, provided users are unaware that the source is artificial. Consequently, in a democracy, those with malign intent are vulnerable to exposure if their use of such technology can be demonstrated, though this will be difficult in practice. Certainly, there was ideological pushback among supporters of an Islamic State affiliate when a sympathetic media channel adopted AI-generated newsreaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the marketing and communications industry is not simply promoting itself in talking down generative AI; in many cases, technology needs a human face to be believed. Many AI companies are looking to strengthen user empowerment and autonomy through technical design. But responses need to go further to maintain human control of the technology, requiring a focus on educating the user so they can harness the benefits while avoiding the pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengthening-democratic-resilience&quot;&gt;Strengthening Democratic Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons from the rise and misuse of social media suggest that societies must act swiftly. While today’s AI does not yet possess general reasoning capabilities, the pace of its evolution indicates that societies must adapt now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions often focus on existential threats posed by AI, but the more immediate, practical challenges of generative AI are frequently overlooked. The safeguards and guardrails being designed into LLMs are decisive, but they are little understood and barely discussed outside a limited circle of experts. Without more democratic discussion, generative AI’s emerging role in shaping public discourse will remain opaque. Few people understand how these systems operate, and this must change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best aspects of social media lie in its ability to redistribute democratic power. Generative AI is more complex and necessitates sustained discussion and attention to defend democracies. Some governments have started to do this. In an era of disruption, societies and individuals equipped with knowledge and resources will be better positioned to navigate the coming waves of informational and economic transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply exposing disinformation or identifying dangerous influencers will not be enough. To maintain democratic control, users must be empowered as citizens. AI literacy must extend beyond technical proficiency to equipping individuals, as part of society, to navigate the complexities of AI-generated influence and uphold democratic values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, regulating social media could have been handled far better. Failing to address AI’s influence today could be a far graver mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英受訪稱「倘修例傳媒冇得做」 控方質疑修例與新聞自由沒有關係&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DrLsxnm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（10日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第131日審訊，黎智英第39日作供，控方就《蘋果日報》盤問黎。訊息紀錄顯示7.1佔領立法會事件之後，黎籲時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏：「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情，令指責他們的市民反省。」黎早前供稱只是「提議」而非編採指示，今則改稱屬於編採指示。另外，2019年4月黎在「反送中」遊行期間受訪稱，若果《引渡條例》修訂通過的話「傳媒冇得做」，控方質疑修例與傳媒生意和新聞自由無關。黎則重申，如果傳媒報導中國內地新聞會被視為「揭露國家機密」；又如果傳媒批評政府會被視為「顛覆國家安全」，這便會與傳媒非常有關係。控方指出，黎意圖藉言論引起市民憎恨政府。黎則回應：「一派胡言。（Totally rubbish.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎曾轉發ipac帖文-質疑黎聲稱不知道是為了撇清關係&quot;&gt;控方指黎曾轉發IPAC帖文 質疑黎聲稱不知道是為了撇清關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問，圍繞黎對「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC）的理解。控方展示2020年7月22日的 Twitter 帖文，顯示黎轉發 IPAC 的帖文，而 IPAC 帖文提及英國政府宣布暫緩與香港之間的引渡協議，IPAC 成員兼英國議員 Alyn Smith 在英國下議院發言時表示歡迎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則稱，帖文是由「徒弟」李兆富（Simon Lee）發布。控方則提議，黎當時知悉 IPAC 支持英政府暫緩與香港之間的引渡協議，而且非常在意 IPAC 的成立，也非常在意 IPAC 的成立目標，即是一致應對中國崛起的挑戰。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎透過將 IPAC 報導放在《蘋果》顯眼版面，以及不同的 Twitter 帖文，以顯示支持 IPAC。黎亦否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎知悉「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK）與 IPAC 有關。黎否認。控方指，黎聲稱不知道 IPAC，是因為想嘗試與 IPAC 撇清關係。黎則稱，他與 IPAC 從沒接近過，並堅稱從沒留意 IPAC。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官李運騰提問下，黎確認當時李兆富已經不在香港，因此更加「安全」。控方問，黎的意思是否指，因為李不在香港，所以他可以發布任何他想發布的內容，即使有關內容觸犯《國安法》？黎則表示：「我沒有這樣說，是你說的。」但黎同意正如他早前所供稱，他會為所有 Twitter 帖文負責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方警方檢取黎手機時-其-twitter-帳戶呈登入狀態-代表黎經常查看&quot;&gt;控方：警方檢取黎手機時 其 Twitter 帳戶呈登入狀態 代表黎「經常查看」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，沒有爭議的是，黎的 Twitter 追蹤 IPAC、聯盟創辦人裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）及 SWHK 的帳號。控方指出，在《國安法》生效之後，黎渴望知道外國組織會怎樣回應《國安法》；黎則稱：「我沒有思考過。」控方又指，黎有興趣知道外國政治人物會怎樣作出回應；黎則稱：「我沒有這樣的渴望」，又稱沒有思考過這方面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，當時黎竭力去阻止《國安法》通過，即使《國安法》生效之後，黎繼續竭力去減弱《國安法》的效力，因此黎有興趣知道外國政治人物怎樣作出回應，理應是合乎邏輯的事。黎重申沒有思考過這方面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎從沒閱讀任何他所追蹤的帳號的帖文？黎則稱其 Twitter 帳戶由李兆富管理，他不知道，也沒有興趣知道。控方指，黎被拘捕的時候，當警方檢取他的手機時，其 Twitter 帳戶呈登入狀態，代表黎「經常查看 Twitter」。黎否認，並稱不常使用 Twitter，忘記了是否每日都使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎提議，他對於外國政治人物如何回應《國安法》是非常感興趣。黎回應稱：「我沒有想過。」控方續指，黎持續追蹤外國政治人物發布的 Twitter 帖文。黎再度稱：「我沒有想過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎堅稱不知道-hashtag-是什麼&quot;&gt;黎堅稱不知道 hashtag 是什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另問及 hashtag，黎早前供稱他從不知 hashtag 是什麼，帖文上的 hashtag 乃由李兆富添加。黎稱一般而言不會留意帖文上的 hashtag。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示一系列黎的 Twitter 帖文，並指「#FightForFreedom」、「#StandWithHongKong」反覆出現了數次，問黎當時是否留意到？黎稱沒有。黎其後稱，當時留意到帖文上有一些「藍色字形（blue figures）」，但是他並未有注意或閱讀它們。在法官追問下，黎稱理解那些「藍色字」只是名字，而他一向對名字不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎一直以來都知道李兆富將那些名字加在帖文中，並且非常清楚該些名字代表什麼。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎知悉香港避風港法案和香港人自由和選擇法&quot;&gt;控方：黎知悉《香港避風港法案》和《香港人自由和選擇法》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎於2020年7月17日的推文：「#HongKong #SafeHarborAct and #PeoplesFreedomandChoiceAct are good wherewithals to our resistance movement. Salute all former CGs and State Dept staff for caring about this place we call home.」（《香港避風港法案》和《香港人自由和選擇法》是我們反抗運動很好的本錢。向所有前總領事和美國國務院職員致敬，因他們在乎這個我們稱之為家的地方。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示同日黎與李兆富之間的 WhatsApp 對話，在推文發布之前，黎向李傳送《蘋果》英文版報導〈Former US top envoys call for Washington to grant Hongkongers political asylum〉，並提議字句：「This move is good wherewithal to our resistance movement. Thank you former counsel generals!（這舉動是我們反抗運動很好的本錢。感謝前總領事們！）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎早前主問時供稱不知道《香港避風港法案》（Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act）和《香港人自由和選擇法》（Hong Kong People’s Freedom and Choice Act）。控方今指，黎傳送給李的英文報導內文提及上述兩項法案，加上黎向李提議帖文字句。控方遂向黎提議，他當時其實知道法案，以及知悉法案內容。黎一概不同意，堅稱沒有仔細閱讀報導內文，也沒有留意兩項法案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認與攬炒巴劉祖廸和李宇軒等人協議請求外國實施制裁&quot;&gt;黎否認與「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和李宇軒等人協議請求外國實施制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出案情，黎在案發期間與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和李宇軒達成協議請求外國實施制裁。直至《國安法》生效之後，該協議仍然持續，直至陳梓華在2021年2月15日被拘捕。黎否認，並稱據他所知，他與陳梓華之間並沒有協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，SWHK 參與國際游說工作，包括請求外國針對中港實施制裁和敵對行動，為了促進上述協議。黎聲稱從不知協議存在，因此不同意。控方指，黎知道劉祖廸和李宇軒是 SWHK 的成員，也知道 SWHK 在2020年6月加入 IPAC 的中央秘書處。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，IPAC 自2020年6月成立起，持續參與游說針對中國實施制裁和敵對行動，而黎曾表達過支持陳梓華加入 IPAC。黎否認，又指陳編造證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎與陳梓華在2020年6月16日親身見面，在《國安法》生效之後，黎未有要陳不要再聯絡 Mark Simon，並停止國際游說。黎則反問：「我不知道他（陳）參與國際游說，我怎樣叫他停止？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳方安生晤美國副總統-黎吩咐張劍虹做到最大效果-同意屬編採指示&quot;&gt;陳方安生晤美國副總統 黎吩咐張劍虹「做到最大效果」 同意屬編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著就《蘋果日報》提問。黎早前供稱，除了指示員工「做大」前政務司司長陳方安生會見時任美國副總統彭斯的新聞，以及指示發動「一人一信救香港」之外，便沒有下達任何編採指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年3月特區政府推動《逃犯條例》修訂草案。同月23日，黎將前政務司司長陳方安生會見時任美國副總統彭斯的新聞，傳送給李永達、何俊仁、李卓人、時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹和時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏等人。黎並吩咐張劍虹：「大新聞，用它做到最大效果，謝謝。（Big news. Use it to maximum effect. Thanks, Jimmy）」張之後回覆「老闆，早安，收到。謝謝」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方盤問下，黎同意傳送給張劍虹和陳沛敏的訊息屬於編採指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;71佔立會後-黎向陳沛敏稱盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情改稱屬編採指示&quot;&gt;7.1佔立會後 黎向陳沛敏稱「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情」改稱屬編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月1日反修例示威者闖入立法會大樓。翌日，黎智英向前動新聞總監張志偉傳送訊息：「Nick，很好。年輕人衝（擊）立法會事（件）令我心情沈（沉）重，你們認為泛民善後工作有什麼該做令運動可以持續？好彩市民對年輕人闖立法院會是多少有些體諒，損害可能不太大。你們認為呢？謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後將上述訊息轉發給陳沛敏。陳回覆：「收到」，又表示已經發布了相關報導，「但無論如何明天再做。」黎回覆：「是，要再做。明天是否集中做年輕人的心聲，盡量為他們在這件事上爭取市民諒解和支持，得以平反？謝謝。」陳表示：「當然一定有些人不認同衝立會，但這些人也不會因此變成認同林鄭，我們明天會再做。謝謝。」黎接著稱：「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情，令指責他們的市民反省」等。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎訊息中的「平反」是指平反什麼？黎指那些示威者做了「可怕的事」，所以嘗試替他們平反。控方問，是否縱使出現暴力也好，黎也希望市民同情激進的示威者？黎則稱是想市民「理解」，因不想事件破壞當時的運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎早前主問時供稱，上述訊息是向陳沛敏「提議」而非給予編採指示。控方今再度問黎，這是否屬於下達給陳的編採指示？黎表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎籲陳報導大陸做生意的香港商人面對的危險-否認屬編採指示&quot;&gt;黎籲陳報導「大陸做生意的香港商人面對的危險」 否認屬編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年3月30日的訊息，黎向陳稱：「沛敏，今日頭條做得很好，只是沒有說做大陸新聞分分鐘被視為揭露國家機密，和批評中國政府文章會被標籤顛覆國家安全等罪名。但很好了。請繼續做在大陸做生意的香港商人面對的危險，嚇壞那些生意佬讓建制派不敢造次。謝謝。」陳回覆：「收到。商界有票，所以政府才稍微讓步，如果他們反對，政府就沒戲唱了」，黎回覆：「對，對付這些怕死鬼可能是我們絕招。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏早前供稱，理解上述訊息屬黎的指示。黎今否認：「我只是給予評語，不是編採指示。」控方又指，黎嘗試在香港市民間引起恐懼。惟黎否認，「我只是嘗試告知他們（修例的）危險性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及2019年3月27日，Mark Simon 向黎傳送訊息，引述郭明瀚指在「反送中」上扣連商界和法律界是很重要。控方指該訊息是在黎給予陳沛敏指示之前3天，質疑黎因為郭明瀚意見而指示陳沛敏報導商界面對的危險。黎則否認因為受到郭明瀚言論的影響而向陳沛敏給予指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎受訪稱倘修例傳媒冇得做-控方質疑修例與新聞自由沒有關係&quot;&gt;黎受訪稱「倘修例傳媒冇得做」 控方質疑修例與新聞自由沒有關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年4月1日的《蘋果》報導〈黎智英：倘修例傳媒冇得做〉，當中提及：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;壹傳媒集團創辦人黎智英昨日有參加民陣反修訂《逃犯條例》遊行，被問到上街原因時，黎說：「呢單嘢好緊要㗎大佬，呢單嘢過咗，我哋冇得做㗎！傳媒冇得做㗎！你話報道大陸新聞，佢（大陸政府）話你揭露國家機密；你批評佢，佢又話你顛覆國家安全，咁就冇㗎嘞，新聞自由依家少少都冇埋㗎喇」，呼籲香港人一定要盡量反對今次修例，「過咗死㗎呢單嘢，慘過23條啊！」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，修訂《引渡條例》與傳媒生意沒有任何關係。黎則重申，如果傳媒報導中國內地新聞會被視為「揭露國家機密」；又如果傳媒批評政府會被視為「顛覆國家安全」，這便會與傳媒非常有關係，又指修例後可能會被送往內地受審，並叫控方看看報導中浸大新聞系前助理教授杜耀明的說法。報導引述杜稱：「今次修例將嚴重打擊香港傳媒報道及評論新聞的自由，擔心不少新聞工作者都會不自覺地隨時跌入陷阱。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，修訂《引渡條例》與新聞自由完全無關。黎回應，表面上看是沒有關係，但是如果再看深一層，所衍生的後果（ramification）是會影響新聞自由。控方質疑這只是黎的感覺（perception）和揣測（speculation）。黎否認。控方繼續追問，這與揭露國家機密沒有關係。黎重申會影響新聞自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎提議，他針對中央政府作出沒有根據的指控，故意地蒙蔽事實及誤導公眾。黎否認。控方續指，黎意圖藉言論引起市民憎恨政府。黎則回應：「一派胡言。（Totally rubbish.）」控方追問，黎是同意還是不同意？黎回答不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方說：「黎先生，如果你能夠直接回答同意或不同意的話，可以節省到法庭時間。」黎則回應：「但是我需要說出同意或不同意的理由。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎藉文章談政府監控-與反修例無關-目的引起市民恐懼&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎藉文章談政府監控 與反修例無關 目的引起市民恐懼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示「成敗樂一笑」專欄文章〈請站出來保住最後防線〉，內容提到：「『引渡惡法』的作用，就像恐怖分子襲擊產生『可用性級聯』的效果，讓香港市民都被籠罩在恐慌的順民意識下，讓大陸無法無天的法律凌駕香港的司法制度⋯⋯現在大陸對人民的嚴苛監控，也會在我們膽怯噤如寒蟬下慢慢在香港推行。將來我們的身份證規定要儲存在手機裏，好讓政府利用附帶的軟件偵察我們的行蹤和行為，和手機內的通訊和通話。我們到處都會被臉部識別系統監控，甚至會像現時大陸人一樣，使用 WhatsApp、Facebook 和 Google 等也會被監管。匪夷所思？是，看似匪夷所思，但是這正是中央要推行『引渡惡法』的最終目標。修訂《逃犯條例》就是要摧毀『一國兩制』這個習帝的眼中釘，將香港與大陸看齊變成一國一制。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章提到：「修訂《逃犯條例》就是要摧毀『一國兩制』這個習帝的眼中釘⋯⋯是的，『引渡惡法』就是要讓中央的魔爪撕破《基本法》和一國兩制的最後防線，直搗香港社會核心價值的心臟。到時法治變成人治，權力變成了理據，貪贓枉法的大陸腐敗，將湧至成為香港正常的現象。人治就是純粹權力的統治，不僅巿民要在官字兩個口下委曲求全，在沒有法律保障下，所有巿場活動都會被權力支配，官員可以隨便扼殺任何一門生意，或放生任其自由發揮。做生意的人只好買官員的怕，尋求得到官員的保護而付出保護費，因此貪污違法將會成為香港無可避免的現象。」他於文末呼籲：「勇敢地站出來吧！請你們相信群眾的力量，加入今天反惡法的示威遊行吧！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指文章談及政府監控，然而修例與政府監控無關，質疑黎透過文章引起恐懼。黎否認，強調只是引述諾貝爾經濟學獎得主、心理學家 Daniel Kahneman 的說法，恐懼會導致人們做出不理性的行為，又指文章裡提及的嚴苛監控正在中國內地發生。控方質疑這只是黎的揣測。黎則回應這是他的合理推測，而且是基於諾貝爾經濟學獎得主的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提議，文章所述的是黎編造出來，目的只是引起恐懼。黎否認，稱：「我只是提醒讀者可能會發生什麼事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎想文章在讀者間產生「心理反應」，使他們會反對《引渡條例》修訂，又指黎有意引起讀者對政府的憎恨。黎否認，「我心裡從來沒有憎恨。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎向李柱銘稱我們應處處點火引發市民留意逃犯條例嚴重性&quot;&gt;黎向李柱銘稱「我們應處處點火引發市民留意逃犯條例嚴重性」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2019年5月29日，黎向李柱銘傳送訊息：「是否可以考慮包圍禮賓府，要求林鄭與市民或泛民對話。這不會廹（迫）得到她出來對話，但製造她縮龜不敢對話的大炮輿論。我們應處處點火引發市民留意逃犯條例嚴重性。有百多間學校師生抗議逃犯條例，社會關注很大。是否可動員各行各業都發表抗議聲明，例如醫學界，建築物界，運輸界，會計師界，甚至飲食界等。今晚談談。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否想動員各行各業抗議引渡條例，因此向李柱銘傳送上述訊息的目的是集合泛民引起市民留意及反對引渡條例？黎同意。控方又指根據，黎將相同訊息傳送給何俊仁、李卓人和李永達。法官李運騰一度問，訊息中的「點火」，應該不是按字面去理解？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎向陳提議修改區選海報使殘暴效果更大-否認屬編採指示&quot;&gt;黎向陳提議修改區選海報使「殘暴效果更大」 否認屬編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2019年11月16日，黎向陳沛敏傳送訊息：「沛敏，是否可以海報做長形些，看到警察身體較多，因而殘暴效果更大，請再給我看。謝謝。」陳傳送數張圖片給黎，標題均為「請投票止警暴」。黎評論：「對，感覺不是很暴力。」、「應該可以，我給他們看看再回覆你。同時請同事做一張他們認為暴力夠震撼的來看看。謝謝。」控方另展示黎與李卓人之間的對話，黎向李說：「好，我明天看了印製出來的真本再給你們意見後決定。謝謝。晚安！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎供稱不知道訊息中的海報是什麼、屬於誰人，當時陳徵詢他的意見，所以他作出評論，強調不是編採指示。法官李運騰問海報是否與新聞報導有關？黎稱不知道。控方問黎，以上訊息是否與區議會選舉有關？黎起初稱不知道，後來同意可能有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎指出，黎的訊息是向陳下達編採指示。黎否認，並指編採指示是關於「做什麼」，然而訊息是關於「怎樣提高質素」，因此不屬於編採指示。黎又提到自己曾經做過時裝生意。法官李素蘭問，與時裝生意有什麼關係？黎稱因為時裝牽涉審美，所以陳徵詢他的意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰則反駁，黎的訊息並非關於「提高質素」，而是提升「殘暴效果」。黎堅稱這是為了想要的目標，屬於提高質素，使陳的圖片有更佳效果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme included high-level speakers from more than 20 countries and covered topics including international law and norms, responsible use and development of tools and technologies – including AI – and the responsibility of states in conducting and responding to cyber operations and incidents. The event was part of RUSI’s ongoing Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour (GP-RCB) work. This initiative is dedicated to mapping practical understandings of responsible cyber behaviour (RCB) by conducting evidence-based research and connecting experts from different sectors and regions to reflect the diversity of views on the topic. Except for keynote speakers and the final discussion, we have not attributed panel speakers’ remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction-a-global-perspective-on-rcb&quot;&gt;Introduction: A Global Perspective on RCB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an increasingly volatile and interconnected global landscape, malicious activities within cyberspace present an ever-growing threat to international stability and security. From cybercrime and the misuse of emerging technologies to the proliferation of commercial hacking tools and state-sanctioned cyber operations, the challenge is multifaceted. Over the past two decades, governments worldwide have engaged in multilateral negotiations to develop norms that guide RCB. While progress has been made – as reflected in the 11 non-binding norms on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace reaffirmed by UN members in 2021 – difficulties remain in achieving international consensus on how responsibility is understood and operationalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an environment where influence and control lie beyond the sole purview of government authorities, a comprehensive, whole-of-society approach to RCB is necessary. This entails fostering cross-regional dialogue and multistakeholder collaboration to advance diverse, transparent and inclusive understandings of responsibility. This includes the need to widen global conversations on RCB to stakeholders beyond the state, in ways that reflect the many nuances of how and where responsibility is enacted. Key dimensions of this relate to how responsibility is understood internationally, domestically and operationally across different cultural, political and geographical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To promote debate and help foster a collective understanding of responsibility in cyberspace, the GP-RCB is focused on mapping practical understandings of RCB by conducting and delivering evidence-based research. It does this by connecting experts from different sectors and regions to reflect upon the diversity of views on the topic, providing an international platform that brings together more than 80 scholars, experts, think tanks and other academic institutions for dialogue, debate and research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inaugural Securing Cyberspace Conference, organised by RUSI and the GP-RCB, took place on 9 October 2024 at 61 Whitehall in London, convening global experts from academia, industry, government and civil society to explore challenges under the theme “Responsible Cyber Behaviour in Practice: A Global View”. Marking the first anniversary of the GP-RCB, the conference underscored the importance of diverse, inclusive dialogue in shaping the future of cyberspace governance. It aimed to bridge regional perspectives by connecting the research community, showcasing ongoing research, and facilitating insight on what RCB looks like across different operational contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-special-message-from-izumi-nakamitsu&quot;&gt;A Special Message from Izumi Nakamitsu&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the conference, RUSI received a “special message” from UN Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu that underscored the urgency of advancing global dialogues on RCB. In her message, Nakamitsu emphasised the importance of perseverance in face of geopolitical challenges, remarking that “Some may be tempted to conclude that the circumstances of the moment are not conducive to progress, but, in fact, it is precisely in moments like these that we must redouble our efforts in support of the framework for responsible state behaviour in the use of ICTs [Information and Communication Technologies].” The statement resonated with the overarching theme of SC2024, which saw experts address the complexities of advancing RCB in a world where political tensions and culturally divergent understandings of responsibility persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-conference-programme&quot;&gt;The Conference Programme&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference was made up of a mix of session formats. Following a ministerial opening, SC2024 began with two panels: one reflecting on the viability of multilateralism in advancing international cyber security commitments in an increasingly tense geopolitical context; and the other on state responsibility in the development of capabilities and conduct of cyber operations. Panel discussions were followed by workshops covering three dimensions of responsibility: international, domestic and operational. During the workshops, participants engaged with thought leadership, diverse perspectives and cross-sectoral collaboration to map diverse and practice-based understandings of RCB. The conference closed with a panel on innovative research and critical perspectives on ensuring RCB, which highlighted evolving work by GP-RCB researchers, and a “fireside chat” reflection on how to connect the discussion on responsible AI with cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-uk-view-of-rcb&quot;&gt;A UK View of RCB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Doughty MP, minister of state for Europe, North America and Overseas Territories in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, delivered the new government’s first speech on cyber security at SC2024. Doughty emphasised the critical importance of enhancing cyber security and fostering collaborative partnerships across UK sectors. He noted that “there is no national security, no economic security without cyber security”, underscoring the essential links between robust cyber measures and national stability. Acknowledging the increasing reliance on digital infrastructure in areas such as banking, healthcare and defence, the minister emphasised that, as “the stakes are higher than ever”, a unified response from all stakeholders is imperative, to counteract the escalating threats posed by state actors and criminal organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his address, the minister identified three key themes guiding the government’s approach to RCB: the necessity of partnerships; a commitment to RCB, including principles of transparency, inclusion and accountability; and the importance of a whole-of-society approach. He drew parallels with the successful collaboration that resulted in the cracking of the Enigma code during the Second World War, stating that “it’s only through solid, respectful, mutual, beneficial partnerships that we can fight back”, and emphasising how today’s cyber threats require unity. The minister underscored the need for transparency to build trust and facilitate cooperation, reflecting the UK’s aim of advancing responsibility through a holistic approach, fostering innovation, supporting underrepresented groups in technology, and engaging with global partners to combat cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;panel-1-fragmentation-or-like-mindedness-rethinking-rcb-in-the-age-of-minilateralism&quot;&gt;Panel 1: Fragmentation or Like-mindedness? Rethinking RCB in the Age of Minilateralism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UN negotiations on responsible state behaviour have provided an important framework for thinking about the applicability of international law in cyberspace, as well as creating a corpus of non-binding norms that can inform customary state practice. Notwithstanding such developments, current geopolitical divides and the elevation of cyber security within national security agendas have created a tense and protracted environment for the future of UN dialogues on this matter. In contrast to these larger forums, initiatives such as the Hiroshima Dialogue, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative and others have focused instead on promoting space for discussions of specific themes, and offering platforms for dialogue of the like-minded. In view of this, SC2024 invited government representatives and international experts to critically reflect on fragmentation and like-mindedness in global cyber security governance, specifically addressing the question of whether concrete discussions on RCB remain viable in an age of minilateralism – that is, in an age in which governments have sought to tackle international problems and pursue mutual goals in smaller groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-new-diplomatic-strategy&quot;&gt;A New Diplomatic Strategy?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel opened with a keynote address by James Lewis, Senior Vice President at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which focused on the evolving diplomatic cyber landscape, particularly in the context of great power competition. Lewis argued that the era of international cooperation on cyber norms, which “peaked” in 2015, has ended, with global relations now driven by rivalry among major powers such as the US, China and Russia. This shift, according to Lewis, means that “responsible state behaviour must be balanced against the realities of competition”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lewis emphasised that the fragmentation of the international system, driven by geopolitical realignments, has heightened tensions and disrupted progress on collaborative frameworks for cyberspace. He pointed to the absence of structured dialogues between major powers as a critical factor exacerbating this fragmentation. “There are no regular negotiations or agreed framework for talks between the United States and China, much less with Russia, as was the case in the Cold War,” he remarked, underscoring the challenges this poses for fostering stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical takeaway from Lewis’s keynote was the importance of governments creating new engagement strategies to manage the growing risks in cyberspace and its governance. Lewis advocated for a new democratic diplomatic strategy that accepts fragmentation but focuses on creating accountability and engagement strategies with both neutral and adversarial states. As he noted, “fragmentation, while unavoidable, can be managed to reduce the chance of conflict and to lay the foundation for a more secure future”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;panel-discussion&quot;&gt;Panel Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent panellists focused on providing insights into the different elements that shape governments’ decisions and incentives to engage in discussions on RCB. While panellists recognised the importance of multilateralism in fostering an inclusive platform where global voices can be heard – a sentiment embodied by institutions like the UN’s Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) – such frameworks also faced the criticism that they were slow and at risk of creating echo chambers. Specifically, one panellist raised the issue of there being a “bloc mentality” in multilateral fora, an issue that had prompted countries such as Brazil to not only call for confidence-building measures across political divides in the OEWG, but also support the establishment of a permanent mechanism for regular institutional dialogue on cyber security in the UN. This view echoed broader concerns that, without a unified approach, disparate initiatives between great powers could fracture global cyber governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minilateralism, on the other hand, was highlighted as indispensable for operationalising cyber security initiatives in diverse cultural and geographic regions. A panellist drew on Switzerland’s participation in the Pall Mall Process to counter the proliferation of commercially available cyber intrusion tools as an example of how smaller, focused coalitions can complement broader multilateral discussions. Panellists recognised that these coalitions allow for quicker action and sharper focus, especially in contexts where geopolitical divides slow down multilateral efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The African context added further nuance to the global conversation, with one participant highlighting how, despite African states recognising the value of multilateral platforms, there is growing sentiment that these forums often overlook regional priorities. The panellist specifically identified the need for a “Common African Position” on cyber norms, as a reflection of the continent’s desire for its priorities to be acknowledged, something that the rigid voting structures of international organisations often undermine. Similar conclusions were drawn by a panellist focused on RCB in the Indo-Pacific, which has seen India – in the absence of a pan-regional organisation in its vicinity – participate in various minilateral engagements including the Quad and the I2U2 Group. The panellist specifically identified geopolitical polarisation as a factor driving India’s foreign policy towards minilateral engagements, where a lack of understanding or sense of cooperation between major powers inhibits efforts towards global consensus building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than seeing these frameworks as being in competition, the panel recognised that they are mutually reinforcing: multilateralism provides the foundation for discussion and consensus building, while minilateralism drives practical outcomes. The added difficulty in this process, noted in the panel discussion, is the reconciliation of domestic responsibility with discussions at the international level. Emerging from the panel discussion was a reflection about the different levers of control and accountability that states have been trying to employ in attempting to enact responsibility amid growing fragmentation. This includes questions of how and when governments employ dual-use surveillance capabilities – such as the Intellexa Alliance capabilities proliferated across the EU – to legitimately address organised crime and other national security threats. An example of good practice, as highlighted by one participant, is the Swiss Act on Private Security Services Provided Abroad, adopted in 2013, which requires that companies intending to provide such services from Switzerland notify the relevant domestic authorities in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the panellists noted, the global cyber diplomatic landscape is marked by both multilateralism and minilateralism, with increasing geopolitical tensions amplifying the relevance of both global and regional frameworks to shaping RCB. The discussion concluded that the key will be in harmonising these frameworks to create a resilient and adaptable global cyber governance architecture, ensuring that wider conversations remain inclusive and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;panel-2-responsible-use-of-cyber-capabilities&quot;&gt;Panel 2: Responsible Use of Cyber Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development and use of cyber capabilities have become an integral part of cyber statecraft. Countries have devised specific organisations (cyber forces and cyber commands), sought to pass legislation to enhance the reach of cyber operations, and allocated more government funding to acquiring cyber tools to support a suite of strategic/operational objectives. The second panel of the day therefore brought together a group of researchers and experts to discuss how states have sought to reconcile state responsibility with the development of capabilities for conducting offensive cyber operations, as well as the core elements that should guide states’ use, acquisition and development of such tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;keynote-address-the-dilemmas-of-responsible-cyber-partnerships&quot;&gt;Keynote Address: The Dilemmas of Responsible Cyber Partnerships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This second panel was opened by investigative journalist Kim Zetter, whose keynote focused on the ethical and strategic dilemmas faced by liberal democracies in building and maintaining responsible cyber partnerships. Reflecting on the nearly 15 years since the discovery of the US-Israeli computer worm Stuxnet, Zetter highlighted the essential role of cyber capabilities in national security and foreign policy, while underscoring the lack of transparency involved. This relates to not only how states decide to deploy cyber tools to achieve their own objectives, but also what safeguards are in place to prevent their misuse by partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zetter raised critical questions about the international push for “responsibility” in cyber operations, questioning whose definition of responsibility prevails in a fragmented global landscape. She pointed out that while the US and its allies often condemn as irresponsible acts such as economic espionage, other states – notably China – see no distinction “between espionage for national security purposes and espionage to support the communist party’s socio-economic goals”. This divergence complicates efforts to establish shared norms, because – as Zetter noted – “nations that argue about the need for cyber norms are often reluctant to sign into agreements that would hamper their options for deploying capabilities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another central theme in Zetter’s address was the challenge of shared responsibility when liberal democracies assist partners in developing cyber capabilities. She pointed out that while the US and its allies frequently provide training and resources to other states, they often lack control over how these partners deploy their newfound capabilities. In challenging the audience to consider the ethical implications of providing capabilities to allies who may employ them in ways that diverge from democratic norms, Zetter asked whether “democratic states that design offensive cyber tools – and develop the skills and techniques for using them – have the right to dictate how other nations that they give them to use them”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zetter highlighted how wider national political interests can indirectly lead democracies to endorse surveillance practices that they would deem unacceptable at home. In her view, Israel’s granting of an export licence for the NSO Group’s Pegasus software to the UAE in the 2010s – a transaction that is widely viewed as having contributed to the UAE’s recognition of Israel’s sovereignty in 2020 – is an example of this. Zetter concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, when we talk about what kinds of operations we engage in that go too far, we also have to talk about what concessions we are willing to make that support the cyber operations of other nations. Where do we draw the limits of acceptable cyber behaviour for ourselves, and for those whose activities we enable and therefore tacitly endorse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;panel-discussion-1&quot;&gt;Panel Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel brought together experts to discuss how governments reconcile the use of offensive cyber capabilities with international norms and legal obligations. Central to discussions were the tensions between transparency, oversight and operational security, highlighting the growing complexity of defining “responsibility” in the development and use of cyber capabilities. The following themes were raised by panellists as they reflected upon how to define responsible use of cyber capabilities, and addressed the key elements that should guide states’ development of cyber tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transparency as a Cornerstone of Responsible Cyber Operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panellists agreed that transparency is essential to the responsible use of offensive capabilities. One participant noted how a significant shift has occurred in recent years. The use of such capabilities used often to be veiled in secrecy. The declassification in 2019 of the US cyber operation “Glowing Symphony” against Islamic State was cited as a pivotal moment of change, where a transparency initiative gave the international community a granular, detailed account of a state-conducted cyber operation for the first time. Marking a departure from the hyperbolic discourse surrounding the destructive potential of cyber actions, this type of openness – while challenging, owing to the need for operational security – was viewed by participants as crucial to building international confidence in states’ cyber behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measuring the Effects of Cyber Operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panellists also addressed the difficulties of measuring the effects of cyber operations, particularly in assessing unintended consequences. The complexity of cyber operations, combined with the often-blurred lines between state and non-state actors, complicates the evaluation of their impact. One panellist emphasised the importance of clearly defining “effects” of cyber actions in both operational and legal contexts to ensure accountability and adherence to international norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Role of International Law and Due Diligence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel acknowledged the importance of international law in governing state behaviour in cyberspace, while also recognising its limitations. There was consensus that while international law provides a foundational framework, its application remains more rhetorical than practical. A critical challenge highlighted was the lack of harmonised principles for accountability and attribution across the international community. The panel called for states to engage in the development of rigorous due diligence, both legally and operationally, to ensure that cyber actions remain within the bounds of international legal standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility to Act&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panellists also discussed how government inaction in cyberspace – as distinct from widespread worries relating to government action and offensiveness – can constitute a form of irresponsibility. The most capable states, some panellists argued, have an obligation to take initiative, to be persistently engaged, and to contest malicious cyber activity. By doing so, states help shape the norms and rules that govern cyberspace over time. This approach challenges the traditional defensive postures that many states have adopted, where responsibility is seen as primarily reactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-workshops-a-three-layered-approach-to-unpacking-rcb&quot;&gt;The Workshops: A Three-layered Approach to Unpacking RCB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reflect upon responsibility through different conceptual lenses and contexts, participants in SC2024 were given the opportunity to deep dive into their respective fields of expertise across three separate workshops. These workshops aimed to provide participants with a platform to inform the future GP-RCB international research agenda by engaging with thought leadership, diverse perspectives and cross-sectoral collaboration. Based on the core themes and reflections that the GP-RCB had identified in its first year of unpacking framings of responsibility, the workshops were divided into a three-layered approach to responsibility: the international, domestic and operational levels of governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;track-1-international--the-road-ahead-for-un-cyber-negotiations-post-2025&quot;&gt;Track 1: International – The Road Ahead for UN Cyber Negotiations Post 2025&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the second OEWG mandate concludes in 2025, the future of UN cyber negotiations faces considerable uncertainty. This workshop invited participants to reflect on challenges and opportunities for sustaining international dialogue on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Discussions explored geopolitical divides, proposals for post-2025 frameworks, and the role of multistakeholder collaboration in shaping effective governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OEWG Challenges and Limitations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions began by reflecting on the OEWG’s role as a platform for state dialogue on responsible behaviour in cyberspace. While participants acknowledged its contributions to maintaining discussions, they also identified a heavy focus on procedural aspects, rather than on achieving tangible outcomes. A recurring critique was the insufficient attention given to integrating international humanitarian law into discussions; participants argued that this gap limits the OEWG’s effectiveness in addressing pressing cyber-governance challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proposals for Post-2025 Mechanisms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uncertain future after the expiry of the OEWG’s mandate in 2025 prompted discussions on potential solutions to sustain international dialogue. A permanent Programme of Action (PoA) emerged as a prominent proposal, offering the prospect of merging existing parallel mechanisms, such as the OEWG and the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), into a streamlined and cohesive structure. Proponents argued that a PoA could reduce the inefficiencies of recurring negotiations, while fostering institutional stability and continuity in cyber governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Navigating Geopolitical Silos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants emphasised the difficulty of sustaining multilateral negotiations amid the increasing fragmentation of international relations. Geopolitical silos, marked by growing distrust and regional divisions, were seen as significant threats to progress on global cyber norms. Despite these challenges, there was consensus on the necessity of maintaining regular institutional dialogues to preserve minimal levels of trust and prevent the erosion of cooperative frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multistakeholder Approaches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key theme was the importance of broadening participation in cyber negotiations to include non-state actors. The inclusion of private sector representatives, civil society, and technical communities was highlighted as essential to capturing diverse expertise and perspectives. Such multistakeholder engagement was seen as a way to enhance the legitimacy of outcomes while addressing concerns that state-centric processes often overlook operational realities and broader societal impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust Building and Accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidence-building measures and other approaches to building trust were identified as critical to fostering confidence among states. However, participants noted that the absence of robust verification mechanisms in cyberspace governance undermines the effectiveness of such measures. Breaches of international law were seen as particularly damaging to long-term cooperation. Greater accountability – through clearer enforcement mechanisms and a focus on transparency – was presented as essential for establishing a stable and reliable framework for cyber norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;track-2-domestic--an-incident-responder-perspective-on-rcb&quot;&gt;Track 2: Domestic – An Incident Responder Perspective on RCB&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop shifted the focus from international norms to the critical domestic responsibilities of technical operators such as computer emergency response teams (CERTs) and national cyber security agencies. Participants examined how these responders contribute to whole-of-government efforts to counter irresponsible cyber activities, and reflected on the unique perspectives they bring to defining and implementing responsible behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Evolving Role of Incident Responders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop opened by highlighting how the field of cyber security has grown from addressing isolated vulnerabilities to dealing with challenges of broader societal significance. Participants observed that cyber attacks increasingly impact entire countries, with economic, political and national security implications. This shift underscores the need for incident responders to balance technical expertise with an understanding of larger strategic and legal frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legal Boundaries and Normative Principles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions emphasised the importance of ensuring that incident responders operate within defined legal and normative boundaries. CERTs, in particular, were seen as pivotal to upholding principles such as respect for national sovereignty while mitigating cyber threats. Participants highlighted that deeper training on international legal frameworks could enhance their ability to act responsibly and effectively, especially when managing cross-border incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attribution as a Collaborative Endeavour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attribution was identified as a complex task that requires a blend of technical analysis, intelligence sharing and diplomatic coordination. Participants shared lessons from past cases where attribution errors were corrected through collaboration among CERTs, intelligence agencies and other stakeholders. These examples demonstrated the value of multistakeholder partnerships in ensuring accurate and credible attributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addressing Domestic and Cultural Nuances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop explored how domestic values and circumstances shape approaches to RCB. In developing countries, motivations for adhering to international norms often align with economic development goals and digital transformation. In contrast, more developed nations may prioritise global influence and power dynamics. Participants noted that African countries often feel marginalised in global discussions, calling for greater inclusion and support in public–private partnerships. The need to balance cyber security with privacy rights was also highlighted as a key consideration in diverse domestic contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridging Policy and Technical Spaces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants identified the gap between high-level policy discussions and technical operations as a persistent challenge. A recommendation emerged for governments to facilitate regular meetings between senior authorities and technical responders, enabling alignment of cyber security operations with legal frameworks. Such initiatives could foster stronger collaboration, ensuring that policy decisions translate effectively into operational practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diverse Challenges in Operationalising Responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion concluded with an acknowledgment of the significant variability in national capacities and resources. While some countries have made progress in fostering collaboration among CERTs, private companies and governmental entities, others struggle to operationalise norms due to economic and infrastructural limitations. This disparity underscores the need for tailored approaches to implementing responsible cyber practices across different domestic contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;track-3-operational--designing-principles-for-responsible-cyber-operations&quot;&gt;Track 3: Operational – Designing Principles for Responsible Cyber Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session explored the guiding principles and doctrines for responsible cyber operations, moving beyond the growing institutional and technological capabilities states have developed for cyber competition. Participants focused on what operational norms and frameworks should inform states’ cyber activities, particularly in sub-threshold strategic contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beyond Legal Framing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the central tensions identified in the workshop was around the legal framing of responsibility. Participants noted that the conversation on responsibility often veers into overly legalistic discussions, focused primarily on adherence to international laws and norms, rather than on the intentions evident in operational behaviour. While adherence to international law is essential, an operational perspective on responsibility should also address recklessness and irresponsibility in cyber activities. This broader approach, according to its proponents, emphasises strategic oversight and the need to calibrate operations to avoid unintended consequences, tying actions to broader statecraft objectives, rather than to isolated missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proportionality and Necessity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principles of proportionality and necessity were underscored as cornerstones of responsible cyber operations. While these principles are derived from international law, their real-world application remains challenging, especially when operations risk affecting civilian infrastructure or infringing human rights. Participants stressed the need to differentiate between counter-force targeting and counter-value strategies, citing cases such as SolarWinds and NotPetya as examples of disproportionate and poorly calibrated operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transparency, Accountability and Oversight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of transparency and multilayered oversight was a recurring theme. Democratic states such as Canada and India were highlighted as examples of countries working to ensure that cyber operations align with principles of civilian control and oversight. Participants agreed that the key to achieving this balance lies in governments’ ability to manage multiple layers of authorisations for cyber campaigns. In the case of Canada, such a process involves the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Intelligence Commissioner working together to ensure a principled approach to the authorisation and oversight of cyber operations. However, participants noted that existing transparency mechanisms often fall short of addressing the strategic and campaign-level dimensions of cyber operations. Effective frameworks should integrate cyber operations into broader political and strategic contexts, rather than treating them as standalone actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corporate Responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of private companies in cyber operations was another critical discussion point. Technology and telecommunications firms often act as enablers or agents of state-sponsored operations, yet their accountability remains ambiguous. Participants emphasised the need for international principles that define the responsibilities of these actors and establish mechanisms to ensure they do not engage in reckless or irresponsible behaviour under the guise of state contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;responsible-ai-and-cyber-security&quot;&gt;Responsible AI and Cyber Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid expansion of generative AI models has heightened global interest in the disruptive implications of this technology to our societies, particularly regarding responsible and secure use. While AI has become integral to scaling cyber security solutions, discussions about responsible AI and RCB have often been siloed in separate communities. SC2024’s concluding fireside chat bridged this divide, featuring insights from Ollie Whitehouse, Chief Technology Officer at the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, and Ciaran Martin, Professor of Practice in the Management of Public Organisations at the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avoiding Alarmism and Maintaining Perspective&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central theme of the discussion was the need for a balanced approach to AI. Martin urged against sensationalist narratives, emphasising that responsible discourse requires avoiding exaggerated fears about AI’s potential for harm. He also highlighted that, unlike other industries, “the cyber security industry, for once – and very counter culturally given its history – has reacted to AI threats relatively calmly”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whitehouse echoed this sentiment, noting that while adversaries are leveraging AI to enhance traditional techniques such as vulnerability scanning and social engineering, these developments do not represent a fundamental shift in cyber threat dynamics. The industry’s challenge lies in monitoring and preparing for the scaling of AI threats without succumbing to hype. As Whitehouse explained, “there is something for us to be mindful about, and something to be prepared for as that scales, but the punchline is: AI for cyber good is the thing that we should fixate on, not AI for doom”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proliferation and Preparing for the Future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inevitability of AI’s proliferation was another key focus. Basic AI capabilities are expected to become widely accessible, including to malicious actors. According to Whitehouse, this reality requires the cyber security community to adopt proactive strategies to mitigate risks, while continuing to evolve defences. He noted that governments and private entities must collaborate to develop norms and regulations that promote responsible AI use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside institutional measures, cyber security professionals must adapt to adversaries’ evolving tactics. Both speakers highlighted the importance of fostering a culture of scepticism in relation to AI systems, teaching professionals and the public to critically evaluate AI outputs, rather than placing undue trust in them. In cyber security, this translates to ensuring that critical decisions remain under human oversight. AI can automate tasks and provide insights, but ultimate accountability must lie with humans, especially when national security is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrating AI into Cyber Security Frameworks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin emphasised the need to view AI and cyber security as interconnected parts of the same challenge, rather than as separate phenomena. Integrating AI into cyber security frameworks responsibly requires balancing the technology’s potential benefits against ethical considerations and the risks it poses. This approach includes retaining human judgement in decision-making processes, and ensuring that AI systems are tools rather than autonomous agents in critical security contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-future-of-gp-rcb-research&quot;&gt;The Future of GP-RCB Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SC2024 explored RCB in its international, domestic and operational dimensions, identifying key challenges and future directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the international level, discussions highlighted the persistent gap between the development of UN norms and their practical implementation, particularly in resource-constrained nations. Inclusive engagement, capacity building, and equitable partnerships were emphasised as essential for fostering global adherence to responsible principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, the role of technical actors such as CERTs was highlighted as central. Participants emphasised the need for robust legal understanding among responders, and stronger collaboration between policymakers and technical communities. Bridging the gap between policy and technical spaces was seen as critical to operationalising responsibility within national contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operationally, principles such as proportionality, necessity and accountability were identified as essential for responsible cyber operations. Participants called for greater transparency, strategic oversight, and accountability mechanisms, particularly in the involvement of private sector actors in state-directed cyber activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all tracks, the importance of three major themes emerged: bridging silos between disciplines; addressing the unique challenges of different national contexts; and strengthening collaboration between state and non-state actors. Discussions underscored the need for a holistic, integrated approach to RCB, encompassing legal, technical and operational considerations. The conference reflected a collective recognition that RCB requires a coordinated global effort, underpinned by consistent dialogue, inclusive governance and a strategic approach to tackling the evolving cyber threat landscape. These reflections will inform future research and engagement as part of the GP-RCB and wider research community, highlighting the necessity of a forward-thinking, collaborative framework to navigate the complexities of cyber security in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

This edited volume offers comprehensive analysis and recommendations to create resilient supply chains for national, economic, and energy security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safeguarding the minerals supply chains for advanced technologies in strategic industries is an economic and national security imperative. Yet significant vulnerabilities continue to exist in the supply chain, despite the ongoing efforts by government and businesses to address them. Policymakers now face the immense task of fortifying supplies of everything from lithium and graphite for advanced battery chemistries to tungsten and rare earth elements for the next generation of warfighting technologies. The United States will need to strengthen both its mission clarity and its execution with a comprehensive strategy focused on domestic resource development, advanced processing and recycling technologies, international partnerships, and sustainable practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edited volume brings together the analysis and policy recommendations of 15 experts, led by editors Dr. Gracelin Baskaran and Dr. Duncan Wood, to bolster U.S. competitiveness and leadership in these areas. It is intended to be a resource for policymakers in the new U.S. administration and Congress. The volume shows that resilient mineral chains have never been more important for U.S. security than at this critical juncture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;gracelin-baskaran&quot;&gt;Gracelin Baskaran&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining is an inextricable part of the American story. What starts as rock in the ground goes on to become the inputs that build America’s homes and buildings, transportation systems, energy generation and transmission, defense systems, and technological capabilities. Mining is the foundation that allowed the United States to be a military leader, providing the minerals needed to manufacture tanks, missiles, fighter jets and warships. It is the reason computers, phones, and iPads exist. Mining is the reason we have energy and can turn on lights every morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States is 100 percent import reliant for 12 of the 50 minerals identified as critical by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and over 50 percent import reliant for another 29. China is the top producer for 29 of these critical minerals. This dominance is the result of decades of minerals-centered domestic industrial strategy and foreign policy. China has repeatedly shown its willingness to weaponize these minerals. Over the last two years, China has rolled out export restrictions, including complete bans, on antimony, gallium, germanium. Furthermore, China has a stranglehold on minerals processing, refining between 40 and 90 percent of the world’s supply of rare earth elements, graphite, lithium, cobalt, and copper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reducing reliance on China and creating resilient mineral supply chains is one of the most bipartisan priorities in Washington, D.C. This is demonstrated by the efforts of the last two administrations. In 2017, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13817, intending to improve the management of critical minerals needed for economic prosperity and energy security. In 2021, President Joe Biden issued Executive Order 14017, which led to a review of U.S. critical minerals and material supply chain vulnerabilities. The assessment released by the Biden administration discovered that the overreliance on adversarial countries posed a threat to national and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geopolitical tension and war have motivated the advancement of critical minerals policies for nearly a century. At the start of World War II, the United States adopted the Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpiling Act of 1939. In his letter to Congress, President Franklin D. Roosevelt noted both that commercial stocks of vital raw resources in the United States were low and that “In the event of unlimited warfare on sea and in the air, possession of a reserve of these essential supplies might prove of vital importance.” By 1942, non-essential gold mining was restricted by the U.S. government so that it could free up mining companies’ capacity to focus on more critical minerals needed for the war effort. Less than a decade later, the Defense Production Act of 1950 was passed in response to the Korean War and provided authority for allocations to source strategic minerals needed to manufacture defense technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

The derived work is not endorsed by the IEA in any manner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While conflict and uncertainty have been the biggest drivers of advancing policies to build secure minerals supply chains, demand for minerals has largely been driven by industrialization, technological advancements, decarbonization, and economic growth. For example, in 1975, the United States required that catalytical convertors be installed into automobiles to reduce emissions. These catalytic convertors drove the long-term demand of platinum group metals and have single-handedly made American air cleaner and more breathable, reducing harmful exhaust gases from automobiles by over 90 percent. Copper is another example. It is a necessary material for many of the advanced technologies that are essential to the modern global economy, including in infrastructure, clean energy, electronics, and automotives, and copper wires connect electrical grids, integrated circuits, and telecommunications systems. In order to meet net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, annual copper supply would need to double by 2035. The artificial intelligence (AI) industry is putting additional pressure on copper demand. The data centers that process AI applications could demand up to 200,000 metric tons of copper per year between 2025 and 2028, adding another 2.6 million metric tons to the copper deficit in 2030. Copper reached its highest ever price—$11,000 per metric ton—on the London Stock Exchange in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technologies advance and become cleaner, and as demand for them grows, the mineral needs of the U.S. economy intensify. The competitiveness of the U.S. domestic automotive, energy, technology, and defense industries will be key to determining the United States’ standing as an economic powerhouse and global superpower in the decades ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will need to strengthen both its mission clarity and its execution. At present, the U.S. government has yet to agree on a single critical minerals list. Because copper is not on the USGS list, it has been ineligible for investment incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Additionally, there is no centralized agency or department to coordinate mining activities or execute a strategy. There are 15 government departments and agencies working on critical minerals, including the Departments of the Interior, Commerce, Energy, Defense, State, Labor, Homeland Security, Treasury, Agriculture, and Education; the Export-Import Bank; the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation; the U.S. Agency for International Development; the Environmental Protection Agency; and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The Bureau of Mines, which was initially opened in 1910 to coordinate all mining activities, was closed in 1996 and never reopened. Most of these departments and agencies are working on their own critical minerals efforts, with little interagency collaboration. Ultimately, strengthening coordination within the U.S. government must be a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book has three sections. Section 1 provides an evaluation of the critical minerals needs of four vital industries—semiconductors, defense, electric vehicles, and renewable energy—and provides recommendations for strengthening the resilience of these supply chains. Section 2 evaluates key Biden-era initiatives related to minerals supply chains—the IRA, CHIPS and Science Act, Defense Production Act, and the Minerals Security Partnership—and provides recommendations for reforming. The final section provides an analysis of key issues—domestic permitting, building midstream processing capacity, commercial diplomacy for minerals, deep sea mining, responsible mining, and government coordination—and provides concrete recommendations for how the United States can strengthen its performance in these areas to be a competitive and credible global leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crucial-industries-rely-on-critical-minerals-to-remain-competitive&quot;&gt;CRUCIAL INDUSTRIES RELY ON CRITICAL MINERALS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safeguarding the supply chains for advanced technologies in strategic industries is an economic and national security imperative. Policymakers now face the immense task of fortifying supplies of everything from lithium and graphite for advanced battery chemistries to tungsten and rare earth elements for the next generation of warfighting technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the first part of this book delves into the mineral needs of four key industries to U.S. economic competitiveness: semiconductors, defense, automobiles, and renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;semiconductors&quot;&gt;Semiconductors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semiconductors are foundational to virtually every part of modern life, powering technologies that drive innovation, connectivity, and efficiency. They are used in smartphones, computers, military applications, medical devices, and automotives. Semiconductors are mineral intensive—small but essential quantities of gallium, germanium, palladium, silicon, arsenic, titanium, and other elements are needed to produce the array of semiconductors required for such diverse applications. The production of these resources is largely concentrated in foreign adversaries, exposing a severe national security risk. USGS has estimated that just a 30 percent supply disruption of gallium could cause a $602 billion decline in U.S. economic output, amounting to a 2.1 percent loss of gross domestic product (GDP)—a significant economic impact. Semiconductor supply chains will not be secure until the necessary mineral supply chains are secured. In Chapter 2, Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz assess the minerals needs of the semiconductor industry and provide recommendations on developing appropriate incentives and leveraging research and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-industry&quot;&gt;Defense Industry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minerals are the bedrock of the defense industry. They are used in a wide array of defense applications, including military weapons systems, ammunition, and aerospace technologies. China is rapidly investing in munitions and advanced weapons systems, acquiring new systems roughly five to six times more quickly than the United States. While China is operating with a wartime mindset to enhance military readiness, the United States has maintained a peacetime approach. Even before new restrictions, the U.S. defense industrial base struggled with insufficient capacity and surge capability to meet production demands for defense technologies, many of which are highly minerals intensive. Restrictions on critical mineral supplies will further widen the gap, enabling China to advance its capabilities more effectively than the United States. In Chapter 3, Matt Zolnowski describes Department of Defense (DOD) actions to mitigate critical minerals vulnerabilities and advises how the department can update war-planning assumptions and stockpiling programs to prepare for a future crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: U.S. Import Reliance on China by Mineral Type (as Percent of Consumption).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: USGS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electric-vehicles&quot;&gt;Electric Vehicles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric vehicles (EVs) are a major driver of innovation in the auto industry and are shaping the future of mobility. While the EV industry is important for the clean energy transition, it is also of vital importance to the U.S. economy. Domestic automakers began the commercial production of hybrid EVs in 1997. They have spent decades investing in the development of the EV industry. EV investments in the United States over the last nine years reached $199 billion and created 201,900 EV-related jobs. By June 2024, automotive manufacturing jobs reached their highest levels since 1990. EVs require significant quantities of minerals. While a traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) requires an average of 32 kg of critical minerals, an EV needs an average of 210 kg—over a six-fold increase. Therefore, the domestic auto industry now faces the daunting task of sourcing minerals from reliable and responsible partners amid a shifting policy landscape and swiftly evolving battery technologies. In Chapter 4, Duncan Wood and Alexandra Helfgott look at EV trends in the United States, assess the battery landscape, and examine how the United States should provide support to sustain an innovative and competitive domestic EV industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewable-energy&quot;&gt;Renewable Energy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewable energy technologies will be key to unlocking new, cleaner sources of energy. In the United States, wind and solar together provide 15 percent of electricity generation, with both sectors poised for substantial growth. In 2023, there was $248 billion in clean energy investments. This is over a three-fold increase from 2018. Today, the renewable energy industry employs 8 million people in the United States. Southern states have been the biggest beneficiaries of clean energy investments, receiving $428 billion between the first quarter of 2018 and second quarter of 2024, followed by Western states ($327 billion), Midwestern states ($149 billion), and Northeastern states ($90 billion). While this renewable energy buildout promises greater energy security, lower costs, and reduced emissions, it will depend heavily on secure mineral supplies. Wind farms and utility-scale solar facilities require far more mineral inputs than conventional power plants. Both technologies rely on critical minerals for their advanced electronics and components. In Chapter 5, Joseph Majkut highlights two materials especially imperiled due to rising demand and a lack of supply chain diversification—rare earth elements and polysilicon—which are essential for wind and solar power, respectively. China currently dominates the supply chains for both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-2&quot;&gt;SECTION 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;progress-under-the-biden-administration&quot;&gt;PROGRESS UNDER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Important but Incomplete&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Washington has come to the realization that crucial U.S. industries and technologies are reliant on supply chains that are heavily concentrated in foreign adversaries, namely China. Advanced semiconductors designed in the United States are being manufactured and packaged in Taiwan. American automakers are producing EVs using Chinese battery chemistries. Domestically produced solar panels are made with Chinese solar cells and polysilicon. Over the course of decades and with the assistance of state-led industrial policies and billions of dollars in subsidies, China has grown to dominate the manufacturing sector for the cutting-edge technologies that the modern economy relies on. The risk this poses to U.S. national and economic security is untenable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, diversifying supply chains and boosting American manufacturing and ingenuity was a central objective of the Biden administration. To achieve these goals, President Biden enacted major pieces of legislation like the IRA and the CHIPS and Science Act, invoked the DOD’s Defense Production Act to boost the industrial base, and initiated the Department of State’s Mineral Security Partnership to further international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These policy measures have been impactful in stimulating private sector investment as well as changing the narrative in policy circles around what qualifies as a strategic industry and what the role of government should be in securing supply chains. But these policy measures also have some significant gaps when it comes to the upstream mining and minerals industries. The new administration will be tasked with determining how these initiatives under the Biden administration can be modified, improved, and strengthened to better fit the mining industry’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;inflation-reduction-act&quot;&gt;Inflation Reduction Act&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA is the Biden administration’s flagship climate initiative, providing unprecedented levels of government incentives in the form of tax credits, grants, and loan guarantees for the clean energy industry. The bill includes provisions designed to address the entire circular clean energy supply chain, from the production of lithium and graphite to the manufacturing of EV batteries and wind turbines to the recycling and recovery of materials from end-use technologies. While the IRA has driven unprecedented investment in clean energy supply chains, sourcing critical minerals remains a critical limitation. In Chapter 6, Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz score the IRA on how well it has achieved its objectives thus far and give recommendations as to how the minerals-related provisions may be altered and expanded upon to better meet the needs of industry and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chips-and-science-act&quot;&gt;CHIPS and Science Act&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act, signed into law in August 2022, was an amalgamation of a number of legislative efforts to address both a rising China and the United States’ desire to firm up access to semiconductors following the pandemic supply chain shock that froze consumer access to a wide range of products. Although this bill addressed a wide range of science and technology areas relevant to U.S. competitiveness, it did not prioritize securing American access to critical minerals. As a result, the CHIPS Act’s focus on critical minerals access is minor, with the majority of funding going toward research and development for chip innovation, workforce development programs, and, above all, attracting investment in semiconductor fabrication, assembly, testing, and advanced packaging. Congress needs to act to explicitly address minerals relevant to semiconductor production, as they have for minerals used for EVs and clean tech. In Chapter 7, Kellee Wicker analyzes the impacts and shortcomings of the CHIPS Act and provides recommendations for strengthening the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-production-act&quot;&gt;Defense Production Act&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration also invoked the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 to secure critical minerals for the defense industrial base. The DPA authorizes the president to ensure the availability of U.S. and Canadian industry for U.S. defense, essential civilian, and homeland security requirements. DPA Title III, Expansion of Productive Capacity and Supply, includes incentives for the DOD to develop, maintain, modernize, and expand production capacity or critical technologies. DPA Title III funds cannot be used if other funding (e.g., private investment or funding from other agencies) can be secured. Given the private sector’s reluctance to make investments in critical minerals projects due to market price volatility for these materials, the DPA has proven to be a vital financing mechanism. In Chapter 8, Christine Michienzi details how the DPA has been used so far to support the critical minerals industry in the United States and Canada and gives recommendations as to how the new administration can best leverage the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;minerals-security-partnership&quot;&gt;Minerals Security Partnership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) is a multilateral State Department initiative uniquely focused on minerals security. Since its inception in 2022, the MSP has mobilized a coalition of market-led democracies, primarily Western developed nations, with India as the only developing nation with membership. By 2024, the MSP supported nearly 30 minerals projects around the world and has brought additional mineral-rich countries to the table in the MSP Forum. But many unknowns and questions still remain as to how efficacious the MSP is and how it endures in a new administration. In Chapter 9, Jane Nakano suggests several modifications to the MSP that could accord more dynamism and long-term durability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addressing-challenges-and-outstanding-questions-in-the-critical-minerals-industry&quot;&gt;ADDRESSING CHALLENGES AND OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS IN THE CRITICAL MINERALS INDUSTRY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minerals industry faces a number of unique challenges that policymakers must address in the coming years if they wish to substantially shift mineral supply chains and improve U.S. industry’s access to non-Chinese mineral sources. The third part of this volume delves into some of the biggest issues and questions facing the industry, from how to expedite the domestic mine permitting process to whether deep sea mining is the future of minerals extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;domestic-permitting&quot;&gt;Domestic Permitting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining is the first step in the critical minerals supply chain, yet permitting a mine is a major hurdle in domestic critical mineral production that has yet to be overcome. On average, it takes 29 years to build a mine in the United States, the second-longest time in the world. Obtaining permission to operate a mine in the United States today involves securing federal, state, and local permits. A project can require up to 30 permits, many of which are duplicative. Policymakers on both sides of the aisle are calling for a modernized permitting system that facilitates the development of domestic mining projects. In Chapter 10, Morgan Bazilian and Gregory Wischer review the history of permitting policy in the United States and provide actionable policy solutions to streamline the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-processing-and-refining-capacity&quot;&gt;Building Processing and Refining Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next stage of mineral production, also known as the midstream, mined mineral ore must be processed and refined into the high-purity metals and materials used in end products. This stage of the supply chain is where China truly dominates. The dependence on Chinese processing creates strategic vulnerabilities, exposing the United States to potential supply disruptions due to geopolitical tensions, export restrictions, and price manipulations. To reduce these risks and bolster national security, it is essential to enhance U.S. midstream processing capabilities. In Chapter 11, Adam Johnson explains the importance of building domestic mineral processing capacity and provides recommendations on developing the workforce, leveraging strategic reserves, and streamlining permitting to accelerate the development of midstream capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-engagement&quot;&gt;International Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 30 years, China has emerged as a key player in mineral supply chains through strategic international engagement. Although it produces only 10 percent of the world’s lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper, China imports sufficient quantities to process 65 to 90 percent of the global supply of these metals. This dominance is the result of years of industrial planning and foreign policy initiatives from Beijing. Given the United States’ limited domestic reserves—including less than 1 percent of the world’s reserves of commodities such as cobalt, nickel, and graphite, and less than 2 percent of manganese and rare earth elements—it must develop a strategy to reduce its dependence and enhance its mineral supply security. In Chapter 12, Gracelin Baskaran provides a novel framework for determining which international partners to prioritize and gives recommendations for how policymakers should engage in commercial diplomacy. These efforts should prioritize financing minerals security needs, leveraging soft power through infrastructure development and geological mapping, and developing carrots and sticks to drive market-based activity aligned to U.S. government interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deep-sea-mining&quot;&gt;Deep Sea Mining&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While today’s EVs and semiconductors are manufactured with minerals from land-based mines, this may not always be the case. Minerals that are found in nodules at the depths of the ocean, including manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt, offer immense untapped resource potential. However, the environmental impacts of extraction from these sources remain largely unknown, and a set of international regulations has yet to be finalized. Still, China continues to make strides in developing the necessary technologies and exploration licenses to capture deep sea resources first. In Chapter 13, Seaver Wang provides insight into the status of the deep sea mining industry and the opportunity to change the calculus around mineral supply chains by expanding tax incentives to cover minerals mined from the sea, strengthening support to seafloor minerals research to improve environmental management approaches, and providing financing to strategic demonstration projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;responsible-mining&quot;&gt;Responsible Mining&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining is an industry with a complicated, and often negative, reputation due to all-too-frequent incidents of environmental degradation, human rights violations, social unrest, and devastating workplace accidents. Therefore, responsible mining standards are a nonnegotiable to ensure that U.S. and allied mines operate under best practices. As a major consumer and increasingly important producer of mined materials, the United States has a critical role in promoting responsible mining practices. In Chapter 14, Rohitesh Dhawan offers insight into how permitting reform can be done in a way that promotes responsible mining practices and advantages projects that follow high standards, how responsible mining standards can be used as a criterion for public procurement of metals or metal-based products, and how green premiums can be leveraged to financially incentivize responsible mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minerals policy has shifted quite significantly since 2010. The Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations all approached the critical minerals challenge based on their respective times and the policy tools at their disposal. America has learned much from these experiences. Reflecting on those experiences, Frank Fannon provides a suite of recommendations in Chapter 15 for the new administration to retake the commanding heights of the new economy: developing a single point of accountability to oversee and coordinate the administration’s multiple lines of minerals policy efforts, reforming financing tools such as the DFC and Export-Import Bank (EXIM), undertaking permitting reform, and eliminating provisions that allow firms with any Chinese ownership from receiving taxpayer subsidies. Successful action will require an “all-of-the-above” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;looking-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mission we undertook in compiling this book was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the indispensable role critical minerals play in the modern economy’s most strategic industries, and to more fully understand and address the vulnerabilities the United States faces in securing the minerals upon which it so clearly depends. Furthermore, this volume is rich in policy proposals for the new administration, laying out a path forward for the most pressing challenges facing the critical minerals supply chain, from extraction to processing and refining to end use. These challenges are real and profound and require urgent attention—but as the chapters in this book demonstrate, they are not insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The success of the Western semiconductor industry depends on reliable access to the critical minerals that are responsible for continuous advancements in the industry.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semiconductors are the fundamental building blocks of modern technology, necessary for everything from smartphones and laptops to communications and energy-storage systems to military and aerospace applications. These integrated circuits are called “semiconductors” due to being partial conductors, a unique property that enables them to control the flow of electrons by acting as both conductors and insulators. Therefore, semiconductors rely on small but essential quantities of specific minerals with these properties to function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silicon, gallium, and germanium are the most common semiconductor materials used to form wafers, with different chip applications calling for different materials. However, a myriad of other critical minerals come into play during the manufacturing stages and doping process—in which additional metals are introduced to slightly alter the chip’s conductivity—to create just one integrated circuit. Palladium, arsenic, iridium, titanium, copper, and cobalt are just some of the additional minerals that are necessary for semiconductor plating, wiring, doping, and packaging during production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical minerals most central to semiconductor production have high-risk supply chains largely concentrated in China. China produces 98 percent of the world’s refined gallium and controls 68 percent of refined germanium production, 79 percent of the world’s silicon, 40 percent of its arsenic trioxide, and 67 percent of its titanium. The United States, meanwhile, is reliant on imports to access the materials needed for high-performance semiconductors. In 2022, the United States produced no arsenic, no gallium, less than 2 percent of the world’s refined germanium, 3 percent of its silicon, and less than 1 percent of its titanium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concentration of global critical minerals supply chains in the hands of adversaries presents a major security challenge for Western chipmakers. The chance of prolonged and widespread supply disruptions for semiconductor minerals is high, as China has already demonstrated its ability to restrict the flow of key minerals in the global economy. In July 2023, China announced export restrictions on gallium and germanium. A year and a half later, China cut off the United States from Chinese gallium and germanium entirely through complete export bans on these materials targeted specifically at the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semiconductor industry is too central to U.S. economic and national security to allow such an evident vulnerability in its supply chain. To truly secure the Western semiconductor industry, policymakers should address mineral supply chain vulnerabilities, not just vulnerabilities in downstream chip manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-minerals-to-advance-semiconductor-technology&quot;&gt;THE IMPORTANCE OF MINERALS TO ADVANCE SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical minerals necessary for semiconductor production hold the key to furthering innovation in the industry. A concept commonly known as Moore’s Law stipulates that the density of a semiconductor (i.e., the number of transistors that can fit on a 1-square-inch microchip) will continue to rise every year, equating to more computing power, higher speed, and more complex applications. For decades, silicon has been the wafer material of choice for most semiconductors due to its abundance in nature and thermal stability, making it a cheaper choice well suited to the early electronics industry. However, silicon alone may be close to reaching the physical limits of Moore’s Law. Rather, gallium and germanium are essential additions and alternatives to unlocking more advanced chipmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium and germanium have certain advantages over silicon that make them ideal materials for increasingly advanced semiconductors. Germanium’s high electron mobility allows it to conduct electrons nearly three times faster than silicon, translating into faster device performance. Semiconductors with germanium channels, known as complementary metal–oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, are used today for quantum computers. Gallium similarly offers greater conductive potential for higher power density and energy efficiency. High-performance chips made with gallium nitride (GaN) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) are used in advanced defense applications from satellite communications to missile detection systems. Production of GaN chips is expected to grow more than 25 percent annually through 2030, with defense applications driving this increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium and germanium are indispensable materials for the future of the semiconductor industry. But with current supply chain challenges and no U.S. sourcing alternatives, these materials are increasingly difficult to obtain. The next generation of chipmaking requires policymakers to devise and execute a critical minerals strategy that ensures the industry will have a reliable supply of needed materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mineral-sourcing-challenges&quot;&gt;MINERAL SOURCING CHALLENGES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium and germanium are especially rare in the Earth’s crust, at only 19.0 and 1.6 parts per million (ppm), respectively. Copper, in comparison, is estimated at 60 parts per million. These concentrations of minerals are too widely dispersed to be recovered directly from the Earth. Rather, the only economically viable way to source gallium and germanium is to recover them as byproducts from the mining and processing of other minerals. Gallium is sourced from bauxite ores through aluminum smelting, and germanium is primarily recovered from zinc smelting. Even so, less than 10 percent of the gallium in bauxite and 5 percent of the germanium in zinc can be recovered. These materials must then go through a complex refining process to produce gallium and germanium at the needed purity levels of over 99.99 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has several advantages in gallium and germanium sourcing. The country has rich zinc deposits and imports 75 percent of the world’s bauxite due to its leading aluminum industry. This access to feedstock has also positioned China well to lead in germanium and gallium recovery. Aided by government subsidies, Chinese firms were able to flood the market with mineral oversupply in the 2010s. As prices dropped, Western competitors could not remain economically viable, allowing China to emerge as the world leader in semiconductor minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the United States has small bauxite reserves of 20 million tons (less than 1 percent of global totals) and limited zinc reserves of 76.6 million tons (3 percent of global totals). The country currently has limited mining activity and produces only small amounts of germanium from zinc deposits in Alaska and smelting operations in Tennessee. Some new domestic projects may be in the works: In 2023, Dutch company Nyrstar announced a $150 million investment to expand its existing zinc operations in Tennessee to add a gallium and germanium processing facility. However, the project has yet to secure investor funding, and the company has faced market challenges that led it to temporarily suspend zinc mining operations in October 2023. In the near term, domestic investments will evidently not be enough to secure gallium and germanium supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. allies and strategic partners will be key to sourcing bauxite and zinc and producing gallium and germanium. For example, although Australia is the top producer of bauxite and home to the largest zinc reserves in the world, it lacks midstream processing capacity, leading it to send over 50 percent of its zinc exports and 97 percent of its bauxite exports to China. And Peru, a U.S. free trade partner with the largest zinc smelting plant in Latin America, currently produces no germanium or gallium. Australia and Peru hold vast potential for alternative gallium and germanium sourcing for the semiconductor industry, but without investment by Western firms into midstream processing and refining, these resources will remain untapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-chips-and-science-act&quot;&gt;THE CHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But What About the Critical Minerals?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2020, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the United States experienced firsthand how debilitating semiconductor shortages can be. An estimated 169 sectors and consumer lines were impacted by semiconductor supply disruptions, including the electronic, automotive, communications, and healthcare industries. As a result, Western firms faced lower production volumes, the cancellation of new product lines, and delayed breakthroughs in technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Policymakers realized just how fragile current semiconductor supply chains are, due to a highly complex and specialized production process largely concentrated in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2022, President Joe Biden signed the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act into law, with the goal of strengthening U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and supply chains. This act included over $280 billion in support for advanced chip manufacturing, packaging, and workforce development. To address the supply chain vulnerabilities experienced during the pandemic, the bill focused on onshoring downstream capabilities, including by developing fabrication facilities for legacy chips used in communications and defense applications. The legislation also introduced significant government grant funding, which has been awarded to companies such as Intel and Micron to enable them to build and expand their chip-manufacturing capacity. However, the CHIPS Act overlooked a major national security vulnerability in semiconductor supply chains: critical minerals. The bill did not include any provisions to incentivize the diversification of critical minerals supply chains for semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;export-restrictions-highlight-supply-chain-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;EXPORT RESTRICTIONS HIGHLIGHT SUPPLY CHAIN VULNERABILITIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States quickly realized just how big an oversight the exclusion of critical minerals from the CHIPS Act was. On August 1, 2023, Chinese export restrictions on gallium and germanium went into effect in retaliation for Washington banning exports of advanced semiconductor technologies to China. Due to the restrictions, gallium and germanium exporters in China are now required to apply for an export license for each shipment of material, providing the government with details on the overseas buyer and end use. Beijing justified the escalation of the tech war by claiming that such measures were necessary for national security. Meanwhile, the Western semiconductor industry was paying the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August and September 2023, China exported no refined gallium and only 1 kg of refined germanium, compared to nearly 8,000 kg and 6,900 kg, respectively, in the preceding July. In total, China’s gallium exports for 2023 were over 50 percent lower than exports for 2022; as of February 2024, gallium exports had yet to return to pre-restriction levels, and it remains unclear when China’s exports will return to their previous peaks. Continued restrictions and the implementation of gallium and germanium export bans in January 2025 will have a significant effect on the U.S. economy. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has estimated that a disruption to just 30 percent of gallium supply could cause a $602 billion drop in U.S. economic output, equivalent to 2.1 percent of gross domestic product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices for these materials have risen markedly over the past year. In April 2024, gallium prices were at their highest level since 2011. Assessed prices for gallium have nearly doubled since the restrictions were imposed, and germanium prices have also climbed over 70 percent, to $2,280 per kilogram. China has demonstrated its ability to control the materials market for semiconductors and has only tightened U.S. access to these materials with newly implemented exported bans. Continued and additional bottlenecks in critical minerals supply present an ongoing threat to the resilience of the U.S. semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating Better Policy for Semiconductor Mineral Supply Chains&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS and Science Act, as well as the current policy focus on downstream chip manufacturing, will not be enough to secure semiconductor supply chains. As long as China controls critical minerals supply chains, the U.S. semiconductor industry will be vulnerable to export restrictions, bottlenecks, and price volatility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One policy recommendation that is frequently cited as a solution to shortages of base metals is to revamp government stockpiling efforts through the National Defense Stockpile under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act of 1939. The United States currently stockpiles no gallium and only about 14,000 kg of germanium, or half of the country’s annual consumption. However, stockpiling semiconductor metals to address critical minerals supply chain vulnerabilities will be challenging due to their price volatility and the small quantities needed for the industry (relative to the electric vehicle industry, for example, which requires significant quantities of base metals). In addition, gallium has a shelf life of only around one year due to its low melting point. Stockpiling efforts are therefore not the best solution to addressing supply chain concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the United States should consider the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in building the technological know-how for gallium and germanium refining.&lt;/strong&gt; Refining these minerals to needed purity levels of over 99.99 percent for the semiconductor industry requires specific technology, infrastructure, and expertise, all of which are currently lacking. The United States has only one company that refines high-purity gallium and one operation for germanium. A research and development laboratory could boost innovation to increase processing capacity and produce minerals in a more cost-effective way.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Energy already funds laboratories focused on critical minerals for electric vehicles (EVs) and clean energy, but there is less focus on semiconductor minerals such as gallium and germanium. For example, the Critical Minerals Innovation Hub at the Ames National Laboratory in Iowa and the Minerals to Materials Supply Chain Research Facility (METALLIC) network bring together the expertise of several leading national laboratories to find solutions to critical minerals supply challenges for clean energy industries. The Department of Commerce should fund similar initiatives focused on minerals for the semiconductor industry. National laboratories can help develop the capabilities, technologies, and skills needed to produce refined semiconductor minerals at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put together a comprehensive incentives package that addresses upstream critical minerals mining and midstream processing and refining.&lt;/strong&gt; Just as the CHIPS and Science Act focused on incentives to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentivized investments in EV and clean energy technologies, an upstream and midstream critical minerals incentives package would ensure that U.S. fabs manufacturing the next generation of semiconductor technologies have reliable access to the critical minerals they need. With billions of dollars being invested in chips foundry facilities, their success hinges on access to needed input materials. Ensuring the security of the critical minerals supply chain is common-sense policy that supports the ambitious industrial goals of the CHIPS and Science Act and IRA.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This package should include investment and production tax credits such as those covered in Sections 48C and 45X of the IRA. Such incentives programs would encourage companies to make the necessary investments in critical minerals recovery and refining facilities amid uncertain and volatile market conditions. Midstream projects like Nyrstar’s gallium and germanium recovery plant are struggling to secure financing in the face of steep competition from Chinese firms that have a history of pricing out Western competitors. Federal tax credit programs signal to the private sector that the government is supportive of the industry and offer an additional cash incentive boost to projects that may otherwise stall. These incentives should apply to both domestic projects as well as ones in strategic allied countries that have high potential for gallium and germanium production, such as Australia and Peru.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An incentives package should also include grant funding similar to the large dollar amounts currently being awarded by the CHIPS Program Office within the Department of Commerce for onshoring semiconductor fabs. The U.S. government can incentivize mining companies to make significant investments in gallium and germanium recovery and refining facilities and infrastructure by alleviating some of the capital burden. Just as semiconductor manufacturing facilities require an immense amount of capital, standing up domestic gallium and germanium mining, processing, and refining infrastructure will require massive investment. These projects are not only essential to boosting supply chain security for the high-tech industries downstream that depend on critical minerals, but they will also create jobs, onshore manufacturing capacity and niche skills, and help revitalize mining communities that have been economically left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of the Western semiconductor industry depends on reliable access to the critical minerals that are responsible for continuous advancements in the industry. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 sought to build a domestic ecosystem for a thriving semiconductor industry that is invulnerable to the supply chain risks of the past. But this strategy was incomplete, as there has been no U.S. policy to date addressing the mineral needs of chips manufacturers. As China imposes mineral export restrictions and squeezes supply, policymakers can no longer afford to overlook mineral security. A comprehensive incentives package is needed to build research and development institutions and boost the upstream and midstream capacity needed to onshore and friend-shore gallium and germanium production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mineral Needs for the Defense Industrial Base&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;matthew-d-zolnowski&quot;&gt;Matthew D. Zolnowski&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The defense industrial base is at risk of critical minerals shortages in an emergency, with industrial mobilization doctrine and program execution mired in a peace dividend posture.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the furthest upstream tier of defense supply chains, critical minerals support virtually all Department of Defense (DOD) activities and platforms, whether through indirect consumption, such as a rare earth catalyst for petroleum refining, or direct consumption, such as aluminum and titanium parts in an aircraft. In some cases, the critical minerals supporting a defense system are indistinguishable from those used in civilian products; in others, critical minerals are converted into military-unique formulations that enable a weapon system’s cutting-edge performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this critical minerals consumption pattern is a constant for all military organizations throughout human history—whether using bombs and bullets, shot and pike, or sling and stone. Therefore, incorporation into a weapon system is not, by itself, sufficient reason for critical minerals to be deemed essential to national defense. This type of usage certainly would not justify the DOD’s deployment of over $1 billion since 2019 under the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 and other authorities to expand domestic and allied production of critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this contradiction in mind, this chapter aims to describe the process by which the DOD determines whether a critical mineral rises to the level of a national defense requirement, as well as how the DOD and industry are addressing such needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its simplest form, the DOD’s assessment of the “criticality” of a critical mineral is directly connected to the National Defense Strategy and its policy assumptions about the conflicts in which the DOD may be called to fight. Though defense planners historically focused on protracted conflict, the DOD has drifted toward a more optimistic policy baseline: a single-year conflict followed by a multiyear reconstitution period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even under this more optimistic baseline, the DOD has identified significant supply deficits to defense requirements during a national emergency scenario, covering 69 materials and valued at $2.41 billion. In addition to the large-scale industry investments previously noted, these findings have prompted the DOD to embark on wide-ranging reforms to its critical minerals stockpiling law, as well as to tighten procurement restrictions to reduce reliance on adversarial nations for critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the DOD has made significant strides in modernizing statutory authorities and deploying an array of programs to address its critical minerals needs, many of its planning processes related to requirements generation and industrial mobilization remain rooted in the immediate post–Cold War period. Maintaining the positive progress to date, while reviewing and updating those policies and programs that have not kept pace, should be the DOD’s next area of focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-spectrum-of-military-activities-requirements-generation&quot;&gt;THE SPECTRUM OF MILITARY ACTIVITIES REQUIREMENTS GENERATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spectrum of activities undertaken by the U.S. Armed Forces is vast. They conduct military-to-military diplomacy, peacekeeping operations, and potential combat operations, ranging from raids by special operations forces to the deployment of a multinational force for large-scale conventional war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this extreme variability, the DOD has developed a structured process to collect critical minerals data and evaluate which minerals are necessary for both essential civilian and defense industries across a range of scenarios. The DOD has made no public report of its critical minerals needs since 2015, but the results of its assessments are disseminated across the U.S. government every two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a high level, this process begins with the collection of economic and technical data related to critical minerals markets. This data is integrated by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Strategic Materials, the administrator of the National Defense Stockpile (NDS), for analysis through a series of economic models. These models project the anticipated supply and demand of critical minerals over a given period, after which supply and demand are perturbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These perturbations are driven by policy judgments related to the execution of a military conflict scenario used for DOD budgetary and planning purposes—underpinned by the National Defense Strategy. The elements described in this scenario include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the duration of the conflict&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the military force deployed&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;combat losses&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;military, industrial, and essential civilian demand&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;shipping losses&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the availability of foreign supply&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;domestic industrial mobilization&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;civilian austerity measures&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these elements is highly subjective, and historically these parameters have been hotly debated between defense planners concerned about a protracted war and those who expect conventional wars involving the U.S. Armed Forces to end quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its Cold War iteration, advocates of a “short war” planning construct argued that a potential conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union would be extraordinarily violent in its initial phases or might rapidly escalate to the nuclear level. In its contemporary iteration, advocates note the overwhelming conventional advantage of the U.S. Armed Forces over most threats—ably demonstrated in the First Gulf War—suggesting conflicts involving U.S. conventional forces are likely to be very short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case, industrial preparedness and stockpiling of any kind would be unnecessary, as the conflict may end before these efforts could impact its outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the legacy “long war” proponents argue that an asymmetry of conventional military power is an unreliable indicator of conflict duration—ably demonstrated by multi-decade counterinsurgency campaigns—and that an industrial base specialized toward a small, highly sophisticated fighting force will struggle to grow in a protracted conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the “long war” argument, important factors such as where and how U.S. Armed Forces may fight remain highly uncertain. Ultimately, this uncertainty drives hedging behavior, using stockpiles to mitigate demand for conflict surge items or minerals until new wartime production can come online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the initial promulgation of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, the combination of World War II and Korean War experiences led U.S. government planners to favor a “long war” planning construct. A five-year war scenario drove the creation of large NDS inventories and broad industrial mobilization activities under the DPA. As the Cold War progressed, subsequent administrations embraced more optimistic war-planning and economic policy judgments, each driving the U.S. government toward smaller critical minerals stockpiles and industrial preparedness efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “short war” planning construct adopted at the end of the Cold War remains the DOD’s baseline for critical minerals requirements generation today—a one-year conflict, followed by three years to reconstitute the U.S. Armed Forces. Based on these results, the DOD has implemented an array of critical minerals mitigation programs, principally focused on aerospace, operational energy, and armor needs (see Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the breadth of critical minerals mitigation programs underway, the unclassified summary of the “base case” results from the Strategic and Critical Materials 2023 Report on Stockpile Requirements identifies ongoing critical minerals requirements in a national emergency. This recent DOD study identified shortfalls to defense requirements for 69 materials, valued at $2.41 billion, and shortfalls to essential civilian demand for 24 materials, valued at approximately $12.21 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More simply, these results suggest that substantial portions of the DOD’s “short war” critical minerals needs remain unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;government-and-industry-mitigation-tools&quot;&gt;GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY MITIGATION TOOLS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the massive gap between current industrial base capabilities and postulated DOD requirements, the DOD pulls multiple levers to address day-to-day and future planning for critical minerals supply chain risk mitigation. Many of these levers are described in Joint Publication 4-05: Joint Mobilization Planning (JP 4-05), and in its most recent iteration, the principal industrial mobilization tools listed by the DOD include the following lines of effort:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;actively employ DPA Title I to prioritize DOD contracts or allocate scarce materials to defense contracts&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;expand military production and supporting sectors (e.g., workforce development)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;draw upon Canadian industrial capacity to supplement U.S. production&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;obtain other allied weapons production support&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;obtain waivers or exemptions from U.S. environmental laws to facilitate the above&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just as planning assumptions for NDS functions have remained on autopilot since the end of the Cold War, the industrial base mitigation tool kit—and the DOD doctrine governing it—has remained largely unchanged. More specifically, JP 4-05 is almost word-for-word identical from 1995 to the present, and shortcomings in doctrine and practice have yet to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contracting&quot;&gt;Contracting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DPA Title I requires a U.S. company, and any of its suppliers, to prioritize fulfilling a DOD order over any commercial one. The DOD estimates that it issues approximately 300,000 DPA Title I-rated contracts annually. The DOD can also request that DPA Title I ratings be applied to foreign sources, contingent upon local laws and the execution of a “Security of Supply Agreement” with the host government. Theoretically, the flowdown of DPA Title I ratings throughout the supply chain should provide the DOD with both traceability and the first “call” on any critical minerals necessary for defense procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the “paper” strength of DPA Title I, this authority has significant limitations in practice, all of which would hamper the DOD’s ability to direct critical minerals supplies to national needs in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, DPA Title I ratings only apply to U.S. companies and, by request, select U.S. allies. Any nation outside this circle—an adversary or otherwise—is under no obligation to support the DOD’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated by the volume of DPA Title I ratings, contracting and the incorporation of critical minerals sourcing requirements into such contracts is the most common tool for managing supply chain risk. Two of the most well-known critical minerals sourcing regulations are (1) the “specialty metals clause,” the colloquialism for a 1973 rule requiring the purchase of aerospace alloys and steel from U.S. or allied sources, and (2) the “sensitive materials rule,” a 2019 rule that prohibits the purchase of refractory metals and rare earth permanent magnets from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, defense contractors have been at odds with the metals and mining sector over these procurement rules. Broadly, the domestic metals and mining sector tends to favor rules that may drive defense spending toward their facilities, which may be more costly than foreign ones. Defense contractors, on the other hand, tend to oppose rules that may complicate subcontract management and compliance costs. Particularly when a subcontractor principally serves the commercial market, DOD-unique critical minerals sourcing rules may deter participation in defense contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever Congress has required the DOD to implement a new critical minerals sourcing rule, the timeline for implementation has been lengthy and subject to intense advocacy campaigns. For example, reaching a final rule on the “specialty metals clause” was the subject of ongoing regulatory and legislative advocacy for almost a decade. A similar battle is currently underway over the “sensitive materials rule.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two rules—the “specialty metals clause” and the “sensitive materials rule”—also highlight the well-intentioned but often inefficient promulgation of new critical minerals sourcing mandates. For example, samarium-cobalt permanent magnets are covered under both the “specialty metals clause” and the “sensitive materials rule,” but since the DOD’s implementation of the newer “sensitive materials rule” is executed on a contract-by-contract basis, ensuring contract compliance is highly complex and costly. Similarly, recycling is an important source of domestic production of critical minerals, but under the “sensitive materials rule,” only one of the four covered critical minerals may utilize domestic recycled feedstock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stockpiling&quot;&gt;Stockpiling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, stockpiling is hardly mentioned in JP 4-05. The limited references include one-off statements that (1) DPA Title I can compel delivery to stockpile contracts; (2) stockpiles should exist; (3) stockpiles should be released once mobilization begins; and (4) stockpiles should be rebuilt once the mobilization period ends. No other analysis or discussion of stockpile planning or management appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this brevity is refreshing, it also highlights a significant gap between DOD doctrine and NDS planning. As previously noted, NDS planning is driven by a short-war requirement, plus a long-term reconstitution phase. However, DOD doctrine calls for rapid in-crisis stockpile releases, with an indeterminate reconstitution phase. Put another way, the NDS stockpile sizing construct focuses on replacement once the fight is over, while Joint Staff doctrine wants to buy time during the emergency until other industrial base expansion programs come online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the requirements generation process for stockpiling and overall doctrine have remained static, the underlying Stockpiling Act has not. The DOD requested significant reforms to this law for the FY 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and Congress has proceeded to implement these changes across the FY 2023 and FY 2024 NDAAs. Among other elements, this reform aims to infuse private sector best practices into stockpile management while removing statutory barriers to more efficient government operations by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;consolidating multiple DOD critical minerals policy oversight boards into a new “Strategic and Critical Materials Board of Directors”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;authorizing multiyear procurements and general acquisition of shortfall materials&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;authorizing off-take agreements from DPA Title III industrial base investment projects&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;supporting feasibility studies for new critical minerals projects&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;expanding the scope of potential NDS research project applicants to include U.S. allies&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to these changes, the Stockpiling Act had remained largely untouched since 1979, and the DOD is only beginning to implement many of these reforms. On the other hand, though the NDS is authorized to carry out these new functions, new funding has slowed to a trickle. After a significant one-time appropriation of $125.0 million in FY 2022 and $93.5 million in FY 2023, FY 2024 funding collapsed to only $7.6 million. These funding increments are wholly insufficient to meet the shortfall requirements for defense ($2.41 billion) and essential civilian needs ($12.21 billion) in a national emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;industrial-base-investment-programs&quot;&gt;Industrial Base Investment Programs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pivoting to industrial base investment, the DOD offers an array of programs to foster the development of new critical minerals production technologies, sources of supply, and end use items for the military services. Among these are Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs, basic research and qualification projects funded by the NDS, pilot or prototype demonstration projects funded by the Industrial Base Fund (i.e., the Innovation Capability and Modernization (ICAM) program), feasibility or commercial scaling projects funded by the Defense Production Act Fund, and various military service–specific organic industrial base funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, industry has expressed its frustration with the DOD’s inability to bridge the “Valley of Death,” where the DOD supports early-stage development of an innovative technology or product but cannot transition it to procurement by a program of record. This frustration has also been directed toward the aforementioned industrial base investment programs. However, the DOD has several recent case studies in the critical minerals sector that provide reason for optimism, with multiple companies successfully transitioning from early-stage research to commercial-scale production with or through the DOD (see Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In alignment with JP 4-05, the DOD also has awarded defense industrial base investment funds to Canadian companies, who have been considered a “domestic source” since 1992. Additionally, Congress amended the DPA to expand the scope of eligible foreign allies to include the United Kingdom and Australia. Though a handful of Canadian firms have received DPA Title III awards, the legislative change for the United Kingdom and Australia is sufficiently recent that no such companies have received a DPA Title III award to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Whs2z2V.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: Critical Minerals Transition Programs.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s analysis of awards posted at FPDS-NG and USASpending.gov and press releases by the DOD and company awardees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding this apparent success in supporting critical minerals development through the Trump and Biden administrations, 70 percent of DOD funding for critical minerals projects—$778 million of $1.1 billion—has been derived from supplemental appropriations. In other words, Congress is the principal driver behind the DOD’s investments in critical minerals, not the DOD’s bottom-up requirements generation and budgetary process. To that end, recent DOD budget requests suggest that critical minerals investment funding will fall to approximately $30 million per year. Based on recent DPA Title III awards for critical minerals, this level of funding is sufficient to execute perhaps one or two “feasibility study” projects per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;waivers-or-expediency-under-other-domestic-laws&quot;&gt;Waivers or Expediency Under Other Domestic Laws&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to other authorities to waive domestic laws or otherwise expedite critical minerals projects, the DOD does not appear to have pursued or received authorization under extant pathways for regulatory relief in U.S. environmental laws. These include, for example, national security or paramount interest pathways under the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Air Act. However, additional information on DOD recommendations regarding U.S. environmental laws may be forthcoming through the FY 2025 NDAA. Namely, the U.S. House of Representatives included a requirement for the DOD to report on the impact of the National Environmental Policy Act on the largest defense industrial base projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental regulation aside, the DOD also does not appear to have actively pursued or promoted other nonregulatory pathways to streamline permitting activities for its projects—critical minerals or otherwise. Of note, only two DOD industrial base investment projects are included on the FAST-41 Covered Projects Dashboard: Perpetua Resources’ antimony project in Idaho and South32’s zinc-manganese project in Arizona. Given the limited dataset, it is not possible to determine whether inclusion on the FAST-41 dashboard provides a meaningful benefit to project development or whether other factors—such as a U.S. government award from the DOD or another agency—are more decisive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-1&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, the Joint Staff and DOD critical minerals programs need to update their war planning assumptions.&lt;/strong&gt; Senior DOD leadership, civilian and military, has clearly stated that the DOD must begin to prepare for a protracted conflict, but this view has not been reflected in the warfighting scenarios that the NDS uses for requirements generation. Without needed updates to war planning, DOD base budget requests will continue to grossly underestimate critical minerals needs. Therefore, the Joint Staff should develop a war-planning scenario suitable for NDS planning to reflect DOD policy and generate more realistic estimates of defense requirements for critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, the Joint Staff and DOD industrial investment and stockpiling programs should realign doctrine and program execution.&lt;/strong&gt; The industrial base management sections of the mobilization doctrine generated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, JP 4-05, have not changed since 1995. The document does not reflect lessons learned from (a) industrial base expansion efforts to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic or provide military assistance to Ukraine, (b) related medical or war reserve inventory distribution challenges, or (c) the management of DPA Title I allocations of scarce materials to the domestic market. Moreover, the objectives established in the current doctrine (i.e., provide in-crisis response) are not matched by the NDS requirements generation process (i.e., provide for reconstitution of forces). Therefore, the Joint Staff and civilian components of the DOD responsible for industrial mobilization should update JP 4-05 or develop new doctrine to reflect how the department is likely to respond to a mobilization event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, the DOD should stabilize funding for critical minerals in the base budget.&lt;/strong&gt; The DOD has made significant progress in supporting the upstream supply chain across numerous minerals. Though these efforts only began in earnest in 2019, DOD prime contractors and major subcontractors are already integrating new domestic sources into DOD programs of record. However, most of this success is being carried by one-off supplemental appropriations acts, which do not provide predictability to industry or the DOD for investment planning. Therefore, the congressional defense committees should continue to provide discrete program increases or “functional transfers” for critical minerals projects within industrial mobilization programs, such as the Defense Production Act Fund, the Industrial Base Fund, and the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, the DOD should streamline critical minerals sourcing rules.&lt;/strong&gt; Given rising concerns related to the United States’ reliance on adversarial sources, Congress continues to legislate mandates for the DOD to restrict sources of supply for critical minerals and end-use items containing critical minerals. In some cases, the same mineral is covered under multiple sourcing rules simultaneously, with nonsensical exception structures. This constantly shifting regulatory regime places a significant cost burden on all tiers of the defense industrial base, with the compliance burden especially acute at the prime contract level, given that noncompliance occurs many tiers removed from the prime contractor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the DOD’s Office of Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy should undertake an acquisition reform study focused on critical minerals sourcing. At a minimum, this study should identify the extant Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement rules and their underlying legislation for critical minerals products, describe these rules’ use and exception structures, and then develop a streamlining legislative proposal for Congress. As appropriate, this proposal also should include requests for funding to support the development of military specifications, standards, or other industry-led initiatives to validate sub-tier supplier compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explored in this chapter, the central question regarding the “criticality” of a critical mineral to national defense is whether the DOD finds a classified shortfall in defense or essential civilian industry needs in a postulated wartime scenario. However simple that question may be, the answer is highly susceptible to subjective policy judgments, which flow directly from the DOD’s National Defense Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past seven decades, U.S. defense policy has trended toward a more optimistic appraisal of the availability of foreign sources and the severity of a conflict involving the U.S. Armed Forces. This pendulum is now swinging in the opposite direction, with a greater focus on protracted conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOD planning and posture are beginning to change for the better, particularly for rare earth elements and battery minerals. However, the preponderance of the DOD’s efforts is funded by out-of-cycle supplemental appropriations acts. Critical minerals have not yet become a mainstay of the department’s base budget, nor has DOD doctrine and program execution materially evolved from its immediate post–Cold War posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On balance, the DOD and defense industry have notched major accomplishments to secure their supply chain for critical minerals. Fully addressing this challenge, though, is a marathon, not a sprint, and the work of the DOD, Congress, and industry in this realm has only just begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The single biggest determinant for key minerals such as lithium, graphite, cobalt, nickel, and manganese is consumer demand for EVs themselves.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of the electric vehicle (EV) industry has been the single biggest driver of critical minerals demand growth—a trend that is expected to continue for years to come. This demand growth has been fueled by government incentives at both the national and subnational levels globally. However, given the inherently international nature of the EV supply chain, U.S. EV manufacturers are concerned about disruptions stemming from rising geopolitical tensions. The EV industry—which has mobilized significant investment and created nearly 100,000 jobs in recent years—will require uninterrupted access to the materials needed to produce batteries and motors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Trump administration takes office, the future of the EV industry is clouded by uncertainty, with serious questions regarding the outlook for existing consumer and production incentives. The proximity of Tesla CEO Elon Musk to U.S. president Donald Trump may influence this decision, but more important will be the rationale for continued support in the context of economic security, strategic competition with China, and U.S. jobs. It is clear that U.S. automakers are already committed to the transition to EVs and hybrid vehicles, having invested billions of dollars over the past four years in building gigafactories across the United States and the rest of North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty for the sector also stems from shifts in consumer preferences and interest rates, technological advancements in battery chemistries, and a slower-than-expected expansion of the charging network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the uncertainty currently affecting the EV industry in the United States has a knock-on effect on the global market for critical minerals, particularly regarding U.S. and allied countries’ investments in the critical minerals supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter will examine the drivers of growing demand for EVs, the knock-on effects on demand for critical minerals, and the challenges facing the supply chain. It will also highlight the importance of innovation in the EV battery sector to reduce the industry’s vulnerability to interruptions and shortcomings in the critical minerals supply chain. A combined approach of reducing demand for critical minerals through innovation, boosting domestic supply of those minerals, and working closely with allies to secure U.S. supply chains will provide certainty and stability for the market, protecting U.S. investments, jobs, and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-the-automotive-market-in-the-united-states-and-north-america&quot;&gt;THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH AMERICA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The auto industry is a cornerstone of North American trade, accounting for 22 percent of total trade under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). It supports a staggering 42.2 million jobs across the region, both directly and indirectly. In the United States, the industry directly employs 9.7 million people and supports an additional 11 million indirect jobs, highlighting its critical role in the nation’s economy. In Mexico, the sector provides 1 million direct jobs and contributes to 20 million indirect positions, underscoring its importance in driving economic development. Canada, while smaller in scale, still benefits significantly, with 500,000 jobs tied to the industry. This interconnected workforce demonstrates the auto sector’s immense economic impact and its role as a vital driver of prosperity across North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, North America produced approximately 3.6 million EVs, and the industry created over 200,000 direct EV-related jobs across manufacturing, battery production, and infrastructure development. It is important to note that much of this production relies on cross-border, tariff-free trade under the USMCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;growing-demand&quot;&gt;Growing Demand&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single biggest determinant of demand for key minerals such as lithium, graphite, cobalt, nickel, and manganese is consumer demand for EVs themselves. This demand has grown substantially in recent years, with EV sales reaching nearly 14 million cars globally in 2023. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that global demand for critical minerals driven by EV production was under 2 million metric tons in 2020 but is projected to exceed 30 million metric tons by 2030, representing approximately 75 percent of the minerals required for clean technology (cleantech). By 2050, EV demand alone is expected to account for over 130 million metric tons, or roughly 90 percent of the total mineral demand for cleantech. However, this growth is mostly concentrated in the United States, Europe, and China—countries where the use of personal vehicles is more common—though EV sales in Southeast Asia and Brazil are picking up speed, largely due to government subsidies and the availability of low-priced Chinese EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, major decisions by auto companies to produce more EVs, or even shift to 100 percent EV production, have begun to fundamentally alter the market. General Motors’ 2021 announcement of plans to transition to 100 percent EV production by 2035 marked a watershed moment for the domestic industry. President Joe Biden’s goal of having 50 percent of auto sales be electric by 2030 was another signal to the market that demand will grow significantly. However, the major factor driving the EV market in recent years has been the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 6, provided important tax credits for new EV sales. Section 30D of the IRA includes a $7,500 tax credit specifically for light-duty EVs for individuals earning less than $150,000 or families earning less than $300,000. Half of the tax credit is allocated for batteries manufactured with materials mined in the United States or countries with which the United States has a free trade agreement. Notably, materials recycled within North America are also eligible. The percentage of the value of critical minerals mined or processed in these countries will increase from 40 percent in 2023 to 80 percent by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2025, batteries utilizing critical minerals mined or processed by foreign entities of concern (primarily referring to Chinese-owned firms) will not be eligible for the tax credit. The other portion of the EV credit applies to vehicles with batteries manufactured or assembled in North America, with the percentage of components manufactured in the region set to increase over time—from 50 percent in 2023 to 100 percent by 2029. The inclusion of this requirement in the IRA underscores the region’s importance in the auto industry and emphasizes the critical role of regional integration in strengthening the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-trends&quot;&gt;Recent Trends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the passage of the IRA, the United States has seen considerable growth in EV sales, reaching 7.9 percent of total sales in 2023. Driven largely by these incentives, sales of EVs have risen significantly in recent years in the United States. Despite a slow year in 2023, sales of EVs in the United States have rebounded rapidly in 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, EV sales increased by 11 percent year-on-year, while EVs as a share of all automotive sales in Q3 reached 8.9 percent. The EV industry will soon account for a tenth of all auto sales in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, progress has been far from linear. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, sales of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) grew to over 16 percent of total new light-duty vehicle sales in the United States in 2023. In the first part of 2024, however, EV sales declined, with nearly a 1 percent decrease in hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and BEVs sold in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year. This decrease in demand for EVs in 2023 and 2024 has pushed automakers to rethink their strategies, particularly as hybrid vehicles gain more traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that sales of EVs have risen significantly in the United States, these figures are disappointing compared to global numbers. In China, BEVs are projected to account for 50 percent of all light vehicle sales by the end of 2024—an impressive total with far-reaching implications for the global oil and critical minerals markets. According to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, Chinese EV manufacturing is comparable to the entire output of the U.S. auto industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xev7Yh4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of EV sales in Europe is less straightforward. After rapid growth in 2021 and 2022, 2023 saw a slowdown in global EV sales due to rising inflation and the end of government subsidies, particularly in Europe. This was most notable in Germany, where sales dropped by 37 percent in July 2024 following the government’s termination of EV subsidies. Registrations for hybrid vehicles in Europe reached 24 percent in July 2024, while EV registrations were just 13.6 percent—nearly a full percentage point lower than during the same time period the previous year. The slowdown in Europe continued throughout the first half of 2024, but EV sales saw an increase in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What these statistics show is that linear development of the EV industry is not guaranteed. Although numbers continue to rise, much work remains to drive consumer demand and ensure the industry’s sustainability in the United States. While long-term growth is expected, it is important for investors and policymakers to understand that progress will involve leaps forward and some steps back before a more widespread shift to EVs occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ev-supply-chain&quot;&gt;THE EV SUPPLY CHAIN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first phase of the EV battery supply chain, often referred to as the upstream portion of the supply chain, is raw mineral extraction. This phase is arguably one of the most important, as it forms the fundamental basis of the EV battery. The list of critical minerals essential for EV battery manufacturing is extensive and includes manganese, graphite (and graphene), lithium, nickel, and cobalt, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The midstream phase of the EV battery supply chain entails the processing and refining of raw materials. This typically requires high-heat or chemical-based treatments to transform the raw materials into what will eventually be cathode and anode active battery materials. Rare earth metals—a group of 17 elements—are used in various clean energy technologies for their “permanent magnetic properties.” In the specific case of EVs, they are primarily used in magnets for EV motors and as catalysts for battery fuel cells. Critical minerals processing tends to be regionally concentrated, and it is more common than not for extraction and refining to occur at separate facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third stage in the EV battery supply chain, the downstream phase, involves assembling battery cells into modules, which include battery management systems, electronics, and sensors. These modules are then packaged and sold to automakers, although some manufacturers produce and install their own battery packs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final process in the EV battery supply chain is reuse and recycling. Reuse entails “disassembly of the pack, testing module/cells, and repackaging.” Pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and direct recycling are currently the three most viable options for lithium-ion battery recycling, though new technological advances are emerging. Both reuse and recycling are logistically challenging—not only from an economic and regulatory standpoint but also in terms of the basic logistics of transporting the batteries. Moreover, the manufacturer-specific nature of the batteries adds to the cost of recycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ev-demand-and-the-critical-minerals-supply-chain&quot;&gt;EV DEMAND AND THE CRITICAL MINERALS SUPPLY CHAIN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is abundantly clear that the shift from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to EVs will require significantly increased quantities of critical minerals for EV production. Whereas a traditional ICE vehicle uses an estimated 34 kg of critical minerals, an EV uses approximately 200 kg, primarily for the electric motor and battery. However, this is likely to change over time as battery size, battery chemistry, modularity, and consumer preferences continue to change. While larger battery sizes may increase mineral demand, shifts in battery chemistry will impact the mix and proportions of metals required in those batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IEA makes the important point that the percentage of electric sport utility vehicles (SUVs) being sold has a significant impact on the critical minerals supply chain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Larger electric car models have a significant impact on battery supply chains and critical mineral demand. In 2023, the sales-weighted average battery electric SUV in Europe had a battery almost twice as large as the one in the average small electric car, with a proportionate impact on critical mineral needs. . . . If all electric SUVs sold in 2023 had instead been medium-sized cars, around 60 GWh of battery equivalent could have been avoided globally, with limited impact on range. Accounting for the different chemistries used in China, Europe, and the United States, this would be equivalent to almost 6,000 tonnes of lithium, 30,000 tonnes of nickel, almost 7,000 tonnes of cobalt, and over 8,000 tonnes of manganese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the IEA, copper, cobalt, nickel, lithium, rare earth elements, and aluminum are the minerals in highest demand. Demand for these critical minerals is projected to grow fourfold under the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario by 2040. However, this projection is subject to three key external factors: evolving technology, the development and implementation of governments’ clean energy policies, and the demand for EVs. All three factors are currently experiencing a high degree of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two-way connection between the EV market and critical minerals prices is exemplified by the recent collapse in lithium prices, which has impacted the competitiveness of EVs in automotive markets. After peaking at over $79,637 per ton in December 2022—driven by soaring demand for EVs—lithium prices fell to less than $11,000 per ton by September 2024. This decline was caused by several factors, including high interest rates, a weak Chinese economy, and market manipulation. Additionally, new resources coming into production globally and lower-than-expected EV sales following the initial surge in the United States, China, and Europe were significant contributors. Stagnating EV sales in 2023 had a profound and rapid impact on the lithium market. For instance, earlier in 2024, Ganfeng Lithium Group reported a net loss of $107 million and announced plans to limit capacity expansions as a “glut of supply overwhelmed slower-than-expected demand growth from electric-vehicle makers, driving spot carbonate prices to a three-year low.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts predict that the current oversupply of lithium will last until 2027. In the interim, there is hope that new extraction—and, more importantly, processing—projects will come into operation around the world, particularly in the United States and U.S.-friendly countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty in estimating demand projections is further exacerbated by governments’ evolving approaches to clean energy policy development and implementation. For example, changes in administrations in the United States and a potential move away from the incentives outlined in the IRA will play a significant role in determining short-term demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors influencing future EV demand include local- and state-level incentives and regulations. Just as the IRA’s clean vehicle tax credits boosted demand for EVs after 2022, California’s rapid shift toward an EV-friendly regulatory framework and higher gasoline prices had a similar effect. While California has the best-known incentives, many other states have followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer financing innovations also have the potential to incentivize higher EV sales and end-of-life recycling. In the United States, the IRA succeeded in driving new financing from auto firms such as Hyundai, whose vehicles were not eligible for IRA tax credits. In response, Hyundai implemented its own financing mechanisms to match the value of these credits. At the industry level, there is room for even greater innovation. For example, a recent paper on the cobalt supply chain proposed a “lease-to-recycle” model for batteries to drive EV adoption and enhance the potential for recycling battery metals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector funding for EVs and battery facilities has significantly shaped the industry’s development in the United States. Between 2018 and 2024, the private sector has announced investments of $90 billion in battery facilities and $33 billion in EV facilities. Notably, states with Republican governors have been more successful in securing this funding, with the southern region of the United States receiving over $68 billion in regional investments. In comparison, the Northeast received just $300 million, while the West Coast garnered $13.3 billion—well below the South’s total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One additional factor influencing the demand for critical minerals for EVs is the buildout of the charging network. Persistent consumer concerns about locating charging stations, charging speeds, and the maintenance and distribution of these stations are often grouped under the term “range anxiety.” However, as EV ranges improve with advances in battery technologies, it may be more accurate to discuss charging convenience. Potential EV buyers in urban areas face unique challenges regarding access to charging infrastructure. For example, availability in their neighborhoods—or, more specifically, in apartment buildings—may be limited. Drivers who lack garages and rely on street parking face even greater concerns about convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program allocated $7.5 billion to the construction of 30,000 charging ports across the United States, with a particular focus on Alternative Fuel Corridors. These funds are intended to be distributed through state governments. However, as of November 12, 2024, only 102 charging ports at 25 charging stations in nine states had been opened. Several factors have contributed to this slow rollout, but a significant portion of the total funding—around $4 billion—has already been committed to the states. Consequently, the buildout will accelerate over the next few years, as these funds cannot easily be rescinded by the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-technological-innovation&quot;&gt;THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation in battery chemistry and design is likely to play a crucial role in shaping the demand for critical minerals in the EV industry. While the internal combustion engine evolved slowly over the past 150 years, the EV industry is seeing rapid, profound, and unparalleled advances in battery chemistry, design, and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mineral demand for EV batteries depends on the cathode and anode chemistries of the batteries but is ultimately influenced by evolving technologies that have the potential to alter the mineral composition of EV batteries. For example, an NMC (nickel manganese cobalt oxide) battery uses half as much nickel as an NCA (nickel cobalt aluminum oxide) battery but requires eight times more cobalt. LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries, by contrast, require 50 percent more copper than NMC batteries but do not use nickel, cobalt, or manganese. NMC batteries typically last around 2,000 cycles—a battery cycle is the process of a battery being fully charged and then discharged—though their capacity declines significantly after 1,000 cycles. By comparison, LFP batteries are more durable, retaining 80 percent of their capacity after 3,000 cycles. This longer lifespan and more consistent performance over time help to explain the rise of LFP batteries in China, where they now dominate the market, accounting for over 60 percent of current vehicle sales. A similar trend is emerging in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reduced emphasis on nickel and cobalt not only decreases U.S. exposure to Chinese-controlled extraction and processing. It could also transform the debate over deep sea mining, removing a key justification for the extraction of polymetallic nodules rich in cobalt and nickel from the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing and emerging battery chemistries and technologies that will play a major role in the near future include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Existing Technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Lithium-Ion Batteries (Li-ion):&lt;/strong&gt; The current industry standard, Li-ion batteries, offers a balance of energy density, lifespan, and cost. These batteries encompass multiple chemistries, including lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (NMC) and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxides (NCA). While Li-ion batteries continue to power most EVs on the road today, they are rapidly losing ground to LFP batteries. The continued use of Li-ion batteries sustains high demand for lithium, nickel, and cobalt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) Batteries:&lt;/strong&gt; Safer and cheaper than traditional Li-ion chemistries but with lower energy density, LFP batteries are rapidly challenging the status quo in EV sales. A shift to LFP means lower demand for cobalt and nickel, with increased use of more abundant iron and phosphate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emerging Technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Solid-State Batteries:&lt;/strong&gt; These batteries, though still in development, promise higher energy density and improved safety by replacing liquid electrolytes with solid materials. The development of solid-state technology will reduce the need for cobalt and nickel but continue reliance on lithium and possibly new solid electrolytes, like lithium metal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;Graphene-Based Batteries:&lt;/strong&gt; A technology still in development, graphene batteries involve the integration of graphene into the cathode and anode to significantly improve energy density, charging speeds, and battery life. Often considered a “wonder material” due to its lightweight nature and superior performance in various applications, graphene’s high conductivity allows for faster charge transfer, and its durability supports longer-lasting batteries, making it a promising material for future EV battery advancements. A shift to this technology would increase demand for graphite and graphene, the latter being essentially the building block for graphite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. &lt;strong&gt;Sodium-Ion (Na+) Batteries:&lt;/strong&gt; An emerging alternative to Li-ion batteries, Na+ batteries use sodium instead of lithium as the primary charge carrier. They can be cheaper and more sustainable than lithium (due to the natural abundance of sodium), but they have lower energy density. Na+ batteries have potential applications in stationary energy storage and some EVs. Growth in their use would reduce dependence on lithium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d. &lt;strong&gt;Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) Batteries:&lt;/strong&gt; This emerging subset of lithium-ion chemistries has the potential for very high energy density but faces issues with durability and lifespan. Li-S batteries have a higher energy density than traditional Li-ion batteries and rely on sulfur, which is abundant and inexpensive, instead of nickel and cobalt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battery design is also an important factor. Currently, EV batteries are relatively standardized across the industry. However, experts anticipate that future developments will introduce modular designs, enabling customers to tailor their batteries to meet specific needs, such as prioritizing extended range or enhanced performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The return of the Trump administration is expected to bring major changes to U.S. EV policies, potentially undoing or slowing down key Biden-era efforts. Trump has expressed skepticism toward EVs and may push to roll back regulations and eliminate the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers. Such moves could create hurdles for automakers and dampen consumer interest in EVs, raising concerns across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding for EV infrastructure, including nationwide charging stations, may also face cuts or redirection, while emissions standards could be relaxed. Despite these federal policy shifts, states like California are expected to continue pursuing aggressive climate and EV initiatives. This may lead to legal battles reminiscent of previous conflicts over state versus federal authority on environmental regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three key recommendations are proposed to address the challenges posed by potential policy shifts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize investing in innovation.&lt;/strong&gt; This can be done through two avenues. First, the Department of Energy should fund research into battery technologies that use smaller quantities of critical materials, explore applications for more abundant resources (such as sodium and graphene), and reduce both costs and dependency on foreign suppliers. If U.S. innovation can be harnessed effectively to reduce the vulnerabilities of the EV battery supply chain, jobs, investments, and U.S. competitiveness can be protected and promoted. Second, the government should fund innovation to strengthen the circular economy. The United States needs to advance recycling technologies and policies to maximize resource efficiency and minimize waste in battery production and use. Battery metals that have already been processed to the point where they can be used in batteries require less processing when recycled than newly extracted metals. The Department of Energy must continue to fund research into battery design to enhance the potential for recycling battery metals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use tariffs judiciously and promote stable tariff policies.&lt;/strong&gt; In November 2024, Trump announced that his administration would impose a 25 percent tariff on all goods entering the United States from Mexico and Canada (and an additional 10 percent on goods entering from China). This would be highly disruptive for the auto industry, which has a deeply integrated mine-to-market supply chain in North America, given that mining, processing, and manufacturing occur across the continent. For example, Canada is the biggest supplier of nickel alloys that are vital for EVs. The United States has only one operating nickel mine—Lundin’s Eagle Mine in Northern Michigan. However, since the United States does not have a single completed nickel refinery, the entirety of nickel output from Lundin’s Eagle Mine is exported to a refinery in Sudbury, Canada, and the refined ore is then sold back to U.S. firms for manufacturing. Given the importance of the automotive sector to the United States, the Trump administration should minimize tariffs with allied nations. Importantly, policies also need to be stable—when mining, processing, and manufacturing firms lack certainty, they are more likely to withhold investment in the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand production tax credits for all domestically manufactured vehicles.&lt;/strong&gt; The IRA has shown that industrial policy can drive huge levels of investment and meaningful job growth. It is time for the U.S. government to provide such support for the entire U.S. auto industry, privileging U.S. and North American content in ways that help the industry compete against Chinese competition, both domestically and abroad. IRA credits for EV production have driven hundreds of billions of dollars in investment in the United States—across traditionally red and blue states. Providing similar support for the entire auto industry would likely drive investment from U.S. and foreign auto manufacturers and bring manufacturing job growth to the United States. However, it is important to note that the EV industry warrants larger production tax credits due to its more nascent technology, as well as that Chinese EVs have become dominant in many overseas markets. Production tax credits will allow the U.S. EV industry to develop and achieve a larger global footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s EV critical minerals supply chains are based on yesterday’s estimated demand for existing battery chemistries, and as this chapter has shown, there is a rapid evolution in battery technologies underway. Whereas the internal combustion engine remained largely unchanged throughout most of its existence, battery technology is progressing at a breakneck pace. Impressive innovation already underway in the EV battery industry will continue to shift critical minerals demand, and that necessitates a more liberal approach to the U.S. supply chain strategy. The United States must take advantage of its incentive-based system that prioritizes public-private cooperation to foster innovation and not only match Chinese advances but actually surpass them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Role of Critical Minerals in Renewable Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The renewable energy sector is increasingly central to both economic growth and national security, making [such] supply chain vulnerabilities untenable.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a niche source of electricity generation, renewables are rapidly increasing their share in the global power system. Led by solar, investments in renewable energy compromise more than 90 percent of power sector investment. Renewable sources accounted for 30 percent of total global power generation in 2023 and have been growing faster than the power sector overall. This has been driven in part by a decline in costs: Between 2009 and 2019, the price of wind power dropped by 70 percent and solar by 89 percent, making both technologies competitive with other new sources of electricity and an attractive economic option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, renewables are already a significant contributor to the grid and have a promising outlook. With the exception of hydropower, renewable sources contributed 15.7 percent of U.S. power generation in 2023, with wind providing 10.2 percent and solar 3.9 percent. The tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are further improving the outlook for both deployment and domestic manufacturing of renewables components. Projections suggest that by 2050, wind and solar could supply anywhere from 44 to 85 percent of U.S. power generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such rapid growth in renewables, however, brings its own set of challenges. Building renewable energy infrastructure, especially wind turbines and solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, requires substantial inputs of both common materials such as concrete, steel, and aluminum and specialized minerals such as cobalt, tellurium, and rare earth elements (REEs). Wind projects incorporate 18 of the 50 critical minerals identified by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in its 2022 Critical Minerals Assessment, while solar projects require 15 of them. As demand for renewables grows, so too will demand for those critical inputs. And as manufacturing of solar PV and wind turbine components is reshored, the economic stakes of supply disruptions to critical minerals will increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The renewable energy sector is increasingly central to both economic growth and national security, making such supply chain vulnerabilities untenable. To secure the future of renewable energy and meet ambitious climate targets, U.S. policymakers should address these vulnerabilities as part of a comprehensive approach to building a larger and more diversified supply chain for clean energy. This chapter focuses on two materials that already have the attention of policymakers and are key to deploying the most used technologies: REEs for wind turbines and polysilicon for solar PV. As such, they are also key to U.S. goals related to derisking supply chains, ensuring economic security, and furnishing the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;material-needs&quot;&gt;MATERIAL NEEDS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that global demand for minerals used in wind and solar PV could increase by a factor of about three in scenarios involving rapid emissions reductions by 2040. As a challenge for markets and policymakers to meet, this one appears “manageable.” By comparison, the demand for battery minerals is expected to grow more dramatically, with EVs and grid-scale batteries driving up demand for lithium by over 40 times today’s production levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in line with other global assessments from academic literature, which suggests that achieving ambitious climate targets through renewables deployment will require significant increases in key minerals. Stringent climate policies could triple the demand for certain REEs used in wind turbines, while the demand for polysilicon in solar PV could more than double. Though such rapid growth would surpass historical trends, global reserves are expected to be sufficient to meet cumulative demand, especially as recycling of older turbines and solar PV cells becomes economical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China holds a dominant role as a producer, refiner, and processor of both REEs and polysilicon. These materials have already faced export controls and tariffs, as well as prohibitions on imports into the United States under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. These disruptions—and their economic and social consequences—are motivating U.S. efforts to secure stronger supply chains of these materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wind&quot;&gt;Wind&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 years, the United States has installed an average of 10 gigawatts (GW) of wind capacity per year, resulting in nearly 150 GW of total installed wind capacity by the end of 2024. Energy modeling suggests that with the renewable tax credits from the IRA, wind capacity deployments could increase to 15 or 20 GW per year, which would double mineral demand over the next decade. However, in its assessment of the material requirements for renewables, the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) projected that achieving ambitious climate targets could require wind capacity deployment of up to 90 GW per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As wind energy deployment grows, the demand for minerals increases proportionally for each input—with REEs standing out as a particular area of vulnerability. These elements are key to the efficient and lightweight permanent magnets that allow for large wind turbines. The U.S. wind industry already consumes a small fraction of global production (see Table 1), and further expansion would require a substantial portion of today’s global output. The huge relative share of global production that will be required to serve U.S. demand alone indicates there is significant transition risk associated with REE supply, a judgment echoed in the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)’s 2023 Critical Minerals Assessment. Expanded wind deployment globally will require much higher production of REEs, with the IEA estimating that ambitious climate targets would require REE production to increase by up to a factor of 7 by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to future availability, supply concentration is a particular concern for REEs. China accounts for about 60 percent of REE extraction, 85 percent of processing, and over 90 percent of permanent magnet production. Its dominant role in refining and processing is particularly important. The United States is the second-largest producer of REEs globally, behind China, but U.S.-produced rare earths have historically been sent to China for processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical mineral supply chain for wind power, particularly when it comes to REEs, is vulnerable and potentially problematic. Given the importance of REEs and permanent magnets throughout the economy, they are already being addressed by policymakers. The United States is home to one major rare earth mine, the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine and Processing Facility in California. In 2023, its operator, MP Materials, announced plans to recommission processing facilities at the site to separate and refine high-purity neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, essential in permanent magnets. The DOE is also supporting an MP Materials facility in Texas that will produce rare earth magnets. Additional investments are being made to establish REE processing in the United States. Australian company Lynas Rare Earths, with support from the U.S. Department of Defense, is constructing a facility in Hondo, Texas, that will process both light and heavy REEs supplied by mines in Australia. These efforts are designed to create a full supply chain for REEs that can meet some of U.S. demand and diversify away from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Availability of Vulnerable Wind Materials Needed to Satisfy Annual U.S. Wind Deployment.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82830.pdf&quot;&gt;Aubryn Cooperman et al., Renewable Energy Materials Properties Database: Summary (Golden, CO: National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2023), 20–21&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;solar&quot;&gt;Solar&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, the United States has added over 100 GW of solar PV capacity, culminating in 131 GW of installed capacity by the end of 2024. Unlike the relatively steady growth of wind power, solar deployment has been accelerating. Projects planned and under construction are expected to increase solar capacity by 38 percent between 2023 and 2024 alone. Looking ahead, forecast models suggest IRA incentives could help grow solar capacity by 30 to 60 GW per year by 2035. Similarly, the DOE has projected high-end deployment rates of nearly 70 GW per year through 2035, tapering to 50 GW per year by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high-deployment scenarios for solar, the DOE found that while demand would increase for materials such as silver, silicon, and aluminum, these increases would be moderate compared to today’s production and rising global demand. In the case of silicon, the maximum consumption estimate for 2030 is 157,000 tons per year, which remains small compared to today’s annual production of 8 million tons. Overall, by 2030, rapid solar deployment in the United States is projected to account for about 0.6 percent of current global demand for aluminum, 2.0 percent for silicon, and 3.7 percent for silver. Despite the diverse material requirements, the quantities needed for U.S. solar power make it relatively safe from supply limitations even in high-use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although silicon is abundant, solar PV systems require silicon products that are purified and refined. Most solar PV modules currently being deployed use crystalline silicon (c-Si) cells, which use polysilicon as a key input. Polysilicon is essential for the semiconducting properties that convert sunlight into energy and is less costly than monocrystalline silicon. Solar-grade polysilicon must be of very high purity and thus requires refining and processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China dominates solar-grade polysilicon production, accounting for 85 percent of global manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of that capacity is located in Xinjiang Province, raising concerns about the potential use of forced labor in the solar supply chain. Additionally, the environmental impact of Chinese solar manufacturing is notable, as reliance on a coal-heavy grid results in Chinese polysilicon having higher emissions. More broadly, the high concentration of supply in China raises concerns about supply chain dependence for U.S. manufacturers of downstream products, including solar cells and modules. A recent study found that reshoring PV manufacturing to the United States would decrease the sector’s emissions intensity by 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pursuit of supply diversification, tax credits and trade restrictions on Chinese products could incentivize the relocation of polysilicon manufacturing to the United States. The DOE is tracking 69,000 tons per year of U.S. polysilicon production capacity, which compares favorably to the 157,000 tons per year by 2030 in a high-solar-deployment scenario. This capacity currently stems from three facilities that have been reopened or expanded in recent years: Hemlock Semiconductor, REC Silicon, and Wacker Polysilicon North America. Michigan-based Hemlock Semiconductor, for example, announced an expansion in 2022, and REC Silicon is reopening a formerly shuttered manufacturing facility in Moses Lake, Washington. In addition, the DOE allocated funds in April 2024 to support Tennessee-based Highland Materials for a manufacturing plant that will produce 16,000 tons of solar-grade polysilicon. These projects are being enabled by the IRA’s 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit, under which companies can claim $3 per kilogram for manufacturing solar-grade polysilicon, as well as additional credits for manufacturing PV wafers, cells, and modules, as well as other solar-related components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-2&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific policy interventions have enabled the progress that U.S. industry has made in securing supply chains for REEs and polysilicon. But the job is not yet complete, and projects are still coming online. Looking forward, these programs will have to be evaluated on their ability to foster commercially viable projects that participate meaningfully in the supply chain for an expanding renewables industry. Commercial competition, especially from Chinese firms, will be intense. Policy interventions will be successful when they help build a resilient supply chain for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The DOE and other agencies should seek opportunities to coordinate different policy tools to develop integrated supply chains.&lt;/strong&gt; For REEs, the key will be to develop expertise and technology that can refine and process these minerals for multiple uses and incorporate them into permanent magnets. This will help the United States take advantage of its domestic production and bring part of the supply chain out of China. Additional projects can take advantage of the IRA’s 48C tax credits and support from the DOE’s Loan Program Office, which can fund critical mineral projects at all stages of production: extraction, processing, manufacturing, and recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policymakers should cooperate with allies such as Australia and Canada in securing REEs.&lt;/strong&gt; Expanding collaboration through the Minerals Security Partnership or bilateral trade agreements could help source additional REEs for processing or manufacturing in the United States. In particular, expanding the Defense Productions Act’s definition of “domestic source” to include Australia would grant mining and processing facilities in that mineral-rich country access to direct support and procurement authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polysilicon projects under development should be fostered and linked to higher levels of the solar supply chain.&lt;/strong&gt; This will likely happen with support from the 45X tax credit, which applies to various stages of the solar manufacturing chain, including production of wafers, cells, and modules. Polysilicon projects at these stages can be encouraged to take advantage of domestic resources; wafer and cell manufacturing facilities in particular should be supported via the clean manufacturing tax credits and other programs to encourage local demand. Revising domestic content requirements for solar tax credits to reflect the upstream portions of the supply chain would further incentivize domestic polysilicon. Such integrated industry is key to building ecosystems of innovation that reduce cost and build resilient supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new administration should address the role that tariffs and trade restrictions on Chinese products and firms will play in its strategy for securing supply chains.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to enforcing trade restrictions on Chinese polysilicon, the Biden administration is increasing tariffs on rare earth magnets and Chinese-produced solar cells to defend domestic producers. In addition, there are multiple congressional proposals to exclude Chinese-sourced technology and minerals from U.S. tax credits.173 Such restrictions should be designed to address unfair trade practices, the high carbon intensity of Chinese production, and human rights but should not contribute to trade tensions through unfair protectionism. Moreover, fully excluding Chinese firms or technology—which could still be brought into the United States through joint ventures or licensing—would hamper efforts to establish resilient supply chains in a cost-effective way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-3&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is experiencing significant growth in renewables deployment, supported by climate policy and increasingly good economic outlooks for wind and solar power. While concerns over mineral supply constraints are warranted, they appear manageable in the case of the increased demand expected from renewables (though certain REEs will need attention). By contrast, concerns over China’s dominance in the production and processing of REEs, other critical minerals, and polysilicon are well founded. Investments in domestic production, refining, and recycling should help mitigate the risks of supply disruptions and reduce dependence on foreign sources, setting the stage for long-term energy security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Supply chain shifts and industrial transitions take time, but with the right adjustments, IRA incentives have the potential to catalyze shifts in mineral supply chains that may change the entire security landscape.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, the Biden administration’s flagship piece of legislation, aims to address climate change by boosting U.S. manufacturing of clean energy technologies such as electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, and wind turbines, as well as their components—including critical minerals. The Biden administration has set ambitious targets of cutting all carbon emissions from the transportation sector and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. To help meet these goals, the IRA was enacted to rapidly accelerate the development and uptake of EVs, as well as renewable energy projects, to decarbonize the electrical grid. All of these technologies are highly minerals intensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA was a politically contentious piece of legislation at the time of its passage, garnering exclusively Democratic support—not a single Republican in the House or Senate voted for the bill. However, that has not stopped Republican-led states from benefitting from the incoming investment, jobs, and technical skills spurred by the legislation. As of August 2024, nearly 85 percent of the total $126 billion in investments and 68 percent of the 150,000 newly created jobs have flowed to Republican districts. Ohio, North Carolina, and Georgia have been major recipients of IRA-induced projects, which may signal the beginning of a manufacturing renaissance accompanying the clean energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill’s provisions of tax credits, grants, and loan guarantees have led to a boom in domestic clean energy projects, catalyzing investment from abroad into U.S. manufacturing of EV batteries and solar cells. As these projects take off, the demand for critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel is projected to rise. Securing supply chains for minerals like lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and rare earth elements (REEs) is not only a goal of the IRA but also vital to the success of the law’s broader decarbonization objectives. The Biden administration has repeatedly emphasized the importance of securing critical minerals through the IRA. However, the implementation of the IRA’s provisions has been insufficient to fully address the needs of critical minerals supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the IRA’s impact on critical minerals security, this chapter describes each relevant provision and assesses its strengths and weaknesses. The IRA is then evaluated on its success in achieving its intended goals: accelerating decarbonization, boosting domestic manufacturing, and ensuring the security of critical minerals supply chains independent of adversaries. Analyzing the IRA provides valuable insights that can be applied to the mineral supply chains of other industries, including energy technologies, semiconductors, defense applications, and the industries that drive the modern economy. Landmark legislation like the IRA has the potential to make or break U.S. critical minerals security goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-portions-of-the-inflation-reduction-act-address-critical-minerals&quot;&gt;WHAT PORTIONS OF THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT ADDRESS CRITICAL MINERALS?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA creates or expands the following incentives that apply to the critical minerals industry: Section 30D New Clean Vehicle Credit, Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, Section 48C Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit, additional capital for the Defense Production Act Title III, and the programs of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;section-30d-new-clean-vehicle-credit&quot;&gt;Section 30D New Clean Vehicle Credit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 30D of the IRA incentivizes the procurement of minerals for battery manufacturing from allied sources by providing up to $7,500 in tax credits for qualifying EV purchases. This provision is key to increasing affordability and deploying EVs at scale. To be eligible, vehicle manufacturers must meet several criteria, including sourcing requirements for critical minerals and components. The Department of the Treasury ruled that EVs will only be eligible for $3,750 of the credit if they meet specific thresholds for the critical mineral content of their batteries. As of 2024, 50 percent of the minerals in an eligible vehicle must be extracted and processed in the United States, a country with which the United States has a free trade agreement (FTA), or Japan, which is the sole beneficiary of a critical minerals agreement (CMA). This threshold increases annually, reaching 80 percent by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/q3Fz8mS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Free Trade Agreement Countries.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To receive the tax credit, vehicles must also comply with the foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law defines an FEOC as any entity “owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a government of a foreign country that is a covered nation.” There are four FEOCs: China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The Department of Energy further clarified the definition in December 2023, determining that an entity is considered an FEOC if 25 percent or more of its voting rights, board seats, or equity interest are held by the government of a covered nation, or if the entity is effectively controlled by an FEOC through a license or contract. To qualify for Section 30D benefits, vehicles must not contain any minerals mined or processed by an FEOC, as defined. If any supplier to a vehicle manufacturer is in violation, the vehicle will not qualify for the Section 30D tax credit. This FEOC requirement goes into effect on January 1, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sourcing requirements were intended to catalyze investments in critical minerals production in both the United States and its free trade partners, as well as to incentivize auto manufacturers to shift away from foreign adversaries in favor of domestic mineral suppliers. However, an unintended consequence of the Section 30D tax credit has been the disqualification of many EVs manufactured in North America. At the start of 2024, only 10 vehicles qualified for the credit—a number likely to decrease once the FEOC rules go into effect in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FEOC threshold has come under rightful scrutiny. On the one hand, critics argue that the provision is too permissive and should not allow firms with any Chinese ownership to receive taxpayer-subsidized benefits from the IRA. On the other hand, the FTA threshold is viewed as too restrictive, as most FTA countries lack the minerals needed for EV battery manufacturing. There is broad consensus that legislative loopholes need to be closed, given that Chinese firms are reportedly using parent or shell companies to benefit from the tax incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle have expressed concerns about the implementation of Section 30D, particularly regarding FEOC guidance. Senator Joe Manchin (I-WV), at the time a Democrat and one of the original sponsors and key architects of the IRA, led a bipartisan group of senators to introduce a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval aimed at overturning the Department of the Treasury’s final rule implementing the Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credit. Manchin objected to the Biden administration’s interpretation of the Section 30D sourcing requirements, describing it as inconsistent with the intent of Congress. The senator stated that the Department of the Treasury’s determination “allows China to gain control of our nation’s auto industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphite is the greatest sourcing hurdle for most battery and EV manufacturers. It is the largest mineral component of a battery by weight, comprising over 145 pounds of the total 456 pounds of minerals in an EV battery. In comparison, an internal combustion engine requires no graphite and uses only 75 pounds of minerals in total. China accounts for 77 percent of natural graphite production, over 95 percent of synthetic graphite production, and nearly 100 percent of graphite refining. The United States, meanwhile, contains less than 1 percent of the world’s graphite reserves and is 100 percent import reliant, as it has yet to develop a domestic graphite mine despite significant government support for Graphite One’s project in Nome, Alaska. To keep U.S. EV manufacturing on track, the Department of the Treasury exempted graphite from FEOC requirements for two years, declaring it “impracticable-to-trace” until 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nascent North American graphite industry has raised concerns that the exemption could impede the development of a domestic graphite industry which cannot compete with Chinese prices. While the graphite exemption is necessary for the U.S. auto industry to remain competitive in EV manufacturing, alternative sources of graphite outside China are developing rapidly and are expected to come online in the coming years. Therefore, the exemption should remain in place until 2027 but should not be extended further. This will incentivize automakers to source graphite from Western suppliers and eliminate reliance on FEOC graphite by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the disapproval surrounding Section 30D’s implementation from both Congress and industry, the provision’s longevity under a new administration remains politically precarious. For Section 30D to remain politically viable for future administrations, it must be implemented in a manner that better protects the domestic industry, includes more strategic international partners, and prevents Chinese firms from benefitting, as Congress intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;section-45x-advanced-manufacturing-production-credit&quot;&gt;Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 45X of the IRA provides a 10 percent credit for the costs incurred during the production of critical minerals to specified levels of purity. The credit was intended to expand domestic production of critical mineral components for clean energy technologies. Notably, the credit phases out for all industries by 2032, except for critical minerals projects. This means that, if properly executed, the Section 45X credit could provide perennial financial support to capital-intensive critical minerals projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in December 2023, the Department of the Treasury proposed a rule that “direct and indirect material costs . . . and any costs related to the extraction or acquisition of raw materials would not be taken into account as production costs.” This would mean the tax credit could only be applied to mineral processing, not mining. The credit was not optimally designed for mineral processors either. According to the proposed rule, the costs of attaining raw minerals would not be covered under the Section 45X credit, but these raw material costs are often the primary expenses for mineral processors and recyclers. Therefore, even eligible mineral processors were not gaining much financial support from the Section 45X credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed Treasury Department rule met with intense opposition from private industry and congressional leaders. Nine Democratic senators wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in direct response to the department’s Section 45X rulemaking, expressing their displeasure and contending that the rule does not align with congressional intent. The National Mining Association, representing members including General Motors, MP Materials, Perpetua Resources, Rio Tinto, South32, and a host of other mining and automotive companies, submitted public comments that, without the inclusion of material and extraction costs in the calculation of Section 45X credits, “the impact of the 45X credit is significantly reduced.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, the Department of the Treasury released its final rule on Section 45X. In a stunning reversal, the final ruling recognized that previous guidance did not incentivize proportional investments in the minerals sector due to restrictions on what counted as production costs. The final rule clarified that material and extraction costs may now be included in calculating credits for projects producing eligible processed and refined critical minerals. This significantly changes the scale of benefits that critical minerals projects can derive from the Section 45X credit. Projects that are vertically integrating supply chains by feeding extracted ore from Western mining operations to U.S. refineries can now apply the 10 percent credit to the vast majority of their production costs in perpetuity. This will help offset the immense costs mineral projects face in a market highly vulnerable to Chinese manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;section-48c-qualifying-advanced-energy-project-credit&quot;&gt;Section 48C Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Section 48C investment tax credit provides $10 billion in credits for qualifying projects that fall into one of three categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean Energy Manufacturing and Recycling:&lt;/strong&gt; Reequips, expands, or establishes an industrial or manufacturing facility for advanced energy properties (e.g., EVs, solar panels, or energy storage systems)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industrial Decarbonization:&lt;/strong&gt; Retrofits a manufacturing facility in an energy-intensive sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Materials:&lt;/strong&gt; Reequips, expands, or establishes an industrial facility for the processing, refining, or recycling of critical materials&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers can seek a credit worth up to 30 percent of the total amount invested in facilities that produce critical minerals. Unlike the Section 45X credit, the Section 48C program is competitive—not all projects that apply for the credit will be granted benefits. In the first round of Section 48C awards, of the 250 full applications requesting $13.5 billion in credits, 35 projects totaling $4 billion in awards were selected. This is only a 14 percent acceptance rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the projects selected for the credit, two-thirds fell under the clean energy manufacturing and recycling category, meaning that critical materials projects were deprioritized in the first tranche of funding. So far, it seems the Section 48C tax credit has been meaningful in incentivizing companies to make investments in domestic production of critical materials, although funding remains more concentrated in downstream applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications for the second and final tranche of 48C funding were due in October 2024, and awards were announced in January 2025 to allocate the remaining $6 billion of funding. The distribution of funds for the second tranche was similar to the first, with only 25 percent of awards going to critical materials. Unless further funding is appropriated by Congress, the Section 48C program will end, rendering future projects ineligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minerals projects are at a disadvantage in meeting Section 48C timelines due to the condition that a project is only eligible if it has received all federal, state, and local permits within two years of receiving an award. This timeline is challenging for minerals projects to meet, considering it can take decades to obtain all the necessary permits. By the time many minerals projects would be able to receive all needed permits, mobilize capital, and put together an application, Section 48C will have no remaining funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-production-act-title-iii&quot;&gt;Defense Production Act Title III&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 was first enacted in response to the Korean War to expand the authorities of the president to ensure U.S. industry has the capability and capacity to meet national security needs. Title III of the act gives the president the authority to leverage incentives for private industry, such as loan guarantees, purchase commitments, and grants, to expand production capacity and supply of critical technologies. Since 1950, the DPA has been routinely invoked by presidents to respond to a number of crises, including the Cold War, the energy crisis of the 1970s, and the Covid-19 pandemic. The DPA is set to expire in 2025 unless reauthorized by Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA provided an additional $500 million toward the DPA Title III grants, which provide financial support to critical minerals projects that protect, expand, or restore industrial base capabilities critical to national security. Under the Biden administration, DPA Title III has been particularly important for building domestic midstream capabilities. To address this large vulnerability, DPA Title III has funded cobalt refining in Canada, titanium processing in North Carolina, and REE separation in Texas, along with several other critical minerals projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expansion-of-the-department-of-energys-loan-programs-office&quot;&gt;Expansion of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Department of Energy received an additional $11.7 billion in funding and was granted an additional $100 billion in loan authority for its Loan Programs Office (LPO). The office was first established in 2005 by the Energy Policy Act to fill the gaps in affordable private debt and bring promising energy technologies to market that would otherwise be unable to access private financing. In this way, the LPO acts as a “bridge to bankability” to kickstart projects that might otherwise take a long time to reach commercial scale. This is especially important for critical minerals projects that are struggling to attract financing during periods of depressed commodity prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA expanded the scope of the LPO to create new programs and increased the loan authority by $100 billion. Critical minerals projects can qualify for funding under the LPO’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM) as a qualifying vehicle component. If selected, companies can receive a direct loan or loan guarantee of up to 80 percent of the project’s eligible costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some loans have been granted for mining and mineral processing projects. In 2022, Syrah Resources, an Australian company, received the first ATVM loan in over a decade and the first of its kind for the critical materials industry. The $102 million loan from the Department of Energy will support its graphite processing facility in Vidalia, Louisiana. When Syrah’s facility is complete, it will create the first vertically integrated graphite supply chain outside of China, sourcing graphite from its mining operations in Mozambique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syrah Resources’ graphite production, supported by the LPO, was once thought to be an exemplary use of IRA funds. With the government’s support, the project was projected to boost U.S. manufacturing, create jobs, establish a new graphite supply chain independent of China, and create a graphite source that the U.S. EV industry can rely on to qualify for Section 30D benefits in 2027. However, in December 2024, Syrah Resources declared force majeure and suspended operations for its graphite mine in Mozambique, as unrest and violence plague the nation following a disputed election result. Now, Syrah’s Louisiana processing project is at risk as well, unable to source graphite feedstock from its partner project in Mozambique. The company’s stock plummeted as Syrah defaulted on its U.S. government–backed loans. This recent development highlights the inherent risk with LPO investments in projects with supply chains vulnerable to political disruption. The incident also shows the importance of diversifying mineral supply to decrease dependencies on a singular feedstock source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional loans in the critical materials sector have been extended to Ioneer’s Rhyolite Ridge project ($700 million) and Lithium Americas ($2.26 billion) for lithium production, as well as Li-Cycle ($375 million) for battery minerals recycling and recovery. But LPO grant funding for critical materials projects remains limited, with far greater amounts going toward battery manufacturing projects. Critical minerals projects seeking LPO funding still face many challenges—the LPO process is lengthy, challenging to navigate, and prone to delays, as upstream projects can take decades to obtain the permits and offtake agreements needed. While LPO funds would be meaningful for capital-intensive midstream projects, few currently exist in a market where achieving economic viability is so challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scoring-the-iras-critical-minerals-efficacy&quot;&gt;SCORING THE IRA’S CRITICAL MINERALS EFFICACY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA has three primary objectives as they relate to critical minerals security: (1) accelerate the deployment of mineral-intensive clean energy technologies, (2) support domestic manufacturing, and (3) secure supply chains by eliminating dependence on foreign adversaries. The law’s provisions described above were created with these objectives in mind. In practice, however, the IRA has yielded mixed results, and critical minerals supply chains have a long way to go before the United States and its allies have sufficient production to support the many clean energy projects underway downstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the IRA’s largest shortcomings is in “friendshoring” critical minerals production. Section 30D was intended to incentivize U.S. EV and battery manufacturers to source critical minerals from the United States or its FTA partners. However, limiting the benefit to FTA partners excluded crucial allies and major minerals producers such as Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Namibia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Vietnam, Zambia, and the European Union. Meanwhile, the primary mineral production of FTA partners, such as Chile, Mexico, and Peru, is copper—a critical material for energy that is not even eligible for Section 30D benefits, given that it is not on the Department of the Interior’s Critical Minerals List. Therefore, Section 30D is largely ineffective for sourcing from partners abroad: most FTA partners are not substantially benefiting from the IRA due to their limited resource reserves, and mineral-rich countries that could benefit are excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FnJASaA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Inflation Reduction Act Report Card.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One proposed workaround for granting more countries FTA status is through the use of CMAs, which are FTA-equivalent, minerals-specific agreements that could be negotiated on a shorter time frame than an entire FTA. The U.S.-Japan CMA was signed by the Biden administration in March 2023. However, the agreement was met with intense backlash from Congress, with Democrats as well as Republicans lamenting that the rushed agreement bypassed the role of Congress in ratifying FTAs. Since then, no additional CMAs have been signed, and the list of FTA-equivalent countries sits at just 21. As the critical minerals domestic sourcing requirement rises in the coming years, U.S. downstream manufacturers will need more diverse sourcing options to continue to qualify for benefits, but no framework to expeditiously incorporate more partners currently exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without widening the beneficiary list, there is no incentive for Western producers to invest in projects in resource-rich countries, nor any incentive for these countries to seek Western offtake of their mineral production, as China remains a willing buyer. This is adversely impacting the United States. As the Pentagon invests in REE separating and refining capacity for permanent magnet technologies through its DPA Title III program, these projects will depend on a steady supply of ore feedstock. With less than 2 percent of the world’s REE reserves inside U.S. borders, midstream refiners will need to work with global partners, like Brazil, to secure feedstock. Brazil holds nearly a fifth of the world’s known REE deposits. Brazil’s first REE mine, Serra Verde, started commercial production in 2024, but without the qualifications for Section 30D benefits, Brazil has no incentive to sign a long-term supply contract with a U.S. firm. Under the current IRA framework, the United States will lose offtake of key mineral deposits to Chinese refiners, and EV manufacturers will be unable to eliminate FEOC suppliers from their supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-1&quot;&gt;POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the IRA work better for mineral security, the U.S. government should pursue the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States needs to build on the FTA partner list to include mineral-rich strategic partners currently excluded and left behind.&lt;/strong&gt; Section 30D’s FTA requirements are arbitrary and were not created with mineral reserve locations in mind. The IRA cannot change geology, and global supply will remain reliant on Indonesia’s nickel, Madagascar’s graphite, and Argentina’s lithium for the foreseeable future. To be less discriminatory, the U.S. government should, in consultation with Congress, come up with a list of approved countries for Section 30D credits that align with U.S. mineral security goals and human rights standards. This will incentivize a greater number of strategically important countries to work with Western partners over Chinese buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This task may seem daunting, but there are a number of bilateral and multilateral cooperative forums and trade agreements that could be expanded. For example, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, and Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity could become more useful if they included binding terms, such as investment incentives, eligibility for subsidies and concessional financing, and preferential market access. Trade agreements can also be revised. For example, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) is up for reauthorization in 2025, and several of the beneficiaries—such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia—are rich in minerals. Most of these mineral exports currently go to China. By including an investment incentive—similar to Section 30D—in AGOA, the United States can both incentivize investment in these countries by Western companies and encourage routing supply to the United States instead of China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEOC rules should be amended to phase out taxpayer-subsidized benefits for projects with any Chinese ownership.&lt;/strong&gt; At present, to qualify for IRA tax credits, mineral projects must be less than 25 percent owned by an FEOC. This means that a mine that is 24 percent owned by a Chinese firm in Peru would still receive IRA benefits, given that the United States has an FTA with Peru. As the United States and allied nations build their capabilities, the United States should steadily reduce the FEOC ownership threshold to zero percent. This does not mean that Chinese firms cannot export to the United States; it simply means they will not be eligible for the tax credits that give them a competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional subsidies, such as a price floor, are needed for mining projects both at home and abroad that feed U.S. processors and refineries.&lt;/strong&gt; Western mining and processing operations will not be able to compete against Chinese and Russian prices without additional government support. The cost of producing nickel at Chinese-owned Weda Bay in Indonesia is just $4.23 per pound, compared to the U.S. Eagle Mine’s costs of $5.32 per pound. China produces minerals using dirtier energy sources, cheaper labor, and government subsidies designed to price out Western competition. U.S. critical minerals producers need all the support they can get to compete as prices for key energy minerals reach two-year lows. A price floor would give mining companies and their investors assurance that their capital-intensive projects will not become economically unviable due to commodity price volatility.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another example of how price floors could be crucial for mineral producers is palladium production. Palladium is key to hydrogen fuel cells, but its production is primarily concentrated in Russia (43 percent of global production) and South Africa (36 percent). The United States produced only 3.5 percent of the world’s palladium in 2023. Russian palladium operations are substantially cheaper than those in South Africa and the United States due to low safety standards. The total cash cost for mining one ounce of palladium at Norilsk in Russia is just $402 per ounce, compared to $590 at South Africa’s Mogalakwena operation. Sibanye-Stillwater, a South African company, owns the only major palladium operation in the United States. Its operating costs for 2024 reached over $1,000 per ounce—greater than the selling price of palladium. At times, the company was losing as much as $600 per ounce produced. As a result, the company announced nearly 800 layoffs for its palladium mining operations in Montana and paused production. A price floor could ensure that commodity prices do not fall below mining production costs, helping strategic mining operations remain operational and saving U.S. jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-4&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA is the most significant piece of legislation to date that addresses the component supply chain needed to secure clean energy technologies. It created a host of incentives designed to reroute mineral supply chains by stimulating investment in the United States and select partner nations. By some measures, the IRA has seen marked success; by others, there is still much work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply chain shifts and industrial transitions take time, but with the right adjustments, IRA incentives have the potential to catalyze shifts in mineral supply chains that may change the entire security landscape for the energy technologies of the future. To make the IRA work better for mineral supply chains, policymakers should expand the list of countries benefitting from mineral production and processing incentives; steadily tighten the FEOC ownership requirements to reduce the competitive advantage that firms with fractional Chinese ownership gain through the IRA; and leverage new financing tools, like price floors, to accelerate the development of mining and processing capabilities in the United States and allied nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA serves as an important template for how incentives could be structured to secure critical minerals supply chains for a variety of industries beyond just energy. Just as the IRA targets the lithium, graphite, and REEs needed for EVs and wind turbines, similar legislative initiatives could target gallium and germanium for semiconductors or antimony and tungsten for defense technologies. Securing mineral supply chains for the modern economy is one of the great challenges of our time. To succeed, policymakers will need the right set of incentives to push the private sector to innovate and expand to its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As legislative and executive branch action on critical minerals has largely focused on minerals associated with clean energy and electric vehicles, Congress should specifically address the supply of semiconductor inputs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semiconductor design and production were once major sources of economic power for the United States. In 1994, U.S. semiconductor companies commanded 50 percent of the European market, 40 percent of the Asia-Pacific market, and 17 percent of the Japanese market. The electronics industry in 1995 was one of only seven manufacturing industries in the United States that employed more than one million workers, with 40 percent of those workers focused specifically on chips, and that percentage was rising. At the time, Japan was the United States’ primary rival for dominance in the global semiconductor industry, with the United States holding the largest share of the global market and Japan close behind, while South Korea and Taiwan were beginning to establish their footholds. Amid this competition, governments in the United States, Japan, and Europe invested strategically in public-private partnerships for research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and in maintaining domestic production, aiming to secure an edge in a highly competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the global semiconductor market is more valuable than ever, but the global supply chain has become concentrated. Furthermore, the U.S. share of fabrication has fallen to about 10 percent in 2020, although U.S. firms’ market share remains robust due to their dominance in design and other key parts of the supply chain. As noted in Chapter 2, this dependence on other nations for fabrication raised major alarms during the Covid-19 pandemic, when chip shortages rendered many consumer products unavailable or far more costly than usual. For possibly the first time, consumers became aware of the prevalence of chips in products from automobiles to refrigerators. U.S. policymakers also awakened to U.S. semiconductor dependence, particularly on Taiwan, which supplies over 60 percent of global chips and more than 90 percent of advanced chips. Taiwan’s position is precarious: while it gains some protection from its “silicon shield” as a major chips supplier, Taiwan remains a geopolitical thorn in China’s side. Taiwan’s connection to the world—and semiconductor consumers—could be severed at any time by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors Act of 2022 (also known as the CHIPS and Science Act, but hereafter referred to in this chapter as the CHIPS Act) is the United States’ effort to invest in supply chain resilience. It aims to strengthen domestic production to guard against future chip shocks and—hopefully—limit China’s ability to threaten U.S. access to semiconductors by addressing reliance on Taiwan and other suppliers, while also boosting investments in U.S. innovation and research. However, the act did not include any provisions addressing mineral access, leaving access to key minerals such as gallium and germanium highly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-path-to-the-chips-acts-passage&quot;&gt;THE PATH TO THE CHIPS ACT’S PASSAGE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the pandemic supply chain shock, a number of semiconductor bills were introduced, many of which contained provisions that would eventually be passed in the CHIPS Act. The key bill was the CHIPS for America Act, introduced in the U.S. Senate on June 10, 2020, by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Mark Warner (D-VA), along with a companion bill in the U.S. House of Representatives from Reps. Doris Matsui (D-CA) and Michael McCaul (R-TX).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the CHIPS for America Act was not the only legislative vehicle proposed to counter China by strengthening domestic industries. Senators Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Todd Young’s (R-IN) Endless Frontiers Act, introduced on May 21, 2020, aimed to strengthen U.S. competitiveness in emerging technologies through investment in research and regional technology hubs. The Endless Frontiers Act was subsequently replaced by the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), sponsored by Schumer and introduced on April 20, 2021. USICA quickly ballooned from a bill targeting research investment to a massive $250 billion bill intended to tackle China’s rising power in emerging technologies across all of government. Cornyn and Warner’s CHIPS for America components were rolled into USICA, along with several other competitiveness bills and programs authorized by the FY 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). USICA passed the Senate in June 2021 with bipartisan support, but House counterpart bills, which included more progressive provisions, only passed along party lines. Differences between the versions passed by each chamber made reconciliation difficult, but eventually both chambers passed a House bill introduced by then Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) that had been amended to include significant portions of USICA along with key House demands on semiconductors, climate, and competitiveness. The CHIPS Act of 2022 was signed into law on August 9, 2022, retaining a focus on both science and research capacity and securing semiconductor supply chain resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, despite the extensive list of provisions and goals included in earlier versions, critical minerals for semiconductors were not prioritized in the CHIPS Act, nor mentioned in media coverage or press releases as a priority for action. Securing U.S. access to critical minerals had been a key objective for the U.S. government, as seen in the Biden administration’s February 2021 Executive Order on America’s Supply Chains, which built on a September 2020 executive order from the Trump administration. This called for the secretary of defense to produce a report that would identify risks in the critical minerals supply chain and make specific policy recommendations. Other bills passed in 2021, as outlined in other chapters of this volume, prioritized access to critical minerals for electric vehicles and renewable energy goals. The CHIPS Act did not address this interesting gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-chips-act-funds-and-activities-for-semiconductors&quot;&gt;KEY CHIPS ACT FUNDS AND ACTIVITIES FOR SEMICONDUCTORS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act appropriated $52.7 billion in funding for semiconductor-related activities through FY 2027, distributed across four distinct funds targeting different parts of the supply chain: the CHIPS for America Fund, the CHIPS for America Defense Fund, the CHIPS for America International Technology Security and Innovation Fund, and the CHIPS for America Workforce and Education Fund. These funds are appropriations for a number of programs and activities authorized by the FY 2021 NDAA, which had also been passed amid congressional concerns around U.S. semiconductor supply instability, as well as other activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS for America Fund, through which the majority of the appropriated funds will flow, provides the Department of Commerce with $50 billion to incentivize domestic manufacturing capabilities, R&amp;amp;D, and workforce development. Of this total, $39 billion is earmarked for a program to promote investment in semiconductor fabrication, assembly, testing, advanced packaging, and R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining $11 billion of the CHIPS for America Fund is marked for R&amp;amp;D and workforce development programs. Chief among these is the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), which focuses on the research and prototyping of advanced semiconductor technology, including work on next-generation materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another program, the National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program, is designed to enhance test, assembly, and packaging capabilities in the United States in coordination with the NSTC and the Manufacturing USA institutes. Lastly, funding is allocated for a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) R&amp;amp;D program, which focuses on next-generation microelectronics, including materials characterization or the study of the structure and properties of materials, an essential component in understanding materials before exploring their potential uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS for America Defense Fund appropriates $2 billion for the Department of Defense to stand up the National Network for Microelectronics Research and Development, also known as the Microelectronics Commons. The commons was created to support the “lab-to-fab” transition of chip innovation from academic development to commercial production and to expand the United States’ edge on next-generation semiconductor development, including innovation in artificial intelligence, quantum technology, and telecommunications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS for America International Technology Security and Innovation Fund (ITSI) appropriates $100 million annually for five years to the Department of State for coordination with foreign governments on telecommunications, semiconductors, and other emerging technologies. In a briefing following the CHIPS Act’s passage, the State Department unveiled its strategy for the ITSI fund, identifying “reliable access to critical minerals such as cobalt, aluminum, arsenic, copper, and rare earth elements” as one of its four priorities. The State Department would work to “secure and diversify” sources of these minerals across the entire processing chain, from mining to recycling. However, with limited funds and three other priorities to balance across vast industries, the fund’s impact on critical minerals projects is unlikely to be significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS for America Workforce and Education Fund appropriates a total of $200 million for workforce development activities administered by the National Science Foundation (NSF). One part of that fund, National Science Foundation for the Future, does not explicitly focus on semiconductors but does touch on critical mineral dependence. The NSF director is tasked with supporting basic research “to advance critical minerals mining strategies and technologies for the purpose of making better use of domestic resources and eliminating national reliance on minerals and mineral materials that are subject to supply disruptions.” Documentation on this fund also highlights the role of the NSTC’s Critical Minerals Subcommittee in strategizing and coordinating federal efforts on critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-chips-acts-impact-on-us-critical-minerals-supply-chains&quot;&gt;THE CHIPS ACT’S IMPACT ON U.S. CRITICAL MINERALS SUPPLY CHAINS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although minerals are referenced in various sections of the law, it is always as part of a list of desired outcomes and activities. As such, the CHIPS Act has had limited impact on critical minerals supply and access. However, future funding requests from fund beneficiaries could include projects that will either change domestic capacity for mining, processing, or recycling critical minerals or alter material needs for semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most identifiable direct impact comes as a result of ITSI funding for the Minerals Security Partnership, which convenes traditional allies such as the European Union as well as mineral-rich nations in Latin America and Africa. This group has committed to environmental and social standards for mining projects in countries willing to work with the partnership, seeking to create less exploitative arrangements than those offered by China. Ideally, this will lead to future resource agreements, reducing reliance on Chinese minerals, though timelines are long. As of March 2024, there are 23 confirmed projects across various critical minerals and rare earth elements, including gallium and germanium, but only two have reached key implementation milestones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another program with a clear intention to address critical minerals supply is the CHIPS for America incentives for semiconductor materials and manufacturing equipment facilities. The “Vision for Success” document for this program explicitly identifies reliance on China for upstream inputs like gallium as a supply chain resilience issue it seeks to address. However, minerals are not the only inputs targeted, and the program’s focus on companies looking to establish or expand their U.S. footprint may make it difficult for minerals companies to compete for funds. It remains to be seen whether minerals companies could—or would—successfully compete for this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other impacts on critical minerals seem largely theoretical to date, although tracking funding disbursed through numerous organizations and mechanisms is challenging. The CHIPS for America Vision for Success document on incentives for commercial fabrication facilities stipulates that CHIPS funding applicants must also attract associated suppliers, including “reliable” material suppliers “committed to operating and innovating in the United States.” The document also highlights fabrication companies’ use of new materials with unique performance properties as a focus of the theme of reducing costs. This focus has facilitated the expansion and modernization of facilities like GlobalFoundries’ 200 mm fab in Vermont, which enables the production of next-generation gallium nitride (GaN) chips—a win for domestic production of cutting-edge semiconductors. However, these chips still rely on critical minerals, and it is unclear whether CHIPS Act funding has spurred companies like GlobalFoundries to identify or invest in new partnerships to source minerals such as gallium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it is difficult to tell what impact funding for the Microelectronics Commons network could have on minerals. The network recently issued its first round of project awards but has released few details on what these “lab-to-fab” projects are. Information from the Midwest Microelectronics Consortium, one of the regional hubs receiving project awards, suggests the projects are focused on prototypes that advance packaging, processing, or other functionalities rather than new materials, architectures, or techniques that impact mineral reliance. However, the Northeast Microelectronics Coalition, another network hub, announced having won an award for the transfer of “High AlAl GaN from Lab to Fab,” indicating a potential new development in aluminum gallium nitride use. Otherwise, the network seems focused on other areas of work, such as AI, quantum technology, and electromagnetic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-a-stronger-future&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A STRONGER FUTURE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As legislative and executive branch action on critical minerals has largely focused on minerals associated with clean energy and electric vehicles, Congress should specifically address the supply of semiconductor inputs. Finding or creating domestic supply is no easy task, and any impactful investment in mineral access will require support for R&amp;amp;D to discover new refining methods, new sources, and other creative solutions. China had decades to subsidize and incentivize its domestic metals industry to dominate gallium production; the United States has much less time and faces greater limitations in terms of what its people are willing to accept in terms of economic and environmental costs. To address this challenge, the United States needs to focus on two fronts: developing new methods for mineral production, refinement, and recycling, and developing new approaches for semiconductor fabrication. Both, however, will take time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These exigencies may serve as a necessary push for the semiconductor industry to step into a new phase of fabrication. Chipmakers are already concerned about reaching the maximum transistor density allowable by current two-dimensional production methods. Potential three-dimensional methods, such as carbon nanotubes, are seen by some as less viable due to higher costs and manufacturing difficulties compared to easier 2-D architectures. While carbon nanotubes also depend on another critical mineral, graphite, they have already shown promise in various applications and could see wider deployment if cheaper alternatives become less viable—or there could be another production method yet to gain attention and investment. Whether through a known but novel production method or a yet-to-be-industrialized one, the cost and time burden of adopting next-generation chip architectures, materials, or processes will only make business sense if current methods or materials become more expensive or unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recycling&quot;&gt;Recycling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Congress to effectively invest in identifying or expanding sources of gallium and germanium, it should prioritize incentivizing recycling and investing in research to improve recycling processes in the United States. The Department of Commerce’s incentives program should be expanded to encourage private sector investment in building recycling facilities, using recycled materials, and exploring new methods of recycling gallium and germanium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current research on gallium and germanium processing from solid waste shows promise, with many researchers searching for more efficient recycling methods. One analysis of the field in early 2024 revealed several underused sources: gallium can be sourced from waste LEDs and dust from LED production, while germanium is recoverable from the significant waste generated by continuous technological upgrades, as well as wastewater from processes like fiber-optic cable production. Researchers are testing and evaluating various recycling and extraction methods, some with lower environmental impact, others with improved efficiency, and some that enhance the ability to extract multiple types of critical minerals from polymetallic resources (resources containing more than one critical mineral). Notably, much of this research appears to be conducted by Chinese scientists and research teams, funded by government and higher education grants. It is vital that the United States directs research funding toward this work, with an emphasis on environmental standards and worker safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cleaner-safer-extraction&quot;&gt;Cleaner, Safer Extraction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, funds should be appropriated for the NSTC and NIST to explicitly support research into cleaner mining and processing methods for gallium and germanium. For the Minerals Security Partnership or other initiatives to scale up nonexploitative and environmentally friendly mining to succeed, the United States must lead in finding economically practical methods that fulfill these objectives. While incentivizing private companies to conduct this research is possible, enabling higher-education institutions and other tech research hubs to make these discoveries increases the likelihood of broader benefits beyond a single corporation. Currently, private companies typically use proprietary practices for mineral processing, making it difficult to understand the factors controlling recovery and how processes could be improved. If funding is appropriated for a private sector intervention, building in incentives for companies to not only enhance these practices but also share knowledge could be impactful. As with the current CHIPS Act funding, receiving these funds should be contingent on applicants’ plans to base their operations in the United States or a friendly country and their commitment to positive environmental and labor practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-chips-with-next-generation-materials&quot;&gt;Building Chips with Next-Generation Materials&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the materials or combinations that will facilitate the next breakthrough in chip technology is a long-term project. Several types of investments will support the research needed to achieve this, but these discoveries can often come from unexpected fields. Beyond specific investments, the United States should broadly invest in basic R&amp;amp;D, focusing on areas the market may not fund but that, over time, could lead to paradigm-shifting discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the CHIPS Act’s “family” of agencies and projects, additional funding explicitly aimed at identifying new materials or architectures using more common materials would be impactful. CHIPS for America’s Metrology Program is already funding research on measurements—a key part of materials characterization—but it received limited funding under the CHIPS Act. Introducing an explicit research area for materials or architectures to the Microelectronics Commons would automatically encourage higher education and commercial institutions across multiple states to focus on this field while also emphasizing the commercialization of any new discoveries. The Microelectronics Commons offers the added benefit of allowing institutions to contribute their expert insights, replacing incomplete government guidance with field-specific expertise. Additionally, allocating specific funding for advanced materials research to NIST’s CHIPS Act funding would provide fresh resources for the U.S. government’s ongoing materials science efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, CHIPS Act–style funding should incentivize companies to adopt new processes and architectures that utilize novel materials. While market pressures likely will drive the adoption of discoveries that improve the efficiency of critical minerals use, advancing the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing will require government investment. This includes funding research to discover new materials, processes, or architectures and supporting the lab-to-fab transition for these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-5&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, U.S. legislative action on critical minerals has been tentative in addressing minerals relevant to semiconductor production. The process of identifying alternative sources for gallium and germanium will be expensive, likely slow, and possibly painful, but it is necessary to reduce the United States’ 100 percent dependence on imports, particularly from China. The United States must prioritize recycling of technological waste and mining byproducts, invest in research for more efficient extraction and recycling processes, and work with companies already active in these industries. Basic R&amp;amp;D investment will also be key to transitioning from this period of uncertain and costly mineral access to a leap forward into the next generation of semiconductor fabrication and architecture—if such advancements are indeed possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Critical minerals are used ubiquitously in commercial and defense systems and are therefore vitally important to national and economic security.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical minerals are used ubiquitously in commercial and defense systems and are therefore vitally important to national and economic security. On February 24, 2021, President Joe Biden issued Executive Order (EO) 14017, which called for a comprehensive review of critical supply chains in key sectors—one being critical minerals and other identified strategic materials, including rare earth elements (REEs). The first deliverable of the EO required four government agencies to submit 100-day reports on four different sectors. The Department of Defense (DOD) wrote and published the report on critical minerals and strategic materials, with input from multiple other agencies, on June 8, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second deliverable of the EO called for the DOD and other agencies to write a one-year report on their supply chains. The DOD’s report, Securing Defense-Critical Supply Chains, was published in February 2022. It identified five key focus areas that were at high risk for the DOD, mostly due to adversarial foreign dependence within those supply chains. Critical minerals and strategic materials comprised one of the five areas, and the one-year report provided an update on the implementation of the recommendations from the 100-day report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD’s Industrial Base Policy (IBP) office authored both reports. That office also manages two investment programs designed to mitigate shortfalls in the defense industrial base: the Defense Production Act (DPA) Title III program and the Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) program. Since the publication of the EO 14017 one-year report, IBP has used the report’s recommendations as a framework for making investments with both programs. Many of those investments are for onshoring capabilities that the United States has lost or for leveraging the capabilities of allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD’s IBP office also authored the report in response to EO 13806, Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States, published in September 2018, and the Annual Industrial Capabilities Report to Congress, submitted yearly. Both reports also detailed the fragility of the critical minerals supply chain; however, it was not until the EO 14017 report that the IBP office purposely aligned its investment programs for critical minerals with that report’s recommendations. Additionally, the DPA Title III base budget significantly increased starting in FY 2021, allowing for increased investments to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defense Production Act of 1950 authorizes the president to ensure the availability of U.S. and Canadian industry for U.S. defense, essential civilian, and homeland security requirements. The DPA is required to be reauthorized every few years, allowing Congress to make changes, such as expanding it to include space activity in 1975 and designating energy as an essential material good in 1980. Emergency preparedness during natural disasters or emergencies was added in 1994, and in 2003, the definition of national defense was expanded to include “critical infrastructure protection and restoration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the DPA only has three active authorities (although it has had more in the past): Title I, Title III, and Title VII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title I&lt;/strong&gt; is for defense priorities and allocations, and includes provisions for the DOD to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prioritize federal contracts over all other orders;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;control distribution of scarce materials within the civilian economy;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;allocate scarce materials against federal or private contracts; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prevent hoarding of scarce materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title III&lt;/strong&gt; is for expansion of productive capacity and supply, which includes incentives for the DOD to develop, maintain, modernize, and expand production capacity for critical technologies via&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense-production-act-title-iii-1&quot;&gt;DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TITLE III&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section focuses exclusively on DPA Title III. Grants and subsidies are the most common use of this title. The three priority areas for DPA Title III investment are (1) sustaining critical production, (2) commercializing research and development efforts, and (3) scaling emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DPA Title III has made investments in the United States and Canada, which is considered a “domestic source” for the purposes of the DPA. Canada has significant mining and material processing capability and exports a variety of strategic and critical materials to the United States. The FY 2024 National Defense Authorization Act gave DPA Title III the ability to consider Australia and the United Kingdom as domestic sources as well. This consideration could be critically important, as Australia is rich in mineral resources and has vast deposits of a large variety of critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any investment made by DPA Title III requires the president, on a nondelegable basis, to identify a domestic industrial base shortfall as meeting three specific criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industrial resource, material, or critical technology item is essential to national defense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without presidential action under 50 U.S.C. §4533, U.S. industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the capability for the needed industrial resource, material, or critical technology item in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §4533 are the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative methods for meeting the need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these criteria are met, the DOD assembles a package with justifying information and sends it to the White House for approval. Once signed by the president, it is known as a presidential determination (PD). PDs are non-expiring, can be leveraged for different projects addressing the same shortfalls, and vary in breadth and scope depending upon the shortfall or challenge addressed. PDs are not an appropriation or funding mechanism, nor a mandate to address a specific shortfall or pursue a specific course of action. Examples of existing PDs related to critical minerals include the “Defense Production Act Title III Presidential Determination for Critical Materials in Large-Capacity Batteries,” signed by President Biden on March 31, 2022, and five PDs for REEs, signed on July 22, 2019—two for separation and processing capability (light and heavy), one for metal and alloy processing capability, and two for rare earth permanent magnets production (samarium cobalt and neodymium iron boron).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the same criteria necessary to obtain a PD explain why DPA Title III is an important mechanism for investing in critical minerals supply chains. DPA Title III funds are not to be used if other funding, for example, private investment or funding from other agencies, can be secured. The private sector is reluctant to make investments in critical minerals projects due to market price volatility for these materials. With China controlling most of the market and market pricing, many domestic and allied sources have been driven out of business—not exactly an attractive business case for private investors. While the Department of Energy (DOE) has been making significant investments in this sector, it has been focusing on areas that align with its mission, as outlined in their vision statement: supporting “clean energy transition and decarbonization of the energy, manufacturing, and transportation economies, while promoting safe, sustainable, economic, and environmentally just solutions.” This leads to investments in projects for alternate designs that require no critical materials, more efficient and environmentally friendly mining, and reclaiming minerals through recycling. While the DOD is in favor of and has also been investing in these types of projects, many of the critical minerals necessary for national security applications must still be mined and processed using traditional methods, so the DOD is making those investments using DPA Title III.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, funding is appropriated into the DPA Title III account annually, without specification on how it is to be spent, although Congress must be notified of planned expenditures. However, in the past few years, there has been an increased interest in the DPA from the executive and legislative branches and other government agencies, who are increasingly viewing DPA authorities as valuable tools to be leveraged against urgent, critical issues. For instance, in FY 2022, the DPA was appropriated $600 million by the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, part of which included expanded domestic capacity for strategic and critical minerals. Additionally, in FY 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act appropriated $500 million for enhanced use of the DPA. The funds were split equally between the DOE and DOD, with $250 million provided to the DOD to be applied to expanding capabilities for domestic mining, mineral processing, and related industrial sectors for large-capacity batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DPA Title III typically has a requirement for cost sharing from the companies receiving an award. The expectation is 50 percent of the total investment, but can be less depending on various factors, such as a company’s ability to fund the total cost-share amount. Some smaller companies, such as small businesses and startups, do not have the cash flow available to fund a 50 percent cost share, and in those cases, DPA Title III may absorb a larger percentage of the total cost of the project. However, such instances may result in less DPA Title III funding available to make other investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program also seeks to ensure that any investment it makes will lead to a sustainable capability not requiring further DPA Title III funding. One way to do this is with the seldom-used authority of purchases and purchase commitments. This allows the DOD to purchase or commit to purchasing a certain amount of a company’s output over a set time period to ensure it can sustain the capability until market demand is sufficient to do so. This guaranteed demand also gives industry the confidence it needs to make its own investments. Purchases and purchase commitments were more easily executed previously because DPA Title III funds were appropriated as “no-year money,” meaning the funds never expired; however, during the past three years, Congress has appropriated those funds as standard procurement, which expire in two years, making these longer-term commitments nearly impossible. This change was due to some members’ concerns over timely execution rates; however, these concerns were unfounded, as the DPA Title III program executed $850 million of its $968 million budget in FY 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to offset some of the additional costs to the DPA Title III program and to help increase the demand for the newly developed capabilities, the program has recently developed its Pathfinders program, which “takes a revolutionary approach, focused on harnessing private capital and market forces to serve as a massive force multiplier to government investment.” The Defense Business Accelerator (DBX) program rapidly scales emerging technologies from the defense industry as well as DOD labs by leveraging the commercial market to accelerate production at scale. According to the DOD, “Since it was announced last fall, companies that received DBX awards are reporting they have received an additional $46.6 million in private capital, largely due to the spark provided by the initial $9.6 million DBX investment.” The Defense Market Catalyst (DMC) program is a public-private partnership (PPP) that stimulates trusted private capital for defense-oriented small businesses seeking to rapidly scale their operations to meet defense market needs. This capital infusion may also help those companies meet their cost-share obligations. And the Scaling Capacity &amp;amp; Accelerating Local Enterprises (SCALE) project looks at emerging technology through the lens of supply chain gaps, generating market pull and building PPPs to grow resilient domestic businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;industrial-base-analysis-and-sustainment-program&quot;&gt;INDUSTRIAL BASE ANALYSIS AND SUSTAINMENT PROGRAM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) program (10 U.S. Code §4817 established the Industrial Base Fund) was established in 2011 and has the following authorities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to support the monitoring and assessment of the industrial base&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to address critical issues in the industrial base relating to urgent operational needs&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to support efforts to expand the industrial base&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to address supply chain vulnerabilities&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only changes to the authority have been administrative in nature, such as amending the language to reflect the change from the “undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics” to the “undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment.” Congress does not prescribe how the base funding for the IBAS program (roughly $11 million in FY 2024) is to be spent; however, in the past several years, Congress has added a large amount of funding (around $1 billion in FY 2024) for specific industrial investment areas, for example, $175,692 for critical minerals in FY 2024. The IBAS program has always had the ability to and has made investments in all of the National Technology Industrial Base countries—Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the DPA Title III and IBAS programs have been making multiple investments in the critical minerals sector and have been investing in upstream and downstream capabilities to build and secure domestic critical minerals supply chains. Table 1 shows all the critical minerals investments that have been made during the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investments have been made in a multitude of different critical minerals, including both light and heavy REEs, aluminum, cobalt, nickel, lithium, graphite, titanium, manganese, and terbium oxide. Projects range from mining (cobalt, manganese ore, and lithium) to REE separation and magnet making (NdFeB). They also include production of titanium, of which the DOD gets 95 percent from non-domestic sources, including Russia, and production of aluminum, both of which are used in the production of aircraft, ships, and submarines. There is also an investment in Chinese export-restricted graphite. Additionally, there are several recycling projects, including extracting REEs from acid mine drainage and production of terbium oxide from recycled fluorescent light bulbs. There is even a workforce development project that was awarded in August 2024. While these projects span a wide breadth of the critical minerals landscape, there are still some gaps. For instance, there are no investments in samarium cobalt magnets or for gallium or germanium, for which China recently restricted exports. This may be due to a lack of funding, as DPA Title III must fund many different industrial base sector shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures 2 and 3 show the road maps for combined DPA Title III and IBAS current and future investments for strategic and critical materials and batteries, both of which contain projects for critical minerals. There continue to be investments in REE projects. Investments are also being made in niobium and tungsten, materials that go into refractory metals and superalloys and are used for components such as turbine engine blades and penetrators. Additionally, there are now projects for germanium and gallium, as well as additional recycling and workforce projects. Mining and refining of the main elements used in battery production—nickel, cobalt, lithium, and manganese—continue to be the focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-3&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the DOD has made significant investments—totaling $781 million—in the critical minerals sector to onshore or friend-shore capabilities and reduce U.S. dependencies on adversarial sourcing during the Biden administration, there is still much to be done. It has taken decades for these capabilities to atrophy, and it will take many years and many more millions of dollars to rebuild them. More investment dollars are needed, especially if the government’s predicted timeline (by roughly 2027) for Chinese readiness for a potential invasion of Taiwan is to be believed. If the United States were to come to Taiwan’s aid, it is unlikely that China would continue to provide the country with critical minerals. Therefore, the capability for critical minerals production must be rebuilt quickly, before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the DPA Title III budget is used to address a multitude of industrial base shortfalls, not just critical minerals. Even though the total budget may seem large, the amount available for critical minerals is not enough to address the considerable gap that exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased appropriations for both the DPA Title III and IBAS programs would allow for greater investments in critical minerals. The DPA Title III base budget increased from $373 million in FY 2023 to $588 million in FY 2024, but the program demonstrated it could execute much more ($850 million). Appropriating a base budget for DPA Title III that is at least $750 million to $1 billion would give the program the flexibility to invest more in critical minerals while maintaining or increasing investments in other important sectors. The IBAS program has consistently shown it can execute annual budgets at or near $1 billion, so appropriating a base budget in that range would help ensure consistency for critical minerals investments, rather than relying on inconsistent congressional additions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several other recommendations that would help improve the ability of the DPA Title III program to impact the critical minerals landscape:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegate authority for approval of PDs to the secretary of defense.&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, it takes approximately one year to staff the PD package and obtain the president’s signature. This timeline needs to be shortened to allow for more responsive industrial base investments. The secretary of defense is well positioned to understand the national security implications of the threat and can confer with the heads of other departments and agencies who may have equities, prior to signing a designation for the use of DPA Title III authorities for a particular critical minerals industrial base shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make greater use of purchases and purchase commitments.&lt;/strong&gt; As mentioned earlier, purchases and purchase commitments will help sustain the capabilities that have received investments and provide industry with the demand signal and business case to make their own investments. Greater utilization of this authority will rely on two factors: an increased budget and a return to non-expiring funding being appropriated by Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase investments in the workforce.&lt;/strong&gt; The workforce shortage is one of the key issues in all sectors of the industrial base, as was highlighted in the DOD’s EO 14017 report. The IBAS program has been making investments in the workforce for several years, but the DPA Title III program has traditionally not made such investments, primarily due to a smaller overall budget. The IBAS program has been very successful with its National Imperative for Industrial Skills (NIIS) initiative, which facilitates multiple approaches to recruit, train, hire, and retain skilled workers. The NIIS initiative recognizes the interplay of K–12 and post-secondary education and training tracks. The key principles of the program are (1) active, sustained partnering with industry, academia, military departments, federal agencies, and state governments; and (2) creating regionally focused activities targeting capacity where skills are most needed (e.g., regional submarine industrial base efforts intensified and scaled in New England and Virginia). Additional funding would enable both programs to support additional workforce development efforts in key sectors, such as critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue to leverage private equity and venture capital.&lt;/strong&gt; Private capital will multiply the impact of DPA Title III funding and assist small companies that lack the cash flow to fund cost share for awards. It will also mean DPA Title III does not have to absorb the extra cost, allowing those funds to be allocated to other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue to work with commercial industry to generate market pull and demand.&lt;/strong&gt; The DOD’s demand in this sector is very small, so it is vital that commercial industry helps generate part of the demand signal to develop resilient and sustainable domestic supply chains. For instance, the automotive industry also uses rare earth magnets in electric motors and sensors, as well as lithium batteries in electric vehicles. Other critical commercial technologies, such as cell phones, are equally dependent on these materials. While commercial industries may not view dependency on China from a national security perspective, they should be concerned from an economic security and liability perspective. In such cases, the DOD should continue to work with these industries to help provide the necessary demand signal to sustain a domestic capability for these materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD recognizes the importance of critical minerals to national security. These minerals are present in nearly all the weapons systems and platforms the DOD purchases and uses. Although the department’s demand is small compared to the commercial sector, the criticality of these materials drives it to make investments to ensure a secure supply. The investment strategy is derived from recommendations in the DOD’s report in response to EO 14017, which identified strategic and critical materials as one of the five key focus areas at risk for the DOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DPA Title III and the IBAS programs, both led by DOD’s IBP office, have made and continue to make investments in the critical minerals industrial base. The IBP office is also coordinating with and leveraging investments made by other U.S. agencies (e.g., the DOE) as well as allies and partners (e.g., Canada and Australia). Beyond increased funding, the additional recommendations outlined in this chapter would help strengthen the DOD’s ability to secure the critical minerals supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The MSP has successfully seeded the importance of mineral security in the global resource discourse.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nternational cooperation is one of the key pillars of the U.S. government strategy to help address vulnerabilities in the nation’s supply chains for critical minerals. In this context, the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) is one major diplomatic initiative that specifically focuses on this issue. The MSP has successfully seeded the importance of mineral security in the global resource discourse, elevated critical minerals as a focus of U.S. resource diplomacy, and mobilized a coalition of market democracies to diversify global mineral supply chains. With several modifications, the MSP—as well as U.S. leadership through it—has the potential for a more dynamic, long-term, and durable presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;membership-and-objectives&quot;&gt;MEMBERSHIP AND OBJECTIVES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announced at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) convention in Toronto in June 2022, the MSP has seen its number of partners grow from 10 countries plus the European Union to 14 countries plus the European Union in the two years since its inception. Some partners are global leaders in advanced technology manufacturing that are highly import dependent on component minerals, while others are mineral-rich advanced economies. A common thread appears to be the desire to see the global supply chains for critical minerals become more diversified and resilient to disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSP focuses on the full value chains—from mining to recycling—for minerals and metals that are “most relevant for clean energy technologies,” such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, graphite, rare earth elements (REEs), and copper. In its own words, the MSP addresses four areas of major critical minerals challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diversifying and stabilizing global supply chains;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investment in those supply chains;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promoting high environmental, social, and governance standards in the mining, processing, and recycling sectors; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing recycling of critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In engaging mineral-rich third countries, the MSP is committed to ensuring that “minerals are produced, processed, and recycled in a way that helps countries realize the full economic benefits of their resources.” In fact, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations are the defining value proposition to mineral-rich countries, as exemplified by repeated emphasis on these issues in press releases and remarks by MSP leadership. The partnership positions itself as a global advocate for high ESG standards and a promoter of benefiting host localities. As such, resource-rich countries seeking MSP support are expected to demonstrate transparency around bidding processes and the engagement of local communities, while MSP partner countries and their firms are expected to adhere to high ESG standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative has emphasized the role of private investment and the importance of transparency in making global mineral supply chains more diversified, robust, and resilient. While the global mining industry has a few leading companies (commonly known as “mining majors”) from market economies—such as Australia, the European Union, and the United Kingdom—the global supply chains for minerals for the energy transition are currently dominated by Chinese companies, whose ascent was facilitated by government support. MSP leaders likely judged—correctly—that reducing China’s preeminence would require private capital to augment the budgetary stream from its partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prospective projects, submitted by MSP partners and driven by their companies, are not geographically limited to partner jurisdictions. Proposals are screened and then further evaluated by the project working group based on the investment climate, the need for the mineral, and the potential for investment. The MSP supports selected projects by amplifying their efforts to attract investment and secure financing in various forms, including by offering political support, technical guidance, loans, political risk insurance, or financing through export promotion banks or export credit agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;major-developments-and-achievements&quot;&gt;MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of September 2024, the MSP has begun supporting about 30 projects: 16 on upstream mining and mineral extraction, 7 on midstream processing, and 7 on recycling and recovery. These projects collectively source cobalt, copper, gallium, germanium, graphite, lithium, manganese, nickel, and REEs from around the world, including at least 13 projects in Africa, 6 in the Americas, 5 in Europe, and 3 in the Asia-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No single, official repository of MSP projects—including project terms and progresses—seems to exist in the public domain, but support has come in various forms. U.S. contributions through the MSP have included a $3.4 million technical assistance grant by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) for Pensana Rare Earths in Angola, a nonbinding DFC letter expressing potential loan provisions for Kabanga Nickel in Tanzania, and a nonbinding letter of interest by the Export-Import Bank of the United States (U.S. EXIM) for potential debt financing of up to $600 million toward the REE-focused Dubbo Project in Australia. Other MSP partner support has included the arrangement of a $105 million debt facility by the German KfW IPEX-Bank toward a graphite project in Tanzania, as well as a mineral-related coordination framework between Congolese commodity-trading and mining company La Générale des Carrières et des Mines (Gécamines) and the government-affiliated Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC) that aims to advance coordination in mineral exploration, production, and processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major institutional development was the April 2024 establishment of the MSP Forum, which was set up to “deepen and cement the MSP’s partnership with mineral-producing countries.” Cochaired by the United States and European Union, the MSP Forum has two work streams, one focusing on project development and the other on policy dialogues. Operationally, the project component will be led by the United States, and its scope “may include project information sharing among MSP partners, Forum members, and the private sector,” as well as technical collaboration. The policy dialogue component, led by the European Union, might cover sustainable production, boosting local capacities, regulatory cooperation, application of high ESG standards, and effective recycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the forum has expanded the MSP’s operational scope beyond identifying and supporting projects—likely in an effort to dispel the perception that MSP engagement is a new form of resource colonialism by advanced industrialized economies to exploit mineral-rich countries to fuel their industrial needs. While the forum likely helps increase the quality of communications between the MSP partners and forum members (i.e., mineral-rich, non-partner countries), membership does not seem to afford access—automatic or direct—to financial or technical assistance from the MSP, including access to benefits under the provisions of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. It remains to be seen whether the forum will effectively advance confidence building between the MSP partner countries and MSP Forum members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, in September 2024, development finance institutions and export credit agencies of the MSP partner governments established the MSP Finance Network. Aiming to “strengthen cooperation and promote information exchange and co-financing,” the network includes nearly 30 participating institutions, including the DFC and U.S. EXIM. This long-warranted development could enhance the scope and depth of MSP support, especially through the successful facilitation of cofinancing by multiple public and private institutions from MSP partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-in-advancing-msp-goals&quot;&gt;CHALLENGES IN ADVANCING MSP GOALS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the MSP has furthered collective efforts to diversify global supply chains for minerals and metals that are important for the energy transition, several challenges have become evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;clarity-of-purpose&quot;&gt;Clarity of Purpose&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting forward ESG as the MSP’s preeminent value proposition likely stems from the desire of this U.S.-led group of advanced industrialized democracies to distinguish its global minerals activities from those of China. In fact, Chinese-owned mining projects in the Global South have increasingly become subject to ESG scrutiny, as civil society has reported and analyzed. For example, the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, a corporate watchdog, identified 102 alleged abuses—both human rights and environmental violations linked to Chinese companies’ mining operations overseas, spanning 18 countries—from January 2021 to December 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even though the MSP seeks to actively “advocate” for high ESG standards—which form its core principles and shape the key criteria in mineral project selection, including the vetting of host countries and investor companies—the MSP has limited operational latitude on this front. The partnership is not set up to formulate its own set of standards or enforce a single set of standards for minerals production, processing, or recycling. Instead, it defers to each partner country to apply and enforce its own standards, hoping to strike a delicate balance between respecting the judicial sovereignty of its individual partners and advancing ESG goals. While such pragmatism likely accords flexibility to MSP operations and agility to its inner workings, it may be obscuring the precise value proposition of the MSP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to ascertain whether—and to what extent—the application of high ESG standards might have limited the number of MSP projects approved or slowed the pace of project selection. Meeting ESG goals entails a long-term commitment that has not come easily even in advanced industrialized democracies. For example, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act set the stage for financial disclosure under the auspices of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) related to conflict minerals. However, the SEC has stopped enforcing actions against noncompliant companies as of 2017. Therefore, the MSP might reassess the degree to which the application of high ESG standards should dictate its activities. The combination of the robust growth outlook for critical minerals demand and the extreme geographical concentration of mining and processing capacities generates an unprecedented sense of urgency in diversifying and expanding mineral supplies and supply chains. While few would likely dispute the importance of ESG concerns, there appears to be merit in recalibrating how ESG standards interact with the MSP’s objective of “diversifying and stabilizing global supply chains” for critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financial-support&quot;&gt;Financial Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other major challenge for U.S. engagement with the MSP concerns financing. The primary tool for the U.S. government to unlock private capital for development needs is the DFC, which was created through the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act of 2018. The DFC can use direct loans and loan guarantees, political risk insurance and reinsurance, equity investment, feasibility studies, and technical assistance to support private investments in low- and lower-middle-income countries. It can also support activities in upper-middle-income countries “if such support is certified to have U.S. economic or foreign policy interests at stake and is designed for development impact.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a misalignment between where the mineral resources are and the income classification of the host countries. Many prospective projects that could unlock additional supplies of critical minerals are in countries that are not in low- or lower-middle-income categories, including Australia (which has 28 percent of the global reserves of lithium and 21 percent of nickel), Brazil (which has 22 percent of graphite and 16 percent of nickel), Chile (which has 36 percent of lithium), and Indonesia (which has 21 percent of nickel). Yet both Brazil and Indonesia are upper-middle-income countries, while Australia and Chile are high-income countries, based on World Bank classifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFC has a variety of tools to facilitate private investments in not only minerals production projects, but also infrastructure projects (e.g., roads and ports) that support the extractive sector (e.g., mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction). However, DFC support for extractive projects has been extremely limited. Only 14 of the 1,345 projects supported by the DFC and its predecessor agencies since 1999 are in the extractive sector. The pace is picking up, however. Nine of these fourteen projects have been approved since 2020, including six that are related to minerals and metals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of support for the six projects varies from technical assistance to equity investments, but the equity investment has been limited to two projects to date. The $105 million of equity is ring-fenced to two of TechMet’s projects—an REE recovery project in South Africa and a nickel and cobalt project in Brazil. The DFC has given a $150 million loan to Twigg Exploration and Mining for graphite mining and processing operations in Mozambique. If the United States is to lead in strengthening and diversifying the global supply chains for critical minerals away from China, greater DFC support for minerals projects will be essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-4&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSP is a major multilateral platform in which the U.S. government has invested a considerable amount of diplomatic capital. Several areas are ripe for improvement and modifications, however, and the United States should pursue the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extend the MSP’s scope to include technical assistance.&lt;/strong&gt; The MSP plays a valuable coordinating role by bringing together key stakeholders and helping to identify and support minerals projects. One area in which the partnership could expand its support is technical assistance to MSP Forum members, especially in the form of geological surveys and resource mapping. Many mineral resources remain unmapped or under-mapped. For example, the absence of a systematic geological survey is one impediment to unlocking Africa’s mineral resource potential. In contrast to surveys conducted by an individual developer, even if it were from an MSP partner country, such mapping could become a communal asset that helps unlock private capital and could aid junior mining companies whose financial resources are more limited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better align DFC parameters with MSP objectives.&lt;/strong&gt; The following adjustments and modifications would make the DFC better equipped to aid the United States’ role in the MSP, in turn empowering the partnership and granting it more operational flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove the certification requirement for upper-middle-income countries for project that contribute to critical minerals value chains.&lt;/strong&gt; Critical minerals projects, ranging from extraction to recycling, have “U.S. economic or foreign policy interests” by nature, given the importance and urgency of supply chain diversification. This modification would not negate the importance of screening proposed projects for compliance with other DFC policies but could help redress the existing misalignment between where needed minerals are and the income classification of host countries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relax the restriction against support to a majority state-owned or state-controlled entity.&lt;/strong&gt; DFC financing is presently geared toward private sector endeavors in the developing world. However, restricting this support to companies that are mostly privately owned or controlled hinders the DFC’s ability to engage key entities in the mining sector. For example, Gécamines, whose commanding ownership of cobalt and copper in Africa has made its coordination agreement with JOGMEC a highlight of recent MSP endeavors, is a state-controlled mining company. In some undertapped mineral-rich countries, the resources are wholly owned or controlled by the state. While reasons vary depending on the country and mineral, the state ownership of minerals can be a result of the process of nationalization that occurred in connection with the decolonialization of developing countries. Permitting DFC support for state-owned entities could help enhance the institution’s operational reach in a sector where the distinction between public and private may not be highly relevant—especially given the historical complexity regarding mineral ownership and the very notion of equity that the MSP Forum seeks to advance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Begin considering a state financing tool that is not tied to an overseas development mandate.&lt;/strong&gt; While the above modifications merit serious consideration as Congress focuses on DFC reauthorization in 2025, it is also worth exploring if they merit establishing an institutional capacity similar to that of JOGMEC. Affiliated with Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI), JOGMEC has the authority to make strategic investments abroad to enhance Japan’s energy security. Free of restrictions on state ownership or control and income classification, JOGMEC support in the minerals sector around the world has included subsidies to 54 exploration projects, investment and loans to 23 exploration projects (including joint interest acquisition with Japanese companies), and loan guarantees to 8 mine development projects. The most notable accomplishment is JOGMEC’s strategic investment in Australia—a high-income country outside the DFC support scope—in the aftermath of the 2010 Chinese embargo on REE exports to Japan. The $250 million loan and equity deal to Lynas helped diversify Japan’s REE supply sources while also saving the company from bankruptcy. Lynas now produces 12 percent of the world’s rare earth oxides and meets one-third of Japan’s overall REE supply needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-6&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minerals Security Partnership illustrates the collective desire of partner countries to counter China’s dominance of global mineral supply chains. Whether the MSP can successfully turn this desire into collective support for economically viable and politically durable projects has significant implications for the pace of diversifying global supply chains and strengthening U.S. mineral security. Modifications to the MSP and DFC could put a new U.S. administration in a better position to succeed in addressing these pressing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In recent years, both Democratic and Republican presidents and bipartisan members of Congress have increasingly expressed the need to streamline permitting for new mine projects that are environmentally and socially responsible.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With domestic mineral demand forecasted to soar due to America’s burgeoning re-industrialization and overseas mineral supplies imperiled by jurisdictional and shipping risks, members of the U.S. executive branch and Congress increasingly support a modernized permitting system that facilitates the development of domestic mining projects. They also generally back high permitting standards for safety, health, labor, emissions, and the environment, as well as Tribal consultation and community engagement. This emerging bipartisan consensus presents an opportunity for federal agencies to update rules and for Congress to pass laws streamlining permitting for new mines that are environmentally and socially responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter addresses the federal permitting process for new U.S. mines that extract hardrock minerals such as copper and nickel. It focuses predominantly on permitting for mine development—that is, building the mine—rather than exploration, production, or reclamation because permitting for mine development is more extensive than permitting for exploration and must also consider production and reclamation. This chapter first provides a historical overview of mine permitting in the United States before describing the current system of mine permitting. The final section recommends actions to the president and Congress to streamline permitting for domestic sustainable mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;historical-overview&quot;&gt;HISTORICAL OVERVIEW&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of mine permitting in the United States can be categorized into three parts: mining expansion, mining efficiency, and environmental protection. For nearly its first hundred years of existence, the U.S. government—both the executive branch and Congress—deferred on establishing a general mining law or code. U.S. courts mainly applied English laws and decisions when mining issues emerged, which rarely occurred. However, the U.S. government’s acquisition of mineral-rich western territories and the resulting legal questions necessitated concrete U.S. laws and regulations. The U.S. government initially sought to generate revenue by leasing certain lands for mineral development, including lead and copper mines, but the system largely failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in 1866, the federal government enacted a law declaring that federal public lands with minerals are “free and open to exploration” by U.S. citizens and those intending to become citizens, in alignment with “the local customs or rules of miners in the several mining districts.” Amendments to this law were enacted in 1870, and the Mining Act of 1872 ultimately clarified the process for individuals to explore public lands and, upon making a mineral discovery, to acquire mineral rights and develop mineral claims. Given the prevailing national interest to incentivize mineral development, there were low federal fees and no federal royalties for mining on these lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, English common law usually applied to mineral development on the private lands east of the Missouri River, while the mining laws of 1866, 1870, and 1872 generally pertained to mineral development in the public lands west of the river. These mining laws indeed proved successful in expanding U.S. mineral production. (See the timeline at end of the chapter for a record of major U.S. federal laws affecting hardrock mining.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government tied the national welfare to the continued productivity of the mining industry, so amid declining ore grades in the 1910s, its attitude toward mining shifted to encompass not only development but also efficiency—that is, minimizing waste in the mining process. As long as mining companies sought to reduce wasteful mining, the government generally urged a permissive view toward their activities. It even prioritized efficiency during World War I, largely maintaining its system for permitting mines on public lands. Still, the U.S. government lacked a national mining policy that applied to both public and non-public lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government attitudes into the mid-1930s continued to emphasize mining efficiency. With the expansion of military programs and eventually the outbreak of World War II, the U.S. government sought to increase its mineral supply through federal mineral stockpiles and subsidies to mineral projects rather than permitting actions for the development of new mines. Meanwhile, it continued to urge mining efficiency and minimizing waste. The most notable permitting action in the 1940s was Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946, which authorized hardrock mineral leasing on acquired public lands and was anchored by prior laws like the Act of March 4, 1917. During the Korean War, the U.S. government adopted similar stockpiling, subsidy, and mining efficiency policies as it did during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some mines developed before and during this period had serious negative impacts on human health and the environment, including releases of pollutants that contaminated groundwater and surface water. Starting in the late 1950s, members of Congress increasingly sought to pass laws to help protect the environment. Many of these bills aimed to balance mineral development with environmental protections. In 1969, Congress passed one of its most consequential pieces of environmental legislation, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and it was signed into law in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of the law’s passage, the most noted part of NEPA was the creation of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), which was tasked with creating new environmental programs and directing federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their own programs. But the most significant part of NEPA would arguably become Section 102. This section broadly outlines the NEPA administration process for federal agencies, including environmental impact statements (EISs) for “major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.” Major federal actions ultimately came to encompass federal agencies issuing certain permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the enactment of NEPA, U.S. mine development slowed amid higher costs associated with environmental compliance, as well as higher energy, capital, and labor costs. In 1970, U.S. mineral exploration and development work declined for the first time since 1966, and mineral exploration and development work declined again the following year. The U.S. Bureau of Mines noted at the time that health, safety, and environmental requirements “strongly influenced” U.S. mineral development. In 1972, U.S. exploration and development work declined for the third-straight year amid the growing costs of environmental regulations and health and safety standards. Congress that year passed several additional laws concerning the environment, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments, which largely created the modern Clean Water Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mineral exploration and development work declined further in 1973, and additional environmental regulations contributed to higher costs for U.S. mines through the rest of the 1970s. Capital expenditures per ton of output in the mining industry increased from $25–$30 per ton in the early 1970s to $75–$90 per ton in 1976. Many new mines and capacity expansions were delayed or canceled. Mine development not only became costlier but also took longer: By some estimates, the development timeline for U.S. mineral projects in 1976 was 15 years. For permitting alone, a U.S. Forest Service (USFS) official estimated that the minimum processing time for a mineral lease and mining plan was 3 years. Concerns thus arose in the 1970s that the NEPA process took too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These concerns persist regarding the cost and length of the federal permitting process for new mines. As discussed in the next section, the laws and regulations that predominantly affect modern U.S. mine permitting today stem from laws and corresponding regulations enacted in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-current-system&quot;&gt;THE CURRENT SYSTEM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing a mine in the United States today requires federal, state, and local permits, authorizations, and compliance. Which permits are needed depends on the mine’s location and plan of operations. Mines located on public and non-public lands largely require the same federal permits, and a mine’s plan of operations affects which specific permits are required based on how the mine might impact health, safety, and the environment (see Table 1). For example, an underground mine that plans to backfill with mine tailings would require an Underground Injection Control permit under the Safe Drinking Water Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rhwN9DG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Federal Permitting Requirements for Most U.S. Hardrock Mines.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All mines require permits under federal programs, but the federal government has delegated permitting authority to the state governments for issuing certain permits. For instance, most state governments issue National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits pertaining to Section 402 of the Clean Water Act. Mines usually require NPDES permits because their plans of operations affect discharges for stormwater (e.g., rainwater) and mine contact water (e.g., runoff ). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) still retains oversight of state NPDES programs. Similarly, most state governments have permitting authority over Clean Air Act permits, yet the EPA again maintains oversight. These permits are often required for mines due to the crushing and dust associated with their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for permits needed directly from the federal government, mines generally need a Section 404 permit under the Clean Water Act. This permit is necessary if the mine’s plan of operations involves dredging or filling material—for example, installing a culvert for a stream crossing or building a storage facility for waste rock or tailings—in locations considered jurisdictional waters subject to the Clean Water Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all states except Michigan and New Jersey, the federal government via the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) retains authority over issuing Section 404 permits. The EPA maintains veto power over these permits in all states—and the EPA has exercised this veto, such as over the Pebble Mine project in Alaska. For the USACE to issue a Section 404 permit, the mine project must also receive Clean Water Act Section 401 certification—which the state government issues—and comply with Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, when a federal agency decides to grant a permit like a section 404 permit or approve a mine on public lands, it is considered a major federal action under NEPA and thus requires the lead federal agency to prepare an EIS. This process requires the lead federal agency to assess the environmental impacts of its proposed action and possible alternative actions, including no action. After receiving the mine application, plan, and related technical reports, the lead agency scopes the EIS, authors the draft EIS, prepares the final EIS, and issues a Record of Decision, which is the federal government’s final determination on whether to approve a project’s plan of operations (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ryZUVg4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Overview of National Environmental Policy Act’s Environmental Impact Statement Process.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors elaboration based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-04/r9-rtoc-presentation-mining-issues-breakout-spring-2023.pdf&quot;&gt;Environmental Protection Agency, “Mining Issues: EPA Region 9 Regional Tribal Operations Committee Meeting,” presentation, April 20, 2023, slide 18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a mine that seeks a section 404 permit on non-public lands, the USACE is the lead agency in the NEPA process. The EPA reviews and comments on the USACE’s EISs and can act as a cooperating agency. To illustrate the length of the process, the USACE’s average timeline in 2021 across all types of projects, from publishing a notice of intent for drafting an EIS to publishing a final EIS, was 5.8 years. The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 did establish a two-year timeline for the federal government to complete EISs, but the lead federal agency can extend the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tamarack Nickel project in Minnesota offers an example of this permitting process. Even though it is located wholly on non-public lands, including both state lands and private lands, federal permits are likely required, including a Section 404 permit under the Clean Water Act and, thus, Section 106 compliance under the National Historic Preservation Act and Section 7 compliance under the Endangered Species Act. Consequently, the project must follow the NEPA process, with the USACE expected as the lead agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hardrock mines on public lands, the lead federal agencies for NEPA reviews are either the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) within the Department of the Interior or the USFS within the Department of Agriculture. While the BLM administers mining claims on all public lands, including regulations for preventing “unnecessary or undue degradation” to public lands, the relevant surface management agency—either the BLM or the USFS—oversees the mine development. USFS regulations for mining are practically unaltered since 1974, and BLM regulations are largely unchanged since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, the BLM and USFS permit mines on public lands in the process depicted in Figure 2. For all types of projects reviewed by the USFS in 2021, the average timeline from publishing a notice of intent for drafting an EIS to publishing a final EIS was 5.8 years. For new hardrock mining projects approved by the BLM between FY 2013 and April 2024, the average timeline for the entire process—from the project appearing in the BLM’s records to the BLM authorizing ground-disturbing activities—was 4.6 years. Thus, regardless of the lead federal agency, the NEPA process can be expected to take around five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Mining Act of 1872, the BLM and USFS further regulate mining on public lands based on whether the public lands are non-acquired or acquired. Non-acquired public lands have always been federally owned, while acquired lands have been obtained by the federal government, such as through a purchase, gift, or condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On non-acquired public lands, the location system applies to hardrock minerals. After receiving authorization, firms and individuals can mine these minerals if the public lands are not closed or withdrawn from mineral entry and by paying a one-time $49 location fee, a $25 processing fee per new claim, and an annual $200 maintenance fee. Mineral production under the location system is not subject to a federal royalty, although some entities—including the Biden administration’s Interagency Working Group on Mining Laws, Regulations, and Permitting—supported imposing federal royalties on these minerals. Conversely, on acquired public lands, the leasing system applies to hardrock minerals. If the public lands are open to mineral activity, firms and individuals can mine these minerals after receiving authorization, but the mineral production is subject to federal royalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the above permitting process, the Thacker Pass lithium project in Nevada is on BLM-managed lands. Correspondingly, plans of operations and reclamation had to be submitted, and because approving the plan of operations was considered a major federal action, the BLM became the lead agency in the NEPA process. Although the plan of operations was received in September 2019 and the final Record of Decision was reached in January 2021, the project faced legal challenges until March 2024 concerning its potential impact on properties spiritually, culturally, and historically significant to several Tribes. Thus, even a relatively quick permitting process can be followed by lengthy litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another example, the Idaho Cobalt Operations is on USFS land. The USFS was, therefore, the lead agency in the NEPA process, with the EPA acting as a cooperating agency. With the mine’s plan of operations changing in 2006, it took eight years from the USFS publishing a notice of intent for drafting an EIS in 2001 to reaching a Record of Decision in 2009. As with many mine projects, the greatest environmental concerns were the mine’s potential impacts on surface water and groundwater. To mitigate these risks, the approved plan of operations addressed factors such as tailings and waste rock management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, certain types of mines can receive special permitting coverage under Title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41) of 2015. FAST-41 created the Permitting Council to streamline federal permitting by coordinating federal environmental permits and approvals for certain projects; it also created the Federal Permitting Dashboard to enhance permitting timeline transparency and predictability. In 2021, mining was added as a sector eligible for FAST-41 coverage. To be eligible, a mining project must meet different requirements depending on the specific criteria. For example, the “objective” criteria require that the project be subject to NEPA, need more than $200 million in investment, and not qualify for other expedited permitting processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2023, the Hermosa manganese-zinc project in Arizona became the first mining project covered by FAST-41. Although the Hermosa project will involve extensive mine development and mineral extraction on private lands, for which it will need state permits, the planned expansion of the mine operations will include USFS land, invoking the NEPA process and making the project eligible for FAST-41 benefits under the objective criteria. With FAST-41 coverage, the Hermosa project expects a more efficient permitting process, and it anticipates a Record of Decision in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-streamlining-the-process&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STREAMLINING THE PROCESS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government—both the executive branch and Congress—could improve the process for permitting new domestic mines by improving permitting clarity, cost, and timelines. An inefficient permitting regime dissuades those seeking to build new mine projects and can cause delays or even cancellation for projects in development. Thus, an inefficient permitting regime limits the pipeline of mines, and those projects take a long time to come online, both constraining and delaying new mineral supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streamlining permitting for environmentally and socially responsible new mines has garnered bipartisan federal support, including from both the Trump and Biden administrations. For example, the Trump administration’s Executive Order 13953 directed agency heads to, “as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, use all available authorities to accelerate the issuance of permits and the completion of projects in connection with expanding and protecting the domestic supply chain for minerals.” In Congress as well, members of both parties have sought to streamline permitting for mines, best evidenced by the Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024, introduced by Senators Joe Manchin (I-WV) and John Barrasso (R-WY).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following recommendations seek to promote sustainable mining, helping the United States strengthen its national security, grow its economic prosperity, and pursue its environmental objectives. Recommendations are specifically tailored for the federal government—both the executive branch and Congress—not state or local governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-to-the-president&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE PRESIDENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue a new rule that enhances Tribal consultation and community engagement with mine applicants in the NEPA process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To better address the input of Tribes and local communities affected by permitting new mines, the next presidential administration could issue a new rule that enhances Tribal consultation and community engagement in the NEPA process. An oft-cited study using 2021 data found that a majority of mine sites for nickel, copper, lithium, and cobalt in the United States are located within 35 miles of Native American reservations. In the NEPA process, however, federal agencies—not the mining applicants—are required to consult with the Tribal authorities, who have noted that this interaction is often not timely or constructive. This new rule should require mining companies to consult with the requisite Tribes and engage with the local communities according to set guidelines upon beginning the NEPA process, such as by conducting onsite tours, holding mandatory monthly meetings, and issuing automatic project notifications. Such engagement and consultation would help address issues and thus avoid lawsuits that may arise concerning the NEPA process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand FAST-41 coverage under the Permitting Council’s “discretionary” criteria to mining projects that will extract energy transition minerals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To increase the number of mining projects covered by FAST-41, the next president could direct the Permitting Council to exercise its voting authority under the discretionary criteria to cover more projects that will extract minerals on the Department of Energy’s “critical materials for energy” list. The only mining project covered by FAST-41 as of September 2024 is South32’s Hermosa project, despite mining projects having become eligible for FAST-41 coverage in January 2021. Under the objective criteria, a mining project like the Idaho Cobalt Operations would not have been eligible for FAST-41 coverage—even though the mine was subject to NEPA and did not qualify for other expedited permitting processes—because it required less than $200 million in investment. The Permitting Council could bypass the objective criteria’s total investment requirement by voting to cover specific mine projects that will extract energy transition minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue a new rule for the CEQ’s “intensity” factors that establishes clear thresholds for potentially significant impacts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help federal agencies ascertain if projects require EISs, the new administration’s CEQ could issue a new rule for “intensity” factors that establishes clear thresholds for potentially significant environmental impacts. Determining if a time-consuming EIS is required instead of a simpler environmental assessment (EA)—which can take roughly half the time to complete—depends on whether a major federal action (e.g., granting a federal permit) may significantly impact the environment. The lead agency in the NEPA process determines the significance based on the “context” and “intensity” of the action’s impact, and the CEQ defines the context and lists 10 intensity factors. A conclusion or “substantial question” that the action may have a significant impact for one factor triggers an EIS; however, the CEQ does not currently define thresholds for triggering each factor. A new rule that clarifies these definitions would enable agencies to pursue EAs when appropriate rather than favoring caution by immediately drafting an EIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-to-congress&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONGRESS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase funding for more agency staffing to support NEPA reviews.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To better ensure timely NEPA reviews, Congress could increase funding for agencies to hire more mineral experts. In 2016, BLM and USFS officials reported that field offices, which are the specific agency units leading the NEPA process, have limited mining expertise, causing delays. Additional staffing could enable agencies to engage in early planning meetings with mine project applicants and help reduce applicant-caused delays, such as submission of mine plans that lack adequate information and clarity. Thus, adequate staffing with the necessary expertise could help facilitate the NEPA process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase funding for permit applicants to offset costs associated with the permitting process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To help reduce the costs faced by mine applicants, Congress could appropriate more funding to defray permitting-related costs. Indeed, the Department of Defense already offers and has disbursed Defense Production Act Title III grants to mine projects to help cover costs related to the NEPA process. This financial support can be increased and expanded to cover additional costs. For instance, mine applicants generally have to pay for third-party contractors assisting in the NEPA process, yet the quality of these contractors varies and leads to corresponding delays. Congress could pass funding for permit applicants to hire approved contractors with a track record of responsive, high-quality work in the NEPA process, both reducing mine applicants’ compliance costs and streamlining the NEPA process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish categorical exclusions (CEs) for the construction, expansion, or modernization of mines that will produce energy transition minerals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To satisfy environmental requirements under NEPA while expediting permitting timelines, Congress could pass legislation—similar to the Building Chips in America Act of 2023—that treats the permitting of mines for energy transition minerals as categorically excluded from EA and EIS requirements. Illustrating the faster permitting timeline for CEs, the USFS took an average of seven months to complete a CE between 2005 and 2020. To be covered by the CE, a project must produce at least one energy transition mineral as the primary product. For example, an iron ore mine that produces neodymium as a byproduct would not be subject to a CE. Importantly, the covered energy transition minerals should be listed in the legislation and could include those minerals on the Department of Energy’s critical energy materials list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Timeline of Major U.S. Federal Laws That Affect Hardrock Mining.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-7&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of its history, Congress sought to impose a permitting regime that fostered and supported U.S. mineral development, given the importance of minerals to national security and economic prosperity. However, in the 1960s, the legislative branch became increasingly concerned about the impact of mining on human health and the environment. It successfully passed a series of laws to help address these issues, and the resulting regulations and judicial review from administering these laws still affect the permitting of new mines. In recent years, both Democratic and Republican presidents and bipartisan members of Congress have increasingly expressed the need to streamline permitting for new mine projects that are environmentally and socially responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These officials cite the necessity of new mines for not only national security and economic reasons but also environmental sustainability, including the adoption of new energy technologies. With the public interest of the government and the private interest of the mining industry generally supportive of streamlined mine permitting, both the incoming Trump administration and Congress could modernize the permitting process for new mines in the United States. As U.S. Geological Survey director George Otis Smith wrote in 1919, “Public interest and private interest in the long run are less antagonistic than either the captain of industry or the public servant has suspected.” Public and private interests now align on the importance of permitting new mines while simultaneously upholding high environmental and social standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Closing the midstream gap in the U.S. supply chain is crucial for safeguarding strategic interests and maintaining leadership in the global technologies that will shape the future.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical minerals have become essential to the technologies that power modern economies. While much attention is given to mining, it is the midstream stage—the processing and refining of these raw materials—that poses the greatest challenge for the United States. Processing these minerals into usable materials is a critical, yet often overlooked, part of the supply chain. It is essential to explore the key obstacles to developing strong midstream capabilities, examining the historical, economic, and geopolitical factors that have contributed to the current gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the United States has made progress in increasing its mining capacity, the country still struggles to efficiently process these critical minerals. Addressing this midstream bottleneck is essential for reducing dependence on foreign adversaries and building a more resilient supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-midstream-bottleneck&quot;&gt;THE MIDSTREAM BOTTLENECK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Strategic Blind Spot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. critical minerals supply chain is missing a key component: midstream processing and the conversion of raw minerals into advanced materials. This stage involves transforming mined ores into high-purity metals and producing materials tailored for specific end uses. Although the United States is a significant producer of minerals such as copper and rare earth elements (REEs), it is a net exporter of both because it lacks the infrastructure needed to process them domestically. In 2023, the United States produced more than 12 percent of the REEs mined globally but exported 93 percent of those materials. During the same period, the United States produced 5 percent of the world’s mined copper and exported 32 percent of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These important raw materials—whether mined or recycled—are considered critical to national defense and economic security, yet they are exported at high rates, often to China, where they are processed and converted into finished products. As a result, the United States finds itself exporting its raw materials only to buy them back in the form of advanced technologies like cell phones and electric vehicles. This reliance creates strategic risks that directly affect national security and economic autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without robust midstream processing capabilities, the United States is exposed to serious potential supply chain disruptions. Geopolitical tensions, export restrictions, or price manipulation could significantly impact the availability of critical materials. In recent years, China has implemented multiple export restrictions on critical minerals, particularly targeting raw materials such as gallium, germanium, and REEs, which are crucial for advanced technology manufacturing. In July 2023, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced export controls on gallium and germanium products, which took effect on August 1, 2023. These controls require companies to apply for special export licenses, effectively reducing global supply amid fears of a broader Chinese strategy aimed at countering Western semiconductor production capabilities. China has also shown a willingness to restrict other strategic resources, like REES, of which it refines 92 percent of the global supply. Beijing has imposed export restrictions on rare earth processing and magnet technologies, underscoring its readiness to use its near-monopoly position as leverage in ongoing trade disputes, particularly with the United States and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History shows that these disruptions are likely to occur at the least opportune times, whether due to a global pandemic, such as Covid-19, or international conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of domestic processing capability means that some of the most crucial U.S. technologies remain vulnerable to the influence of foreign adversaries. The fact that China holds dominant positions in processing for many essential minerals, including lithium (65 percent), cobalt (74 percent), copper (42 percent), and graphite (100 percent), makes this dependence especially concerning. As global demand for critical minerals rises, authoritarian regimes like those in China and Russia are exploiting the West’s hesitancy toward mining and refining, allowing them to nurture U.S. dependence in a deliberate effort to weaken Western technological leadership and economic influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closing the midstream gap in the U.S. supply chain is crucial for safeguarding strategic interests, reinforcing economic independence, and maintaining leadership in the global technologies that will shape the future. This challenge is not insurmountable, but it would be a mistake to underestimate the urgency or complexity of the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;processing-methods&quot;&gt;PROCESSING METHODS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoding the Complexities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midstream processing of minerals typically begins with physical beneficiation, where the ore is crushed and the valuable minerals are separated from waste rock through techniques like flotation or magnetic separation. However, many minerals require further refining to reach a pure, usable form. At this stage, two primary methods are used: pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pyrometallurgy involves the use of high temperatures to extract metals, especially from ores that are rich in sulfides, such as nickel, cobalt, and copper. In this process, the ore is heated in a furnace, triggering chemical reactions that separate the metal from other elements. While this technique is well established and effective for certain ores, it is energy intensive and produces harmful emissions. The significant energy and environmental costs associated with pyrometallurgy make it less appealing for widespread use, especially as industries seek cleaner, more sustainable processing methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hydrometallurgy, by contrast, uses chemicals to dissolve metals from ores, allowing them to be recovered from the solution. This method is often applied to oxide ores, such as those containing lithium or copper, as well as laterites, which are a key source of nickel and cobalt. Hydrometallurgy tends to be more energy efficient than pyrometallurgy and can have a lower environmental impact, provided the chemicals are managed responsibly. For example, different hydrometallurgical techniques are needed in lithium production depending on whether the lithium is extracted from spodumene ore (a solid rock) or brine (saltwater). Brine extraction traditionally involves evaporating water to concentrate the lithium, but newer technologies like direct lithium extraction (DLE) are being developed to speed up the process and reduce water usage, making it more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midstream processing of minerals often involves byproduct extraction, especially when dealing with minerals such as gallium or germanium, which are rarely found in high concentrations on their own. For example, gallium is primarily obtained as a byproduct of aluminum production from bauxite, while germanium is recovered from zinc ores. Extracting these byproducts involves hydrometallurgical processes that dissolve the primary metal-bearing minerals, from which trace elements can be separated. Gallium is extracted from the caustic liquor used in the Bayer process for refining bauxite into alumina, which contains only small parts per million of gallium. The gallium is precipitated through additional chemical treatments, making its production more complex and economically viable only when bauxite production volumes are high and market prices justify the added expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, germanium is typically recovered from zinc smelting residues using a combination of acid leaching and solvent extraction. As with gallium, this adds a layer of cost and complexity to the refining process, often making the economic feasibility dependent on favorable market conditions and the presence of sufficient germanium concentrations in the feedstock. Environmental factors also need to be considered, as byproduct extraction generates additional chemical waste and often involves heavy use of acids and solvents. Managing these waste streams safely is crucial, as improper handling can lead to significant environmental damage, including contamination of water resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge in refining critical minerals lies in the fact that each mineral, along with its specific ore type, requires a tailored processing approach. These processes vary in terms of cost, efficiency, and environmental impact, adding complexity to midstream operations. REEs, for instance, require intricate chemical processes, such as solvent extraction, to isolate individual elements. This process is particularly complex because REEs often occur together in nature and must be separated one by one. Therefore, businesses that maintain continuous, optimized operations—without frequent stops or interruptions—gain significant efficiency advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a sustainable and competitive midstream processing industry is especially challenging due to the unique characteristics of each mineral. Companies must not only advance technologies that make processing more efficient but also address the environmental consequences of these methods. Innovations like DLE for lithium and closed-loop systems that recycle chemicals and water show promise, but scaling these technologies to industrial levels remains a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the United States faces shortages of skilled labor and advanced equipment, as much of the processing infrastructure has moved overseas. The need for specialized knowledge in metallurgy, chemistry, and engineering further complicates efforts to scale midstream processing domestically. Developing these capabilities will require significant investment, innovation, and a strategic focus on workforce development and infrastructure expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-workforce-challenge&quot;&gt;The Workforce Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary challenges to expanding midstream processing capabilities in the United States is the shortage of skilled labor. Successfully processing critical minerals requires specialized expertise in fields such as metallurgy, chemistry, and engineering. Additionally, large-scale industrial operations demand experienced workers who can manage the complex processes involved in transforming raw materials into refined, usable products. Currently, the U.S. workforce is underprepared to meet these demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major factor contributing to this shortage is the decline in the number of mining and metallurgical engineers. According to a 2023 McKinsey report, the number of mining engineering graduates in the United States has dropped by 39 percent since 2016. Similar trends can be seen across other technical disciplines. At the same time, rapidly growing industries like battery manufacturing, semiconductors, and clean energy are attracting skilled workers with higher wages and better career opportunities. By comparison, critical minerals processing is a niche sector with fewer established players and a steeper learning curve, making it less appealing to prospective workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gap in expertise is not limited to technical positions; it also affects management and operational roles. In countries like China, government-backed investments and years of experience have fostered a self-sustaining industry, complete with a robust pipeline of skilled talent. The United States, by contrast, often must rely on foreign experts or make significant investments in retraining domestic workers. This process is time consuming and costly, creating another obstacle to scaling midstream operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a coordinated national strategy to develop the necessary workforce, the United States will continue to face difficulties in expanding its midstream processing capabilities. Addressing this challenge requires investment in education and training programs that focus specifically on the skills needed for critical minerals processing. These programs must also work to increase interest in the field among new graduates and career switchers. Without a concerted effort to build a skilled workforce, the United States will face ongoing barriers to creating a strong, competitive midstream sector capable of supporting its broader industrial and technological goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;navigating-feedstock-and-market-immaturity&quot;&gt;Navigating Feedstock and Market Immaturity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The availability of feedstock for processing is a critical challenge for the U.S. midstream sector. Mining delays due to local permitting or geopolitical instability abroad in key mining regions can disrupt the steady supply of raw materials necessary to keep processing facilities operational. While some critical minerals are sourced from stable partners like Australia and Canada, others come from regions with more complex geopolitical dynamics. For instance, most of the global supply of cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country known for political instability and humanitarian concerns. Meanwhile, the production of REEs is dominated by China, which raises additional concerns about supply chain reliability, given the geopolitical tensions between the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further challenge is the disparity between exchange-traded and non-exchange-traded minerals. Exchange-traded commodities, such as copper, nickel, and lithium, benefit from well-established markets with price transparency, liquidity, and hedging options. These features attract investors and create smoother market operations by allowing companies to manage risks more effectively. In contrast, non-exchange-traded minerals, like REEs and gallium, present far more opaque pricing, limited buyers, and unpredictable supply chains. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for businesses to forecast costs and plan investments, which further discourages the development of processing facilities for these minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of transparent and reliable markets makes it challenging for U.S. producers to attract private capital. Investors are hesitant to engage in industries where pricing and supply are unpredictable, leading to financing gaps that hinder the expansion of midstream infrastructure. This decentralized nature of the U.S. critical minerals market stands in sharp contrast to China’s vertically integrated model, where state-backed investments ensure a more stable supply chain from mining through refining. In China, government support for mining and processing creates a cohesive market ecosystem that offers stability to investors and businesses alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States to build a viable midstream sector, policy support will be essential in improving the transparency and maturity of domestic markets for critical minerals. This could include measures such as those described below to increase price transparency, encourage the establishment of standardized markets for non-exchange-traded minerals, and provide incentives that make investment in these areas more attractive. Without these steps, U.S. efforts to establish a robust midstream processing capability will continue to face significant barriers due to market uncertainties and the unpredictability of feedstock availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-levers&quot;&gt;POLICY LEVERS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How the United States Can Close the Gap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tackle the challenges of developing midstream processing capabilities for critical minerals in the United States, a multifaceted strategy is required—one that integrates government policy with private sector innovation. Several key policy actions can help accelerate progress in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support workforce development.&lt;/strong&gt; Establishing a National Critical Minerals Workforce Initiative will address workforce challenges in domestic projects by leveraging federal programs and tax incentives. The Department of Labor should prioritize critical minerals in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) to support education in metallurgy, chemistry, and mining engineering. Community colleges can partner with WIOA boards to create certifications and degrees, while regional training centers can integrate into the American Job Centers network, enhanced by the National Science Foundation’s Advanced Technological Education program.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act can also support high school programs in critical minerals, building a talent pipeline. Funding for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) clubs and science fairs can promote interest, and collaboration with the Department of Energy’s Minority Educational Institution Student Partnership Program can encourage underrepresented groups.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Expanding scholarships and loan forgiveness programs will attract talent. The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program can offer scholarships for mining and chemical engineering, while a loan forgiveness program can support graduates in the critical minerals sector, with coordination from the Department of Defense to create a fund under the department’s Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish the U.S. Critical Minerals Reserve.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should establish a U.S. Critical Minerals Reserve to ensure a stable and secure supply of essential raw materials needed for midstream processing, thereby strengthening national security and economic resiliency. This reserve would function as a financial and strategic mechanism to mitigate supply disruptions caused by geopolitical risks, market volatility, and timing misalignments that occur due to the noncontiguous ramp of mining, processing, downstream production, and supply and demand. This approach aligns with the recommendations from the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, which emphasized reducing U.S. dependence on foreign-controlled supply chains for critical minerals, especially those dominated by China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The mechanism by which the reserve would work is straightforward. By lending capital to authorized market makers (AMMs), who will then procure specified critical minerals from allowed jurisdictions, the reserve would support domestic and allied supply chains, stabilize mineral prices, and mitigate risks associated with foreign-controlled resources. The AMMs, backed by private capital to achieve profit, would seek to reduce production costs through innovation while supporting downstream efforts to grow demand. The AMMs would take price risk, backed by federal loans, shifting that risk away from U.S. critical minerals producers. Consequently, the industry would gain resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update permitting to reduce delays and preserve safeguards.&lt;/strong&gt; To facilitate the development of critical minerals projects, it is important for the U.S. federal government to prioritize efforts to update the permitting process for mining and midstream operations. In order to minimize bureaucratic delays while preserving essential environmental safeguards, enhanced coordination between different federal, state, and local agencies will be required. In doing so, a more efficient pathway for obtaining permits can be established, which is crucial for ensuring a stable and competitive supply of critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A central component of this approach involves building on the existing Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC) to create a centralized “one-stop shop” specifically for critical minerals projects. Presently, navigating the permitting landscape requires companies to interact with multiple regulatory bodies, often leading to redundancies and significant delays. By leveraging the framework of FPISC, a more cohesive system can be put in place—one that aligns regulatory agencies at all levels and reduces inefficiencies. In 2021, mining was added to FPISC’s list of covered projects nder the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41). Expanding the FAST-41 program to include critical minerals projects explicitly would be instrumental in ensuring dedicated personnel are available to manage these projects, providing necessary technical assistance and promoting transparency in the permitting process.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another key strategy is to increase the use of programmatic environmental reviews and categorical exclusions to expedite the permitting process for critical minerals projects at the federal level. Programmatic environmental impact statements can be developed to evaluate the impacts of broad categories of activities associated with critical minerals in advance rather than requiring repetitive, project-by-project reviews. By covering common types of critical minerals activities—such as mineral exploration, drilling, processing, and material manufacturing—these programmatic reviews can establish baseline analyses. This proactive approach streamlines approvals by allowing subsequent individual assessments to focus on specific site conditions and deviations rather than reanalyzing general impacts that have already been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An interagency task force led by the Department of the Interior and including the Environmental Protection Agency, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the U.S. Forest Service could provide the structure needed to improve the permitting process. This task force would prioritize developing clear timelines for permit applications, allocating resources to support permit reviews, and offering guidance to companies seeking permits. Additionally, increased funding for the BLM and U.S. Geological Survey will be important so that these agencies can hire specialized personnel devoted exclusively to critical minerals projects, with the goal of reducing approval times without compromising the integrity of environmental assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Amending the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act to mandate the expedited consideration of critical minerals projects, particularly those with implications for midstream processing, could serve as a platform for enacting legislation related to critical minerals permitting. By adopting a model similar to the Renewable Energy Coordination Offices within the BLM, a specialized expedited permitting pathway could be established for critical minerals, ensuring that these projects receive appropriate priority.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;By creating a streamlined pathway and prioritizing projects of strategic importance, the United States can foster a resilient and competitive critical minerals sector that is better positioned to meet current and future demand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-8&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Path Forward for U.S. Midstream Leadership&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close the midstream gap, the United States must pursue a coordinated strategy that combines policy support, private investment, technological innovation, and workforce development. As the global race for critical minerals intensifies, the United States cannot afford to fall behind in building a robust processing and refining capability. Without it, the country risks not only lagging in technological advancements but also compromising its energy security and economic independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path forward to establishing a competitive critical minerals midstream in the United States will be challenging. Labor shortages, the need for market maturation, and reliance on foreign suppliers all present significant hurdles. However, the opportunities for U.S. leadership are equally significant. By fostering innovation, investing in skilled talent, and building resilient, transparent supply chains, the United States can strengthen its position as a global leader in critical minerals. This effort is essential for securing a stable foundation for the future of technology, and by acting decisively now, the United States can ensure long-term competitiveness in the global market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;gracelin-baskaran-1&quot;&gt;Gracelin Baskaran&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States cannot, and should not, remain on the sidelines when it comes to minerals. But its entry into the international field will have to come with a model that competes on economics and practices.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 30 years, China has emerged as a critical player in the mineral supply chains crucial for national and energy security. Although it produces only 10 percent of the world’s lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper, China imports sufficient quantities to process 65 to 90 percent of the global supply of these metals. This dominance is the result of years of industrial planning and foreign policy initiatives from Beijing. For the United States, China’s dominance poses a strategic challenge, especially given rising geopolitical tensions and Chinese export restrictions on critical commodities, including gallium and germanium, which are vital for semiconductors; graphite, which is key for electric vehicles; and antimony, which is used in many defense technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the United States has limited domestic reserves—including less than 1 percent of the world’s reserves of commodities such as cobalt, nickel, and graphite—it must develop a strategy to reduce its dependence and enhance its mineral supply security. The good news is that many resource-rich countries want to work with the United States and its partners to develop mineral resources if they can bring tangible benefits to host jurisdictions. Resource-rich countries want to diversify partners because they have realized that relying on a single country for investment and offtake is a risk. Additionally, Western companies are generally more responsible, environmentally conscious, and attentive to human rights and labor conditions, which can reduce the friction between communities, workers, firms, and the government. The bad news is that the U.S. government cannot command the efforts of mining companies, which are private companies accountable to shareholders. Instead, the United States must create an environment that will enable the private sector to compete with state-owned enterprises and offer more benefits to resource-rich countries. The result should be a new model of mining that is mutually beneficial for companies, resource holders, and U.S. consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Trump and Biden administrations set out to improve supply through better exploration, production, recycling, and reprocessing of critical minerals. However, the United States’ efforts to secure its supply chain have been reactive and unsystematic, especially in international exploration and mining. U.S. officials often learn about projects after they have been announced, missing out on the chance to coordinate investments with Western partners. In particular, the United States will need to engage in Africa, Latin America, and other resource-rich regions in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the world’s most resource-rich countries are among the most difficult in which to do business. U.S. government efforts can enable investment by helping reduce risks for projects and operators. The solutions, however, are not one-size-fits-all. A framework for prioritizing countries is a key starting point—and then identifying how tools can be deployed in these jurisdictions can follow. Approaches can include government-to-government cooperation agreements, technical assistance on legal and regulatory reforms, public-private partnerships, and concessional financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also be important to overcome the historical legacy of mining, wherein communities and workers bore many of the consequences of resource extraction, including environmental damage, human displacement, and poor economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States cannot, and should not, remain on the sidelines when it comes to minerals. But its entry into the field will have to come with a model that competes on economics and practices. With a more systemic approach, the United States can enable its diplomats, policymakers, and private sector actors to source the minerals needed to process and manufacture goods that are required for the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has limited resources—and developing a targeted strategy for engagement will require identifying priority jurisdictions and developing appropriate tools to advance U.S. interests. Given the ever-changing landscape of electoral outcomes, policy changes, and geological discoveries, this chapter establishes criteria for identifying priority jurisdictions—drawn from ample global experience—and makes policy recommendations on how the United States can use financial and nonfinancial tools to advance its goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-framework-for-identifying-priority-jurisdictions-for-government-cooperation&quot;&gt;A FRAMEWORK FOR IDENTIFYING PRIORITY JURISDICTIONS FOR GOVERNMENT COOPERATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, the United States has primarily engaged with emerging markets through aid and national security initiatives. In 2007, the United States established the Africa Command to address security challenges, with the U.S. military spending nearly $2 billion annually on its operations in Africa. On the aid front, in 2023, U.S. government aid to emerging economies totaled $223.7 billion, of which $53.5 billion was allocated to Africa. Latin America received considerably less—approximately $2.5 billion was requested by the Biden administration for Latin America and the Caribbean in the same year, to be disbursed through the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the United States has done little to engage with these countries from a commercial perspective, particularly in the mining sector. Recent efforts include the Lobito Corridor under the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, a $150 million loan for a graphite project in Mozambique, and backing through the Minerals Security Partnership for the Serra Verde rare earth elements project in Brazil. However, these investments have not followed a cohesive strategy and generally occur in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are five broad considerations that determine a high-potential mining jurisdiction: (1) geology—mineral reserves and quality; (2) policy stability, transparency, and rule of law; (3) quality of infrastructure; (4) the ability to secure and maintain a social license to operate; and (5) historical trade relations and market access. This section draws on examples from across the world to unpack these considerations. However, none of these factors can be taken in isolation; prioritization should be based on their aggregate impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quantity-and-quality-of-mineral-reserves&quot;&gt;Quantity and Quality of Mineral Reserves&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strategy must align priority minerals with available resources, taking into consideration recent discoveries, ore grade, and the size of identified deposits. Indonesia serves as an excellent example of a jurisdiction prioritized by investors and policymakers despite its challenging policy environment, driven by rising resource nationalism. Not only does Indonesia have a fifth of the world’s nickel, but it also has some of the highest-quality and most profitable reserves, as is evident through metrics like recovery rate and mill-head grade. (Recovery rate refers to the proportion of nickel successfully extracted from raw ore, while the mill-head grade indicates the average nickel concentration in mined ore processed through a mill.) Among the world’s five largest nickel mines—Kola Division in Russia, Jinchuan in China, Sudbury Operations in Canada, Sorowako in Indonesia, and Polar Division in Russia—Sorowako stands out with the highest recovery rate (88 percent, compared to 25.4–85 percent for the other four mines) and the second-highest mill-head grade (1.68 percent), surpassed only by Russia’s Kola operation (2.3 percent). Indonesia’s dominance in nickel production played a significant role in U.S. president Joe Biden and Indonesia’s then-president Joko Widodo’s decision to elevate their countries’ bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2023, despite Indonesia’s poor environmental track record in nickel production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-stability-transparency-and-rule-of-law&quot;&gt;Policy Stability, Transparency, and Rule of Law&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining investments are long term, so confidence in the stability of the government and its policies; institutional capabilities to enforce mineral legislation, regulations, and standards; and transparency are all important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite possessing some of the world’s richest copper deposits—boasting ore grades exceeding 3 percent, substantially higher than the global average of 0.6–0.8 percent—and holding half the world’s cobalt reserves, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) struggles to attract Western mining companies due to political instability, corruption, and weak enforcement of laws. At present, Glencore and Ivanhoe are among the only Westerns firms operating in the DRC. Both First Quantum Minerals, a Canadian company, and Freeport-McMoRan, a U.S. company, have exited since 2010. First Quantum Minerals’ departure from the DRC resulted from a conflict with the government over the expropriation of one the company’s major assets. During a visit to the DRC in August 2024, both industry and government officials agreed that corruption is a significant deterrent to attracting Western investment. Without a central tax authority, any government entity can impose a tax and freeze a company’s assets until it is paid. So, despite having some of the best copper deposits in the world—both in size and quality—and half the world’s cobalt, investors remain hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy stability is a key consideration. As demand for minerals rapidly rises, an increasing number of governments are adopting resource nationalism policies to secure a larger share of benefits from their natural resources. These policies may include higher taxes and royalties, nationalization or state ownership, export control (such as nonautomatic licensing, quotas, tariffs, or bans), and local ownership requirements. In recent years, countries have leveraged bans on raw resource exports to mandate local processing and value addition. However, such policies often elicit mixed reactions from investors. New investors may hesitate to enter, while existing investors must decide whether to comply or divest. Countries that adopt resource nationalism policies on short notice risk signaling policy volatility, which can deter investment. Greenfield investment is drying up in jurisdictions with resource nationalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quality-of-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Quality of Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining and processing require critical infrastructure, including energy, water, ports, rail, and roads. Mining is one of the most energy-intensive industries in the world, accounting for 10 percent of global energy consumption. Estimates suggest that the mining industry’s energy consumption could grow by a factor of two to eight by 2060.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affordable and stable base load power can make mining and processing investments significantly more commercially attractive. Saudi Arabia has made substantial investments in renewable energy and boasts some of the lowest energy costs in the world. Its Al Ghat wind project set a record for the lowest electricity cost from wind power—just 1.56558 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) levelized cost of energy (LCOE). Saudi Arabia’s Wa’ad Alshamal project has the second-lowest cost, at 1.70187 cents/kWh LCOE. Additionally, Saudia Arabia has the lowest LCOE for solar photovoltaics. These developments have positioned Saudi Arabia to become one of the world’s largest mineral processing hubs. By 2030, the kingdom aims to be one of the seven biggest mineral processors in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries with energy shortages are at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting mineral extraction and processing investments. Some of the most mineral-rich countries are among the most energy-poor—and they are overwhelmingly in Africa. In 2022, only 21.5 percent of the population in the DRC had access to energy, compared to 33.2 percent in Mozambique, 36.1 percent in Madagascar, and 45.8 percent in Tanzania. While some companies have opted to build their own energy generation and transmission infrastructure, this adds a significant cost to doing business. In South America, the global mining company Anglo American has made significant energy investments and operates entirely on renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transportation infrastructure is vital for global mineral supply chains. Commodities must move within countries and across borders and oceans. Among the world’s 10 largest ports by volume of goods moved, 7 are in China. Of the 50 largest ports, 2 are in Latin America (Santos, Brazil; and Colon, Panama), and one is in Africa (Tanger Med, Morocco). These ports serve as critical hubs facilitating the global trade of minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rail is the most efficient way to transport minerals to ports, as the bulk nature of commodities can be damaging to roads. Transporting bulk commodities by rail also generates 75 percent fewer carbon emissions compared to road journeys. Africa’s landmass is larger than the combined areas of the continental United States, China, Europe, and India—yet its 82,000 kilometers of rail is only slightly more than the combined rail networks of France and Germany. Much of Africa’s rail infrastructure has been poorly maintained, with nearly a fifth entirely nonoperational. As a result, most commodities are transported by road. However, roads also present significant challenges. Africa has one of the lowest road densities in the world, with just 27 kilometers of road per 10,000 people, and less than a third of its roads are paved. This lack of infrastructure underscores the rationale behind the Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment’s Lobito Corridor, which aims to connect the DRC, Zambia, and the rest of Angola to Angola’s Port of Lobito, thereby reducing transportation costs for mineral exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;securing-social-licenses-to-operate&quot;&gt;Securing Social Licenses to Operate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social license to operate is a concept used to describe the informal and ongoing approval of a mining company’s operations by the surrounding community and stakeholders. Unlike legal permits issued by governments, social licenses are granted by communities and based on trust, legitimacy, and consent. Social license to operate is one of the biggest risks facing mining companies. For three consecutive years—2019, 2020, and 2021—it topped the list of the 10 biggest risks cited by the mining industry in Ernst &amp;amp; Young’s annual survey. Half of the mining executives surveyed identified it as the biggest risk. Looking ahead, executives still rank it among the top five risks facing the industry in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peru is a prime example of the impact of social license to operate on investment. It is one of the only Latin American countries to have seen a decline in investment in recent years. Over the last five years, from 2019 to 2024, exploration investment increased by 21.6 percent in Chile, 26.9 percent in Mexico, 51.7 percent in Brazil, and 105.4 percent Argentina. The only major mining jurisdiction that saw a reduction in exploration investment was Peru, which declined by 12.6 percent. During this time, there has been a substantial increase in social unrest related to mining in Peru. In August 2023 alone, there were 71 mining-related protests. Fitch Ratings, a major credit rating agency, cited mining-related social unrest, protests, and blockades as a significant challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panama is increasingly viewed as “uninvestable” after social unrest and subsequent government action led to the closure of its biggest mine. First Quantum Minerals’ $10 billion Cobre Panama copper mine was one of the world’s largest copper-producing mines, accounting for 1.5 percent of global copper supply. Since beginning production in 2019, it had accounted for 75 percent of Panama’s exports and 5 percent of its gross domestic product. However, a storm was brewing. In addition to high unemployment and corruption there was also growing resentment over the mine’s environmental impact—particularly river and soil contamination. There was also sentiment that the mine should be in the hands of the Panamanian people rather than foreign companies. Illegal blockades of the international port and mine access road forced the mine to stop production in November 2023. These were the country’s worst protests in decades. At the end of November 2023, the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that First Quantum Minerals’ mining concession contract was unconstitutional. It is hard to see an outcome in which mining companies would want to undertake new projects in Panama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-trade-relations-and-market-access&quot;&gt;Historical Trade Relations and Market Access&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market access—or a company’s ability to sell goods and services across borders—is a critical determinant of a company’s investment decisions. Market access involves the conditions, barriers, and regulations that impact trade, such as tariffs, quotas, technical standards, and trade agreements. A strong history of bilateral trade—built on stable market access—can make mining investments more commercially attractive to investors. Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom are among the United States’ biggest trading partners. With the exception of China, which has imposed a barrage of export restrictions, there is little concern that future investments in these countries are at risk. Historical trade ties are a strong signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Namibia is a prime example of a country with which the United States has strong trade ties—and significant room to increase mineral trade. Namibia is a key beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a U.S. unilateral trade preference program signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 2000 and renewed in 2015. Importantly, Namibia has key critical minerals vital to safeguarding U.S. security interests. Its Lofdal heavy rare earths operation produces 2,000 tons per year of rare earth oxides and has rich deposits of two of the most valuable heavy rare earth metals, which are used in defense systems, lasers, electronics, and renewable energy technologies. Namibia also has the third-largest uranium reserves in the world—a vital input for nuclear power—and has large copper, cobalt, lithium, zinc, and fluorspar reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leveraging-the-framework-for-minerals-diplomacy&quot;&gt;LEVERAGING THE FRAMEWORK FOR MINERALS DIPLOMACY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When determining which countries the United States should prioritize, none of the considerations discussed above should be taken in isolation. If geology alone were enough, policymakers and investors would focus on mining nickel in Australia, whose total reserves match those of Indonesia. Unfortunately, higher production costs have rendered Australian nickel uncompetitive. Over the last two years, BHP closed its Nickel West operations and West Musgrave project in Australia, and Glencore shut down its Koniambo Nickel SAS operation in New Caledonia due to unprofitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If historical trade ties were enough, the United States would have much stronger minerals trade with Latin America. The United States has more free trade agreements with Latin American countries than with any other region in the world. These include agreements with Chile, Mexico, and Peru. Yet, in 2021, Chile exported $28.2 billion worth of copper to China, compared to just $6.5 billion to the United States. Similarly, Mexico, one of the United States’ biggest trade partners, sent 94 percent of its copper exports to China, compared to just 1 percent to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If resource nationalism were the sole determining factor, Vale Base Metals would cease mining nickel in Indonesia, and Freeport-McMoRan would not still have its copper operations there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If social license to operate were the determining factor, First Quantum Minerals would not be focusing its efforts on restoring operations at its Cobre Panama mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If infrastructure was the primary determinant, investors would not be flocking to Zambia. The country is experiencing a 500 megawatt (MW) energy deficit due to a drought that is undermining hydroelectric power generation and causing rolling blackouts. The country also has significantly higher transportation costs because it is landlocked. Transportation costs add 40 percent to production expenses because accessing ports such as Beira, Dar es Salaam, Durban, Lobito, and Walvis Bay is difficult and time consuming. Nonetheless, First Quantum Minerals announced a $1.3 billion investment to expand copper production; Anglo American has returned to Zambia after two decades; Rio Tinto is pursuing an exploration campaign; KoBold, a U.S. firm, is building Zambia’s biggest copper mine; IHC has acquired a major asset; and Barrick Gold has scaled up exploration with plans to create a super-pit at its existing mine, potentially extending its life by 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the aggregation of these considerations that determines what constitutes a high-potential mining jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 evaluates the performance of selected countries, chosen because they are home to multiple priority resources. The table applies the considerations framework to these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada, Australia, and Saudi Arabia are high-income countries with which the United States should pursue collaboration, including providing financing and leveraging subsidies and tax credits, as outlined in the table above. When it comes to emerging markets, Namibia should be a priority jurisdiction. With some infrastructure support, Tanzania and Zambia’s attractiveness could increase substantially, making them important sources of nickel, graphite, and rare earth elements. Argentina, Brazil, and Chile would benefit from building capacity for firms to strengthen their social license to operate through more active benefit sharing with communities. It is no surprise that there is an aversion among Western investors to enter the DRC and even South Africa, or that Peru is one of the only Latin American countries to have experienced a decline in investment over the last five years. Addressing these factors can improve the attractiveness of these jurisdictions to mining companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-building-minerals-diplomacy&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BUILDING MINERALS DIPLOMACY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a range of tools it can better deploy to strengthen minerals diplomacy. While discussions often center on concessional financing, the United States’ arsenal is significantly larger. If used strategically, these tools can enhance U.S. supply security and redesign supply chains, enabling countries that have historically exported resources to China to shift their exports to the United States and other Western nations. These instruments can be broadly categorized into four areas: financing, geological mapping, infrastructure, and market incentives. This section offers recommendations for each of these four areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reform the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation.&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) was not originally established to finance minerals security needs. However, it has become the primary vehicle for funding such projects overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Two amendments could significantly enhance the DFC’s capacity to support minerals security interests. First, the White House’s Office of Management and Budget should amend its rules to allow the DFC to make equity investments in mining projects. Equity investments send a strong signal to both companies and countries, as government equity can help mobilize additional private capital and foster government-to-government cooperation. Second, revising or introducing legislation to enable the DFC to finance mining projects in high-income, resource-rich countries is essential. Under current rules, the DFC cannot fund projects in countries such as Canada and Chile. Congress could address this issue similarly to its approach with the European Energy Security and Diversification Act of 2019. That legislation authorized the DFC to finance energy projects in high-income European countries, including a $500 million loan guarantee for a liquified natural gas project in Poland aimed at reducing reliance on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support infrastructure development in priority jurisdictions.&lt;/strong&gt; One way China has advanced its minerals security goals is through infrastructure development. This approach benefits host jurisdictions while ensuring that mining operations have access to essential energy, water, and transportation infrastructure. Such investments are vital for sustaining the mining ecosystem. During the first 10 years of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), it invested $1 trillion, including $634 billion in construction contracts and $419 billion in nonfinancial investments. In 2023 alone, China allocated $7.9 billion to energy investments. That same year, it made BRI investments in 61 countries in 2023, with Africa overtaking the Middle East as the largest recipient. These investments have allowed China to secure raw materials from domestic processing. For example, in 2018, Chile became one of the first Latin American countries to join the BRI, and today, nearly one-third of China’s raw copper comes from Chile.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States has several mechanisms for financing infrastructure abroad, including the DFC and Power Africa. Power Africa, launched by President Barack Obama in 2013, was an innovative, government-led partnership aimed at increasing energy access in Africa. Initially, it set out to add 10,000 MW of energy capacity and 20 million connections by 2030. In 2014, Power Africa tripled its goals. However, over time, budgetary appropriations have significantly declined, hampering its ability to operate at the required scale.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To deploy soft power effectively, strengthen minerals diplomacy, and reduce barriers to entry for Western mining companies, mechanisms like the DFC and Power Africa will require substantially larger budget allocations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage the U.S. Geological Survey to undertake geological mapping and de-risk exploration in priority jurisdictions.&lt;/strong&gt; Many developing countries remain either unmapped or reliant on outdated geological surveys. For example, 45 percent of Zambia’s land is still geologically unmapped, and the remaining 55 percent was last mapped before 1998. Geological mapping can help de-risk investments for exploration companies, which is crucial given that over 99 percent of exploration projects are unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Building mapping capabilities will require budgetary allocations. Additionally, embedding U.S. Geological Survey attachés at embassies to oversee mapping efforts presents an important opportunity for advancing minerals diplomacy. These attachés could collaborate with geological surveys and mining ministries in host jurisdictions, fostering stronger partnerships and supporting informed resource development strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop carrots—subsidies and tax credits—to incentivize investment in priority jurisdictions globally.&lt;/strong&gt; The lack of U.S. investment incentives has allowed China to gain control over many of Africa’s natural resources. China’s foreign direct investment in Africa grew from $75 million in 2003 to $4.2 billion in 2020, primarily in the mining sector. Similarly, China has made substantial investments in Latin America, focusing on critical minerals, energy, telecommunications, and transport infrastructure. In November 2024, Chinese president Xi Jinping visited Peru, where he launched the first phrase of a $3.5 billion port project aimed at strengthening trade routes from Latin America’s Pacific coast to China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the value of trade between China and Africa increased from $10 billion in 2000 to $25 billion in 2021—over four times the growth seen between the United States and Africa. In Latin America, Chinese trade has soared from $12 billion in 2000 to $450 billion in 2023. Investment incentives and de-risking measures—such as subsidies, tax credits, and loan guarantees—will be critical for countering Chinese investment and fostering U.S. engagement in these strategic regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-9&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While an “America First” approach and developing domestic mining are important, continuing to lag in emerging markets presents a critical vulnerability for the United States for two reasons. First, the United States lacks sufficient quantities and quality of many commodities essential for national, economic, and energy security. Second, allowing China to continue to outpace the United States in Latin America, Africa, and Asia only strengthens China’s dominance in global mineral supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the United States cannot pursue efforts in every resource-rich country. Prioritizing target countries for minerals diplomacy will be crucial. This chapter proposed a framework for identifying these countries based on five considerations: (1) mineral reserves and quality; (2) policy stability, transparency, and rule of law; (3) quality of infrastructure; (4) the ability to secure and maintain a social license to operate; and (5) historical trade relations and market access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the United States must move beyond discussions about what it should do—action on financing instruments, infrastructure and mapping, and incentives is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mining-the-deep-sea&quot;&gt;Mining the Deep Sea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A New Minerals Frontier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;seaver-wang&quot;&gt;Seaver Wang&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s multi-sector deep sea mining industry efforts, which enjoy clear national policy backing, stand in stark contrast with the United States’ nonexistent seafloor minerals strategy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming years, scientific, technological, and regulatory trends appear likely to unlock the economically viable and environmentally responsible collection of metals-rich nodules from the abyssal seafloor at depths of several kilometers. Yet despite the potential of seafloor polymetallic nodules to dramatically alter existing critical minerals supply chains, the United States has neglected to develop policies that can help realize the potential of this emerging sector and deliver strategic national benefits. At present, U.S. passivity increases the likelihood that new production from seafloor metals will simply flow to Chinese metallurgical processing plants, exacerbating current patterns of critical minerals import dependence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A robust U.S. critical minerals strategy should immediately break from this trend of inaction and take steps to leverage nodule resources as a new, diversified source of metals to support energy transition efforts. In the near term, given its nonparticipation in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the United States cannot directly access minerals within the international seabed area. Policymakers should therefore take a multi-pronged approach, aligning diplomatic efforts, existing Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives, and policy support for downstream industries to attract nodules extracted from overseas to domestic mineral-processing and battery-manufacturing plants. Eventually, the United States should become a party to UNCLOS, gaining equal access to minerals from the international seabed and helping influence and strengthen international governance of the high seas. Public support for research on the seabed, deep sea technologies, and environmental best practices can also better position the country to compete in this emerging sector. Meanwhile, improved federal mapping of offshore mineral resources in territorial and extended continental shelf waters may identify promising mineral deposits for development under U.S. sovereign authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-new-mineral-frontier&quot;&gt;THE NEW MINERAL FRONTIER&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each passing year, viable commercial mineral harvesting from the seafloor becomes increasingly realistic. Historical barriers to deep sea mining are diminishing in the face of better resource mapping, improving robotics, and falling cost propositions relative to land-based resources. Spurred by growing demand for minerals for clean energy, regulatory developments for resource collection on the international seafloor are proceeding slowly but steadily. Countries are also increasingly pursuing seafloor mineral resources in their exclusive economic zones (EEZs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the Norwegian government moved to allow exploratory resource-mapping and equipment-testing activities on its offshore continental shelf. Japan has tested the viability of several different kinds of seafloor mineral deposits in its EEZ in past years, most recently discovering a significant concentration of metals-rich nodules in the country’s easternmost sovereign waters in July 2023. In August 2024, India opened up its EEZ for exploration contracts. In the South Pacific, the Cook Islands expects to make key regulatory decisions on seafloor nodule collection within years. Meanwhile, in December 2023, the United States took a key first step toward securing seafloor resources by declaring boundaries for the U.S. extended continental shelf (ECS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under UNCLOS, seabed minerals and extractive activities beyond the boundaries of countries’ sovereign rights fall under the regulatory authority of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), an independent international organization. However, opposition from lawmakers hostile to international seafloor governance has blocked the U.S. Senate from ratifying UNCLOS for over 30 years, leaving the United States one of the few countries not party to UNCLOS and the ISA. Without full membership, it cannot sponsor mineral-related activities on the international seabed. At the same time, the federal government has devoted little policy attention to pursuing hardrock minerals in sovereign waters. Thus, despite seafloor metals’ value as an alternative to import dependence on critical minerals from China, the United States still lacks any meaningful policy strategy for ocean minerals. Without decisive federal action, seabed minerals may simply become the newest entry on a long list of strategic commodities firmly under Chinese state and industry control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three different types of mineral-rich seafloor deposits have historically attracted the most attention for excavation: polymetallic nodules (also called manganese nodules), ferromanganese crusts (also called cobalt crusts), and polymetallic sulfide deposits (also called seafloor massive sulfides). No commercial exploitation of these seafloor minerals is taking place today, although exploration efforts (i.e., resource mapping and equipment testing) have increased in recent years. Some polymetallic nodule and ferromanganese crust resources likely lie in seafloor areas under U.S. jurisdiction, particularly in the Pacific, but these and other deposits in U.S. EEZ waters remain incompletely characterized. Globally, seabed mineral exploration to date has mostly targeted the international seafloor, particularly rich nodule fields in the central and western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferromanganese crusts and polymetallic sulfide deposits are tightly embedded into seafloor rock and sediment, making extraction difficult, environmentally challenging, and reliant on excavation techniques akin to those used for surface mining on land. Exploratory testing of systems to mine them remains relatively immature and may prove difficult to balance cost effectively with good environmental management. Because environmentally responsible and economically viable harvesting of ferromanganese crust and polymetallic sulfide resources is likely beyond reach for the foreseeable future, focusing policy efforts on such deposits seems relatively unproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, polymetallic nodules are potato-sized nuggets of metallic minerals that sit clustered atop sediment-covered, plains-like regions of the abyssal seafloor, typically at depths of 3.5–6 kilometers (2.2–3.7 miles). These nodules possess rich manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt content. Collection requires little more than a means of lifting them to the ocean’s surface. Most collector system concepts involve using robotic underwater vehicles that separate nodules from sediment using hydraulic jets, then transporting these nodules via pipe to a ship on the surface using hydraulic or mechanical lifting systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of nodule resources and relative simplicity of their collection have made nodules the focus of most exploration efforts. Of the 31 exploration contracts in international waters granted by the ISA, 19 target nodules while only 7 and 5 target polymetallic sulfide deposits and ferromanganese crusts, respectively. Moreover, technology for harvesting nodules is approaching commercial readiness, with several Western operators having successfully tested collector vehicle systems. Chinese state-owned companies, benefiting from coordinated support from industry partners, academic researchers, and national policy, intend to test similar technologies in international waters in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given current momentum, it seems likely that seafloor nodule collection will proceed with or without the United States. How soon this new frontier of metal resources manifests depends on many factors: technological performance and costs, the speed at which regulatory frameworks develop, government policy and scientific support, and the scope of demand induced by commodity markets. In any event, the United States should take proactive steps to leverage deep sea nodule resources. A fresh, ambitious policy approach could establish U.S. leadership in a strategic emerging technology sector and strengthen the national critical minerals supply picture in a single stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-seafloor-nodules-matter-to-the-united-states&quot;&gt;WHY DO SEAFLOOR NODULES MATTER TO THE UNITED STATES?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCZ) contains the largest polymetallic nodule field in the world, with 21 billion dry metric tons (23 million tons) of nodules. With a typical mass composition of 31 percent manganese, 1.4 percent nickel, 1.2 percent copper, and 0.2 percent cobalt, the CCZ may hold 6 billion metric tons (6.6 tons) of manganese, 270 million metric tons (300 tons) of nickel, 230 million metric tons (250 tons) of copper, and 50 million metric tons (55 tons) of cobalt. The CCZ alone thus exceeds known land-based cobalt and manganese resources—not reserves—by a factor of two, while holding nickel equivalent to over half of terrestrial resources. This quantity of minerals can produce up to 6.9 billion electric vehicle (EV) battery packs, more than enough to support the global transition to EVs a few times over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seafloor nodules thus offer a tantalizing opportunity to help the United States diversify four critical minerals supply chains at once while supporting domestic EV manufacturing. Chinese industry players currently dominate the value chain for cobalt, nickel, copper, and manganese. Around 70 percent of all global cobalt and nickel processing capacity operates in China, as does 44 percent of global copper refining. Consequently, Chinese firms perform over 75 percent of global manufacturing of nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cathode materials for EV batteries. This poses substantial challenges to U.S. automakers seeking to meet domestic-sourcing criteria for the critical minerals mined and processed for use in batteries. Manganese nodules could overturn this calculus, playing to U.S. strengths in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and oceanographic science while significantly expanding the country’s access to manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt. Conversely, failure to capitalize on the seafloor nodule opportunity may funnel collected minerals to ascendant Chinese battery technology firms, further cementing their supply chain dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, recent economic assessments suggest nodule operations can produce minerals at attractively low prices relative to conventional mining. Seafloor nodules could consequently support low-cost battery mineral feedstocks, increasing the economic competitiveness of downstream processing and battery manufacturing and helping reduce the costs of transitioning to clean energy and transportation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some challenge whether United States should consider harvesting seabed minerals at all, citing environmental concerns. Nodule collector vehicles will likely disturb the upper 5–15 centimeters (2–6 inches) of seafloor sediment and create a localized sediment cloud while introducing noise and light, disrupting organisms living on or around the nodules. But considering the higher and harder-to-manage environmental impacts of conventional mining on land, policies focused on nodules actually offer the United States an opportunity to help reduce the long-term environmental impact of global mineral supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seafloor nodule operations inherently allow for reduced environmental impacts, continuous improvement in impacts management, and strong enforcement of regulations. First, coproduction of four critical minerals from a single seafloor nodule area yields environmental benefits by obviating the need for multiple different mining projects on land. In contrast to land-based mining where operators must clear and excavate a sizeable area of the targeted landscape before extracting a single ton of ore, impacts from robotic collection are incremental, allowing for ongoing improvements that reduce the footprint of subsequent operations. The technology for nodule harvesting is still young, and successive generations of equipment may achieve better environmental protection—by selectively harvesting nodules with AI assistance, for instance, or by muffling underwater noise from the pipe system lifting nodules to the surface vessel. Ship-based operations, which operate far from human settlements, also offer advantages for regulators seeking to monitor or audit nodule collection activities. Overall, a holistic comparison of seafloor nodules relative to land-based minerals arguably increases the value of nodule resources from a policy perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-current-international-state-of-play&quot;&gt;THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL STATE OF PLAY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop an effective U.S. strategy for polymetallic nodules, policymakers will need to consider the current state of play in international regulations and governance, seafloor exploration and pilot testing, and parallel policy efforts advanced by other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For international waters beyond countries’ sovereign EEZs, UNCLOS established the International Seabed Authority to oversee and regulate commercial activities on the seafloor. The United States is the sole major country not party to UNCLOS and only participates in the ISA as an observer, unable to sponsor applications for exploration or exploitation contracts. While the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act of 1979 theoretically tasks the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with issuing licenses for seabed minerals beyond the U.S. EEZ—with Lockheed Martin holding rights to two areas of the CCZ since 1984—the likelihood of intense diplomatic and political backlash strongly discourages both NOAA and private sector actors from unilaterally claiming seafloor minerals outside the UNCLOS framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since commencing operations in 1996, the ISA has seen seabed mineral collection evolve from a vague hypothetical into a technologically viable emerging industry. Although the authority has implemented a permitting framework for seabed mineral exploration, the original 2020 target date for finalization of a permitting system for mineral exploitation has come and gone, delaying completion of the ISA’s Mining Code. The 29th session of the ISA, in mid-2024, saw the first complete reading of the draft regulations on exploitation. The organization seeks to complete its regulatory framework by mid-2025, subsequently requiring approval by consensus from the rotating 36-member ISA Council and the 170 members of the full ISA Assembly. As per the text of UNCLOS, “consensus” means “the absence of any formal objection,” meaning any council or assembly member can stall codification of ISA regulations. With a growing list of 32 member countries calling for a precautionary pause or moratorium on deep sea mining until the ISA formalizes robust regulations—or until researchers can study potential environmental impacts more extensively—this approval process faces a real risk of failing to reach consensus over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, U.S. policymakers would be remiss in deprioritizing seafloor minerals on account of the ISA’s sluggishness. The authority only governs mineral collection on the international seafloor, leaving countries free to pursue activities within their own EEZ boundaries. While some countries have committed to applying the ISA’s Mining Code to guide permitting of mineral exploitation activities in their own EEZs, this is voluntary and not universal practice. As such, commercial seabed mining in territorial waters may potentially outpace policy developments at the ISA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISA regulations are also steadily progressing as underwater technology improves and scientific knowledge accumulates. The newly elected secretary general of the ISA, Leticia Carvalho, has expressed determination to maintain the authority’s neutrality as a decisionmaking forum, as well as delivering a consensus by 2025 on how member states will approach finalizing the Mining Code. Such efforts will gradually facilitate consensus building at the ISA sooner or later. Given the current pace of resource mapping and collector-system testing, a finalized permitting framework will likely see nodule collection efforts move rapidly to full-scale production, spearheaded by both Chinese and Western companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Chinese operators are moving ambitiously to develop international seabed resources, aiming to become first movers once regulations fall into place. Overlooked by most media reporting and unhindered by environmental activists, Chinese research institutions, state-owned enterprises, and private sector partners are investing significant efforts into resource surveys and technology development for the exploitation of the three main seafloor mineral resource types. This network of corporations and research centers can fully study, finance, build, and operate all components of a maritime minerals industry, including robots, specialized vessels, and onshore ore processing facilities. Many of these deep sea mapping, monitoring, and robotics platforms possess military dual-use value for submarine, anti-submarine, and reconnaissance operations and for targeting seafloor pipelines and cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s multi-sector deep sea mining industry efforts, which enjoy clear national policy backing, stand in stark contrast with the United States’ nonexistent seafloor minerals strategy. The Chinese state-owned firms Beijing Pioneer and China Minmetals Corporation plan to conduct nodule collector field tests in 2025. Beijing is also the largest financial contributor to the ISA and plays an active role in negotiations, vocally advocating for a firm pathway toward finalizing the ISA’s regulations on exploitation. Overall, China holds five ISA exploration contracts, the most of any single country: three for nodules, one for ferromanganese crust, and one for polymetallic sulfides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the remaining 26 ISA contracts, U.S. partners through NATO and the Minerals Security Partnership hold a total of 15 contracts, including 8 for nodules. However, only Belgium, India, Japan, and South Korea have shown clear interest in developing minerals on the international seafloor, while the remaining 4 contracts for nodules belong to U.S. allies—Germany, the United Kingdom, and France—that have expressed some opposition to near-term commercial-scale nodule collection. Importantly, small island states hold an additional 5 nodule exploration contracts, 4 of which—Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, and Tonga—partner with U.S.- and Canada-based companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, current international nodule exploration efforts remain competitive with Chinese programs from a technological, business, and resource-quantity perspective but exhibit more vulnerabilities to activist opposition and shifting national policies. The selection of players that will emerge as early leaders in nodule collection and related deep sea technologies thus remains an open question—one the United States still has opportunities to shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-5&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to China’s efforts—characterized by significant capital investment, active ISA participation, and the tight integration of government, academic, and industry work—the United States essentially does not possess a national policy strategy on seafloor minerals. Over the past three decades, the federal government has not moved meaningfully to update and modernize regulations governing offshore minerals and has undertaken only sporadic efforts to research seabed mining. Broader underinvestment in critical minerals supply chains, such as the current lack of any operating domestic nickel- or cobalt-refining facilities, also inhibits U.S. competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might conclude that Washington should seek to ratify UNCLOS to gain access to polymetallic nodules and other resources and secure stronger legal protections for the United States’ extended continental shelf. However, ISA membership will only allow U.S. access to nodules over the long term. The immediate benefit of ratifying UNCLOS would be geopolitical: The United States has endeavored to protect freedom of maritime navigation with neither the ability to hold leadership positions at UNCLOS institutions nor access to the UNCLOS dispute settlement framework, while also enduring accusations of hypocrisy for enforcing a treaty it is not party to. At the ISA, it would be playing catch-up, with limited ability to help formulate initial ISA Mining Code rules, regulations, and procedures. Meanwhile, the United States would require significant lead time to directly sponsor new applications that secure contracts to explore and exploit international seabed resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While accession to UNCLOS would greatly strengthen U.S. maritime interests, political constraints pose obstacles not only to Senate ratification but also to seafloor mineral policy in general. Some conservative policymakers have consistently blocked UNCLOS ratification, arguing that participation would require the United States to relinquish sovereign powers to international institutions. Meanwhile, the State of Hawaii recently joined California, Oregon, and Washington in enacting a moratorium on mineral exploitation in state coastal waters (which typically extend to 3 nautical miles offshore). These moratoria pose minor implications for critical minerals, as the vast majority of hardrock mineral deposits are located further offshore. Yet these state policies highlight interest from other, liberal political coalitions in opposing ocean mineral exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such political tripwires pose difficulties for developing seafloor mineral policies that can secure bipartisan support. However, measures to establish downstream U.S. access to polymetallic nodules, coupled with support for offshore resource mapping, deep sea technology development, and onshore nodule processing, may be able to attract broader political buy-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near term, the United States should strive to position itself as a promising destination for processing nodules and incorporating refined minerals into the domestic battery supply chain. One of the advantages of nodule resources is that the United States could receive nodule materials without holding ISA contracts of its own, as long as domestic facilities can refine the metals competitively. Inaction will allow Chinese metallurgical industries to master nodule processing, gaining a monopoly even on nodules collected by non-Chinese operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the United States can pursue several actions to gain advantages in this sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarify existing policies to better support development of a domestic processing sector.&lt;/strong&gt; The domestic critical minerals component of the IRA’s 30D EV tax credit provides a strong incentive for battery and EV manufacturers to source eligible metals mined or processed domestically or by free trade agreement (FTA) partners. Yet neither the IRA nor subsequent Department of Treasury guidance has addressed the eligibility of minerals sourced from the international seafloor. Clarification that collected nodules brought to the United States and FTA partners as the first port of call would count toward the Treasury Department’s Traced Qualifying Value Add Test for the 30D credit would incentivize bringing harvested nodules to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fund research and pilot projects for nodule processing.&lt;/strong&gt; Mineral recovery from nodules will require different processing steps and workflows, opening a window for new market entry. Onshore processing of nodules will likely utilize many smelting and chemical-leach processes either in wide practice or with previous commercial-scale precedent. But polymetallic nodules are not a standard feed material for metallurgical refineries and will require unique process flowsheets, of which industry actors are currently engaged in lab and pilot-scale testing. Full process demonstration and product quality verification help operators prove their viability and move toward full-scale projects. As such, nodule-processing pilot and demonstration projects could benefit greatly from Department of Energy and Department of Defense awards through the IRA’s 48C credit, the Defense Production Act Title III office, and the Loan Programs Office.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But making the United States a destination for harvested nodules depends on the overall economic viability of domestic mineral-processing operations. As such, broader efforts to improve the competitiveness of domestic processing and refining—through affordable energy inputs, permitting reforms, and policy interventions to combat price volatility—will also help make the United States more attractive as a host country for downstream industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate polymetallic nodule collection into the United States’ international critical minerals strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of State should proactively identify opportunities to expand the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) to countries that ambitiously pursue nodule collection. Diplomatic engagement, technical assistance, and facilitated financing could strengthen early efforts by states such as the Cook Islands, Jamaica, or Nauru to develop nodule resources. Such partner countries could even consider sponsoring U.S. firms to explore or exploit nodules on the international seabed. Policymakers can similarly coordinate with existing MSP partners such as India, Japan, or South Korea that are advancing EEZ seafloor mineral exploration efforts. Robust diplomatic efforts can not only help diversify supply chains but also create new avenues for U.S. access to nodules.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deepen scientific understanding of seafloor minerals to improve public opinion, study offshore mineral potential, and advance better environmental and economic outcomes.&lt;/strong&gt; Infrequent policy attention toward offshore hardrock minerals over the past few decades has left much of the extended continental shelf unexplored by modern oceanographic sensing techniques. Surveying efforts can support and expand upon the efforts of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and U.S. Geological Survey to catalog a National Offshore Critical Mineral Inventory, potentially identifying promising new U.S. offshore deposits through mapping and characterization. Other research should seek to quantify industry-related questions such as life-cycle environmental impacts and economic feasibility. Many of these activities can inform longer-term modernization of federal regulations for leasing and permitting offshore minerals. Federal agencies can also help engage environmental activists’ concerns through reports that review the scientific literature on potential impacts from seafloor nodule collection, track advances in collection system technologies, and highlight remaining questions and opportunities for impact mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined, these actions can position the United States far more competitively on polymetallic nodules, a substantial new critical minerals resource with the most promise for sustainable and economic development among known seabed mineral deposit types. Nodule collection can allow the United States to dramatically diversify four key metal supply chains for the clean energy transition while simultaneously reducing environmental impacts associated with these raw materials. Decisive policy efforts in this area can also strengthen nationally important industries such as robotics and deep sea capabilities, enhance U.S. overseas partnerships, and elevate U.S. leadership in strategic international forums. A new Congress and executive administration should not hesitate to integrate seafloor nodules into the nation’s critical minerals strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Leading mining practices today can ensure that critical minerals are produced with minimal freshwater use, a small footprint on land, few if any local or global air pollutants, and a net-positive impact on plants and animals.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction-1&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining is an ancient industry, with evidence of copper piping used in Egypt from 2500 BC and other more basic uses of metals and minerals stretching back many centuries further. Yet modern and responsible mines bear little resemblance to the rudimentary and often damaging practices of bygone eras. Leading mining practices today can ensure that critical minerals are produced with minimal freshwater use, a small footprint on land, few if any local or global air pollutants, and a net-positive impact on plants and animals. In addition, such projects enjoy the support of local communities and Indigenous peoples; contribute to local and regional economic development through jobs, taxes, and infrastructure; and ensure the health and safety of workers and neighbors. Many such examples exist in the United States and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet for every example of responsible mining, there are numerous examples of irresponsible practices, past and present. Polluted lands and water, a depleted state of nature, and long-term health impacts on workers and communities are a reality for many mining communities today. At least 23 million people are estimated to live on floodplains contaminated by potentially harmful concentrations of toxic waste from metal mining. Mining activities have also often been linked to human rights violations, conflict, and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any industry—particularly one as diverse as mining, which has an estimated 25,000 companies operating in 140 countries globally—has a range of responsible and irresponsible actors. The reputation of the overall industry is shaped disproportionately by the actions of the less responsible, setting in motion a vicious cycle that continues to create the space for irresponsible mining. A poor reputation for mining overall means less public and community support for new mines, which discourages responsible companies from seeking to operate, especially as developing a new mine can require billions of dollars before the first ore is extracted. Land is thus left open for illegal and irresponsible operators to take over, often undetected—as mining activities often take place in remote locations, governments may struggle to enforce local laws and regulations (where they exist), particularly in countries where the state has less capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may be impossible to eliminate all irresponsible mining everywhere, it is possible to make responsible mining the norm in the United States and its allied countries. Doing so requires action on three fronts: regulatory measures, voluntary standards, and market mechanisms. Each is discussed below, and regulatory measures are covered in more detail in Chapter 10 by Morgan Bazilian and Gregory Wischer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regulatory-measures&quot;&gt;REGULATORY MEASURES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining is by nature a highly regulated industry in the United States and in most countries. Aside from mining-specific laws, a range of environmental, social, and economic legislation typically applies, such as the National Environment Policy Act and the Clean Water Act. Both are necessary and potentially useful, as they provide the requisite infrastructure through which to ensure responsible mining practices. Yet there are several challenges regarding the application of regulatory measures to mining. A new mine can require hundreds—and in some cases, thousands—of permitting obligations, take years of effort prior to approval, and put significant financial investment at risk. The substance of these requirements, however, are essential social and environmental safeguards that should be preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is industry and government consensus that there is excessive bureaucracy, uncertainty, and complexity in current legislation and its application in the United States. Globally, there is data for 127 mines that have come online since 2002 and the discovery-to-production process has taken an average of 15.7 years. The United States is significantly behind the global average. A recent study by S&amp;amp;P Global on behalf of the U.S. National Mining Association showed that the country has the second-longest mine development times in the world, at almost 29 years on average from first discovery to first production—second only to Zambia, at 34 years. The rate of slow mine development is problematic. The expected demand for copper alone is likely to result in the need for between 35 and 195 large new copper mines over the next 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, then, can the permitting process be streamlined while maintaining strong social and environmental safeguards? There are three important methods the U.S. government can consider, drawing from the experience of other jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement a “one-stop-shop” mechanism.&lt;/strong&gt; While the form of this mechanism will no doubt vary from country to country, it would not only cut through the complex systems of regulations but, crucially, could also ensure authorities strike the right balance between fast-tracking applications and implementing social and environmental safeguards. For instance, the EU Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) allows for “strategic projects” (defined as those that extract identified strategic raw materials) to benefit from a streamlined and predictable process to help project developers navigate the national permitting systems. This approach is designed to expedite permits through a single authority and administrative system, while at the same time ensuring that environmental review, public participation, and sustainability remain embedded in the approval process. This is difficult—if not impossible—to achieve without a single point of contact. Other countries that already have or are considering similar single-point systems include Chile, Oman, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set some “non-negotiable” elements while allowing flexibility in others, ensuring that expedited permitting can go hand in hand with high standards.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, the CRMA’s non-negotiable requirements include compliance with the conditions set in the directives on habitats (92/43/EEC), water (2000/60/EC), and birds (2009/147/EC), as well as in the European Union’s recent Nature Restoration Law. If it meets these criteria, a strategic project can benefit from the expedited permitting process even if it has residual negative impacts in other areas. Another way the CRMA strikes this balance is to exclude the time the project developer takes to complete the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) from the rapid-approval time window. This exclusion is because the EIA is the responsibility of the project developer, and it ensures that the EIA process is not unduly rushed and that steps are not skipped. With this protection in place, the act further streamlines the process by requiring that a decision on “screening” under the EIA directive (2011/92/EU) should be made within 30 days, rather than a previous timeframe of 90 days, and that the maximum time for public participation in the EIA process should not exceed 85 days.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinate, cross-link, or “nest” requirements of different acts within one another.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, in Western Australia, the Mining Act and the Environmental Protection Act are coordinated. In addition, the country’s Department of Mines and Petroleum has a memorandum of understanding with its Environmental Protection Authority that delegates certain tasks to the former. Various conditions—in accordance with various laws—are appended to the licenses obtained under the Mining Act. Furthermore, the Mining Act links the granting of mining rights to provisions on how the environment should be handled. This effectively consolidates all environmental provisions within the legislation, in turn ensuring a streamlined and administratively efficient process while minimizing gaps and overlaps that could lead to poor environmental or social outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But regulatory reform is only one way to encourage responsible mining. An often more powerful lever is the effect of voluntary standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;voluntary-standards&quot;&gt;VOLUNTARY STANDARDS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, numerous voluntary standards for responsible mining have been developed, mostly initiated by the mining industry itself. One of the earliest examples is the Mining Principles put forth by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) in 2003. Adopting these principles is a condition of membership for the organization’s 24 mining and metals companies, which collectively make up approximately one-third of the global industry across 650 sites in over 50 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other notable examples include the Towards Sustainable Mining program developed by the Mining Association of Canada, which has now been adopted in several other countries; the Copper Mark, which brings together the mining and business components across the value chain through a robust assurance system; and the Responsible Gold Mining Principles developed by the World Gold Council. Each of these standards aims to promote continuous improvements in responsible mining practices for the facilities that voluntarily elect to adopt them. There are important differences across them, however, as they have varying levels of breadth (number of topics covered), depth (the specificity of performance requirements), governance (who decides what is or is not covered by the standard and how claims are assessed), and assurance systems (how third-party verifiers are required to substantiate claims made against the standard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to “upstream” or mining-specific standards, various “downstream” or product-specific standards have also been developed, including, among others, ResponsibleSteel and the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative. These standards are focused on individual commodities and therefore seek to cover all stages of the value chain, from the initial extraction of the ore through the various processing stages to the development of the final product. They are best thought of as “product-back” standards that contrast with the upstream systems, which can be seen as “mining-forward.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge today is that the mining companies that self-identify as being responsible often apply multiple voluntary standards, which adds significant costs and audit burdens in addition to causing confusion and complexity for stakeholders. On the other hand, large portions of the 25,000-strong overall mining industry adopt no voluntary standards at all, thus escaping the scrutiny and discipline that come with the disclosure requirements associated with these standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are ways to maximize the effectiveness of voluntary standards as a tool to drive more responsible mining. Primary among these methods is support for the consolidation of existing standards. The current landscape of voluntary standards is crowded, confusing, and cumbersome for both the companies that apply them and the stakeholders who rely on them. ICMM, the Mining Association of Canada, the Copper Mark, and the World Gold Council are already in the process of consolidating their standards into one global system with independent, multistakeholder oversight. Additional efforts should be supported by resisting any attempts to create further standards and incorporating—where relevant and appropriate—compliance with high-quality voluntary standards, as the European Union refers to in its Critical Raw Materials Act. Conformity with high-quality voluntary standards could also be made a condition of public procurement to help scale up adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voluntary and regulatory mechanisms can be complementary tools to drive the widespread adoption of responsible mining practices. However, there is a third category of actions that is necessary to enable the maximum uptake of such practices: market mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;market-mechanisms&quot;&gt;MARKET MECHANISMS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While metals and minerals are bought and sold in a variety of ways, including direct sales from producers to customers (who may still transform or on-sell the product), commodity exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or London Metal Exchange (LME), and illegally or “off-the-books” trading, particularly in the case of precious metals such as gold. By and large, individual tons of a particular commodity of a specified grade are indistinguishable from each other and have the same essential chemical and physical properties, irrespective of whether they were produced using responsible or irresponsible methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fungibility of metals gives rise to a major challenge in making responsible mining the norm. Put bluntly, as long as there are both a clean-but-expensive way of mining and a cheap-but-dirty way, many will choose the latter since the customer cannot usually tell the difference based purely on the attributes of the product. This is different from, for example, farm produce, for which irresponsible practices such as excessive use of fertilizer could be ascertained through visual or chemical testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perverse incentive for irresponsible practices is made worse by the lack of a well-developed mechanism for pricing metals differently based on their provenance or quality of production. This is most acute in the case of commodity trading platforms such as the LME, which essentially uses a single reference price for a commodity. The LME has responsible sourcing requirements traders must satisfy before being able to do business on the platform, theoretically setting a “floor” of responsible mining practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, beyond this, there are few if any mechanisms currently available on exchanges such as the LME to allow commodities to be priced higher if they have been produced more responsibly or, conversely, priced lower if they lack certain assurances on their provenance or performance on sustainability criteria. This has come into sharp focus in the case of nickel, where the divergence between responsible and irresponsible practices can be quite large. In particular, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with production can vary by orders of magnitude even within the same class of nickel, which is based on method of production. Despite a growing call, particularly from Western producers, for the LME to introduce differential pricing for “green nickel,” the exchange has not yet moved to create such tiered pricing, citing a lack of liquidity and critical mass and highlighting the risk of the market not working efficiently if contracts were to be subdivided further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge lies in defining “green.” There is as much debate about what metrics should be considered (should it only be greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental factors, or should it also include social performance?) as what data would be used and how it would be collected and assured (would site-level Scope 1 and 2 emissions suffice, or would it need to include upstream and downstream Scope 3 emissions, too?). The lack of clarity around these issues has curtailed the development of tiered pricing mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, operators that do not appear to follow any voluntary codes have flooded the market with metal produced amid credible allegations of environmental destruction. This has caused the shuttering of large nickel companies that do follow voluntary responsible mining practices, such as the Nickel West operations and the West Musgrave project in Australia. This trend can be expected to continue unless there are efforts made to reward those following responsible practices through some form of price mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These risks to market efficiency are real and need careful work and attention—especially given the even bigger challenge posed by not having clear market mechanisms to incentivize responsible production. The solution may not be merely to institute a “green premium,” but could include provisions such as tiered pricing in public procurement or other requirements for market access. However, these proposals all depend on having clear and commonly accepted definitions of “green” and “responsible” production, hence the need for consolidation and harmonization of voluntary standards, as previously mentioned, and clarity on how these fit with regulatory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-6&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the analysis of regulatory, voluntary, and market mechanisms to encourage responsible practices, the U.S. government should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a national panel on mining.&lt;/strong&gt; This idea emanates from the Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM) voluntary scheme developed by the Mining Association of Canada. The TSM Community of Interest Panel is an independent group of stakeholders, communities, and nongovernmental organizations that oversees the implementation of the standards program. Consisting of 12 to 15 members, the panel is designed to provide guidance to auditors and implementers on the issues of particular importance and resonance in the local context.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States could benefit from importing and adapting this panel structure, even if it currently does not and may never adopt the TSM program. Such panels, which include cross-stakeholder dialogue leading to improved understanding and trust building, are useful and important in their own right, even if not anchored to a voluntary scheme. A U.S. version could help shape domestic regulation, inform policy discussions, and resolve conflicts. And it may not need to be a single body but could instead involve multiple panels for different regions. Engaging the National Mining Association to explore the feasibility of such a mechanism would be an appropriate early step.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate voluntary responsible mining standards into trade agreements.&lt;/strong&gt; Over the past 10–20 years, governments in both producing and consuming countries have increasingly incorporated voluntary sustainability standards into trade policy instruments—particularly free trade agreements (FTAs)—to address environmental, social, and economic concerns regarding commodity production and trade. Before 2018, there were only 17 FTAs worldwide referring to Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS) across different sectors. However, almost half of all new agreements over the following five years referred to them in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There is no notable example of voluntary responsible mining standards being included in FTAs, and research on commodity-specific standards being included in such instruments is limited and available only for certain agricultural products. Yet including such standards in trade agreements would be uniquely suited for the United States, given its importance in the global trade ecosystem and its ability to use trade to influence practices both domestically and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are different ways in which voluntary mining standards could be incorporated into trade agreements. These can range from loose to broad measures, including exchanging information on the provenance and socio-environmental performance of commodity production and promoting cooperation in areas such as labeling, to more specific aspects, such as giving preferential treatment to products that are certified under particular schemes. The most notable example of this from another sector is the European Free Trade Association (EFTA)–Indonesia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, whereby palm oil imported into Switzerland from Indonesia benefits from preferential tariff treatment if producers comply with one of three specified voluntary schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It would not necessarily be advisable to include specific criteria in the case of mining and metals given the rapidly changing landscape of responsible mining standards, but such incentives could be considered by indicating the attributes schemes need to have rather than naming particular ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support the development of “green premium” instruments.&lt;/strong&gt; Venues where commodities are traded, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, face legitimate barriers to developing instruments that would offer suppliers of responsibly produced metals a “green premium.” At the same time, the industry’s ability to voluntarily develop such mechanisms is limited by antitrust laws and regulations, which prohibit coordination action by producers who might collude to manipulate or otherwise alter prices. This gives the U.S. government the opportunity to explore various mechanisms for supporting the development of green premiums.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;First, U.S. public entities can participate in buyers’ clubs that favor and reward responsible producers of mineral-based products. A notable example is the Sustainable Steel Buyers Platform, which aims to pool demand for responsible steel from different buyers, thus giving impetus and scale to the producers of these commodities. Having a deliberate focus to participate in such initiatives can ensure that through their sizeable purchases of minerals, U.S. public entities help grow the market for responsibly produced products.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Second, the United States can facilitate or lead the development of a multilateral pilot initiative among leading Western commodity exchanges to assess the feasibility of pooling trading activities in a way that provides large enough markets for contracts to be priced based on sustainability criteria. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the London Metal Exchange would be the most obvious participants in such a pilot. This could be funded by the U.S. government, thereby overcoming one of the main barriers holding back the development of such instruments: the lack of liquidity in any individual exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-10&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a segment of society that believes any form of extraction from the earth is by definition irresponsible, the term “responsible mining” seems an oxymoron. Yet mineral production can incorporate a wide range of responsible practices. Given the essential role of metals and minerals in modern society and the reality of the need to extract significantly greater quantities in the future, there is perhaps no more urgent question than how to make this production as responsible as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has an essential role to play in this regard, both domestically and abroad. The three most salient actions the U.S. government can take include establishing a national panel on responsible mining, incorporating voluntary standards into trade frameworks, and supporting the development of green-premium instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Washington cannot assume that traditional alliances or free trade agreement status indicate alignment with U.S. security interests.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ dependence on foreign rivals, especially the People’s Republic of China (PRC), for critical and strategic minerals presents a material vulnerability to its industrial, energy, and defense sectors. This vulnerability quietly developed over decades, only coming to public attention in 2010 after Beijing banned the export of rare earth elements (REEs) to Japan. Although Washington has elevated critical minerals as a top security issue, the United States remains dependent on an increasingly adversarial China. This chapter explores the importance and urgency of the United States developing resilient and secure critical minerals supply chains and recommends a comprehensive strategy to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-not-learned&quot;&gt;LESSONS (NOT) LEARNED&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ dependency was decades in the making. The United States and Europe were both happy to offshore low-margin and oftentimes heavy and polluting industries to other nations and import the refined goods on a just-in-time basis. This system worked well for years. However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has forced Washington to confront its out-of-sight, out-of-mind reliance on China multiple times across the past three presidential administrations. Presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden each responded to China’s provocative actions differently—but incompletely, given its continued dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-obama-years&quot;&gt;The Obama Years&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Obama assumed office as China dramatically increased its military spending, replaced Japan as the United States’ largest foreign creditor, and in 2010 became the world’s second-largest economy. During his term, Beijing publicly launched the Belt and Road Initiative, a strategy of coercive investments designed in part to lock up natural resources for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Japan detained a Chinese trawler captain after repeated instances of illegal fishing and ramming Japanese coast guard vessels. In response, China temporarily banned the export of REEs to Japan and implied that it would impose new quotas. These actions skyrocketed REE prices by more than 400 percent, drawing condemnation from Washington and Brussels. In response, the Obama administration (joined by Japan and the European Union) initiated a World Trade Organization (WTO) case against China in 2012, stating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now, if China would simply let the market work on its own, we’d have no objections. But their policies currently are preventing that from happening. And they go against the very rules that China agreed to follow. Being able to manufacture advanced batteries and hybrid cars in America is too important for us to stand by and do nothing. We’ve got to take control of our energy future, and we can’t let that energy industry take root in some other country because they were allowed to break the rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) criticized the WTO case. He said, “There are faster ways to assert leverage on China than relying on the WTO, which could take years to resolve the case.” He instead called to restrict Chinese mining in the United States and limit World Bank funding of PRC mining projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two years of deliberations, the WTO finally concluded in 2014 that China violated trade rules. The U.S. trade representative Michael Froman stated, “By upholding rules on fair access to raw materials, this decision is a win not only for the United States, but also for every nation that respects the principles of openness and fairness. Those principles are the pillars of the rules-based global trading system, and we must protect them vigilantly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than restrict exports, China flooded the market with supplies, sending prices crashing. In less than a year after the United States won in the WTO, its only REE mine filed for bankruptcy protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two terms of the Obama administration witnessed a rising and more brazen and provocative China. In response, Washington looked to well-intended, albeit conventional, remedies such as diplomatic convenings and Brenton Woods–era institutions to help settle disputes. However, the United States was unable to limit China’s rising dominance of the critical mineral sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experience showed that conventional mechanisms are only effective when countries agree to the conventions themselves. Since China rejects them, the United States needs to consider an alternative approach to the traditional rules-based order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-trump-years&quot;&gt;The Trump Years&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the Trump administration viewed critical minerals as a proxy for U.S. economic and national security. In December 2017, Trump issued an executive order directing the Department of the Interior to develop a critical minerals list. The resulting May 2018 report identified 35 minerals considered critical to the economic and national security interests of the United States, which informed the interagency’s focus areas. The report helped increase awareness of the PRC’s control of critical mineral supply chains, beginning in emerging markets targeted by the Belt and Road Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of State created new bilateral and multilateral initiatives, such as the Energy Resources Governance Initiative (ERGI), to lay the foundation for alternative investment channels to the PRC. For example, when the PRC sought to make major investments to secure critical minerals in Greenland, ERGI enabled the Bureau of Energy Resources to pursue a series of diplomatic engagements that successfully culminated in memorandums of understanding to support Greenland’s geologic endowment and preference U.S. and allied investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, ERGI sought to elevate transparency, support mineral-producing countries, and eventually leverage the newly established U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to provide seed capital to de-risk projects and attract otherwise reputation-sensitive investors. However, the administration was unable to implement its permitting reform ideas, and although historic, the DFC made only one critical minerals investment. Moreover, as the Trump administration utilized existing tools such as tariffs and diplomatic initiatives, it faced domestic permitting obstacles and lacked adequate financing tools to support many U.S.-based and U.S.-backed mining projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with new initiatives and approaches, the U.S. government must do more to support domestic and allied investment to develop a secure critical minerals supply chain. This may require establishing new government tools while rethinking and optimizing existing ones to fit the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-biden-years&quot;&gt;The Biden Years&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden sought to return the United States to a more conventional diplomatic position. He rescinded certain Trump-era energy sanctions (such as on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline), called for a review of China-directed tariffs, and immediately directed the administration to reenter the Paris climate accord. In further contrast to the Trump administration’s focus on national security and defense, the Biden administration prioritized the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding that meeting its ambitious climate change and clean energy goals would require an exponential increase in critical minerals, President Biden issued Executive Order 14017 in February 2021, which mandated comprehensive reviews of supply chains across the U.S. government. The Department of the Interior issued a new critical minerals list, adding 15 new minerals, bringing the total to 50. Meanwhile, the Department of Energy (DOE) released its own new critical materials list for energy. The DOE material list rightly included copper as a “critical” mineral, but the USGS list excluded it, even though it is vital for every part of the modern U.S. economy—including infrastructure, clean energy technologies, electronics, and automotives—and the International Energy Agency has forecasted a copper shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) established new federal programs, incentives, and, importantly, billions of dollars in funding to support clean energy supply chains. The Biden administration channeled much of those direct grants and loans into domestic minerals processing and clean-tech manufacturing facilities, which should improve domestic capacities in both. The IRA has been so effective in attracting clean-tech investment that it has alarmed European partners, who sought to force “concessions” from President Biden to allow EU companies to benefit from certain IRA subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of State’s Minerals Security Partnership seeks to accelerate the development of a clean energy supply chain by convening governments and industry. The department also leads the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which aims to promote mining-related investment, such as the Lobito Corridor project. In addition, the DFC increased its investment in Techmet, a technology metals company, from $25 million to $105 million but has not diversified equity-level investments in any other mining investors or operating companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s prioritization of climate action above other issues has contributed to pragmatic but conflicting messages. The IRA prohibits U.S. taxpayer funds from going to a “foreign entity of concern,” which covers firms controlled by China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. However, China is by far the largest and least expensive critical minerals producer and clean-tech manufacturer in the world. To disqualify Chinese content from receiving taxpayer subsidies, as per the law, would increase prices—making electric vehicles unattractive to many American buyers. Therefore, the Department of the Treasury amended its rules in December 2023 to allow up to 25 percent of otherwise disqualified Chinese content to receive U.S. taxpayer subsidies under the IRA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s actions appear to have had an impact. Beijing went back to the 2010 playbook, announcing curbs on the export of gallium, germanium, graphite, antimony, and REE technology. China furthermore flooded the market with cobalt, crashing prices and putting the United States’ only cobalt development project into care and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these experiences across administrations, developing a responsible and secure clean energy supply chain will require two things to be effective. First, the government needs to have absolute clarity of mission in recognizing the challenge the United States is trying to overcome. Second, there must be accountability to guard against mission creep and navigate the complexity and equities across the government. This will entail marshaling the United States’ limited resources around the mission to optimize impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-us-critical-minerals-strategy&quot;&gt;A U.S. CRITICAL MINERALS STRATEGY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China remains the world’s dominant producer, processor, and buyer of critical minerals. The CCP continues to push domestic policies that artificially stimulate demand for its strategic sectors, mobilize state financing to influence market dynamics, and shirk environmental and human rights protections to produce commodities at the lowest cost. These are long-standing tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is still behind, but over the past three presidential administrations, it has learned a great deal, gained political support, and increased its tools and capabilities to develop a meaningful and comprehensive response. However, an effective strategy will require a blending of the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations’ approaches and will test domestic and international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mission-clarity&quot;&gt;Mission Clarity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should be clear about its objective. National security and climate change are both important and interrelated, but the U.S. government ultimately needs to prioritize one over the other. It is hard to imagine how the world can address climate change by increasing reliance on China, the world’s super polluter, to produce inputs for clean energy technologies. The United States can and should develop a responsible and secure critical minerals supply chain necessary for economic growth, defense, and clean energy. However, realizing such a goal while reducing reliance on CCP-backed industry will be more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has repeatedly tried to strike a middle road by partnering with China on climate change but holding firm on core principles such as human rights and environmental standards in critical minerals supply chains. The CCP has rejected such attempts. Rather the PRC rejects the primacy of addressing climate change and instead views the matter as a core point of contention within the U.S.-China bilateral relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although disappointing, the CCP’s approach is rational from its perspective. The party-state is motivated first to advance its interests and second to increase its leverage or control over the United States and the rest of the world. By dominating the critical minerals supply chain, China forces the United States to increase its dependence on its adversary—and therefore forces Washington to question its security positioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should be clear in its mission to develop secure and responsible critical minerals supply chains. Successive administrations have repeatedly recognized that China dominates the production and refining of critical minerals—and thus also the defense industry and clean tech. To contest this threat, the White House should explicitly articulate its intention to develop secure supply chains and phase down reliance on China—not to provoke hostile powers but to galvanize interested stakeholders. Clear and unequivocal goal setting will signal to partner governments, resource-rich countries, and investors that the United States is on the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;accountability-and-coordination&quot;&gt;Accountability and Coordination&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should have a single point of accountability to oversee and coordinate the administration’s multiple lines of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided historic levels of federal funding and new programs to develop clean energy and critical minerals supply chains. This explosion in funding coincided with the dramatic expansion of agencies working on critical minerals. Under the Biden administration, when counting, 15 federal agencies claim a meaningful role in U.S. critical minerals policy. While the increased interest is a positive development, the lack of clear oversight and management of such a complex set of issues can lead to inefficiencies or agencies working at cross-purposes, which may frustrate the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remedy this, the U.S. government should appoint or designate a special presidential coordinator at a minimum of an ambassadorial level to manage the critical minerals portfolio. This will be a difficult but necessary role: Although every federal agency or cabinet member may have an interest, some interests are more consequential to achieving the mission than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this special coordinator should align U.S. policies to address the country’s current pacing challenge. As mentioned, the IRA has accelerated domestic clean energy–related manufacturing. However, the United States has not taken sufficient action to increase supplies of the critical mineral inputs needed to feed these new gigafactories and industrial facilities. It may only take 5 years to build a plant but some 15 years to turn a discovered resource into a producing mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;update-finance-tools&quot;&gt;Update Finance Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should update and integrate its mission into international finance tools. The country has just two such financing entities: the DFC and the Export–Import Bank (EXIM). Both should have a clear critical minerals mandate and be empowered to act upon it, as well as the flexibility and resources to respond to the challenges of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFC was designed to advance U.S. foreign policy, which is why the secretary of state serves as the chairman of the agency’s board. Yet, as the name suggests, the DFC must also consider a “development” impact. However, the statute does not provide a framework for weighing or prioritizing these factors. The U.S. government should be clear about its goals and financing, particularly as mining is such a long-term endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFC’s equity and debt tools are intended to catalyze private sector investments into key industries in emerging market countries. However, the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, like the DFC itself, chooses to treat equity investments as if they were grants, which for accounting purposes are treated as a loss. Furthermore, when the equity investment realizes its returns, those funds are returned to the Department of the Treasury, not the DFC. This accounting treatment significantly limits the agency’s ability to make the requisite investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scoring problem is a historical practice, not a statutory requirement. The White House could remedy the situation by issuing new scoring criteria but appears unwilling to take on that political fight without an express congressional mandate to do so. As such, Congress should provide that directive and make the United States’ primary international finance tool appropriate for the realities of the market and geopolitical statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFC’s investments should be both strategic and commercial. With those goals in mind, and to improve political support for an expanded remit, the DFC should prioritize investments in domestic companies. Currently, there is no preference to support U.S. companies with U.S. taxpayer dollars over foreign parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EXIM Bank is the United States’ export credit agency (ECA). The 90-year-old institution must compete against the 115 foreign ECAs around the world, especially from the PRC. In its 2019 reauthorization, Congress recognized the threat and strength of China’s investments and directed EXIM to establish the China Transformational Exports Program (CTEP). Through CTEP, EXIM gained greater flexibility to lend to projects focused on 10 strategic industries, including critical minerals. Congress should continue to build upon CTEP and further lower the domestic content requirements that constrain EXIM’s lending authorities. The bank should also have the clear ability to provide debt financing at the company rather than project level. By providing company-level lines of credit, EXIM can empower U.S. companies to take advantage of strategic projects in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has two important international finance tools. The DFC and EXIM must be rightsized for the challenges of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;permitting-reform-at-long-last&quot;&gt;Permitting Reform, at Long Last&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has long been talking about, but doing little to improve, its permitting process. The federal permitting process has grown into a complex and uncertain process regardless of project type, whether related to a natural gas pipeline or solar power installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bipartisan members of Congress have advocated for permitting reform but have made little substantive progress over the years. The exhaustive federal permitting process is a main obstacle to meeting the IRA’s clean energy goals. The IRA contains billions of dollars to develop clean energy networks, which will require the construction of electric transmission lines and improvements to the grid. According to Representative Scott Peters (D-CA), “The problem is that the average line is taking 10 years to build, but seven years of that is process.” The timeline is even worse for mining. According to an analysis by S&amp;amp;P Global, it takes an average of 29 years to turn a discovered resource into a mine in the United States, the second-longest mine development time after Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realization that today’s exhaustive permitting process is undermining clean energy goals has helped to expand the parties calling for reform. In July 2024, Senators John Barrasso (R-WY) and Joe Manchin (I-WV) introduced the Energy Permitting Reform Act, which aims to start addressing some of these challenges. The bill proposes to improve certainty in decisionmaking by requiring a final agency decision within 150 days, reducing administrative steps, and providing clarity over the controversial Rosemont decision. The bill avoids some of the more controversial proposals, according to some industry advocates, such as tightening standing requirements to legally challenge projects or proposals to increase community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the bill has secured strong bipartisan support, environmental opposition groups have rejected the legislation, arguing that only clean energy, not oil, gas, and mining, should share in the benefits of permitting reform. The bill—which goes too far for some but not far enough for others—represents an incomplete but positive and needed step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permitting reform often includes difficult and long-standing issues, particularly concerning the history of mining in the western United States. Yet the federal government’s failure to address permitting—in the meantime allowing the purchase of minerals known to be produced in a manner inconsistent with environmental protections, respect for human rights, or inclusion of local communities—is patently wrong. The United States should address this challenge head-on, especially if mining operations are to scale up to meet current and future clean energy targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sticks&quot;&gt;Sticks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA provided billions of U.S. taxpayer-funded dollars as “carrots” to incentivize investment in clean energy technologies. Many of these carrots take the form of tax credits that seek to reduce costs for consumers. While subsidies are tried-and-true measures that can affect consumer behavior, such carrots alone are insufficient to remedy China’s critical minerals dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, “The Chinese government is seeking to become the world’s greatest superpower through predatory lending and business practices, systematic theft of intellectual property, and brazen cyber intrusions.” Specifically, the Biden administration’s supply chain report found that overreliance on China for critical minerals and materials posed national and economic security threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine a situation where China would allow the United States to out-subsidize and erode its dominant market share. After all, the CCP is the world’s leader in economic statecraft, blending coercive domestic consumption, state investment in strategic industries, provincial support of local champions, and a willful blindness toward best-practice standards. And mining has been the bedrock of Chinese domestic industrial strategy and foreign policy for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the United States should take a more active and definitive role in countering the CCP’s market-manipulating activities. Some businesses may argue that the U.S. government should go to great lengths to deal with the Chinese state and Chinese private sector separately. However, this is a fool’s errand, as there is little distinction between the two. According to Stanford’s Center on China’s Economy and Institutions, a large share of China’s economy operates in a gray zone of mixed or blended ownership: “The number of private owners with direct equity ties with the state almost tripled between 2000 and 2019, and those with indirect equity ties rose 50-fold. The analysis suggests that equity ties to the state may have aided, not constrained, the growth of China’s private sector.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should take a much more realistic approach to address the threat it faces. To start, the United States should prohibit the use of taxpayer funds to subsidize Chinese technology or critical mineral interests. Furthermore, the U.S. government should require any company receiving taxpayer funds to certify that any imported or incorporated Chinese content or technology meets reporting standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also consider critical minerals and clean energy supply chains in light of today’s new era of economic realpolitik. Washington cannot assume that traditional alliances or free trade agreement status indicate alignment with U.S. security interests. For example, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen would like the European Union to qualify for IRA subsidies even though several European EV factories are owned by Chinese companies. And in November 2022, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, together with the heads of Volkswagen and other companies, met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing to boost business ties. Such moves to increase dependence on a strategic threat weaken free nations’ shared security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as it works to strengthen traditional alliances, the United States should take a more pragmatic approach. U.S. and European officials have discussed creating a critical minerals buyers’ club, but to be credible, club membership should be dependent on more rigorous criteria than just geography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-11&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, China banned the export of REEs to Japan. In so doing, the CCP fired the first, transformative salvo in an ongoing fight to leverage its critical minerals dominance to coerce, intimidate, and extort. The United States has since learned some valuable lessons. Successive administrations have tried multiple, albeit incremental, remedies aimed at encouraging China to behave responsibly and incentivizing U.S. and allied companies to reorient their consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although meaningful, these incremental tactics have not altered the CCP’s strategy, and the United States has failed to develop secure supply chains. Building on the experience of the past three administrations, the United States should follow the above guidance to achieve its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. leaders should recognize that, given the scale of the challenge, the federal government has a meaningful role to play. Yet, the country’s comparative advantage lies instead in its dynamic and world-leading private sector. To that end, U.S. diplomacy and financial tools should be rightsized to achieve the mission. This rightsizing must also apply to domestic policy. Leaders must finally take on long-standing special interests to advance meaningful permitting policy reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has been forced to engage in a new era of economic realpolitik. This awareness requires the United States to reconsider traditional alliances and partner relationships at a company or project level. Chinese companies have expanded and, in certain instances, entrenched themselves within traditional allies’ commercial interests. As such, the U.S. government needs to guard against unintentionally supporting adversarial interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his famous speech launching the Space Race, President John F. Kennedy asked Americans “to accept a firm commitment to a new course of action, a course which will last for many years and carry very heavy costs.” Kennedy’s Apollo program was transformative for the United States’ leadership in the world and led to innumerable technological innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transforming the United States’ economic engine presents a challenge orders of magnitude greater than putting a man on the Moon. But while building secure clean energy and critical mineral supply chains will be neither easy nor inexpensive, it is increasingly vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book has highlighted the cross-cutting importance of critical minerals security for national security, economic competitiveness, and the energy transition. Minerals are the bedrock of military technologies, semiconductors, electric vehicles (EVs), and clean energy technologies. The United States’ overreliance on China has already brought dire consequences, as evidenced by the full ban on germanium, gallium, and antimony exports to the United States, alongside strict restrictions on graphite in December 2024. Addressing these challenges is not merely an economic necessity, but a national security imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strengthening U.S. critical minerals supply chains demands a comprehensive strategy focused on domestic resource development, advanced processing and recycling technologies, international partnerships, and sustainable practices. This volume explores these strategies and provides concrete recommendations for multiple dimensions of minerals security to ensure resilience and self-reliance in critical minerals supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This volume has three primary objectives with regards to critical minerals and the future of the U.S. economy. First, it shows dependence of the twenty-first-century U.S. economy on a wide range of minerals for industries such as defense, semiconductors, and clean energy—and identifies where key minerals vulnerabilities exist within these supply chains. Second, it evaluates the policies and legislative initiatives undertaken during the Biden administration, identifying both strengths and weaknesses, before providing recommendations to enhance these efforts. And finally, it puts forward a comprehensive set of recommendations in key areas for the new administration, including domestic permitting, midstream processing, international engagement, and responsible mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This volume is intended to be a resource for policymakers in the new U.S. administration and Congress, written by experts with deep expertise working with industry and government. This book shows that critical minerals have never been more important for the U.S. economy than at this critical juncture. And yet significant vulnerabilities continue to exist in the supply chain, despite the ongoing efforts by government and businesses to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three prevailing themes emerge from the rich and diverse analysis contained in these chapters. First, critical minerals are ever-more pervasive in the modern U.S. economy and crosscut all facets of defense, economic security, and energy security. Second, although the U.S. government has taken credible steps and has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in addressing vulnerabilities in the critical minerals supply chain, it remains dependent on foreign adversaries—primarily China, but also Russia for minerals such as palladium. Lastly, given the dispersion of mineral resources globally, the United States will not be able to achieve full independence in the supply chain on its own. Addressing domestic permitting bottlenecks will need to go hand-in-hand with working with allies in developed countries and the Global South to break China’s stranglehold on the global critical minerals market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fundamentally important element of any new approach to critical minerals policy must be undertaken in a strategic and integrated fashion. The interconnected policy recommendations put forward by the authors in this volume address the challenges of critical minerals dependency by promoting economic security, sustainability, and innovation. The United States urgently requires a comprehensive critical minerals strategy. By developing such an integrated approach, the United States will strengthen the foundation for industries essential to the future, including defense, semiconductors, EVs, and renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten key recommendations emerged in this volume:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-develop-a-comprehensive-incentives-package-for-mineral-production-and-processing&quot;&gt;1. Develop a comprehensive incentives package for mineral production and processing.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration should create a comprehensive incentives package focusing on minerals production and processing for vital industries, including defense, semiconductors, EVs, and energy. This strategy must go further than the CHIPS and Science Act, which was developed to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing but failed to include any support for securing the minerals needed to produce the semiconductors. Any new strategy must also be more aggressive than the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which created useful incentives to invest in critical minerals production and processing but was self-limiting, given that it only applied to the United States and countries with which it had a free trade agreement. The incentives must support domestic and international mineral production. The lack of sufficient U.S. mining supply chain investment incentives abroad has allowed China to gain control of a substantial share of resources in Latin America and Africa and export them back to China for processing. If the United States is to meaningfully loosen China’s chokehold on mineral production, it must implement incentives that reach both producers at home and investors abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minerals projects in the United States are struggling to stay competitive and remain operational amid low commodity prices and intense competition from China. Chinese mineral operations tend to use cheaper energy sources and labor to keep costs low. Additionally, projects are often heavily state subsidized, with the government serving as a buyer of last resort to manipulate markets and keep prices low. As a result, Western producers are unable to compete and in some cases are producing at a net loss. As a result, Western investors are less eager and more hesitant to invest in minerals projects in the United States and in partner nations. Incentives help these strategic projects to remain competitive and profitable by providing capital support upfront that offsets the costs and risks of mineral investments. Comprehensive incentives packages that target minerals beyond those used in EV batteries are a necessity to ensure Western private industry makes the investments now that will yield the required minerals for strategic industries in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has thus far been insufficient investment in the critical minerals needed for advanced semiconductor technologies, particularly gallium and germanium. Implementing tax credits for midstream production of minerals domestically and in key allied countries can help to ensure these complex projects get off the ground. For EVs, the 30D provision of the IRA should be modified to expand benefits beyond solely free trade agreement (FTA) countries. Few mineral-rich countries currently hold an FTA-equivalent agreement with the United States, and are therefore excluded from IRA benefits. This is a critical step to incentivize mineral-rich nations to secure offtake agreements with Western countries instead of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FEOC rules should be tightened for incentives across industries. The current FEOC threshold of 25 percent ownership is too high and means projects with significant Chinese ownership are receiving benefits subsidized by U.S. taxpayers. However, given the limited number of projects outside of China for some key minerals, eliminating all tax benefits immediately could undermine market confidence and lead to supply chain disruptions. Instead, FEOC rules should be gradually phased down to 0 percent so that only projects that align with U.S. interests receive benefits, bolstering the production of minerals that support the semiconductor, EV, energy, and defense industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-invest-in-innovation&quot;&gt;2. Invest in innovation.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy continues to be among the most innovative in the world, and the power of this innovation must be harnessed to drive technological progress, improve competitiveness, and reduce the country’s critical minerals vulnerabilities. Investments in building recycling capabilities also reduce the quantity of primary minerals that need to be mined in the future, reducing the risk of future shortages. Innovation will be particularly critical for the semiconductor and defense industries, which are the mainstay of the country’s national and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semiconductors:&lt;/strong&gt; After initially imposing export restrictions on gallium and germanium in 2024, China escalated to a full export ban of these two commodities to the United States in December 2024. The United States needs to rapidly build the technological expertise for refining gallium and germanium. Achieving the required purity levels of over 99.99 percent for the semiconductor industry necessitates specialized technology, infrastructure, and knowledge, which are currently absent. Currently, the United States has just one company refining high-purity gallium and only one facility for germanium. Establishing a research and development (R&amp;amp;D) lab could foster innovation, enhance processing capacity, reduce the industry’s environmental footprint, and reduce production costs. Targeted funding through CHIPS Act initiatives, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s R&amp;amp;D program and the Microelectronics Commons, would support advanced materials research, facilitate commercialization, and drive the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVs:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the importance of sustaining the economic competitiveness of the domestic automotive industry, the new administration should invest in R&amp;amp;D into cost-efficient, resource-abundant battery technologies and recycling technologies to strengthen the circular economy. Innovative battery technologies and the development of substitutes for scarce materials are key to alleviating resource pressures. Ongoing research into alternative battery technologies that reduce or eliminate reliance on critical minerals like cobalt must be supported by grants and collaborations with universities and startups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the Department of Energy funds laboratories for critical minerals in EVs and clean energy, the Department of Commerce should support similar initiatives for semiconductor minerals like gallium and germanium to scale refining capabilities and technologies. Likewise, the Department of Defense should similarly adopt efforts for minerals like tungsten and antimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-strengthen-stockpiling&quot;&gt;3. Strengthen stockpiling.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should establish a Critical Minerals Reserve to stabilize supply chains, mitigate geopolitical and market risks, and reduce dependence on foreign-controlled resources, using authorized market makers backed by federal loans to procure minerals from approved jurisdictions and support domestic and allied industries. The National Defense Stockpile (NDS) was created under the 1939 Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act to provide for the acquisition of critical materials to meet defense industry needs in cases of national emergency. In the event of a natural disaster, regional conflict, or large-scale war, government-owned physical reserves of minerals can provide both the U.S. military and commercial industry with minerals needed for national defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic stockpiles are increasingly put forth as a potential policy tool to not only provide materials in a national security emergency but also as a mechanism to help stabilize commodity markets. A government-run minerals stockpile can serve as a buyer of last resort for private industry. When global prices are too low for U.S. producers to compete due to subsidized Chinese production, the government could purchase minerals for the stockpile to drive demand and raise prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To strengthen mineral stockpiles, Congress should boost discrete program appropriations for the NDS Transaction Fund. From 1968 to 2022, Congress appropriated no new budget authority for minerals stockpiling. Over the past few decades, the minerals stockpile was depleted significantly, as the Department of Defense determined that over 99 percent of the stockpile was excess to the department’s needs and Congress soon authorized its disposal. As of 2023, the stockpile’s value was estimated at just 1.2 percent of its 1962 value when adjusted for inflation. Overall, the twenty-first century has seen minimal policy action around mineral stockpiling. Consequently, the NDS is significantly smaller and less powerful as a market mechanism than China’s minerals stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-adopt-a-coordinated-government-approach&quot;&gt;4. Adopt a coordinated government approach.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will need to strengthen both its mission clarity and coordination. At present, the U.S. government has yet to agree on a single critical minerals list, lacks a coordinating agency, and has incomplete incentives. The U.S. government should have a single point of accountability to oversee and coordinate the administration’s multiple lines of effort. There are currently 15 government departments and agencies working on critical minerals. While the increased interest is a positive development, the lack of clear oversight and management of such a complex set of issues can lead to inefficiencies or agencies working at cross-purposes, which may frustrate the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-support-the-implementation-of-responsible-mining-practices&quot;&gt;5. Support the implementation of responsible mining practices.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the consistent grievances with some Chinese firms is their poor environmental, social, and governance practices. This includes heavy deforestation and land degradation, low wages, failure to employ local workers, and use of bribery. Adopting responsible mining practices can differentiate the United States from China and make it a more attractive investment partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmentally and socially responsible standards are vital in mining to address the sector’s significant environmental, social, and governance challenges. They promote sustainable practices by reducing pollution, protecting biodiversity, and ensuring efficient resource use. Such standards also emphasize fair community engagement, worker safety, and ethical governance, helping to build trust and manage risks like corruption and reputational damage. They also provide helpful frameworks to be applied to new emerging frontiers for mineral extraction, like deep sea mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With growing investor and consumer demand for responsibly sourced materials, adherence to environmental and social principles improves social license to operate, regulatory compliance, access to green financing, economic feasibility, and long-term profitability for minerals projects on land and under the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voluntary standards should be consolidated into one global system with independent oversight to streamline compliance and increase the effectiveness of industry-imposed standards that are currently inconsistent and cumbersome. This could be achieved by creating a national panel on mining and incorporating standards into trade agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The federal government should fund research and pilot projects for deep sea mineral processing and work toward full-scale projects with support from programs like the Inflation Reduction Act’s 48C credit, the Defense Production Act, and the Loan Programs Office.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-bolster-financing-for-minerals-supply-chain-development&quot;&gt;6. Bolster financing for minerals supply chain development.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Defense Production Act (DPA), and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provide significant grant funding, loan guarantees, and tax credits that offer vital sources of capital for minerals projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without these financing mechanisms, few Western projects would be profitable, and few companies would be willing to invest in risky but strategic projects abroad. With government financing support, companies like Lynas Rare Earths, Syrah Resources, Albemarle Corporation, and TechMet are initiating and expanding mining and processing capacity both in the United States and in foreign partner countries. But current financing mechanisms are still not enough to compete with foreign adversaries and secure mineral resources around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limitations of the DFC, DPA, and IRA programs leave many key mining jurisdictions outside of financing mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DFC can be amended by Congress to expand its impact by allowing financing in high-income countries. The DFC’s role in fostering minerals security is still fairly new, but a number of DFC-backed investments in Brazilian nickel, South African copper, and Angolan rare earths are already making an impact by helping to mitigate risks for strategic projects in mineral rich but underdeveloped nations. The DFC can continue to foster government-to-government cooperation and grow its impact by expanding its authorities and the number of eligible nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DPA spending authority should be increased while making greater use of purchasing commitments. DPA funds can now be used for projects in not only the United States and Canada but also Australia and the United Kingdom. More eligible jurisdictions mean more strategic projects can be funded to close supply chain gaps for defense minerals. More DOD purchase commitments can sustain the capabilities that have received investments and provide industry with the demand signal and business case to make their own additional investments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Price floors are a key financing support mechanism that gives projects assurance they will remain profitable even in the face of volatile and falling commodity prices. With this price support, industry is more likely to make strategic investments, knowing their products will sell at a fixed price without being subject to uncertain market conditions vulnerable to Chinese manipulation. Price floors hedge risks and keep operational key minerals projects that serve U.S. interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these policy adjustments will augment current financing programs and allow financial support to reach mineral-rich jurisdictions that were previously left out of these opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-develop-the-critical-minerals-workforce&quot;&gt;7. Develop the critical minerals workforce.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration has estimated that more than half of the current workforce will be retired and replaced by 2029 (roughly 221,000 workers). A skilled workforce is crucial for sustaining industries reliant on critical minerals. Throughout this volume, authors have recognized the need for investments into education, training, and lifelong career learning. Workforce development programs focusing on technical training in mining, materials science, processing and refining, defense applications, and advanced manufacturing will prepare the American labor force to support resilient domestic supply chains and maintain technological leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new administration should work with Congress to establish a National Critical Minerals Workforce Initiative, leveraging federal programs like WIOA and tax incentives. This would help address workforce challenges by supporting education in key fields, fostering community college certifications, and integrating regional training centers into the American Job Centers network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing investments in workforce development, leveraging successful initiatives like the Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) program’s National Imperative for Industrial Skills (NIIS), would strengthen recruitment, training, and retention efforts in key sectors such as critical minerals through active partnerships and regionally focused activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-streamline-the-domestic-permitting-process&quot;&gt;8. Streamline the domestic permitting process.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States is to effectively boost domestic production of critical minerals, a number of serious challenges in the domestic permitting process must be overcome. A streamlined permitting process reduces delays, lowers costs for mining companies, and encourages private sector investment in domestic projects, reducing dependence on foreign-controlled supply chains. It also enhances the efficiency and predictability of regulatory reviews, enabling companies to plan and execute projects more effectively while maintaining environmental and community safeguards. By balancing environmental, social, and governance concerns with expedited approvals, a reformed permitting process supports a resilient and competitive critical minerals industry, bolsters economic growth, and ensures that the United States can secure a stable supply of these essential materials for its energy transition and technological needs. The authors in this book have suggested the following concrete initiatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should increase funding for agencies to hire more mineral experts, enabling timely National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews by improving early engagement with mine project applicants and reducing delays caused by insufficiently detailed mine plans. Congress should also allocate additional funding to defray mine applicants’ permitting costs, including support for hiring approved, high-quality contractors to streamline the NEPA process and reduce compliance burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new administration should direct the Permitting Council to use its voting authority to include more mining projects under FAST-41, bypassing the $200 million investment threshold for projects extracting critical energy transition minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new administration’s Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) should issue a rule establishing clear thresholds for “intensity” factors in the NEPA process, enabling agencies to determine when an environmental impact assessment (EIS) is sufficient and avoiding unnecessary environmental impact statement preparation. Increasing the use of programmatic environmental reviews and categorical exclusions would streamline permitting for critical minerals projects by pre-evaluating broad categories of activities, reducing redundancy in individual project assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress could pass legislation categorically exempting mines producing primary energy transition minerals from NEPA’s environmental assessment and EIS requirements, expediting permitting timelines while specifying covered minerals from the Department of Energy’s critical energy materials list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-pursue-strategic-international-engagement&quot;&gt;9. Pursue strategic international engagement.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will need to take a page out of China’s playbook if it is to meaningfully compete. Over the past 30 years, China has leveraged its foreign policy to establish a dominant position in global critical minerals markets. Although it produces only 10 percent of the world’s lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper, China has made strategic investments globally and imports enough to process 65 to 90 percent of the global supply of these metals at home. The United States will need to collaborate with historical allies—like Australia, Canada, and the European Union—in addition to Global South countries. This will require a judicious balance of sticks and carrots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The administration should prioritize stable tariff policies and minimize tariffs with allied nations to maintain investor confidence and minimize potential supply chain disruptions. It should balance tariffs and restrictions on Chinese products to address market manipulation, unfair practices, carbon intensity, and human rights without applying a blanket exclusion on Chinese firms, given that non-Chinese supply chains for a number of commodities are currently underdeveloped or undeveloped.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government can align its diplomacy efforts with its financing mechanisms—for example, priority financial support can be given to partners and forum members in the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP). It can also reform existing financing instruments to enable greater flexibility to fund supply chain diversification projects. For example, the 2025 reauthorization of the DFC provides an opportunity for the institution to go beyond its current mandate and finance mining projects in high-income allied countries like Canada and Chile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should utilize technical assistance. This includes supporting the geological mapping of resource-rich countries, which can de-risk investments for exploration companies seeking to invest in emerging economies. This is vital because over 99 percent of exploration projects are unsuccessful. This effort also includes investing in infrastructure. The mining industry is highly energy and water intensive and requires rail and port infrastructure to be exported. China has gained a significant upper hand through infrastructure investment in resource-rich developing countries. During the first 10 years of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), it invested $1 trillion. These investments have allowed China to secure raw materials for domestic processing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-strengthen-the-defense-industrial-base&quot;&gt;10. Strengthen the defense industrial base.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is rapidly expanding its investments in munitions and acquiring advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States. While China operates with a wartime mindset to enhance its military readiness, the United States maintains a peacetime approach. Even before the implementation of new restrictions, the U.S. defense industrial base struggled with insufficient capacity and limited surge capabilities to meet production demands for defense technologies. Restrictions on critical mineral inputs will only exacerbate this gap, enabling China to further outpace the United States in developing these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Joint Staff should develop a war-planning scenario aligned with DOD policy and National Defense Strategy objectives. This updated scenario would enable the generation of more realistic estimates for defense-related critical minerals requirements, ensuring adequate preparedness for future conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD should stabilize funding for critical minerals in the base budget to ensure predictability for industry and investment planning, moving beyond reliance on one-off supplemental appropriations by utilizing mechanisms like discrete program increases or functional transfers within industrial mobilization programs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD should streamline critical minerals sourcing rules by conducting an acquisition reform study to identify and consolidate overlapping regulations, simplifying exception structures. It should also develop a legislative proposal to reduce compliance burdens while supporting sub-tier supplier validation and military specification development. Furthermore, delegating authority for approving Presidential Determinations to the secretary of defense would significantly shorten the timeline for industrial base investments while ensuring informed decisions on critical minerals shortfalls with input from relevant departments and agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MRMoqIg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（7日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第130日審訊，黎智英第38日作供，控方繼續盤問黎，談及黎對國際線的認知。黎早前供稱未聽聞過「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（簡稱 IPAC），惟控方展示訊息紀錄，裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）在2020年5月底告知黎 IPAC 將會成立，又傳送相關新聞稿和網站，並一度問黎能否保留頭版。黎其後傳送時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏的聯絡方法給裴倫德，著對方將照片傳送給陳沛敏。《蘋果》最終在6月5日刊登報導。控方質疑黎聲稱「不在乎」IPAC 的說法。法官李素蘭問，所以黎當時不知道 IPAC 是關於什麼，但是同意刊登它？黎同意。另外，控方反覆追問，黎在《國安法》之後仍然支持「光時」嗎？黎多次表明不會回答。控方最終指出，黎在《國安法》之後支持「光時」。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎供稱未曾聽聞日本線和李字軒&quot;&gt;黎供稱未曾聽聞「日本線」和李字軒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問，圍繞黎與同案被告陳梓華和被指為本案「共謀者」之一的「攬炒巴」劉祖廸之間的關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，在2020年1月11日台北陽明山別墅會議之後，黎曾與陳梓華有對話。黎稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華早前供稱，在會議翌日晚上，他與劉祖廸跟李宇軒進行線上會議，其後將會議內容告知黎。陳告訴黎：「Andy（李宇軒）同劉祖廸都同意喺國際線上面跟隨你嘅行動。」而李宇軒會「打國際線」，黎卻認為李宇軒和劉祖廸都應該要一同「打國際線」。至2020年1月底，陳再次聯絡黎，告知他：「『攬炒』（劉祖廸）唔想打議會線，但係喺國際線上面，就會全力開火。」陳另向黎提及「當時有條日本線，就係李宇軒打嘅」，惟當時很難接觸到「枱底人」，黎則叫陳等人聯絡其私人助手 Mark Simon，以協助美國線。陳引述黎提醒他們：「叫我哋唔好咁心急，因為係一個 long game（持久戰）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指向黎指出上述案情，黎一概否認，指陳梓華編造出來，又重申他從沒聽聞李字軒，直至在庭上才聽到。黎又稱未曾聽聞「日本線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎未有提醒陳梓華對國安法謹慎&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎未有提醒陳梓華對《國安法》謹慎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月21日，黎智英向陳梓華傳送人大公布實施「港版國安法」的報導，並說：「仆街打到嚟喇！」陳回覆黎：「黎前輩：事情至今，已經難以逆轉形勢，我唯一擔心是你與 Martin 及你們家人的自身安全，萬事請以自身安全與事業存續為首要考慮。國安法主要針對境外內勇武人士，港獨份子及煽惑群眾人士。你務必謹慎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後回覆陳：「我們不要擔心個人安危。一旦站出來爭取自由，便要準備作戰至最後一刻，我們雖然未必會勝利，但必須堅持下去。不用擔心。更好的日子即將來臨。」（“Let’s not worry about personal security. Once came out to join the fight for freedom one is prepared to fight to the last. We may not win but must persist. Don’t worry. Better days will come.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在盤問下，黎否認訊息意思是叫陳「堅持（persist）」，只是說安慰的說話，叫他不要擔心個人安危。惟控方指黎說「必須堅持下去」。黎則稱是泛指所有香港人，「準備作戰至最後一刻，我們雖然未必會勝利，但必須堅持下去。」控方問黎所以他叫陳「準備作戰至最後一刻」？黎同意。控方又問，黎也會「準備作戰至最後一刻」？黎亦同意，不過他否認籲陳繼續作戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎在早前供稱一直提醒身邊的人謹慎，避免觸犯《國安法》，然而他未有在訊息中提醒陳對《國安法》謹慎。黎則稱當時的討論話題是安慰及鼓勵陳，不容他作出提醒。他同意未有作出提醒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到「作戰」是什麼意思，黎指是「一直進行的那種反抗」。控方問即是「反政府運動」？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華曾傳送攬炒團隊眾籌連結-控方質疑黎聲稱從沒聽聞攬炒團隊說法&quot;&gt;陳梓華曾傳送攬炒團隊眾籌連結 控方質疑黎聲稱從沒聽聞「攬炒團隊」說法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月28日，陳梓華向黎智英傳送「連登」討論區連結，題為〈【突發】攬炒過後是晨曦！攬炒團隊《重光香港計劃》眾籌上線！〉。黎則稱未曾按進去連結查看，因為對此不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎早前供稱從沒聽聞「攬炒團隊」，可是從這個訊息表面看來，黎有看過「攬炒團隊」，因此黎的證供是不真實。黎否認不真實，只是當時未留意這是「攬炒團隊」。控方指出，黎其實是知道「攬炒團隊」。黎說：「你可以這樣說，但這不是真實的」，其後表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，眾籌網站提及：「2020年5月，國安法兵臨城下，但我地香港人已經準備好攬炒。天助自助者，琴晚國務卿 Pompeo 亦措辭強硬，直言香港自治已死，全面制裁即將降臨。」黎稱沒有留意到網站是關於推動進一步制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再度展示2020年6月15日《蘋果》的「隔牆有耳」欄目，題為〈中共威脅全球民主自由 攬炒巴加入國際聯軍反抗〉，問黎當時是否知道「攬炒巴」劉祖廸參與國際游說。黎則稱可能只曾「瞥一眼」報導，因版面有太多相片，但強調未有留意標題上的「攬炒巴」。他稱平日也不會閱讀「隔牆有耳」欄目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認籲陳梓華及其他人繼續在文宣和國際線上工作&quot;&gt;黎否認籲陳梓華及其他人繼續在文宣和國際線上工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及2020年6月16日，黎與陳梓華在壹傳媒大樓見面。陳早前供稱，他在會上說：「我認為應該要褪（讓步）」，黎當時回應《國安法》「雷聲大雨點小」。黎同意說過《國安法》「雷聲大雨點小」，因當時認為中共不會摧毁香港，但他稱沒有聽過陳說要讓步。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，黎稱：「會以身作則，會繼續喺唔同嘅媒體上面呼籲制裁同埋關注。」陳引述黎籲陳「都應該係咁」，又籲他叫其他人繼續在文宣和國際線上工作。當控方今日覆述陳的證供時，黎表示：「我完全不同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指：「再一次，你沒有提醒陳謹慎，是否同意？」黎說：「我沒有提醒他，因為大家都知道《國安法》來臨。」控方問，該次會面之後，黎有否提醒陳？黎則稱：「他是成年人，他知道應該怎樣做，我不是他的父親，你為什麼問這個問題呢？」控方追問，所以黎的答案是沒有？黎同意沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不知對華政策跨國議會聯盟簡稱是ipac&quot;&gt;黎稱不知「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」簡稱是「IPAC」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方談及「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC），並引述陳梓華的證供，在6月16日的會面中，黎問陳為何不加入 IPAC，因黎覺得「IPAC 好重要，一定要有呢啲國際支持，先會有用。」黎否認說過，重申陳編造故事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示訊息，「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）在2020年5月31日說：「Hi, Jimmy. My friend Luke de Pulford would like to be in touch with you regarding a new Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China which he is setting up. I am also involved in it as an advisor. May I give him your number?」黎回覆：「Of course. Thank you.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎的證供是他直至當天從未聽聞 IPAC？黎起初確認他獲告知，但是未有留意，因為他不感興趣；其後在追問下，黎稱他只見到「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」的全名，但是未有把它與其簡稱「IPAC」視為一樣，即使見到全名也未有看重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;裴倫德透過訊息傳送ipac資料給黎-控方質疑黎並非不在乎&quot;&gt;裴倫德透過訊息傳送IPAC資料給黎 控方質疑黎並非「不在乎」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示訊息，裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）於2020年5月31日問黎：「Can you speak now?」，黎回覆：「I call you now.」控方問二人最終有否通話？黎起初稱不記得，但其後稱他承諾過別人的話理應是有通話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月1日，裴倫德向黎傳送文件「IPAC Briefing 31 May」，並說：「There’s more information here www.ipac.global but the site is under construction so please don’t share yet.」、「Will send a press release tomorrow」，黎回覆「Ok. Thanks. Jimmy」。控方指，裴倫德傳送的網站標題為〈IPAC: Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China〉，因此黎是知道「IPAC」等同於「Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China」。黎稱當時沒有留意，又稱不在乎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭質疑，若然黎不在乎的話，為何不向羅傑斯說「不要把我的電話號碼交給裴倫德，我不在乎這個對華政策跨國議會聯盟」？黎則稱：「我不會表現到如此無禮。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎並非「不在乎」，當裴倫德聯絡黎的時候，黎表示「I call you now.」。黎則回應，這是出於禮貌回覆，並一度說「我甚至不認識裴倫德。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭追問：「你會打電話給你不認識的人嗎？」黎則稱，因為羅傑斯給了他的電話號碼給裴倫德，而裴倫德問可否談話，所以他便回覆「現在打給你」，重申只是出於禮貌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新聞稿顯示ipac為了一致地回應中國崛起&quot;&gt;新聞稿顯示IPAC為了一致地回應中國崛起&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示裴倫德傳來的 IPAC 資料，顯示 IPAC 是由世界各地的議員組成，為了一致地回應由中共統治的中國崛起，對民主國家帶來的挑戰。（“Developing a coherent response to the rise of the People’s Republic of China as led by the Chinese Communist Party is a defining challenge for the world’s democratic states.”）控方問這是否與黎一直以來所提倡的觀點一致？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示 IPAC 共同創辦人名單，當中包括日本眾議員菅野志櫻里（Shiori Yamao）、英國國會議員施志安（Iain Duncan Smith）和時任美國共和黨參議員盧比奧（Marco Rubio）。黎稱從沒聽聞菅野志櫻里，但肯定有聽聞盧比奧，施志安則不記得在哪裡聽聞過，可能是在庭上。黎其後指，從沒想過日本人也有參與，對此感到意外。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示裴倫德與黎談及頭版事宜-黎同意替ipac宣傳&quot;&gt;訊息顯示裴倫德與黎談及頭版事宜 黎同意替IPAC宣傳&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月1日，裴倫德向黎傳送訊息：「Jimmy, we may have to delay launch because of what’s happening in the US. Prob Sunday or Monday.」黎回覆「Ok, thanks. Jimmy」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，裴倫德再傳訊息：「Launch confirmed for Monday 8th 08:00am Hong Kong time. Do you release your front page the previous evening? If not, you could have it for Monday’s paper…」黎回覆：「I don’t know about front page but will try to put it in prominent place if front page is not available. Thanks, Jimmy」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問裴倫德想黎將什麼放在頭版？黎稱不知道，因他讓員工自行決定放什麼在頭版，而他當時只是禮貌回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示訊息，2020年6月3日裴倫德告訴黎，IPAC 將會在星期五（即6月5日）成立，又指「如果他們打算報導包括我，請讓我提供新照片——《蘋果日報》的照片很差。（“If they want to include me in the story please let me give new photos - Apple Daily ones are bad.”）」。黎其後傳送時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏的聯絡方法給裴倫德，著對方將照片傳送給陳沛敏。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指由此可見，黎於2020年6月3日已知道 IPAC 將會正式成立，而黎同意替 IPAC 宣傳，所以他才會傳送陳沛敏的聯絡方式給裴倫德。黎同意。法官李素蘭問，所以黎當時不知道 IPAC 是關於什麼，但是同意刊登它？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認給予編採指示叫陳沛敏報導ipac成立&quot;&gt;黎否認給予編採指示叫陳沛敏報導IPAC成立&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指另一邊廂，黎有傳送訊息給陳沛敏，提醒她直至星期五之前都不要刊登報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，有關 IPAC 成立的報導最終有刊出，並展示2020年6月5日的《蘋果》報導〈斥強推港版國安法踐踏人權 9議會結盟強硬抗中共〉。控方指，黎傳送給陳沛敏的訊息，其實是一個編採指示，叫她刊登新聞報導。黎否認，並指他只是轉發手頭上的資訊給陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，裴倫德向黎傳送訊息：「Thanks for all your support Jimmy. Thinking of you daily.」，黎回覆：「Thank you so much! Sorry that we couldn’t make your news our front page because it coincides with June 4th reporting.」，黎又感謝對方的理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎拒答國安法後是否支持光復香港-時代革命&quot;&gt;黎拒答國安法後是否支持「光復香港 時代革命」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指 IPAC 報導被編排在報紙 A12 頁，又提到報紙上方的橫條寫有「惡法臨城」，旁邊含有「光復香港 時代革命」口號照片，問黎是否留意到。黎稱它屬於裝飾，經常出現在版面上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否支持這句口號？黎表示這不是他要思考的問題，過去很多人叫喊這句口號。控方追問，所以黎支持這句口號？黎稱未有想過。法官杜麗冰問：「你是否反對它？」黎稱沒有思考過，但是他不認為他會反對一些放在其報紙上的東西。控方繼續追問黎是否支持「光時」。黎重申沒有思考過，但是如果他的報紙刊登過，他理應是支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後反覆追問，國安法之後，黎仍然支持「光時」嗎？黎多次表明不會回答，因這是假設性的問題，又指庭上展示的報紙是《國安法》之前。控方最終向黎指出，他在《國安法》之後支持「光時」。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎冀國際阻止國安法實施-卻聲稱不知ipac&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎冀國際阻止國安法實施 卻聲稱不知IPAC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官李運騰提問下，黎承認在2020年6月的時候，他仍然希望香港有國際支持，而報導所指「9議會結盟強硬抗中共」，屬於他希望得到的支持。控方則質疑，黎希望國際支持，但是卻聲稱不留意 IPAC？黎堅稱未有留意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎曾在公開訪談中要求制裁官員，又在2020年5月底計劃赴美國會見彭斯及議員，黎希望國際社會能夠阻止國安法實施，而 IPAC 正正符合黎的想法，也是黎想要的東西，因此黎必然會留意。黎堅稱未有留意到 IPAC，「無論你問我多少次，我的回答也是相同。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，所有羅傑斯和裴倫德傳送給黎的東西，黎都不感興趣？黎指二人傳送東西給他，只是想透過他來刊登在《蘋果》。控方追問，這些訊息是關乎人權，是黎一直以來提倡的東西，不會引起黎的興趣嗎？黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎三度說謊-黎否認並稱知道ipac並非罪行&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎三度說謊 黎否認並稱知道IPAC並非罪行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月13日，裴倫德在訊息中感謝黎轉發 IPAC 的帖文。黎則稱該帖文是其「徒弟」李兆富撰寫，而他可能只曾「瞥一眼」。法官杜麗冰指，黎早前供稱直至在庭上才聽聞 IPAC，然而，「這則有關 IPAC 的帖文擺在你面前，你會否同意你早前告訴法庭的證供是不準確？」黎否認不準確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎向法庭說謊。黎否認。控方續指：「有關 IPAC 的事情，你三度向法庭說謊。」黎再否認，反稱自己沒有理由說謊，又指知道 IPAC 並非罪行，「這不是一件大事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至7月7日，裴倫德向黎傳送 Twitter 帖文的連結，載有英國國會議員施志安的發言影片，談及中國打壓香港及新疆維吾爾族人，提及制裁林鄭及取消官員的外國護照等。黎則稱他未看過影片，堅稱不知道施志安呼籲制裁林鄭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（2月10日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;
