  &lt;li&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英信國際壓力有效 國安法後繼續對談節目 惟同事擔心有問題&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;黎智英曾提議準備「Shit list」 惟陳沛敏指很難於新聞建議制裁對象&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（22日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第31日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。她供稱《國安法》生效之後，黎智英繼續舉辦 Live Chat 節目，所有獲邀的嘉賓都是外國人，因此她理解黎依然抱持國際壓力有效的想法。陳又提到「我哋嗰時都有少少驚訝」，同事擔心黎的節目內容觸犯《國安法》，亦有其他傳媒提出質疑。就此，《蘋果》同事曾經徵詢律師意見，時任社長張劍虹曾向黎反映同事擔憂，惟以她所見，黎繼續進行對談節目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果列賣港罪人逐個數-陳沛敏確認反映黎智英對國安法觀點&quot;&gt;《蘋果》列「賣港罪人逐個數」 陳沛敏確認反映黎智英對《國安法》觀點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第十天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨日展示《國安法》生效當日，即2020年7月1日的《蘋果日報》頭版〈惡法生效 兩制蓋棺 泛民7.1繼續抗爭〉，今繼續展示報紙內頁報導「撐惡法葬送自治 賣港罪人逐個數」，橫跨兩頁，列出不同政治人物的姓名、職位和頭像。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指版面上方有「歷史紀錄」四字，陳指是紀錄《國安法》立法及生效過程。控方逐一展示版面中「賣港罪人」的不同類別，包括「港區人大㩒掣」、「左派打手發功」、「政協旗手宣傳」、「行會成員護航」、「政府官員獻媚」、「立法會應聲蟲」、「建制派發言力谷」、「紀律部隊表忠」和「大學校長跪低」。前特首梁振英、董建華、時任政務司司長張建宗、財政司司長陳茂波和時任警務處處長鄧炳強等人榜上有名。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問這版面顯示的一幅政治漫畫，以及列出不同人物的姓名和頭像，目的是什麼？陳指是想紀錄在《國安法》醞釀、通過立法到生效的過程中，這些機構和人物的角色是什麼，以及曾經表態，對象是香港的讀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問這版面是否與黎智英對於《國安法》的觀點有關？陳表示：「呢個都係反映咗佢（黎）對呢件事嘅睇法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏提議群組轉移至signal-因有訊息銷毀功能-而whatsapp不足以保障通訊私隱&quot;&gt;陳沛敏提議群組轉移至Signal 因有訊息銷毀功能 而WhatsApp不足以保障通訊私隱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，WhatsApp 群組「國安法應變委員會」於2020年7月1日設立，訊息紀錄顯示陳沛敏曾提出轉移至另一通訊軟件 Signal 討論。陳解釋有兩個原因，在該段時期有人提出質疑 WhatsApp 的功能不足以保障通訊私隱，因此有很多人轉用其他通訊軟件，包括 Signal 或 Telegram；另外，Signal 有一項功能，用戶可以設定訊息在某個時間消失。由於當時「國安法應變委員會」群組主要討論《國安法》，而「傳媒機構當時話唔知紅線係點樣劃」，所以簡單的方法是設定訊息消失功能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示群組截圖，顯示「羅偉光已將訊息銷毀時間設為6小時」，下方則是「盧峯已將訊息銷毀時間設為1小時」。法官李運騰問，是否所有群組成員都可以設定訊息銷毀時間。陳表示，記憶中各個成員都可以設定，「但我有超過兩年半冇用過通訊軟件」，所以這只是她的記憶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李兆富不再替黎智英管理twitter帳戶-陳沛敏稱不清楚原因&quot;&gt;李兆富不再替黎智英管理Twitter帳戶 陳沛敏稱不清楚原因&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年7月3日的訊息紀錄，黎智英向陳沛敏稱：「Simon Lee（李兆富）已通知我不能再為我處理 Twitter，請你幫忙盡量每天給我些料上 Twitter. Thanks. Jimmy」，並問陳為何李兆富不能替黎處理 Twitter。陳表示當時不太清楚。控方又問陳，黎傳送上述訊息之後，李還有沒有繼續管理黎的 Twitter 帳戶。陳則稱：「咁我唔知佢管理係直至邊一日。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示羅偉光於2020年7月4日傳送給黎智英的一幅文章截圖：「惡法臨城，喺《蘋果》寫專欄15年嘅利世民（李兆富）決定封筆，肥佬黎話，睇到 Simon 封筆，唔好意思要 Simon 再處理佢個 Twitter 嘅事，雖然 po 文係肥佬黎畀
Simon 嘅，但都唔想連累 Simon 受無妄之災。國安震懾之下找個人處理 Twitter 都難，肥佬黎都幾大鑊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳對上述內容有否記憶，陳表示「唔記得」。控方又問陳是否記得最後一次見到李兆富是何時，陳亦表示「唔記得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏國安法生效後-張劍虹曾提醒報導提及制裁要小心&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：國安法生效後 張劍虹曾提醒報導提及「制裁」要小心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年7月4日的《蘋果》報紙，其中一頁上方寫「一周熱話」，陳指逢星期六論壇版可能圍繞某個主題而設，由主理論壇版的楊清奇籌備。當日主題為「國際棋盤上的香港」，控方問為何挑選這主題，陳則指楊當時沒有解釋原因，「佢淨係話呢個禮拜會用制裁呢個 topic。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到《蘋果》有否在其他欄目使用「制裁」這個主題，陳指黎智英曾經在其專欄「成敗樂一笑」提及這主題。至於《蘋果》對於「制裁」的角度，陳指當外國政府或國會就制裁有新進展，《蘋果》便會報導。她又提到，《國安法》生效之後，「張生（張劍虹）有提及過，做呢啲制裁報導要小心呀。」陳指作為新聞報導，他們只是陳述「有件咁嘅事」，但是評論就是另外一回事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏觀察蘋果評論版傾向揀選對制裁有正面取向或討論制裁效用的作者&quot;&gt;陳沛敏觀察《蘋果》評論版傾向揀選「對制裁有正面取向」或討論制裁效用的作者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰追問，那《蘋果》揀選評論文章作者時，會選擇支持制裁還是反對制裁的作者，他們的角度又是怎樣？陳表示她並沒有參與揀選寫手，但是按她自己的觀察而言，「我會覺得佢係傾向多啲係對制裁有正面取向，或者討論吓佢有冇用呀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官問誰人負責揀選作者。陳指《蘋果》社論作者顏純鈎就是由黎智英推薦，並透過張劍虹去聯絡，張有時亦會通知她有新的社論寫手。論壇版作者則是由楊清奇挑選，「我就極少建議寫手」，雖然「我都建議過（寫手），但嗰啲都唔係寫制裁嘅寫手囉」，例如她曾向張劍虹推薦過一個前《有線新聞》記者，因該記者熟悉政策和議會。惟「國際棋盤上的香港」中的3篇文章作者，均不是由她推薦的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰留意到，版面下方有一張遊行相片，有人手持標語「林鄭離晒譜，唔要人工，燒$人工島」，問陳這標語是否反映《蘋果》的立場？陳則指這是由設計部設計的，他們將主題相關的相片拼湊，並放在版面上方和下方，行內俗稱「報眉」和「報腳」，並會給楊清奇或負責的編輯過目，「我諗相和版面主題要係相關，未必係一種立場嘅表示，但一定係要有相關性囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏國安法生效後黎智英繼續邀外國嘉賓出席對談節目-抱持國際壓力有效想法&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：《國安法》生效後黎智英繼續邀外國嘉賓出席對談節目 抱持國際壓力有效想法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月14日，特朗普正式簽署《香港自治法》（Hong Kong Autonomy Act）生效，法案授權美國政府制裁有份損害香港自治權的中國及香港官員。7月15日，黎智英向陳沛敏傳送時任美國總統特朗普所簽署的行政命令內文，以及相關白宮網站連結。陳確認，但她稱不記得之後二人有再就此討論，因為黎告知她此消息的同時，報館也收到這消息。不過陳補充，黎特意通知她這消息，「我會理解為佢都好重視呢個新聞囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎有否在其他場合談及這項新聞，陳指黎在其個人專欄、替外國媒體撰文，或者在「飯盒會」裡有談及，她理解黎覺得這些措施是美國對中央政府施加壓力，在《國安法》生效之前，是希望阻止《國安法》生效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過在《國安法》生效之後，陳記得黎有繼續舉辦 Live Chat 節目，所有獲邀嘉賓都是外國人，「所以我嘅理解係，佢係希望透過國際壓力、國際關注，即使喺《國安法》生效之後，佢亦都抱持著呢樣嘢係有效，啫係國際壓力。」控方追問「國際壓力」是包括什麼，陳說：「我諗係包括制裁囉。」控方又問黎談論這些事時，會使用什麼字眼，陳表示不記得具體字眼，或許黎覺得「《國安法》比佢原本想像更加大鑊？⋯⋯所以佢都好緊張」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏同事擔心黎對談節目內容觸犯國安法-惟黎繼續&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：同事擔心黎對談節目內容觸犯國安法 惟黎繼續&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏表示，「我哋嗰時都有少少驚訝」，因為黎繼續製作 Live Chat 節目，當時有些同事嘗試徵詢律師意見，惟控方打斷指法庭不需要知道相關法律意見內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續表示，總之同事之間都擔心黎的 Live Chat 節目內容在國安法之下會否有問題，此外亦有其他傳媒質疑黎的節目內容會否違反《國安法》，「咁我都有去問張生（張劍虹），需唔需要向黎生提出呢個問題」，後來她得知張亦曾經向黎反映同事的擔心和憂慮，「但我見黎生都有繼續做呢個節目。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，黎有否向陳提及制裁的對象，陳表示：「我理解係港府官員，其他我唔記得。」她亦記得對象是多於一個官員，「但佢（黎）冇好具體咁講過邊個名、邊個名、邊個名。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/04SSpAo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（22日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第31日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。她憶述時任美國總統特朗普簽署《香港自治法》的行政命令之後，黎智英提出準備一份「Shit List」，她理解黎的意思是「制裁名單」，不過她與同事商討之後，認為很難在新聞中建議一些被制裁對象，所以最終未有落實黎的提議，而只是報導行政命令對香港的影響，當中包括制裁官員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;美國香港自治法生效後-黎智英曾提議製作shit-list&quot;&gt;美國《香港自治法》生效後 黎智英曾提議製作「Shit List」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第十天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上午審訊提及2020年7月14日，特朗普正式簽署《香港自治法》（Hong Kong Autonomy Act），法案授權美國政府制裁有份損害香港自治權的中國及香港官員。黎智英其後以 WhatsApp 向陳沛敏傳送時任美國總統特朗普所簽署的行政命令內文，以及相關白宮網站連結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，根據陳於2022年11月9日錄取的口供，她與黎曾談論相關事件，並向陳出示該口供紀錄。陳庭上閱畢後，澄清二人並非「額外溝通」，而是文字上的溝通。她記得黎當時以英文提出：「你哋不如整個 Shit List 嘅嘢，但我嗰時唔係好理解 Shit List 係點解」，不過根據訊息前文後理，她理解黎的意思是要製作「制裁名單」。控方遂展示訊息紀錄，黎稱：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I’d say we should work up a shit list on those involved in censorship, which can include intimidation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏稱，收到黎的訊息之後，她曾跟同事討論能否做到一個制裁名單，可是其後發現「好難喺個新聞度做到呢樣嘢囉。」她續指，黎的提議最終並沒有做到，「只係（報導）講吓呢個行政命令對香港嘅影響，咁當然包括制裁一啲官員。不過由報紙去建議一啲人（制裁對象）出嚟，咁好難喺新聞做到呢樣嘢囉。」她不肯定此後二人還有否談論過「Shit List」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月16日，《蘋果》頭版報導〈「自由被剝奪 跟大陸無異」 特朗普撤港特殊地位〉。控方續展示黎智英在翌日的 Twitter 帖文，與頭版新聞相關：「#HongKong #SafeHarborAct and #PeoplesFreedomandChoiceAct are good wherewithals to our resistance movement. Salute all former CGs and State Dept staff for caring about this place we call home.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;飯盒會紀錄指國安法紅線模糊按自己良知新聞原則去做&quot;&gt;飯盒會紀錄指「國安法紅線模糊，按自己良知、新聞原則去做」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹和陳沛敏之間的訊息紀錄，顯示陳於2020年7月17日向張傳送「今日飯盒會討論重點」。陳表示該次「飯盒會」由她記錄重點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中第二點，指「字眼可作斟酌，國安法紅線模糊，按自己良知、新聞原則去做」。陳確認會議上曾談論這點，因為《國安法》生效之後，她及其他同事對於哪些題材或字眼犯法，以及做法是否在新聞自由和言論自由的範圍之內，「我哋自己都仲係摸索階段，但每日都仲需要出新聞㗎嘛，所以我哋提出討論。」她指寫得在會議紀錄上的重點，「至少黎生都係同意呢個結論囉」，不過該次會議上未有討論到具體做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;會議紀錄第三點指「多約海外作者」，控方問陳會否記得為何有這討論。陳指「因為係黎生建議囉」，因當時有很多海外媒體和評論都關注香港在《國安法》生效之後的情況，「所以黎生覺得多啲呢啲人嘅意見出現喺《蘋果日報》係需要㗎囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑報導只在最後一段提及建制派觀點-惟未提供全文英文翻譯&quot;&gt;控方質疑報導只在最後一段提及建制派觀點 惟未提供全文英文翻譯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月18日《蘋果》頭版報導為〈美制裁名單 韓正林鄭PK鄧上榜〉，當中引述《彭博新聞社》指特朗普團隊已有制裁名單，包括中共中央政治局常委韓正、時任特首林鄭月娥和時任警務處長鄧炳強，不過當時制裁名單尚未公開。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Vxafj1x.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，報導最後一段的副標題為「建制派斥 『石頭掟自己腳』」，當中有提及建制派的看法，除此之外，整篇頭版報導便沒有提及建制派。惟控方並未有將整篇報導翻譯成英文，只翻譯了首段和標題。不懂閱讀中文的法官李素蘭投訴指不知道控方在談論什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰則指，整篇文章總共有六個段落，然而提及建制派的內容已佔了其中一段，雖然是否屬「平衡報道」是另一回事，但至少報導中有包括建制派的觀點。法官杜麗冰表示，較恰當的做法是先翻譯整篇報導，稍後才就此文章提問。控方表示會安排翻譯，稍後時間會回歸此議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果頭版報導美籲自由世界戰勝新暴政-陳沛敏確認與黎觀點有關&quot;&gt;蘋果頭版報導「美籲自由世界戰勝新暴政」 陳沛敏確認與黎觀點有關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年7月25日的《蘋果》頭版，標題為〈蓬佩奧尼克遜館宣告 50年對華政策失敗 美籲自由世界戰勝新暴政〉，副題為「北京轟冷戰思維 政治謊言」。陳形容，時任美國國務卿使用「自由世界要戰勝新暴政」如此強烈的字眼，在國際外交和中美關係上都是重要的姿態，所以決定以此報導作為頭版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問這頭版與黎智英的觀點是否有關。陳確認，「因為黎生都係比較重視美國嘅睇法，同埋對中共比較批判，所以我哋覺得呢個新聞係緊要囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果頭版報導朱牧民等6人被通緝-陳沛敏朱應是美國公民-對被通緝感荒謬&quot;&gt;蘋果頭版報導朱牧民等6人被通緝 陳沛敏：朱應是美國公民 對被通緝感荒謬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月2日《蘋果日報》頭版標題為〈國安惡法全球橫行 美籍朱牧民：游說自己國家也被通緝〉。英文譯本將標題譯為「American Nationality Samuel Chu, He is wanted for lobbying his own country.」，惟陳則認為譯做「I am wanted for lobbying my own country」會較好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指 Mark Simon 較早前把朱牧民的聯絡電話傳送給陳沛敏，問上述報導是否與 Mark Simon 的訊息有關。陳則指不相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，頭版包含一個列表，顯示六名人士涉嫌干犯《國安法》罪名而被通緝，包括香港民主委員會前總監朱牧民、前本土民主前線召集人黃台仰、英國駐港總領事館前職員鄭文傑、前學生獨立聯盟召集人陳家駒、前香港眾志創黨主席羅冠聰和「香港效益主義黨」主席劉康。陳確認，並指這六人被指違反《國安法》，「同埋似乎都唔喺香港。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於文章內容，陳指朱牧民曾提及自小便離關香港，而且應該是美國公民，「所以佢覺得自己被通緝好荒謬」，因他口中的「自己國家」就是美國，「啫係佢覺得，話佢勾結外國勢力危害國家安全，就好荒謬囉呢件事。」控方追問，朱游說美國去做什麼？陳回答是制裁香港和中國政府官員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示黎智英同日的 Twitter 帖文，附有上述報導的連結，並稱：「6 activists are wanted mostly for what they did before imposition of #NationalSecurityLaw . It implies the law is retrospective and anyone ever criticized CCP be aware if you come to HK again. Can this be good for business?」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;美國宣布制裁11名官員後-黎智英twitter提及選舉主任應為dq負責&quot;&gt;美國宣布制裁11名官員後 黎智英Twitter提及選舉主任應為DQ負責&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年8月8日的《蘋果》頭版，題為〈美斥打壓民主 制裁林鄭鄧炳強11官〉，並問到，為何版面下方會加插特朗普的相片。陳指，因為法案是由特朗普簽署，而制裁是簽署法案之後引申出來的行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示黎智英於8月8日發布的 Twitter 帖文：「How about those election officers (選舉主任) who disqualified #DQ the candidate nominations ? Should they be personally responsible for making the decisions?」，並附有上述報導連結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，記憶中黎沒有跟她談及對此事情的看法，不過她指報導中的選舉最後沒有舉行。她知道當時有人被DQ，因「如果有人被取消提名，一定會做新聞㗎嘛」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英傳送新聞稿-籲自行決定-惟陳沛敏視之為指示&quot;&gt;黎智英傳送新聞稿 籲「自行決定」 惟陳沛敏：視之為指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月10日，黎智英向陳沛敏發送一份英文新聞稿，當中提及「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」執行總監裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）和前立法會議員羅冠聰，正準備在英國以私人檢控形式起訴英籍香港警察「酷刑罪」。黎並向陳稱：「請自行決定。（Please decide yourself.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過陳表示，她理解黎的訊息是「指示」，因為相關人士可以直接傳送新聞稿給她，「咁佢哋又要透過黎生，咁我會視之為一個指示。」她收到黎的訊息後，便叫同事根據新聞稿內容寫成一篇報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示《蘋果》報導，題為〈國際團隊眾籌控英籍港警〉，文章有提及裴倫德和羅冠聰。陳確認這篇報導基本上是按照黎傳來的新聞稿而撰寫，但同事亦有加上一些背景資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑報導加插眾籌網址-是為了便利讀者接觸&quot;&gt;官質疑報導加插眾籌網址 是為了便利讀者接觸&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰留意到文章中加插了眾籌網址，問陳為何記者會加上，以及為何有需要。陳指，因為通常報導發布之後，有讀者會透過電郵或電話來詢問如何找到相關眾籌網站，他們相信讀者對報導中的眾籌有興趣，所以同事會將網址加入報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官質疑，新聞稿提供前《蘋果》專欄作家 Jack Hazlewood 的聯絡方法，為何卻不在報導中提供，而是提供眾籌網址？陳則指：「因為眾籌網站一 click 就可以去到。」李官指，因此在報導中加入眾籌網址的做法，是要便利讀者接觸眾籌網站。陳則回應，因為 Jack Hazlewood 的聯絡方式並不是給記者作報導用途，而是讓記者有需要時可以聯絡他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英被捕翌日報紙頭版蘋果一定撐落去&quot;&gt;黎智英被捕翌日報紙頭版「蘋果一定撐落去」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎智英於2020年8月10日被拘捕，《蘋果》翌日頭版標題為〈200警搜壹傳媒 拘黎智英 「蘋果一定撐落去」〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cx0Fl7q.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問「蘋果一定撐落去」是否黎的言論，陳則指張劍虹都有講過此說話。控方遂指報導首段提到：「壹傳媒行政總裁、《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹就表示：『蘋果一定可以撐落去！』」陳確認。控方又特別指出報導其中一句：「對於警方翻天覆地搜查，黎指警方絕對是打壓新聞自由，形容：『煮到埋嚟咪食，冇得擔心，擔心唔到咁多。』」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，報導指：「警方搜查行動至傍晚6時許才結束，其間拆走伺服器及取走《蘋果》基金部份文件。本報副社長陳沛敏在 Facebook 表明，『所有同事會繼續編採工作。新聞繼續發佈，報紙明天照常出街。』」控方問陳為何會在 Facebook 發文。陳稱，因為很多新聞界行家都查詢翌日《蘋果》報紙能否出版，大家都不知道案件詳情，所以她發佈帖文，好像是「話畀出面嘅人知，我哋個個人仲喺報館做緊嘢，個網站仲有即時新聞出街，呢單新聞又好，其他新聞又好，其實已經知道公司聽日係會有報紙出到街嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;頭版報導下方有堅守崗位撐到底聲明-陳沛敏稱是其主意-表達公司看法&quot;&gt;頭版報導下方有「堅守崗位，撐到底！」聲明 陳沛敏稱是其主意 表達公司看法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，新聞報導下方有一個類似聲明的欄目，題為：「堅守崗位，撐到底！」陳稱這是她的主意，不過內文並非由她撰寫，而是她叫文筆較好的同事按照她的主意撰寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問這聲明是否反映她真心所相信的事情。陳表示：「當時係，因為覺得搜報館係好大件事，咁同埋張生嗰一句說話『蘋果一定撐落去』」，加上當時很多新聞界同業人士曾問公司對於事件的立場，因此她根據張劍虹該句說話的意思及精神，「啫係要表達一下我哋對呢件事嘅睇法囉。」她確認同意聲明內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早前曾稱預料昨日（2月21日）能完成主問，惟直至今日仍未完成。控方在散庭前表示，有信心可在下星期一（2月26日）內完成主問，但餘下部份需時不會短。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押後至下星期一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China policy has changed markedly on both sides of the Atlantic in the past decade, transatlantic cooperation on China remains limited in extent and impact, ad hoc and reactive. Yet enhanced pooling of efforts and more systematic cooperation promises increased policy effectiveness. This paper investigates the reasons for this limited cooperation on China in three separate but related domains: economics; security; and the multilateral system and global norms. It identifies where there is a need for better mutual understanding of divergent positions, and where and through what mechanisms cooperation might be strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transatlantic partners agree that China represents a challenge, even a threat. There is consensus on the need for de-risking, on the desire to maintain the security status quo in the Indo-Pacific, and on the need to counter China’s actions on the world stage. In its specifics, however, the challenge looks different on each side of the Atlantic. The US is concerned about threats to its technological, military and economic leadership, whereas Europe’s focus is on the risks of economic dependency, with some concern about China’s agenda for global governance. There is also significant divergence between European countries, which makes even a common European position challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the economic domain, countries have different interpretations and priorities for de-risking. The US prioritises defending its leadership in certain key technologies, while European countries focus on diversifying their economic relationship with China and maintaining strong commercial connections. There is also a difference of pace and urgency, with the US wanting to move more quickly than most European countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the security domain, there is consensus across the Atlantic on the need to uphold the existing Indo-Pacific order against Beijing’s attempts to overturn it. In contrast with the US’s dominant role on security matters in the Indo-Pacific, European partners are best placed to do more in non-traditional security domains and to strengthen economic deterrence. Continued European reliance on the US security umbrella in Europe suggests the need for an explicit transatlantic discussion on how security efforts in Europe and the Indo-Pacific link together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the multilateral system and global norms, there is agreement on the challenge but divergence on specifics. Recent years have seen a more cohesive G7 and its informal expansion at times to a G7+. However, the transatlantic partners have done much less than China in proposing an updated vision of global governance that is appealing to the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective transatlantic cooperation requires alignment, if not agreement, on the urgency and severity of the challenge posed by China. But joint action demands specifics and granularity and, on this level, there is as much disagreement as agreement. More effective transatlantic cooperation begins with the recognition of this plurality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to strengthen transatlantic cooperation, this paper proposes that partners invest in a process that articulates a realistic shared vision for future China relations; a target “endgame” to guide cooperation. Without a clear view of what future relations with China would look like, it is hard to develop policy and judge if that policy is appropriate or effective. The different positions on each side of the Atlantic mean that there is also benefit in investing in a structured transatlantic process to narrow perception gaps about the risks and benefits that China brings. The security domain offers the greatest potential for increased clarity on roles and activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, China policy in North America and Europe has shifted dramatically from seeing Beijing primarily as an economic partner of choice to framing it as an economic, technological, diplomatic and security challenge. This transformation has been accelerated by changes in China as Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, has centralised power, curbed opposition and adopted a more assertive foreign and security policy. Understanding that such an “epoch-defining challenge”, as the UK government puts it, requires a coordinated and comprehensive response, the US and its key allies have toughened their policies towards China and explored various forms of policy coordination across a wide spectrum of issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordination both enhances policy effectiveness (for example, on technology controls) and allows cost- and burden-sharing (for example, on security provision). However, the transatlantic approach to date remains more reactive and ad hoc than systematic and cooperative. Effective cooperation requires more than a list of abstract principles and disparate grievances about aspects of the current challenge. It requires the governments concerned to have a clearer view of an “endgame”, in other words, to articulate the outlines of a desirable future relationship with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper concludes a Chatham House–RUSI research project (supported by the Carnegie Corporation of New York) focused on transatlantic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. The first paper in the project profiled the priorities of the US and Europe in the Indo-Pacific. The second reviewed how key Indo-Pacific partners assessed this engagement. This final paper outlines the limits and possibilities of transatlantic cooperation by examining the current state of China policy in key areas of mutual interest. It explores the extent to which transatlantic partners’ objectives, both explicit and implicit, are truly shared, and considers how to best manage divergent interests within a broader frame of cooperation. The paper seeks to clarify the tensions in discussions about transatlantic China policy, rather than exhaustively examining all China-related questions. Understanding these perspectives, and their underlying rationales, is vital for effective future transatlantic cooperation on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper is situated within the findings of several studies that approached aspects of this subject between 2019 and 2022. The paper is designed to complement these studies by eliciting observations and proposals from policy practitioners (public officials and experts) drawn from across the US and Europe who agreed to discuss possible endgames for their respective China policies. Workshops with these practitioners were held throughout 2023 in London, Berlin and Washington, DC with the aim of promoting a forward-looking debate among key policymakers about the trajectory of transatlantic China policies in the areas of economics, security and global governance. Participants were selected based on their seniority, expertise and breadth of professional backgrounds, spanning foreign ministries, defence ministries, intelligence agencies, think tanks, academia and the private sector. In all, workshop participants joined from all the largest transatlantic countries to provide a diversity of views. The workshops applied the Chatham House Rule to ensure that participants could speak openly about sensitive issues. Clarity on areas of divergence as well as convergence is vital to fostering deeper cooperation on China that fully accounts for the financial and other costs that accompany – but should not outweigh – the benefits of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has three sections, reflecting the three domains at the heart of transatlantic China policies: economics; security; and the contest for the multilateral system and global norms. These domains are interlinked but reflect distinct areas of policy focus. The paper argues that, in the economic domain, the absence of a shared vision for the preferred future relationship with China makes it difficult to reach agreement, both on the scale of sacrifice justified in gaining the strategic payoff and on how to distribute the cost. In the security domain, differences in capacity and role specialisation produce complementarities that can make cooperation more effective, through a division of labour. When it comes to the multilateral system and norms, transatlantic cooperation has been most effective in the context of a revived, more prominent role for the G7 (at the expense of the G20), its informal extension to a G7+, and the formation of new issue-specific minilateral frameworks. The outlook in established multilateral institutions is cloudier. While the G7+ now cooperate more effectively at a tactical level to counter China’s growing influence, they do not offer a common and compelling grand narrative about world order. US engagement is particularly prone to change depending on the administration. In light of this, purchase on the wider global governance agenda is faltering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economics&quot;&gt;ECONOMICS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest shifts in China policy across the US and Europe have come on the economic front. Liberal democracies have substantially reassessed the risks and rewards of doing business with and in China. After some initial calls for a broad “decoupling” from China, the US, Canada, Japan and key European allies settled on the concept of “de-risking” at the G7 leaders’ meeting in Hiroshima, Japan, in May 2023. However, according to a participant in the London workshop, “De-risking is ambiguous. It can mean all things to all people”. For China, “de-risking is just decoupling in disguise”, added another participant, quoting Chinese state media. One objective of the workshops was to identify areas of agreement and substantive divergence among transatlantic partners on de-risking, as well as promoting more open recognition of these tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was broad consensus about the economic risks posed by China. These included: a perceived over-reliance on China for critical imports such as processed rare earth minerals; Beijing’s use of outbound direct investment and research partnerships to acquire sensitive, often dual-use, technologies; and the presence of forced labour in some, especially Xinjiang-linked, supply chains. These come on top of longstanding concerns about intellectual property theft and lack of reciprocal market access. China’s use of economic coercion – for example, against Lithuania and Australia – was also mentioned, although less frequently by US participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across Europe and the US, governments have implemented a range of defensive measures to mitigate these risks. These include enhanced inbound investment screening; intensified scrutiny of Chinese university partnerships and research students; export controls; legislation to ban the use of forced labour in supply chains; and the EU’s Anti-Coercion Instrument. The modest extent of cooperation in this area is made clear by the varied scope and stringency of these measures, both between EU member states and between Europe and the US, especially relating to outbound investment and export controls, where the policy debate has only just started in Europe. This reflects differing views on the scale and urgency of the risks relative to the benefits of continuing economic engagement. Such differences come in part from different starting points: unlike Europe, the US is a global military and technology leader and therefore faces unique risks to its power from China’s growing technological sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fissure on the extent and purpose of de-risking emerged during the workshops. The US is seeking to maintain its technological lead over China, not to simply reduce risks; in the words of National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the US wants to keep a “small yard and high fence” to protect key US technologies from China. In September 2022 he said: “Given the foundational nature of certain technologies, such as advanced logic and memory chips, we must maintain as large of a lead as possible”. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has since argued that measures would be “transparent, narrowly scoped, and targeted to clear objectives … not used by us to gain economic advantage”. Indeed, US commercial engagement with China remains strong outside the targeted technologies. Workshop participants acknowledged, however, that these targeted technologies are inherently dual use. As such, export controls also affect China’s economic development. For some, this is an inescapable by-product of the national security objective, for others, a welcome brake on China’s growth. Many workshop participants were concerned that the yard would get bigger and the fence higher as US–China relations became locked in an escalating cycle of economic countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European perspective is different. As one participant put it: “De-risking is a question of degree and time: the US wants a rapid de-risking. Italy and many others in the EU agree with de-risking, but don’t want to move so quickly or widely”. For Europe, resilience and diversification in the face of China’s coercive use of trade relations are the priorities, which by and large allow the benefits of bilateral trade and investment to continue. The large business delegations that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron took to Beijing in 2022 and 2023 suggest that the EU’s biggest economies remain hopeful about economic opportunities, despite the continuing challenges facing China’s now slower-growth economy. Other European workshop participants made clear their appetite to partner with China to gain access to electric vehicle technology. Given China’s leadership in renewable technologies, workshop participants questioned whether there could be a “green Europe” without China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US drive to maintain technological and economic supremacy over China is intimately linked to the Biden (and previously the Trump) administration’s efforts to revitalise the US economy through trade protectionism and industrial policy. The Biden administration is quite explicit about its pursuit of a “foreign policy for the middle class”. The adoption of large subsidies and incentives for those investing in the US, under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), represents a direct competitive threat to the industrial development of European nations, which seem less able to offer similar incentives for companies to invest in Europe. Although one participant in the Washington, DC workshop argued that the CHIPS Act and the IRA would present companies from key ally states with substantial opportunities to invest in the US, most officials and experts acknowledged that this is a fundamental tension in transatlantic China policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous joint statements from US and European leaders have called for cooperation on supply chain resilience and coordination in combating China’s use of economic coercion. The 13-member Minerals Security Partnership is a rare example of transatlantic cooperation (and beyond) to secure resilient supply chains. Other initiatives are not transatlantic in nature. For the US, both the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) and the Quad plan to address supply chain resilience in broad terms, while numerous European initiatives do not include the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond rare earth minerals, however, participants across the three workshops argued that many countries have yet to work out which are the most critical economic chokepoints and what are the realistic options for diversification. A participant in the Berlin workshop said: “On economic security, there are so many instruments that often the tail is wagging the dog”. Another suggested that: “We need to ask what we want to achieve, and we need to differentiate between trade volume and trade quality. What is ‘safe’ trade with China? There’s a difference between dependence and vulnerability”. Workshop participants from Eastern Europe placed a greater urgency on diversifying away from China than did those from southern Europe. According to one: “We are already decoupling and learning lessons from Russia”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the results of EU risk assessments are more consistent with US policy than might be suggested by these differing views across Europe and the lack of an analytical mechanism supporting transatlantic cooperation; the first proposed set of restricted export technologies from the EU mirrors the US list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also highlighted the need for a more broadly contextualised conversation about the potential costs of de-risking for governments, companies and society. This needs to go hand in hand with an assessment of the costs of inaction. Many multinationals are reducing their reliance on China-based manufacturing, even as overall trade with China remains strong. German Chancellor Scholz has gone as far as to say that “de-risking … is mainly about decisions that need to be taken by companies”. But commercial interests alone are not sufficient to de-risk vulnerabilities in critical national infrastructure. How willing are governments to impose national security decisions that harm commercial interests? Greater transatlantic coordination on areas such as export controls would likely make such measures more effective. But more coordination would require explicit agreement on burden sharing, not only between the transatlantic governments, but also with other allies, including Australia, Japan and South Korea, to ensure that no country’s companies benefit unduly at the expense of others. According to one participant: “There’s still no answer as to who bears the cost of de-risking”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the biggest questions about vulnerabilities and de-risking can only be answered at a sovereign, national level. But participants did call for transatlantic governments to deepen their conversation about the competitive and cooperative elements of de-risking. The EU–US Trade and Technology Council, established in 2021, is intended to take on part of this role. However, several participants argued that it was yet to show much progress, and that time is taken up more with resolving differences between the US and the EU. The development of G7 (and G7+) processes to some extent brings in the UK and other non-EU partners, chiefly Australia, Japan and South Korea. Beyond talking, several participants argued that the best way to ensure more resilience and deeper transatlantic cooperation in the face of China’s manufacturing strength is for the US to embrace trade and economic liberalisation once again, indicated by one participant’s comment: “True diversification will require a level playing field in the US”. Political realities may stand in the way of this for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;SECURITY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While transatlantic governments are seeking to alter the economic status quo with China, in the area of security they see themselves as trying to uphold the existing order against Beijing’s attempts to overturn it. Compared with the economic domain, China’s challenge to the security status quo appears more clearly defined and views on it are broadly shared on both sides of the Atlantic. But there are significant differences in perceptions of the urgency of the China challenge, in estimates of the acceptable costs of deterring potential crises, and in views on how those costs should be fairly distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prime example is Taiwan, where the US and its European allies agree that their interests are best served by the preservation of the current position, ensuring no use of force and no unilateral change to the island’s ambiguous international status. While there has been no change in Beijing’s formal position on Taiwan (commitment to reunification and not renouncing the use of force if necessary), there has been increased Chinese military and grey-zone activity, especially since 2020. Workshop participants broadly shared the view that the risk of Beijing acting on Taiwan has increased significantly as its military capabilities grow and its regional behaviour has become more assertive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the South China Sea, as well as the Indo-Pacific more broadly, workshop participants consistently stressed that the US and Europe wish to maintain freedom of navigation and overflight, and to ensure that any disputes are resolved through negotiation according to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and not by coercion. They reported that they view Beijing’s island-building, the aggressive behaviour of its maritime and air forces, and its claims to almost the entire South China Sea (and rejection of the 2016 UNCLOS Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling on China’s excessive claims to maritime rights in the South China Sea) as unilateral attempts to alter the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many European governments, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine heightened concerns about China’s security ambitions. This is both because of the Russia–China partnership, however substantive, and the stark reminder, very close to home, that expansionary wars under the threat of nuclear weapons are not consigned to the past. Some workshop participants argued that the war in Ukraine might presage an eventual “division of labour” between the US and Europe, with the former taking the lead in deterring China in the Indo-Pacific while Europe focuses on countering Russia in its own backyard (requiring Europe to substantially increase defence spending). However, most participants argued that the war had highlighted the indivisibility of the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific, with some warning of the risks of tackling the two geographies separately. This all highlights the need for broader and deeper security consultation, and perhaps even deeper cooperation, between US allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. As Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said in June 2022: “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the US and its European allies have broadly similar interests, they assign different degrees of importance to these interests, and bring very different capabilities to bear. In terms of military power, participants agreed that within Europe, only the UK and France have the capacity and geographical reach to maintain a continuous – albeit limited – presence in the Indo-Pacific, although Germany too is keen to show that it can do more. Other European nations can contribute in areas not requiring conventional power projection, such as cyber security and countering disinformation. The UK and France, with or without the rest of Europe, clearly have much less effect on the military balance of power in the Indo-Pacific than does the US. Beyond military deployments, workshop participants argued that European nations could contribute the most by helping to reinforce the US alliance system and by doing more in non-traditional security, such as maritime law. Both areas strengthen deterrence, which is the priority in maintaining the status quo. As one participant in the workshop in Washington, DC explained, “the perception of a network of allies and partners is important for deterring China”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely in response to China’s growing assertiveness, the US’s European and Indo-Pacific allies have been deepening their security links. Since 2022, the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea (the “AP4”) have attended NATO summits. However, even after China appeared in the 2019 NATO Strategic Concept, NATO’s role in the Indo-Pacific continues to be debated. France in particular has argued for countries to engage individually in the region rather than as Alliance members, blocking a NATO liaison office in Tokyo. Other workshop participants mentioned NATO’s existing out-of-region liaison offices and the AP4’s appetite for a higher NATO profile in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK stands out among its European allies in being part of two strategically important defence procurement partnerships that could, if successful, affect the region’s military balance of power over the medium to long term. One workshop participant described the Australia–UK–US (AUKUS) partnership announced in 2021, through which the UK and the US are helping Australia to acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines and are cooperating on advanced technologies, as “the jewel in the crown”. AUKUS training arrangements will also see UK attack submarines regularly deployed to the region from 2027, bolstering the persistent presence in the Indo-Pacific that Britain restored in 2021. The Global Combat Air Programme, in which Italy has joined Japan and the UK to develop a next-generation stealth fighter that will come into service in the mid-2030s, is a second instance of a strategic commitment to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was widespread agreement in the workshops on the value of increasing cooperation on non-traditional security across the Indo-Pacific, and with respect to Taiwan specifically. China is especially active in grey-zone tactics that project power beneath the threshold of overt armed conflict. Such tactics make the calibration of responses more challenging. Chinese cyber activity and influence operations are widespread across the region, including in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and the Pacific Islands. The UK and other European countries should support Taiwan on cyber resilience and undersea cable protection. In the case of Taiwan, one participant in London proposed Finland and Switzerland as countries that could share lessons on whole-of-society defence and resilience. European support on disaster relief and countering illegal fishing, smuggling and narcotics activity would also be welcomed in the region. This would be less sensitive than traditional security engagement, and could complement the higher-profile US hard security presence and US Coast Guard activities. Just as with hard security, participants spoke of the need for better coordination of such activities between countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation here is seen in patterns of execution and implementation, within broadly agreed complementary roles for each side of the Atlantic, rather than being a product of formal multilateral arrangements. A deeper divergence was, however, clear and consistent across all three workshops: there were striking differences between the US and many European participants on the urgency of the need to strengthen deterrence of Chinese action on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With smaller militaries, and without collective defence commitments in the region requiring their militaries to deploy forward at scale, Europeans are staking less than the US on maintaining the security status quo in the Indo-Pacific. And they are more risk averse. While the Pentagon talks about China as the “pacing challenge”, participants across all three workshops expressed concern that European governments were too optimistic about the odds of avoiding conflict over Taiwan. One participant said: “Europe is not alarmed enough about the risks to Taiwan”. The US may not have large numbers of troops based in Taiwan, but it does have a commitment under its own domestic legislation to ensure Taiwan has the means to defend itself, putting its credibility on the line. One participant argued that European partners could do more to contribute to deterrence by making “clear to China publicly and privately that war over Taiwan would have disastrous economic consequences”, adding that “any perception of European indifference over a Taiwan conflict makes it more likely”. Closed door discussions seem to be taking place, but deterrence requires more. It requires signalling and demonstrating the preparation of credible sanctions that would follow a Chinese attack. Given China’s grey-zone tactics and potential to, say, impose a blockade on Taiwan, work is needed on a spectrum of responses to different triggers. But without political, let alone legal, commitments to Taiwan, Europe does not face a credibility risk comparable to that of the US. The different stance on de-risking also reflects the fact that sanctions policy is within the competence of the EU and as such requires unanimity, making it a more difficult weapon to unsheathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased sharing by the US of the intelligence underpinning its security threat assessment in the Indo-Pacific may lead to greater, more urgent efforts in Europe. Additionally, any move by the US to link its security support in Europe to a more formal European commitment to Indo-Pacific security would incentivise a more serious discussion. This might result in a commitment to economic sanctions over Taiwan in specific circumstances, or a further shifting of resources from the European theatre to the Indo-Pacific. The case of Taiwan suggests that, while such a serious discussion might be the basis for coordinated security policy on the Indo-Pacific, it does not seem to be taking place. Unsurprisingly, then, beyond the question of Taiwan, there seems to be little agreement on or thinking about the outline of a new security equilibrium in the Indo-Pacific in response to China’s perceptions of what constitute its own legitimate security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While maintaining the status quo remains a shared transatlantic objective, China’s own security ambitions continue to grow alongside its military capabilities. Xi’s Global Security Initiative, launched in 2022, offers an all-encompassing if vague “vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security”. It is again the US leading the pushback in the Indo-Pacific against China’s attempts to sign security partnerships – successful in the case of the Solomon Islands, but unsuccessful with 10 Pacific Island states. The Partners in the Blue Pacific initiative does, however, represent a renewed allied willingness to engage and invest in the Pacific Islands, where China has become more active, with the UK, Canada and Germany as members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remains too the question of where discussion and agreement with China on security matters is desirable and possible, with the Middle East an obvious area of potential cooperation, as well as competition. European workshop participants saw a greater need than those from the US to include China, and find ways where engagement can work. Potential areas include smuggling, piracy and illegal fishing. At a global level there is a need to define agreements in emerging areas such as AI and space, but making progress remains challenging while China sees its own opacity and unpredictability as a source of leverage. China has only just agreed to restore the military-to-military contacts with the US that were broken off for over a year following the visit of US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in August 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multilateral-institutions-and-global-norms&quot;&gt;MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS AND GLOBAL NORMS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area of global governance, most participants maintained that Beijing represented a serious challenge to US and European global interests, although several argued that China’s global ambitions were far more limited than most analysts assume. US and European governments are in broad agreement about the need to support the multilateral system in a way that addresses today’s global challenges, while reinforcing the rules-based international order (RBIO). There is increasingly a tendency in Chinese rhetoric to equate the RBIO with the US-led global order, and therefore to seek a stronger position for China in existing multilateral institutions by various means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has become increasingly active on this front, emphasising the importance of UN institutions, seeking reform, competing more actively for leadership roles and investing in acquiring posts for its citizens. Chinese diplomats repeatedly position China as the champion of the UN system. In areas such as human rights, cyber sovereignty and the setting of some technology standards, China seeks to redefine key elements of the RBIO in ways that differ markedly from what is acceptable to the transatlantic partners. On human rights, China is seeking to shift the narrative away from universal individual political rights, of the sort enshrined by liberal democracies, to communal development and security rights as determined by each nation. This all comes at a time when there is a pressing need to develop rules, norms and standards in areas such as climate, technology, data and AI. Additionally, China has at times not complied with rulings that run counter to its own position, notably the 2016 UNCLOS ruling on the South China Sea. During the Covid-19 pandemic, China’s actions to obfuscate and block World Health Organization (WHO) investigations reinforced these concerns. In parallel to seeking increased influence within the UN system, China has launched a series of expansive, loosely defined initiatives including the Belt and Road (BRI) Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Global Development Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative. While deriding US-led minilaterals such as the Quad and the G7 as examples of “forming ‘blocs’”, Beijing is driving an expansion of groupings such as the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, where it has a leading role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While participants in the Berlin, London and Washington, DC workshops confirmed this shared view of this challenge, they identified clear differences about how best to respond. Policy experts and officials acknowledged several fundamental tensions. Firstly, between a US that is increasingly sceptical about the effectiveness of global institutions and is in many places creating its own new minilateral structures, and its European allies, which are much more committed to a more-inclusive multilateralism, both in principle and as a function of their status as middle powers. Secondly, between the need to reform global institutions to incorporate a bigger voice for developing nations, and the desire to maintain the dominance of the US and its allies. And thirdly, between the ambition to pursue pragmatic cooperation with influential nations in the Global South and to compete more effectively there with China, and practical limitations on financial resources, coupled with a desire to defend human rights and advance democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the workshops there was little agreement on how to reform existing multilateral institutions in ways acceptable on both sides of the Atlantic. One participant said “the US has been on the wrong side of the argument” in opposing quota changes at the World Bank. The US decision not to nominate members to the WTO’s Appellate Body after 2011 undercuts the argument that China must fulfil promises it made about transitioning to a market economy. While the Biden administration has rejoined the Paris climate agreement, the WHO and UNESCO, a future Republican president may change course again and be less interested in reform of the UN system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many participants argued that this reflected the reality that the US and China were increasingly at odds in multilateral forums, and that global institutions had struggled to make meaningful contributions on both Covid-19 and Ukraine. One participant said: “In future, global multilateral institutions will be places of contestation between the US and its allies and partners against China and other illiberal powers”. Reaching agreement in the G20 has also become more difficult, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Increasingly, transatlantic partners have turned to the G7 for policy coordination, extending invitations to a select group of G7+ countries such as India, South Korea and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More positively, several participants argued that Western countries have responded well on a tactical level to China’s increased efforts in the UN system. Coordination and responsiveness between the allies have improved. One participant cited as an example the appointment of Singaporean Daren Tang as head of the World Intellectual Property Organization over China’s candidate. However, another participant described the West as having “walked off the pitch” in pushing back against China’s reinterpretations of UN resolutions. Chinese diplomats are investing substantial time in embedding Chinese initiatives such as the Global Development Initiative into UN processes and statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other participants, however, warned of the dangers of viewing global institutions and the contest for global values and norms in such Manichean terms. Many called for the US and European allies to cooperate more effectively in their engagement with the Global South, offering more tangible development benefits and supporting the agency of these countries even when they do not agree with Western policy. This becomes more critical as the G7 grows in importance relative to the G20 for the US and Europe. According to one participant, “We need to be more comfortable with countries in the Global South saying no to us … We need to embrace regional bodies like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum because they’re binding China to the regional architecture”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of the reform of global institutions, US participants spoke of the benefits of “variable geometry” and “coalitions of the willing”, of pragmatically including different countries on different topics. This is consistent with a 2021 speech in which Jake Sullivan referred to a “latticework of alliances and partnerships”. The US has indeed launched a series of minilateral initiatives, such as the Quad, the IPEF, AUKUS, Partners in the Blue Pacific and the Minerals Security Partnership – some only with Indo-Pacific countries and some with its larger transatlantic partners. One European participant questioned whether the US wants Europe as an ally in the Indo-Pacific, or whether it is content to develop separate Indo-Pacific-facing structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narrative was a major point of contention in discussions about the multilateral order, reflecting the importance of what the Chinese Communist Party calls “discourse power”. There was agreement that China has a more appealing narrative to many countries in the Global South, one that prioritises non-intervention and economic development over international law and individual human rights. China’s initiatives and its engagement with the UN appear to offer the Global South more than the West does, even if the initiatives lack detail and are met with healthy scepticism in much of the Global South. China continues to expand its ambitions here, launching in September 2023 its proposals and actions for “A Global Community of Shared Future”. Several participants noted that there was no competing narrative from the US and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration and the UK government have in the past year dialled down any rhetoric about facing China in a battle between autocracies and democracies. Participants broadly agreed that framing competition with Beijing in terms of values would alienate many developing countries, including key partners such as India and Indonesia, with one stating: “The narrative that works for the US and Europe doesn’t work for much of Asia” and “rules resonate more than values in Asia”. However, several participants warned that Europe and Asia could not afford to sit on the sidelines as China promotes its alternative vision of the global order. Japan and India were both proposed as countries that could take a more prominent role in advocating visions that are different from China’s and not suffer from perceptions of Western hegemony. Participants noted too that narrative alone was not enough. Perceptions persist that China offers development support unrivalled by the US and Europe, although China prioritises lending over development assistance and its terms are often opaque and unattractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussions about global institutions and norms yielded the least consensus among participants, largely because there is little consensus within Europe and the US about how much to invest in reforming the multilateral system at a time when confidence within the West about the universal applicability of human rights and democracy seems to be waning. Most participants could agree, at least, on the need for new thinking, with one saying, “The post-war unipolar moment is gone … Rather than trying to prop it up, how do we shape the new emerging order? China has competing visions of the international order across the digital, technology, climate and security domains. How can we generate a collective response?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves unresolved the question of how and where to engage China on global governance. European countries have shown a greater appetite to engage with China through multilateral structures. The Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which has its headquarters in Beijing, continues to have 14 European members, while the US did not join. Several European countries enthusiastically joined the BRI, although Italy has now exited. The EU has resumed its human rights dialogue with China. Within the Indo-Pacific, however, engagement with China is integral to international relations – either through Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade agreement, or the ASEAN+3 discussions, or China’s applications to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement. Perhaps, as one participant suggested, “The Indo-Pacific is the crucible for the rules-based order of the future”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-and-policy-implications&quot;&gt;CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trend towards enhanced transatlantic coordination on China policy has intensified under the Biden administration. Yet, as discussions move beyond broad principles to specific policies, uncertainties arise and threaten to blunt implementation. Are objectives and desired endgames really shared, or even brought into focus at all? Do governments have similar assessments of the China challenge, of the urgency and need to act, and of their respective roles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across economics, security and global governance, policy practitioners at the workshops highlighted agreement on objectives among the transatlantic partners, but only in terms broad enough to allow space for different interpretations. There is consensus on the need for de-risking, the desire to maintain the security status quo in the Indo-Pacific, and the need to counter China’s actions on the world stage and its alternative vision for world order. But joint action demands specifics and granularity, and on that level, there is as much disagreement as agreement. More effective transatlantic cooperation begins with the recognition of this plurality. This would allow the transatlantic partners either to strive for a common understanding or to design complementary – or, at least, non-contradictory – actions that take account of what may prove a chronic divergence of views. European officials know that Beijing tries to play them off against each other and against the US. Indeed, China’s persistent efforts to create such divisions are a strong signal of the benefits of closer cooperation for transatlantic partners where objectives are truly shared. But Europeans also want the US to better understand their own interests. There is no reason to fear that acknowledging differences signals disunity to China if broad overall agreement remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the economic sphere, the US sees de-risking as an urgent imperative to preserve its technological leadership so as to protect its national security while building better capabilities at home, even where this limits its continuing and very large commercial relationship with China. For most of Europe, the China threat feels less urgent. Two years into the war in Ukraine, Xi continues to express his friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but European policy on China remains defined by a logic of economic security, with resilience at the centre, pursued largely through diversification, while maintaining beneficial commercial engagement. Differences in risk assessment and economic interests within Europe make extensive pan-European cooperation difficult. In the case of EU members, the division of policy responsibilities between the European Commission and the member states makes it more difficult still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly powerful transatlantic cooperation requires alignment, if not agreement, on the urgency and severity of the security threat posed by a more technologically capable China. Absent that, the greatest potential for cooperation lies in continuous case-by-case engagement on the specifics of the highest priority cases and why action is justified. Adjusting US industrial policy so that European partners see it as less of a competitive threat to Europe’s own ambitions would also enhance cooperation, accelerating “friendshoring” for resilience. European partners seek reassurance, too, that American companies will not benefit at their expense if they go along with US controls. The political and practical challenges of implementing this in the US remain significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On matters of Indo-Pacific security, agreement on policy objectives goes beyond the broad principles and is more specific. The current limited number of European actors able to project military capabilities in a crisis scenario leaves the US as the dominant security provider in the Indo-Pacific. This makes for a clear division of roles and capabilities between the transatlantic partners, and would seem to lay the ground for complementary, mutually reinforcing actions. The workshops confirmed a US perspective that Europe’s most important role is economic, but also identified areas of soft security where a larger number of European actors are well placed to act. However, this structural stability is at odds with divergent threat perceptions across the Atlantic, and with divergences over the need to build credibility and deterrence now with China with regard to the economic consequences of an attack on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent need to put into action a range of continuing non-traditional security measures through which European countries help strengthen Taiwan’s resilience and support regional security. Greater information sharing by the US of its risk assessments may change views in Europe on the urgency of action, especially beyond the UK, France and Germany. Alternatively, the US might choose to make an explicit link between its continued security support in Europe and the actions it sees as required in the Indo-Pacific. Although evidence collected for this paper focused on Taiwan, such an understanding might apply to other aspects of European soft security in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outlook for cooperation is least promising in global governance. There is, again, broad agreement on the need to counter the adulteration of universal principles (for example, human rights) that has resulted from China’s attempts to elevate its influence in the UN and other global institutions. Through the stronger role for the G7+, and a burgeoning number of minilateral “latticework” structures, transatlantic partners and other like-minded countries are creating issue-focused structures. However, larger-scale cooperation, for example a revival of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement or an integration with the similar CPTPP agreement in Asia, appears beyond the realm of the possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also lacking is a credible plan for global governance that goes beyond the primary focus on like-minded countries. As China positions itself as champion of the Global South in the UN system, transatlantic partners do not have practical reform proposals that will help developing nations gain a greater voice in global institutions. The US’s appetite to engage is uncertain. A change of administration may bring clarity, albeit in the form of reduced engagement. For the Global South, China has a narrative and continues to provide, albeit on terms that are sometimes onerous and opaque, convincing quantities of financing. The US and Europe should put more effort into articulating a similar compelling narrative for the Global South – indeed, simply listening to the perspectives of others would be a good start. Initiatives such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships in Indonesia and Vietnam indicate movement in this direction, but finding the money to scale this up will be difficult at times of competing budgetary pressures at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the scale of the challenge from China, cooperation will be vital for an effective China policy in the US and Europe. The research for this paper has highlighted the benefit of taking the time to understand the foundations and mechanics of successful cooperation. These include: shared assessments of the nature, scale and urgency of the challenge; an understanding of where specific objectives are shared and where they are not; and a willingness and ability to take action in pursuit of these objectives. These principles are even more important at a time of heightened political uncertainty in the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes continue in China too. Alongside stronger technological capabilities and increased military spending, China’s economy is struggling to find new sources of growth amid a real-estate crisis, high debt levels and an ageing population. Notable in the workshop discussions was a sense that China’s direction is fixed, known and not amenable to influence from within or without. This marks a sharp shift from the over-optimistic views of the past, that engagement by the West would put China on the path to political liberalisation. Now the pendulum may have swung too far the other way. There was extensive discussion during the workshops on the essentially defensive measures needed to address challenges from China, but few contributions on how the transatlantic partners view relations with China in the round, as China continues to play a major role in the global economy and safeguard its own security concerns. A serious search for a vision of the “endgame” for relations with China as a basis on which to structure long-term transatlantic cooperation would benefit from placing less weight on China’s cohesion and strength, and paying more attention to some of its underlying domestic weaknesses, not to mention its ability to change course, well demonstrated by Communist Party leadership in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopes that the end of the Trump presidency would improve conditions for transatlantic cooperation on China have not been entirely fulfilled. Two points may help explain this. First, while investment in understanding China on the part of the US and Europe has increased, institutional support for transatlantic understanding and dialogue is relatively neglected. Without a determined and resourced effort to develop channels for regular, open and honest dialogue on commonalities and differences, transatlantic cooperation will continue to fall behind. Second, levels of knowledge and political confidence on both sides of the Atlantic seem insufficient to project a positive picture of what relations with China could or should become in the future. The result is a mismatch: on the one hand, grandiose assessments of China, described by the UK as an “epoch-making challenge” and by the US as “the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it”, and on the other, a set of primarily defensive policy actions taken by countries individually and G7 declarations that communicate alignment but deliver limited specific action. How an endgame vision for desired future relations with China can help set transatlantic allies on a path of closer cooperation to make that vision a reality is an urgent question for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第九天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續圍繞《蘋果日報》英文版的醞釀時期提問。控方展示黎智英於2020年5月13日轉發給陳沛敏的訊息：「偉光，寫英文文章寫得好還有劉慧卿，請邀她寫。謝謝。」控方指這訊息原本是黎傳送給羅，為何後來會轉發給陳？陳表示：「我覺得純粹係畀我知道囉。」被問到有否協助尋找英文版寫手，陳表示印象中她沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;群組訊息曾提及2020年5月在美港人眾籌登廣告，控方展示最終刊登的頭版廣告，可見美國國旗，寫有「在美港人全力撐」、「五大訴求，缺一不可」、「光復香港，時代革命」。陳則指時任動新聞平台總監張志偉負責管理廣告版面，而不是由她負責，張會告訴她不同廣告在實體報紙所需佔的版面，因此新聞排版時會配合。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果新疆再教育營專題曾獲人權新聞&quot;&gt;《蘋果》新疆再教育營專題曾獲人權新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月13日，時任動新聞平台總監張志偉在「English news」群組發送訊息，指《蘋果》靜態組早前做了「囚牢之疆」專題調查活動網站（minisite），獲得「2020年人權新聞獎」之「多媒體（中文）」大獎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問「囚牢之疆」是關於什麼，陳表示：「我相信應該係講新疆嗰啲⋯⋯有啲人畀政府拉咗入去，畀政府教化、懲教嗰啲。」控方提醒陳說話時避免以「我相信」作開頭，因為法庭需要知道的是證人對事件是否有認知。陳其後補充：「我理解當地政府拘捕咗一啲少數民族，啫係維吾爾族人士，擺咗去一啲懲教設施度。」不過由於「囚牢之疆」網頁此前已經發布，她閱畢張志偉的訊息後並沒有進入網頁的連結查看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英訊息稱英文版應著重大陸新聞-疫後反中情緒是美國人最需要看&quot;&gt;黎智英訊息稱英文版應著重大陸新聞 疫後反中情緒是「美國人最需要看」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示黎智英於2020年5月13日發送給群組的訊息：「我越想越覺得英文版應該着重大陸新聞，專題和文章花絮等。在疫情肆虐後掀起的反中情緒，這些是美國人最需要看。我們把大陸方面內容質量做到最好尤其重要，訂閱我們的都會是有識之士，對新聞要求比一般人高。我們的目標是提供外國人在南華早報看不到的中國新聞，打破南早在這方面的壟斷。本地新聞專題和評論每天佔十一、二篇，而大陸的十篇八篇，每天總共二十一、二篇加上影片和漫畫花絮便足夠了。」陳沛敏確認《蘋果》英文版後來有執行到黎此項建議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示：「我覺得嗰時黎生係落緊一個指示，英文版要點樣」，所以她其後在群組中回覆黎「收到，謝謝」。被問到陳有否執行黎的指示，陳稱：「其實我冇咩嘢要執行」，因為英文版只限於網站，而她是負責實體報紙，她回覆黎只是想表示知悉相關討論，若果網站之後有適合的中國新聞便會改寫並擺在實體報紙。她形容自己這方面「角色比較被動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英擔心國安法影響法治人權和新聞機構&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英擔心國安法影響法治、人權和新聞機構&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月21日黎智英與陳沛敏之間的 WhatsApp 對話，二人談及國安法將要生效，控方問黎有否向陳提及《蘋果》會如何反應？陳指當時法律條文尚未公布，但黎當然想知道法律內容，擔心會否對法治、人權和新聞機構運作有影響。控方追問，《蘋果》報導國安法新聞時，會採取什麼角度。陳說：「都係擔心會唔會影響法治、人權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問，《蘋果》有否在2020年5月至7月期間，即在《國安法》未生效之前舉行過會議。陳稱不肯定有否特地召開會議，還是有在恆常會議處理過相關議題，而她印象中黎智英並沒有出席這些會議。不過她補充，《蘋果》當時「都係重視呢單新聞」，要做好多配套。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英開設個人twitter帳戶後要求陳沛敏每日提供帖文主意&quot;&gt;黎智英開設個人Twitter帳戶後要求陳沛敏每日提供帖文主意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英在2020年5月22日傳送一段語音訊息給陳沛敏：「我依家開咗個 Twitter 呢都幾哄動，都幾哄動吓，你可唔可以每日就住一啲新聞有啲 idea，你每日傳一個 Twitt 我呢，傳一個 sentence 我呢，好唔好啊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，多不多人知道黎開設 Twitter 帳戶？陳表示：「我諗，都幾多人知道。」控方又問黎有否在《蘋果》內部公布開設帳戶，陳則指：「我諗冇正式公布囉」，她亦理解黎僅是以個人名義開設自己的 Twitter 帳戶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏傳送人大政協委員撐國安法合照-提議賣港賊制裁名單&quot;&gt;陳沛敏傳送人大政協委員撐國安法合照 提議「賣港賊，制裁名單？」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2020年5月23日的訊息，陳沛敏向黎智英傳送一張人大政協委員的合照，相中眾人手持「支持國安立法 護航一國兩制」橫額，陳並稱：「Will they be on the list?」，黎問：「What do you mean? Thanks」，陳回覆：「賣港賊，制裁名單？」，黎表示：「I see. Good suggest.」陳續表示：「張相和唐英年的發言 disgusted many Hong Kong people」，黎其後表示：「I’ve already put them on my Twitter: should US government put these people (on) the sanction list?」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，黎應該有將相關字句放在 Twitter，不過「其實我冇乜成日去睇佢嘅 Twitter」。她解釋，黎在語音訊息中要求她找一些新聞熱話，供他在個人 Twitter 發布，「咁我咪應佢要求，將好多網民、好多討論嘅新聞 send 畀佢囉。」控方問「賣港賊」是否陳所形容的熱話，陳確認，並稱：「所以我（在訊息中）話（政協委員相片）令到好多香港人生厭呀咁樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示黎智英同日的 Twitter 帖文，寫有「Should US government put them on the sanction list? #MagnitskyAct」。陳確認黎有採納她的意見，但她補充：「不過我都冇畀過完整句子佢吖」，當時也沒有想過「Magnitsky Act」（馬格尼茨基法）而且她並沒有參與發布相關 Twitter 帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏不同意黎智英以蘋果名義發起一人一信救香港&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：不同意黎智英以《蘋果》名義發起「一人一信救香港」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指《蘋果》於2020年5月24日頭版發起「一人一信救香港」行動，問這是誰的主意。陳指這是黎的主意，因為在登報前一日（5月23日），他突然提出這意念，而陳在接近中午時份才知道同事正著手處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，當天她特地提早回到公司，找黎智英和時任社長張劍虹了解情況，「因為對於呢件事，我覺得⋯⋯我唔係好認同，我認為佢（黎）唔應該以《蘋果日報》嘅名義發起一人一信行動，咁我就覺得唔適當囉。」因此她提早回公司，去「搞清楚係咪真係要咁做」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱她曾與黎智英和張劍虹一同討論，「我就表達唔係好適合咁做啦，不過黎生表現得好堅定要做呢樣嘢。我話既然係咁，黎生點解唔用自己嘅名義去做？啫係你可以用你個人名義，喺《蘋果日報》賣頭版廣告，而唔係好似用《蘋果日報》名義去發起一人一信行動。後尾都係冇接受到我意見啦。」陳之後有找張劍虹單獨討論，「我感覺上張生都唔係話好熱衷做呢件事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎智英如何回應陳的反對意見？陳指：「佢話咁做先有用囉」。控方追問黎想做到什麼？陳表示以她的理解，當時要國安法立法，所以黎想發起「一人一信」，使時任美國總統特朗普關注這件事，從而做一些事去阻止《國安法》，不過黎並沒有詳細交代想特朗普做什麼行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃之鋒網上批評一人一信-黎智英稱縱使身邊有人反對都係要咁做&quot;&gt;黃之鋒網上批評「一人一信」 黎智英稱縱使身邊有人反對「都係要咁做」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又補充，黎決定在5月24日《蘋果》登報之後，「佢就跟住有繼續登，不過唔係A1，而係其他版。」她記得網上有聲音，例如黃之鋒對「一人一信」行動有負評，「啫係唔認同做法，批評黎生嘅做的啦，咁我就 WhatsApp 咗（相關帖文）畀黎生，等佢唔好再做呢件事」，不過「黎生嘅反應係，佢身邊都有人反對呢件事，但佢都係要咁做㗎喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示相關 WhatsApp 對話，陳向黎傳送黃之鋒帖文截圖，並稱「FYI」，黎回覆表示不認同黃的看法，現時已沒有其他方法對付中共，任何事情可以幫助到他們的話都應該去做，他知道李柱銘也不認同行動，但是在危機面前他們不能裝作謹慎和聰明，勇敢是唯一出路：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What he says doesn’t matter. That’s a very different view of looking at US and the matter at hand. I don’t agree with him, whatever we can secure to help us we must use now. I know a lot of people don’t agree with this including Martin, but now is time crisis we can’t pretend to be careful and clever. The only way is to be brave! There’s no other way to deal with CCP now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，她剛才提及黎身邊都有人反對「一人一信」，是否就是指李柱銘。陳確認。控方續問，為何行動仍然登報？陳指：「因為黎生堅持囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英提供外國團體新聞稿-蘋果其後報導-附梁家傑與裴倫德合照&quot;&gt;黎智英提供外國團體新聞稿 《蘋果》其後報導 附梁家傑與裴倫德合照&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，黎智英於2020年6月3日向陳沛敏發送一份「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, IPAC）的新聞稿。《蘋果》於2020年6月5日刊出報導，題為〈斥強權港版國安法踐踏人權 9議會結盟強硬抗中共〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指報導下方有一張前公民黨立法會議員梁家傑與IPAC執行總監裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）的合照。陳表示不記得當時循什麼途徑獲得此照片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英提及天安門母親獲獎新聞-陳沛敏指已見報&quot;&gt;黎智英提及天安門母親獲獎新聞 陳沛敏指已見報&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示2020年6月4日，黎智英向陳沛敏發送4則訊息，關於六四受難者家屬團體「天安門母親」獲頒發「國際婦女勇氣獎」，以及時任國務卿蓬佩奧會見六四倖存者；黎又指蓬佩奧團隊中人希望《蘋果》予以報導，因他們擔心親北京媒體的壟斷導致香港看不到上述新聞。陳則回覆「今日已見報，thanks」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏庭上指，因為當天報紙是在前一天準備的，而黎以為《蘋果》未有報導這幾宗新聞，「但其實我哋有呢幾單新聞。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英向陳沛敏傳送共和黨參議員言論-後來在報導被引用&quot;&gt;黎智英向陳沛敏傳送共和黨參議員言論 後來在報導被引用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英曾向陳沛敏傳送共和黨參議員魯比奧（Marco Rubio）的言論：「How we respond to the People’s Republic of China and the Communist Party’s attempt to reshape the globe is the defining foreign policy question of our time. This challenge is much greater than any individual country, administration, or political party, which is why democracies worldwide need to come together as we are doing today.」，並指「看是否需要在文中加上去。謝謝。」陳庭上表示曾把上述訊息轉發給同事處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示2020年6月5日《蘋果》報紙文章〈蓬佩奧與抗爭者「並肩」〉，載有時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧與六四前學運領袖王丹、作家蘇曉康、李蘭菊和李恒青的合照。報導提到：「美國國會及行政部門中國問題委員會昨發表聲明，呼籲中國公佈六四死者及失蹤者人數，允許人民公開討論研究六四事件以及立即無條件釋放政治犯。委員會共同主席麥戈文（James McGovern）聯同另一名共同主席、共和黨籍參議員魯比奧（Marco Rubio）在聲明中指出，他們也與包括香港人、藏人、維族等受壓迫人士站在一起。」陳沛敏確認魯比奧的言論有被引用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏攬炒巴起初因網上討論區言論而成名-2019年起始見報&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：「攬炒巴」起初因網上討論區言論而成名 2019年起始見報&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年6月15日「隔牆有耳」欄目，題為「中共威脅全球民主自由 攬炒巴加入國際聯軍反抗」，並指報導中提及IPAC，問陳這與黎的訊息有否關連。陳指沒有關連。控方又問IPAC是否當時一項熱話，陳指不算是熱話，但是當時IPAC剛剛成立，所以會有較多報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問「攬炒巴」是否一項熱話。陳則指這個人在2019年起才開始見報，因為最初他在網上討論區發言而成名，亦曾發起全球登報計劃，傳媒包括《蘋果》也有報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年6月18日的《蘋果》頭版，題為〈要求放緩清場 免人踩人受傷 社工阻差辦公重囚一年〉，關於社工劉家棟被裁判官蘇文隆裁定阻差辦公罪成，判囚一年。下方配稿題為「蘇官曾指7.21白衣人『勇敢面對』」。陳沛敏指報導角度是「對於判刑有爭議性」，公眾及社工界就認為監禁一年是過重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;高層開國安法應變群組討論記者擔心-惟黎智英非群組成員&quot;&gt;高層開「國安法應變」群組討論記者擔心 惟黎智英非群組成員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，2020年6月22日「國安法應變委員會」WhatsApp 群組成立，而黎智英並不是群組成員之一。陳指群組是由張劍虹提出設立，黎沒有被加入群組，是因為「咁可以自由啲討論」，「因為有咗佢（黎）嘅意見喺度，變咗佢嘅意思會主導晒所有人嘅意見，變咗唔係討論嘅場地。」而且張劍虹有事想與黎商討之前，會先在群組收集大家意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示群組截圖，時任《蘋果》總編輯羅偉光傳送一則訊息：「各位同事，黎生與編採部管理層就記者落 byline 有最終決定」，有4個情況必須寫下記者署名，分別是現場直播、人物專訪、專題報導，以及「自己故」，包括報紙頭版和要聞版面；如有特殊情況，同事需向主管提出。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》總編輯 羅偉光&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏解釋，當時因應《國安法》即將實施，有同事提到記者署名的問題，有些新聞圖片可能含有觸犯《國安法》的內容，如果標註攝影記者的姓名，同事會擔心可能招致法律後果，但另一方面，有部份同事覺得有需要標註他們的姓名。因為同事有這樣的擔心，所以高層有需要處理，「簡單啲嚟講，係令佢哋冇咁擔心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，黎對這方面的討論並不知情，「我當時唔覺得要向黎生報告，同埋就算係要報告，都唔係我去報告囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安法生效當天頭版標題惡法生效-兩制蓋棺-陳沛敏根據黎的意見構思&quot;&gt;國安法生效當天頭版標題〈惡法生效 兩制蓋棺〉 陳沛敏：根據黎的意見構思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月1日國安法生效，《蘋果》當日頭版以〈惡法生效 兩制蓋棺 泛民7.1繼續抗爭〉為標題。控方問這標題是誰的主意。陳則指是時任執行總編輯林文宗和其他構思標題的編輯，「可以話係根據黎生一路對《國安法》的意見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問陳何以得知黎對國安法的意見，陳指黎曾經撰寫相關文章，或者在一些公司場合，包括「飯盒會」，黎曾談及《國安法》生效之後，傳媒工作會很困難、一國兩制「玩完」之類的說話。控方問公司場合是否還包括《蘋果》週年慶典，陳表示不肯定，「但嗰時氛氛係比較擔心係咪可以做落去，黎生有就當時士氣去講啲鼓勵說話。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指新聞圖片佔頭版一半-加上標題大字-陳沛敏確認設計為吸引讀者&quot;&gt;官指新聞圖片佔頭版一半 加上標題大字 陳沛敏確認設計為吸引讀者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰留意到，7.1頭版報導並沒有任何記者署名，惟根據「國安法應變委員會」群組發布的指引，頭版必須有記者署名，問陳為何會這樣。陳回答，指引有提及如果同事不願意落記者署名，可以向主管提出，由主管決定。李官問，即是7.1頭版的記者獲主管批准不標註姓名，陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又指，國旗的相片幾乎佔了頭版一半頁面，而文字只佔一半，問陳為何如此做法。陳指「如果係大新聞我哋都會咁設計」，尤其是當新聞圖片「好靚」、有象徵意義，「喺新聞攝影上有啲意象」，便會放大新聞圖片。陳又指，一般人經過報檔看到報紙頭版時，並不會細閱內文，通常都會買完報紙之後才會細閱內文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問，將新聞圖片放大，加上「惡法生效 兩制蓋棺」八個大字，這設計是否吸引讀者注意的方式？陳回答是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英冀英文版「打國際線」、若政府打壓或遭譴責甚至制裁&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/N4TAStB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（20日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第29日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。庭上提及《蘋果》高層於2020年5月開始籌備英文版，陳沛敏憶述黎智英曾提及「如果有美國政治人物訂閱，咁就好喇」，希望英文版能為《蘋果》起到保護作用，當《蘋果》遭受打壓，國際社會都會提供支持，從而向政府施壓，「可能言論上會有譴責，或者採取一啲行動去制裁啦。」群組訊息亦顯示，黎曾表示英文版只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞，做具有深度的報導，「貴精不貴多」；黎又指不需要向外國讀者呈現香港不同政治陣營的觀點，只需要集中在「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」、「黃營的普遍觀點」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方馮睎乾專欄提蘋果要做國際文宣線以增值&quot;&gt;控方：馮睎乾專欄提《蘋果》要做「國際文宣線」以「增值」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第八天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英於2020年5月10日設立群組「English news」，而陳沛敏是群組成員之一。陳確認，並指創立群組之前，黎曾經口頭上講過考慮推行英文新聞，但是沒有詳細說明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/x4QIy4o.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示群組訊息，黎稱：「今日馮睎乾提議出英譯新聞電子版諗得過，反正現在翻譯網站翻譯成本低而快。」控方問陳對馮睎乾文章內容有否印象，陳指大概記得馮在專欄文章中指英文新聞只有《南華早報》，而《蘋果日報》都可以做到英文新聞，以「打破當時得一間英文報紙嘅壟斷」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示馮睎乾於2020年5月10日的專欄文章《不撐蘋果的100萬人》，當中一段提到：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「蘋果救亡似乎只有兩個方向：一是增加訂閱量，吸納那100萬個潛在客戶，二是提供收費較高的訂閱選項，讓某些（不是一刀切加價）現有客戶多付點錢。但無論哪個方向，前提都是蘋果必須『增值』。根據我的網上觀察，以及讀者要求我反映的意見，『增值』主要有兩大方面：一是八卦式公義，二是國際文宣線。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏確認蘋果英文版方向是國際文宣線-黎智英冀美國政治人物訂閱&quot;&gt;陳沛敏確認《蘋果》英文版方向是「國際文宣線」 黎智英冀美國政治人物訂閱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，「國際文宣線」是否就是《蘋果》英文新聞的目標？陳回答：「係呢個方向，啫係為咗吸引國際關注香港發生咩事」，在她記憶中，黎曾提及這樣會為《蘋果》起到保護作用，若果國際社會有《蘋果》英文版的讀者，當《蘋果》遭受打壓，國際社會都會提供支持。被問到《蘋果》英文版有否特定國家對象，陳指「我諗譬如美國啦」，黎亦有提及過：「如果有美國政治人物訂閱，咁就好喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，高層一開始討論英文版做法時，她關心的是會否需要使用數頁實體報紙來刊登英文文章，但後來她理解黎似乎認為不需要印在報紙。以陳的理解，因為實體報紙只限於香港本地發行，平均每日約有6至7萬份，很難運送至外國發行，所以黎認為英文版不需要牽涉實體報紙，只需使用《蘋果》網站，可能是揀選一些中文文章來翻譯成英文，之後刊登在網站。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到，黎智英經常跟前社長張劍虹表達想揀選哪一類文章來翻譯，同事便會按照張的指示去揀選文章。被問到何以得知黎和張之間有就這方面溝通，陳指有時在群組看到相關訊息，張有時亦會轉達黎的說話，有時跟同事之間食飯，「吐苦水嘅時候又會講吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英冀英文版能做到打國際線效果&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英冀英文版能做到「打國際線」效果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示時任動新聞平台總監張志偉向群組發送的訊息：「老闆，張生，如是要外國讀者主動訂閱，我們英文版的 newsletter，即我們要做有效的宣傳，reach 到這班讀者，故我們要想好怎宣傳這事。而我們最終目標是打國際線，我建議我們可考慮在美、英主流報章，如 New York Times、Washington Post、英國金融時報等實體報章和網站落廣告，宣傳我們將會做 newsletter 訂閱，令外國讀者知道這事，從而 subscribe 我們 newsletter，就像連登仔在外國報章登廣告打國際線宣傳一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，「打國際線」是否設立英文版的「最終目標」？陳則指：「我理解黎生係想做到呢個效果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示時任《蘋果》總編輯羅偉光的訊息，他向群組提議，可邀請一些香港年輕人撰寫英文評論，例如曾捲入「世衞風波」的前香港電台記者 Yvonne Tong、身處美國的梁繼平，以及一些打「國際線戰線」的學生和「手足」，「讓這些香港年輕面孔面向世界，直接說香港情況。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏mark-simon較熟悉外國媒體-可協助宣傳英文版&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：Mark Simon較熟悉外國媒體 可協助宣傳英文版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英又在群組中提及：「我會叫 Mark 先搞好美國方面發放這消息的方法和渠道。」陳沛敏解釋，她估計黎的私人助理 Mark Simon 對外國媒體比較熟悉，因此他可以告訴外國媒體《蘋果》會籌辦英文版，以作宣傳。她表示，有時見到 Mark Simon 接受外國媒體採訪，「由佢去代表黎生回應一啲關於黎生或黎生業務嘅嘢」，所以印象中 Mark Simon 較熟悉外國媒體。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏在群組傳送訊息：「除了翻譯，可否請人直接寫關於香港問題的英文評論。」陳在庭上解釋，她當時認為，既然要出錢聘請人翻譯文章，為何不邀請一些作者以英文撰寫文章。再者，她認為她所負責的實體報紙，讀者對象應該是香港本地人士，但如果英文版的對象是外國讀者的話，黎智英和張劍虹可以考慮為外國讀者度身訂造（tailor-made）而去撰寫一些文章，所以她不認為實體報紙要遷就外國的讀者，包括國際社會、美國公眾和政界人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到，後來黎在群組內表示要做多一些中國新聞，因此有負責中國新聞的同事加入群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英曾向mark-simon-表示想彭斯訂閱蘋果英文版&quot;&gt;黎智英曾向Mark Simon 表示想彭斯訂閱《蘋果》英文版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英於2020年5月10日向Mark Simon傳送訊息：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Mark, Imaging if we can get Mike Pence to subscribe to Apple Daily app! The publicity and respect it command would arouse much support for us. I know it’s almost impossible to pull it off. But can try? Thanks Jimmy”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏解釋，黎認為若果時任美國副總統彭斯都是《蘋果》英文版的讀者的話，會令英文版的知名度提高，「咁喺美國社會都會有好多人支持，以我嘅理解。」若果政府打壓《蘋果》的話，國際社會都會支持《蘋果》，從而向政府施壓，「可能言論上會有譴責，或者採取一啲行動去制裁啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英訊息稱英文版只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞&quot;&gt;黎智英訊息稱英文版只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英在群組中稱，他們不需要報導所有新聞，只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞，做具有深度的報導：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t news (need) all news, only those big enough for foreigners to be interested. That may not be an everyday item. Yes, in depth good quality items. Again the motto is 貴精不貴多！”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，黎所指外國人感興趣的大新聞是什麼意思。陳則認為是一些關於香港社會運動的新聞，不過當時社會運動已經沉寂，她記得後來黎有講過要多報導中國新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ejFGmHZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英訊息稱尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版即是尋求他們的支持&quot;&gt;黎智英訊息稱尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版即是尋求他們的支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英其後繼續在群組發送訊息，指尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版即是尋求他們的支持：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“By enlisting foreign leaders to subscribe to us is enlisting their support. They of course understand it and that’s why they would do it. Now is a good time to appeal to them when the English version is launched.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳確認，尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版是其中一個目標，除了外國政治人物之外，黎也希望外國的公眾人士也能訂閱《蘋果》英文版。她理解若果外國政治人物訂閱，會是一種表態，以示支持《蘋果》和黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指不需平衡報導不同陣營觀點-只需報導泛黃觀點&quot;&gt;黎智英指不需平衡報導不同陣營觀點 只需報導泛黃觀點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在群組中表示，不需要向外國讀者呈現不同陣營的觀點，只需要集中在「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」、「黃營的普遍觀點」：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When we choose writers we don’t have to think about giving foreigners a balanced view of what happens here of every different colors, we only concentrate in our Apple Daily HK view, a general view of the yellow side. In choosing further writers we need not choose Weijian Shan, who’s a friend of mine and a very popular writer about China in the west. But his view is all China on the positive side we don’t need. We are not trying to strike a balance but the point of view of the people on the side of protecting HK. This is the voice the world wants to know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問何謂「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」，陳回答指，根據黎的演譯，就是「偏黃陣營的觀點」。控方續問，《蘋果》有否實行到黎所說的集中在「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」，陳表示：「我相信有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問《蘋果》是否實行到黎所說不需要平衡報導，陳表示：「似乎係囉。」控方追問，《蘋果》英文版報導中央政府新聞時，會採取什麼角度，陳則指：「會係對中國比較批判啲嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英想英文版報導中美關係中國與國際之間互動&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英想英文版報導中美關係、中國與國際之間互動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，後來前《蘋果》主筆馮偉光被選做英文版的總編輯，應該是由他按照黎智英的準則去揀選文章來翻譯成英文。相關準則包括著重有關中國的新聞，或者「一啲佢（黎）覺得外國讀者會關注，啫唔係咁香港本地嘅嘢囉」，至於文章角度，「我諗都係有批判性。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》主筆 馮偉光，筆名「盧峯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到有什麼「唔係咁香港本地」的新聞例子，陳舉例指當年《蘋果》大篇幅報導沙中線醜聞，雖然獲得獎項，但是這不是黎認為能夠吸引國際關注的新聞。她理解黎想英文版報導中美關係、中國與國際之間互動，以及牽引到國際社會要關心的議題，而且正如黎早前提及要報導「偏黃」觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏蘋果比較支持和諒解示威者的處境-因普選訴求符合黎智英取態&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：《蘋果》比較支持和諒解示威者的處境 因普選訴求符合黎智英取態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示前動新聞平台總監張志偉的訊息：「老闆，張生，我想有一方法去打國際線，出我們的蘋果英文版內容，就是利用現成的 patreon 平台，代替我們自己去 send 出 newsletter」，張又指：「因我們今次打國際線，目的是發揮香港《蘋果日報》在外國的影響力和話語權，訂閱人頭和收入同樣重要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，《蘋果》只是一份報紙，為何會涉及「打國際線」？陳則認為張志偉僅使用了社運人士所使用的字眼，但她不能代張解讀原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問《蘋果》有否參與「打國際線」，若有的話，會是以什麼形式參與。陳表示：「我諗我唔會用『參與』」，不過當時《蘋果》的態度「會係比較支持和諒解示威者的處境，立場係比較支持佢哋嘅訴求」，例如有訴求提到普選，而這符合黎一向支持民主的取態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問為何《蘋果》比較支持示威者。陳指，除了上述提及示威者部份訴求符合黎的立場之外，在七一佔領立法會事件之後，黎想《蘋果》報導示威者心聲，「佢嗰時都直接講個動機係運動可以持續落去，我估係以咁嘅方式去支持？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，當示威者談及「國際線」時，意思是想國際人士關注香港情況，若果得到外國支持，運動會有較大成功機會，「如果佢哋（示威者）受到鎮壓，國際社會會出聲呀咁。」她理解這種「國際支持」，與黎開頭籌辦英文版時，提及想得到外國的支持和得到保護，「我理解個邏輯係一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英不贊成用patreon-並指美國政治人物訂閱對政治庇護更重要&quot;&gt;黎智英不贊成用Patreon 並指美國政治人物訂閱對政治庇護更重要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月12日的群組訊息，黎智英回應張志偉的 Patreon 提議，稱：「Patreon 的問題是與蘋果日報隔離，我們主要目的是外國人撐蘋果日報，尤其美國政治人物訂閱蘋果對我們的政治庇護更重要，我仍然認為英文版有需要設在我們 app 內。而設 app 內時間不用太久。等回來我處談談。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏確認記憶中《蘋果》最終沒有使用 Patreon 來發布英文版文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英提議翻譯桑普林本利和李兆富文章&quot;&gt;黎智英提議翻譯桑普、林本利和李兆富文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前社長張劍虹曾在群組中表示：「林本利我們可以翻譯他的社評」、「楊社長介紹 Steve Vines、Michael Chugani 和一個叫 Albert Wun 的美籍華人」，其後黎智英表示：「以上可加桑普、林本利和 Simon Lee。Mark Simon and Mark Clifford 也認識一些本地住寫英文的 KOL 給我們寫。每天平均有兩篇英文稿就差不多了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏表示記得 Steve Vines 曾在英文報紙工作過，亦有寫過一些評論文章；Michael Chugani（禇簡寧）亦有在英文報紙工作過，其後在電台擔任主持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及桑普文章的角度，陳指「都係對政府比較有批判性」。林本利則是經濟學家，比較多寫經濟分析。至於 Simon Lee 即是李兆富，陳形容他「好崇尚市場經濟，反對政府干預，覺得要由私人市場去做」，即是崇尚「大市場，小政府」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏憶述被捕後-同事擔心公司會否倒閉或更多人被捕&quot;&gt;陳沛敏憶述被捕後 同事擔心公司會否倒閉或更多人被捕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎訊息中提及的 Mark Clifford 是壹傳媒集團的非執行董事。陳確認，但她表示當時並未留意 Mark Clifford。她憶述，當年一些董事被警方拘捕之後，會計部很徬徨，如果他們不獲准保釋，便未能簽署支票出稿費，後來公司找黎智英和張劍虹委任她自己和羅偉光，「到時有咩事都可以簽支票」，但陳被委任之後，記憶中董事局便沒有再開過會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，她不是因為獲委任為董事而知道 Mark Clifford 這個人，而是因為在報紙上看到宣傳黎智英 Live Chat 節目的全版廣告，當中顯示 Mark Clifford 會出席節目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳略顯激動地提到，最深印象是她在2021年6月17日被捕之後，獲得警方擔保出來時，因為公司財產被凍結，同事都擔心公司會否倒閉，若果倒閉會否賠償到欠薪和遣散費，或者擔心會否再有其他同事被捕。而她當時已向公司辭職，「我係咪可以代表同事問董事局，《蘋果日報》係咪應該結束呢？」陳表示：「我嘅意見係要結束啦」，因為當有同事問她「我哋繼續做落去，會唔會畀人拉？當同事咁問我，我做唔到呢個擔保」，因要詢問董事局。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官此時打斷，指這是後來發生的事件，希望按目前時序來作供，待稍後談到2021年6月時才詳細交代。陳回應，她交代上述事件，目的是想講「去到2021年嗰個位，我先知道 Mark Clifford。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏馮偉光曾做英語媒體-是主理英文版適合人選&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：馮偉光曾做英語媒體 是主理英文版適合人選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示群組訊息，黎智英表示：「我想 English news 我們需要一個人主理，例如挖大陸任志強等先進人士寫的文章翻譯，或將『方方日記』的精髓每天翻譯一小段作為花絮等，不斷為英文版構思些做法令其姿態生動是必須的。劍虹、沛敏和偉光請你們商量選一個人出來主理。這人可以是外面的人，總之對大陸和本港熟悉和英文好，一般學識水平高便可。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏指，英文版最後由馮偉光主理，因他長期替《蘋果》撰寫社論，知道《蘋果》的風格，又有在英語媒體工作的經驗，所以是適合的人選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏憶述黎智英稱當蘋果英文版與南早不同便能引人訂閱&quot;&gt;陳沛敏憶述黎智英稱當《蘋果》英文版與《南早》不同便能引人訂閱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指訊息紀錄顯示，陳在2020年5月13日收到一條語音訊息，而她其後回覆「收到，已聽」。陳確認該語音訊息是一次會議的錄音，由於她沒有出席該次會議，所以同事事後傳送會議錄音給她。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上閱畢錄音謄本之後，控方問她會否記得黎想要哪一種中國新聞。陳指黎提到內地維權新聞，而香港新聞則想繼續關注警暴、自由民主等議題。她稱記得黎講過，「（當《蘋果》）變咗同《南華早報》好唔同嘅時候，啲人就會訂閱《蘋果日報》喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 6 and 7 February, the UK and France launched the Pall Mall Process (PMP), a dialogue dedicated to tackling the proliferation and irresponsible use of commercial cyber intrusion capabilities. The initiative brought together government representatives and stakeholders from different sectors for the first day of discussions. It also marked the launch of a multi-stakeholder declaration on the topic – the “Pall Mall Declaration” – which, among other things, proposes an initial list of principles that could guide future work on the topic (accountability, precision, oversight and transparency), as well as working definitions that could support a shared vocabulary to address different types of services and technologies. What is more, both governments have already announced that the PMP will formally reconvene in 2025 for its second meeting in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the applaudable initiative, as governments come together on the road to Paris 2025, the key point will be to observe how the PMP unfolds. Will it speak to a broader pool of countries? Are stakeholders going to be involved in and continue to provide inputs to the discussions? Will companies providing some of the intrusive tools be invited for future – even if private – discussions? Ultimately, what does success look like for this nascent process, and for whom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this collaborative piece, we bring together experts who have engaged in the PMP and attended the 6 February meeting. We invited them to reflect on what the PMP needs to consider if it is to be a sustained and action-based dialogue. These reflections are not exhaustive, but highlight some of the pressing concerns facing this agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-does-the-pmp-fit-in-and-who-fits-into-it&quot;&gt;Where Does the PMP Fit In, and Who Fits into It?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;louise-marie-hurel-rusi&quot;&gt;Louise Marie Hurel, RUSI&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PMP is the latest chapter in a series of unfolding initiatives on this topic. In March 2023, during the US-led Summit for Democracy, 11 countries issued a statement recognising the threat posed by the misuse of commercial spyware and the need for domestic and international controls to curb the proliferation of these tools. Individual countries have also been vocal about the use of the technology, such as when the US issued an Executive Order prohibiting the use of commercial spyware that poses a risk to national security. Private-sector groups, such as the Tech Accord, have published a list of industry principles to curb the threat of cyber mercenaries (the developers, sellers and/or resellers of these tools). Civil society organisations have launched campaigns, investigations and joint statements highlighting the disproportionate effects and human rights violations of many of these intrusive tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does the PMP fit into all of this? While the US view has purposefully focused on spyware, the initiative by the UK and France broadens the scope. Instead of focusing on the most intrusive and abusive technology, it seeks to cover a range of lawful, responsible, unlawful and irresponsible uses, answering questions such as: “What happens when a malicious actor uses pentesting tools and techniques to illegally enter a system?” In so doing, the PMP is able to speak politically to a broader range of stakeholders, instead of arriving at the negotiation table with a naming and shaming over “infamous” cases such as Pegasus. It is also able to engage with the whole gamut of businesses engaging in the supply chain of tools that range from legitimate to contested uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still unclear whether the political strategy of broadening the scope will result in greater engagement in the long run, or whether the debate will become more complex than purposeful. To address these risks, states will need to focus on concrete cases across the developer, supplier, user and targets spectrum of application – and possibly in different regions. Assessing the regulatory mechanisms, risk management procedures, accountability frameworks and prevention strategies that can be implemented for each segment will be crucial, as will the need for regional diversity and dialogue. If states or stakeholders in different regions do not feel represented, this might lead to withdrawal or disengagement. Building regional and/or thematic co-ownership in intersessional dialogues with states and stakeholders that are more willing to discuss the issue will be paramount for progress. Whether there needs to be a track for state responsibility and proliferation as it relates to the role of the private sector is yet to be seen, as the authors below also highlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legitimate-use-buzzword-or-legitimate-concern&quot;&gt;Legitimate Use: Buzzword or Legitimate Concern?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;katharina-sommer-ncc-group&quot;&gt;Katharina Sommer, NCC Group&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is stark how often participants mentioned that efforts to tackle the proliferation and irresponsible use of cyber capabilities should not impede their legitimate use. Representatives recognised the need for the cyber security industry and sector to exist, as well as states’ right to protect their citizens. But beyond high-level rhetoric, there was little progress towards defining what legitimate use entailed, or the criteria that should be applied to testing whether any development or use (of offensive capabilities) was, indeed, legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dual-use aspect of cyber security tools and practice is a perennial challenge, one that has not thus far found a satisfactory solution. Attempts in cybercrime legislation to distinguish legitimate and illegitimate activities by virtue of “authorisation/permission” are hardly fit for purpose in the 21st century, and looking at intent or motivation as a key differentiator comes with its own set of challenges. What will be important in the dialogue that follows over the coming months is to ensure that efforts to define legitimate use truly involve multiple stakeholders, including those from the private sector and the cyber security industry, whose (legitimate) security research and identification of software vulnerabilities, as well as their use of offensive cyber security tools – from penetration testing frameworks to de-fanged exploits as part of red team engagements – serve the purpose of improving organisations’ cyber resilience, and should not be negatively impacted by the PMP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, one of the most meaningful contributions during the discussions described what was needed to tackle the challenges as a mosaic. There is no silver-bullet solution, much as we all would like one. It is crucial to accept that the solution will ultimately be a patchwork of different, smaller solutions undertaken by different actors across the ecosystem, all of which will make an incremental contribution to solving the cyber capabilities conundrum. The challenge for the French and British governments leading this process will be to come up with the umbrella that brings together and coordinates these different solutions into something that makes sense and looks coherent – and not just for the PR purpose of claiming success at the end of the process in Paris next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;state-responsibility-in-developing-and-using-commercial-cyber-capabilities&quot;&gt;State Responsibility in Developing and Using Commercial Cyber Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;aude-géry-geode&quot;&gt;Aude Géry, GEODE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of states’ ambitions to restrict the development, use and transfer of commercial cyber intrusion capabilities, there are already a number of international obligations that can serve as a basis for tackling the proliferation and irresponsible use of these capabilities. As such, the PMP does not operate in a legal vacuum. And because international law in itself provides a framework for accountability – in particular general international law, international human rights law and even cybercrime law – we can already identify guidelines for the establishment of such an accountability system. These may differ depending on whether the state acts as a client or regulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is critical that the Pall Mall Process avoids over-simplified, knee-jerk responses to abuses of cyber security tools and calls for prohibiting them&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the state acts as a client, existing international law could provide insight on how to develop procurement or use policies. For example, one could imagine the introduction of procedures to assess the impact of the use of certain capabilities on the target and its environment, as well as on the stability of cyberspace. Where the state acts as a regulator, the implementation of the right to a fair trial seems to be one of the most pressing concerns in order to provide victims with adequate remedies. When companies under the jurisdiction of a state are involved in cases of apparent violation of international law, states should systematically initiate administrative and criminal investigations to identify potential violations by the state as a regulator and the company and its subcontractors. Following the practice of the UK courts, further consideration should also be given to states’ sovereign immunity. If we focus on end-use as the subject of regulation, we quickly realise that the foundations for an accountability framework are already in place. So, it is time to build on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connecting-the-dots-un-norms-and-the-pmp&quot;&gt;Connecting the Dots? UN Norms and the PMP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In two places, the Pall Mall Declaration refers to the “framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace”. This is an evolving framework that has been developed through the decisions and outputs of successive UN groups of governmental experts (GGEs), notably the agreement that international law applies to the conduct of states in cyberspace and the complementary articulation of 11 voluntary, peacetime norms. These norms and the GGE’s determination about the applicability of international law have subsequently been repeatedly endorsed by all member states at the UN General Assembly. In 2021, the most recent GGE provided guidance on norms implementation. Both the norms and the applicability of international law are important areas of discussion within the current UN forum for international cyber issues, the Open-ended Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Declaration draws particular attention to three of the norms: norm (e), on respecting human rights and relevant resolutions of the UN Human Rights Council; norm (i), on ensuring the integrity of supply chain security and preventing the proliferation of malicious ICT tools and techniques and the use of harmful hidden functions; and norm (j), on responsibility reporting of vulnerabilities and associated information sharing. It is not hard to see the connection between these norms and the types of commercial cyber intrusion capabilities that the PMP will focus on. The framework is also referenced later in the Declaration, in the paragraph which identifies accountability as one of four pillars of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is significant because the norms, and the framework more broadly, often come under criticism for being too vague or too poorly understood and applied outside of the cyber diplomacy community. By drawing a line between the framework and this emerging process, with its focus on specific cyber threats and its engagement with a broad range of stakeholders, the Declaration underscores the relevance of the norms while also demonstrating how they can be applied in practice. Also significant is the encouragement given to PMP participants to take appropriate action to hold states to account when their activity is inconsistent with international human rights law, and to hold non-state actors accountable in domestic legal systems as appropriate. The PMP has the potential to give a boost to broader cyber governance efforts, especially if it can formulate detailed and specific objectives and actions; however, it will be important to maintain complementarity and synergy with relevant UN processes. Moreover, given the challenges non-governmental stakeholders face with participating in UN processes, the PMP should prioritise active engagement with the private sector, academia and civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Montreux Document and the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers (IcoC) – along with its oversight mechanism, the International Code of Conduct Association (IcoCA) – have been pivotal in translating international humanitarian and human rights law obligations into practical, actionable standards for private security companies. This approach provides a valuable multi-stakeholder template for managing cyber intrusion capabilities. Similar to the way these documents delineate ethical guidelines for private security operations, a parallel framework could be established for cyber intrusion activities, distinguishing between those that respect human rights (such as legitimate law enforcement and anti-terrorism measures by governments) and those that do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar fashion to the Montreux Document and IcoC/IcoCA processes, a multi-stakeholder governance framework for cyber intrusion capabilities would require a clear set of standards and principles specifically tailored to the realm of cyber security. It would articulate the boundaries of ethical cyber intrusions, ensuring that they are in line with international law, especially concerning human rights. Just as the Montreux Document addresses state responsibilities and IcoC provides guidelines for private security companies, this cyber framework would address both state and non-state actors engaged in cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the framework could establish robust mechanisms for accountability and oversight, similar to IcoCA’s role in monitoring compliance with the IcoC. This would not only ensure adherence to the established standards but also foster trust among international actors and the public, enhancing the legitimacy of state actions in cyberspace. By establishing clear standards and oversight mechanisms, a governance framework for the responsible use of cyber intrusion capabilities would clearly define and promote ethical cyber operations that respect human rights, differentiating them from those that do not and thereby promoting a more responsible, rights-respecting and stable cyberspace environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proliferation and abuse of cyber security tools and spyware is not new. As the problem grows in scope, scale and negative impact, so too does the complexity of potential responses. So, I am heartened to see the UK and France taking an approach with the PMP that not only brings more than 30 governments together, but also includes the private sector, civil society and academia. The recent meeting in London represented an important stake in the ground, gathering voices from all these communities together to advance a nuanced understanding of the problem and to start discussions around potential responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, this will be a process, and I doubt that a resolution will be reached quickly or easily given the different dynamics and priorities at play for various stakeholders. Yet, I am encouraged by a few factors in the conversation so far. Firstly, there is an important emphasis on the realities of the harms being perpetrated and the human factors driving this discussion. We must not lose sight of this aspect as we move forward through the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, there has been a solid acknowledgement of the importance and value of security research and legitimate cyber security tools. It is critical that the process avoids over-simplified, knee-jerk responses to abuses of these activities and calls for prohibiting them. Such a move would leave society far more exposed to cyber threats and could even strengthen the black market for vulnerabilities and exploits as researchers seek a payday they would otherwise get from more respectable avenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The proliferation of intrusive and disruptive commercial cyber tools is arguably a microcosm of a broader “clash of governance” that has come to be a defining feature of the 21st century&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is an appreciation that there are vendors who want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. I worked for one such vendor for many years, and we strove to find ways to create greater accountability, oversight and transparency around our relevant sales, research and product development practices. I believe other vendors will do likewise if provided with a clear set of activities that can be undertaken without crippling the business. I hope this will form part of the work that comes out of the PMP in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch of the PMP can be welcomed as a diplomatic success. With 25 states and regional organisations signaling their willingness to work on defining clearer rules for the legitimate use of cyber intrusive capabilities and to tackle their proliferation on the commercial market, the UK and France managed to deliver two important diplomatic outcomes. First, confirming the interest of a diverse group of states, including those beyond the usual group of “like-minded countries” – in focusing on this difficult but important issue in a dedicated process. Second, they extended the topic from commercial spyware – already dealt with in other initiatives such as the US-led joint statement of March 2023 – to the larger market empowering the irresponsible use of cyber intrusive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both achievements are a good start. But the danger would be to keep navigating in comfortable processual waters instead of actually solving the problems the initial declaration has laid out. At a time when the proliferation of international summits, processes and initiatives is in and of itself threatening the efficiency of states’ efforts to secure a free, peaceful and stable cyberspace, it is even more important to identify clear intermediary goals if the PMP is to become a true success. Some baseline suggestions can be made in this regard, building on the experience of other processes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define a clear roadmap towards the French-hosted Pall Mall meeting in early 2025. This should especially include intermediary meetings throughout 2024 to identify possible consensual outcomes in early 2025, as well as key challenges to be addressed in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on clarifying legitimate uses with concrete use cases in mind. Before discussing any non-proliferation guideline or framework, participating states should focus on clarifying the uses of cyber intrusive capabilities that they consider legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leverage existing multistakeholder platforms and instruments. Building on existing frameworks and platforms such as the Cybersecurity Tech Accord or the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace will ensure widespread and meaningful participation of the stakeholder community, while avoiding reinventing the wheel in Pall Mall meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no single “killswitch” solution to the overarching dilemma of offensive cyber tools. In a world where we cannot “airgap” our societies, solutions must necessarily be international.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of intrusive and disruptive commercial cyber tools is arguably a microcosm of a broader “clash of governance” that has come to be a defining feature of the 21st century. If domestic and international legislatures were computer programmes, one could say that their source code has been written over the course of centuries through the formation of laws and norms. From the late 20th century onwards, however, this system of governance has overlapped – and contended – with a new form of governance: computer code authored predominantly by researchers and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least 80 states are believed to have drawn on the wares of the growing offensive cyber industry to bolster their intrusion and surveillance capabilities. In 2017, rogue entities repurposed a leaked US National Security Agency exploit – EternalBlue – and launched the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks. In the case of WannaCry, the international community – including a potentially disoriented British government – were given a reprieve by Marcus Hutchins’ identification of a killswitch. Will we be so lucky next time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities is fraught with risk. The PMP is a distinct opportunity for the international community to learn from the past and prepare for the future. The road may be rocky, and we should expect difficult, earnest and forthright discussions. But these should be welcomed, not feared. There are times when agreeing to disagree can be a fruitful endeavour. In the meantime, like-minded states must use their existing domestic levers to apply pressure and create the foundation for new norms – including, for instance, export controls, blacklists and codes of conduct. Additionally, like-minded states must empower civil society organisations, the media and researchers to shed light on malpractice and unchecked proliferation. Recent pushback against international reporting on some malpractice in this sector highlights a trend among some members of the industry to penalise those who help to inform checks and balances. The “whole of society” adage in cyber security can seem cliché, but the endeavour to mitigate the excesses of cyber proliferation must be exactly that. Future generations are watching us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western discourse about Russia’s way of war has oscillated between emphasising the conventional and unconventional threat. Up until Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the emphasis was disproportionately on Russian unconventional warfare – the conduct of sabotage, subversion and destabilisation through undeclared Russian forces – carried out in the so-called “grey zone”. This has since shifted to the conventional threat that Russia poses to NATO. The problem with this is that Russia considers both conventional and unconventional military means to be tools of national power and applies them in combination. It is the conventional threat of escalation that deters retaliation against unconventional activity, thereby expanding the scope of what Russia can get away with. Conversely, it is the unconventional operations of the Russian special services that aim to set the conditions for the successful application of conventional military force. Both tool sets must be understood to appreciate the threat that Russia poses. Its unconventional efforts remain central to its theory of victory against Ukraine – and countering them is equally important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2023, the authors published a study of Russia’s unconventional operations targeting Ukraine directly, prior to and during the first year of the full-scale invasion. This mainly focused on the activities of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) in recruiting and managing agent networks in Ukraine, its planning for the establishment of an occupation administration, and the eventual counter-intelligence regime in the occupied territories that emerged after the failure of the original invasion plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report details Russia’s unconventional military activities outside Ukraine, including efforts to prepare for destabilisation in European countries, expeditionary operations in Africa to seize control of critical resources, and outreach to target audiences in the Middle East. Influence operations supported by information warfare and active measures exploited by agents of influence are core components of Russia’s unconventional warfare concepts. This topic is amply tracked and reported on by others. There is also much extant writing on Russia’s conduct of strategic intelligence collection by recruiting agents and penetrations in Western states. While acknowledging the significance of these wider activities, this report focuses on Russia’s military unconventional activities, with a particular spotlight on changes within the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (the GRU). Recent changes in this organisation suggest an expanding threat that must be prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s primary conclusions are that Russia’s special services actively seek to expand their capacity in several areas that pose strategic threats to NATO members. First, the GRU is restructuring how it manages the recruitment and training of special forces troops and is rebuilding the support apparatus to be able to infiltrate them into European countries. Second, the GRU has taken the Wagner Group’s functions in house and is aggressively pursuing the expansion of its partnerships in Africa with the explicit intent to supplant Western partnerships. Third, the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, is being used to build a broad network of influence among Chechen and Muslim populations in Europe and the Middle East, with the aim of contributing to the subversion of Western interests. These lines of effort should be countered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is divided into three chapters. Chapter I considers the establishment and growth of the GRU’s Special Activities Service, and the lines of effort being pursued to re-establish a support apparatus in Europe. Chapter II concerns the evolution of Russia’s so-called “Wagner Group”, its successor Expeditionary Corps, and the strategy for Russia’s expanding network of relationships in Africa. Chapter III examines Russia’s use of its Muslim minority for diplomacy in the Middle East and Europe and, specifically, the role of the Kadyrovtsy as a vector of Russian influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has a considerable body of material from the Soviet special services, including instruction manuals and operational reports that comprise an invaluable archive on the evolution of Soviet unconventional warfare techniques and structures. Furthermore, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, there remained close liaison between the Ukrainian and Russian special services until the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. This means that Ukraine has a unique set of insights into the working level of these organisations. This report draws on these archives, as well as on the body of scholarship on Russian unconventional operations. These materials clearly do not provide information on current Russian operations. The sources for the subsequent chapters are a combination of documents obtained from the Russian special services and reporting on the activities of Russian unconventional warfare elements, including human reporting observing Russian activities in Moldova, Mali, Sudan and further afield. The report also relies on interviews with the relevant official bodies in Ukraine and some European states, comparing data. Owing to the sensitivity of some of the materials, names of interviewees are not provided and interview times and locations are not specific. Many of the documents drawn upon are also described with a deliberate degree of vagueness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s most important conclusion is that Russia is using unconventional methods to expand its influence, evade containment, and destabilise and disrupt its adversaries – and is making progress in several directions. Countering these efforts requires an appreciation of the threat that extends beyond Ukraine and the active collaboration of those states that are being targeted. Russian methods are often unsophisticated and there is a litany of failures. Nevertheless, they persist, and so there is a requirement for sustained vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-violent-subversion-and-destabilisation&quot;&gt;I. Violent Subversion and Destabilisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violent subversion for the purposes of political destabilisation and even regime change has been a core element of Russian unconventional military operations since the Bolshevik coup of 1917. The very premise of Bolshevism as a political ideology was that the successful seizure of power, and later Moscow’s control over states, was unlikely to be achieved through popular revolution, but must instead be instigated by a disciplined and covert revolutionary vanguard. It was via these means that the Bolsheviks achieved their coup against the Russian Provisional Government in October 1917. It was also via these means that the Bolsheviks sought to export their revolution abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet intelligence services orchestrated an uprising in Hamburg in 1923 under the leadership of Hristofor Salnyn. In 1924, an uprising was organised under the leadership of Karl Trakmann in Estonia with the intention of overthrowing the government in Tallinn. That same year, Russian intelligence officers were instrumental in organising the Tatarbunary Uprising, which was intended to bring about a wider revolution across Romania after the establishment of the Bessarabian Soviet Republic. All of these efforts, and more besides, were preceded by sustained attempts at violent destabilisation, intended to create conditions of civic crisis that the revolutionary vanguard could exploit. These included acts of terrorism. For example, on 8 December 1920, an explosion in the Romanian Senate arranged by Soviet intelligence officer M Goldstein caused the deaths of the head of the Senate, General K Coanda, the minister of justice, D Grecanu, and several other senators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these efforts were largely unsuccessful, they spawned a body of theoretical literature in the Soviet Union that remains the foundations of the Russian theory of unconventional warfare. Notable texts from this period include Philip Anulov’s Armed Uprising, Armed Uprising by August Neuberg (the nom de plume of August Gellis), P Karatigin’s Guerilla Warfare: Initial Experience of Tactical Research, and M Drobov’s Small War: Guerilla Warfare and Sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the uprisings of the 1920s failed, largely because there was insufficient public support and a too concerted official response to the attempts. Thus, as the Soviet school of unconventional warfare evolved, greater emphasis was placed on the interrelationship between subversion through propaganda and human intelligence and its exploitation through violent destabilisation. The KGB’s Major General Yuri Drozdov summarised this interdependency in what became known within the Russian special services as the “Drozdov Binomial”. This argued that “the success of a HUMINT [human intelligence]-combat operation in modern conditions depends on a combination of two factors: an illegal intelligence operative plus a combat group (оперативно-боевая группа)”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which the vanguard theory of revolution propounded by the Bolsheviks remains at the core of the identity of Russian unconventional warfare practitioners is perhaps captured in the writings of the Strugatsky brothers, whose Noom universe proposes a cast of “progressors” infiltrating less-developed societies to guide them on the true path. It is no coincidence that the KGB infiltration of opposition movements in Eastern Europe, launched in 1968, was codenamed Operation Progress. The consistent features of the Soviet methodology are: elite capture through the recruitment of agents within a faction of a state’s political elite; the use of information operations and subversion to create political destabilisation; and escalation through violence to create a crisis through which Russian allies can seize power. Probably the best-known example of this process was Operation Storm-333 in Afghanistan in 1979, when GRU and KGB special forces assassinated President Hafizullah Amin to be replaced by the Soviet client Babrak Karmal. The centrality of HUMINT to even tactical special operations remains extant Russian doctrine, codified in the still-classified Manual for the Combat Use of Formations and Units of Special Purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GRU unit responsible for carrying out these operations is the 161 Intelligence Specialists Training Centre (currently Центр подготовки специалистов специального назначения; previously Центр подготовки специалистов разведки), hereafter the 161 Centre or Unit 29155. The 161 Centre was established in 1963 and brought together both human intelligence and special forces personnel. This duality of skills was exemplified by the first head of the centre, Major General Nikolay Patrakhaltsev, who started his career in special reconnaissance units but subsequently worked in both the legal and illegal stations of the GRU in Hungary, Slovenia and Brazil. He was also a member of the Soviet military mission at the General Staff of the People’s Liberation Army of Yugoslavia. The continuity in approach of the Russian special services from the Soviet period can be observed in several recent operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the 161 Centre was responsible for cohering an attempted coup in Montenegro, aimed at preventing the country’s accession to NATO. Part of the operation’s premise was that organised criminal elements working as recruited agents under GRU control would provide the basis for the seizure of Montenegrin government buildings, allowing for a seizure of power by several opposition politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example of the process is Ukraine in February 2022. The idea behind Russia’s invasion was that protests would provide the basis for polarisation and thereafter escalation of fighting inside Ukraine, sparked by provocations. This would justify Russian military intervention, aided by collaborators within the Ukrainian government, clearing the path for Russian agents recruited inside the Ukrainian parliament and state to seize power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third example are two Russian attempts to destabilise Moldova, first during Victory Day on 9 May 2022, and the second in February 2023. Russia’s original plan had been to militarily occupy Moldova after concluding its operations in Ukraine. When the invasion of Ukraine failed, however, Moscow sought a mechanism to destabilise the Moldovan state. The first attempt was orchestrated by the Department of Operational Information within the FSB. The initial concept revolved around the generation of protests against the repression of Soviet military symbols during the Victory Day commemorations in 2022. Provocations during these demonstrations were to be used to drive an escalating cycle of violence in which politicians friendly to Russia could call for a change in leadership to stabilise the situation. This failed, partly because the poor performance of Russian arms in Ukraine at the time left several politicians otherwise friendly to Russia cautious about exacerbating the initial organised demonstrations. Plans were further disrupted when Moldovan authorities arrested former president Igor Dodon. Another attempt was planned for early 2023. This revolved around the protest movement of Ilan Shorr, an Israel-born Moldovan oligarch and politician, with orchestrated protests intended to create the conditions for provocation, justifying a violent response. Part of that violent response was to be organised by GRU officers from Unit 29155 working with recruited Serbian citizens (in particular, supporters of the Belgrade-based Partizan football club). The Moldovan authorities also disrupted this attempt. Ilan Shorr remains in Israel after fleeing there in 2019 with Moldova seeking his extradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These instances are important to highlight for two reasons. First, the consistency of the forms and methods show that this is a policy tool that Russia continues to employ. Second, all these attempts were unsuccessful. The reasons for failure were consistent: poor operational security leading to the exposure of the plan to domestic security services and the disruption of its implementation; and inaccurate assessment by the Russian special services as to the extent of their influence in these countries. A further factor constraining Russian capabilities – despite a continued policy interest in using these techniques in the Kremlin – is that mass expulsions of Russian special services personnel across Europe following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine disrupted the support apparatus through which Russia conducts many of its operations. Between Moscow’s continuing intent to employ these methods and the identified shortcomings of the tools available, the special services have gone about changing their structures and forms and methods for implementing these operations. It is critical that those tasked with countering Russian subversion adapt to continue to counter an evolving threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reforming-moscows-vanguard&quot;&gt;Reforming Moscow’s Vanguard&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stage in reforming Russia’s effectiveness following a string of failures was to improve both the honesty in reporting from the special services and the assessment of the likelihood of success. This was achieved in late 2022 by reforming the system for the management of operations. To do this, the Russian Presidential Administration established Committees of Special Influence under the overall direction of Sergei Kirienko, responsible for assigning the special services specific tasks against defined countries and to assess the effects of operations. By shifting the measure of special service operations from activities to effects, the committees began to cohere what had previously been rather disparate lines of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, over the course of 2023, following the failure of the second attempt to destabilise Moldova, Russian disinformation targeting the country became much more consistent and mutually reinforcing. Russia shifted to strengthen the public association between Moldova’s aspiration to join the EU and President Maia Sandu personally, while simultaneously blaming her for the country’s economic woes. At the same time, the Russians began targeting Romanian nationalists within Moldovan society to amplify their voices, and in doing so exacerbated the threat felt by Moldova’s Russian-speaking population in relation to increased alignment with Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of interlocking coherence in Russia’s active measures and information operations has been observed more broadly, especially the narratives aimed at undermining support for Ukraine. Although these information operations are not the subject of this report, the committee structure gives the Russian state a much better basis for judging the impact of violence on the social conditions within target countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel to the Committees of Special Influence, active measures such as violent provocations are authorised by a committee of the national security council, under the guidance of its secretary, Nikolai Patrushev. However, such operations can only realistically be considered if there are personnel and an infrastructure able to implement them. This re-forging of the GRU’s capacity for subversive operations is the primary focus of this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GRU has identified three general vulnerabilities that it needs to address in its ability to conduct unconventional operations. The first is the exposure of its personnel and their vulnerability to identification through modern analytical techniques, including the association of mobile phones with specified locations using advertising data and other means of collection. The second problem was the disruption to the GRU’s support apparatus in Europe and further afield owing to the expulsions of rezidentura and exposure of illegals. These two issues compound one another. According to the doctrine for the use of special purpose units, a key task is “legalisation”, the term used by the Russian special services to indicate building a legend or cover identity to enable covert activity to be carried out in a target country. Depending on the duration of the cover activity, the Russians divide legalisation into full and partial categories. Full legalisation provides for the possibility of the operator staying in place for an indefinite period and ensures their safety in the event of an in-depth inspection by the target’s security services. Partial legalisation is adequate for a short-term legend who can withstand basic levels of scrutiny. Although Unit 29155 was able to achieve partial legalisation for operations successfully, its activities had begun to expose enablers who had been through full legalisation and were slower and more difficult to emplace. The third problem is one of agent reliability. As the detection of GRU personnel has constrained their movement, so too has the management of agents become increasingly remote. The GRU has found, however, that the reliability of agents under remote control is unsatisfactory and in Moldova, as in Ukraine, has caused the failure of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The processes to address these problems started in 2020. Naturally, they take time to implement and have accelerated since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. First, Andrei Averyanov, formerly commander of the 161 Centre, was promoted to become deputy head of the GRU, responsible for cohering all unconventional operations other than those targeting Ukrainian territory. GRU operations targeting Ukrainian territory fall under the responsibility of Vladimir Alexeiev, as the GRU’s special representative to the Command of the Special Military Operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To carry on rebuilding its capacity for unconventional warfare, Averyanov established the Service for Special Activities. This now comprises three entities: Unit 29155, now given a Guards designation; the newly established Unit 54654; and a headquarters and planning department for coordinating the Service for Special Activities. The 161 Centre is now organised into one headquarters unit, three training units, an operational planning unit, three operational units, a financial unit also responsible for managing support infrastructure, and a supply unit. In total, the centre appears to employ 147 instructors who also serve as operatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security procedures at the 161 Centre have changed. Personnel no longer carry personal or service mobile phones to the site, relying instead on a controlled group of wired telephones. Although staff operate from the site, training exercises are no longer primarily conducted at the facility but are instead organised in a series of safe houses (“conspiratorial apartments” in GRU parlance). These measures appear to be aimed at reducing the signature and vulnerability to pattern-of-life analysis. The separation of training from a fixed location is also aimed at making it harder to identify new members of the operational units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the old members of Unit 29155 have now moved with Averyanov to the Service headquarters to plan and manage operational activities. New personnel are being recruited to conduct operations, with an altered pattern of recruiting and training focused on assuring a low signature. Whereas the old unit drew around half of its personnel from Spetsnaz formations, new recruits appear to disproportionately have no military experience and are instead given instruction on the full range of military skills necessary for their intended role from within the GRU. In intelligence tradecraft terms, this borrows from the longstanding practice of generating cleanskins (personnel with no prior association with official bodies). However, the expansion of the methodology from niche clandestine functions to general recruiting as a response to a more transparent operating environment is a substantial shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unit 54654 appears to function differently. If Unit 29155 is primarily intended to deploy personnel for active intelligence under partial legalisation, Unit 54654 is intended to have a higher proportion of personnel working under full legalisation to prepare operations. As well as recruiting personnel without prior military contracts, Unit 54654 also recruits contractors through front companies – the most widely used of which appears to be named Directorate – which are owned by the GRU but otherwise unaffiliated with the Russian government. In this way, their names and other information are not entered into government records and their pay is managed separately from records for military salaries. This appears to be a mechanism that has arisen from the growth of the GRU’s so-called “PMCs” (private military companies). However, unlike the Wagner Group, Redut and other structures, Unit 54654 is focused on human intelligence and the establishment of support structures premised on a network of illegals: officers operating without diplomatic cover. To further conceal their identities, personnel are often assigned jobs in non-defence-related ministries or private entities and, in some instances, work from these sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GRU are also reorganising the basis on which they endeavour to build support networks in target countries. During the period when many countries sought business in Russia, the use of dual Russian nationals and business people provided an effective means of legalisation for illegals. However, the growth of Western sanctions has placed greater scrutiny on these individuals so that they are an existing but diminished vector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, a major effort appears to be targeting foreign students studying at Russian universities. The 161 Centre has a budget allocated to pay the stipends of students from the Balkans, Africa and other regions where there remain exchanges with Russian educational institutions. These stipends subsidise study and living costs and are apparently used as a vehicle for recruitment. Since these individuals are often from the elites of the target countries concerned, they are in themselves valuable sources of intelligence. However, they are also useful enablers. Combined with the use of Central Asian legends for members of Unit 54654, it becomes possible, for example, for a Balkan journalist to introduce a Kazakh businessman to an Austrian colleague and in this way gain legalisation into European countries. The vector of student recruitment can also be used abroad. Sending Russian students to countries that are still relatively open for Russian nationals – including under the guise of the Russian dissident diaspora – creates the potential for members of Unit 54654 to recruit personnel who can act as a support apparatus for the inadvertent legalisation of Russian visitors through shared causes, such as anti-colonialism, Palestine, Green protest movements and other popular student movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, organised crime provides another vector for legalisation. Russian organised crime is heavily penetrated by the FSB. Consequently, the Russian special services can use Russian organised crime to create lucrative business opportunities and foster goodwill with international organised crime. In Ukraine, for example, Russia has significant access to the international drug cartel Khimprom and uses it for military purposes, including attempts to distribute synthetic drugs to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Outside Ukraine, the recruitment of organised crime members is an effective means of recruiting agents who can use the inflated proceeds from lucrative business dealings to establish support structures for Russian intelligence, including safe houses, cars and shell companies. The individuals can also be vehicles for recruiting criminals to perpetrate acts of violence. Criminal actors are also able to generate muscle without the need for participants to know that they are working under Russian control. This allows for deniability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important vector in the regeneration of a support apparatus is the Russian exile community. Some of those who fled Russian mobilisation in September 2022 oppose the war in Ukraine. However, many others are loyal to the Russian state, albeit not to the extent that they were willing to be mobilised, and the flow of people provided cover for special service personnel to enter third countries. Participation in Russian opposition media and other activities provides surface-level “ethical washing” and thereafter creates a pathway to legalisation, since these individuals can then claim asylum. At the same time, it becomes possible for them to collect on other elements of the diaspora. More importantly, these individuals can be financed to gain influence within the community and to acquire assets that become useful for supporting unconventional operations. The usual method is for these individuals to receive money for selling a property – fictitious or otherwise – in a third country and then to use the money from the sale to engage in business interactions with other Russian entities where the costs are inflated in order to move money to the individual. Once they have established properties or other assets, this becomes a self-sustaining financial structure to keep the agent in place while drawing only from legally acquired funds, reducing the risk of detection through financial irregularities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GRU’s reach in Europe suffered real setbacks from the widespread expulsion of Russian intelligence officers and the exposure of its personnel in the lead-up to the invasion of Ukraine. There has been some surprise at the limited use of sabotage and other means to disrupt Western supplies to Ukraine; less than after Russia’s original incursion into Donbas in 2014. This is partly because of a desire to manage escalation with NATO, but it is also the result of a lack of capacity. Russia is now actively trying to rebuild the capacity to embark on such operations. As the war in Ukraine protracts, Russia has an interest in creating crises further afield. The Balkans present a particularly serious set of opportunities for such enterprises. Russia also has an active interest in destabilising Ukraine’s partners, and with a slew of elections forthcoming across Europe there is a wide range of opportunities to exacerbate polarisation. Moreover, with its conventional forces – so often used to coerce others – fixed by the fighting in Ukraine, the significance of unconventional operations as a lever of influence increases. This is especially important with the collapse of Russian overt diplomatic access across target countries. In short, because of the measures described in this chapter to rebuild its vanguard, Russia poses a serious and sustained threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information operations are a critical enabler of Russia’s destabilisation and subversion efforts and are therefore rightly scrutinised. What is often ignored, however, is that the public – and the manipulation of public sentiment – is a vehicle to mobilise or paralyse constituencies who service factions of a country’s elite. The Russian theory of change is not premised on convincing a majority, but rather on empowering politicians in the target country who will spearhead the implementation of policy favourable to Russia. The objective is elite capture. The use of violent provocation to exacerbate political crisis is a consistent part of the process. As the Drozdov Binomial indicates, the lynchpin of this process is the human intelligence support apparatus, which handles agents in the elite, facilitates active measures and ultimately sets the conditions for violence. Countering disinformation, although still necessary, is far less consequential than degrading the support apparatus in disrupting this process. European states must remain vigilant in their counterintelligence activities even as the GRU seeks to adapt. The process of elite capture may be contested in Europe, but has proven much easier in Africa, where the GRU has made significant gains since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This line of effort is the subject of the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-roscolonialism-wagner-and-the-grus-expeditionary-corps&quot;&gt;II. “Roscolonialism”: Wagner and the GRU’s Expeditionary Corps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the St Petersburg Economic Forum in June 2022, President Vladimir Putin declared that the West was “still influenced by their own misconceptions about countries outside the so-called ‘golden billion’: they consider everything a backwater, or their backyard. They still treat them like colonies, and the people living there, like second-class people, because they consider themselves exceptional”. For Putin, this reflected what he believes the West did to Russia in the 1990s and his own quest to rebuild Russian greatness. But it was also a pitch to other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when many Western states were trying to economically isolate Russia following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin saw the development of economic ties with Africa and the Middle East as a means to sanction-proof Russia, and he had a pitch for the leaders of these states. It centred on the proposition that the “international rules-based order” advocated for by the West structurally favoured Western interests, whereas Russia’s emphasis on sovereignty would offer a mutually beneficial partnership. The reality – as Russian officials acknowledged internally – was a renewed Russian colonialism. Nevertheless, the Kremlin, through the GRU, has now set about seeking to build an “Entente Roscolonial” – a group of states that actively seek to assist Russia, while also becoming increasingly subordinate to Russian influence – displacing Western interests across Africa and the Middle East. This strategy’s trajectory is now becoming clear, but to appreciate its mechanisms one must understand the groundwork that was laid since 2014. Russia’s early forays into Africa were ad hoc. The foundations laid by that engagement have now developed into a deliberate strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter briefly summarises the work of the Wagner Group before outlining how Russian policy has developed since Yevgeny Prigozhin’s mutiny in June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-wagner-groups-ring-cycle&quot;&gt;The Wagner Group’s Ring Cycle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of the development of Russia’s new colonialism is intimately bound up with the evolution of the so-called “Wagner Group”, one of the most widely misrepresented elements of Russia’s unconventional warfare capabilities. Much writing about the Wagner Group describes it as a PMC, used by the Russian state while at the same time pursuing an independent agenda. This fundamentally overlooks the dependency the group had on the Kremlin in all its activities and the extent to which its business activities followed Russian interests, rather than pre-empted them. The Wagner Group was financed by the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation both directly and through the provision of profitable government contracts to Prigozhin, mostly related to the provision of food to servicemen and maintenance of military units’ housing stock. From May 2022 to May 2023 alone, Russia spent around $1 billion on wages and compensation payments to Wagner’s fighters. By way of comparison, the Russian national health system was allocated around $1.3 billion in 2022. This level of funding was not a unique consequence of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Between 2014 and 2023, Prigozhin received contracts worth over $10 billion from the government of the Russian Federation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These funds do not include the provision of weapons and military equipment to the Wagner Group nor the costs of enablement by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. These were transferred via military units subordinated to the GRU. For example, the documents of Russian mercenaries who fought on the side of General Khalifa Haftar against the UN-recognised Government of National Unity in Libya, which were captured by Libyan intelligence during the fighting for Tripoli, contain an application to receive weapons and military equipment required for a mission. The mercenaries received four tanks, six BMPs, 12 trucks and 44 other vehicles. This equipment is comparable to that required by one mechanised company and supporting motorised companies of the Russian armed forces. In Ukraine, the Wagner Group received hundreds of heavy weapons from the Ministry of Defence, which included, in addition to armoured vehicles and artillery, anti-aircraft and electronic warfare systems, as well as huge amounts of ammunition. Throughout the group’s existence, the infrastructure of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation – particularly the Molkino training centre in Krasnodar – was used to train Wagner Group fighters. The Wagner Group’s headquarters, camp and combat training centre were located at the military base of the 10th Special Forces Brigade. The transport of Wagner Group fighters and goods to Syria, Sudan, Libya and the Central African Republic (CAR) was carried out by the 223rd Aviation Unit of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that most of the finance and enablement for Wagner Group activities comes directly from the Russian state shows that their operations were only viable if they received Russian state approval and that there was willingness to devote considerable resources to them. The Wagner Group, therefore, evolved in response to the GRU’s various requirements. The original unit of recruited fighters, formed around GRU officer Dmitri Utkin – call sign “Wagner” – in Ukraine after the Revolution of Dignity in 2014 to fight in Donbas, was a tool of the GRU’s unconventional war against Kyiv. Subsequently, when Russia decided to intervene in Syria, these groupings of fighters provided a convenient means of putting Russian fighters in harm’s way while reducing any political controversy by limiting the number of Russian soldiers killed. The decision to deploy Wagner to support Haftar in Libya followed Russian wishes to constrain Western access to Libyan oil and gas. Over time, however, all these operations created an ecosystem of troops who worked together on multiple operations and began to form a corporate identity. Moreover, Prigozhin’s administrative efficiency and his closeness to Putin at the time made him a trusted administrator for these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that so many different lines of effort became grouped under one person lent itself to a growing coherence between what had originally been diverse and separate lines of effort. The “Wagner Group” never existed as an official entity. Fighters were employed by various companies. But Wagner became the personnel’s corporate identity anyway. Because many of the Wagner Group’s administrative personnel were from the GRU, they pursued the traditional Russian special service methodology of endeavouring to make operations (operating as compared with capital costs) self-financing. This led to the pursuit of mining concessions and other cash-generating activities once deployed. Again, because the operations were connected through Prigozhin, this began to create a corporate identity for the organisation, although it was not in itself incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian thinking about the opportunities that the emergence of the Wagner Group created began to mature from 2016 to 2018. This coincided with a concerted effort to expand Russian influence and build new partnerships internationally. Within the SVR there was a sudden expansion of activities coordinated through the Coordinating Committee on Economic Cooperation with African Countries South of the Sahara (Afrokom). Although Afrokom had been established in 2009, from 2016 onwards the intensity of its activities increased. One important line of effort was the mapping of Russian influence on the continent. This was carried out through Russian cultural institutions like Rossotrudnichestvo, which began to reach out to African alumni of Russian and Soviet universities, usually under the auspices of printing yearbooks. Receptions for officials who had graduated from these universities began to be held in Russian embassies. The aim was to reconnect with those who might be both locally influential and positively disposed to Russia to begin conversations about expanding cooperation. The SVR also began to organise investment packages through Russian banks to expand the goodwill of key partners. Trips to Moscow for second-tier African politicians started to be expanded. Another line of effort saw the Russian defence ministry seek to expand defence exports across the continent, with a significant increase in the number of Rosoboronexport representatives posted to African countries. Between 2014 and 2018, Russia signed 19 defence cooperation agreements with African states. The overall volume of arms sales remains small and concentrated in Egypt and Algeria, but the influence and reach generated had wider implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GRU also began to expand intelligence collection across Africa. In 2018, Prigozhin established the Back Office Africa, essentially an intelligence and planning cell for Wagner operations in Africa. The cell was small, comprising 28 personnel, and had a modest budget. Several of its members, including Younis Nazarovich Abazid, were GRU officers. The GRU had deployed Abazid to Syria in 2016 to collect intelligence on the Islamic State and Jabhat Al-Nusra, and he had been a part of Russian negotiations trying to cohere the pro-Assad coalition. However, lines of effort were divided by country within the Back Office Africa. A heavy emphasis was placed on economic analysis and political technologists, political scientists and sociologists who were commissioned to produce studies of target countries. The Back Office’s first operations targeting Mozambique in 2019 did not go well. Nevertheless, the organisation learned from setbacks. Mali would arguably prove a turning point in its effective displacement of Western rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Malian government signed a peace agreement with Tuareg and Arab rebels in 2015, with UN peacekeepers deployed to prevent clashes between both sides. However, insurgency broke out around Mopti from Fulani herders during that year, and over time Al-Qaeda and other extremist groups managed to co-opt the Fulani insurgency across the tri-border area. Led by France, Western states pursued a strategy of trying to provide human security in isolated communities while conducting counterterrorism raids with the G5 group of Sahelian states. There were many problems with this approach. The counterterrorism operation was fundamentally about protecting Europe through the targeted killing of jihadists. At the same time, the peacekeeping mission shielded rebel groups from being confronted by the state, but the lack of political progress and consequent economic stagnation drove people to banditry. While communities might be safe from physical attack in towns guarded by the UN, they also had no prospects, and the Malian military felt unable to implement a policy that would change the dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian encouragement of the Malian military to reclaim the state’s sovereignty from its Western partners proved persuasive. The first coup, on 18 August 2020, was orchestrated by a group of colonels, two of whom had just returned from receiving training in Russia and were instrumental in seizing Mali’s main military base. After the military failed to push through the changes they wanted with an interim transitional government, they launched a second coup on 24 May 2021, and set about laying the groundwork for Russian mercenaries to enter Mali. The Russians promised to provide soldiers and equipment to the Malian armed forces to aggressively attack rebel communities. The Malian state could therefore expel MINUSMA (the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali) and the French without losing access to the military support necessary to implement a sovereign policy. Russian forces began to arrive in December 2021 and have since succeeded in getting Mali’s international partners for over a decade expelled. Russia is now replicating its offer in Burkina Faso and Niger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Africa strategy – to displace Western interests, gain control over critical resources, and reduce its own vulnerability to sanctions – was disrupted by the failure to achieve a rapid victory in Ukraine. Suddenly, Wagner was repurposed to confront Russia’s latest security challenge, providing troops to bolster Russian ground forces in Donbas. Nevertheless, as Putin made clear in his 2022 speech at the St Petersburg Economic Forum, the Africa strategy remained a key priority for the Kremlin. When Prigozhin launched an attempt to have Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov removed from office in June 2023 over their incompetent prosecution of the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin faced a serious problem. On the one hand, there was a clear need to remove those who had conducted the mutiny. At the same time, for reasons of convenience as much as anything else, a significant part of Russia’s foreign policy had become structurally implemented through the Wagner Group. How, therefore, could Russia continue expanding its African partnerships while breaking up the single power centre that had caused such disruption to operations in Ukraine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;averyanovs-expeditionary-corps-and-the-regime-survival-package&quot;&gt;Averyanov’s Expeditionary Corps and the Regime Survival Package&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prigozhin might have been on a trajectory to establish himself as an independent actor, but at the point he attempted to exert this – either through extending his authority too early, too far or both – that independence proved illusory. His move against Gerasimov and Shoigu did not receive the retrospective official support he seems to have hoped for, and precipitated his downfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the crisis meetings following Prigozhin’s mutiny, the Russian Presidential Administration made several structural decisions. In late June 2023, it was decided that the Prigozhin enterprise would be broken up before the liquidation of the Wagner Group’s leadership. The FSB would take over Prigozhin’s domestic commercial enterprises and his communications businesses would come under SVR supervision. The foreign military components would fall under the GRU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the GRU, it was decided that Wagner’s activities would be divided into two components. First, a Volunteer Corps would be formed covering operations in Ukraine. Companies such as Redut would provide the legal mechanism for Wagner fighters to sign up as individuals. These companies would then sign a contract to provide services to the Russian Ministry of Defence, thus bringing them under the Russian military’s control. The Volunteer Corps would be managed within the GRU by Alexeiev as the GRU’s special representative to the Command of the Special Military Operation. In parallel, the GRU has established an Expeditionary Corps, which also uses a range of companies, including Convoy, as fronts for fighters to sign up. The GRU Expeditionary Corps is commanded by Andrei Averyanov and directed by his Service for Special Activities. The initial aspiration was for 40,000 troops to join the Expeditionary Corps. This was subsequently reduced to a target of 20,000 by the end of 2023 – which the GRU failed to meet – with the aspiration to recruit and train local forces to make up additional mass. Although slower than originally hoped, the number of personnel is steadily rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This division may have sounded straightforward on paper but would prove highly complicated to implement. First, Wagner fighters exercised some agency in where they signed up. Pavel Prigozhin, Yevgeny’s son, attempted to retain some control over the organisation by offering Wagner as a formed body to Victor Zolotov and the Rosgvardia (National Guard). This was consistent with instructions to Rosgvardia to expand its combat capabilities in Ukraine and so was partially approved. The result was a bidding war for commanders between the GRU and Rosgvardia. A similar problem arose between the Volunteer and Expeditionary Corps. The latter was clearly safer and offered long-term opportunities for lucrative financial rackets. The former was much more dangerous. The GRU attempted to manage this tension by adjusting the financial packages between the outfits. Nevertheless, the resulting division of Wagner units has proven disruptive to force cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further challenge that had to be managed was the offer and coherence of deployed Expeditionary Corps units. Under Wagner, the Back Office Africa negotiated the provision of support with parallel concessions or other compensation often granted to a parallel company. For example, in 2018, after the president of the CAR, Faustin-Archange Touadera, appealed to Russia to provide him with assistance in the fight against insurgent groups and to provide his close protection, his former national security advisor Valery Zakharov (a former Russian intelligence officer) returned to his office. Despite his title, Zakharov was responsible for a wide range of issues, including the coordination of economic projects of interest to the Russian Federation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar situation is observed in Sudan, where the Wagner Group has been active since 2017. Russian mercenaries appeared in Sudan after President Omar Bashir’s visit to Moscow, where he signed several agreements with the Russian government, including the establishment of a Russian naval base in Port Sudan and a gold-mining concession between the Russian firm M-Invest (at that time close to Prigozhin) and the Sudanese Ministry of Minerals. It is worth noting that Russia is now pursuing its interests in Sudan – including setting its sights on the oil refinery in Khartoum – through the Rapid Support Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial reason for this cost recovery was precisely to create implausible deniability for the Kremlin. This was because many of the operations being conducted were either at the expense of other states or violated UN Security Council resolutions. For example, the use of the Wagner Group in the CAR circumvented the direct prohibition of the UN Security Council on the supply of arms and military equipment to the CAR. There is no doubt that the CAR government perceived the presence of Russian mercenaries and other military and non-military assistance provided by Prigozhin’s staff as coming directly from the government of the Russian Federation. Thus, in 2020, an official CAR government representative publicly announced that Russia would send several hundred military personnel and heavy military equipment to the CAR. According to him, this was done to support the government on the eve of the presidential and parliamentary elections within the framework of official agreements concluded between the CAR and the Russian Federation. A communiqué issued by the CAR Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed his words. Official representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, represented by the Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the CAR and Deputy Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, immediately denied this, saying that Russia conscientiously complies with all the requirements set out in UN resolutions. In January 2023, however, the Kremlin directed cost recovery as a means of avoiding the diversion of resources from the Special Military Operation, and also to link target countries with Russia economically, thereby expanding avenues for sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem for the Expeditionary Corps is that it risks the removal of this plausible deniability. Since the contracts signed by fighters are with private companies, it is possible for Moscow to retain implausible deniability as to the personnel. It is harder, however, for this to be the case with the negotiation of business deals and agreements. It appears that Russia has finally decided to explicitly challenge the international system rather than pretend to comply with it. Shortly after Prigozhin’s death, Averyanov began to tour African capitals alongside Russian Deputy Defence Minister Yunus-bek Yevkurov, accompanied by former Wagner commanders. The message they delivered to key partners was consistent: former commitments would be honoured, but they would now deal directly with the Russian Ministry of Defence. This has not stopped the parallel financing of operations. The Malian government, for example, is currently reforming its mining code to allow foreign concessions to be seized and then allocated to Russian companies. Russia’s proposal is that it will use the money that would otherwise have gone to Australian and other companies to pay for its military support to the Malian government, and that the Malian government will continue to gain taxation from the mines and will not be lumbered with the debt finance proffered by the West. Russia has a particular interest in lithium mines and has established a gold refinery within its compound at Bamako International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of August 2023, the Russian government assessed the strengths and vulnerabilities of the Africa strategy. Documents reveal a vision of exploiting access for a more concerted attack on Western interests. For example, it is proposed that Russia’s relations with Niger could be used to threaten French access to uranium mined in the country, further increasing the French energy sector’s dependence on Russian-supplied uranium. But the assessments also make clear that Russia has vulnerabilities. The understanding and business acumen of the GRU represents a particular area of concern, since Prigozhin’s financial structures in Africa were complex. The SVR is likely to play a leading role in trying to cohere this line of effort. Another significant risk that Russian analysts highlighted was of Russia’s explicit involvement causing a growing perception of economic exploitation and colonialism, undermining Moscow’s anti-colonial message. The analysts acknowledge the fundamentally colonial nature of the Russian project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “offer” the GRU is now pushing is being internally described as the “regime survival package”. The logic of this offer is that Russia will provide elites in target countries with military support, economic and political protection from backlash via the UN or other international mechanisms, and the support of political technologists to sell their popularity domestically. A critical component of the package is the isolation of a target country’s leadership. For example, in Mali, the Expeditionary Corps – as occurred in the CAR – now provides presidential protection, since this proximity ensures sustained understanding and influence within Malian decision-making. Wagner has a long history of establishing domestic propaganda structures. One of the first successful examples was the creation of the Lengo Songo radio station, which quickly became one of the mouthpieces of Russian propaganda in the CAR and is consistently among the three most popular radio stations in the country. It is worth noting that the Russian political technologist and media manager Igor Mangushev (formerly a Russian navy officer who organised Russian paramilitary groups in the war against Ukraine in Crimea and Donbas in 2014) was heavily involved in establishing the programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the effect of this offer is to close off the relationships that a country has with the West. Very often, the conduct of massacres and other violations of international law will prevent Western partners from maintaining links with a partner military, the long-term effects of which may not be fully appreciated when cooperation is first agreed. Furthermore, in the medium term, the violent approach used by the Expeditionary Corps may secure a government and fulfil perceived short-term needs, but is unlikely to bring peace to the hinterlands of the recipient country. It is worth noting that the Russian approach is consistent with the tenets of Soviet anti-partisan warfare, involving the use of collective punishment, hostage-taking of local political figures and aggressive raids to kill insurgents. The effect is often the defeat of an insurgent group but an absence of stability or human security. The result is that Russian security partners initially gain a sovereign capability through Russia’s mercenaries and medium-term personal security. However, they also become dependent and begin to lose access to alternative security providers. In the medium to long term, the economic concessions Russia demands risk creating an extremely unequal relationship, in which Moscow extracts much more than it offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One solution arrived at by Russia to reduce the reputational harm associated with a colonial project is to conduct partnered operations. In August 2023, Avreyanov and Yevkurov visited Syria, where they met President Bashar Al-Assad, and Libya, where they met Haftar. According to the readouts from the meetings, both leaders expressed approval for the suppression of the Wagner Group and were encouraged that the Russian state would continue to provide support. It was also proposed – and apparently favourably received – to establish fighter training camps that would be run by the Expeditionary Corps in Palmyra and Tobruk. In both cases, the offer was to train fighters for the respective Syrian and Libyan forces. However, it is also evident that the Expeditionary Corps will look to recruit some of the trained personnel to work with them in Africa. This has precedent. Wagner, for example, brought Syrian fighters with them to Libya. They are currently preparing to move troops to Burkina Faso, and the contingent may include both Russian and non-Russian troops. Another way the Russians wish to show partnership is by embedding advisors in partner forces rather than simply providing contingents to work alongside partners. These measures are not new. They are highly consistent with the Russian experience in Chechnya, and the resemblance to Russia’s Chechnya policy in the construction of the Entente Roscolonial does not stop at combat unit structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Entente Roscolonial is a serious threat to Western interests. First, with the US increasingly fixated on the Indo-Pacific and European attention saturated by the war in Ukraine, most African operations have become economy-of-force affairs. Moreover, the disparity in resourcing and attention paid to Ukraine or Gaza as compared to Tigray, for instance, has left a strong and bitter sense across Africa as to the hierarchy of Western concerns. Similarly, the apparent contrast in Western language and rhetoric between how it described the destruction of Aleppo or Mariupol, and how it has excused Israeli operations in Gaza, leave many on the continent perceiving a gap between Western rhetoric about values and the values practised by those who have, for so long, imposed constraints on the policies of African states to enforce values-based norms. The language used when rejecting Western security assistance in favour of Russia is almost always that of sovereignty. This is not to suggest that there are not defensible reasons for Western policy, but the perception is clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, Russia is exploiting a rich opportunity to build new relationships and, in doing so, set up challenges for the West. Through persistent instability, Russia can push migration into Europe, creating the conditions for Averyanov’s Service for Special Activities to pursue political destabilisation, as is being explored through illegal migration pushed towards Finland. Leverage over natural resources is also expanding. Perhaps most problematic, however, is how the pitch for values is giving Russia access to communities that interface with a range of extremist beliefs. In this, as with the training approach being explored in Syria and Libya, Russia is expanding what its proxy Ramzan Kadyrov offers, which is the subject of the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-kadyrovtsy-and-the-defence-of-traditional-values&quot;&gt;III. The Kadyrovtsy and the Defence of “Traditional” Values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Expeditionary Corps is intended to be the vanguard of Putin’s multipolar world view, offering those who reject Western legal structures the means to preserve their rule and wreak violence on their enemies. If the Expeditionary Corps is an offer to elites, there are more populist narratives that Russia pushes at a range of constituencies. Russia’s argument is that it is the bastion of “traditional values”, embodied by religiosity, the nuclear family, heterosexuality and loyalty to the state. The Orthodox Church pushes this outreach to religious groups in the US, and through social media to conservative constituencies across Western Europe and North America. This vision of Russia is contrasted with a depiction of the West as, according to some of the increasingly lurid propaganda narratives being promoted, a bastion of decadent homosexual worship of Satan. The Russian narrative of its defence of traditional values finds a particular expression and confluence with Russia’s unconventional warfare capabilities in Chechnya under Kadyrov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kadyrov’s distinctive monologues on social media, the tactically spurious combat theatre pushed by Chechen fighters on TikTok and the arbitrary violence of Chechen politics mean that modern-day Chechnya appears comic as much as it does tragic to Western audiences. Nevertheless, many of the perceptions of Chechnya and its leader are inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kadyrov is largely autonomous in his domestic politics. The Russian state does not seek to impose control, and indeed the Kadyrov clan owe their position to an inability on the part of the Kremlin to do so unilaterally at acceptable cost in the past. Putin and Kadyrov share a mutual dependency. Kadryov is loyal to Putin and thereby keeps Chechnya closely aligned to Russia’s foreign policy. There is a personal loyalty here that means Kadyrov will seek the permission of and take direction from Moscow where it matters to the Kremlin. Furthermore, like Wagner, 85% of Chechnya’s budget comes from the Russian state. Like Prigozhin, Kadyrov is fundamentally dependent on Moscow. Like Wagner, Chechnya’s semi-autonomous character lends itself to deniability for the Kremlin. Where Kadyrov exerts himself in building influence expands Russia’s reach and closely aligns with the interests of Russia’s special services. After all, Kadyrov can reach audiences that Moscow does not across the Muslim world and Chechen diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian official propaganda and networks of hidden influence operating in Muslim countries push a romantic image of Kadyrov as a defender of Islam, opposing Western heretics who are trying to destroy traditional values. A good recent example of this dynamic was how Kadyrov’s son was filmed beating a prisoner accused of burning a Qur’an. This was contrasted with the restraint of Swedish and Danish police in punishing Qur’an burnings that took place in 2023. Qur’an burnings in Sweden not only led to violent clashes with the police, and caused rifts with Ankara at a time when Stockholm was seeking to join NATO, but prompted Iraqi protesters to storm and set light to the Swedish embassy in Baghdad. Chechen and Russian influence channels exacerbated these dynamics by highlighting the contrast in Arabic media, and amplified criticism of Sweden and Denmark. Another good example is how Kadyrov was extremely forceful in denouncing Israel during its war against Hamas in late 2023. Kadyrov’s anti-Israeli statements were actively replicated by Russian- and Chechen-controlled media, as well as by troll factories on social networks targeting Muslim audiences, mainly in Arabic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build-up of influence is also pursued through charity and social work, primarily conducted through the Akhmat Kadyrov Foundation. This organisation funded the reconstruction of mosques in Aleppo, but also promotes Kadyrov’s status by popularising the image of his father Akhmat Kadyrov as a religious figure. This work is also pursued through entities such as the European Islamic Forum. The organisation is especially active in the Balkans, where it has established ties with authoritative Muslim representatives (not only religious, but also political figures) in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Croatia, Greece and Romania. The European Islamic Forum is also active on EU territory. For example, the forum held a conference dedicated to the 70th anniversary of Akhmat Kadyrov in Estonia in 2021, which was attended by Muslim representatives from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Denmark, Finland, Poland, Sweden, Germany and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popularity that Kadyrov has created personally on religious and nationalistic grounds among the Chechen diaspora allows his representatives to reach into and recruit personnel on different sides of a range of conflicts and across a wide geography. In Libya, for example, while the Russian state backs Haftar, Kadyrov maintains diplomatic channels with the internationally recognised Libyan government. In 2016, Kadyrov stated that at the very beginning of the war in Syria, fighters of the Chechen special forces were sent to training camps to join militants who professed Wahhabism. Whether this would have been to penetrate the Islamic State and other groups to counter any potential threat that they posed or to support, influence and partially co-opt them is not entirely clear. Nevertheless, Chechens achieved senior positions in many of Syria’s militias including the Islamic State, and the group did manage a range of negotiations with the Assad government, for which such networks would be exceedingly useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kadyrov’s claim is plausible. Such actions are consistent with historical operations of the Russian special services. There are also proven instances of the Kadyrovtsy using these methods during the war in Ukraine. Husein Jambetov, who fought on the side of Ukraine in 2022 as a platoon commander, appeared in Chechnya in 2023 where he spoke to mercenaries at the Russian Special Forces University with a call to be loyal to Russia and Kadyrov. It is also clear that Kadyrov has no problem encouraging and engaging with Islamist extremists. Abdullah Anzorov, who in 2020 killed French teacher Samuel Pati for showing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in a free speech class, was subsequently praised by Kadyrov, who declared that the teacher was guilty of his own murder. Russian troll farms amplified this pronouncement among Arab audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anzorov is interesting because he sits at the intersection of Kadyrov’s religious and ethnic influence. He was a member of a Chechen mixed martial arts (MMA) club in Paris. Martial arts have been used extensively as vectors of Kadyrov’s influence since 2007, when there was a concerted effort to infiltrate Chechen diaspora organisations. This followed two well-established approaches of the Soviet special services: the seeding of agents into refugee groups; and the use of martial arts as a structured social setting enabling both network recruitment and coordination. The Soviet preference was the use of combat sambo, although the sport is rarely found outside the former Soviet Union. Kadyrov prefers MMA, which as a catch-all for different training disciplines enjoys broad reach. Kadyrov’s representative in Germany is European MMA champion Timur Dugazaev, who went there as a political refugee and now organises Chechens for pro-Russian street protests. The representative in France is Ali Bajayev, a refugee and former lieutenant colonel in the Russian armed forces. Sentiments among the Chechens of France and indeed other European regions are growing increasingly pro-Russian. During riots organised by Chechens in Dijon in 2020, the use of Russian symbols and the painting of pro-Russian graffiti, including the words “Glory to Putin!”, were recorded. Kadyrov then expressed his personal support for the rioters. It is notable that Chechens came from all over Europe to participate in the riots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular MMA fighters are also used to influence both their international fans and other countries’ elites. MMA champion Khamzat Chimaev, who is close to Kadyrov, lived in Sweden from childhood and represented that country, but moved to Dubai in October 2023 and will henceforth represent the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of social status and access to a range of constituencies – both secular and religious – makes Kadyrov a valuable proxy diplomat of the Russian Federation; a unique capability for a regional governor in Russia that occasionally generates comment. In recent years, he has managed to establish effective working relationships with many leaders in the Middle East, including the president of the UAE, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, representatives of the royal family of Bahrain, and leaders of Jordan. It is indicative, for example, that during his visit to Russia in 2017, the king of Saudi Arabia spent more time with Kadyrov than with Putin. The refusal of several states to join the anti-Russian sanctions associated with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine is partly shaped by Kadyrov’s diplomatic efforts. It is not surprising that in July 2023, Putin appointed Kadyrov’s adviser Turko Daudov as a permanent representative to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Daudov was previously a key representative of Chechnya in Arab and Muslim countries. It is arguable that Russia places more importance on Kadyrov as a diplomat than his interlocutors, who are pursuing relationships with Russia for a range of reasons. Nevertheless, personal relationships matter in diplomacy, and Kadyrov has become the intermediary for a range of Russian efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Kadyrov conducts defence diplomacy through the Russian Special Forces University, a private organisation that was created at Kadyrov’s initiative in 2013. It was initially called the International Training Center for Special Purpose Forces, and the direct supervisor of the project was Kadyrov’s adviser, Colonel Daniil Martynov, a former employee of the Special Purpose Centre of the FSB. The organisation has been widely misunderstood. Many have mistakenly believed that it is for training special forces. Like the 161 Training Centre, Chechnya does maintain special operations forces and uses them to conduct assassinations and sabotage. It also performs political demonstrations. In 2016, during Russian Special Forces University training in the Arctic, a group of Chechen special forces brought weapons and military equipment to the territory of Longyear Airport, located on the Norwegian demilitarised Svalbard archipelago, which became the cause of a diplomatic scandal between the two countries. Although the university uses the mystique of special operations in its marketing, the organisation is better understood to be a centre where special forces train irregular troops. It provides this training internationally and for preparing forces for the front in Ukraine. It is, perhaps, a good model for understanding what the GRU may end up establishing in Palmyra and Tobruk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chechen model is useful in understanding the forms, methods and threat posed by Russia’s unconventional warfare capabilities because it shows how multiple lines of effort, cohered under one individual, become mutually reinforcing over time. They are then brought together to achieve the interest of the Russian state. During the failed coup attempt in Montenegro, for example, the operation was coordinated by GRU officer Victor Boyarkin, close to the oligarch Oleg Deripaska, with representatives of Unit 29155. Boyarkin, however, was supported by both Serbian organised criminal elements under Sasha Sajelich, and by Martynov, which – according to the documents relating to the trial – worked with Kadyrov’s networks to try to sway the attitude of the Muslim population to support the coup’s outcome. During Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the intersection between active measures targeting popular sentiment and provocations using proxy networks and sabotage groups remains a serious threat. Kadyrov’s importance to the Kremlin’s unconventional warfare planners is perhaps best demonstrated by the fact that it was Chechen organised criminals who were used to liaise with Ukrainian criminal networks just prior to the full- scale invasion, in an attempt to co-opt them to support the occupation administration. It was also Kadyrov’s special forces, led by Martynov, who were to lead the seizure of the governmental buildings in Kyiv and thereafter the kill or capture of leading Ukrainians. As Russia attempts more unconventional operations in Africa, Kadyrov’s involvement should be anticipated. Understanding how semi-autonomous actors like Kadyrov fit into the kaleidoscopic tools that Russia applies is important if Russia’s targets are to ensure their resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resilience of the approach in the long term is also worth noting. The extent of Kadyrov’s popularity and influence among the Chechen people, both within Chechnya and among the diaspora, is concerning and a potential harbinger of how Russian influence might play out elsewhere. The Kadyrov clan facilitated the occupation of Chechnya by Russia, who were unable to control the region despite exceptionally heavy-handed measures. The results were disastrous for the population; while estimates vary and accurate figures are likely impossible to ascertain, up to 300,000 Chechen civilians may have died during the Chechen wars and insurgency, out of a population of little more than a million. For many years, this betrayal earned the clan a lasting hostility, and to a degree Kadyrov still rules by force, having progressively purged opponents, rivals and even on occasion his own supporters. However, a younger generation has come of age only experiencing Kadyrovite rule. While Ramzan’s rule might previously have been precarious, it appears that generational change and the ability to provide patronage to younger people with few other prospects outside the Chechen state apparatus, other than moving away, has lent his regime a significant degree of stability, even resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While GRU operations abroad are adjacent to those of Kadyrov, the methodologies overlap. Arguments that the scale of obstacles faced by the Wagner Group in the past indicate that Russian expeditionary operations will harm Western interests but ultimately provide little strategic benefit for Russia have some justification – Mozambique provides an example of repeated setbacks and limited progress. However, if they are allowed to solidify their influence or control unchallenged over many years and are able to conduct a high volume of influence operations and propaganda, their presence may be increasingly accepted, even as the downsides become apparent to regional actors entangled in isolation and dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that in the aftermath of Prigozhin’s mutiny, the Russian state sought to bring much of its proxy force more directly under Moscow’s control. Kadyrov, however, remains an outlier. Not only did he swiftly pledge loyalty to Putin, but Putin appears to retain confidence that despite Kadyrov’s significant power base he will not create comparable disruption for the Kremlin in the future. It may be that at a personal level, Putin’s trust is well placed. Beyond Kadyrov, however, Chechnya has a range of disputes with its neighbours inside Russia, especially with Ingushetia and Dagestan. How these disputes will manifest in a post-Kadyrov world is an interesting question. It is certainly evident that the Kremlin’s comfort with Kadyrov’s autonomy is not shared among Russia’s Slav population. The irony is that the very diffusion of effort and entrepreneurialism that makes Russia’s unconventional warfare capabilities dangerous remains a long-term threat to Russian stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has highlighted the growing and diversifying threat from Russian unconventional warfare targeting states beyond Ukraine. These activities contribute to the wider use of information operations and active measures to destabilise and subvert opposing states. The Russian playbook has been remarkably consistent for decades. The overall approach is to use information operations and active measures to polarise a target population, mobilise factions in support of allied elites, and paralyse support for opposing elements of a country’s leadership. Human intelligence operations are used to attempt elite capture through the offer of assistance to politicians who support Russian interests. Finally, violence can be employed to escalate political tensions to the point of crisis, or in other contexts to isolate a captured elite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report, primarily concerned with the latter part of this cycle, has demonstrated three things. First, although the Russian capacity for covert violence in Europe was disrupted by the exposure of its personnel and the breaking up of elements of its support apparatus, the Russian state is actively working to rebuild this capacity. Second, the intent to achieve this reflects a wider intent to widen the aperture of its geostrategic competition with the West, which could manifest in Europe, but is already being carried out at scale in Africa. Third, as the example of Kadyrov shows, the kaleidoscopic and chaotic lines of effort pursued by Russia’s special services – if left unchecked – will become increasingly mutually supporting and harder to disrupt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian approaches are often crude and this report has detailed a litany of failures. Tradecraft and operational security are often poor, although the current process of restructuring and reform may bolster the capability for operations to remain undetected. There is a systemic problem in the Russian special services with a lack of independent analysis. Those tasked with implementing an operation are primarily responsible for assessing its likely success and are therefore prone to overestimate their capabilities. Nevertheless, the Russians persist and, if left unchecked, failures as experienced in Mozambique turn into successes as seen in Mali. Europe faces a slew of elections this year, and the initial chaotic application of active measures is steadily becoming more coherent under the close attention of Russia’s Presidential Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of this threat, Western states must appreciate that undermining the human intelligence activity that supports unconventional warfare methods is vital to degrading Russia’s capacity to employ the techniques described in this report. In this context, countering disinformation – while important – is far less consequential than breaking Russia’s access to and leverage over elites, and its support apparatus for active measures. This can be achieved through the exposure and arrest of its agents, intelligence officers and activities. Stepping up counterintelligence activity in this regard is an important priority. The risk is that the effort to constrain Russia becomes a McCarthyite paranoia. As a lot of Russia’s unconventional operations are self-defeating, countering Russian unconventional warfare must be premised on careful, selective and intelligence-driven targeting. This is why having a broad understanding of Russian forms and methods is essential; it protects a state from jumping at shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Russia’s progress in Africa is referred to in this report as the formation of an “Entente Roscolonial”. On the one hand, it is – as Russian officials admit internally – a colonial project to gain control over African governments and exploit the continent’s natural resources. On the other hand, an entente – or informal and friendly alliance between factions – reflects the fact that Russia has been invited to take up this mantle and the juntas that are inviting the Russians in often have significant popular support, at least among the majority ethnic groups in their countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s mandate is due to the West’s strategic neglect and its failure to address the problems that its partners face. Russia may also fail to do this, but for now frustration with the West in both Africa and the Middle East is high. The point is that while Western states focus on rebuilding their conventional deterrence in Europe, strategic documents emphasising the nature of a global competition are being vindicated. Yet Western states are failing to compete. This must change. Russia is using unconventional warfare to advance its vision of a multipolar world order. This poses threats far beyond Ukraine. It is critical that Western states rise to meet that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第七天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示陳沛敏與楊清奇之間的 WhatsApp 對話，可見陳於2020年5月8日傳送3個 Patreon 連結給楊，分別為蕭若元、劉細良和雲海。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何會傳送上述3人的 Patreon 連結，陳稱記得黎曾點名提及喜歡劉細良的文章，想邀請劉撰寫文章，所以可能會透過張劍虹問她有否劉的聯絡方法，然後她會傳送給楊清奇，因楊主理《蘋果》的論壇版。至於蕭若元和雲海，陳稱二人並非由她推薦，但是她不記得當時為何會傳送給楊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又補充，Patreon 是一個供人發表文章的平台，如果讀者想閱讀某作者的文章，需要付費才能看到；她記得當時《蘋果》正在推行付費訂閱計劃，所以想了解在 Patreon 這種付費訂閱的模式下，有哪些作者較受歡迎和吸引到讀者，而黎喜歡劉細良的文章，因此記憶中她在這個情況下提及劉的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及3名作者的文章立場，陳指劉細良是「比較接近民主派的觀點」；蕭若元「都係點評吓時政，同埋對政府都係比較有批判性」；至於雲海，陳則坦言不太認識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英參與自由廣告二次創作&quot;&gt;黎智英參與「自由」廣告二次創作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示《蘋果》2020年5月4日的頭版廣告，顯示「自由」兩個大字，其中「自」字打橫放。頭版下方寫有「當自由變成罪，我們已退無可退」、「一群香港人於一百零一年後的五四」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aBptihI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示翌日欄目「隔牆有耳」，題為〈五四運動101周年 A1集體二創〉，可見多張「自由」廣告的「二次創作」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏指，「隔牆有耳」主要刊載一些軟性或不太認真的新聞，包括政圈或議會裡的一些八卦新聞。她舉例如財政預算案並不屬於軟性新聞，但是假設財政司司長太太的服裝顏色襯托財政預算案的顏色，便可視作軟性新聞來報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指其中一幅「二次創作」的署名為黎智英，畫中可見一顆巨大紅色星星壓倒在一個老人和一個年輕人身上。報導提及：「壹傳媒創辦人黎智英亦創作佢嘅 A1，『毀我法治自由，我一無所有』，八方相信呢個肯定係大多數港人嘅心聲。」控方問黎的創作和言論又是否屬於軟性新聞，陳則指上述不是重大新聞，而這也是黎一直以來的立場，所以同事並沒有以此作正式報導。陳又指參與「二次創作」的還有一些漫畫家和意見領袖（KOL），而黎只是其中一個人物。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另指報導署名是「李八方」，問陳「李八方」是誰。陳指「隔牆有耳」欄目通常由政治組同事撰稿，「八方」只是一個筆名，情況就如早前提及的「季陶」，不同的同事均會使用同一個筆名。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何政治組會用筆名來寫報導。陳指，首先「隔牆有耳」行文夾雜口語，與正統新聞報導使用書面語不同；而且政治組同事與政界朋友不時閒談，若果有一些八卦資訊或不能成為正式報導的題材，但是很有趣、「幾 juicy」，同事便會寫在「隔牆有耳」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎智英向陳沛敏查問彭定康語錄&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎智英向陳沛敏查問彭定康語錄&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示陳沛敏與黎智英之間的 WhatsApp 對話紀錄，陳於2020年5月6日向黎傳送彭定康的語錄：「我感到憂慮的，不是香港的自主權會被北京剝奪，而是這項權利會一點一滴地斷送在香港某些人手裏。」其後陳又傳送「除褲放屁—多餘，多此一舉」，黎回覆：「我用了畫蛇添足。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上解釋，估計黎正在撰寫文章，期間查問彭定康上述言論的原句，以及「多此一舉」的近義詞，於是她在網絡上搜尋，然後傳送給黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示黎智英的專欄文章，刊登於2020年5月10日，題為〈無賴在摧毀香港法治〉。文中提到：「彭定康說，香港主權會一點一滴斷送在某些人手裏，信焉。」文章又提到：「我和楊森、李卓人在2月28號被拘捕，被控非法集會罪，我另加一條刑恐罪，前幾天5月5號在西九龍裁判處過堂安排審訊程序。案件主控官一直對我方說，保釋條件不換。怎知，到開庭前5分鐘主控官卻反口，對我方律師說，她將會要求法官判決禁止我出境和每星期要到警署報到，顯然開庭前主控官收到了最高指示。法官徇主控官要求，有關刑恐罪判我禁止出境和每星期到警署報到。」、「我又不是殺人放火，是輕微控罪，在法庭未審判之前，我何罪有之？我是個無罪的無辜者，法庭是根據甚麼法理禁制我出境呢？況且，這案件之輕微，本人根本不可能僭逃，主控官如此苛刻的保釋條件極不合理。這顯然是常理法理都不合規格的指控。當然是另有原因了。這原因是甚麼？無謂畫蛇添足了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，黎當時有否提到他正在撰寫文章？陳稱黎沒有詳細跟她說，也不肯定有否簡單提及過。至於黎在法庭上被施加禁止離港的保釋條件，陳指黎沒有向她提及過此事，不過有提及過與《東方》記者之間的衝突事件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent high-profile cases from national and local security forces, as well as critical reviews of internal cultures, indicate that the UK’s security forces are under threat from far-right extremism. This paper addresses this challenge in the UK context, focusing on the police and military services, and offers practical guidance and recommendations. The analysis highlights the following four critical areas for reform:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vetting processes are essential. However, it seems that there remain significant gaps and challenges in effectively identifying potential extremists. This poses a considerable risk, particularly as far-right organisations strategically infiltrate security forces, exploiting organisational similarities and cultural overlaps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Training emerges as a critical area for prevention. The need for continuous, well-structured training programmes is emphasised, with a focus on addressing hypermasculinity and racism. Fostering a culture that counters stigma around mental health is also identified as a crucial factor in reducing radicalisation risk, aligning with the broader goal of building resilient and adaptive security forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accountability mechanisms within security forces are equally important, especially in the face of an evolving extremist threat. Transparency, consistency and leadership support in enforcing consequences for misconduct and extremist ideologies are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Separation from the police or military is identified as a critical phase of vulnerability to radicalisation. Comprehensive support programmes, including mental health assistance, exit interviews and tailored interventions, are highlighted as crucial for successful reintegration into civilian life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing these challenges is vital to building the resilience of the UK’s security forces against extremist influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the events of 6 January 2021 in the US, where former and active security service members participated in the attack on the country’s Capitol, and high-profile cases of service members engaging in far-right extremism in Germany, there has been a growing focus on the threat posed by serving and former security force members in these and other countries. This is especially the case in light of the shifting focus over the past few years to far-right extremism and terrorism as a predominant threat in these regions. Research into the phenomenon and prevention efforts addressing the issue of far-right extremism in national security services are underway in the US, Canada, Germany and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, instances of suspected far-right extremism among active and former members of the police and armed forces have led to referrals to the government’s Prevent scheme and investigations into far-right extremism-related concerns, as well as prison sentences both for membership of proscribed far-right organisations and attempts to recruit other members of the security forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cases underline the gravity of the issue, as even a small number of individuals within the security forces engaging in extremist activities poses a significant reputational risk to those forces. Links between service members and extremism present a profound threat to the foundations of democratic societies. When those sworn to protect and defend society are associated with extremism or terrorism, the societal trust they break with their actions has a deep impact, undermining institutions and the missions they are meant to uphold. Public trust is imperative for the effective functioning of the security services and their ability to carry out their mandates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the threat to public confidence, there is also the internal impact of diminshed trust within security services. Environments where racism, sexism and extremism are prevalent can hinder operational efficiency. If force personnel feel marginalised, harassed or attacked they will not be able to complete their duties to the best of their abilities. In addition, if marginalised or “out-group” communities (those people who do not belong to a specific “in-group”) do not feel the security services are a welcoming environment, future recruitment and retention will be increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to address this issue in the UK context, focusing on the police and the armed forces, to provide practical guidance to mitigate potential threats. It forms part of a broader RUSI project exploring structural, training and cultural dynamics within national security forces that can enhance or reduce resilience against the entrance and spread of far-right extremism. The paper is not intended to be comprehensive, but rather presents initial findings and actionable policy recommendations from this wider project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper first outlines the current situation in the UK, examining recent cases of and institutional responses to far-right extremism in the security forces. Subsequently, the paper discusses four areas of concern – vetting procedures, training and education, internal governance and separation processes – where adaptations of existing measures could enhance resilience to violent extremist influences. For each area, the paper explores current measures, discusses their limitations, and provides recommendations for building resilience, emphasising that the goal is not to stigmatise security service members but to safeguard their wellbeing and build resilience to violent extremism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-limitations&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY AND LIMITATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper took a qualitative approach, reviewing existing literature on extremism, with a focus on far-right extremism within the security services. This included a targeted review of current cases of violent extremism and terrorism investigations in the UK, encompassing both current and former service members. The paper builds on open source materials, grey and academic literature, and media reports. Additionally, insights are drawn from recent reviews into institutional cultures, such as the Baroness Casey Review of the Metropolitan Police Service (the Casey Review).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that there are significant limitations on access to primary data in this area of research. It is extremely difficult to interview serving members of the UK’s military and police on this subject, as they are bound by their service contracts. Consequently, information about cases of far-right extremism and preventive approaches within the security services is scarce. The lack of clear and published policies and documentation of procedures from these services compounds the challenge. The consequent reliance on media reporting introduces a potentially skewed picture, as cases reported may not have led to charges or legal action, due to insufficient evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these limitations, it is important to highlight that this paper does not claim to offer a comprehensive assessment of existing policies or cases. Rather, its purpose is to initiate a discussion within the UK context on the highlighted concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-and-context&quot;&gt;BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section identifies some of the key concerns for the UK’s military and police in relation to preventing far-right extremism from spreading through the ranks. External threats include infiltration by extremists, while internal threats include cultural dynamics which allow sentiments of misogyny and racism to fester and increase members’ vulnerability to far-right extremism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referrals to the UK government’s Prevent programme in relation to suspected far-right extremism have been made from across the armed forces, including the RAF air cadets and army cadets. Although up-to-date figures are not available, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has revealed that between 2019 and October 2022, 40 personnel from the Army, Navy and Air Force were investigated for extremism-related concerns. Defence Intelligence has also stated that of the 14 MoD Prevent referrals in 2019, 13 were related to far-right concerns. For January to November 2020, there were a further seven referrals, with the majority (six) linked to far-right activities. This follows the arrest of four serving members of the Army in 2017 for suspected membership of National Action, a proscribed far-right organisation. Lance Corporal Mikko Vehvilainen was subsequently sentenced to eight years in prison for membership of a proscribed organisation and attempts to recruit other soldiers. There have been similar concerns in relation to the police, after Benjamin Hannam became the first serving officer to be convicted of a terrorism offence – also related to membership of National Action – in 2021. The subsequent convictions of serving members of police and prison staff for terrorism offences linked to their far-right beliefs suggests that this threat extends beyond frontline officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee has warned about the “insider threat” of far-right extremists actively seeking to infiltrate and recruit within the military and the police. The government has acknowledged that the security forces present an attractive target for groups to gain training and access to weaponry and equipment, and as a site for recruitment. Well-known far-right extremists such as Jack Renshaw – currently serving life in prison for a plot to kill MP Rosie Cooper in 2017 – have attempted to join the armed forces. National Action has also directly encouraged members to enlist in the military or police and to conceal their views during the recruitment process. The idea of enlisting in the Army was also a frequent point of discussion in a Telegram channel run by “the British Hand” terrorist cell, with some members appearing to have joined the army cadets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Army has stated that far-right ideology is “completely at odds” with its values and standards. However, high-profile incidents in recent years appear to be indicative of a longstanding sympathy for far-right culture within elements of the armed forces. Former military personnel have not only stated that offensive and discriminatory language was commonplace, but that troops could display far-right iconography and brag about their exploits within far-right groups without fear of reprisals. Army veteran and “commanding officer” of the far-right National Support Detachment Alek Yerbury claims that his views were not only widely shared in the military, but also largely shaped during his time there. Other former members of the armed forces have suggested that dehumanising training approaches, often including racist language and stereotypes, can sometimes be used in the services training and can potentially contribute to radicalisation into far-right extremism. Worryingly, some allege that senior officers were not only aware of these behaviours, but that they also attempted to cover them up. An urgent report commissioned by the Secretary of State for Defence in April 2019 also casts doubt on the MoD’s accountability procedures, which were described as “a sub-optimal system” for dealing with inappropriate behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the police, there are similar concerns about cultures potentially conducive to far-right extremism and a lack of measures to effectively address such behaviours. In March 2023, an independent review of standards of behaviour in the Metropolitan Police (the Met) found an internal culture characterised by systemic and deep-seated racism, misogyny, homophobia and other forms of discrimination. The investigation also highlighted that such behaviours are routinely tolerated, ignored or dismissed as “banter” within a culture of defensiveness and denial that encourages officers and staff to look the other way rather than speak up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not only serving members of the military and police who present an extremism risk. Veterans motivated by far-right ideologies have been convicted of terrorism offences, including the stockpiling of explosives and preparation of attacks. Additionally, former service personnel can be targeted specifically by the recruitment strategies of far-right groups. Veterans have useful skills and experience – some have become responsible for training and fitness programmes in far-right organisations. Characteristics associated with military and police service, such as discipline, honour and courage, are viewed as valuable by far-right organisations. Individuals leaving the forces can lack support, including assistance with mental health needs resulting from their service, and may be at risk of being enticed by the sense of belonging and familiar organisational structure that far-right groups claim to offer. Far-right groups have attempted to exploit this vulnerability, directly contacting former service personnel via social media and charities. A “respite” camp for veterans has been accused of being a “major organising centre of the far-right attended by former soldiers who have shared antisemitic propaganda and threatened armed violence”. Recent years have also seen far-right groups in the UK renew their efforts to co-opt veterans into their narratives as part of a wave of anti-migrant protests, in particular contrasting the treatment of former service personnel with the money and luxuries allegedly afforded to asylum seekers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples give a sense of the threat facing the military and police in the UK from far-right extremism. It is important to note that further specificity in defining and mapping the threat was outside the scope of this paper, but it appears likely from the evidence gathered that these concerns have both institutional and specific, or local, dynamics. Therefore, it is also likely that particular police stations or regions might have more or fewer concerns in this area, depending on their leadership’s approach to how training, policies and culture are monitored and enforced. Within the military, it may be that there are differing levels of concern across the services or, more specifically, across particular roles within the services. Evidence shows that the more operationally focused the role within the security services, the more concern there can be about the cultural dynamics and in-/out-group mentality fostered within such units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-vulnerabilities-and-strengthening-resilience&quot;&gt;UNDERSTANDING VULNERABILITIES AND STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are some clear distinctions between the mission and culture of the police and the military in the UK, four areas of concern emerge across both services: vetting of new recruits; the training environments used to ingrain the hierarchal unit structures of the security services; the creation and enforcement of governance procedures for active members; and the services offered to departing members and veteran communities. For each of these areas, there follows a review of current measures in the UK services, an assessment of the limitations of these approaches, and recommendations to help improve the policy and practice of the military and the police to prevent and counter the threat of far-right extremism within their ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vetting&quot;&gt;VETTING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vetting processes play a crucial role in preventing far-right extremism within the security forces, primarily for two reasons. First, as discussed in the previous section, far-right organisations actively strategise to infiltrate security forces, viewing them as attractive targets to gain training and access to weaponry. Second, research suggests there are organisational and cultural parallels between far-right groups and security services, which could encourage recruitment to far-right extremism among current and former security force members. Shared features such as organisational hierarchies and gendered role expectations create potential appeal for individuals with far-right leanings. The archetype of a patriotic hero is prevalent in both types of organisation, with a potentially narrow gap between nationalist patriotism and ultra-nationalist viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Measures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military has stated that there are “robust measures” in place during their recruitment processes to identify and exclude individuals with extremist sympathies. Similarly, the police claim that all applicants will be subject to “rigorous vetting”. The vetting procedures of both forces rely heavily on recruits self-declaring or disclosing information – including any political or extremist affiliations – via written or online forms. This presents a potential vulnerability, as candidates may choose to withhold or conceal their beliefs. To counter this, the military cross-checks disclosed information against security service records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All branches of the armed forces additionally mandate interviews or assessment centres that candidates must physically attend. By contrast, national police assessment standards lack this requirement, with major forces such as the Met and West Midlands Police opting for online interviews and assessment centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond interviews, most police forces now increasingly scrutinise applicants’ social media profiles. Yet challenges persist in uniformly integrating this into vetting procedures. Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee found some resistance within police forces to incorporating in-depth online screening into standard vetting procedures because of resource and privacy implications. A former head of Counter Terrorism Policing also stated that “people don’t like the idea that their whole internet history is going to be looked at as part of their application for a particular job”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the military and the police have specific tattoo policies in relation to applicants, offering a screening opportunity for extremist affiliations. Applicants with “offensive or intimidating” tattoos are barred from joining the police. Army regulations similarly state that soldiers may not have tattoos that can be viewed as offensive, which the regulations define as having “the purpose or effect of violating another person’s dignity or creating an adverse environment for others … A tattoo should … be considered to have such an effect if … it can be viewed as offensive by an objective standard”. However, the lack of specific guidance on political symbols, iconography, references or proscribed images contrasts with internal Army guidance to soldiers to look out for individuals with “tattoos with overt and covert XRW [extreme right-wing] iconography”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the important role vetting can play in barring individuals with extremist views, recent high-profile cases demonstrate the limitations of existing vetting procedures in both the military and the police. For police recruitment, concerns were raised by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee and His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp;amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS), citing insufficient background checks and the appointment of applicants without adequate verification of the information provided on application forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the absence of standardised vetting questions across recruitment in police forces in England and Wales contributes to the potential for abuse of the process. Some forces ask applicants to declare that they are “not a current, or previous, member of a proscribed terrorist organisation”, while others refer to “domestic extremism groups”, or make reference to specific organisations such as the British National Party, Britain First, Combat 18 and the National Front. The College of Policing has developed a recommended question that asks applicants, “Have you ever been involved in any actions that could be described as politically, religiously, racially, or environmentally disruptive?”. The open wording of this model question retains ambiguity that might be abused, or even misunderstood, by applicants. However, an extremist candidate’s responses and omissions could nevertheless be considered evidence of fraudulent misrepresentation during vetting, which, if proven, could constitute gross misconduct and would be grounds for automatic dismissal under new police procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, ambiguity in questions, while not necessarily succeeding in preventing entry to security services by extremist elements, can provide leverage for potential discharge in disciplinary cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media screening, while potentially contributing to a more comprehensive candidate profile, faces practical challenges such as attribution issues, pseudonym use and unauthorised impersonation, all of which limit its efficacy. Additionally, discriminatory or extremist social media posts are sometimes overlooked or dismissed during the vetting process. After reviewing the applications of 725 serving police officers, HMICFRS found that 68 should never have made it through the vetting process. This includes instances where social media posts that were “potentially discriminatory, inflammatory, or extremist” did not result in the candidate being rejected, with some forces failing to refer to potentially problematic social media content at all in their decision-making. Rather, forces looked to address the issue by advising candidates on their use of social media in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differing “risk appetites” among police forces, influenced by recruitment targets, further compound the problem, with some forces granting “vetting clearance despite knowing disturbing information about applicants”. For example, the Met, even after being criticised in the Casey Review for inadequate vetting, is one of several forces to invite failed applicants to reapply, emphasising a complex balance between maintaining standards and meeting recruitment goals. This dynamic reflects a paradox whereby services that are struggling to recruit, in part as a result of perceptions of racism and sexism in their ranks, may relax vetting practices further to boost recruitment, potentially admitting individuals with undesirable attitudes and influences that perpetuate discriminatory cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Standardise and Enhance Vetting Procedures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish standardised vetting procedures across all branches of the military and police forces, ensuring consistent questions and criteria are used during the screening process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include in-person interviews as part of the national assessment standards for the police, providing opportunities to confirm, contextualise and clarify information provided by candidates on application forms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide comprehensive training and guidance to recruiters and vetting personnel on identifying potential extremist threats, including collaboration with Prevent teams and leveraging of specialist knowledge from experts in the field. There are subtleties and complexities in the symbology of far-right extremism, and non-experts or those without training might easily miss signs of affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Strengthen Online Screening&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implement more comprehensive and standardised online screening procedures for both military and police recruitment, incorporating lessons from extremist risk assessment frameworks used by security practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conduct thorough checks of social media profiles to identify any potential extremist affiliations, discriminatory content or inflammatory posts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Address privacy concerns by ensuring that the screening process is conducted in accordance with relevant legal and ethical guidelines and provide clear explanations to candidates about the purpose and scope of the screening.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Expand Reference and Social Circle Checks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognise the importance of gathering insights from individuals who can provide valuable information about the candidate’s background, behaviour and potential extremist affiliations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider conducting interviews with teachers or school staff, as well as reference checks and interviews with friends, family, colleagues, employers and relevant individuals from the candidate’s immediate social circle as part of the vetting process for both the military and the police.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish clear guidelines and protocols for conducting these interviews to ensure consistency, fairness and respect for privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Enhance Tattoo Policies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revise tattoo policies to include specific guidance and examples of proscribed symbols, iconography and references associated with far-right extremism, based on information from extremism experts and databases such as those developed by the Anti-Defamation League.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Train recruiting and vetting personnel on far-right culture, signs, symbols and terminology to enhance their ability to identify extremist tattoos and covert references.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Strengthen Oversight and Reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve oversight mechanisms to monitor the effectiveness and compliance of vetting procedures in the security forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure there are ethical barriers in place so that recruitment goals do not override vetting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish clear protocols for reporting concerns identified during vetting, enabling the security forces to make referrals to Prevent for individuals identified as potential extremists or vulnerable to extremism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implement ongoing vetting procedures and continue to develop processes to take appropriate action if individuals fail to meet the vetting criteria or if concerns arise post-recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;training&quot;&gt;TRAINING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training processes are essential in preventing far-right extremism in the UK security forces, by ingraining awareness and understanding of the threat, as well as providing environments for preventive interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that the very nature of training processes within the security forces may also contribute to the risk of far-right radicalisation. Basic or initial training serve as the initial point of engagement, embedding values. The bonding effect of a mix of both sanctioned and unsanctioned peer dynamics, isolation, initiation ceremonies, traditions or practices, discipline and even (controlled) violence is sometimes used to create a unit or “in-group”. If this environment or subsequent training environments are infused with discriminatory unit-building practices, this can lower resilience to extremism. Extreme forms of obedience training that instil a willingness to sacrifice one’s life for the collective may foster a toxic hierarchical culture, sense of allegiance to the group, and elitism that can in extreme cases be used to justify extremism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a common element of military training in relation to addressing the need to fight an enemy in defence of the state is “othering”, a formal or informal method used to dehumanise and vilify the enemy – which is seen by some as a tool to make it easier for troops to engage in combat and take lives. As discussed later in this section, dehumanising training methods, including the use of racist terms, have the potential to contribute to far-right radicalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Measures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Vehvilainen’s conviction, the MoD collaborated with the police and the Home Office to create specific Prevent training for the military. Defence Intelligence’s “Insider Threat” team also participated in joint training, and a policy in March 2019 introduced updates to armed forces training. Recruits in Phase One (basic training) establishments now receive a Prevent briefing, although its content remains unclear. The MoD also aims to raise awareness among key personnel about identifying signs of radicalisation and the Prevent referral process. In 2019, the MoD stated that all personnel would receive some form of Prevent training at least once, either in person or using Home Office-designed e-learning products, with the aspiration of making Prevent training mandatory annually for all personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMICFRS has found that while most police forces mandate Prevent training using e-learning packages for officers and staff, monitoring and recording of compliance varies among forces, leading to unknown completion rates. While this training likely enhances understanding of radicalisation signs and the Prevent referral process, HMICFRS highlights that the potential vulnerability of staff to extremism was generally excluded from forces’ Prevent training. Officers and staff also felt that e-training was less effective than that delivered in person by facilitators who could make training “directly relevant to the local policing environment”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2022 Ofsted review of welfare during armed forces’ initial training revealed that while trainees receive security briefings and complete Prevent training during induction, the depth and frequency of updates are insufficient for troop protection. The report recommends detailed and regular training for commanders to enhance understanding of potential national and local risks, including from online sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD’s 2019 Report on Inappropriate Behaviours found that mandated training on diversity, inclusion and values sometimes emphasised compliance over long-term behavioural and cultural change. Senior ranks’ under-representation in attendance was noted, and additional training on behaviours, ethics and culture and inclusion, although impactful, was found to not be uniformly deployed across all Defence forces. External stakeholders have suggested that there is a lack of skill and specialist knowledge among the armed forces to deliver training effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is the risk that the training processes within the security forces may even contribute to the risk of far-right radicalisation. A former soldier recruited by the Scottish Defence League claimed that dehumanising training processes, including racist terms, could contribute to radicalisation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the army it’s all “raghead this, raghead that” and those terms are used to make us think they are something different to us. You’re more likely to go kill them if that’s what you’ve been trained to think of them as. You’re brainwashed in the army to be more bigoted than racist and it plants that seed of hate in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A soldier from another regiment spoke of how he and his comrades would “other” everyone outside their battalion as “white P*kis”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military and police education and training environments are often the first line of engagement for new recruits, ingraining the service’s associated values in recruits. This type of education often continues throughout the period of service, with training environments serving to reinforce hyper-masculinised norms and role expectations within the ranks. These environments may contribute to susceptibility to far-right extremism. Humour and banter that may be misogynistic and racist is also part of in-/out-group formation, with gallows humour promoting in-group bonding. Examples of this can be seen in the various offensive WhatsApp groups in which police officers have been implicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Enhance Prevent Training&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide detailed and frequent Prevent training to all service personnel, ensuring they understand the potential national and local risks associated with extremism, including from online sources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailor training to service personnel’s understanding and experience of far-right extremism within their context.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide Prevent training regularly that specifically addresses emerging challenges and incorporate the most up-to-date intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include discussions on the signs of radicalisation, the Prevent referral process and the importance of vigilance in identifying potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include service personnel in the design and delivery of this type of training. Additionally, ensure that sustainable Training of the Trainers systems are established, so that effective engagement continues as individuals move in and out of training roles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Address Training Gaps and Limitations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve the depth and frequency of security briefings and Prevent duty training provided during induction to adequately protect personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implement comprehensive training that explores the potential negative implications of military training, including the risks of radicalisation and the impact of potentially dehumanising processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foster an environment where questions can be asked and addressed by trainers, recognising the limitations of e-training in effectively engaging trainees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure that trainers are equipped to deliver training and communicate effectively with the intended audience. Evidence shows that messengers are key to reception of the message.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Strengthen Values-Based Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shift the focus of training from compliance to long-term behavioural and cultural change, emphasising the importance of diversity, inclusion and values such as respect, equality and tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure that senior ranks actively participate in the training to set a positive example and promote a culture of inclusivity throughout the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Promote Critical Thinking and Ethical Decision-Making&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include modules on critical thinking skills and ethical decision-making, enabling security force members to navigate complex situations while upholding democratic values, human rights and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide training that encourages questioning of stereotypes, biases and extremist ideologies, promoting a culture of critical thinking and challenging extremist narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Gender-Sensitive, Intersectional Training&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incorporate gender-sensitive and intersectional training modules to address the unique challenges and vulnerabilities faced by individuals of different genders within the security forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide education on gender dynamics, stereotypes and biases to foster a more inclusive and respectful environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include discussions on the intersectionality of gender with other identities, such as race, religion and sexual orientation, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of diverse experiences and perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Regularly Evaluate and Update Training Programmes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conduct regular evaluations of training programmes to assess their effectiveness in countering far-right extremism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay informed about best practices, research and global trends in countering violent extremism to ensure training remains up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foster a culture of continuous learning and adaptability to effectively respond to emerging challenges and evolving threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance-and-accountability&quot;&gt;GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governance and accountability processes play a crucial role in preventing far-right extremism within the security forces, and are vital in identifying cases where recruits become disillusioned over time. Disillusionment not evident at the vetting stage may arise as new recruits with idealistic notions of their roles confront the harsh realities of work in the security forces, potentially leading to shifts in views and even extremism. The path from patriotic ideals to disillusionment, combined with nationalism and anti-government sentiment, can be driven in part by negative experiences or a perception of failure. These experiences may lead individuals to believe that political elites are not addressing “real problems”, fuelling grievances that can push them towards far-right violent extremism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, internal barriers to reporting concerns about extremism can pose a significant challenge. At the division level, it is often up to individuals who happen themselves to belong to an “out-group” to challenge discriminatory and/or extremist sentiments personally, which can result in bullying and suppression of reporting efforts. Military surveys reveal that senior leadership is often less aware than lower-ranked leadership of extremist sentiment within the ranks, potentially due to reduced interaction. Despite the importance of reporting being communicated and encouraged during training, it is often perceived as a betrayal of division unity, marking the individual as a disrupter and pushing them into the out-group. The severity of this sentiment varies across roles, with combat and special operations roles fostering stronger in-/out-group identities due to their reliance on division unity in life-or-death situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Measures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are governance and accountability measures in place in the police and military services, with both barring discriminatory attitudes and behaviours. Most UK police forces, mandated by Section 26(1) of the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015, are bound by the Prevent duty to identify and support individuals who may be vulnerable to radicalisation or involvement in terrorism. However, this does not apply to the MoD, despite calls for a review (including from service personnel themselves), particularly for military police dealing with internal risks presented by staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military police are responsible for investigating extremism-related concerns within the armed forces, with any suspicions about serving members reported in the first instance to civilian police, who then provide the military police unit with advice about appropriate follow-up actions. Defence Intelligence’s Counter Intelligence unit established its “Insider Threat” team in 2018 to counter far-right extremism threats, collaborating with Prevent teams and the police, “one of the only publicly known collaborations between a western military and a formal counter-radicalisation or de-radicalisation programme outside of the armed forces”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from referring individuals to Prevent, the MoD also retains responsibility for disciplining members who breach standards and values. An internal guide for Army officers emphasises reporting concerns related to possible far-right extremism through the chain of command and the Army Warning, Advisory and Reporting Point. This document appears to be part of a wider effort on the part of the MoD to stress to personnel that far-right extremism will not be tolerated, and to encourage vigilance and reporting of any concerns among personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the police investigate reports of individuals engaged in extremism, there is little evidence of specific policies that refer to potential insider threats. An HMICFRS inspection of the police’s contribution to the government’s Prevent programme in 2020 revealed a lack of consideration regarding colleagues’ vulnerability to or engagement in extremism, with few forces having safeguarding arrangements. Similarly, only two forces could provide examples of where they had used the Prevent referral process for members of staff thought to be vulnerable to extremism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the military has said that individuals exhibiting extremist views will be neither tolerated nor permitted to serve, enforcing this policy is complicated, due to unclear guidance on permitted political activities. A report from Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee in July 2022 highlights: “The fact that the Armed Forces do not provide clear direction to service personnel regarding membership of any organisation – let alone an extremist one – would appear to be something of an anomaly”, which it also describes as “a somewhat risky approach”. The government’s response states that MoD staff “are permitted to join non-proscribed groups if and when it is compatible with service values and standards”, and that members may “join political parties and attend political meetings in a personal capacity”. Service personnel, however, may not take part in political marches or demonstrations. This policy seemingly does not account for the increasingly post-organisational nature of the far-right extremist landscape (that is, the transition away from clearly structured organisations towards loose networks of individuals) nor the array of online forums that would not be banned under this definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have also been serious complaints about reporting procedures within the military. Two paratroopers who successfully sued the British Army in 2019 claimed that there was governance-level refusal to acknowledge the issue of far-right extremism and racist ideology, prompting their departure from the force. An MoD 2019 report similarly found existing processes to be inadequate, highlighting the need to “resource, develop and implement an anonymous tool for reporting inappropriate behaviours across Defence”. No progress had been made on this by the 2020 Progress Review, which also recommended the clarification of consequences for unacceptable behaviour, which are “currently not sufficiently visible for people to have confidence that action will be taken if they raise an issue”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Army has established a standard for automatic dismissal, stating that any soldier who receives a custodial sentence for offences related to far-right extremism will be discharged, even this threshold has presented challenges. For example, Royal Navy submariner Kenneth McCourt was not only allowed to remain in the Navy, despite the MoD having knowledge of his links to far-right organisations, but he has also since been promoted, including taking on responsibilities for the training of subordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Consider Inclusion of MoD in Prevent Duty and/or Enhance Collaboration Between MoD and Prevent Teams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conduct a comprehensive review to determine whether the responsibilities of relevant units within the MoD, such as military police forces handling internal risks, should be included under Prevent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthen collaboration between the MoD and Home Office Prevent teams by establishing formal channels for sharing information and concerns related to far-right extremism and potential insider threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facilitate regular communication and coordination to ensure a unified approach in addressing extremism concerns within the military.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Develop Clear Guidelines on Political Activities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide clear guidance to military personnel regarding political activities and the organisations with which they are permitted to engage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Define boundaries of and restrictions on political involvement, ensuring alignment with service values and standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarify consequences for engaging in unacceptable behaviours or having affiliations with extremist organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Strengthen Reporting Procedures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implement an anonymous reporting tool for reporting inappropriate behaviours, including extremist ideologies, across the security services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allocate sufficient resources to developing and implementing the reporting tool effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve existing reporting processes to ensure visibility and confidence that appropriate action will be taken in response to reported issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Review Disciplinary Measures and Discharge Policies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assess the effectiveness of current disciplinary measures and discharge policies in addressing far-right extremism and racist ideology within the security services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider revising discharge policies to ensure automatic dismissal for offences related to far-right extremism, including hate crimes and offences resulting in custodial sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Review and investigate cases where individuals with extremist links or convictions were allowed to continue serving and take appropriate action, including dismissal if warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;separation&quot;&gt;SEPARATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any significant transition point, such as entering or exiting service, creates the potential for radicalisation or deradicalisation resulting from the disruption of social structures and networks, which can lead to the challenge of ideological viewpoints. Additionally, far-right groups actively target veterans in their recruitment strategies for their useful skills in relation to planning and executing violent acts. Therefore, separation processes are an essential part of preventing far-right extremism in UK security forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of “identity fusion”, where personal identity becomes inseparable from the service identity, can pose challenges during separation and reintegration into civilian life. Masculinity expectations, along with stigma around seeking mental health help, may also hinder the transition. Recognising and addressing the practical and psychological impacts of separation is crucial, particularly for those leaving the security forces involuntarily. Grievances and inadequacies post-separation can lead to individuals seeking comfort in far-right militant organisations that might share some similarities in organisational hierarchy and cultural traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypermasculine environmental expectations can contribute to mental health difficulties such as post-traumatic stress disorder, and could be an indicator of susceptibility to extremism. This is especially true when an individual experiences difficulties transitioning out of service life or a feeling of struggle to maintain hypermasculinity, particularly for those who served in combat or special operations roles and/or in conflict zones. Further focus on the process of “unmaking” martialised masculinity is needed for the benefit of all veterans, but it is also important to remember that there are many intersectional identities held by service personnel that could impact their path in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Measures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the military and the police acknowledge the threat to former service personnel from extremist recruitment attempts, with direct targeting by far-right groups via social media and veteran support charities. These groups often draw upon narratives of betrayal of service members by the system, exemplified by stories about homeless veterans. The MoD’s 2019 Prevent policy covers serving personnel, veterans and individuals with links to the military, recognising the ongoing risk of radicalisation and recruitment into far-right extremism beyond active service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach taken in the UK, where civilian structures are involved in addressing cases of extremism within the military, contrasts with that of countries such as Germany, for example, where the Military Counterintelligence Service (Militärischer Abschirmdienst) takes the lead. The UK’s integrated approach, using expertise and lessons from various sectors of the government’s response to extremism, benefits from a broader range of resources and insights beyond the military domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forces such as Greater Manchester Police have implemented programmes to track returning soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan and have been flagged as potential extremism risks. While specific details about the extent of this police programme are limited, it represents a proactive effort to address potential risks associated with extremism among veterans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are seemingly fewer structural supports in place for separating or retiring police officers. While there may be non-public efforts by individual police forces or regions, the lack of public evidence of official programmes seems to indicate that the primary effort to support officers who might be experiencing mental or physical challenges with transitioning out of the service is conducted through independent charities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain limitations in current approaches to addressing far-right extremism among individuals transitioning out of the military. The case of Alek Yerbury, a self-professed far-right extremist who claims to have left the military due to his “hatred” of the government, reveals a missed opportunity for intervention. Yerbury states that he made his sentiments clear to his superiors during his one-year notice period before leaving the military. This raises questions about whether efforts were made to challenge his extremist views or to report the potential threat or his susceptibility to recruitment into far-right groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Prevent policy is designed to cover both serving personnel and veterans, a gap appears to exist (according to the available evidence) in interventions or referrals to Prevent when soon-to-be veterans exhibit concerning behaviours or express extremist ideologies. This gap is significant, especially considering that individuals in the process of transitioning out of the military may be at increased risk of recruitment into far-right extremism, as discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a range of resources across both the police and military services focused on supporting individuals’ mental and physical health, both during the transition and as veterans. However, these services should continue to be strengthened, especially for the police, for whom it appears there is not yet as much institutional support available. Additionally, these services should aim to be coherent and consistently improving across the different strategies being developed by the UK government and the three devolved legislatures of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Providing support, intervention and referral mechanisms during transitions could be crucial in mitigating recruitment risk and addressing underlying factors contributing to vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Support Transition and Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As well as delivering support programming, engage veterans in defining the challenges they face in transitioning out of a service. Evidence shows that credibility of the messenger is essential to effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implement comprehensive mental health and wellbeing programmes to address the stress, trauma and psychological challenges faced by security force personnel leaving service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop tailored resources and interventions to support individuals during the transition period, and provide ongoing mental health support for both serving personnel and veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognise and pre-empt, to the extent possible, the practical and psychological impacts and vulnerabilities associated with the point of separation from a security service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop targeted interventions that address the specific needs of individuals going through the transition process, taking into account the potential risks of radicalisation and the loss of personal identity tied to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish support programmes specifically designed for individuals who are involuntarily exiting the security services. These should address the unique challenges and vulnerabilities associated with involuntary exits, including feelings of grievance, loss of identity and potential susceptibility to radicalisation. Raise awareness of these particular risk dynamics with existing support services and networks/charities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Monitoring and Evaluation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regularly review and update separation procedures within the UK security forces to address the risks and vulnerabilities. Continuously assess their effectiveness in identifying and addressing far-right extremism risks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conduct comprehensive exit interviews with individuals to monitor potential risks and identify concerning behaviours or signs of extremist ideologies. This can provide an opportunity to gather information, address grievances and intervene where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implement monitoring mechanisms to track wellbeing and the reintegration progress, focusing in particular on individuals who have exited involuntarily. Regular check-ins, support networks and follow-up procedures can help identify and address emerging challenges or signs of vulnerability to radicalisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish mechanisms to monitor and evaluate the impact of programmes and interventions aimed at preventing and countering far-right extremism. Assess the effectiveness of mental health support programmes, transitional assistance initiatives and referral mechanisms to ensure they meet the needs of security force personnel and reduce the risk of recruitment into extremist groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addressing the complex and pressing challenge of far-right extremism within the UK security forces, a multidimensional strategy is essential, encompassing effective vetting, targeted training, robust accountability and dedicated support during the critical transition phase out of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current vetting procedures in the police and military face challenges in identifying and acting on potential extremism concerns, revealing gaps in the process and a failure to address identified extremist vulnerabilities in an appropriate manner. This represents a missed opportunity for early intervention and referral to appropriate services. Lessons from established counterterrorism risk assessment frameworks should inform improvements in vetting. Ongoing vetting is crucial to address evolving risks within the security forces, necessitating strengthened accountability to address threats effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ties in closely to the importance of training. There is a need to improve prevention-focused training as a regular service requirement, ensuring that trainers are adequately equipped to deliver this type of training. Lessons from existing courses for Prevent practitioners and other security sector partners can guide this process. Training programmes within security forces should integrate insights from research on hypermasculinity and racism. Training efforts should also target cultural issues contributing to mental health concerns. A supportive training environment encouraging help-seeking, addressing mental health stigmas and providing resources can reduce radicalisation risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on lessons from other police and military reforms, robust accountability processes are crucial, addressing misconduct, incompetence and extremist ideologies within the security forces. Enforcement of consequences, including dismissal for failure to maintain vetting status, is essential to the integrity and effectiveness of the security forces. These accountability processes should be transparent, consistent and supported by strong leadership to foster a culture of professionalism and prevent the tolerance of extremist views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition out of the police or military represents a critical phase when individuals may be vulnerable to radicalisation. It is important to recognise and pre-empt the practical and psychological impacts of the transition and provide comprehensive support programmes, encompassing mental health and wellbeing support, exit interviews to monitor potential risks and tailored interventions for individuals experiencing involuntary exits. By addressing the specific challenges faced during this transition, the security forces can reduce the risk of recruitment into far-right extremism and promote successful reintegration into civilian life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing these recommendations requires a comprehensive and integrated approach, drawing lessons from existing frameworks and practices while also adapting to the evolving nature of the threat posed by far-right extremism. Ultimately, such efforts will contribute to the resilience, safety, integrity and trustworthiness of the security forces, protecting both their personnel and the communities they serve.&lt;/p&gt;

As the battle for control continues, neither side can afford to surrender control of this vital area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-stalemate-and-renewed-sense-of-urgency&quot;&gt;A stalemate and renewed sense of urgency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine seems to become a more entrenched facet of the European security landscape, forces on both sides are increasingly faced with the potential of a stalemate. The Ukrainian counteroffensive could slow down even further in the near future, according to Michael Kofman, military analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA). The difficulty of conducting modern warfare at this scale was proved already by the Russians during the first stages of the war, in absence of any comparable defensive line. Even enthusiastic Western commentators have recently labelled Russian defence systems in Ukraine as “formidable”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether these efforts have, in fact, been formidable remains up for discussion. The invasion of Ukraine has shown that loitering munitions, drones, and hybrid warfare are able to create a stalemate through a preventive formation of sufficient fighting mass. This has also been echoed by Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who recently conceded that, as in World War I, the level of technology on either side precludes prospects for a “deep and beautiful breakthrough.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alleged slowing down of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, in conjunction with limited active Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) defence along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line near Avdiivka, have the potential to postpone a Ukrainian victory. From an alliance politics perspective, the counteroffensive was instrumental for showing Western partners that their economic and military commitments were worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1C96Zgx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ This chart shows some of the major factors influencing Ukraine’s current sense of urgency in its war against Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limited successes of the counteroffensive, when coupled with the uncertainty around Ukrainian casualty rates and President Zelensky’s internal struggles against corruption, however, have all aligned with (and potentially contributed to) wavering support from the West compared to the first months of the invasion. US support was already on rockier ground before, as claimed by Zelensky, Western attention returned to the Middle East. The EU is grappling with its own internal struggles, such as Poland’s response to the diversion of Ukrainian grain through mainland Europe instead of maritime export routes. Other European countries have also threatened to suspend aid in response to the diversion as well. This setback is due to Russia’s weaponisation of Ukraine’s grain exports, echoing Stalin’s utilisation of grain and hunger as political instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the stability required for any renewed Russian efforts may be in question. Recently, Vladimir Putin appeared on Chinese media declaring that he wants a different world order, dissimilar from the one envisioned by “countries with colonial legacies”. Internally, this translated into a series of repressive actions, such as sentencing artists, monitoring academics connected to foreign institutions, banning the “international LGBT movement”, and sacking a Natural Resources Ministry Official on grounds of corruption. The dubious death of Yevgeny Prigozhin and other Wagner Group associates also sent ripples through domestic channels otherwise supportive of the war. More recently, a former Russian Air Force Commander, Vladimir Sviridov, and his wife were found dead without explanation. Reassuringly, the Federal Security Service (FSB) officers are investigating. These repressive tactics are familiar staples of Russian autocratic measures dating back to at least the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to say whether these are symptoms of a greater problem, although it is worth recalling how frequently despotic emperors have been deposed by their Praetorian Guards. All of these measures, however, do coincide with the Russian population’s digestion of the current situation on the ground in Ukraine; as of late May 2023, roughly 47,000 Russian men under the age of 50 died in the war, and this is according to conservative estimates. As the military analyst Anders Puck Nielsen pointed out, this is already more than three times the number of the total casualties the Soviet Union (with 260 million inhabitants as of 1979) experienced during the ten years war in Afghanistan (which means roughly 1,500 dead per year in Afghanistan, as opposed to at least approximately 30,000 per year in this war) – a war which has often been claimed to be one of the major reasons for the Soviet Union’s economic and political collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TTnr4rZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ This chart shows some of the more noteworthy developments influencing Russian internal and external security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Ukrainian dream of a quick ousting of Russia’s invasion further fades into preparations for a longer conflict, time is of the essence for both sides, before factors beyond the battlefield begin to erode momentum. Therefore, it makes sense that Kyiv and Moscow will expand their scopes beyond the arena of land warfare to see where other gains might be made. One such arena—the Black Sea—has already seen its fair share of action, but may very well become a revisited point of priority in the next phases of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s initial maritime attacks on Ukraine’s coastline, including the infamous encounter at Snake Island and its most recent retreat from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, show how maritime logistics have remained a crucial strategic facet of the war. The land warfare aspects of the invasion have created the conditions for a war of attrition, which requires a whole-of-society commitment to sustain supply lines, infrastructure and production capacity. World War I ended on the eastern front, in part, because of a lack of resources that ultimately led to revolution and capitulation. In Russia’s approach to its invasion, maritime logistics have proved equally pivotal, as evidenced by recent events in the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-strategic-importance-of-the-black-sea&quot;&gt;The strategic importance of the Black Sea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic importance of the Black Sea lies primarily in its logistical value for Russia. The AFRF rely heavily on railroads and specialised brigades, such as the Material Technical Support brigades, for maintaining supply chains. However, these landbound brigades face challenges in meeting the demands required for sustained invasion efforts, such as capacity for physically transporting military goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the role of maritime logistics. Large cargo vessels are an easy remedy the difficulty of moving large quantities of supplies over land. With Russia’s closest ports to Ukraine being in the Black Sea, uninhibited access to these ports is essential for Russia’s military operations and heavily incentivises Russia to maintain a strategic advantage at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This value has not been lost on the Kremlin. Russia has already used its Black Sea power to impose a blockade against Odessa, Ukraine’s major port and primary hub for its grain exports. Russia’s Navy continuously targets grain depots in Odesa to eliminate Ukraine’s economic prowess, having allegedly destroyed at least 300,000 tons of grain. Additionally, Russia’s presence in the Black Sea provides the AFRF with a strategic vantage point for launching missile attacks. The Black Sea is also a major Russian hub for exporting oil and other critical goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it is no surprise that Russia would go to great lengths to maintain its operations through the Black Sea, even by using a fleet of “special ships” that violate international maritime law to procure military goods from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-sparta-iv-a-case-study-in-russias-prioritisation-of-black-sea-logistics&quot;&gt;The SPARTA IV: A case study in Russia’s prioritisation of Black Sea logistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fleet is owned by the sanctioned Oboronlogistics LLC, a company owned by the Russian MoD and connected to the Chief Directorate for Troop Accommodations JSC, which shares close ties to Russian oligarch Timur Vadimovich Ivanov, deputy Ministry of Defense and close ally of Putin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lqF2zvE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ SPARTA IV – Layout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fleet includes ships including the SPARTA II, PIZMA and SPARTA IV that appear to transport Russian military equipment from Syria to Novorossiysk, one of Russia’s main Black Sea ports. According to the Center of Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the SPARTA IV specifically even moved howitzers and other artillery pieces. Throughout 2023, these ships appeared to frequently ferry military goods to and from the Middle East, while Putin made his interests clear through renewed arms purchases with Iran, and senior-level meetings with Iranian and Hamas leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oboronlogistics’ fleet is not stopped in the Bosporus because of the grey legal area in which they play, and they prove Ukrainian efforts insufficient. On 28 February 2022, just four days after the beginning of the invasion, Turkey closed the Bosporus to all military vessels. However, Turkey’s decision to do this was no small action, as the Montreux Convention holds Turkey accountable if the country appears to misuse this ability. The Montreux Convention defines the preconditions necessary for Turkey to restrict movement through the Bosporus, the restrictions Turkey may impose on vessels if these preconditions are met, and the limits of Turkey’s ability to impose restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey may only restrict freedom of navigation through the Bosporus if it is a belligerent, it perceives to be threatened, or has legal obligation to aid a belligerent. It can only restrict warships and auxiliary vessels, and it must still permit daytime passage to these vessels when they are formally stationed in the Black Sea, so long as the passage is announced in advance by the vessels. Turkey cannot restrict commercial vessels, and it is not guaranteed the right to check the cargo of ships transiting the Bosporus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the loophole Russia uses. By operating assets such as the SPARTA IV as commercial vessels, the ships are not beholden to the same ones applied by Turkey to military ships. However, an investigation conducted by the team (with other analysts converging in the assessment) revealed that these ships are actually possibly equivalent to auxiliary vessels transporting military materiel through the Bosporus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the ability of these ships to enter and exit the Black Sea freely, Ukraine appears to have paid close attention to these vessels. Since the Ukrainian Navy lost all its limited capability in the very early days of the war, Ukraine seems to have pivoted to guerrilla war, employing asymmetric tactics and capabilities wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2023, Ukraine even used unmanned surface vessels (USVs) to target the SPARTA IV’s alleged military escort on one voyage, and changes in behaviour of the Russian vessels (such as diversions in sailing routes and the obfuscation of AIS tracking signals) indicates that the fleet was cautious to avoid detection or confrontation. Reliance on unmanned platforms at sea, however, is a different business than doing so on land. While the use of USVs is as old as World War I, a persistent difficulty in their use is the inability employ them at a distance, making destroyers and military escorts reliable assets in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VpxPF5H.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ USVs then and now. The chart shows the size difference between a 1915 Imperial German Fenlenkboote and a 2023 Ukrainian USV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Russian military capability currently provides sufficient protection to allow Oboronlogistics’ fleet to avoid both international law and USVs at the same time. Moreover, the Russian navy, though suffering maritime losses unmatched in the West since World War II (including the loss of the Moskva Project 1164 Atlant guided-missile cruiser and the Rostov-on-Don Project 636.3 Improved Kilo-class submarine – an historical achievement in itself) was nonetheless able to hamper the Black Sea corridor, where Ukrainian civilian cargo vessels were trying to resist the Russian pressure over the movement of grain, to the point of halting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as the Vietnamese and guerrilla fighters in Algeria knew very well, the reality is that nobody likes guerrilla warfare. In the 1975 film “The Battle of Algiers”, when being questioned by a French journalist on the practice of planting explosives in baskets, the fictional Algerian guerrilla leader Ben M’Hidi replies: “Obviously, planes would make things easier for us. Give us your bombers, monsieur, and you can have our baskets.” As declared by sources in Russia, the war in 2024 could renew the Russian attempt to take over the coast and Odessa. Ukraine and its allies must be prepared – losing the battle for the Black Sea is simply not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defeating Russia’s attempt to subjugate Ukraine must be based upon an understanding of what Russia is trying to achieve, how it is intending to achieve its objectives, and its capacity to implement this plan. The Russian theory of victory has been through various iterations over the course of the war, but Moscow now has a clear plan for how it intends to proceed. This article seeks to outline Russia’s intent in order to provide a basis for planning how its plan can be disrupted. Outlining Russian intent and capacity does not represent an assessment as to the likelihood of it succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-strategic-objectives&quot;&gt;Russian Strategic Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia still maintains the strategic objective of bringing about the subjugation of Ukraine. It now believes that it is winning. Surrender terms currently being proposed by Russian intermediaries include Ukraine ceding the territory already under Russian control along with Kharkiv, and in some versions Odessa; agreeing not to join NATO; and maintaining a head of state approved by Russia. The only significant concession Russia proposes is that what is left of Ukraine can join the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process by which Russia aims to bring about this outcome is in three stages. The first requires the continuation of pressure along the length of the Ukrainian front to drain the Armed Forces of Ukraine’s (AFU) munitions and reserves of personnel. Parallel to this effort, the Russian Special Services are tasked with breaking the resolve of Ukraine’s international partners to continue to provide military aid. Once military aid has been significantly limited such that Ukrainian munition stocks become depleted, Russia intends to initiate further offensive operations to make significant – if slow – gains on the battlefield. These gains are then intended to be used as leverage against Kyiv to force capitulation on Russian terms. The planning horizon for the implementation of these objectives, which is providing the baseline for Russian force generation and industrial outputs, is that victory should be achieved by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital to appreciate that Russian goals may expand with success, and given that the Kremlin has violated almost all significant agreements both with Ukraine and NATO, there is no assurance that even if Russia got what it wanted out of negotiations it would not subsequently endeavour to physically occupy the rest of Ukraine or be emboldened to use force elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-military-capacity&quot;&gt;Russian Military Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian military began 2023 with a highly disorganised force in Ukraine comprising approximately 360,000 troops. By the beginning of the Ukrainian offensive in June 2023, this had risen to 410,000 troops and was becoming more organised. Over the summer of 2023, Russia established training regiments along the border and in the occupied territories and, following the mutiny of Wagner forces, endeavoured to standardise its units, breaking down the previous trend towards private armies. By the beginning of 2024, the Russian Operational Group of Forces in the occupied territories comprised 470,000 troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While Russian force quality is unlikely to increase so long as the Ukrainians can maintain a significant level of attrition across the force, the Russians will be able to maintain a steady tempo of attacks throughout 2024&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces have reverted above battalion level to the traditional Soviet order of battle of regiments, divisions and combined arms armies, but have been significantly altered below the level of the regiment. Battalions are organised as line and storm battalions, and tend to operate in company groups which fight in small, dispersed detachments. This reflects not only adaptation to battlefield conditions, but also the shortage of trained officers able to coordinate larger formations, with a significant proportion of Russian junior officers currently being promoted from the ranks and receiving condensed officer training, sometimes as short as two months long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian Group of Forces continues to take significant casualties, but is nevertheless growing in size. Operating at greater scale allows the Russian military to take measures that guarantee the integrity of the front line. Units can generally be rotated out of the line once they have taken up to 30% casualties – the point at which they are judged to be ineffective – and are then regenerated. While no large-scale offensive is currently taking place, Russian units are tasked with conducting smaller tactical attacks that at minimum inflict steady losses on Ukraine and allow Russian forces to seize and hold positions. In this way, the Russians are maintaining a consistent pressure on a number of points. Although the Russian military’s aspiration to increase in size to 1.5 million personnel has not been realised, recruiters are currently achieving almost 85% of their assigned targets for contracting troops to fight in Ukraine. The Kremlin therefore believes that it can sustain the current rate of attrition through 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of combat equipment, the Russian Group of Forces holds approximately 4,780 barrel artillery pieces, of which 20% are self-propelled; 1,130 MLRS; 2,060 tanks; and 7,080 other armoured fighting vehicles, primarily consisting of MT-LBs, BMPs and BTRs. These continue to be supported by 290 helicopters, of which 110 are attack helicopters, and 310 fast jets. These equipment sets are limited in how they can be employed by ammunition shortages, especially for key natures like 220 mm multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and fluctuating availability of 152mm ammunition. Some sets, like fast air, are constrained by the availability of pilots with sufficient experience to carry out key missions. Russian air crew losses – including operators in the Il-20 Coot and A-50U Mainstay, shot down – amount to 159 personnel, which given the unevenness of flight hours in Russian squadrons amounts to a serious loss of capability. Nevertheless, the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) can continue to mount a significant sortie rate and deliver stand-off munitions. The overall assessment is that while Russian force quality is unlikely to increase so long as the AFU can maintain a significant level of attrition across the force, the Russians will be able to maintain a steady tempo of attacks throughout 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-industrial-capacity&quot;&gt;Russian Industrial Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of Russian industry’s capacity to support ongoing operations, Russia has significantly mobilised its defence industry, increasing shifts and expanding production lines at existing facilities as well as bringing previously mothballed plants back online. This has led to significant increases in production output. For example, Russia is delivering approximately 1,500 tanks to its forces per year along with approximately 3,000 armoured fighting vehicles of various types. Russian missile production has similarly increased. At the beginning of 2023, for instance, Russian production of Iskandr 9M723 ballistic missiles was six per month, with available missile stocks of 50 munitions. By the beginning of 2024, not only had Russia used a significant number of these missiles each month since the summer of 2023, but it had increased its stockpile to nearly 200 Iskandr 9M723 ballistic and 9M727 cruise missiles. A similar picture can be observed across other core missile types like the Kh-101.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these achievements, Russia faces significant limitations in the longevity and reliability of its industrial output. Of the tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles, for example, approximately 80% are not new production but are instead refurbished and modernised from Russian war stocks. The number of systems held in storage means that while Russia can maintain a consistent output through 2024, it will begin to find that vehicles require deeper refurbishment through 2025, and by 2026 it will have exhausted most of the available stocks. As the number of refurbished vehicles goes down, industrial capacity can go into making new platforms, but this will necessarily mean a significant decrease in vehicles delivered to the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia has significantly mobilised its defence industry, increasing shifts and expanding production lines at existing facilities as well as bringing previously mothballed plants back online&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another vulnerability for Russia’s complex weapons like missiles is the extensive dependence on Western-sourced components. Although Russia has maintained a steady supply of the necessary components owing to the incoherent and lackadaisical approach to sanctions adopted by Western states, a more coherent approach to countering the Russian defence industry could disrupt supply lines. Even with the existing flawed approach, the cost of components has risen by 30% for the Russian defence sector, and it has only managed to stabilise supplies rather than expand them, despite extra investment in this line of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most serious limitation for Russia, however, is ammunition manufacture. In order to achieve its aspiration to make significant territorial gains in 2025, the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) has assessed an industrial requirement to manufacture or source approximately 4 million 152mm and 1.6 million 122mm artillery shells in 2024. Russian industry has reported to the MoD that it expects to increase 152mm production from around 1 million rounds in 2023 to 1.3 million rounds over the course of 2024, and to only produce 800,000 122mm rounds over the same period. Moreover, the Russian MoD does not believe it can significantly raise production in subsequent years, unless new factories are set up and raw material extraction is invested in with a lead time beyond five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that to properly resource the armed forces, Russia must – in the short term – further draw down its remaining 3 million rounds of stored ammunition, though much of this is in poor condition. To further compensate for shortages, Russia has signed supply and production contracts with Belarus, Iran, North Korea and Syria, with the latter only able to provide forged shell casings rather than complete shells. Although the injection of around 2 million 122mm rounds from North Korea will help Russia in 2024, it will not compensate for a significant shortfall in available 152mm munitions in 2025. Russian overall artillery production is likely to plateau at 3 million rounds per year of all natures – including MLRS, which is not considered above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian theory of victory is plausible if Ukraine’s international partners fail to properly resource the AFU. However, if Ukraine’s partners continue to provide sufficient ammunition and training support to the AFU to enable the blunting of Russian attacks in 2024, then Russia is unlikely to achieve significant gains in 2025. If Russia lacks the prospect of gains in 2025, given its inability to improve force quality for offensive operations, then it follows that it will struggle to force Kyiv to capitulate by 2026. Beyond 2026, attrition of systems will begin to materially degrade Russian combat power, while Russian industry could be disrupted sufficiently by that point, making Russia’s prospects decline over time. The latter would require Ukraine’s partners to demonstrate a semblance of competence in their measures aimed at countering Russian defence mobilisation, which remains eminently possible in spite of their performance to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopting an approach that aims to ensure Ukraine’s resistance through 2025 not only undermines the Kremlin’s theory of victory but also provides sufficient time to establish a rational mobilisation and training process for the AFU such that it can begin to qualitatively outmatch Russian forces, even if the latter continue to increase in overall size. This is critical to building opportunities to continue to threaten Russia’s position and thereby force Russia not just to seek negotiations, but to actually negotiate an end to the war on terms favourable to Ukraine. Now is not the time to comply with the Kremlin’s understanding of the war’s trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

But there are reasons for both parties to refrain from escalating further.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep into its fourth month, Israel’s offensive in Gaza remains in an intense phase of operations. While the US assesses that approximately 30% of Hamas’s fighting force has been killed, the Israeli government has little to brag about in terms of achieving its two main objectives: eradicating Hamas and freeing the approximately 130 hostages under the group’s control. Forced to juggle between far-right ministers who label any compromise with Hamas as defeatism and the families of the hostages, for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the war remains an albatross around his neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet as difficult as Gaza’s operating environment is, the simmering conflict 130 miles to the north has the potential to be even worse. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hizbullah have spent the last four months engaged in a low-level, undeclared war, characterised by an incessant tit-for-tat that has produced casualties on both sides. The Israel–Lebanon border region, governed over the last 17 years by an informal arrangement that has deterred Israel and Hizbullah from replaying their full-scale conflict in 2006, is now increasingly fragile. The outstanding question is whether the war of words between senior Israeli and Hizbullah officials will, over time, become a shooting war that could compel Israeli troops to enter Lebanese territory, in what would be Israel’s fourth major ground incursion into Lebanon in 46 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israels-muddled-history-in-lebanon&quot;&gt;Israel’s Muddled History in Lebanon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israeli military operations inside Lebanon are hardly unprecedented. On 14 March 1978, the IDF launched an invasion of Southern Lebanon to push the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) north of the Litani River, 18 miles from the Israel–Lebanon border. The military campaign was instigated by a PLO terrorist attack that took place three days earlier, in which militants infiltrated Israel from the sea, took control of a bus and killed 35 Israeli tourists. The IDF would withdraw later that year on the assurance that UN peacekeepers and Israel’s Christian militia partners would exercise security control over the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years later, in June 1982, the IDF conducted an even larger ground offensive into Lebanon, taking Israeli troops all the way to Beirut. The mission was similar to the previous incursion in 1978: destroying PLO infrastructure, bolstering the security of civilians living in Northern Israel and demolishing the PLO as a fighting force. The invasion was a mixed bag: although PLO leader Yasser Arafat was exiled to Tunisia and a buffer zone was established in Lebanon’s south, the entire operation cost Israel significant international support due to the extent of the destruction. Israel’s relations with the US were put under strain. President Ronald Reagan was lukewarm on Israel’s policy and told the Israeli prime minister at the time, Menachem Begin, that a foray into Lebanon would cause “serious complications” for US–Israel relations as a whole. The IDF would later pull back to Southern Lebanon in 1985 and consolidate its positions there, beginning a long, costly and politically unpopular occupation that would eventually conclude with a full Israeli withdrawal in 2000. Hizbullah would be the ultimate beneficiaries, taking territory south of the Litani River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israelis also mounted smaller operations throughout this period, utilising air power in an attempt to degrade Hizbullah’s military capacity – most specifically the organisation’s rocket capability. In 1993, after Hizbullah killed five Israeli soldiers, Israel launched Operation Accountability, a week-long air campaign against Hizbullah infrastructure in Southern Lebanon and the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley. In 1996, the IDF engaged in a 16-day bombardment against Hizbullah (Operation Grapes of Wrath) to stem rocket attacks into Northern Israel. Lebanon’s ports were blockaded in a bid to stop weapons flows to Hizbullah, and the IDF conducted its first airstrikes in Beirut since the 1982 invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-second-lebanon-war&quot;&gt;The Second Lebanon War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the most extensive Israeli engagement in Lebanon occurred in the summer of 2006. On 13 July, Hizbullah militants infiltrated the border into northern Israel, abducting two Israeli soldiers and killing three others. While Hizbullah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah sought to use the Israeli soldiers as bargaining chips for the release of prisoners in Israel, such an exchange was simply inconceivable for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Hizbullah’s daring mission into Israel served as a casus belli for the IDF to initiate a comprehensive military campaign against the Lebanese terrorist group – one that would be far larger in scale and scope than the 1993 and 1996 engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Israeli intelligence and military establishment recognises that Hizbullah is much more militarily capable and politically powerful today than it was in 2006&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF not only targeted Hizbullah rocket-launching sites, command-and-control nodes and weapons storage facilities, but also took aim at Lebanese civilian infrastructure. Beirut International Airport was put out of commission; Lebanon was blockaded by sea; and Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hizbullah’s headquarters were based, were destroyed. Similar to past campaigns, Israel’s international support depreciated the longer the fighting went on. After first rejecting a ceasefire, George W Bush’s administration later pressed the Israeli government to accept one. On 11 August, the UN Security Council approved Resolution 1701, which called for a full cessation of hostilities by the combatants, a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Lebanese territory, Hizbullah’s withdrawal north of the Litani River, and the deployment of UN and Lebanese army troops to maintain the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the conventional wisdom is that the 2006 war in Lebanon ended in a loss for Israel, the reality is more nuanced. The IDF’s performance was lacking in key areas, no doubt. The Olmert government’s objectives for the campaign – getting the two Israeli hostages back and crushing Hizbullah as a fighting force – were maximalist to the point of being unattainable. As the Winograd Commission concluded in 2008, “Israel initiated a long war, which ended without its clear military victory”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel, however, wasn’t without its achievements. In the short term, Hizbullah’s military capacity was degraded. The volley of rocket fire into Northern Israel fell exponentially after the war. Deterrence was established along the Israel–Lebanon border, with Israel and Hizbullah both concluding that the costs of another round of major fighting were too high and wouldn’t serve their respective interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deterrence-is-holding--for-now&quot;&gt;Deterrence is Holding – For Now&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 17-year-old arrangement has frayed ever since Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel. The Israel–Lebanon border region resembles a warzone, albeit one that hasn’t been officially declared by the combatants. Israel’s air defence system shoots down Hizbullah drones and anti-tank missiles daily, and Israeli airstrikes target various Hizbullah locations just as frequently. On 23 January, Hizbullah claimed responsibility for a missile attack on the Meron airbase in what the group said was retaliation for Israel’s assassinations of Hizbullah operatives in Lebanon and Syria. Israel has increasingly taken to using precision strikes against individual Hizbullah fighters, the most significant thus far being the 8 January assassination of Wissam al-Tawil, a commander of Hizbullah’s Radwan Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big question on the minds of Israeli, Lebanese, Hizbullah and US policymakers is whether the limited spats will expand beyond the border region. There is good reason to believe that deterrence between Israel and Hizbullah still holds up well. The Israeli intelligence and military establishment recognises that Hizbullah is much more militarily capable and politically powerful today than it was in 2006. Estimates of Hizbullah’s rank-and-file numbers range from 50,000 to 100,000. The group’s missile arsenal, complete with precision-guided anti-tank missiles, medium-range rockets and Fateh 110 projectiles, is formidable; some are able to reach any part of Israeli territory, effectively locking the entire country down in the event of major hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hizbullah has reasons to stay away from an all-out war with Israel as well. First, Lebanon’s economy is in such a depressed state that any conflict would wipe out whatever economic potential it has left by scaring away investors, eliminating tourist flows and heightening reconstruction costs that Lebanon already can’t afford, putting the country on a path to long-term financial destitution. The civilian casualties would be significant, and given the political polarisation within Lebanese politics today, Hizbullah would be foolish to assume that its current political position would survive intact. Nasrallah isn’t immune to political considerations; in addition to being a militant outfit, Hizbullah is also a political movement with seats in the Lebanese parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;All the major players appear to recognise that diplomacy is the most effective way to defuse the Israel–Hizbullah standoff, if not permanently then at least peacefully&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran, Hizbullah’s primary patron, must also be taken into account. Despite the Islamic Republic’s incessant anti-Israel statements and its material support for its proxies in the region, Tehran is unlikely to support Hizbullah stumbling into a war with Israel. Such a scenario would severely jeopardise Iran’s strategy of distancing itself from the current fighting. While US military intervention on Israel’s behalf is hardly guaranteed, Iranian officials can’t rule out the prospect of Washington becoming a party to an Israel–Hizbullah war. If that did come to pass, Iran would then have two options: fighting a much superior adversary in the US to defend its Lebanese proxy or staying on the sidelines, thereby ruining its credibility as a reliable ally. Tehran would prefer not to have to make that choice at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tempers-flare&quot;&gt;Tempers Flare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, it would be irresponsible to rule out conflict entirely. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is so concerned about the Israel–Lebanon border that he has warned about the clashes possibly triggering a regional war. As risky as another Israel–Hizbullah war would be, there’s also a risk for Netanyahu and his coalition government in tolerating Hizbullah’s access to the border, which gives the group a degree of coercive leverage in its dealings with Israel. Israeli politicians and military officers see the status quo, which has pushed approximately 100,000 Israelis from their homes, as politically and economically unsustainable. The fact that tens of thousands of civilians are unable to return is an embarrassing eye sore for Netanyahu and a daily example of his government’s weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s therefore no surprise that Israel is becoming more aggressive in its rhetoric. Israeli officials have reiterated that they would prefer to remove Hizbullah from Southern Lebanon diplomatically but haven’t ruled out the military option if talks grind to a halt. IDF Chief of Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi was blunt when he recently visited troops in the north: “I don’t know when the war in the north is. I can tell you that the likelihood of it happening in the coming months is much higher than it was in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US would be wrong to interpret these words as mere bluster – and to its credit, it hasn’t. President Joe Biden has already talked Netanyahu out of ordering a massive pre-emptive strike against Hizbullah, but the probability of one hasn’t gone away entirely. As repeatedly demonstrated during Israel’s periodic interventions in Lebanon, the military option entails a lot of risks, and the rewards are anything but certain. Just as Israel’s Gaza operation won’t eliminate Hamas completely, an even bigger (and costlier) military operation in Lebanon is even less likely to eliminate Hizbullah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the major players appear to recognise that diplomacy is the most effective way to defuse the Israel–Hizbullah standoff, if not permanently then at least peacefully. The US has spent months trying to mediate a solution, using Lebanese officials as intermediaries to Hizbullah to work out possible formulations. To date, Israel and Hizbullah’s terms remain irreconcilable; the Israelis want Hizbullah to fully implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which requires Hizbullah to pack up and move north of the Litani River. Hizbullah is adamant that no diplomatic resolution is possible until the war in Gaza ends. US attempts to find a middle ground – including a proposal that would compel Hizbullah to withdraw four miles from the border – have been rejected, although Nasrallah has kept the door open to talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Israel and Hizbullah sticking to their positions and showing little willingness to compromise, even the most talented mediator would have trouble crafting a mutually acceptable formula. The US shouldn’t give up on backchannel diplomacy. But it also needs to be brutally realistic about what it can accomplish under the present circumstances. The best strategy, at least for the short term, is conflict management. A full resolution of disputes between these two historical adversaries may not be on the cards right now, but that doesn’t preclude the US, its allies and partners from doing what they can to prevent the flare-ups from escalating further. For the US, this requires talking tough to Israel behind closed doors, making it abundantly clear that Washington doesn’t support a pre-emptive Israeli strike under any circumstances and won’t automatically come to Israel’s defence in the event of one. The US, either directly or through the Europeans, Qatar or Oman, should also press Iran to deliver a similar message to its Hizbullah proxy. Given Iran’s desire to avoid direct participation in a regional war, Tehran might be receptive to such a request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（20日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第29日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。庭上提及《蘋果》高層於2020年5月開始籌備英文版，陳沛敏憶述黎智英曾提及「如果有美國政治人物訂閱，咁就好喇」，希望英文版能為《蘋果》起到保護作用，當《蘋果》遭受打壓，國際社會都會提供支持，從而向政府施壓，「可能言論上會有譴責，或者採取一啲行動去制裁啦。」群組訊息亦顯示，黎曾表示英文版只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞，做具有深度的報導，「貴精不貴多」；黎又指不需要向外國讀者呈現香港不同政治陣營的觀點，只需要集中在「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」、「黃營的普遍觀點」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方馮睎乾專欄提蘋果要做國際文宣線以增值&quot;&gt;控方：馮睎乾專欄提《蘋果》要做「國際文宣線」以「增值」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第八天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英於2020年5月10日設立群組「English news」，而陳沛敏是群組成員之一。陳確認，並指創立群組之前，黎曾經口頭上講過考慮推行英文新聞，但是沒有詳細說明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示群組訊息，黎稱：「今日馮睎乾提議出英譯新聞電子版諗得過，反正現在翻譯網站翻譯成本低而快。」控方問陳對馮睎乾文章內容有否印象，陳指大概記得馮在專欄文章中指英文新聞只有《南華早報》，而《蘋果日報》都可以做到英文新聞，以「打破當時得一間英文報紙嘅壟斷」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示馮睎乾於2020年5月10日的專欄文章《不撐蘋果的100萬人》，當中一段提到：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「蘋果救亡似乎只有兩個方向：一是增加訂閱量，吸納那100萬個潛在客戶，二是提供收費較高的訂閱選項，讓某些（不是一刀切加價）現有客戶多付點錢。但無論哪個方向，前提都是蘋果必須『增值』。根據我的網上觀察，以及讀者要求我反映的意見，『增值』主要有兩大方面：一是八卦式公義，二是國際文宣線。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏確認蘋果英文版方向是國際文宣線-黎智英冀美國政治人物訂閱&quot;&gt;陳沛敏確認《蘋果》英文版方向是「國際文宣線」 黎智英冀美國政治人物訂閱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，「國際文宣線」是否就是《蘋果》英文新聞的目標？陳回答：「係呢個方向，啫係為咗吸引國際關注香港發生咩事」，在她記憶中，黎曾提及這樣會為《蘋果》起到保護作用，若果國際社會有《蘋果》英文版的讀者，當《蘋果》遭受打壓，國際社會都會提供支持。被問到《蘋果》英文版有否特定國家對象，陳指「我諗譬如美國啦」，黎亦有提及過：「如果有美國政治人物訂閱，咁就好喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，高層一開始討論英文版做法時，她關心的是會否需要使用數頁實體報紙來刊登英文文章，但後來她理解黎似乎認為不需要印在報紙。以陳的理解，因為實體報紙只限於香港本地發行，平均每日約有6至7萬份，很難運送至外國發行，所以黎認為英文版不需要牽涉實體報紙，只需使用《蘋果》網站，可能是揀選一些中文文章來翻譯成英文，之後刊登在網站。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到，黎智英經常跟前社長張劍虹表達想揀選哪一類文章來翻譯，同事便會按照張的指示去揀選文章。被問到何以得知黎和張之間有就這方面溝通，陳指有時在群組看到相關訊息，張有時亦會轉達黎的說話，有時跟同事之間食飯，「吐苦水嘅時候又會講吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英冀英文版能做到打國際線效果&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英冀英文版能做到「打國際線」效果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示時任動新聞平台總監張志偉向群組發送的訊息：「老闆，張生，如是要外國讀者主動訂閱，我們英文版的 newsletter ，即我們要做有效的宣傳，reach 到這班讀者，故我們要想好怎宣傳這事。而我們最終目標是打國際線，我建議我們可考慮在美、英主流報章，如 New York Times、Washington Post、英國金融時報等實體報章和網站落廣告，宣傳我們將會做 newsletter 訂閱，令外國讀者知道這事，從而 subscribe 我們 newsletter ，就像連登仔在外國報章登廣告打國際線宣傳一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，「打國際線」是否設立英文版的「最終目標」？陳則指：「我理解黎生係想做到呢個效果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示時任《蘋果》總編輯羅偉光的訊息，他向群組提議，可邀請一些香港年輕人撰寫英文評論，例如曾捲入「世衞風波」的前香港電台記者 Yvonne Tong、身處美國的梁繼平，以及一些打「國際線戰線」的學生和「手足」，「讓這些香港年輕面孔面向世界，直接說香港情況。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏mark-simon較熟悉外國媒體-可協助宣傳英文版&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：Mark Simon較熟悉外國媒體 可協助宣傳英文版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英又在群組中提及：「我會叫 Mark 先搞好美國方面發放這消息的方法和渠道。」陳沛敏解釋，她估計黎的私人助理 Mark Simon 對外國媒體比較熟悉，因此他可以告訴外國媒體《蘋果》會籌辦英文版，以作宣傳。她表示，有時見到 Mark Simon 接受外國媒體採訪，「由佢去代表黎生回應一啲關於黎生或黎生業務嘅嘢」，所以印象中 Mark Simon 較熟悉外國媒體。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏在群組傳送訊息：「除了翻譯，可否請人直接寫關於香港問題的英文評論。」陳在庭上解釋，她當時認為，既然要出錢聘請人翻譯文章，為何不邀請一些作者以英文撰寫文章。再者，她認為她所負責的實體報紙，讀者對象應該是香港本地人士，但如果英文版的對象是外國讀者的話，黎智英和張劍虹可以考慮為外國讀者度身訂造（tailor-made）而去撰寫一些文章，所以她不認為實體報紙要遷就外國的讀者，包括國際社會、美國公眾和政界人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到，後來黎在群組內表示要做多一些中國新聞，因此有負責中國新聞的同事加入群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英曾向mark-simon-表示想彭斯訂閱蘋果英文版&quot;&gt;黎智英曾向Mark Simon 表示想彭斯訂閱《蘋果》英文版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英於2020年5月10日向Mark Simon傳送訊息：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Mark, Imaging if we can get Mike Pence to subscribe to Apple Daily app! The publicity and respect it command would arouse much support for us. I know it’s almost impossible to pull it off. But can try? Thanks Jimmy”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏解釋，黎認為若果時任美國副總統彭斯都是《蘋果》英文版的讀者的話，會令英文版的知名度提高，「咁喺美國社會都會有好多人支持，以我嘅理解。」若果政府打壓《蘋果》的話，國際社會都會支持《蘋果》，從而向政府施壓，「可能言論上會有譴責，或者採取一啲行動去制裁啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英訊息稱英文版只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞&quot;&gt;黎智英訊息稱英文版只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英在群組中稱，他們不需要報導所有新聞，只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞，做具有深度的報導：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t news (need) all news, only those big enough for foreigners to be interested. That may not be an everyday item. Yes, in depth good quality items. Again the motto is 貴精不貴多！”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，黎所指外國人感興趣的大新聞是什麼意思。陳則認為是一些關於香港社會運動的新聞，不過當時社會運動已經沉寂，她記得後來黎有講過要多報導中國新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/w0tANsG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英訊息稱尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版即是尋求他們的支持&quot;&gt;黎智英訊息稱尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版即是尋求他們的支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英其後繼續在群組發送訊息，指尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版即是尋求他們的支持：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“By enlisting foreign leaders to subscribe to us is enlisting their support. They of course understand it and that’s why they would do it. Now is a good time to appeal to them when the English version is launched.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳確認，尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版是其中一個目標，除了外國政治人物之外，黎也希望外國的公眾人士也能訂閱《蘋果》英文版。她理解若果外國政治人物訂閱，會是一種表態，以示支持《蘋果》和黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指不需平衡報導不同陣營觀點-只需報導泛黃觀點&quot;&gt;黎智英指不需平衡報導不同陣營觀點 只需報導泛黃觀點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在群組中表示，不需要向外國讀者呈現不同陣營的觀點，只需要集中在「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」、「黃營的普遍觀點」：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When we choose writers we don’t have to think about giving foreigners a balanced view of what happens here of every different colors, we only concentrate in our Apple Daily HK view, a general view of the yellow side. In choosing further writers we need not choose Weijian Shan, who’s a friend of mine and a very popular writer about China in the west. But his view is all China on the positive side we don’t need. We are not trying to strike a balance but the point of view of the people on the side of protecting HK. This is the voice the world wants to know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問何謂「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」，陳回答指，根據黎的演譯，就是「偏黃陣營的觀點」。控方續問，《蘋果》有否實行到黎所說的集中在「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」，陳表示：「我相信有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問《蘋果》是否實行到黎所說不需要平衡報導，陳表示：「似乎係囉。」控方追問，《蘋果》英文版報導中央政府新聞時，會採取什麼角度，陳則指：「會係對中國比較批判啲嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英想英文版報導中美關係中國與國際之間互動&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英想英文版報導中美關係、中國與國際之間互動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，後來前《蘋果》主筆馮偉光被選做英文版的總編輯，應該是由他按照黎智英的準則去揀選文章來翻譯成英文。相關準則包括著重有關中國的新聞，或者「一啲佢（黎）覺得外國讀者會關注，啫唔係咁香港本地嘅嘢囉」，至於文章角度，「我諗都係有批判性。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》主筆 馮偉光，筆名「盧峯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到有什麼「唔係咁香港本地」的新聞例子，陳舉例指當年《蘋果》大篇幅報導沙中線醜聞，雖然獲得獎項，但是這不是黎認為能夠吸引國際關注的新聞。她理解黎想英文版報導中美關係、中國與國際之間互動，以及牽引到國際社會要關心的議題，而且正如黎早前提及要報導「偏黃」觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏蘋果比較支持和諒解示威者的處境-因普選訴求符合黎智英取態&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：《蘋果》比較支持和諒解示威者的處境 因普選訴求符合黎智英取態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示前動新聞平台總監張志偉的訊息：「老闆，張生，我想有一方法去打國際線，出我們的蘋果英文版內容，就是利用現成的 patreon 平台，代替我們自己去 send 出 newsletter 」，張又指：「因我們今次打國際線，目的是發揮香港《蘋果日報》在外國的影響力和話語權，訂閱人頭和收入同樣重要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，《蘋果》只是一份報紙，為何會涉及「打國際線」？陳則認為張志偉僅使用了社運人士所使用的字眼，但她不能代張解讀原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問《蘋果》有否參與「打國際線」，若有的話，會是以什麼形式參與。陳表示：「我諗我唔會用『參與』」，不過當時《蘋果》的態度「會係比較支持和諒解示威者的處境，立場係比較支持佢哋嘅訴求」，例如有訴求提到普選，而這符合黎一向支持民主的取態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問為何《蘋果》比較支持示威者。陳指，除了上述提及示威者部份訴求符合黎的立場之外，在七一佔領立法會事件之後，黎想《蘋果》報導示威者心聲，「佢嗰時都直接講個動機係運動可以持續落去，我估係以咁嘅方式去支持？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，當示威者談及「國際線」時，意思是想國際人士關注香港情況，若果得到外國支持，運動會有較大成功機會，「如果佢哋（示威者）受到鎮壓，國際社會會出聲呀咁。」她理解這種「國際支持」，與黎開頭籌辦英文版時，提及想得到外國的支持和得到保護，「我理解個邏輯係一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英不贊成用patreon-並指美國政治人物訂閱對政治庇護更重要&quot;&gt;黎智英不贊成用Patreon 並指美國政治人物訂閱對政治庇護更重要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月12日的群組訊息，黎智英回應張志偉的 Patreon 提議，稱：「Patreon 的問題是與蘋果日報隔離，我們主要目的是外國人撐蘋果日報，尤其美國政治人物訂閱蘋果對我們的政治庇護更重要，我仍然認為英文版有需要設在我們 app 內。而設 app 內時間不用太久。等回來我處談談。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏確認記憶中《蘋果》最終沒有使用 Patreon 來發布英文版文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英提議翻譯桑普林本利和李兆富文章&quot;&gt;黎智英提議翻譯桑普、林本利和李兆富文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前社長張劍虹曾在群組中表示：「林本利我們可以翻譯他的社評」、「楊社長介紹 Steve Vines、Michael Chugani 和一個叫 Albert Wun 的美籍華人」，其後黎智英表示：「以上可加桑普、林本利和 Simon Lee。Mark Simon and Mark Clifford 也認識一些本地住寫英文的 KOL 給我們寫。每天平均有兩篇英文稿就差不多了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏表示記得 Steve Vines 曾在英文報紙工作過，亦有寫過一些評論文章；Michael Chugani （禇簡寧）亦有在英文報紙工作過，其後在電台擔任主持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及桑普文章的角度，陳指「都係對政府比較有批判性」。林本利則是經濟學家，比較多寫經濟分析。至於 Simon Lee 即是李兆富，陳形容他「好崇尚市場經濟，反對政府干預，覺得要由私人市場去做」，即是崇尚「大市場，小政府」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏憶述被捕後-同事擔心公司會否倒閉或更多人被捕&quot;&gt;陳沛敏憶述被捕後 同事擔心公司會否倒閉或更多人被捕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎訊息中提及的 Mark Clifford 是壹傳媒集團的非執行董事。陳確認，但她表示當時並未留意 Mark Clifford。她憶述，當年一些董事被警方拘捕之後，會計部很徬徨，如果他們不獲准保釋，便未能簽署支票出稿費，後來公司找黎智英和張劍虹委任她自己和羅偉光，「到時有咩事都可以簽支票」，但陳被委任之後，記憶中董事局便沒有再開過會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，她不是因為獲委任為董事而知道 Mark Clifford 這個人，而是因為在報紙上看到宣傳黎智英 Live Chat 節目的全版廣告，當中顯示 Mark Clifford 會出席節目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳略顯激動地提到，最深印象是她在2021年6月17日被捕之後，獲得警方擔保出來時，因為公司財產被凍結，同事都擔心公司會否倒閉，若果倒閉會否賠償到欠薪和遣散費，或者擔心會否再有其他同事被捕。而她當時已向公司辭職，「我係咪可以代表同事問董事局，《蘋果日報》係咪應該結束呢？」陳表示：「我嘅意見係要結束啦」，因為當有同事問她「我哋繼續做落去，會唔會畀人拉？當同事咁問我，我做唔到呢個擔保」，因要詢問董事局。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官此時打斷，指這是後來發生的事件，希望按目前時序來作供，待稍後談到2021年6月時才詳細交代。陳回應，她交代上述事件，目的是想講「去到2021年嗰個位，我先知道 Mark Clifford。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏馮偉光曾做英語媒體-是主理英文版適合人選&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：馮偉光曾做英語媒體 是主理英文版適合人選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示群組訊息，黎智英表示：「我想 English news 我們需要一個人主理，例如挖大陸任志強等先進人士寫的文章翻譯，或將『方方日記』的精髓每天翻譯一小段作為花絮等，不斷為英文版構思些做法令其姿態生動是必須的。劍虹、沛敏和偉光請你們商量選一個人出來主理。這人可以是外面的人，總之對大陸和本港熟悉和英文好，一般學識水平高便可。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏指，英文版最後由馮偉光主理，因他長期替《蘋果》撰寫社論，知道《蘋果》的風格，又有在英語媒體工作的經驗，所以是適合的人選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏憶述黎智英稱當蘋果英文版與南早不同便能引人訂閱&quot;&gt;陳沛敏憶述黎智英稱當《蘋果》英文版與《南早》不同便能引人訂閱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指訊息紀錄顯示，陳在2020年5月13日收到一條語音訊息，而她其後回覆「收到，已聽」。陳確認該語音訊息是一次會議的錄音，由於她沒有出席該次會議，所以同事事後傳送會議錄音給她。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上閱畢錄音謄本之後，控方問她會否記得黎想要哪一種中國新聞。陳指黎提到內地維權新聞，而香港新聞則想繼續關注警暴、自由民主等議題。她稱記得黎講過，「（當《蘋果》）變咗同《南華早報》好唔同嘅時候，啲人就會訂閱《蘋果日報》喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（8日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第26日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方在黎智英的手機中發現一張佩洛西的 Twitter 截圖，當中附有黎、李柱銘和佩洛西的合照；控方另在黎的手機發現一張照片，是美國審議《香港人權與民主法案》前夕，共和黨議員克魯茲（Ted Cruz）訪港期間，他與黎智英、前政務司司長陳方安生、前立法會資訊科技界議員莫乃光和前立法會法律界議員郭榮鏗的合照。另外，庭上談及2019年9月出版的特刊《2019年自由之夏》，陳沛敏指由於首次出版便沽清，《蘋果》其後加印第二版，以及推出英文版，而且扣除收入所得收益會捐給612人道支援基金。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英赴美會見議員後-個人專欄解答問題-蘋果亦有報導&quot;&gt;黎智英赴美會見議員後 個人專欄解答問題 《蘋果》亦有報導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第五天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;昨天審訊提到黎智英於2019年10月赴美國會見參議員之後，要求陳沛敏構思約10條問題問他，以供他解答作為專欄題目。陳供稱她當時與同事構思了一些問題，包括「由最基本問起，例如點解要去」，「佢（黎）應該寫完之後，就 pass 畀 Ophe（同事）」，陳相信文章最終有刊登。她另確認，事後並沒有派記者去訪問黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英專欄文章〈美國人想對我們說的話〉，刊於2019年10月27日副刊E3版。黎在文章開首說：「這幾天身在美國，難以抽身撰寫專欄，公司手足反問我是否可解答一些疑問，造就以下答問。」陳確認文章中的問題與她交給黎的問題相似。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，文章共有九條問答，其中一條問題是「示威暴力升級，美國政界對香港抗爭看法有轉變嗎？」，問陳當時為何想到此問題。陳指因為當時有些美國議員關注示威暴力。控方續問為何會認為黎有能力回答此問題，陳表示：「因為佢一路都係對呢啲問題有睇法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一條問題是：「《香港人權與民主法案》通過後是否真的可以制裁黑警、葉劉、何君堯？」控方問陳為何有此問題。陳則指因為當時美國正在醞釀《香港人權與民主法案》，而「黑警、葉劉、何君堯」是示威者及其支持者曾提及過的制裁對象，但美國支持示威者的輿論會問：「係咪呢啲人都要負上責任呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了黎的專欄文章之外，陳記得《蘋果》亦有報導黎的訪美之行。控方遂展示2019年10月23日《蘋果》實體報紙報導〈黎智英冀美議員向港府施壓〉，當中載有時任美國眾議院議長佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）與黎智英和民主黨元老李柱銘的合照。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;美國審議香港人權與民主法案前夕-共和黨議員訪港-黎智英陳方安生等人會面&quot;&gt;美國審議《香港人權與民主法案》前夕 共和黨議員訪港 黎智英陳方安生等人會面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示一張在黎手機檢取的圖片，乃2019年10月23日由 Mark Simon 傳送給黎，為佩洛西的 Twitter 截圖，顯示佩洛西與黎和李的合照。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So pleased to welcome Jimmy Lai, Martin Lee and Janet Pang to the U.S. Capitol.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示一張由前公民黨立法會法律界議員郭榮鏗於10月13日傳送給黎的相片，相中人包括黎智英、美國共和黨參議員克魯茲（Ted Cruz）、前政務司司長陳方安生、前立法會資訊科技界議員莫乃光和郭榮鏗，地點為香港會所（The Hong Kong Club）。法庭傳譯員翻譯「Dennis Kwok」時，一度錯誤譯為郭家麒，控方聽罷指正。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，《蘋果日報》於2019年10月13日報導克魯茲訪港，題為〈美議員轟林鄭撤會面軟弱〉，報紙頁面上方寫有「訪港力撐」，文章提及上述5人會面，當時為美國審議《香港人權與民主法案》前夕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月28日，《蘋果》手機程式發出一則推播通知（push notification），報導題為〈【人權法】特朗普動筆簽署 《香港人權民主法》生效〉。控方問這是否一宗「大新聞」，所以要發出推播通知。陳同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏應黎智英要求處理羅傑斯給示威者的公開信&quot;&gt;陳沛敏應黎智英要求處理羅傑斯給示威者的公開信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月18日，黎智英把「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）的公開信「AN OPEN LETTER TO DETAINEES AND PROTESTORS IN HONG KONG」傳送給陳沛敏，問她能否刊登或報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，她當時應該有將相關公開信交給網上新聞的同事處理，不過後來《蘋果》沒有全文刊登，而是將它夾雜在其他新聞之中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指該段時間香港有很多人被捕，羅傑斯希望就此作出回應，而「佢嘅訊息符合我哋一路以嚟嘅報導」，因此把公開信轉交給同事跟進。控方問這是否與黎有關，陳指有關，「咁黎生叫我刊登，我咪問同事趕唔趕得切刊登。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月27日，黎智英的專欄「成敗樂一笑」刊出文章〈我們堅持下去，才有希望〉。控方特別指出其中數句：「我們逆權運動雖然傷亡慘重，我們卻阻擋了送中惡法，團結香港人萬眾一心保護家園的決心，獲得了以美國為首的自由世界國家和人民的支持，美國政府通過《香港人權與民主法案》，和最近壓倒性的區議會選舉勝利，只要我們堅持不灰心，最後贏回《基本法》賦予我們普選的權利，絕對有可能。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2020年1月蘋果送逆權月曆&quot;&gt;2020年1月《蘋果》送「逆權月曆」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年1月1日的《蘋果》頭版，標題為：〈踏入2020市民高呼 光復香港〉，右上方寫有「明日再送 逆權月曆」。陳稱《蘋果》以往從未附送日曆，該次是首次。控方特別指出新聞圖片中有人展示「光復香港 時代革命」旗幟。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年1月2日的《蘋果》則以〈103萬人遊行 入夜警狂拉400人 香港人，戰鬥！〉作為標題。控方問陳，誰人會戰鬥？且他們為了什麼而戰鬥？陳回答：「呢個係示威遊行有人嗌嘅口號」，為了爭取他們提及的「五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年1月13日，陳沛敏向主筆楊清奇傳送「飯盒會」會議紀錄截圖，當中提及「週末評論版可嘗試找端、立場、眾的一些寫得好的作者撰稿」，陳並問楊：「清奇，可否請你或 Jason 整理一下近月加入的作者陣容告訴我？因後天我們有飯盒會。」陳庭上解釋，因她當時不太掌握報紙論壇版有哪些作者，想與上述網媒作者陣容作比較，以看看兩者是否有分別。而 Jason 是楊的同事，當楊休假時會代為打理報紙論壇版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果出版特刊2019年自由之夏-陳沛敏稱當時賣斷市-張劍虹同意加印&quot;&gt;《蘋果》出版特刊《2019年自由之夏》 陳沛敏稱當時賣斷市 張劍虹同意加印&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指《蘋果》在2019年9月出版特刊《2019年自由之夏》，中文版於2019年9月20日出版，於9月27日再次出版，而英文版「FREEDOM SUMMER」則於同年10月9日出版。其中只有英文版和9月27日中文版的封面有標註價錢是10元，並聲稱扣除成本之後，淨收入會捐給「612人道支援基金」，至於9月20日的中文版則沒有標註價錢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，當時刊物出版後，有好多人買，「應該賣晒，斷咗市」，讀者要求《蘋果》加印，高層得悉讀者聲音之後，在社長張劍虹的同意下加印。控方追問，陳提及的高層是否包括黎智英？陳表示不肯定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中一頁寫「11.24 血債票償」，陳確認是關於區議會選舉。刊物內附有「抗爭日程大事記」，列出6月9日至9月16日之間的事件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏對沙田新城市衝突相片印象深刻&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：對沙田新城市衝突相片印象深刻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及其中一張新聞圖片，拍攝到7月14日沙田新城市廣場警民衝突情況，當天發生暴動及有警員被咬傷手指。陳指這照片並非由《蘋果》記者拍攝，而是從相片源頭購買或者借用。她表示對相片印象深刻，「因為呢張相對於我嚟講，係幾出色嘅作品，唔係好大路咁影示威者同警察爭執」，而是拍攝到黑衣人士之間有一名紅衣女子拿著購物袋。控方問她有否要求同事將相片納入特刊，陳僅表示：「記憶中我有（向同事）提過我覺得呢張相影得好好。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAWS are not a single capability. Hence, this paper considers the risks associated with LAWS based on the likelihood and impact of their proliferation in relation to three broad categories: minimum viable product (MVP); military off the shelf (MOTS); and boutique. The sophistication of these systems differs significantly, as do the risks each pose and the demands they place on users, all of which has an impact on the proliferation risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MVP LAWS involve homemade and commercially specified and available technologies. The software, hardware and expertise necessary to develop a minimally functioning LAWS are widely available and within the reach of non-state actors if they see benefit in its adoption. These weapons represent the biggest risk of proliferation, especially in relation to non-state actors, but they are often fragile and, considered individually, are not game-changing (in terms of impact) for modern militaries. However, even relatively simple systems used at scale can still cause problems for Western militaries, who often lack mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOTS have high degrees of autonomy and are proliferating rapidly to anyone with sufficient funds, including non-state actors. However, while many are offensive capabilities, they also include defensive systems, such as air defence weapons that are often autonomous but not offensive. The risk posed by MOTS LAWS is arguably limited by affordability, but there may be clear advantages to adoption, including enabling battlefield mass. MOTS proliferation is highly likely, and military advances in autonomy are more a matter of will and ethics than of technological hurdles. So, while the likelihood of proliferation is high (if slightly lower than for MVPs), the impact is higher, especially if the systems can be used at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boutique LAWS are exquisite capabilities being developed by a select few countries. They are very expensive complex systems designed for specific effects against well-identified threats, such as a specific element of an opponent’s strategic defensive network or deterrence capabilities, and as such are the most destabilising (high impact). Their adoption advantage is high, but the cost of developing and maintaining them means proliferation is currently unlikely beyond the wealthiest states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adoption advantage is needed for LAWS to proliferate and, in many areas, such as the MVP and MOTS paradigms, advanced conventional capabilities still have an edge over LAWs, although this may change. As the technology underpinning LAWS matures and becomes proven, proliferation risks will increase. Militaries have the opportunity, and arguably the responsibility, to lead the conversation about proliferation and shape its outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 14 September 2019, 25 drones and missiles in two waves damaged the Abqaiq and Khurais oil-processing facilities in Saudi Arabia, evading the advanced air defence systems guarding them. This was not the first attack on the Abqaiq facility. In 2006, Al-Qa’ida had used humans and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED), but the assailants were discovered by guards and killed, and the facility was not damaged. The two attacks, 13 years apart, highlight the pace at which technology has evolved, and how easily it can be wielded against states that previously enjoyed technological supremacy. The 2019 attacks were reportedly facilitated, and possibly launched, by Iranian forces using weapons developed for asymmetrically challenging regional opponents. Nonetheless, capabilities that were previously the preserve of nation states have proliferated to non-state actors, allowing them to attack cargo ships, airports and armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-state actors have demonstrated a willingness to adopt new and unproven technologies to create asymmetric advantage against more powerful opponents. In 2016, Islamic State (IS) forces in Mosul used UAVs to coordinate attacks against Iraqi forces using VBIEDs and mortars. Small states also appear willing to employ relatively untested technologies, such as loitering munitions and armed UAVs, to achieve their military goals. For example, in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Azeri forces deployed loitering munitions and UAVs to prepare for conventional combined arms assaults. Forces unable to access more sophisticated capabilities offered by Western militaries may look to increase the level of autonomy of their weapons to offset the extensive targeting and strike capabilities facing them. This poses risks that need to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper considers the risks of proliferation of lethal autonomous weapons (LAWS) for military organisations. Smaller, less powerful states, and non-state actors, represent a high proliferation risk via a minimum viable product (MVP) paradigm using LAWS that are rudimentary, but whose impact is medium. Military off-the-shelf (MOTS) products – ready-made weapons systems with varying degrees of autonomy – also present a proliferation risk and greater impact challenges, as they are more capable. Exquisite, or boutique, LAWS capabilities – such as the US Air Force’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft – have a lower likelihood of proliferation because of the cost, very high impact risk they carry, and the sophistication of the systems and organisations needed to operate them effectively. Consequently, boutique LAWs are only briefly covered here, but they are extensively addressed elsewhere, for example in Paul Scharre’s Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper, aimed primarily at practitioners and policymakers rather than academic audiences, assesses the likely risks to Western military organisations posed by the proliferation of different types of LAWS. It relies on a review of secondary sources supplemented by interviews with leading experts. A literature review was conducted between August 2022 and April 2023 to assess the technological, regulatory and military drivers affecting the proliferation of LAWS. The review engaged widely with policy documents from NATO, the UK government and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), research documents from industry and civil society organisations, and national and international legal frameworks regulating LAWS use and development. Non-traditional sources were used (for example, blogs, YouTube) to investigate non-state developments, such as those created by lone actors. The literature review was supported by interviews with three leading experts to frame the challenges and enable further research through specialised defence media publications and academic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is comprised of five chapters. Chapter I establishes a definition of LAWS and outlines the current regulatory frameworks. Chapter II introduces MVP LAWS, and Chapter III covers some existing MOTS LAWS. Chapters IV and V examine currently available boutique LAWS and consider constraints on proliferation arising from within user organisations and thus the overall proliferation risk. The conclusion reiterates the risks facing Western militaries from LAWS and urges them to engage in shaping the environment through policy debates and in developing counter-LAWS capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-understanding-laws&quot;&gt;I. Understanding LAWS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of autonomy, especially involving LAWS, is complex and contested. Even obtaining clarity on a definition is challenging, because LAWS are systems comprising many elements, rather than a specific capability that can be neatly bounded. This paper adopts the ICRC “position” on LAWS, in which LAWS are systems built and programmed using software to “select and apply force to targets without human intervention” once deployed. These systems may or may not employ AI-enabled software to complete their mission or determine the best course of action. This definition is admittedly minimal, because it does not necessitate a capacity for automated target discrimination. However, as this paper specifically explores proliferation risks, the definition is sufficient for considering current systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many types of lethal weapons in service that employ some form of autonomy, and that number is growing. Such systems incorporate aspects of autonomy that include navigation, targeting, lethal weapons release or a combination of these, but in policy terms, many Western militaries seek to apply “meaningful human control” to decisions to release weapons; that is, they commit to maintaining a human in the kill chain who must approve the use of the lethal weapon. It is currently less common that LAWS are able or permitted to select their own targets based on neural networks, for example. Systems such as the Israeli Harpy loitering munition that attacks radar systems matching its target catalogue, or the Russian Lancet system, which is widely used in Ukraine and reputedly has similar characteristics or functions, although this is uncertain, rely on software that is hard-coded. So, even though the program that enables this is a form of AI that conducts operations that would typically require a human brain, it does so based on software that is predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following section considers the military interest in LAWS and some of the challenges of adoption, and then considers the policy framework within which the debate about LAWS is conducted, with a brief examination of the twin-track approach to a mix of prohibition and control currently being adopted by parts of the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-interest-in-laws&quot;&gt;Military Interest in LAWS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomy plays a part in many systems that ultimately deliver lethal effect, covering the data gathering to improve the accuracy and speed of targeting, through to the weapons, such as missiles or “smart” mines, that are then deployed to destroy or kill targets. Inevitably, there are risks with this, such as error in target selection, but autonomy and remotely operated systems offer militaries (and non-state actors) benefits in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness of lethality. They potentially allow for increases in battlefield mass and reduce costs – human and financial – by taking people out of the system and allowing one human to manage multiple effectors. This offers the prospect of increased mass and lethality from smaller forces, which might also help Western militaries respond to the societal, technological and political factors driving smaller armed forces. Autonomy might also reduce casualties for the side deploying such weapons by distancing them from the battlefield, even if it does not lower the total number of casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential benefits of LAWS, the mere existence of the technology is insufficient to drive proliferation, which is also impacted by factors such as organisational and technological system design and challenges of effective integration. The impetus for proliferation requires factors to combine and create value in adoption. This “adoption advantage” is unique to each entity. Militaries generally have a high adoption threshold because, to varying degrees, their conventional capabilities are extensive, and they have the structures and processes to support the use of these capabilities. However, funding and power structures play a part in proliferation. The influence of regional commanders, instead of there being an overarching strategy of adoption, allegedly led to haphazard procurement of armed drones in the Saudi Arabian military. Similar stovepipes exist within other militaries, and could both lead to the rapid introduction of LAWS and hamper its effective integration into wider force design. For example, Iraq’s LAWS procurement is believed to be shaped by individuals affiliated with Iran who are also trying to reduce reliance on Western arms, for whom the adoption advantage may be less about the capabilities than about the geopolitics. But institutional barriers can raise the level required for adoption advantage in military bureaucracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-state actors may have lower thresholds for adoption, especially if subjected to survival pressures by larger, well-equipped conventional militaries. State and non-state militaries are shaped very rapidly during conflict. The constant pressure of combat (losses, successes and failures) drives adaptation from the top of an organisation to the bottom, as well as from the bottom up. However, in non-state organisations, an absence of the procedures and structures typically found in militaries drives a different kind of innovation that may shape the proliferation of LAWS. Even large, seemingly homogeneous, organisations such as IS – which at one point claimed to have 31,500 fighters – comprise many smaller organisations technically working together, but often pursuing their own aims according to the local context. Thus, proliferation may be haphazard, and result in the technology’s opportunities being less well exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption advantage of LAWS is not absolute. Swarms of drones may be more lethal than a single drone but may not be more effective than an artillery barrage or precision strike by long-range missiles, both of which already exist in military inventories and are integrated into doctrine and tactics. Furthermore, humans still have an edge in some areas; LAWS will struggle to replace humans in counterinsurgency roles, or verify aircraft entering a country’s airspace. So, humans are likely to be better, albeit slower, combatants than LAWS in some circumstances, and current LAWS are typically better at augmenting capabilities within narrow confines, freeing humans to do other things. Nonetheless, the fact that autonomous weapons can be produced using dual-use technology, and their prevalence on the international market (both legitimate and black markets), suggests that autonomous weapons will be used by more states in the next decade. Furthermore, the war in Ukraine could accelerate this proliferation, whereby sophisticated technologies are captured and made available for reverse engineering by states or criminal actors with fewer controls on autonomous modes, their use or sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In peacetime, the drivers and character of military innovation and adaptation are less settled. Theo Farrell argues that militaries are bound by rationality and routine – more prone to exploiting existing structures, processes and technologies than to exploring new ones. Peacetime innovation within armed forces is, therefore, difficult, often driven by perceived changes in a state’s environment, as well as hypotheses about the changing technological landscape. This is likely to impact on the large-scale adoption of LAWS in many militaries. A rare example of radical peacetime innovation is the US Marine Corps’ (USMC) “Force Design 2030”, which moves the Corps from heavy land warfare capabilities to a lighter, multi-role littoral force supporting the US Navy. Under this programme, the USMC divested itself of $16 billion of proven (non-autonomous) platforms, such as the M1 Abrams main battle tank, to invest in new technologies, for example, long-range anti-ship missiles, and adopted new doctrine and concepts of operations to deter and compete with China. The move represents considerable organisational risk to the USMC, and may compromise its ability to fight conventional land wars, but has been justified against the potential risks to US security, especially in the Indo-Pacific. However, experience suggests that peacetime innovation that requires significant change in doctrine, tactics or technological capabilities will likely be radical and require enterprise-wide reform and, as such, is often resisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-framework&quot;&gt;Policy Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the tactical and operational arguments for the adoption of LAWS, there are concerns about proliferation, and the debate around the potential impact of LAWS has reached the UN. The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) seeks to “ban or restrict the use of specific types of weapons that are considered to cause unnecessary or unjustifiable suffering to combatants or to affect civilians indiscriminately” and has been ratified by 126 states. However, decisions are made by consensus, achieved through “the absence of objection rather than a particular majority”, giving individual states the power to veto proposals made. In 2016, a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on LAWS was formed to convene military, legal, technological and diplomatic experts from the state parties, international institutions, NGOs, academia and other parts of civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCW framework has three themes around autonomous weapons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The necessity for international regulation governing the development of LAWS: 90 of the 126 states currently support a legally binding instrument with both prohibition and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How human–machine interaction will and will not inform the use of LAWS, and where human control should be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How autonomous systems are defined and interpreted, their role within society and their use in warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GGE has also adopted 11 guiding principles for responsible state behaviour around LAWS, although attempts to regulate LAWS have been hindered by the inability to agree a definition of them. Consequently, consensus-based decision-making in the near future is challenging, “if not impossible”. Individual countries can determine their own parameters for LAWS use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government, in an annex on LAWS in its Defence Artificial Intelligence Strategy, argued for “context-appropriate human involvement”. What “appropriate” meant was not specified, so while the Strategy is positive in terms of Britain’s potential to lead development of an international status quo for LAWS, the lack of clarity is similar to concerns expressed about ambiguity in other policy positions on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, in the largest cross-regional statement in any UN discussions on the topic, 70 states in the UN General Assembly issued a joint statement on LAWS. The statement acknowledged serious humanitarian, legal, security, technological and ethical concerns surrounding the use of LAWS, and the need to assure structures for human accountability regarding the use of force. There was a particular emphasis on the need for internationally agreed rules, with a combination of prohibitions and regulations to limit the uses of LAWS seen as more realistic than a blanket restriction, given the lack of a clear definition of the systems under discussion. Reflecting this, a joint call to develop, by 2026, a legally binding instrument setting clear prohibitions and restrictions on autonomous weapons was made by the UN secretary-general and the president of the ICRC in October 2023. This was followed by the General Assembly approving a resolution on regulating autonomous systems, which was supported by 164 states, including several major military powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulation-to-control-proliferation&quot;&gt;Regulation to Control Proliferation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An outright ban on LAWS remains unlikely, given the definitional challenges, scope for dual-use technologies, breadth of LAWS applications and the potential strategic advantages for armed forces. However, regulating specific uses or consequences of using LAWS and building on existing law is plausible, and may be desirable, given the potential of LAWS to create instability. Militaries are potentially well placed to lead this, because they own their targeting cycles and can dictate what is and is not acceptable or responsible as a part of them. They could, therefore, use their influence through requirement setting to shape the international debate on LAWS regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procurement and use of autonomous systems are always subject to human decision-making; a human decided to buy and deploy the weapon. Such decisions are typically made at strategic or operational command levels in Western armed forces with legal advice, although not all users will take the same approach. Commanders will, broadly, understand the parameters of LAWS within the context of international humanitarian law, which will inform their use. Although commanders may not understand the details and complexities of specific algorithms, their position within the military organisation guarantees a level of accountability under existing legal frameworks designed to prevent negative effects for civilians and personnel. Militaries can regulate the use of LAWS further through the training of decision-making in ways that minimise unpredictability in their use and maintenance. Even where knowledge gaps exist within a military, someone can be held directly responsible for their use. This remains true regardless of the level of autonomy or the unpredictability of any given LAWS. However, clear chains of accountability do not completely eliminate the risk of unpredictability in technology or humans, nor the risks presented by independent systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Independence” raises important questions of specificity. LAWS will do what they have been programmed to do. Simple systems may be able to launch a strike in response to a specific stimulus – for example, a suspicious aircraft moving at high velocity within national territory. More complex systems may be programmed to self-teach using ever-expanding datasets, and have greater freedom to decide for themselves how to respond to less predefined situations. Either system could operate with or without human oversight, and both could deliver lethal or non-lethal operational advantage. The spectrum of possibilities, uses and effects associated with LAWS is already broad enough to limit the ability to prohibit LAWS, and this breadth must inform attempts to regulate their use. The specific uses of LAWS and consequences of their use will, therefore, drive attempts at regulation. This specificity will also help to mitigate the complexities of debates over the role of the human, assuming there is human interaction beyond initial deployment, and could help improve the definition of LAWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the armed forces can satisfy themselves that they have taken adequate steps to consider any potential effects on civilians and have determined the outcome as necessary to achieve a strategic aim, the use of LAWS may not fall beyond the boundaries of international humanitarian law or the Geneva Conventions – regardless of the level of human interaction. These factors mean that attempts at regulation are more likely to succeed by focusing on specific outcomes rather than on the role of the human, although this remains a difficult area to navigate, and friction remains over when and how regulation should apply. In the GGE in 2023, the UK, Ireland, Norway and Switzerland, among others, promoted examination of common characteristics and effects, with flexibility to reflect the rapid pace of technological change. The US differed, proposing a focus on the objective nature of the weapons system rather than its use, but fell short of calling for international law. India, Israel and Russia explicitly stated they would not agree to a legal instrument. This block to progress is unlikely to be lifted soon, but the shift towards regulating LAWS in specific contexts could provide space to explore how existing international humanitarian law applies to specific scenarios where different types of LAWS might be used, to test the suitability of existing legislation. Such an approach could constrain the proliferation of LAWS – albeit within narrower confines than originally hoped for by many of the parties to the CCW – and is perhaps realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-minimum-viable-product-laws&quot;&gt;II. Minimum Viable Product LAWS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debate around LAWS is implicitly split between the exquisite capabilities under development by the US, China and other major powers, and less advanced systems that have been, or might be, developed by non-state actors, defence manufacturers or militaries with limited budgets. LAWS manufactured by responsible defence companies are typically designed to comply with the laws of armed conflict and are subject to rigorous testing before entering service – although this itself is technically demanding. This is less true of MVP LAWS that use non-military grade components – where the technical, intellectual and financial bar for entry is low – including commercial off-the-shelf and dual-use technology, open source software and even detailed instructions for how to build non-lethal capabilities, such as autonomous sentry paintball guns, or hobby drones adapted for more dangerous uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;individual-mvp-use&quot;&gt;Individual MVP Use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of expertise for MVP LAWS need not be that high. Image-recognition-based targeting capabilities can legitimately be developed for commercial purposes by individuals using open source software and commercial components. For example, individuals have created “smart cat flaps” for their homes using image recognition software that detects when cats are carrying prey and keeps the cat flap locked. One used YOLO, an object recognition algorithm that classifies objects using training images, while another learned to code specifically for the purpose, indicating that no prior expertise is needed. It follows that suitably motivated combatants could adopt this dual-use image recognition technology for LAWS, for example using open source, pre-trained neural networks against an occupying force’s vehicles and personnel. For example, given the length of NATO’s deployment to Afghanistan, or the ongoing conflicts in Libya, Syria and Ukraine, which involve consistent terrain, vehicle types and uniforms, such forces would be vulnerable to relatively simple MVP LAWS. IS in Mosul, for example, would only need a program capable of recognising the M1A1 Abrams and T-72 tanks sold to Iraq – a relatively straightforward task when they were the only tanks in the city. Consequently, narrowly defined operational scenarios in which Western forces often find themselves could allow adversaries to deploy MVP LAWS against them using readily available autonomous target recognition and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cat flaps mentioned above were developed using software already available from experts. This differentiates the risks of LAWS proliferation from other proliferation risks: nuclear scientists capable of building and developing a nuclear weapon are rarer than computer programmers, and the engineering challenge is significantly greater for nuclear capabilities. Already happening in Ukraine, it is reasonable to presume that in future conflicts there is scope for programmers to become involved and develop autonomous weapons or technologies based on experience gained in the commercial sector. This vector has precedent. In 1995, Japanese cult terrorist group Aum Shinrikyo released a sarin gas nerve agent on the Tokyo subway, killing 12 people and injuring 5,000 more. One member of the group, Masami Tsuchiya, held a Master’s degree in chemistry and developed a working sarin gas from library books and his university education. Increasing production of the gas led to a reduction in the product’s purity, but it was nonetheless capable of causing extensive harm when released. Aum Shinrikyo also funded and ran a biological weapons programme, which was less effective than its chemical weapons programme, but the group’s success in developing these weapons, while limited, demonstrates what can happen when those with the right knowledge turn their hand to nefarious activity. There are clear parallels with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MVP LAWS, including commercially available civilian autonomous platforms, are accessible by individuals, non-state actors and states facing larger, more powerful armed forces. They are, however, fragile, and are likely to be the resort of weaker powers against stronger ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;armed-forces-mvp-use&quot;&gt;Armed Forces’ MVP Use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, Ukraine has employed hobby drones against Russian forces in Donbas. The country’s armed forces were not prepared for the war and had been described as “an army literally in ruins”. Innovation occurred organically from the bottom up, with one unit converting a Saxon armoured vehicle into a drone control centre for conducting strikes on Russian positions. Over time, Ukrainian society responded to the threat, leading to innovations in software, for example, GIS Arta, which uses GPS and digital mapping to track the positions of Ukrainian artillery systems. When a target is detected, it is logged, almost in real time, and the system’s algorithms decide which artillery system is best placed to conduct an engagement. The human gun crew may not see or visually confirm the target. The GIS Arta’s autonomy appears to be limited to selecting the most suitable weapon, but it is relevant to debates about proliferation because it was developed by Ukrainian civilians and taken up by the armed forces without defence industry involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on this, the company Saker developed an image recognition program to identify Russian armoured vehicles, including, according to the programmers, camouflaged vehicles. Saker claims its drones can self-correct after dropping a bomb to ensure that the next bomb is accurate. The program works, in part, because its operational scenario is narrow and the categories of potential targets are easily defined. It needs to identify Russian combat vehicles, a large but ultimately finite target set, aided by Ukraine operating many of the same platforms. It does not need to determine whether an identified tank is a T-72 or T-64, simply that it is a tank. As an operator directs the drone’s flight, the question of whether it is a Russian or Ukrainian tank is irrelevant. In limited deployment scenarios, therefore, MVP AI-assisted programs can identify and engage targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some states – Iran in particular – have demonstrated a patient approach to the indigenous development of autonomous weapons, and are proactively proliferating them. However, the software and hardware are openly available and actors may be able to develop their own solutions if the will and need exist. In the case of non- or less-developed state actors, there may be an adoption advantage in embracing even relatively limited capabilities, so the MVP proliferation risk here is high. However, the essentially limited nature of MVP LAWS suggests that the impact of their use will generally be low in small-scale use. And non-state actors are unlikely to be able to procure, convert and prepare to use very large quantities of drones without creating a significant footprint. Non-state and state actors have used other technologies to attack on a small scale, including IEDs or human lone-wolf attacks, that have not had hugely destabilising effects. This does not, of course, preclude the impact on the public of the use of an MVP LAWS for a targeted assassination of a kind akin to Archduke Ferdinand’s assassination in June 1914, or an attack such as 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-military-off-the-shelf-laws&quot;&gt;III. Military Off-the-Shelf LAWS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where MVP LAWS are likely to be used by non-state actors and weaker militaries against stronger ones, they will be fragile and so standard militaries are more likely to prefer more capable MOTS LAWS. This proliferation avenue is, therefore, very likely, and probably will have greater impact. Dan Wasserbly argues that the development of such LAWS is more about will and ethical concerns than about the technology itself. This chapter focuses on what is an admittedly limited number of states with the ability to design and manufacture LAWS that could be exported to actual or potential opponents of Western militaries. Meaningful analysis of the proliferation risk presented by every nation and/or military is beyond the scope of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOTS LAWS that can claim some form of autonomy fall into two broad categories: single-use weapons destroyed in engaging a target; and multiple-use systems that carry armaments for target engagement. The majority of those discussed here are aerial vehicles. Although developing underwater or surface vessels is, theoretically, straightforward, autonomous ground vehicles represent a greater challenge. The MOTS proliferation risk is largely dependent on the nature of the country that has developed the technology. Some have a legacy of proliferating destabilising and harmful technologies, others less so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple states are pursuing independent LAWS programmes. Indonesia operates an autonomous coastal surveillance system procured from Israel and has domestic companies examining other autonomous technologies. South Korea’s Dodaam Systems received widespread condemnation in 2015 for its autonomous remote weapons station, while Hanwha has expressed the goal of automating its K9 self-propelled howitzer by 2040. The analysis in this chapter focuses on the potential for autonomous weapons to proliferate in ways that could bring Western militaries into contact with them. So, while the countries below have a record of providing sensitive technologies to others, they are likely not alone in proliferating MOTS LAWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china&quot;&gt;China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China represents a significant proliferation challenge. Beijing has assisted Pakistan in acquiring nuclear weapons, contributed to Iran’s nuclear programme, and is critical in financing North Korea’s regime. Publicly, China supports both prohibition and regulation of the use of LAWS, but this contradicts the private rhetoric of the People’s Liberation Army and the Chinese Communist Party. China’s expansive R&amp;amp;D budget and close links between its universities and defence industry mean dual-use technologies and new developments in autonomy may be easily absorbed into the development of LAWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s defence industry is one of the few to have developed and sold LAWS on the international market. In 2018 it was reported that Ziyan had sold its Blowfish A2 drone to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and by 2019 was in negotiations with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan for the same system. The Blowfish can form ad hoc swarms, and carries an AI-augmented targeting system allowing it to search for, identify and acquire targets, adjusting its aim and autonomously select the “trigger time” to engage the target. The level of human involvement is unclear, although the Blowfish is understood to include some form of ground control station that allows an operator to halt a mission if required. When swarming, the Blowfish relies on a module that “is capable of autonomously performing formations, attack functions, and collision avoidance”. The operator selects the attack profile, suggesting the operator might select a target, which the Blowfish swarm then decides how to attack. This form of autonomy is replicated in other Chinese designs, as well as the UAE’s Hunter 2S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the China Electric Power Research Institute revealed its UAV swarm system for reconnaissance, electronic warfare, “information countermeasures” and kinetic strikes – its name roughly translates as “Swarm No. 1 Marine Vehicle”. It uses an off-road truck chassis to carry 48 loitering munitions in a launch rack with space in the cabin for the crew. The level of human involvement is not clear, but it appears that humans select the target, and the swarm decides its approach and tactics for the engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iran&quot;&gt;Iran&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran arguably represents the greatest proliferation risk, having provided weapons and expertise to the Houthis in Yemen. Iran’s Quds Force, part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has led and supported proxy forces since its establishment in 1979. This assistance includes the provision of arms and training, including ballistic missiles and kamikaze drones, that have enabled the Houthis to attack targets in Saudi Arabia. In February 2023, the UK presented evidence to the UN that Iran supplied advanced weapons to the Houthis in violation of a UN Council Resolution. In 2022, Hizbullah’s leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, indicated that his group could turn their arsenal of unguided rockets into guided missiles with the help of Iran. In August 2022, an attack was conducted on the US base at Al-Tanf in Syria by an Iran-backed militia using KAS-04 drones supplied by Iran. Most recently, Iran has transferred a large quantity of UAVs and loitering munitions such as the Shahed-136 to Russia, which have contributed to Russia’s war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran intends to be an early adopter of LAWS, and has developed several drones reportedly capable of autonomously locating and engaging ground-based as well as airborne targets. Iran’s developments in LAWS technology may well follow the MVP paradigm, but at a state level. Iran’s willingness to distribute sensitive technologies to proxy forces and partners represents a significant proliferation risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;israel&quot;&gt;Israel&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a direct threat to Western armed forces, Israel presents a proliferation pathway as it has sold military systems to others who could use, transfer or re-engineer them. The Harpy is arguably the most successful LAWS by export sales – in service with Azerbaijan, China, India, Israel, South Korea and Turkey. In the 2000s, there were efforts to modify the Harpy so that it could autonomously locate and detect missile launchers before contacting the operator for strike authorisation. Subsequent developments from the Harpy’s manufacturer, IAI, have eschewed fully autonomous targeting – for example, the Harop requires human control at all times, but flies autonomously to the selected area. Similarly, Elbit, which manufactures the Lanius, a racing quadcopter design, has been explicit that “attack missions require man-in-the-loop control to approve fire procedures”. However, while this would not be easy, there is a risk that human-in-the-loop functions could be overridden by malicious actors with the requisite skills, or replicas made without this safety check – although replicas are likely to be more basic and potentially more easily countered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel is also a leader in autonomous ground vehicles. The Carmel programme, launched in 2019, allows the crew to monitor the vehicle’s autonomous actions and interfere if necessary. The solution, based around IAI’s Athena software, can be installed on any platform and is designed to autonomously detect and categorise threats, navigate with or without pre-planned routes, and make decisions about whether or not to alert the operators to any detected threats. So, although not a weapon system, the technology could be combined with other elements to create a LAWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s attitudes to LAWS could be shaped by many factors, but a significant factor in Israel’s foreign relations is its reliance on the US, which in the past has exerted political pressure on Israel to cancel arms deals and research links with China, for example. Where Israeli exports of LAWS run counter to US interests, there will likely be political pressure to prevent those sales from occurring. The proliferation risk presented by Israel is, therefore, mixed. The country is arguably the most capable of completing the development of LAWS and selling them to other users, but its delicate relations with the US will likely limit the potential spread of these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian Lancet loitering munition allegedly has autonomous capabilities and has been deployed operationally in Ukraine and Syria. The level of automation is not clear. The manufacturer, Kalashnikov, claims it is “capable of autonomously finding and hitting a target”, but there is no firm evidence of its ability to conduct completely autonomous engagements. However, a captured Lancet was found to carry a Nvidia TX2 single-board computer, which is designed for the edge processing of video data. This suggests that the Lancet may be capable of AI-supported targeting and video tracking. The same technology may also be used for autonomous navigation through the use of terrain features. The Lancet has been used more than 900 times in Ukraine, but video footage frequently released from it indicates that it is manually guided onto a target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Russian manufacturers and thinkers have expressed the view that proliferation of autonomous platforms is inevitable, and that Russia will have to create its own technologies to remain competitive. The war in Ukraine will likely impact Russia’s perceptions in this area, although it is not clear how. Further development will be hindered by Western sanctions, as many of Russia’s most advanced weapons rely on Western-supplied microelectronics. While sanctions will not completely deny access to the chips required for Russian LAWS, this and the loss of Russian expertise will also limit their development and subsequent proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turkey&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kargu is a loitering munition that gained notoriety in 2021 after a UN report into arms embargo violations in Libya claimed it had been used to autonomously engage fleeing targets. The specifics of this claim have been disputed, and it is not clear how much autonomy the system is actually designed to employ. Less is said about STM’s Alpagu, which is described as an autonomous tactical attack UAV. A promotional video from 2017 claims that it has sophisticated computer vision and deep learning algorithms, however it also appears to show a human operator. This suggests that while parts of the targeting cycle are automated and augmented with AI, the weapon itself may not be fully autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Turkey’s arms industry has a broad swathe of advanced capabilities, from high-energy lasers to electronic warfare and armed drones. It is increasingly exporting its capabilities, particularly autonomous capabilities. While a NATO ally, Turkey has been willing to ignore arms embargoes where it considers its strategic interests are at stake. Consequently, Turkey represents a proliferation risk because the proxy forces it has supported may not use the technology responsibly. Nonetheless, the country is subject to diplomatic pressure from the US and others, which can shape its actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-uae&quot;&gt;The UAE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE is pursuing autonomous capabilities and smart weapons through EDGE, a defence conglomerate of multiple national defence companies. In February 2022, EDGE subsidiary Halcon released initial details of its Hunter 2S swarming loitering munition concept, where the company’s CEO remarked on the level of autonomy. Details were scarce, but a Halcon promotional video shows a separate remotely piloted aircraft system conducting reconnaissance of a military installation before a human operator selects several targets. The launch vehicle fires multiple Hunter 2S munitions, which form a swarm. As the munitions approach the target destination, they share data on how to attack each of the selected targets, which includes the allocation of munitions to each target. In the terminal phase, the munitions separate and engage their respective targets as a coordinated swarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE is a growing presence within the international arms sales market and EDGE is already ranked as one of the world’s largest arms exporters. The UAE and EDGE have made clear their intention to become market leaders in key technologies, including autonomous platforms, and to exploit AI-enabled technologies. This, combined with its existing presence on the international arms market, indicates that the UAE is a likely avenue for the proliferation of MOTS LAWS. However, as with Israel and Turkey, the UAE is likely to face pressure from the US and its regional neighbours to avoid selling sensitive technologies to users whose interests might run counter to those of the UAE’s allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-boutique-laws&quot;&gt;IV. Boutique LAWS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While non-state actors or states with smaller budgets might exploit LAWS, these are of lower cost and complexity and are thus likely to be, individually, of lower impact than the boutique systems being explored by the US, China and others. Boutique programmes typically focus on networked sensor integration and stealthy airframes, placing them beyond the reach of all but the richest and most determined nations. Russia aspires to such platforms, but sanctions since its invasion of Ukraine and the cost of rebuilding its forces may well prevent it from pursuing the technology, even if it is technically capable of doing so, which is uncertain. Russian munitions used in Ukraine indicate that Russia relies on Western microelectronics to enable the most basic functions of its advanced weapons, although it is working to wean itself off such dependence. Consequently, the likelihood of boutique autonomy proliferating is lower than for MVP or MOTS LAWS, because of the costs and industrial sophistication involved and the desire by those few nations involved to protect their more sensitive technologies. Should proliferation occur, the impact is significantly greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Air Force Skyborg Programme was established to explore varying degrees of autonomy in human–machine teams. Operating alongside Next Generation Air Dominance, it aims to develop next-generation combat air capabilities, including loyal wingman drones and new command-and-control systems. Others are also developing loyal wingman drones, including Airbus (in Europe), Turkey (Programme Kizilelma), Australia (Ghost Bat) and the UK. China has also joined the fray with its FH-97A, which is orientated towards aerial combat and breaching enemy air defences. The loyal wingman concepts generally seek to unlock difficult missions for air forces such as augmenting aerial situational awareness in heavily defended airspace, or penetration and suppression of enemy air defences, which makes them potentially destabilising, albeit within very specific boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating systems designed to penetrate and defeat national defences could be destabilising, but this should not be overstated. Air defence networks are not perfect solutions and are vulnerable to strikes from the air, land and sea. However, it is possible that future iterations of these and other boutique autonomous weapons could lead to fractious international relations. An example might be the potential effects of autonomous weapons designed specifically to hunt and destroy elements of a country’s nuclear deterrent, such as the US Navy’s Sea Hunter, which is designed to conduct autonomous ocean patrols and track enemy submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about the impact of boutique autonomy on stability focus on how these capabilities may affect strategic decision-making, including timescales and escalation dynamics. States facing each another with boutique LAWS might fear sudden attack, particularly against nuclear capabilities, compressing the timelines for strategic decision-making in an environment where AI is also amplifying disinformation and rhetoric. The US “Star Wars” Strategic Defence Initiative, developed in the late 1980s, drove the Soviet Union to seek asymmetric technologies, such as anti-satellite and silo-defence weapons, and may have contributed to a deterioration in US–Soviet relations. This is the niche into which the kind of boutique autonomy sought by NATO states and China could fit, suggesting cause for concern about the proliferation of these systems if they were to lead to instability between global powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is mixed. Boutique LAWS could create asymmetries of risk through a perception of a lower human cost of war, either encouraging more aggressive behaviour or creating misunderstanding about an opponent’s willingness to contest an issue. Conversely, boutique LAWS could give opposing powers the impression that Western forces are less willing to accept the costs of war escalation, or drive escalation risk, because of their target set. In either scenario, the lack of information about the capabilities of boutique LAWS and their intended uses, as well as the impossibility of knowing what a potential enemy is thinking, suggest caution around development and signalling is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons designed specifically to target an opponent’s nuclear deterrent – autonomous or otherwise – carry immense potential for destabilising the international order and endangering peace and security should one nation feel its nuclear capability can be defeated and thus is no longer a deterrent. This is realistically only within the reach of boutique autonomous technologies and the countries pursuing them. A similar situation may be found in ballistic missile defence capabilities – also technically difficult and within the reach of very few nations – where the destabilising effect on the nuclear balance was such that parties agreed to limit their anti-ballistic missile capabilities through treaties, although the political consensus broke down and the US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in December 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proliferation of boutique autonomy is not impossible, even if it is less likely than for MVP or MOTS. Proliferators will still have to prove that the LAWS on offer either augment existing capabilities or exceed them and enable fundamentally new types of operation, and that they can do this at a competitive price. And, having done that, they will need agreement from their governments, who are likely to wish to protect their highly sensitive technologies. The militaries adopting them are also subject to the innovation challenges discussed by Theo Farrell and David Kilcullen, which, these authors suggest, constrain the capacity for radical change under normal circumstances. It follows that their adoption and proliferation might be accelerated by the threat or outbreak of a major war, either demonstrating their utility or affecting one of the developer nations and pushing them to seek out autonomous solutions. Without some kind of catalyst, development and proliferation of acceptable solutions is likely to take another decade, with gradual increases in capability throughout that period leading up to truly autonomous weapons. Whether the war in Ukraine and US concerns over China’s intentions towards Taiwan are such a catalyst remains to be seen. Even if the technology advances more quickly, the proliferation of the systems themselves may be more limited, given the destabilising impact they pose and the desire of governments to protect the most sensitive technologies that give them an edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If political will and support for expensive programmes such as the Future Combat Air System and Skyborg are maintained, these systems will eventually enter service. However, there is an extensive period of trials and evaluations that the programmes must successfully navigate before this will happen. Because of this, their limited proliferation is considered likely but more constrained than for MOTS products. Furthermore, boutique autonomy may prove very destabilising, depending on the way in which it is employed and the political messaging attached to it. It must be understood that these weapons will enable and inform political decisions, which are what may ultimately lead to war, rather than proliferate war themselves. They may, however, give rise to uncomfortable conversations and questions about a country’s intentions to act. And while traditional weapons can be used to do many of the same things, they are less novel and thus less psychologically threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-proliferation-constraints&quot;&gt;V. Proliferation Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mere existence of LAWS technology is not enough to drive proliferation, let alone amount to its effective fielding. At its highest levels, warfare is an immensely complex human event involving societal pressures that defy simple explanation. At the sharp end of a war, it is common for historians to focus on a specific technology, for example, tank warfare or strategic bombing during the Second World War. However, this form of analysis ignores, whether deliberately or unintentionally, the enormous complexity of militaries at war. LAWS, although not widely used in conflict, fall into a similar trap – easy to analyse based on their individual merits and to assess as a standalone weapon. It is more instructive to consider how they contribute to the totality of an armed force’s or non-state actor’s battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circumstances that lend themselves to the development and proliferation of LAWS can be deduced, enabling assessments of the risks. For example, autonomous weapons designed to locate and engage air defence systems are technically possible and ethically straightforward; they target radar emissions of a certain frequency and nothing else. There are few civilian applications for these frequencies and so the risk of collateral damage is relatively low. The massed and concerted use of these weapons provides an almost immediate boost to the totality of an armed force’s battlefield, assuming that they can be integrated into the military system as a whole and are deployed at the right time and place. The cost–benefit–risk ratio favours these weapons, where the political will exists for their adoption, and the risk of instability is limited, as weapons with the same effect have been used for decades without disrupting the international order. The alternative is to risk expensive, and limited, fleets of aircraft and pilots, and other expensive assets, for example, stocks of ground-based long-range strike missiles, in defeating enemy air defences to achieve control of the air. And without control of the air, ground forces are very vulnerable, so the adoption advantage is clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases, the benefits may be less obvious. Autonomous weapons that select their own targets using optical sensors and computer vision would only be as successful and survivable as the optical suite. Effective imaging systems, although commercially available, are typically very expensive. Furthermore, electro-optics can be disrupted by the use of smoke or camouflage, which in some cases can almost eliminate thermal emissions. Optics are also very vulnerable to fragmentation and air-burst effects used in most conflicts, so, for autonomous ground vehicles at least, they could be damaged or degraded quickly without the manual fallback on which crewed armoured fighting vehicles can rely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with object recognition improving and commercial investment making these technologies more widely available, acquiring the training data required for neural networks to account for all possible target sets the system might encounter is probably beyond the ability of small state or non-state actors, except in the most limited and permissive scenarios. Neural networks typically require large quantities of training data and computing power to improve their accuracy, which increases the training time. Furthermore, AI technologies, such as few-shot learning, are unlikely to overcome some uses of camouflage and deception. Finally, software and programming challenges are accompanied by significant hardware limitations. Complex LAWS need a degree of hardware complexity that is difficult to overcome without significant investment, which in turn leads to additional power requirements that can result in a weight–power spiral. This suggests that MVP and MOTS products are likely to be quite simplistic in nature and limited in their ability to conduct tasks requiring multiple calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adoption advantage requires these limitations to be weighed against what is already possible. Conventional indirect fires are devastating when combined with readily available and cheap drones, such as the DJI Mavic. The training burden is low enough that non-state actors can achieve these effects without having to invest in developing their own programmes. Russian forces in Ukraine have brought accurate artillery fire to bear within five minutes of identifying a target with a drone. This very rapid targeting procedure would be difficult to accelerate because it is limited by how quickly artillery can be loaded, the gun elevated and the round’s travel to the target. Automating the entire process is unlikely to improve the end result (rapid targeting time and precision) beyond the increased survivability conferred by the absence of crews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The massed swarm of autonomous drones, similar to the Hunter 2S, can have significant effects against opponents not prepared for the threat – reputedly IS employed 70 armed drones in a near-simultaneous attack on Iraqi forces in December 2016, halting Iraq’s operations. Remotely operated drones are problematic militarily, but jamming the global navigation satellite system link or the operator’s radio link can degrade and attrit them quickly, leading to high loss rates. Autonomy reduces or eliminates this vulnerability; the drones do not require command links to human operators, while alternatives to satellite navigation, such as an inertial or AI-based navigation, also increase resilience through preloaded coordinates and autonomous target selection. This is increasingly possible using commercial technology from the machine learning and computer vision market. US technology company Nvidia has produced a small nano-computer designed to run AI algorithms, while small-form computing and AI could reduce demands on space, weight and power within UAVs. Commercially available drones can also work as autonomous drone swarms. Autonomous technology could also enable VBIEDs or autonomous surface vessels designed to deliver payloads against ships, increasing an already challenging threat. This is theoretically possible using extant technology and will probably become more prevalent as interest in the technology grows. However, the damage from this type of simple LAWS would currently be quite indiscriminate, more like loitering munitions than truly autonomous weapons, and of limited impact. Ukraine’s strikes against Russian ships and infrastructure using uncrewed aircraft and vessels have been of relatively limited military effect without mass or use in combination with other capabilities such as long-range missiles, although the political effect of individual strikes has been greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to autonomously select a target within the ethical and legal constraints of the laws of armed conflict is problematic because machine learning creates problems that are difficult to answer. It is possible to know the data an algorithm has trained on, and how that might have impacted its decision-making, but in complex environments there are aspects of decision-making that the operator will not understand. Using humans to select targets in real time before releasing LAWS to engage could free forces to conduct other engagements simultaneously, imposing multiple dilemmas on an adversary. For artillery, it could enable “leader–follower” operations, with some uncrewed howitzers in a battery, increasing mass without additional people. However, this is not a truly autonomous weapon according to most definitions. It is worth noting that this kind of technology would generate a swarming challenge that is difficult for today’s armed forces to face. Allowing LAWS to select their own targets introduces uncertainty and reduces the predictability of engagements, so confining automation to parts of the targeting cycle rather than the complete cycle could enhance battlefield outcomes, while limiting some of the potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the challenge to militaries from LAWS is currently manageable. However, LAWS change the approach to defeating enemy capabilities. Most weapons are designed to kill or disable the human operator or, for remotely operated systems, defeat the link between human and machine. Defeating LAWS, however, requires the ability to disable or destroy the platform, which is more difficult. It would require destructive capabilities, for example, man-portable air defence missiles, at all echelons, as well as some form of enhanced intelligence picture to communicate incoming threats quickly. This is expensive, even where relatively fragile MVP LAWS are being employed in mass, as the economic cost of destroying a single LAWS works against the defender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAWS proliferation depends on both the availability of the technology and the adoption advantage. For militaries, modern conventional weapons are very effective at delivering lethal effects when paired with modern software-based solutions, so the bar is high. It is likely, therefore, that autonomy will complement crewed capabilities in many cases. The adoption advantage bar is lower for weaker militaries and non-state actors, but MVP systems are often more fragile and thus more easily countered, although their use at scale poses its own challenges. Boutique systems are very capable, but their cost, complexity and instability potential suggest that their proliferation is less likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous weapons are being used increasingly but are not a homogeneous capability: there are different capabilities with different proliferation and consequence risks. The changing policy framework reflects this; its dual-track approach combines regulation and prohibition, with a growing emphasis on regulation as a form of arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proliferation is a function of the technology’s availability and adoption advantage, which reflects the degree to which the technology provides an edge over a potential adversary. This depends on LAWS being:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As effective as or better than humans and existing weapons in the same role, for example, suppression of enemy air defences or artillery fire.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cheaper than a human or existing weapon in the same role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easy enough to develop and deploy so the opportunity costs of doing so do not outweigh any potential gain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption advantage varies depending on the type of LAWS and the nature of the adversary. This paper identifies three categories of LAWS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MVP:&lt;/strong&gt; These represent a very high proliferation risk, but the systems are currently fragile and less capable than many existing military capabilities. Adoption advantage for MVP LAWS favours criminal and non-state actors and weaker militaries. Stronger militaries need to be prepared to counter these kinds of LAWS, which, while they are unlikely to be hugely destabilising, could be used for isolated atrocities, for example 9/11-type events. Regulating access to MVP LAWS is likely to be impossible, as the knowledge and technology is too widespread, but shaping the environment for their use through clear statements of acceptability (normative control) and criminal law covering the use or sale of technology offers some opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOTS:&lt;/strong&gt; These are more robust and have a higher adoption advantage than MVPs, but they are still complex and require infrastructure and organisational capacity to exploit, so the proliferation risk into militaries and larger non-state actors is high. Many are still supervised systems rather than fully autonomous, but are more challenging to counter than MVPs. Currently, they complement but do not completely replace other conventional capabilities. Further proliferation should be expected, especially from countries or companies with more relaxed attitudes to arms control, and militaries need the ability to counter these systems. The war in Ukraine will accelerate proliferation, as relatively sophisticated weapons are captured and shared with those who will copy them. As MOTS LAWS are largely, but not exclusively, in the hands of governments, some control is possible, including through existing mechanisms of international humanitarian law holding states to account for weapons use, but the problem of definitions still applies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boutique:&lt;/strong&gt; These cost billions of dollars to develop and are difficult to operate, so are only in the hands of a few nations. While they are potentially the most destabilising type of LAWS, this results in their proliferation risk being relatively low, as there is an advantage in not allowing them to proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments – through, among others, their militaries, and police forces where LAWS are used by criminals – need to be able to respond to the risks posed by LAWS, either as users of such systems or because they will be the targets of them. Consequently, they have a vested interest in shaping the debate around LAWS. While an outright ban on all forms of LAWS is no longer practical, opportunities exist to deal with different types of LAWS differently. This will involve a combination of policy and capability choices, including creating space for debate in which the normative case for regulation can be made. This should be accompanied by strengthened criminal legislation dealing with LAWS use, and industrial requirement and export controls covering autonomous systems, and also semi-autonomous systems that could be developed to full autonomy through MVP enhancement. The risks also require the development of counter-LAWS capabilities, for example electronic warfare and integrated defences. As the threats are not just military, governments need information and capability sharing between military and civilian authorities, such as police and intelligence agencies. Ensuring that information-sharing mechanisms exist is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the LAWS debate is focused on ethics, legal definitions and boutique capabilities. There are numerous less capable but militarily potentially useful LAWS being developed that require further examination to understand the adoption advantage and risks because these weapons are likely to proliferate ahead of the exquisite capabilities sought by the world’s major powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future is being written, but it has not been decided – militaries will have to play their part.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳沛敏：7.1佔立會後 黎智英指示報導年輕人心聲 「爭取市民諒解和支持，得以平反」&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;黎智英訪美後要求被訪問 陳沛敏：不感意外或奇怪，黎一向認為需爭取外國施壓&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e2as3R3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（7日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第25日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方就2019年七一佔領立法會提問，訊息紀錄顯示，黎智英在事後指示陳沛敏報導年輕人心聲，「盡量為他們在這件事上爭取市民諒解和支持，得以平反」、「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情」，又要求把「這些 sentiment 擴大擴散，瀰漫成為市民共識」。陳表示黎落指示之後，「我哋就好似要帶住動機去採訪呢件事」，而她最後有落實黎的指示。訊息紀錄又顯示，黎曾提議陳刊登前荃灣區議員岑敖暉的文章，或採訪他就事件的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;雙方續討論逆權英文翻譯-最終採用反威權主義意思&quot;&gt;雙方續討論「逆權」英文翻譯 最終採用「反威權主義」意思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有關昨日陳沛敏提到的「逆權」英文翻譯問題，控方甫開庭便告知法庭，控方認為「逆權」譯作「anti-authority」較合適，但辯方則認為「anti-tyranny」較合適。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻表示，他未能同意控方的見解，因「anti-authority」意思是不接受任何權力管治，暗示「無政府」。彭又稱，他昨晚看過南韓電影《逆權大狀》，內容講述某律師願意接手一宗牽涉政府濫權的案件，所以認為「逆權」有反極權的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過杜麗冰隨即指出，不能盲目地跟從一部電影來翻譯，應該讓法庭傳譯員根據本地脈絡來翻譯「逆權」一字，而昨日把《逆權六月》翻譯做「The June Struggle」是不正確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示控方英文翻譯文本，就同一組中文字「逆權六月」，出現兩種不同英文翻譯，分別是「Revolution June」和「The June Struggle」。杜官認為有少許誤導性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭傳譯員被要求作出決定時，一度猶豫，表示「逆權」會因應「權」所指涉的對象而有不同譯法，她最終表示按前文後理來理解，會認為「逆權」應譯作「anti-totalitarianism」或「anti-authoritarianism」。辯方彭耀鴻表示認同此譯法，控方代表周天行則表示尊重法庭傳譯員的專業性。各方最終同意採用「anti-authoritarianism」作為「逆權」的英文翻譯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，控方有兩年時間準備本案，卻仍欠周詳。杜麗冰亦同意，指控方假設所有法官都同時懂得閱讀中文和英文，可是事實卻不然，當有法官不是雙語時，問題便會浮現。在審訊中多番表示不懂閱讀中文的法官李素蘭，對杜官表示贊同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎智英指示陳沛敏報導佔領立會-盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎智英指示陳沛敏報導佔領立會 「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第四天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著就反修例爆發之後，示威者在七一佔領立法會的事件提問。事後黎智英向前動新聞總監張志偉傳送訊息：「Nick，很好。年輕人衝（擊）立法會事（件）令我心情沈（沉）重，你們認為泛民善後工作有什麼該做令運動可以持續？好彩市民對年輕人闖立法院會是多少有些體諒，損害可能不太大。你們認為呢？謝謝。」、「這年輕父親講得很好，對很多人都會有啓發性。」黎將上述訊息轉發給陳沛敏，又指死守立法會其中一名「死士」的訪問影片有很多人看。陳沛敏回覆：「收到，明天報紙已會有很多衝擊和佔領立會年輕人心聲，包括上述『死士』。明天會再做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後回覆：「是，要再做。明天是否集中做年輕人的心聲，盡量為他們在這件事上爭取市民諒解和支持，得以平反？謝謝。」陳回覆「當然一定有些人不認同衝立會，但這些人也不會因此變成認同林鄭。我們明天會再做。謝謝」。黎再回覆「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎落指示後-好似要帶住動機去採訪&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎落指示後 「好似要帶住動機去採訪」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏供稱，根據訊息紀錄，黎要求把「這些 sentiment 擴大擴散，瀰漫成為市民共識」，即是要求報導年輕人心聲，爭取市民諒解和支持。而她亦嘗試告訴黎，《蘋果》已經報導了年輕爸爸「死士」及示威者放低錢才拿汽水飲，他們意識到佔領立法會是重大事件，已本能地去做報導和記錄。陳續指，「但黎生係有個 intention 想我哋再跟進」，「佢喺訊息俾我哋嘅指示係：衝擊立法會呢件事好有爭議，會令到市民唔再支持呢個運動。所以我哋喺佢未出聲之前，我哋其實都係會採訪呢件事，但係佢講完呢番說話之後，我哋就好似要帶住動機去採訪呢件事」，令市民繼續支持運動，以及「想公眾諒解或支持」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，黎是否希望陳帶著目的去做報導，而且這是否一個指示。陳表示「我理解係」，而最終亦有執行黎的指示。她會與《壹週刊》主管聯絡，先確認他們會否跟進事件，當他們提供示威者訪問後，「我哋會做大，落實黎生嘅指示。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英提議刊登岑敖暉文章或訪問有關佔立會觀點&quot;&gt;黎智英提議刊登岑敖暉文章或訪問有關佔立會觀點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年7月2日的訊息紀錄顯示，黎向陳傳送前學聯副秘書長、前荃灣區議員岑敖暉的 Facebook 文章，問陳：「沛敏，我們可用某種形式刊登這篇文章嗎？甚至給他做個訪問說明。謝謝。」陳回覆：「論壇可刊登。另有他的聯絡嗎？」黎回覆：「我來問。謝謝」，其後再稱：「他是岑敖暉，你應有他的聯絡吧。」陳傳送一個「OK」表情符號。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據訊息紀錄，陳將黎上述訊息轉發給負責論壇版的編輯楊清奇，並問楊「明天見報論壇會否盡量組織有關佔領立會的文章？」、「麻煩你找人聯絡他（岑敖暉）看此文章能否用。謝謝」。楊回覆：「要港聞同事幫幫手吧，睇下有冇佢 contact」，陳傳送了岑的聯絡資訊之後，楊稱：「暫時有四稿，岑未覆，如得，出全版」，又指「楊社」和另一個專欄都會延後出。被問到「楊社」是誰，陳指是《壹週刊》前社長楊懷康，筆名是「古立」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上解釋，由於她覺得不是太適合以新聞形式去處理岑敖暉的文章，或是訪問他，所以問可否刊登岑的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏指黎智英投稿外國媒體和受訪較2019年之前頻密&quot;&gt;陳沛敏指黎智英投稿外國媒體和受訪較2019年之前頻密&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年7月4日，黎智英向陳沛敏傳送一篇文章連結，是黎所撰寫的文章 “What the Hong Kong Protests are really about（〈香港示威究竟是關於什麼〉）”，在7月1日刊登於《紐約時報》。控方指，根據訊息紀錄，黎將相同的文章連結亦傳送至李卓人、何俊仁、WhatsApp 群組「Jim/ Jimmy/ Mark」等。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 黎智英（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問以陳所知，黎在2019至2021年期間，替外國媒體撰文的頻率是怎樣？陳表示：「我講唔到有幾頻密，不過係比2019年之前頻密咗。」控方續問，是否相比2014年較頻密？陳回答：「係，會頻密咗。」控方續問，黎接受外媒訪問的頻率又如何？陳指：「咁2019年之後係頻密過以前囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏為加入蓬佩奧晤黎智英報導-而出第二版報紙&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：為加入蓬佩奧晤黎智英報導 而出第二版報紙&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年7月9日《蘋果》報紙A3版報導〈蓬佩奧晤黎智英討論逃犯例〉。文章上方標註「今晨第二次版」，陳沛敏解釋意思不是印刷第二版，而是印了某一部份數量的報紙後，決定更改內容至第二版，之後根據第二版而印刷餘下數量的報紙。陳指由於當日他們未能趕及在第一版報紙擺放蓬佩奧晤黎智英的報導，為了刊出該報導而出現第二版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何要在第二版加入此報導。陳表示：「因為黎先生去美國見國務卿蓬佩奧，會係重要，會需要改版去處理。」控方追問這何以重要？陳表示，有見黎一直不時傳送外國的文章給她，「佢會好關注外國點樣睇香港嘅運動啦，所以佢今次直情係自己去美國，去見美國國務卿，所以我哋會咁樣處理。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，陳認為黎智英會見蓬佩奧的新聞非常重要，重要到有需要當天盡早刊登，問陳是否同意。陳同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年7月12日刊於報紙的報導〈黎智英晤博爾頓促蓬府援港〉，當中引述《彭博》報導，黎先後會見時任美國副總統彭斯、時任國務卿蓬佩奧、時任美國國家安全顧問博爾頓、共和黨參議員克魯茲、加德納、斯科特會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年7月15日的《蘋果》網上新聞推送通知（push notification），文章題為〈【逆權運動】黎智英籲美發聲支持港人 「以道德力量抗中」〉，報導內容源自《福斯商業網》（Fox Business）文章 “US-China trade negotiations: Moral authority is great leverage against China, Jimmy Lai says”。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據訊息紀錄，控方指「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）於2019年7月19日向黎發送訊息，轉述美國國會議員 Ted Yoho 有意投稿予《蘋果》，希望聯絡編輯。黎遂把相關訊息轉發給陳。陳確認當時有收到 Ted Yoho 的投稿文章，可是不太記得文章內容，相信是關於支持當時香港的運動。至於文章最後有否刊登，陳則不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ok25jsS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（7日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第25日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。她稱黎智英在「飯盒會」上曾經建議「關於運動嘅新聞要做得好」、「關於警暴嘅新聞，佢提我哋要做得深入」。黎於2019年10月到美國會見參議員之後，要求陳「用訪問形式，問我十條左右香港現時情況和這次華盛頓游說之旅問題」，陳遂應要求構思問題，然後交給同事。陳又提到，黎一向認為要爭取外國向香港政府施壓，令政府回應訴求。此外，訊息紀錄顯示，黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 曾向陳提及美國組織「香港民主委員會」前執行總監、正被警方通緝的朱牧民，並提供聯絡電話和電郵給陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑照片見728示威者推著火手推車-惟報紙頭版僅提生雞蛋&quot;&gt;控方質疑照片見7.28示威者推著火手推車 惟報紙頭版僅提「生雞蛋」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第四天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。上午聆訊談及7.1佔立法會之後，黎智英指示陳報導年輕人心聲，以爭取市民支持和諒解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方下午展示2019年7月29日《蘋果日報》頭版，關於7月28日的中上環警民衝突，題為〈生雞蛋來襲 催淚彈還擊警亂 槍狂射平民〉，並指報紙下方有圖片拍攝到示威者在上環西港城推動一架燃燒中的手推車，問為何標題卻只寫「生雞蛋來襲」？陳則表示當天她休假，相關報紙並非由她處理，而是其副手、前執行總編輯林文宗負責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏指黎智英在飯盒會談及時局看法-提醒警暴新聞要深入&quot;&gt;陳沛敏指黎智英在飯盒會談及時局看法 提醒警暴新聞要深入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年8月1日的訊息紀錄，黎邀請陳翌日到他家裡吃晚飯。陳供稱，過往曾經與其他同事一同到黎家中吃午飯，晚飯則比較少。被問到8月該次晚飯討論了什麼話題，陳表示不記得具體內容，只記得黎在場時會談及工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，「後來佢（黎）搞咗個飯盒會」，便會在公司大樓的貴賓房內吃飯，期間黎會向同事表達他對時局的看法。報紙部門的「飯盒會」會每隔數星期舉行一次，出席者包括她、前社長張劍虹和執行總編輯林文宗等。黎談及的話題包括如何令報紙「雜誌化」、內部資訊科技系統等；時局看法方面，黎曾經建議「關於運動嘅新聞要做得好」、「關於警暴嘅新聞，佢提我哋要做得深入」，而張劍虹會負責會議紀錄，事後透過軟件「Slack」發送給其他同事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳記得「飯盒會」由2019年開始舉行，而2020年則持續了一整年。控方指黎於2020年12月起被扣押，問「飯盒會」是否一直有舉行，直至黎還柙。陳則指即使疫情爆發後仍然有開會，但不記得直到哪一個月份為止，因她並沒有出席所有「飯盒會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果廣告提及港台命運共同睇-陳沛敏黎認為台港兩地命運相連&quot;&gt;蘋果廣告提及「港台命運共同睇」 陳沛敏：黎認為台港兩地命運相連&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示《蘋果日報》自己的全版廣告，可見台灣地圖形狀及3名台灣政治人物，包括蔡英文、柯文哲和韓國瑜，大字標題〈明日台灣民主，失守還是堅守？〉，下方顯示「升級壹會員港台命運共同睇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何會使用「港台命運共同睇」字眼，以及這是否當時《蘋果》的立場。陳則指：「『共同睇』係食字，『共同體』係體育嘅『體』，而唔係睇嘢嘅『睇』。」她指上述廣告的意思是，讀者可以用一個價錢，便能在《蘋果》手機 App 上兼看香港和台灣的內容。但她相信控方問題的意思是《蘋果》立場上，是否認為台港兩地命運有相連關係，而「呢個係黎生嘅立場」，因她以往在黎的文章中，以及他在會議上談及時局時，「都會就住台灣講佢嘅意見，所以就知佢嘅立場。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年8月18日的訊息紀錄顯示，黎向陳表示將會接受美國霍士新聞訪問，要求陳替他搜集資料，而陳其後提供相關資料。同日，《蘋果》發出一則推播通知（push notification）：〈【逆權運動】讚美國將反送中跟貿易戰掛鈎 黎智英接受霍士訪問：美國應助港人抗爭〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏曾與黎智英私人助理mark-simon訊息對話&quot;&gt;陳沛敏曾與黎智英私人助理Mark Simon訊息對話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指陳的 WhatsApp 訊息紀錄顯示，她在2019年8月與 Mark Simon 有訊息對話。陳指他是黎的私人助理，她在擔任副總編輯的時候才知道有這個人。被問到曾否與 Mark Simon 面對面交談，陳反問：「可能見到面 Hello，咁算唔算？」，惟她肯定二人不曾詳談。陳又表示不記得第一次見到 Mark Simon 是何時，只記得「咁有個外國人喺公司出現，大家都會八卦吓佢係邊個」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到 Mark Simon 的辦公室是否都在壹傳媒大樓，陳表示「唔肯定」，但她知道 Mark Simon 經常到台灣《蘋果日報》工作，因張劍虹不時赴台灣公幹，回港後提及他在當地見到 Mark Simon。陳相信 Mark Simon 職責是協助黎打理傳媒以外的生意，以及處理黎指派給他的工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指mark-simon提及購買裝備-陳沛敏記者示威現場採訪需要&quot;&gt;控方指Mark Simon提及購買裝備 陳沛敏：記者示威現場採訪需要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，Mark Simon 於2019年8月26日向陳表示，他正身處台灣，可以低價購買大量頭盔、防毒面罩、保護衣，如陳有需要可提出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何 Mark Simon 會談及頭盔、防毒面罩等保護裝備。陳則指當時示威活動很頻密，而記者到現場採訪時需要這些裝備，「因為現場兵荒馬亂，都需要呢啲頭盔、防毒口罩和記者反光衣。」她續指，記憶中這些裝備很難購買，不只《蘋果日報》，其他媒體也面對相同情況，「以前未曾試過帶嗰啲嘢去工作㗎嘛」，所以當 Mark Simon 聲稱可以買到，她便禮貌上回應「好」，但是「冇好認真對待」他的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示mark-simon提及朱牧民新組織-並提供聯絡電話&quot;&gt;訊息顯示Mark Simon提及朱牧民新組織 並提供聯絡電話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2019年9月10日，Mark Simon 再向陳發送訊息，問《蘋果》有否派任何人到美國華盛頓採訪時任香港眾志秘書長黃之鋒和歌手何韻詩的訪美之旅（“Guys, Have we sent anybody in DC to cover the Joshua Wong &amp;amp; Denise Ho trip? Thanks”）。陳回覆有（“Yes”）。Mark Simon 之後再說，牧師朱耀明兒子朱牧民正帶領一個新組織，而且獲得民主黨創黨主席李柱銘和前政務司司長陳方安生的支持（“Great, there’s a new group there headed up by Sam Chu, he’s the son of Reverend Chu. I’m not 100% sure how good they’re going to be but Martin Lee and Anson Chan are backing him.”），其後傳送朱牧民的聯絡電話和電郵給陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上表示，當時並不認識美國組織香港民主委員會（Hong Kong Democracy Council），看到有關朱牧民的新聞時才知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查報導，朱牧民是美國公民，他於2019年9月起擔任美國組織香港民主委員會（Hong Kong Democracy Council）執行總監。2020年7月，《國安法》生效約一個月，警方宣布通緝羅冠聰等6名海外港人，當中包括朱牧民。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又提到，黎智英於2019年9月再度接受外媒霍士新聞訪問，《蘋果》於9月6日發出一則推播通知〈【逆權運動】「如果我們不抗爭會失去所有」 黎智英接受霍士訪問解釋國際支持的重要〉。陳則表示事前並不知道黎受訪，「佢做外媒訪問又唔會通知我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎智英訪美後-要求陳就游說之旅訪問他&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎智英訪美後 要求陳就游說之旅訪問他&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早前開案陳詞提及黎智英於2019年10月22日到美國會見參議員。同日，《蘋果》網站就此報導，題為〈【美國直擊】參議員關注示威暴力升級 黎智英冀美多發聲令青年面對警暴不孤單〉，配圖寫有「國際戰線速報」。控方問《蘋果》有否組織「國際戰線」？陳回答沒有，而且這是網上新聞，她不知道網站同事使用「國際戰線」的考量是什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年10月24日，黎智英傳送訊息給陳：「沛敏，因我今期沒時間寫稿，你是否可以用訪問形式，問我十條左右香港現時情況和這次華盛頓游說之旅問題，我解答作為專欄文章？謝謝。」陳則回覆「👌我度度」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，她當時收到黎的訊息之後，便構思了一些問題，然後傳送給同事，之後再由同事傳送給黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So pleased to welcome Jimmy Lai, Martin Lee and Janet Pang to the U.S. Capitol. My full support and admiration goes to those who have taken to the streets week after week in non-violent protest to fight for democracy and the rule of law in #HongKong. pic.twitter.com/maeTwTR8eV — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) October 22, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏訪美與黎一向立場相符-即爭取外國向香港政府施壓&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：訪美與黎一向立場相符 即「爭取外國向香港政府施壓」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到事後有否與黎討論該次訪美，陳表示沒有特別去討論，因為對於她而言，「佢去美國做嗰樣嘢，同佢一向嘅立場相符，所以我又冇乜好奇怪或好意外嘅問題要問佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎「一向的立場」是怎樣。陳指稱：「佢覺得要爭取外國向香港政府施壓」，當時運動有幾個訴求，除了撤回《逃犯條例》之外，社會上還有聲音質疑是否存在警暴，要求獨立調查事件，黎的立場覺得要透過外國施壓，令政府回應訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到黎有否談及「施壓」是指什麼，陳表示「黎生冇直接同我講過」，不過當時背景是美國眾議院正在審議《香港民主及人權法案》，「佢喺嗰個時間訪問美國，亦都同當時嘅國會議員見面，我相信係呢一類、呢啲法案嘅施壓囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年11月15日《蘋果日報》報紙，其中一篇報導題為〈屠龍隊邊緣呼喚 全民勇武／三罷〉，版面上方印有「樽頸困局」，陳形容這是編輯對當時運動情況的形容。控方補充當時香港發生中大校園暴動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問此報導以什麼角度來撰寫。陳指這是一個人物訪問，「佢屬於比較激進啲嘅團體，佢呼籲標題所講嘅嘢，同埋解釋點解要呼籲囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄又顯示，陳沛敏和林文宗就一幅題為「請投票止警暴」海報討論。陳指黎吩咐她去找一些新聞圖片讓他揀選，相信是協助一些政黨去製作海報，是有關2019年區議會換屆選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（6日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第24日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。她供稱，過往《蘋果》只會在七一大遊行當日，於報紙其中一頁全版印刷由尊子操刀的政治漫畫，不過在2019年4月28日的反送中大遊行，《蘋果》卻破例地在當天報紙做同樣的事。陳形容黎很重視該次遊行，立場上亦鮮明地反對修例，並相信他「支持抗爭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎智英問陳沛敏有關林榮基資料-相關內容其後現於黎專欄文章&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎智英問陳沛敏有關林榮基資料 相關內容其後現於黎專欄文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第三天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳昨天談及《蘋果》頭版報導前銅鑼灣書店店長林榮基赴台一事，並稱這是她的決定。控方今展示2019年4月26日的訊息紀錄。陳解釋，黎問她有關林榮基的資料，於是她向黎智英傳送林榮基的維基百科連結和港台節目《鏗鏘集》的連結，之後黎傳來一段文字，「佢應該就將嗰啲資料綜合成一段文字，問我 fact check 啱唔啱。」陳相信黎當時正在撰寫個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」。控方遂展示黎的專欄文章〈請站出來保住最後防線〉，內文含有林榮基的描述。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏蘋果以往只在七一全版印政治漫畫-2019年4月反送中遊行破例&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：《蘋果》以往只在七一全版印政治漫畫 2019年4月反送中遊行破例&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2019年4月26日黎向陳傳送語音訊息，指不能每一份報紙都印海報，建議陳問工黨李卓人需要多少海報，《蘋果》便印多少，然後供他們在現場派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏於2019年4月27日凌晨向黎傳送政治漫畫的設計草圖，寫有「反惡法 倒林鄭」字樣，以及顯示「黑獄」的鐐銬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示一張4月28日遊行現場的相片，由陳傳送給黎，相中一名遊行人士舉起《蘋果日報》，分別展示當天頭版和全版政治漫畫。頭版有前港督彭定康、林榮基、佔中案被告戴耀廷、陳健民、黃浩銘、邵家臻和陳淑莊，題為「今日上街反惡法」，而政治漫畫則與陳早前傳送給黎的草圖相同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，如果當日有大型遊行的話，《蘋果》會邀請政治漫畫家尊子設計一個漫畫，然後全版印刷，不過此做法以往只限於七一遊行當日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問2019年之後，《蘋果》在全版印刷漫畫上有否改變？陳指當時4月的遊行是關於反對逃犯條例，「嗰次我哋破例喺4月廿幾號都有做到呢樣嘢囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英重視4月反送中遊行-相信他支持抗爭&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英重視4月反送中遊行 相信他支持抗爭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何《蘋果》會破例於4月的遊行全版印刷政治漫畫？陳表示不肯定，「當時黎生都好重視呢個遊行，所以我哋就都有印嗰個漫畫出嚟囉。」控方追問陳何以感覺到黎重視該次遊行？陳指：「佢（黎）不斷 send 訊息過嚟畀我哋，睇吓點樣令多啲人上街，同埋問我哋會唔會幫民陣印海報。」被問到黎對於抗爭有何立場，陳表示：「我諗佢係支持抗爭，同反對（修例）囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8yQExuk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指每次有意在報紙上全版印刷政治漫畫，她都會請示社長張劍虹。控方追問，張劍虹是否需要向某些人請示？陳表示不肯定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎智英託羅傑斯邀請彭定康評論反送中-並著陳報導&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎智英託羅傑斯邀請彭定康評論反送中 並著陳報導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示黎的訊息，他於2019年4月27日向陳沛敏稱：「沛敏，請想想有什麼我們還可做催谷市民明天上街？現在情況實在太靜，好驚。謝謝。」黎其後轉發羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）的訊息，羅傑斯指彭定康可能身在法國，又建議黎找《蘋果》記者自行找彭定康訪問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示羅傑斯傳送給陳沛敏的訊息，當中轉述彭定康對反對《逃犯條例》修訂的評論，著陳可以報導。彭定康形容修例是對香港價值和繁榮穩定造成傷害，亦會為營商環境帶來恐懼和不確定性，直接衝擊香港法治制度下的「一國兩制」和高度自治，又會危害政治行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後庭上展示2019年4月28日當日《蘋果日報》的實體報紙，A2版顯示報導文章〈彭定康：修例損港地位 衝擊自主〉。控方提到，版面上方有「今日反惡法」字眼，問這是誰的主意。陳僅指鐐銬破碎的圖像是由美術部同事畫的，而「今日反惡法」字眼則由編輯根據報導主題而構思出來。她和執行總編輯林文宗核稿時會見到相關字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另指當天報紙A3是一個全版廣告，顯示一個手銬，寫著字句「你確定自己不是逃犯？」、「剖析真相守護公義」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏2019年4至5月-反送中一直是蘋果主題-黎智英鮮明地反修例&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：2019年4至5月 「反送中」一直是《蘋果》主題 黎智英鮮明地反修例&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年4月22日《蘋果日報》報導，題為〈4.28 反惡法 民陣號召上街抗送中例 阻中共越港人紅線〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問4月28日之前，該4.28遊行是否一直是《蘋果日報》的主題？陳回答「係」之後，接著問「我可唔可以講一句？」，並回應早前庭上統一以「evil law」作為「惡法」的英文翻譯，她表示：「我覺得用 draconian 準確啲。」法官李運騰則回應，為了確保所有人都知道談論同一件事，有需要使用一致的翻譯字眼，否則會引致含糊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年5月21日《蘋果日報》報導，題為〈黎智英：修例後香港玩完 FCC演講斥林鄭非常邪惡〉。控方特別指出，報導另提及黎稱從沒有感到疲累，「因為需要負起作為反對聲音的責任，而這令我的人生非常有意義」，但黎「也笑言日後一旦修例成功，他或是時候退休」。法官李運騰質疑控方提問與案件是否相關：「我們沒有興趣知道黎先生想退休與否。」控方則表示這與稍後的提問有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問「反惡法」這個主題是否由2019年4月起，直到5月都沒有變過？陳確認「係」。她續指，因為當時政府正在推行修改法例程序，「民間都仍然有就住呢條條例討論，咁泛民都有評論想政府擱置呢條條例啦」，而且從報導可見，「咁呀黎生都仲有嚟反對呢條條例啦，所以我哋都會有呢啲報導。」控方追問黎的新聞如何與事件相關？陳指：「啫係佢都好鮮明咁反對呢條條例。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英轉發董橋建議-著陳沛敏討論找有份量人士談反送中&quot;&gt;黎智英轉發董橋建議 著陳沛敏討論找有份量人士談反送中&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年5月31日的訊息紀錄，黎向陳轉發前《蘋果日報》社長、著名作家董橋的訊息，董稱：「Jimmy，出來號召民眾上街的人選非常重要。」，又建議訪問民主黨創黨主席李柱銘和天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機，「你們的報紙每天有個方塊讓有份量的人說幾句『送中』看法，六月九日的人數會多很多。我們要鼓吹的不是香港要民主，我們要求鼓吹的是香港的價值不容共產黨摧殘。」黎著陳：「下午有時間談談董橋建議。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長、著名作家 董橋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，黎希望她6月9日之前「搵多啲有分量嘅人講吓對《逃犯條例》嘅憂慮」，因為「佢（黎）覺得再由泛民嘅人講，太冇新意，叫我搵啲新嘅人講」。她便按照黎的指示，與同事商量，盡量找一些不同人士談論《逃犯條例》，雖然不可能聯絡法官做訪問，但也會盡量找法律界人士受訪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（6日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第24日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。《蘋果日報》在2019年7月1日隨報附送特刊《逆權六月》，法官李運騰問及為何特刊是免費派發而不是售賣，陳則指希望讀者能多買報紙，以示對運動的支持，又能收宣傳之效。她一度就「逆權」的英文翻譯表達見解，指譯作「Struggle」會較「Revolution」更準確。控方問「逆權運動」一詞是否源自特刊《逆權六月》這名稱。陳則指「逆權」兩字其實原初在中文並不常用，但數年前韓國推出幾套電影均以「逆權」為題，包括《逆權司機》和《逆權大狀》，所以「逆權」才開始為香港普羅大眾所認識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎智英指示陳沛敏訪問學生-激發其他學生69出來&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎智英指示陳沛敏訪問學生 「激發其他學生6.9出來」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第三天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 高級檢控官 吳加悅（左）、助理刑事檢控專員 張卓勤（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早上就2019年4至5月的事件提問，陳形容黎智英鮮明地反對修例，並非常重視4月28日的反送中遊行。控方下午繼而就2019年6月的事件提問，陳沛敏確認黎智英當時仍然是重視抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示 WhatsApp 訊息紀錄，在6月9日反送中大遊行之前，黎向陳稱：「沛敏，我們應該找些聯署學生訪問，激發其他學生6.9出來。謝謝。」陳確認收到訊息後，有著同事去做學生訪問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏確認對百萬人上街感高興-黎就頭條標題給予建議&quot;&gt;陳沛敏確認對百萬人上街感高興 黎就頭條標題給予建議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年6月9日的訊息紀錄，當天有超過一百萬人參與反送中大遊行。黎在下午向陳稱有很多人上街，陳回覆：「是的，今天會很多人」，黎續稱：「應該超過一百萬！」陳在晚上再傳訊息：「愈夜愈美麗」及「103萬」。控方問，陳和黎是否都對過百萬人參與遊行感到高興？陳同意：「係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示同日訊息，前《蘋果日報》社長、著名作家董橋向黎稱：「Jimmy，你和你的報紙的努力沒有白費！為勇敢的香港人乾杯！」黎回覆董：「Haha！對，為勇敢的香港人乾杯！好！我告訴沛敏，這是個好標題，謝謝。」其後黎將上述兩則訊息轉發給陳，並說：「沛敏，董橋以上說，為勇敢香港人乾！會是個好標題，請看是否適合，謝謝。」陳則回覆：「好的，我們研究一下，或用地道的語言表達這意思。謝謝」，黎回覆：「好。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年6月10日的《蘋果日報》頭版，標題為〈香港人漂亮的固執 1,030,000〉。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日訊息紀錄顯示，「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）曾向陳沛敏傳送一則《蘋果》網上新聞連結，題為〈【引渡惡法】「香港監察」羅哲斯拍片撐港人上街：通過修例如判香港死刑〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英認為暫緩修例只是策略-616前夕頭版籲上街-與黎意見一致&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英認為暫緩修例只是策略 6.16前夕頭版籲上街 與黎意見一致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，黎智英於2019年6月14日向陳傳送訊息：「胡志偉他估計待6月尾的G20峰會習近平主席和特朗普會面過後，市民抗議聲音減少，令習主席不會在美國面前丟面後，條例就會捲土重來。」黎又稱：「我們只好行動日漸加劇，迎接詭計來臨！」、「不撤一散（不撤不散）！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年6月15日的《蘋果日報》頭版，題為〈惡法擬暫緩但不撤，遊行前夕，林鄭緩兵，明天照上街〉，並問此報紙標題與黎的意見有沒有關係。陳表示：「都有嘅」，雖然當時政府宣布暫緩修例，但是黎認為此舉「只係一個策略」，「要撤回先至可以達到嗰個目的囉。」她認同頭版標題與黎的意見一致，因她考慮標題時「係有考慮佢嘅意見」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年6月26日的訊息，黎智英告知陳沛敏，他已落了飛機，陳問黎是否需要記者採訪他參與遊行。陳解釋，因為黎是一名公眾人物，「睇吓佢使唔使派記者去採訪佢遊行」。控方指黎使自己變成新聞的一部份，問陳會否同意此說法，陳同意：「係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;七一蘋果附送逆權六月特刊-官問為何免費派發而非售賣賺錢&quot;&gt;七一《蘋果》附送《逆權六月》特刊 官問為何免費派發而非售賣賺錢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年7月1日的《蘋果日報》頭版，題為〈惡法未撤回 林鄭未下台 今日再上街〉，頭版上方寫有「隨報送《逆權六月》特刊」。陳解釋，該特刊主要將攝影師所拍攝的反送中事件和示威遊行照片結集。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，為何《蘋果日報》要隨報附送特刊或海報？陳表示，因為他們估計大部份《蘋果》讀者都是反對修例，加上早前有百萬人上街，相信很多人會想保存該特刊。李官續指，問題重點是，為何《蘋果》不打算售賣該特刊來賺錢，而是免費地派發？陳表示：「如果要印到好靚嘅話先至會有人買囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問，既然讀者不論如何都會支持這份報紙，為何仍要大費周章？還是這是一種宣傳方式？陳回應：「都可以話係一個宣傳。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上將逆權譯成revolution-陳沛敏認為譯struggle較準確&quot;&gt;庭上將「逆權」譯成「revolution」 陳沛敏認為譯「struggle」較準確&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏其後就「逆權」一詞的英文翻譯表達見解，因之前庭上將《逆權六月》翻譯成「Revolution June」，惟陳認為將「逆權」翻譯成「struggle」會較準確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂問她是否同意「權」可譯作「authority」或「power」。陳同意，並指可理解為「當權嘅人或組織」。法官杜麗冰問陳是否意指「政府」？陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「逆」字，陳表示理解為：「反對當權者。簡單啲嚟講，好似法官咁講，反對政府。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏逆權兩字起初在中文不常用-韓國電影以逆權為名-香港人始認識&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：「逆權」兩字起初在中文不常用 韓國電影以「逆權」為名 香港人始認識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，陳想透過這本特刊達到什麼目的？是想用作宣傳還是賺錢？陳認為「兩者都有」，當然他們希望讀者買多些《蘋果日報》，「都係對呢個運動支持的表現。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，「逆權運動」這詞經常出現於《蘋果日報》，問是否源於特刊名稱「逆權六月」？陳表示「我唔肯定」，因「逆權」兩字其實原初在中文並不常用，但數年前韓國推出幾套電影均以「逆權」為題，包括《逆權司機》和《逆權大狀》，所以「逆權」才開始為香港普羅大眾所認識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何要用「逆權」而不用「反政府」一詞，陳指當時香港經歷了6.9和6.16兩次大遊行，要概括兩次遊行的話，「諗住用呢兩個字，唔使咁直接⋯⋯概括啲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，若要比較「反送中」和「逆權」兩個詞語，哪一個反抗程度會較強？陳回答：「反送中係講緊條條例嘛，咁 『權』就係講緊嗰政府囉。」李官指，「逆權」的重點並不是太在於修例草案，而是較著重政府的行為，問陳是否同意。陳表示：「可以咁講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭之前，法官杜麗冰指「逆權」一詞不太容易理解，籲控辯雙方律師團隊集思廣益，商討出一個最貼切的英文翻譯，又指不能依靠證人對該詞的理解去翻譯。代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻則指，以陳沛敏處理「逆權」這詞的經驗，以及她從流行文化、韓國電影理解「逆權」的意思，她確實有基礎提出其見解。法官李運騰則認為要證人處理翻譯是不公平，況且有需要就字詞的翻譯達至統一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessments of the state of the Islamic State, including of its branches, are routinely released by policy makers and official sources. These assessments, however, are often divergent. The UN monitoring reports, based on data fed by member states indicate numbers that fluctuate wildly year on year, depending on the member state. The same agency might release contrasting figures, such as the US Forces Afghanistan’s assessment of the strength of the Islamic State in Khorasan (IS-K) before the Taliban takeover in 2021. For years it was kept at an astonishingly low 1,000 members, until it was suddenly raised to 5,000 in spring 2019, without much explanation. While assessments by the US military were mostly keeping IS-K numbers low, Russian official sources tended to do the exact opposite. Hence the need for an independent, fresh assessment of just how powerful IS-K is, one of the aims of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other aim of this paper is to analyse how IS-K coped with the emerging challenge posed by the Taliban in power in Kabul. Even as recently as the summer of 2023, the predominant view among analysts was that IS-K was in good shape, in part at least because of its efforts to project its activities regionally. Acknowledging IS-K’s internal difficulties has been rare. This paper shows that IS-K has been increasingly struggling in Afghanistan, but also that it has been to adapt to a very considerable extent. The question this paper seeks to answer is what this adaptation is turning IS-K into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the conflict is still underway, any findings of this paper can be only partial and preliminary. With no access to primary written sources, there are limitations by necessity to the research methodology adopted: primarily oral sources, supported by news reports. The reader should be aware that researching this topic required several methodological compromises, as reaching out to sources in the context of Afghanistan under the Taliban is extremely difficult. IS-K recruiters and members were the most difficult ones to speak to. As a result, the body of data collected is inevitably incomplete; gaps abound, and following up on specific themes was often not possible. The analysis contained in the paper inevitably reflects this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis is based on a series of fifty-five interviews, carried out between March 2021 and June 2023 with ten Taliban officials, sixteen IS-K cadres and members, eight former IS-K members, twelve Salafi elders, Ulema and other elders, four members of the Tehrik Taliban Pakistan, two Hawala traders, one IS Central cadre, one Iranian official, and one local source. The interviews were carried out by three researchers who did not know each other, to avoid the risk of collusion in manipulating the content of the interviews. The interviewees were told that their answers would be used in a publication, the type of which was not specified. All the interviews have been anonymised and all data that could lead to the identification of interviewees has been removed. The risk that respondents could use the interviews to influence or misrepresent the facts was assumed from the start as a precautionary measure. This risk was mitigated by using different types of sources, representing contrasting points of views, by interviewing individuals separately and without them being aware of other interviews taking place, and by inserting questions where the answer was already known. Public-domain sources have also been used, where available, to check the credibility of interviewees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is organised into several sections. The first one discusses IS-K’s initial strategy against the Taliban’s Emirate. The second section addresses how that strategy started appearing as a dead end during 2022. The third section shows how IS-K sought to adapt its strategy. The fourth and final section discusses how IS-K’s crisis deepened in 2023 and was still very serious as of January 2024, when this paper was drafted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-ks-challenge-to-the-taliban-in-2021-22&quot;&gt;IS-K’s challenge to the Taliban in 2021-22&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has long been a debate on whether IS-K was really closely connected to the central leadership of the Islamic State (IS-C), rather than being a group of opportunists who tried to exploit the 2014-15 successes of IS-C for fundraising and recruitment purposes. That IS-K still existed in 2018-23 despite the decline of the Caliphate in Syria and in Iraq bears witness to the fact that its emergence was not just due to opportunism. Over the years, IS-C sought the original, heterogeneous mix of groups into a more ideological, Salafi-jihadist organisation. The transformation was quite successful, helped by the high casualty rate incurred by the first generation of joiners. By 2021, IS-K was a largely Salafi organisation, with a strong a committed hard core of ideologically motivated members. For the largest part of its existence, IS-K was heavily dependent on funding accruing from IS-C, but the latter allowed IS-K a degree of autonomy in choosing its leaders — if the process was smooth and not too divisive. During the period discussed in this paper, however, the decline and crisis of IS-C started posing major challenges to IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban takeover in August 2021 was no good news for IS-K. The Taliban had been IS-K’s primary enemy, and it could be expected that they would turn on the IS-K as soon as feasible after power consolidation. The leadership of IS-K decided to catch the Taliban off guard while the latter were busy setting up their government and suffering from manpower shortages. Tens of cells were transferred to the cities, where in the following months they unleashed their most intense terror campaign yet. Not only in Kabul and Jalalabad, where IS-K had been active for years, but also Kunduz, Kandahar, Charikar, Herat and Mazar-I Sharif. In addition, IS-K sought to unleash a guerrilla campaign in eastern Afghanistan. The Taliban initially struggled to cope, especially in the cities where they had no counter-terrorism experience. Provincial officials of the Emirate in eastern Afghanistan adopted extreme measures against the Salafi community, widely believed to be largely supportive of IS-K, including death squad tactics in Nangarhar and systematic closures of Salafi mosques and madrasas. This deeply antagonised the Salafi community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IS-K terror campaign peaked in the first half of 2022 and started losing steam in the second half of the year, as the Taliban were finally getting on top of the counter-terrorism challenge. From a peak of between five to ten guerrilla attacks and over ten bomb attacks per month during the first half of 2022, IS-K activity fell to between two and five guerrilla attacks and three to six bomb attacks in the second half of the year (see graph 1 ). By then it could be argued that the guerrilla campaign in the east had declined to negligible levels, as confirmed by local observers too. The terror campaign in the cities was beginning to falter too, however. Moreover, there were no signs that terror attacks in the cities were achieving much in terms of destabilising the Emirate, which was gradually also overcoming its initial manpower shortages. Despite still being short of cash, in January 2022 the Emirate quickly upgraded its plans for army and police, overseeing the gradual expansion of the army towards a target of at least 150,000 men, and the police to as many as 60,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K’s main aim with its 2021-22 offensive was likely to buy time, while it restructured to face the mutating threat represented by the Taliban. The process of strengthening its presence in the north of Afghanistan had already started by 2020 but intensified after the Taliban takeover. The residual overt presence of IS-K — limited by August 2021 to some areas of Nuristan and Kunar — started being disposed of, as IS-K moved entirely underground and began relying exclusively on mobile bases and training camps. In its new shape, IS-K had little use for large numbers of foreign fighters — mostly Pakistanis, followed by Central Asians as the second largest group — and the bulk of them started being moved to Pakistan either to Tirah valley, where had some bases, or to the cities, primarily Peshawar. IS-K also massively intensified its online and social media operations, presumably with multiple intents such as distracting the Taliban from its delicate transition, exchanging face-to-face with remote recruitment, enhancing fund raising, and keeping an increasingly dispersed membership together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All considered, the leadership of IS-K managed the transition quite efficiently, taking limited casualties. However, the Taliban’s Emirate had not just been increasing the size of its armed forces. Its intelligence apparatus adapted to its new tasks, building an extensive intelligence network in the cities. During 2022 the Taliban started busting IS-K cells in the cities, and terrorist attacks stopped in Kunduz, Charikar and Jalalabad. Several cells were also destroyed in Kabul, Mazar-i Sharif, and Herat (see Graph 1 for figures). The Taliban’s intelligence also started infiltrating IS-K social media operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K’s adaptation also faced some structural limitations. The increasingly dispersed character of the organisation made its trademark centralised command and control unfeasible. The group likely also faced a shortage of cadres, as the cells compromised in the cities during 2022 often included quite senior members. It would be odd for IS-K to move senior figures to the frontlines, unless it faced major command and control issues and/or a shortage of cadres. The expansion of IS-K’s presence in the cities, relying on an underground structure of small cells, required a much more cadre-heavy staffing than the guerrilla operations had demanded. IS-K tried to intensify recruitment of new cadres, but the Taliban’s crackdown on Salafi madrasas (outside Kunar province) choked a major source of recruits. IS-K had to rely increasingly on recruiting university students, itself a complicated matter due to heavy Taliban scrutiny over the campuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, IS-K appears to have been able to maintain its numbers between August 2021 and autumn 2022. During this period, IS-K sources were putting total membership at around 8,000 between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Considering that a substantial portion of these were in Pakistan at any given time, these numbers are well within the range of estimates by governments reporting to the UN monitoring committee. This is not quite as good as it seems, given that this membership level is close to its lowest during 2015-21, but at least numbers did not fall. Of the 8,000 or so members, at least a third were in non-combat roles (support, intelligence, admin), and of the 5,000 or so fighters a substantial portion were Salafi villagers who had joined to protect their communities and were poorly motivated to follow IS-K very far. The Salafi community had felt threatened when the Taliban appeared in eastern Afghanistan in strength from 2009 onwards. Having failed to obtain protection from the government, they welcomed IS-K when it turned up years later, as a force capable of protecting them. It is a common tale, heard from surrendered IS-K members, that many Salafi elders were encouraging villagers to join IS-K, whose teams had regular meetings with them, encouraging them to mobilise villagers. Especially among these villagers, morale was low in 2021 already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-ks-campaign-in-crisis-winter-2022-23&quot;&gt;IS-K’s Campaign in Crisis: Winter 2022-23&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban reacted to IS-K’s challenge more quickly and with greater sophistication than expected, ordering its provincial officials to avoid indiscriminate repression of the Salafis and promoting instead efforts to reconcile IS-K members, by both involving community elders and offering reintegration packages. Although arbitrary violence against suspect IS-K members and sympathisers — peaking in the first few months after regime change — did not stop altogether, the Taliban’s efforts were quite successful; in Nangarhar province a few hundred IS-K insurgents reconciled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the winter of 2022-23 it was clear that the campaign launched by IS-K was not achieving much success in undermining the Taliban’s Emirate. Although IS-K managed to sustain the pace of its terrorist attacks in Kabul and to start a campaign in Mazar-I Sharif — and in Herat, to some extent — its campaign in Jalalabad failed and the campaigns in Kunduz and Kandahar could not be sustained. Indeed, an IS-K source mentioned in April 2023 that Kabul, Mazar-i Sharif, and Herat were the cities where their urban terror cells were concentrated. Even in Kabul, IS-K had been taking several hits. The same IS-K source acknowledged that in February 2023 the head of the special military commission for Kabul, Qari Saheb Fateh, was “martyred” by the Taliban. Interestingly, according to an IS-K cadre, as of April 2023 no replacement had been appointed yet, again suggesting that the Taliban counter-terrorism campaign might be causing a shortage of senior cadres. Another IS-K source acknowledged that recruitment teams took several hits in Kabul, Nangarhar and Kunar, with members arrested or killed; only Badakhshan remaining untouched. These hits resulted in much reduced activities, especially in Kabul, where, after one terrorist attack on 11 January 2023 and one on 27 March 2023, there was a lull of seven months with no successful IS-K attack. Both these attacks targeted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ending up with detonations outside the Ministry, resulting in civilian casualties but little damage to the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K propaganda regularly claims it is strengthening recruitment, has the support of 70% of the population in the east and north-east, and even that it is attracting growing numbers of sympathisers in the south as well. Ironically, when comparing claims made by internal IS-K sources on recruitment alongside previous claims (see above), this reveals in fact that overall IS-K numbers were declining significantly in late 2022 and into early 2023: falling to 7,000 by the beginning of 2023. In practice, IS-K’s presence in Afghanistan was shrinking even faster, as an increasing number of its members were being moved to Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious that the Taliban’s efforts to reconcile IS-K members through negotiations with the elders was making a dent in the latter’s self-confidence. Although the pace of the surrenders slowed during the end of last year and in recent months, in early 2023 another 100 reportedly surrendered in Nangarhar, later acknowledged by IS-J sources. According to one former member, even some of the reinforcements sent by IS-K to Nangarhar from Kunar decided quickly to surrender. Similarly, the campaign to attract Taliban members was clearly lagging. Despite IS-K propaganda touting successes in infiltrating the Taliban, there is little evidence of success. In fact, open defections to IS-K, which were never high, appear to have slowed down to a near halt between the beginning of 2022 and mid-2023. The Taliban dismissed the few defectors as people expelled for bad behaviour or who quit for not having been offered prestigious jobs within the ranks of the Emirate. For example, one of the few cases of Taliban joining IS-K during that period was that of a minor commander called Sangari; in January 2023 Sangari defected to IS-K with his three men in Lal Poor district, after the Emirate failed to give him a job. While the Taliban might well be reluctant to acknowledge defections from their ranks, as late as June 2023 a senior source in IS-K could not provide concrete examples of recent defections and talked instead of “negotiations” with “several groups of Taliban in different provinces” over their defection to IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting this reality, IS-K propaganda has shifted from defections towards claims of infiltration of the Taliban. One known case of an official of the Emirate detained on allegations of having links to IS-K was that of Obaidullah Mobariz, the Emirate’s Chief of Police for Panjshir’s Shotul district — detained on 16 January 2023. Mobariz had been detained by the previous government for links to IS-K. The Emirate appointed him and seemingly was unaware of his past until his suspicious behaviour attracted attention; a serious security lapse. There were also allegations, relaunched by IS-K sources, of receiving internal help for their attack on the governor of Balkh — Muzamil — in March 2023. However, few other attacks carried out by IS-K after the Taliban takeover suggest insider support. Typically, these attacks were failures in terms of attempts to break through Taliban security belts. The few successful ones were mostly against pro-Taliban clerics, who did not occupy official positions within the Emirate and were not protected by the Taliban’s security apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K’s difficulties are also evident from their 2023 propaganda efforts on Telegram, encouraging members to escalate jihadi activities during the holy month of Ramadan (22 March-20 April 2023); embarrassingly, IS-K activities during that month were at their lowest level ever. A more implicit admission of the group’s decline in Nangarhar was a letter published by them, warning of retaliation to those extorting money from shopkeepers and other citizens of Jalalabad in the name of IS-K. While the letter’s intent was likely to show that IS-K still had power, as it encouraged the shopkeepers to report extortion to its intelligence service, the letter also revealed that small time gangsters were not afraid of IS-K anymore; perhaps even that isolated and under-funded IS-K members were now on the loose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-ks-adaptation&quot;&gt;IS-K’s Adaptation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an IS-K cadre, during 2022 the leadership of IS-K decided to adapt its strategy: it abandoned any short-term plans to hold or re-gain territory, even in the remotest parts of the country, and instead focusing on targeting cadres and leaders of the Taliban and intensifying recruitment efforts. The aim of challenging the Taliban’s territorial control remained but was moved to the long-term. In line with this, during 2022 IS-K gave up on plans to wage a guerrilla campaign in Kunar, the primary intent of which had been to force the Taliban to pull out of parts of the province. The assessment of a member of the Taliban’s General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) was that by early 2023 there was little IS-K activity in Kunar: “they have some hideouts in the mountains and in the valleys, but they don’t have permanent military bases in Kunar province”. The source believed that IS-K was facing morale issues, with members reluctant to fight, even if not ready to surrender to the Taliban: “Because there are lots of places for hiding out in the valleys and mountain, these Khawarij Daesh prefer to stay there, rather than surrender to the Taliban”. As noted above in IS-K’s challenge to the Taliban, IS-K have faced morale issues, so this GDI officer’s assessment is plausible. However, he also acknowledged that while “local villagers received warnings from the Taliban, not to support [IS-K], some Salafi families and communities” were still “secretly supporting [IS-K] members and offering safe haven in their villages”. While the source estimated in March 2023 that IS-K had been crushed in Nangarhar province, large scale IS-K activity underground still existed within Kunar province. Overall, only 30-40 members of IS-K were confirmed to have surrendered in Kunar, as opposed to more than 600 in Nangarhar (up to March 2023).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, IS-K was not finished yet. The group was re-organising and learning to rely on thinner, underground networks of cells in the villages, focusing on maintaining influence and keeping recruitment growing rather than fighting. In the words of a surrendered IS-K member: “During the night, [IS-K is] very powerful in the valleys and villages close to the mountains, but during the day they disappear”. Despite the decision to move north (see above), IS-K could not just abandon its strongholds in the east to their fate. According to a source in the Taliban, in March 2023 Kunar was also still functioning as the source of IS-K cells re-infiltrating other areas. Both Kunar and neighbouring Nuristan did not just supply cells to Nangarhar, but also to Kabul and possibly other provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A considerable proportion of IS-K forces in Kunar was nonetheless moved to Pakistan and to the north of Afghanistan during 2021-23. The relocation northwards had started slowly in mid-2020 but there is clear evidence that it started accelerating in 2022. IS-K sources placed the number of IS-K members in the north and north-east in early 2023 at least double the numbers present there in mid-2021. Even GDI sources confirmed in March 2023 the shift of IS-K members to the north-east, with a growing presence in the north as well. Several small bases were identified in Badakhshan and Kunduz, while there were believed to be several cells in Mazar-I Sharif. The north-east was believed to be supplying attack teams, composed of Central Asians, to Kabul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transferring many members northwards was undoubtedly a considerable feat for IS-K. However, in terms of inflicting critical damage to the Emirate there, impact was limited. On 9 March 2023, the governor of Balkh, Mohammad Daud Muzamil — one of the most capable Helmandi commanders of the Emirate and a close ally of the Amir, Haibatullah — was assassinated in Mazar-i Sharif. This attack was part of a campaign of assassinations of Taliban officials; as of October 2023 these were only carried out in the new areas of IS-K activity: north, north-east, and west. Aside from Muzamil, the other main success of this campaign was the killing of Nissar Ahmad Ahmadi, the deputy governor of Badakhshan province, on 6 June 2023; this was followed two days later by a suicide bombing at Ahmadi’s funeral, killing three other Taliban dignitaries plus several bystanders. Low rank officials of the Emirate were also assassinated: Mohammad Nader Kakar, head of Herat’s Water Supply Department, in March 2023; director of mines Abdul Fattah, in Faizabad on 24 April 2022; security chief Abdulhaq Abu Omar also in Faizabad on 26 December 2022; and Rahman Munawar, the Taliban Head of Economy for Faryab province, on 10 October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although in the big scheme of things these attacks did not even get close to making the Taliban’s hold on northern Afghanistan implode, even the GDI acknowledged that the situation in Mazar-i Sharif was somewhat worrying. The GDI estimated in April 2023 that there were dozens of IS-K hideouts in Mazar, with some 200 members already based in the city and another 150 planning to move in. Based on the interrogation of the detainees, the GDI assessed that IS-K intended to destabilise the Emirate by attacking the northern cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2020, one major problem for IS-K in trying to spread through the north was that the organisation had a stronger Salafi character than when it was originally formed in 2014-15. Of the original crowd of former TTP and Taliban members, many of whom did not identify as Salafis, little was left by that time; IS-K rejected being characterised as a Salafist group. The Taliban’s assessment in 2022 was that IS-K was very dependent on the Salafi community for recruits. Even then, after the crackdown on Salafi madrasas of the previous months, the Taliban believed that some were still sending recruits to IS-K and planning to shut them down. While over 80% of the Afghan population follows the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, there is a small Salafi minority accounting for perhaps 2-3% of the population, mostly concentrated in eastern Afghanistan. Afghan Salafism is characterised by a much stricter textualist approach. All sources confirmed that by 2020 there were few Hanafis in IS-K in Nangarhar. In Kunar, the preponderance of Salafis was even greater. A former IS-K member of almost five years, who travelled around Kunar and Nuristan, says he never saw any non-Salafi members. As far as the north and the west are concerned, IS-K sources claimed a mixed membership in early 2023. One IS-K source said that while the majority of the members in Badakhshan were Salafis, Hanafis were the majority in the north, especially Jowzjan and Faryab. While this may well be true, there were few IS-K members in either Jowzjan or Faryab at that time. The IS-K leadership was aware that the strongly Salafi characterisation of IS-K was becoming a major issue and already in spring 2021 it decided to shift away from the recent years’ focus on recruiting Salafis and toward recruiting more Hanafi members. In reality, even in spring 2023 IS-K seemed to have limited hopes that large numbers of Hanafis would join. As an IS-K cadre acknowledged as late as April 2023: “Our priority is to recruit fighters from, and train them in, Kunar, Badakhshan, Kunduz and Nuristan”; that is, all provinces either with a largely Salafi population (Kunar and Nuristan), or with significant Salafi pockets (Badakhshan and, to a lesser extent, Kunduz).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part because of its lack of strong roots in almost all the north and north-east — the only major exception being some parts of Badakhshan — the move north implied moving even deeper underground for IS-K than was the case in the east, with most cells being completely isolated from society and from each other. This inevitably created command and control issues, which IS-K sought to manage with command decentralisation. A new structure was adopted, featuring three different centres of operations, each with full operational autonomy. As of April 2023, these main centres of operation were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kunar — responsible for eastern Afghanistan but also supporting operations in Kabul, sending in attack teams. The leadership of this operational centre was largely composed of Central Asians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kabul — a “special military commission” responsible to operations in the capital.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Badakhshan — responsible for operations in the north and north-east.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second measure, to cope with command-and-control issues, was an even greater reliance on educated and ideologised cadres and members. The importance of ideologised cadres was stressed by a commander as key to keeping morale high:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IS-K always focused on recruitment of highly aware (Hoshyar) fighters from Sharia faculties and universities. Students who study Sharia in Afghanistan’s universities are mostly aware of Islam and they are very good in preaching and spreading Islam and teaching the rules applying to Mujahidin and the value of Jihad to the other fighters. They can improve the morale of other. This is why IS-K is focusing on Afghan universities to recruit students of the Sharia faculty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for decentralisation was all the stronger due to the need to protect the leadership. Having suffered heavy leadership losses since its inception, IS-K invested in securing its internal communications, designed to survive interception by the Americans. IS-K sources claimed these were quite advanced by April 2023. According to one source, “Dr. Shahab [al Muhajir, the governor of Khorasan] has his own technology team that manages communications between him and other members of the group”. Clearly, however, internal communications have been increasing in complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move underground also complicated recruitment and training. It is revealing that IS-K began experimenting with online learning for its members. In February 2023, a new Telegram channel was established to provide basic military training. The channel was called Funun-e-Nezami (Military Skills), and its members posted pictures of weapons alongside descriptions of the ways in which they can be used, including a range of guns and IEDs. Another IS-K channel dedicated to online military training was (Commandos of Caliphate), which was irregularly active. The option of training all members in person within proper camps was no longer available. The al-Afraad al-Arqam channel instead warned to avoid compromising mobile numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly evident is IS-K’s growing reliance on online propaganda, especially via social media. A mapping of IS-K activities on social media by the Centre for Information Resilience identified thirty Facebook groups run by either the group or its supporters, used for recruitment purposes. In addition, IS-K activists were also seen using at least twenty-four student, Salafi and Islamic interest groups on Facebook for spreading their propaganda. Typical themes found on these pages included complaints about the policies of the Taliban’s Emirate, such as the lack of religious freedom for Salafis under the Taliban and the perceived tolerance of the Taliban towards other religious sects in Afghanistan: Shi’as, Sikhs, and Hindus. A common propaganda topic in 2022-3 has been the Taliban’s relations with foreign governments unpopular with Islamic extremists: the US, Russia, China, Iran, and Pakistan, as well as with the EU and the UN. IS-K propaganda has also very obviously tried to exploit intra-ethnic tensions to its advantage, alleging that land conflict in the north-west is driving Uzbek Taliban to quit the organisation. However, IS-K propaganda also features more subjective claims, such as what they describe as the un-Islamic character of Taliban governance. Other claims are far-fetched, such as calling the Taliban “servants of the Pakistani ISI” (see below on Taliban-Pakistan relations) and accused of having been corrupted by the Americans; IS-K falsely claimed that the Taliban agreed in Doha to implement an American-designed democratic system in Afghanistan to protect pagans like Hindus, Shi’as, and Sufis. Even when claims have some grounds in reality, IS-K propaganda strongly manipulate them; for example claiming that the Taliban obeyed the “orders” of the UN. The same propaganda video featured a clip of Donald Trump saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I met with Taliban leaders; they promised me that they will fight against all terrorist groups and bad people in Afghanistan including ISKP, and that they would be our men who fight against terrorism and the ISKP mujahideen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K propaganda also makes good use of alarmist claims made by international governments and media concerning their capabilities and power. In the aforementioned video, for example, feature several speeches of leaders of Central Asia Republics, in which they speak of the threat to their countries from ISKP, of their concern that the strength of ISKP has grown to 6,500 fighters and of the presence of these fighters in northern Afghanistan which has long borders with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key dimension of IS-K propaganda has been portraying itself as the creator and administrator of a utopian society. In March 2023 a new IS-K Telegram channel in Pashto and Dari dedicated to this strand of propaganda activities appeared, called Daastaan-e-Shab (Story of the Night), through which it shared accounts of its recruited members every Friday night. Every member was shown as being kind and hospitable, and as having sensitive aspects to his personality — as opposed to simply being bloodthirsty militants. The target of this propaganda seemingly was to inspire members of the Salafi community who are not already members of IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K’s social media effort eventually started running afoul of Taliban counterterrorism. It also ran into issues with Telegram, where many pro-IS-K accounts were banned in May 2023. IS-K in response started sharing with its members via its remaining Telegram channels standard OSINT best practices, which highlights the group’s sophistication with respect to social media. Users were being advised to flesh out their accounts by adding profile pictures to them, and to follow non-ISKP channels which cover topics as diverse as fashion to avoid drawing suspicion of being linked to a proscribed group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from going underground, decentralising and investing in an expanded social media campaign, IS-K also tried to undermine the Taliban’s reconciliation and reintegration efforts, bringing pressure on the elders to not facilitate negotiations between IS-K members and Taliban. One surrendering member heard from villagers that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daesh is trying a lot to undermine this process. Several elders who were secretly facilitating the negotiations and connecting IS-K members with the Taliban for their surrender have been threatened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others who surrendered confirmed the same, adding that threats consisted of death warnings and of burning homes down. IS-K also increased counter-intelligence efforts among its own ranks. These countermeasures were deemed to be effective former IS-K members, as they were under the impression that surrenders had either diminished in numbers or even ceased. A few surrendered IS-K members reportedly re-joined IS-K in Nangarhar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, IS-K invested considerable efforts trying to re-launch its campaign against the Emirate. These efforts appear to have reduced the impact of the Taliban’s counter-IS-K campaign. They did not, however, completely reverse the negative trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-k-on-the-brink-spring-2023&quot;&gt;IS-K on the Brink: Spring 2023&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, as discussed above, IS-K sought hard to adapt to the challenges posed by the Taliban, by spring 2023 it was in a very serious predicament. In part this was the result of the cumulative impact of counter-IS-K efforts by the Taliban. Despite keeping its overall level of activity low and limiting casualties, successful Taliban raids against IS-K cells in the cities appear to have made a dent on IS-K morale. While the actual number of killed in action, relative to the total strength of IS-K, might have been as low as four percent per year according to an internal source, these were mostly selected core members of urban cells. Although the total number of these core members is not known, the total size of the IS-K structure in the cities was certainly less than 1,000, with operational cells perhaps a third of that number and the rest being support elements. Hence, the casualty rate among these elite operational cells was certainly high. A senior source in IS-K acknowledged not just that the Taliban had busted several IS-K cells, but also that many safe houses had been seized, at great cost for the organisation. Moreover, IS-K sources might well understate the level of their casualties, either knowingly or because of being themselves fed disinformation by their leaders. At the end of May 2023, a source in Kunar, who was in regular contact with IS-K members, stated that he was hearing them complaining about being hit by the Taliban all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to understand that keeping clashes with the Taliban at a minimum was not without side effects. It was hardly a morale raiser for an insurgent organisation. There are indeed signs that the collapse of IS-K military activities was deepening IS-K’s morale crisis in spring 2023. The accelerating withdrawal into Pakistan was also bound to affect morale. IS-K propaganda tried to present the transfer of members to Pakistan as a demonstration of tactical skills, but as more and more members ended up in Pakistan, in many cases even dragging family members with them, the transfer must have been started looking more and more like a rout. An IS-K source indicated in April 2023 that almost two thirds of IS-K’s members were in Pakistan. Multiple sources within the TTP signalled an intensified presence of IS-K members in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan in spring 2023, not only in the traditional IS-K hideout of Tirah valley, but also in Orakzai, Bajaur and even in Peshawar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There deeper cause of the crisis was the worsening financial crisis, affecting IS-K in early 2023. Local elders in Kunar, in regular contact with the families of IS-K members, and sometimes with the members themselves, indicated that salaries to IS-K fighters — between $300 and $500 per month — had not been paid for months. While there were no reports of IS-K fighters forcing villagers to feed them, villagers were known to have started sending food to IS-K fighters hiding in the mountains. At the end of May 2023, a source in Kunar, who was in regular contact with IS-K members, stated that he was hearing them complaining about funds shortages. IS-K members reported to him having to asking for food in the villages; something never before reported. The elders also confirmed that IS-K had started collecting Zakat for the first time and “bring[ing] pressure on specific shopkeepers, businessmen and other rich people in the districts and in Asadabad city to pay for them. People are forced to pay them…”. Extortion from local businesses in Salafi communities was something new for IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, the crisis was the result of the Taliban getting better at making it harder for IS-K to transfer money into Afghanistan via the hawala system. Already in September 2022, an IS-K source acknowledged that just three hawala traders in all of Afghanistan were willing to do transfers for IS-K. Hawala traders reported intensifying Taliban controls, with the enforcement of rules dictating the registration of personal details, including IDs, for each transaction. The traders reported their feeling that while in the past some Hawala traders were ready to take some risk and accept transfers of large sums by dubious individuals without registering the transactions, by spring 2023 the risk was becoming too high. The situation was compounded by the fact that the Turkish authorities in November 2022 cracked down on the main IS-K financial hub, leading to the detention of twenty cadres who were used to transfer money via the hawala system. Although IS-K was able to partially replace the lost capabilities, some damage was permanent. At the end of May 2023, a source in Kunar, who was in regular contact with IS-K members, received hints that receiving hawala transfers from abroad was no longer possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial issues faced by IS-K were not entirely of the Taliban’s making, however. For years IS-K had been experiencing some unreliability from the IS central leadership regarding financial commitments. For example, in 2021 the central leadership only delivered half of the funds originally allocated. In 2022, the level of funding remained relatively modest, but promises of a big increase in funding for 2023 were made. The first signs, at the time of writing, were that these promises were far from being met in 2023 either. Although assessing the wealth of Islamic State is always difficult, there were signs that in 2022-23 its fundraising effort was lagging; sources mentioned “on-going efforts”, such as visits to various Gulf countries, but little in terms of actual donations. In April 2023 a source in the IS finance commission for Iraq mentioned that orders had been issued to transfer stockpiles of cash from Iraq to Turkey. Presumably, IS Central too was low in new funds and forced to rely on its reserves to keep going. As for why the external funding to IS has slowed down, it is too complex a topic to be addressed in this paper; suffice to say, a source within the Iranian government indicated that, as part of the agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia of 10 March 2023, the Saudis committed to block any support accruing to IS from their country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional evidence points towards difficulties with funding from even potentially sympathetic donors: a senior source in IS-K revealingly commented that “Islamic donors pay every group according to the activities of that group; we invested lots of money for a long-term offensive against our enemies”. He further explained that “IS-K in the past two years have invested lots of money in transferring members from one province of Afghanistan to another and from one region to another and also spent money on building and renting houses in different provinces of Afghanistan, buying weapons and other expenses”, but then the Taliban’s crackdown hit hard. The same source confirmed that in recent months IS-K faced “some financial problem” and that IS-K had to ask sympathisers in Afghanistan and Pakistan to help with cash donations and pay taxes like Zakat for the first time, as mentioned above by the elders of Kunar. He also implicitly admitted that IS-K members might be relying on food donations from sympathisers and relatives, whereas in the past IS-K had proudly stated the ability of its logistics to feed its fighters without having to rely on the villagers. He claimed that the leaderships of IS-K and IS was working to fix the problem with “Islamic governments and Salafi charities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s counter-IS-K operations and IS-K’s financial issues both contributed to forcing the group to slow down operations, according to the senior source mentioned above. The difficult financial and military situation has also led to the re-emergence of internal fissures. A local source in Kunar, well connected with IS-K members, said that his contacts revealed tensions and struggles within the leadership about the negative trend, with talks of yet another strategy being in the works and rumours of changes at the leadership level. The same senior source already mentioned a problem of “weak leadership of some people” and the “betrayal” of others, who reported about several cells and hideouts to the Taliban. He acknowledged that “there were some internal tensions”, but quickly added that they had been resolved by June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-ks-hopes-for-recovery-summer-2023&quot;&gt;IS-K’s Hopes for Recovery: Summer 2023&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have seen above, the spring crisis had complex and converging causes, some of which were upstream in the IS-K funding system. Given that funding was obviously key to IS-K’s viability, the organisation moved quickly to seek solutions. IS-K tried hard to figure out how to transfer some cash to Afghanistan, without going through the Afghan hawala sector; cross-border trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan as a covert way to transfer money to its forces within the latter. In June, one courier was caught with a lot of cash, just after crossing from Pakistan, according to local sources. Another technique for transferring money adopted by IS-K in the summer was sending goods (such as oil) into Afghanistan from both Pakistan and Central Asia as if they were being traded. IS-K members would then sell them on the market and keep the entire amount. Cryptocurrencies also appear to have become one of IS-K’s favourite ways of moving money. IS-K magazine Voice of Khurasan called for donations in cryptocurrency via Monero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K also sought to increase local revenue, for example by cooperating with kidnappers’ gangs for ransom. Extortion of money from wealthy individuals in eastern Afghanistan continued. However, given the lack of territorial control, as one IS-K source acknowledged in August 2023, tax collection did not amount to much compared to the amount IS-K had been able to obtain in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, by the summer of 2023, the financial situation was improving somewhat, at least in part because of the counter-measures discussed above. By October 2023, demands for food had completely stopped. Some IS-K members, who had been taking small loans (10,000-15,000 Afs) to feed their teams in Spring, were talking of returning the loans thanks to the improved financial situation. The financial recovery of IS-K should not be overstated, however: as one source noted, the payment of salaries was still suspended. One IS-K source in Kunar commented in October that “We have managed to restore capability and regain the trust of our financial partners and are faring much better than we were some months ago”. He then added that “If we compare the Islamic State’s current financial situation to what it was two years ago when the Americans surrendered in Afghanistan to the apostate Taliban, it can be said that we still have financial problems. However, compared to how things were six months ago, we are much better now….” The feeling was that IS-K had recovered from the nadir reached in the spring when it could not even feed its fighters, but was still far from having reached even the funding levels of late 2021-early 2022. Indeed extortion from local businessmen, a recent innovation, continued. Neither IS-K combat strength returned to the level of 2021. Under the new conditions, IS-K had to rely in Afghanistan largely on Afghan members, whereas in the past of its combat force was made up of Pakistanis. One IS-K source estimated in October 2023 that “around 80%” of IS-K’s fighters were Afghans, the rest being mainly from Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports also started emerging that recruitment in Kunar restarted, including in some Salafi madrasas. There were also reports of IS-K beginning to invest again in rebuilding its urban networks. A weapons smuggler in Kunar, with whom IS-K had accumulated a debt due to its insolvency in spring, indicated in August that IS-K had just paid cash to him for a weapons shipment. By October, IS-K guerrilla activities in Kunar reached the apparent rate of an attack every few days, causing limited casualties to the Taliban — one to two killed per attack even according to IS-K’s own claims on social media. As IS-K members flowed back into Kunar, they also started establishing more underground structures, such as training centres in areas of difficult access. The Taliban were forced to increase patrols again. In Afghanistan as a whole, throughout June - August 2023 there was an upsurge in IS-K attacks from April and May, when no attacks took place (Graph 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the summer of 2023 onwards, IS-K also resumed dispatching cells to previously unaffected northern cities, such as Pul-i Khumri, where on 13 October 2023 it was able to bomb a Shi’a Mosque, killing seven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K continued to adapt its propaganda to the new strategic environment. The more it had to reduce the scale of its violent activities, the more IS-K maintained an aggressive attitude, constantly threatening attacks against the Taliban and the West, to the point that the discrepancy with reality became more and more noticeable even on pro-IS-K social media. IS-K also began extending the threats to Sunni clerics. In October 2023 pro-IS-K media outlet al-Mursalat started threatening Afghan ulema into not complying with the Taliban’s demands to condemn IS-K in their sermons. During the summer of 2023, IS-K media intensified propaganda efforts aimed at the ethnic minorities, with a special focus on Panjshiris — still believed to be supportive of other opposition groups, such as the National Resistance Front — warning them that the western countries would not help them and pointing out how the old leaders betrayed them. Despite rising Taliban-Shi’a tension in the summer, IS-K propaganda continued accusing the Taliban of protecting the Shi’a community and reproduced videos of members of the Taliban security forces proudly stating their duty of protecting the Shi’as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more importantly, IS-K also began utilising social media for purposes other than propaganda. Online IS-K chats highlighted in September 2023 how recent online recruits in areas remote from IS-K bases are cut off and unable to participate in activities for now. In one such chat, Ghamgin-o-Gharibam, the following exchange took place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chat member: “While we cannot migrate to Caliphate areas because we lack territory in Khurasan, how can we attack our enemy? We also don’t have weapons.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Admin response: “Very soon the way for emigrating to the Caliphate ground will be opened.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chat member: “By when? Our friends are being arrested daily and we also fear being detained.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The admin agreed to teach basic military methods and promised that it would commence training with a lesson called “How to Carry Out a Guerrilla Attack Against Enemies in Cities”. IS-K was discouraging new members from travelling to its concentration areas, presumably for security reasons. Hence, one of the intentions behind investment in propaganda was to boost the morale of increasingly dispersed members and to convince them that the jihad was succeeding. IS-K tried to diminish the Taliban’s achievements and to stimulate revenge among IS-K members, for example claiming that the Taliban had deliberately killed IS-K family members during their raids against city cells. It is noteworthy that IS-K media channels would seek to reassure members about the prospect of being detained by the Taliban, with promises of freeing all detainees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While IS-K was somewhat energised by the relative improvement of its financial streams, even in the summer of 2023 it seemed to be struggling to identify a viable strategy and was instead focusing on trying to maintain its core structure, while the lower ranks shrank, waiting for the Taliban to make mistakes. One IS-K source in Kunar noted that in the summer of 2023 the “new” strategy adopted by the leadership of IS-K consisted of: hit and run attacks; attacks on IS-K defectors; attacks on Taliban leaders and commander; and attacks on Taliban Imams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy is not new, and repeats what IS-K has been doing since August 2021: keeping its core structure as safe as possible, while waiting for opportunities. From time to time, some developments do play in IS-K’s favour, at least temporarily. Repeated efforts to infiltrate the Taliban occasionally bear fruit, thanks to the growing frustration of ethnic minority Taliban with their Pashtun leaders and persistent general ethnic tension in the north. According to an elder previously connected to the Public Uprising Forces — a militia sponsored by the intelligence services of the previous regime — IS-K is indeed targeting former militiamen for recruitment, at least in northern Takhar. The source himself sounded quite sympathetic to IS-K and may have joined its membership. These recruits seem motivated largely by the desire of obtaining protection against the Taliban, as well as a thirst for revenge. As far as disgruntled Taliban are concerned, in October 2023 the Taliban detained four of their commanders, all Tajiks, in north-eastern Afghanistan, on accusation of having links to IS-K. Local Taliban sources reported that among the Tajik Taliban of the north-east there is widespread dissatisfaction at what they describe as their marginalisation by Pashtuns within the organisation. IS-K is aware of these tensions and proactively courts Tajiks commanders, some of whom are believed to be cooperating with it smuggling weapons and other logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K also positioned itself to exploit worsening Kabul-Islamabad relations; its attacks in Pakistan during 2022-23 could be interpreted as an attempt to put pressure on Islamabad, perhaps with a “support vs immunity from IS-K terrorism” trade-off in mind. Such deals were reported in the past, and the Taliban claim that they are still in place today, though they appear to have long fallen off. The Pakistani authorities bear grudges concerning the Emirate giving hospitality to the Tehrik Taliban Pakistan (TTP), so the concept is not far-fetched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this strategy were the case, then, IS-K has so far failed, possibly because at the same time it was also courting the TTP — the biggest insurgent group opposed to the Pakistani government. These efforts appeared to have a more realistic chance of success, due to the Taliban’s effort to restrain foreign jihadists based on their territory. While the TTP was able to resist such efforts better than other groups, serious friction with the Taliban occurred. Tension peaked after the Chitral fighting (September 2023), when the Taliban detained tens of TTP members who were on their way back to Afghanistan, prompting more anger and resulting in high level TTP-Taliban talks to defuse tension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taliban leaders sought repeatedly to convince the TTP to avoid carrying out raids into Pakistan from Afghan territory and avoid recruiting Afghans into its ranks. Ultimately, however, the Taliban refused to crack down on TTP activities as demanded by Islamabad, fearful that IS-K accusations of betraying the cause of jihad in Pakistan gain credibility. The Taliban fear that the TTP, which has thousands of armed men inside Afghanistan, might see large scale defections to IS-K, or even ally with it. There is evidence of some cooperation between IS-K and TTP from Spring 2023 onwards. Reportedly, TTP leaders had for several months been constantly alluding to the possibility of “defections” to IS-K from their ranks, whenever the Afghan Taliban put them under pressure. The Taliban’s leadership, aware of widespread sympathies for the TTP within its ranks, for all of 2022 and 2023 prioritised relations with the TTP over relations with Islamabad, resulting in gradually worsening Afghanistan-Pakistan relations: in November 2023, Pakistan expelled Afghans illegally residing on Pakistani soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the major difficulties it faced after the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, IS-K demonstrated great resilience. Its strategic choices were often based on over-optimistic assessment of the weaknesses of the Taliban and the rigid ideological approach of the organisation greatly limited its ability to expand its ranks. However, the tactical choices made by the leadership were mostly sound from the perspective of a violent extremist organisation: it rapidly bailed out of direct confrontation with the Taliban, even in the east where it had its main stronghold; it went on the offensive in the cities; it sought to spare its forces; it invested massively in its propaganda operations, which helped it convey an image of much greater strength than it actually had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical flaw of IS-K was that it remained crucially dependent on funding accruing from abroad. Not only did the Taliban get gradually better at interdicting the flow of money but IS-K also struggled to provide a compelling rationale for prospective donors to fund it. The idea of a jihad against the Taliban had little appeal among traditional sympathisers and supporters of IS-K in the Gulf countries and IS-K struggled to offer an alternative and convincing rationale. Eventually, even the central leadership of IS, which had made up for IS-K’s failure to raise enough of its own funds, seemed to have started running out of cash. Even if in the latter half of 2023 the situation was easing somewhat, this remained a critical vulnerability for IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being undermined by the gradually reducing flow of money and having to decentralise its operations, IS-K was able to maintain a considerable level of organisational coherence, helped by the Taliban’s failure to offer attractive packages to disillusioned members. Moving IS-K members to Pakistan was likely part of a wider strategy meant to put a large part of its structure in “reserve” or “freeze” mode, in the hope of new funding accruing soon. Indeed, as soon as some money started flowing again, many of these re-entered Afghanistan, but parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan remain available to IS-K as safe havens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen how long this organisational coherence will last if funding cannot be kept at sufficient levels. Maintaining a large structure underground is expensive and makes recruitment harder to carry on. As importantly, the low level of activity and relative passivity in the face of Taliban crackdowns should be expected to affect morale. Given that the prospects for IS central to enjoy a renaissance looked rather dim as of mid-2023, IS-K’s best chances of reversing a negative trend are if intra-Taliban divisions deepen, resulting in the implosion of the Emirate — of which there is little visible sign — or some regional power deciding to support it against the Taliban for its own reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much, of course, will also depend on how the Taliban will develop their counter-IS-K efforts. This paper shows how IS-K’s original challenge to the Emirate had to repeatedly adapt to the Taliban’s own evolving response. Overall, IS-K’s flexibility, its capacity to adapt, and even to migrate geographically is striking. If there were any doubt that IS-K has absorbed organisational know-how from the original Islamic State, it should have been dispelled by post-August 2021 developments. IS-K clearly seems to have inherited the resilience of the mother organisation. It is worth noting that IS-K has clearly been prioritising maintaining its core structure of highly motivated and well-prepared cadres, even at the price of sacrificing its foot soldiers. That core structure is the repository of the know-how inherited from IS-Central or developed by IS-K itself throughout its history. That the core has shown the ability to develop new tactics and ability to function as a relatively large underground organisation represents the greatest threat. IS-K might eventually survive the Taliban’s onslaught, but if it does it will emerge as a much more dangerous organisation than before.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;林榮基赴台擺頭版 陳沛敏：係我嘅決定，因有新聞價值、持獨家照片者要求&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cTaUc9i.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（5日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第23日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。庭上展示黎智英與陳沛敏之間的訊息紀錄，黎指示陳：「請繼續做在大陸做生意的香港商人面對的危險，嚇壞那些生意佬讓建制派不敢造次。」控方指其後文章〈西環集中營：集結商界 專業人士7.1上街〉提及商界反對修例，陳則表示不肯定文章內容如此寫，是否因為黎的指示，還是純屬巧合。另外，《蘋果》於2019年4月頭版報導林榮基修例前赴台，陳稱：「係我嘅決定」，因她認為有新聞價值，加上持有相關獨家照片的人士開出條件，若果《蘋果》打算頭條報導，才會願意提供相片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英邀香港監察羅傑斯聯絡陳-陳沛敏反送中後傳送新聞稿較頻密&quot;&gt;黎智英邀「香港監察」羅傑斯聯絡陳 陳沛敏：反送中後傳送新聞稿較頻密&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第二天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示訊息紀錄，黎智英於2017年10月向陳沛敏發送訊息，稱「沛敏，我剛同Ben Rogers晚飯，他剛與一些MP成立了HK WATCH維護香港自由，我對他說有需要傳媒的幫忙請他找你並給了他你的聯絡，謝謝。黎」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示對羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）認識不多，只知道他與一些英國國會議員成立了「香港監察」。黎傳送上述訊息之後，羅傑斯的確有聯絡她，傳送一些傳媒新聞稿，開頭僅是一些介紹「香港監察」的資料，但到了2019年《逃犯條例》引起社會運動，羅傑斯傳送新聞稿的頻率「係密咗、多啲就香港事務出新聞稿囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;1/2 Tomorrow I will begin a 24 hour fast &amp;amp; hunger strike for Hong Kong. I call it a fast &amp;amp; a hunger strike because they have two meanings. A fast is spiritual &amp;amp; includes prayer. A hunger strike is political &amp;amp; involves protest. #HongKong #StandwithHK #democracyforhongkong pic.twitter.com/1pLvwgiCAf — Benedict Rogers 羅傑斯 (@benedictrogers) November 15, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，陳確認羅傑斯是「香港監察」的信託主席，相信《蘋果日報》曾經報導過「香港監察」成立，以及羅傑斯被香港政府當局拒絕入境。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏形容香港監察對中國帶批判性&quot;&gt;陳沛敏形容「香港監察」對中國帶批判性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2018年5月16日，羅傑斯傳送了一篇文章給黎智英，之後黎轉發該訊息給陳沛敏。文章題為〈香港政府發動的政治檢控壓毀民主派的希望（“Lawfare Waged by the Hong Kong Government is Crushing the Hopes of Democrats”）〉，由羅傑斯撰寫，於2018年5月15日刊登。陳沛敏閱讀後，指文章提及DQ立法會議員、檢控佔中運動中的某些議員，惟她不肯定《蘋果》有否報導此文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，「香港監察」可說是支持中國，還是反中國？陳回答：「我諗佢好 critical 囉」，意指對中國帶有批判性，同樣形容亦適用於羅傑斯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指示做大美總領事演說-陳沛敏此前經已報導&quot;&gt;黎智英指示「做大」美總領事演說 陳沛敏：此前經已報導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年3月4日，其時政府已推出了《逃犯條例》修訂，黎智英向陳沛敏傳送一篇《華盛頓郵報》報導，指示她報導時任美國駐港澳總領事 Kurt Tong 於同年2月27日的公開演說，黎並說「請做大」。陳之後回覆，已用A2全版報導，而「明天見報會繼續」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏指，A2僅次於頭版，因此A2全版報導算是「幾大」。控方問黎此前曾否要求她「做大」某些新聞，陳稱：「應該有。」但黎並沒有解釋為何想她「做大」該新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳其後解釋，其實在黎傳送上述訊息之前，《蘋果》已經用了A2全版來報導演說，可能黎當時並未留意，所以其後黎發覺後，才會有一則訊息指「好的，對不起，我不知道，謝謝」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑陳毫不猶豫地遵從黎要求&quot;&gt;官質疑陳毫不猶豫地遵從黎要求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，該演說在早前發生，不再是新聞，而是一則舊聞，可是陳卻似乎毫不猶豫地遵從黎的要求，而不是告訴黎「這是舊聞」或「沒有需要放在A2」，還是因為陳覺得值得放在A2？陳則澄清，她的意思是，當黎叫她「做大」美領事演說時，「其實我哋已經做大咗喇」，因《蘋果》在演說翌日便已全版報導。而她當時回覆的訊息只是「婉轉地話畀佢（黎）我哋已經做大咗」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問，但陳並沒有拒絕黎的要求，而她剛才供稱「應該有」遵從黎的指示。陳則表示，既然黎如此重視這新聞，而且《蘋果》已經報導了，「但都會睇吓會有咩跟進報導囉。譬如輿論有冇對個演說有新回應，而唔係重覆再報導多一次個演說」，所以她回覆黎表示會跟進報導，而不是明言拒絕他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問，不論黎重視或不重視某些新聞，是否都會影響《蘋果》的編採方向。陳回答：「都會嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎指示報導陳太與彭斯會面-做到最大效果-陳沛敏有新聞價值&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎指示報導陳太與彭斯會面 「做到最大效果」 陳沛敏：有新聞價值&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示 WhatsApp 訊息，黎智英向陳沛敏轉發一張照片，是前政務司司長陳方安生與時任美國副總統彭斯會面時握手的照片，黎指這是「大新聞（big news）」，指示陳將新聞「做到最大效果（use it to the maximum effect）」。陳確認其後有將新聞做到「最大效果」，即是將報聞「擺喺顯著位置，篇幅大啲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示《蘋果日報》於2019年3月24日的頭版報導，標題為〈彭斯晤陳太 關注港人權〉，頭版下方有一篇配稿題為「主導對華政策」、「港問題或成中美角力戰」。控方問這是否陳當時對中美關係的理解，陳回答是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又提及，頭版照片下方標註是由公民黨提供，而且報導提及有其他公民黨成員陪同陳方安生訪美。控方另指，根據訊息紀錄，黎智英轉發給陳的訊息，是來自前公民黨立法會議員郭榮鏗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳為何要將此新聞放在頭版，陳表示：「都覺得佢係有新聞價值。當然黎生話要做大，都係一個因素嚟嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎曾希望約見記協執委-惟記協內部有不同意見-最後沒有成事&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎曾希望約見記協執委 惟記協內部有不同意見 最後沒有成事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2019年3月29日及30日的訊息均有提及香港記協，陳沛敏起初表示不記得是什麼事件，但閱過訊息紀錄後，憶述當時黎智英希望約見記協執委，相信他有意談論《逃犯條例》對新聞業的影響，於是想經她聯絡對方。惟記協執委則表示內部對於是否會面有不同意見，陳於是將相關回覆轉告黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;報導引述黎稱倘修例慘過23條-陳沛敏黎認為條例用作政治檢控&quot;&gt;報導引述黎稱倘修例「慘過23條」 陳沛敏：黎認為條例用作「政治檢控」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年4月1日《蘋果》報導，題為〈黎智英：倘修例傳媒冇得做〉，文中引述黎稱若果通過修例會「慘過23條」，又稱「呢單嘢好緊要㗎大佬，呢單嘢過咗，我哋冇得做㗎！傳媒冇得做㗎！你話報道大陸新聞，佢話你揭露國家機密；你批評佢，佢又話你顛覆國家安全，咁就冇㗎嘞，新聞自由依家少少都冇埋㗎喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，為何黎會將《基本法》23條與《逃犯條例》相提並論？陳指因為黎認為《逃犯條例》是用來「針對一啲政治檢控」、「政治檢控用途」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指示多報導商界對修例擔心-嚇壞那些生意佬讓建制派不敢造次&quot;&gt;黎智英指示多報導商界對修例擔心 「嚇壞那些生意佬讓建制派不敢造次」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年3月30日的訊息，黎向陳稱：「沛敏，今日頭條做得很好，只是沒有說做大陸新聞分分鐘被視為揭露國家機密，和批評中國政府文章會被標籤顛覆國家安全等罪名。但很好了。請繼續做在大陸做生意的香港商人面對的危險，嚇壞那些生意佬讓建制派不敢造次。謝謝。」陳回覆，稱「收到。商界有票，所以政府才稍微讓步，如果他們反對，政府就沒戲唱了」。黎回覆：「對，對付這些怕死鬼可能是我們絕招。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏指，黎認為他們「要報導多啲商界對《逃犯條例》的擔心，或者反對《逃犯條例》的意見」。法官李運騰問陳認為黎的訊息是「指示」、「建議」還是其他？陳認為是「指示」，因為黎並不是在提出建議，陳當時亦同意黎的指示。控方問到，黎口中的「怕死鬼」是哪些人，陳相信是指做生意的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後再傳來訊息：「沛敏，你今日的文章畫龍點睛，寫得真好。」陳在庭上表示，她有替副刊專欄撰寫文章，每隔一個星期六刊登一篇，專欄名為「堆填生活」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎落指示後文章出現相關內容-陳不肯定有否因果關係&quot;&gt;黎落指示後文章出現相關內容 陳：不肯定有否因果關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年4月3日的《蘋果日報》文章，題為〈西環集中營：集結商界 專業人士7.1上街〉。陳沛敏解釋，此專欄主要是寫政界花邊，多數由政治組同事執筆，雖然每次撰寫的同事可能不同，但是均會使用同一筆名「季陶」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指文章提及「有民主派人士稱，現時各個界別反修訂《逃犯條例》的人已越來越多，特別是商界及專業界，但礙於怕北京及林鄭政府秋後算賬，大多不敢公開表態，他們正研究如何集結這些力量」。控方問，上述提及商界的內容與黎早前的指示有沒有關係？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳則表示不肯定，因為她有跟同事轉達要做多些關於商界擔心的報導，但上述文章是否因為黎下達指示，然後剛巧有一位民主派說商界和專業界擔心，而哪一件事導致同事寫這篇文章，她就沒有查問下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問，所以陳是不肯定當中的因果關係？陳回答是。法官杜麗冰又問陳知不知道文章由誰撰寫，陳表示只知道是政治組同事寫，但不知道是哪一位同事。杜官問，所以陳不知道文章內容如此寫是因為黎的指示，還是巧合？陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英曾建議訪問司法界前輩-惟因聯絡不到而告吹&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英曾建議訪問「司法界前輩」 惟因聯絡不到而告吹&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示訊息紀錄，黎智英轉發來自民主黨李永達的訊息，並稱「以上是李永達提議」。李的訊息建議《蘋果》將修例其中幾個重點逐日分析，讓讀者逐點消化。陳相信當時《蘋果》有執行此建議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又在訊息中提及文章〈跟司法界前輩談引渡惡法〉寫得很好，問陳可否訪問文中提及的「司法界前輩」。陳理解這是一項「建議」，因為黎的訊息有問「係咪可以？」，所以陳認為：「佢都唔肯定係咪可以做到，但建議我哋諗吓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，其後她在公司與黎親身討論，黎重申覺得該專欄文章內容寫得很好，籲陳考慮寫成報導及怎樣表達重點，又問可否找到文中提及的「司法界前輩」，如果對方不肯露面，又能否要求只刊出背影。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳最終有否執行黎的建議。陳則稱當時應該聯絡不到受訪者，因為他們希望經文章作者聯絡「司法界前輩」，惟後來沒有回音。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏稱林榮基赴台新聞做頭條乃其決定-因有新聞價值提供獨家照片人士要求&quot;&gt;陳沛敏稱林榮基赴台新聞做頭條乃其決定 因有新聞價值、提供獨家照片人士要求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年4月26日的訊息紀錄，關於黎要求報導前銅鑼灣書店店長林榮基離港赴台。陳沛敏稱：「黎生喺清晨時 send 咗幾十個 message 畀我」，直到早上10至11時，她才醒來看到黎的訊息，於是聯絡羅偉光，並得悉《蘋果》網站版同事已經正在處理，以及下午3時準備在網站刊登林榮基的新聞。陳續指，她向黎交代之後，下午才上班，而結果林榮基的新聞成為翌日實體報紙的頭條。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，以林榮基作為頭條「係我嘅決定」，因為她認為本身有新聞價值，加上提供相關獨家照片的人士開出條件，「如果做A1（頭條），佢先畀（照片）我哋用。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又憶述，前《蘋果》社長張劍虹當時似乎「好緊張呢件事」，所以陳決定把林榮基的報導放在頭條。陳指當時張在台灣，相信他透過台灣《蘋果》同事的協助找林做訪問，「佢有去幫手寫埋、採訪埋，佢亦有同黎生講佢喺採訪途中。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏蘋果每天召開數個會議-決定報紙內容和頭條&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：《蘋果》每天召開數個會議 決定報紙內容和頭條&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，控方問及《蘋果日報》實體報紙的出版流程。陳供稱，她每天約2時半會出席「鋤報會」，同場有不同部組的主管，每人輪流發表對當日出版的報紙的意見，可以是關於新聞角度、圖片選擇、其他報紙有但《蘋果》沒有的新聞，或者就同一單新聞《蘋果》有什麼做得比其他報紙遜色。最後由陳沛敏和前執行總編輯林文宗作總結，會議歷時約半小時。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及陳沛敏與林文宗在職能上有何分別，陳指林可謂她的副手，正如她上周五提及，她身體狀況不容許她工作太長時間，所以林文宗負責「守到報紙出版最後時間」，而且她休假期間林會接手她的工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏續指，開完「鋤報會」之後，下午約3時會有「初會」，各部組會派代表出席，通常是採訪主任或各部組的副總編輯。會議中各部組會報告當天有什麼重要新聞、正準備什麼新聞角度、有何跟進工作等，之後他們會揀選一些能夠「做得大」的新聞放在頭版，而陳和林會提供意見，例如可以如何跟進。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，她在下午5時會參與「編前會議」，主要是跟進「初會」，包括揀選哪些新聞放在頭幾頁。不過，「編前會議」至報紙出版之間的一段時間，可能會有大新聞發生，或事件出現新進展，假設有一宗大新聞發生於晚上9時，需要更改新聞的編排位置，然則「我哋都會改過晒佢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到上述三種會議有否保存會議記錄，陳稱沒有，因當日工作結束之後，這些紀錄便沒有需要再保存。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏總編輯羅偉光不時出席會議&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：總編輯羅偉光不時出席會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問，有沒有高層出席上述會議。陳指《蘋果日報》總編輯羅偉光不時出席，大約每周數次，視乎有否重大新聞發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏續指，《蘋果日報》逢周三會有一個「Planning會」，除陳自己和林文宗之外，出席者包括港聞組、中國組、國際組和財經組等各部組，會上各部組會談及未來一星期有什麼重點新聞、、會著重什麼新聞角度及會怎樣部署，陳和林亦會提供意見，例如可以如何跟進。至於羅偉光，陳形容「因為佢真係好忙」，未能出席每次會議，因此即使他不在場，會議都會如期舉行。&lt;/p&gt;

Not long after, then-Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal was proclaiming “a Marine Corps for the next 500 years” in the wake of the U.S victory at Iwo Jima.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;This turnaround in fortunes was in no small part driven by reformers who recognized that retaining the underlying utility that amphibious forces provide in terms of both tactical and strategic mobility demanded changes to their underlying concepts of employment as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures. Underpinning this transformation was an effort to define role of amphibious forces as an enabling capability for the fleet itself rather than merely one that was enabled by the rest of the force.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s amphibious forces are at a similar inflection point when they will have to define their role in the future combat operating environment. These forces, which have traditionally represented a mechanism through which rapid reaction could be delivered on both Europe’s own maritime flanks and at reach, will be presented with two challenges. At sea, the challenge of anti-access/area denial capabilities will hold the shipping that supports amphibious forces at risk. On land, organizations such as the British 3 Commando Brigade and the Dutch Korps Mariniers will have their ability to concentrate for tactical effect contested by adversary militaries organized to deliver large volumes of fires on rapid cycles, cued in by unmanned aerial vehicles. As light forces without their own organic short-range air defense systems (beyond man-portable air defenses), European marines will face considerable challenges in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This need not, however, represent a basis for surrendering the tactical and operational opportunities that amphibious forces provide a joint force. In many respects, the contribution of forces that can exploit the entirety of the littoral as a maneuver space will be of ever greater importance if peer competitors such as Russia are to be denied the opportunity to operate as they would prefer to do on narrow linear fronts in theatres such as the Baltic and NATO’s northern flank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to deliver continued tactical and operational utility, forces such as the Royal Marines will have to resolve an underlying challenge. To survive they will, among other things, have to become an increasingly distributed force. However, distribution brings with it inherent challenges in terms of both sustaining a force and delivering meaningful effects on the battlefield. Of course, this dynamic is not unique to amphibious forces as distribution is becoming more important across the board. However, the question is how forces that are both distributed and inherently light can continue to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent report, my coauthor and I argue that European marine forces (including the Royal Marines) can deliver considerable utility if they subsume their concepts of operations within the traditional maritime functions of strike and securing sea control. Our premise is that there is a basis for closer alignment between marine organizations and fleets (in particular fleets traditionally optimized for sea denial in littoral spaces) as well as between emerging concepts of operations within marine organizations on both sides of the Atlantic. Recognizing this can help resolve the “dispersal dilemma” and can, moreover, allow marines to help resolve a growing spatial separation between fleets that operate at reach and joint forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both littoral-oriented fleets and evolving amphibious forces such as the U.S. Marine Corps can deliver capable strike capabilities — something that is as relevant to disruption inland from the littoral as it is to tasks such as sea denial in the Indo-Pacific. However, strike-centric operations need to be enabled by surveillance and reconnaissance inland, as well as by shaping operations that influence an opponent to behave in ways that maximize his vulnerability. It is here that European marine forces redesigned to operate as a distributed raiding capability can offer the greatest value. In effect, then, there is an inherent complementarity between light European marine forces, which must of necessity operate in a distributed manner, and strike-centric forces that can generate fires from the littoral. These forces would thus evolve into the forward edge of a single archipelagic capability encompassing fires distributed in the littoral and smaller coastal combatants. European marines employed in this way would become a critical enabler for any effort to deliver effects inland from the littoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;change-drivers-and-opportunities&quot;&gt;Change: Drivers and Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, European marine forces such as the Royal Marines and the Korps Mariniers were expected to provide a rapid reaction capability on Europe’s northern flank. Structured and equipped as light infantry, these forces would represent the vanguard element of an amphibious force that would include the U.S. Marine Corps. This force would, itself, be reinforced by the Norwegian army as the state mobilized based on its conscription system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, important elements of this vision would prove difficult to replicate. First, though a credible and dangerous sea denial challenge existed in the 1980s as well, the threat has evolved. The processing power to fuse data from multiple sensor types and from multiple sources has developed in tandem with the emergence of supersonic and hypersonic anti-ship cruise missiles such as the P-800 and the Zircon. The proliferation of different sensor types as well as the means to cue them will make hiding on the surface increasingly difficult, while faster missiles reduce the salvo sizes needed to penetrate an air defense screen. To be sure, Russia has struggled to engage dynamic targets in the conflict in Ukraine, but it should be assumed that it will improve in this regard. Similarly, a combination of more capable man-portable air defenses and longer-ranged air defense systems will challenge insertion using helicopters in many cases. All of this was in evidence in the early days of the conflict in Ukraine, when the reconnaissance elements of the Russian Black Sea Fleet’s 810th Naval Infantry Brigade encountered stiff resistance near Odessa when they attempted insertion by both sea and air. This does not mean that amphibious insertion is impossible, but it will occur under increasingly contested conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, lodgments ashore will become increasingly difficult to defend. This is not exactly a new issue and has been a challenge for amphibious forces historically. Examples such as the Falklands War illustrate how vulnerable a force that gradually builds up combat power ashore can be to air attack. However, the air and missile threat will become more complex for a number of reasons. First, increased precision means that tools such as short-range ballistic missiles can be used effectively as tactical tools. Secondly, armed and surveillance drones such as Russia’s Okhotnik and China’s GJ-11 can provide adversaries with a relatively simple means of generating very low observable air power. Third, opponents can generate large volumes of less-precise standoff by equipping dumb bombs with glide kits as the Russians have with the FAB-500. Finally, supporting assets will be occupied with tasks such as self-protection, the defense of carrier groups, and, in the case of aircraft, suppression of air defense — all of which means that external defensive counter-air cannot always be relied upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities&quot;&gt;Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons to believe that the ability to exploit the maneuverability of amphibious forces in the littoral can be both sustained and exploited to good effect. On the likely fronts where a Russian force might advance into Europe, Russia would enjoy the advantage of operating on narrow fronts where firepower, electronic warfare assets, and air defense systems can be concentrated to devastating effect. In Estonia, for example, NATO forces might face Russian forces on a front of roughly 50 kilometers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should Russia meet the targets that it has set itself under the aegis of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu’s planned force design, it will field a force of 1.5 million that includes 10 new divisions in two new military districts. Such a force would almost certainly be of variable quality, much like the current three-tiered Russian force structure in Ukraine (divided between disposable units, line infantry, and high-quality assault infantry). The force described would, however, generate considerable combat mass. A Russian force thus constituted could, for example, fix NATO forces on multiple points on the alliance’s frontier with Russia while concentrating its higher quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in the campaign for the Donbas in July 2022, when Russian forces are able to concentrate in this manner, they can generate fires on a scale and with a level of responsiveness that would impose considerable attrition on defenders (at one point, Ukrainian forces in the Donbas were losing 200 men a day). Narrow fronts allow a Russian force to saturate its line of advance with drones such as the Orlan-10, which can allow Russian forces to cue in fires in as little time as three minutes from initial observation. While ground- and air-based precision strike assets can disrupt the lines of communication and supply upon which such a Russian force depends, Russian forces have adapted to systems such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System and, moreover, would be able to concentrate a considerable portion of their surveillance and strike assets to detecting and destroying ground based systems in a congested theatre. As illustrated by Russia’s use of Iskander missiles to destroy individual Ukrainian surface-to-air missile systems, when Russian forces believe that a capability is sufficiently important they can devote disproportionately costly resources to engaging it. In Ukraine, the size of the frontline has complicated Russian efforts to responsively engage Western strike assets but this may be a simpler task on many of the fronts where Russian and NATO forces would be likely to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geometry of the battlefield can, however, be expanded considerably if the littoral is treated as a space from which inland strike can be generated. Estonia, for example, has 2,222 islands while Norway has, by some estimates, over 200,000. Strike platforms such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System and the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System, both of which will likely feature heavily in the U.S. Marine Corps’ future force design, can thus be considerably more survivable if they can operate both on continental main lands and offshore. While the utility of concepts such as Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations has largely been discussed in the context of the Indo-Pacific, the same concepts can enable an allied force to fight the deep battle more effectively in the European theatre by operating from a wider range of positions. Not only would this complicate the challenge of surveillance for Russian forces by expanding the area that must be surveyed severalfold, but it would also introduce a requirement for platform specialization and complicate the use of some intelligence and surveillance assets, since drones built to operate overland are less stable and survivable in the maritime domain due to climatic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a second opportunity in the European littoral, revolving around the existing surface fleets of new NATO members in theatres like the Baltic. Historically, nations such as Finland and Sweden built their navies for sea denial against what was presumed to be a superior Russian naval force in the Baltic Sea. While the continuing threat posed by the Russian navy in the Baltic should not be understated, it is nonetheless the case that this force will likely be heavily overmatched against NATO — meaning that the original function of sea denial that underpinned these fleets is no longer relevant. However, small missile-equipped platforms such as the Hamina-class fast attack craft and the Visby-class corvette, which are optimized to operate in shallow waters and equipped with dual use missiles such as the Swedish-made RGB-III, can just as easily form the core of a forward postured element of a NATO maritime component where their function would be delivering strikes inland from a narrow sea like the Baltic. The demand signal for such vessels from the wider force would be considerably less significant than for vessels like frigates and destroyers, which will also be required for blue water functions such as anti-submarine warfare and task group protection, and they would represent both smaller and less appealing targets for Russian shore-based sea denial systems than would larger, more expensive allied platforms. The navies of new allies could thus retain their littoral-oriented role in narrow seas but in a forward posture that would considerably complicate Russian planning on the maritime flanks of an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the operational level, the ability to posture strike platforms such as those envisioned within the U.S. Marine Corps’ Force Design 2030 in areas such as northern Norway during a crisis would also impose dilemmas on Russian theater-level planning. Such systems would pose a considerable threat to facilities such as Severomorsk and would necessarily need to be engaged. Yet resourcing an effort against them would likely strip Russia’s other fronts of critical assault units (primarily from the Airborne Forces and 200th Arctic Brigade) since the ability to execute cold weather operations is not held across the force. Moreover, such forces would have to advance on narrow fronts and difficult terrain where, if they cannot suppress allied forces by sheer weight of fire and surveillance saturation, they would prove highly vulnerable, much as the Russian army was in its initial assault on Kyiv. The posturing of strike platforms can thus enable operational dislocation and — if an opponent cannot easily track them — can reinforce deterrence. As an example of how an inability to track allied assets has contributed to deterrence in the past, we might consider NATO’s exercise Ocean Venture, which saw allied maritime platforms go emissions-dark in the High North, much to the consternation of Soviet planners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;european-maritime-forces&quot;&gt;European Maritime Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, this article has discussed European naval capabilities as well as systems likely to be held within the U.S. Marine Corps. Restructured European marine forces can add considerable value to the framework described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge for European marine forces is that they can no longer function as conventional light infantry brigades. However, they can provide a crucial offer to strike-capable partner forces, namely the capacity to both identify targets inland and to dislocate and fix adversary forces in ways that enable strike-centric components to be used to good effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, the Royal Marines envision restructuring the traditional commando company into 12-man strike teams. Such teams, if enabled to operate along the depth of an opponent’s frontage, can represent a considerable force multiplier for strike-centric partner forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to operate at depth can be enabled by the fact that the maritime maneuver space is effectively parallel to an opponent’s likely line of advance. If enabled by surface maneuver platforms with sufficient reach and low observability, this can enable the insertion of strike teams at depths that other force elements might not always be able to achieve. This would presume a shift in design philosophy, with surface maneuver craft and not surface connectors representing the force’s primary maneuver capability. The latter would require characteristics such as low observability, which necessarily comes at the expense of carrying capacity. Moreover, such platforms could be enabled with their own strike capabilities. We might consider, as an example, how Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps has equipped British-made Bladerunner speed boats with missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While observation in the littoral represents a considerable challenge, adversary sensor networks are inherently dependent on radar given the narrow fields of regard that other modes of detection such as electro-optical sensors allow. Efforts to beat radar through both low observability and the use of decoys and countermeasures to exacerbate the effect of climatic conditions such as super refraction (which generates false positives) can make an entire maritime network less effective. Sufficiently versatile vessels could also be equipped with Short Ranged Air Defense capabilities — something that China has emplaced on the 42-meter Type 022 catamaran. Notably, Sweden’s navy and marines appear to already be making this shift with planned surface maneuver vessels equipped with NEMO mortars. Fired from the littoral, such mortars can in principle be used against targets at depth (at least near coastal areas) because they can bypass an opposing army’s front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of a shift emphasizing surface maneuver would come in terms of both size and overall carrying capacity once requirements such as low observability are accounted for, making it necessary for marine forces to rely on light vehicles such as the Polaris MRZR. On the one hand, it might be argued that this introduces a gap between marines and land components as the latter’s equipment cannot be easily moved. While true at one level, this would also introduce complementarities in other areas. Marine forces thus equipped can, for example, as easily interoperate with units such as the British Army’s Deep Reconnaissance Strike Brigade as part of a whole-of-force effort to win the deep battle. Forces do not always have to be interoperable to be complementary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some evidence to suggest that distributed light raiding units operating at depth can be a considerable force multiplier. Russian doctrine presumes a ratio of 12 infantry to one when operating against special forces in rear areas, meaning that such forces can tie down assets of disproportionate value. The ability of Ukrainian infantry equipped with Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapons to tie down Russian armor to enable their destruction by artillery represents another example. Exercises such as Green Dagger reinforce this. In the context of Green Dagger, a force comprising 40 Commando and the Korps Mariniers operated ahead of 7th Marine Regiment against a U.S. Marine Corps opposing force. 40 Commando was divided up into 12-person strike teams that operated ahead of a light defensive screen. The presence of distributed raiding strike teams of marines posed considerable challenges to the opposing U.S. commander, who could not distribute his forces without raising the risk of raiding but was exposed to fires if he chose to concentrate to both better defend against raiding and to overrun a fairly light Royal Marine defensive screen. In effect, there is an inherent complementarity between distributed light forces and strike-centric ones including those in littoral spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former can operate at depths and in ways that enable the latter while the weight of fire that strike-centric forces at sea in the littoral can bring to bear allows distributed vanguard elements to generate effects without concentrating. Removing the requirement to concentrate in turn reduces the need for the build-up of capabilities that can support a conventionally structured brigade, which, as discussed, are inherently vulnerable. Moreover, distributed small teams have certain other advantages. They can deploy intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms with credible sensor payloads at short ranges, which is critical as large longer-ranged systems are inherently vulnerable. Moreover, smaller units can benefit from solutions such as multispectral concealment that are viable even in the current operating environment but do not scale due to the costs involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, things must change in order to stay the same. The utility of maneuver on and from the littoral remains an important part of the solution to the challenge of Russian combat power in Europe, much as it was during the Cold War. However, the methods by which effects such as operational dislocation and tactical disruption are achieved will need to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to generate long-range strike both from offshore islands and maritime platforms can help to resolve the challenge of generating concentrated effects with distributed forces. This has relevance both to the application of U.S. Marine Corps concepts of operations in the European theatre but also for how littoral-oriented European coastal fleets might be used in a NATO context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European marine forces will to a great extent need to frame their future utility in relation to these trends. They have considerable opportunities to add value to strike-centric concepts of operations for littoral maneuver and early experimentation by the Royal Marines would appear to validate this. This will, however, require shifts in how forces like the Royal Marines are structured and equipped (some of which are underway) and how their employment is conceived. It will also require a wider allied effort to align concepts of operations among both allied marine forces and littoral-oriented navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A viable concept of littoral maneuver can help reduce the possibility of a growing spatial gap between fleets operating at reach with strategic capabilities such as cruise missiles and other elements of the joint force and ensure that both marines and maritime forces more broadly can contribute to a multidomain deep battle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;前副社長陳沛敏：黎智英有鮮明價值 佔中後「企得前咗」 娛樂新聞減少&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Pbfc5hi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（2日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第22日審訊。控方完成覆問前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，結束歷時約12日的證供，接著另一名以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供的是前副社長陳沛敏。法官杜麗冰指，由於職員需要約20至25分鐘作安排，以將陳沛敏帶上庭，故押後至下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹形容國安法後-黎言論冇咁露骨&quot;&gt;張劍虹形容國安法後 黎言論「冇咁露骨」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方昨完成盤問張劍虹，今早確認沒有進一步提問。控方遂進行覆問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有關2021年4月21日的WhatsApp訊息，張劍虹向楊清奇傳來《大公報》文章截圖，當中圈出一句「直言要外國聯合制裁以致推翻國家執政黨」，張問：「主筆，你印象中我們社評有寫過這些？」楊回覆：「國安法出台前可能有」，張回覆：「出台前就不算違法」。楊續說：「出台後連老闆都唔提」，張回覆：「是」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張表示《國安法》生效之後，黎智英撰文及受訪時的言論，「冇之前國安法生效前寫得咁露骨架喇，啫係比較肯定外國制裁對阻止中國打壓香港嘅自由民主人權嘅效力咁啦。」當楊清奇說「出台後連老闆都唔提」，張理解意思是黎的言論「冇話好露骨咁話要制裁、制裁、制裁」，所以張表示同意楊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英不在數個高層群組之中-張高層可較自由表達意見&quot;&gt;黎智英不在數個高層群組之中 張：高層可較自由表達意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方早前提及因應國安法，《蘋果》高層設立了不同聊天群組，包括「國安法應變委員會」、「報紙敏感廣告小組」和「應變小組」，而張亦確認黎智英並不是上述群組成員之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今要求張澄清原因，張解釋如果黎加入群組的話，「我哋咩都唔洗傾架喇，因為全部都係由呀黎生決定哂」，但若果高層可在自己的群組中討論，「黎生唔喺度呢，大家都free 啲表達意見，睇吓係咪真係好有需要話俾黎生。」他同意這些群組的目的並不是決策，而是討論敏感議題，讓高層之間能坦白表達意見，之後才向黎表達。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方早前盤問時提到，在2020年7月4日，張劍虹把一份廣告初稿傳給前《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏，問：「有光時句子廣告，你點睇？」陳則回覆已咨詢內部法律顧問，而該廣告最終使用另外一個八字標語，而棄用「光時」。控方今展示一份廣告，可見一個楓葉圖案、「在加港人全力撐」、「五大訴求，缺一不可」、「光復香港，時代革命」，張確認當時談論的是這一份廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方將報紙顯示日期和頁數條欄放大-指有光時口號&quot;&gt;控方將報紙顯示日期和頁數條欄放大 指有「光時」口號&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年7月5日及8日的《蘋果日報》港聞版，並在電腦中將報紙頂部顯示日期和頁數的條欄放大，指出背景圖片顯示到旗幟上的「光復香港，時代革命」口號。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰留意到該條欄連續兩日都有顯示「兩制蓋棺」，張劍虹解釋，所有國安法的報導都會擺在此條欄下，國安法生效當天，《蘋果》頭版也是以「兩制蓋棺」作標題，因為按照黎智英的標準，國安法使一國兩制「玩完」，所以決定使用此字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於使用「光時」口號是誰人的主意，張表示不記得，但分工上港聞版是由陳沛敏負責，而該「光時」口號其實是一張新聞圖片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;信件顯示律政司否認警方邀請張劍虹做控方證人&quot;&gt;信件顯示律政司否認警方邀請張劍虹做控方證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方昨日提及2021年11月，張劍虹獲警方探監之後，決定轉做控方證人，並解聘原本代表他的羅拔臣律師事務所。而其新聘的劉陳律師事務所於12月16日去信律政司，表明在警方邀請之下，有意做控方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今問張知不知道，律政司在12月17日去信回覆劉陳律師事務所，稱警方並沒有邀請過其當事人。張表示「我唔清楚」，又指不知道該信件的存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示覆問完畢。法官杜麗冰指，得悉職員需要約20至25分鐘作流程上安排，以將陳沛敏帶上庭，故決定押後至下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官向張說，他已作供完畢，現可以離開法庭。張表示：「係，知道」，然後從證人座位站起身，向法官席鞠躬，之後張由懲教人員帶領下循特別通道離開法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（2日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第22日審訊。前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹早上完成歷時約12天的證供，前副社長陳沛敏下午以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。被問到《蘋果》是否一份政治性的報紙，陳表示：「我會覺得《蘋果》嗰個創辦人會有好鮮明嘅價值」，支持香港發展民主政制，另外也會尊重自由、人權這些價值，同時會重視市場反應。控方提到2014年佔中運動，陳指《蘋果》每天都會報導，黎智英亦親身參與運動，「成日去金鐘嗰度（佔領區）坐囉」。運動結束後，她指《蘋果》的娛樂新聞減少，黎的國際知名度增加，「我哋同事之間覺得佢喺社會運動度企得前咗囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏稱1996年加入蘋果-曾於2016年確診第三期癌症&quot;&gt;陳沛敏稱1996年加入《蘋果》 曾於2016年確診第三期癌症&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。其丈夫、被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」的前《立場新聞》總編輯鍾沛權，亦有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hxnYT2H.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《立場新聞》總編輯鍾沛權（左二）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳身穿杏色上衣、淺藍色褸，蓄平蔭和冬菇頭，由兩名女懲教人員經職員通道帶進法庭，她以天主教形式宣誓。陳作供期間，黎智英亦透過耳機專心地聆聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤先作主問，陳確認案發時任職《蘋果日報》副社長。壹傳媒大樓於2020年8月被警方搜查，至2021年6月17日再度被搜，而她當天亦被拘捕，之後獲警方擔保。直至同年7月21日，她在住所樓下再度被捕，其後被正式控告「串謀發布煽動刊物」和「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪。陳早前承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」，另一控罪則存檔法庭，現時正還柙等候判刑。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;個人背景方面，陳確認她在香港土生土長，大學主修工商管理，曾經在《資本雜誌》和《星島日報》工作。她離開《星島》之後，於1996年12月加入《蘋果日報》，任職高級記者。其時《蘋果日報》已發行了約一年多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，她其後獲晉升至首席記者、採訪主任和副總編輯，最終升為副社長。陳供稱她主要負責本地新聞，但當發生一些極端的國際事件，例如3.11日本大地震，她也會協助國際版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提及，她在2015年曾是總編輯，但工作了一年多之後，她在2016年確診患癌症，「嗰陣時都三期尾，要做手術、化療啦」，因此申請病假、停工了7個月。她續指，後來於2017年復工時，擔心自己的健康狀況和癌症會復發，所以跟上司張劍虹表示擔心承受不到總編輯的工作壓力。當時《蘋果》副社長退休，該職位出現空缺，在張的同意下，陳接手副社長職位，因「副社長比較副手啲，唔洗承受咁大壓力」，張亦容許陳下午才上班，工作至晚上8時便下班，「變咗夜晚黑工作可以交俾其他同事完成。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏蘋果創辦人有鮮明價值-同時著重市場&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：《蘋果》創辦人有鮮明價值 同時著重市場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，會否形容《蘋果日報》是一份政治性的報紙，還是她會形容為非政治性報紙。陳表示：「一係咁講，我會覺得《蘋果》嗰個創辦人會有好鮮明嘅價值」，支持香港發展民主政制，另外也會尊重自由、人權這些價值；不過與此同時，創辦人也會著重市場對這份報紙是否支持，例如娛樂新聞能否吸引到讀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳個人而言，她表示：「我唔否認著重新聞嘅娛樂性，不過與此同時，都會著重揭發醜聞嘅大新聞。我覺得呢啲新聞牽涉利益衝突」，例如時任財政司司長梁錦松偷步買車事件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，她提及的「創辦人」是否就是黎智英，陳確認。控方續指，黎在本案中是第一被告，不過陳可以自行選擇在作供時稱呼「第一被告」或是「黎先生」，並問她意下如何。陳則表示：「黎生簡單啲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏稱佔中後在公司見到黎智英機會增加&quot;&gt;陳沛敏稱佔中後在公司見到黎智英機會增加&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，在任職初期，她會不時見到黎在公司出現，但沒有機會跟他單獨傾談和參與正式會議。被問到黎在公司出現次數，陳表示她經常外出採訪，所以不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2014年香港發生「佔中」，問陳是否有多些機會在公司見到黎智英。陳確認：「多咗機會」，可能在一些偶發性會議中見到，「有時佢會召集會議，講佢一啲經營嘅理念。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到曾有一段時間，黎希望發展網媒，又指有一段時間「佢會覺得紙媒會沒落，佢要我哋可能好多時要諗新聞嘅畫面，畫啲動畫呀」，形容「嗰時黎生好著緊要加動畫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及《蘋果》在哪一年開始引入「動新聞」，陳憶述她於2013年擔任副總編輯，在2至3年後《蘋果》創立「動新聞」，但她不肯定確實年份。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳表示蘋果每天報導佔中新聞&quot;&gt;陳表示《蘋果》每天報導佔中新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏確認，在佔中運動期間，她是《蘋果》的副總編輯，負責靜態新聞。陳表示在整個佔中時期，《蘋果》每天都有報導與事件相關的新聞，紙媒及網媒均有，數量屬於多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指佔中時黎智英成日去金鐘坐同事認為他喺社會運動企得前咗&quot;&gt;陳指佔中時黎智英「成日去金鐘坐」同事認為他「喺社會運動企得前咗」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏又指，在一些偶然召集的會議中，黎亦可能有談及佔中的話題，「因為黎生有親自參與呢場運動，黎生有去現場參與。」陳指，會議出席者包括採訪主任等「中高層」同事，他們作為記者，而當黎「本身成為一個新聞」的時候，同事都會想問黎有關情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，黎之所以成為新聞，是因他「試過一段時間，成日去金鐘嗰度（佔領區）坐囉」，當時算是一名公眾人物。陳形容黎在2014年之前，是「一個都幾多人識嘅人」，一般認知他為「一個傳媒老闆」、「《蘋果日報》老闆」。控方問到，2014年之後黎的形象是否一樣，陳表示：「我唔可以好科學咁講，一般大眾對佢認知有冇改變」，但「我哋同事之間覺得佢喺社會運動度企得前咗囉，我會咁形容」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指2014年後黎在國際層面相對上出咗名啲-佔中後娛樂新聞減少&quot;&gt;陳指2014年後黎在國際層面「相對上出咗名啲」 佔中後娛樂新聞減少&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳形容黎在2014年之前「相對冇咁多國際上嘅人認識」，但在2014年後，他在國際層面上「應該係相對上出咗名啲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱在佔中事件後，《蘋果》娛樂新聞的版面減少，而較少聽到「狗仔隊」有新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦稱記得張劍虹大約於2014年佔中後期至完結期間，「放過一個幾長嘅假」，因為「嗰陣時佢話身體有啲問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳同意蘋果有報導2016年旺角暴動新聞&quot;&gt;陳同意《蘋果》有報導2016年旺角暴動新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另問，《蘋果》是否有報導2016年旺角暴動事件，陳同意有。但控方指事件不是歷時數天，所以不作深究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，陳同意她自2017年至案發時的2021年6月，一直為副社長的身份，需要負責紙媒。她簡述工作流程包括參與「鋤報會」、編輯前及印刷前的會議。她一般會向社長張劍虹匯報。陳解釋，紙媒有時會將電子版的新聞組合，或者改變當中的焦點角度並出版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（2月5日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-outlook-for-ukraine&quot;&gt;The Outlook for Ukraine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-futures-for-the-war-in-ukraine-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly&quot;&gt;Three Futures for the War in Ukraine: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ukrainian and Russian commanders face the problem of World War I on the Western front. To achieve victory, they need to break through the defensive zone and get “to the green fields beyond,” but that may be out of reach with existing capabilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, the path forward in Ukraine was clear: train Ukrainian forces, equip them with highly effective Western weapons, and unleash them in a counteroffensive that would push Russian forces back. Unfortunately, Ukraine got hung up in the Russian defensive zone and liberated little territory. Now, stalemate has settled in. What lies ahead for 2024? Here are three scenarios: the good — Ukraine rebuilds for another offensive and regains some lost territory; the bad — Western aid declines, leading to Ukrainian military deterioration and eventual collapse; and the ugly — a continuing stalemate on the current front lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-1&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-good--continued-aid-and-renewed-military-operations&quot;&gt;The Good — Continued Aid and Renewed Military Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war enters its third year, Ukrainian officials are pleading for continued support. President Volodymyr Zelensky recently came to Washington in person to argue his case, and Ukrainian domestic support for the war continues to be strong. The Ukrainian people are committed to liberating their territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, despite opposition from elements in Congress, aid for Ukraine continues to have strong bipartisan support in Congress and with the American people, though both are getting discouraged. There is guarded optimism about a deal that includes increased border security for the Republicans and aid to Ukraine for the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militarily, Ukrainian forces have learned a lot about the Russian defensive system and now know what to expect. In a scenario in which Ukraine is able to continue fighting effectively, it will need weapons to replace losses, which continued military aid will provide. Most of all, its forces will need training. Last year, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) established training programs from basic skills to battalion-level maneuvers to meet this need. Re-equipped and better-trained Ukrainian forces might crack the Russian lines. Ukrainian troops have beaten Russian forces before and retaken half of the territory they lost since February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this approach to be viable, Ukraine needs a theory of victory to guide its military operations and counter rising war fatigue among its supporters. How does it plan to win? This theory of victory could take many forms: a series of limited counterattacks against Russian weak points that collectively regain the lost territory, a battle of attrition that wears Russia down, or a focus on long-range strikes that squeeze Russia, particularly Crimea. Whatever the theory, Ukraine needs to lay it out convincingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-2&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-bad--aid-reductions-and-military-decline&quot;&gt;The Bad — Aid Reductions and Military Decline&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. aid to Ukraine is in the balance. A strong contingent in Congress, backed by former president Donald Trump and some think tanks, seeks to end aid. So far, they have succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a scenario where U.S. support dramatically diminishes or ends altogether, Ukraine’s future looks bleak, as laid out in a recent CSIS commentary. Ukrainian military capabilities will decline gradually. Over time, Ukraine will face increasing difficulty making local attacks to capitalize on Russian vulnerabilities, and eventually, it will struggle to contain Russian advances. Collapse would be inevitable. Before then, Ukraine would likely agree to a Russian-dictated peace to prevent catastrophic losses of territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-3&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ugly--continued-stalemate&quot;&gt;The Ugly — Continued Stalemate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front lines have changed little in the past 14 months despite hundreds of thousands of casualties. A continued stalemate on the ground is a highly likely scenario. Stalemate does not mean nothing happens; local ground assaults, long-range strikes, air attacks on infrastructure, and Ukraine’s dominance in the Black Sea will continue. Stalemate does mean that the front lines will not move much. Both sides have created formidable defensive zones with mines, trenches, strong points, and anti-tank obstacles. Ukrainian and Russian commanders face the problem of World War I on the Western front. To achieve victory, they need to break through the defensive zone and get “to the green fields beyond,” but that may be out of reach with existing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and its supporters have continually hoped for a game-changing weapon that would break the stalemate. Javelin missiles, the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), the Patriot missile defense system, M1 tanks, and Leopard tanks have all been touted as game changers, but none have brought victory even as each has added to Ukraine’s overall military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next highly anticipated weapon is the F-16 fighter jet. Indeed, Ukraine has pointed to a lack of air support as a key reason for the counteroffensive’s lack of success. Although F-16s might arrive before the end of the year, their numbers will be small (maybe 24), and the vast supporting capabilities available to NATO air forces — airborne early warning, electronic countermeasures aircraft, joint command and control — will be unavailable to the Ukrainians. The F-16s will not do for Ukraine what U.S. airpower did against Iraq, Serbia, Afghanistan, and Libya. Success, if it comes, will result from a combination of weapons and munitions, training of forces, and the people’s determination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;looking-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimism of 2023 has faded. There is always hope that negotiations will achieve what military forces could not, but the brutal truth is that facts on the ground drive peace settlements. Two of the three scenarios outlined here are Russian victories. A reduction in military aid (the bad scenario) would bring a clear Russian victory. Any peace Russia negotiates while its military power is ascendent would inevitably be unfavorable. Russia would demand not just holding on to the territory it currently occupies but also, possibly, other concessions like amnesty for war crimes and renunciation of reparations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Thus, while Europe is stepping up, it will need to do considerably more for both Ukraine and its own defense forces in 2024. That will require Europe taking extraordinary measures at the EU and national levels to ensure Ukraine is able to hold back Russian forces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s fierce response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine surprised many. As Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Europeans were shocked to see one of their capitals under attack. This prompted an unprecedented response, with Europe providing substantial military aid, welcoming millions of Ukrainian refugees, and establishing a robust sanctions regime. Perhaps just as remarkable, today, after nearly two years of war and a major energy shock, European support for Ukraine remains robust. Yet signs of strain are emerging that may prevent Europe from living up to its rhetoric to support Ukraine “as long as it takes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the war becoming a protracted conflict and Russia looking to go back on the offensive, Europe will need to create new instruments and funding mechanisms to support Ukraine, especially if the United States stops sending aid. The sense of political urgency that existed in 2022 has faded. Now with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s Hungary becoming a major difficulty, along with German-led demands for a European-wide return to tight fiscal policy, European support for Ukraine may be far below what is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to forget how surprisingly strong Europe’s response to the war has been. Prior to the invasion, U.S. officials working on sanctions policy believed they would have to pull Europe along, as they did in response to Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014. Yet the EU sanctions response, such as pushing for an oil embargo and adopting sanctions against Russia’s central bank, often caught Washington by surprise. European countries, including the European Union itself, also took unprecedented steps to provide military support to Ukraine. Countries like Germany and Sweden provided lethal aid to a country in conflict for the first time, and the European Union used its European Peace Facility fund to provide Ukraine with lethal assistance. Europe is now collectively providing more support than the United States to Ukraine. The clear threat posed by Russia prompted historic steps from Sweden and Finland to join the NATO alliance. Defense spending also dramatically increased across the continent, with Germany leading the way with the announcement of a new €100 billion Zeitenwende defense fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European support for Ukraine remains high despite the war causing significant economic hardship in Europe. Russian president Vladimir Putin’s throttling of gas deliveries into Europe and the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines caused an energy crisis with Europeans seeing a dramatic increase in prices. The situation led to significant inflation and undermined European economic competitiveness. Yet European leaders reacted with remarkable speed, such as by buying liquefied natural gas and rapidly building new infrastructure. Remarkably, European citizens also responded by cutting their energy demand by 15–20 percent, turning down the thermostat and putting on sweaters. There is no clearer example of steadfast European support than in Germany, where in the wake of a German constitutional court ruling that prompted German leaders to cut €17 billion from its budget, funding for Ukraine was protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are challenges ahead. First, the dynamic of the war in Ukraine has changed. In 2022 and 2023, European militaries were providing Ukraine with older equipment from their militaries, but now that equipment is mostly gone. Europe has little equipment on hand to give, which is problematic because it means if the United States stops providing military aid, Europe will be unable to fill the gap. It also means that for Europe to maintain support to Ukraine, it will have to buy new equipment from its defense industries. Not only will this be more expensive, but it also requires Europeans do more to coordinate their efforts, something European defense ministries struggle to do. As a result, production lines to aid Ukraine and refill European warehouses are not yet running at full speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Prime Minister Orbán has demonstrated a willingness to block EU support for Ukraine. At the European Council summit in December 2023, Orbán agreed to abstain on the decision to begin ascension negotiations with Ukraine, the next step on Ukraine’s road to EU membership. The European Union had just released more than €10 billion in funds for Hungary that it was holding for rule-of-law violations. However, despite receiving the funds, Orbán noted that he still opposed Ukraine moving toward membership and that there would be many opportunities to block Ukraine’s membership in the future. The next day, Orbán blocked the European Union from providing €50 billion in support for Ukraine. EU leaders were ultimately successful in pressuring Orbán to sign on to the €50 billion financial support to Ukraine at a special February 1 European Council summit. But with Ukraine still needing more military support from the European Union, the European Union and Ukraine’s Hungary problem has not gone away. The need for unanimity for major policy and funding decisions will continue to give Orbán significant leverage and ability to hold Ukrainian funding hostage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, and perhaps an even more acute challenge, is the return of austerity economics to the European Union. Last year’s ruling of the German constitutional court that the German government was violating its constitutional requirement to have a balanced budget has led to immediate budget cuts, despite Germany suffering from a major deficit of infrastructure investment. Moreover, the EU Stability and Growth Pact, which sets rules for the national budgets of eurozone countries, returned on January 1, 2024, after being suspended in response to the pandemic. While the pact was amended to give governments more flexibility, the reinstitution of the pact will still put pressure on European governments to cut spending, making additional outlays for defense of Ukraine more difficult. Germany, for instance, has kept its funding for Ukraine at the national level but is now opposing increases to the European Peace Facility, which is used to support Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, while Europe is stepping up, it will need to do considerably more for both Ukraine and its own defense forces in 2024. That will require Europe taking extraordinary measures at the EU and national levels to ensure Ukraine is able to hold back Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The ongoing political polarization preventing the Western political mainstream from reaching consensus on essential questions, diffuse power structures, and multiple political chokepoints provide a favorable dynamic for the Kremlin to achieve its goals, especially if its propagandist campaigns are successful in convincing Western audiences the war is too costly for them domestically.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent Ukrainian counteroffensive in the second half of 2023 has exposed Ukraine’s military vulnerabilities on the one hand and Russia’s strengthened defense capabilities on the other. Among the top challenges facing Ukraine is speedy and uninterrupted access to Western military equipment and technology. Ukrainians also require reconstruction support from the West, which is vital to shore up their morale and bring back some of the millions of exiled citizens. Russia, on the contrary, has ramped up domestic arms production, increased the number of volunteers to fight in the war, and successfully continued its sanctions circumvention efforts. Absent consistent large-scale economic and military assistance from the West, Russia might gain a significant military advantage over Ukraine in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provision of support to Ukraine depends on Western ability to maintain unity. However, by late 2023 this unity had started to crumble. In total, newly committed aid by allies dropped by almost 90 percent between August and October 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Of the 42 previous Ukrainian country donors, only 20 committed new aid packages between October and December 2023, the lowest number since the start of the war. Ukraine is also becoming hostage to partisan battles in the West, as its support has increasingly been contested in both the European Union and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is hoping to exploit these partisan dynamics and further undermine support for Ukraine in the West by using tools such as gas dependencies, investments and oligarchs, disinformation, intelligence and spies, and support for populist parties. Some of these tools are analyzed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-leverage&quot;&gt;Energy Leverage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war, the Kremlin has attempted to undermine Western unity through its energy tools. In preparation for the war, Russian state-controlled energy giant Gazprom gradually reduced gas supplies to Europe. By mid-2022, the European Union was experiencing a 60 percent drop in Russian gas deliveries compared to mid-2021. Russia coupled gas supply reductions with high-volume information campaigns as its state-linked media broadcasted fights and protests breaking out in Europe due to high energy prices. Gazprom also released ads threatening to freeze Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To replace Russian gas, Europe hiked imports of liquefied natural gas from other countries while slashing gas use. The loss of Russia’s cheap natural gas was particularly consequential for Germany, one of its main consumers. Supply disruptions pushed up electricity prices, forcing Berlin to spend billions of euros to ease the burden of rising bills and deepening Germany’s budget crisis. High costs of hydrocarbons prompted German chemical giant BASF to cut jobs and stop its share buybacks. As a result, Germany experienced a minor recession in 2023, becoming the world’s worst-performing major developed economy and the only G7 economy to contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, besides Germany, the drag on EU economic activity was not as deep as expected when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began and the first comprehensive sanctions took place. Moreover, gas prices returned to prewar levels in 2023. At least in the short term, the European Union has successfully adapted and accumulated substantial natural gas inventories sufficient to survive winter 2023. It seems Gazprom, rather than the European Union, took the greatest blow from its own actions by losing much of the European markets and undermining its own geopolitical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;information-leverage&quot;&gt;Information Leverage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2022, the Kremlin’s disinformation strategy failed to sell its pro-war narratives in the West. The U.S. administration’s strategy of disclosing classified intel contributed to exposing Russia’s propagandist efforts. Western public opinion almost uniformly sided with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia subsequently adapted its information strategy to emphasize domestic costs of the war for the West. Thus, comparing to the early months of war, later in 2022, Russia-linked accounts on Twitter had reduced mentions of Nazis and NATO, replacing them with complaints about energy and cost of living. In France, the Kremlin-backed disinformation effort pushed the talking points that Western sanctions against Russia have damaged the economy through a decline in trade and left the country at risk of falling into the deepest social and economic crisis, and that the supply of arms to Ukraine has undermined the country’s ability to defend itself. This approach has worked much better for Russia. As measured by the popularity of those narratives in Western domestic debates, claims that the West’s support for Ukraine is too costly or too risky have found much more fertile ground with Western audiences by playing to pocket-book concerns and war fatigue rather than historical or geopolitical grievances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another disinformation effort is aimed at presenting Western support for Ukraine as futile or hypocritical. A recent BBC study found thousands of fake accounts on TikTok spreading false claims about senior Ukrainian officials and their relatives, presenting them as obsessed with money and uncaring about the war effort. Russian diplomats and Kremlin-linked media platforms are also spreading accusations that the West has a double standard about civilian casualties when it comes to Ukraine and Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-leverage&quot;&gt;Political Leverage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, Russia’s influence in Europe and the United States has relied on its links to non-mainstream populist political actors. At the start of the 2022 war, this leverage seemed to have disappeared when many European populists shifted their stances following their voters’ uniform condemnation of Putin and embrace of Ukraine. Most notably, Matteo Salvini’s Lega and Giorgia Meloni’s Fratelli d’Italia parties both flipped their stances to adopt more pro-Europe, pro-U.S., and anti-Russia positions. The intensity of condemnation, however, varied, with some parties presenting others as being at least partially responsible for the war along with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent months, however, old and new populist parties have become more critical of support for Ukraine. On the left, the newly elected Slovakian government led by Prime Minister Robert Fico in early November 2023 rejected a draft plan to donate rockets and ammunition to Kyiv, while prominent German politician Sahra Wagenknecht announced plans to launch a new party opposing sanctions against Russia and arms supplies to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the right, former U.S. president Donald Trump, who leads in the 2024 Republican primaries, has offered more scrutiny on military budgets, as his supporters in Congress blocked funding to the bill that included aid for Ukraine. France’s National Rally and Germany’s Alternative for Germany are growing in popularity, presenting the war in Ukraine as a waste of European resources. In the Netherlands, the recent victory of the far-right Party for Freedom (PVV), which offered to halt military and financial support for Ukraine, threatens the assistance of the fifth-largest EU aid provider to Ukraine. But the main proponent of lifting Western sanctions against Russia and blocking aid for Ukraine is Hungary’s far-right prime minister Viktor Orbán. He has adopted a successful strategy of threatening to block European financial aid for Ukraine and Ukraine’s EU accession unless the European Commission unblocks frozen funds for Hungary. The commission’s recent caving into his blackmail sets a dangerous precedent, which other actors might soon pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;will-the-western-coalition-stick-together&quot;&gt;Will the Western Coalition Stick Together?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming months, the Kremlin is likely to continue using energy, political, and informational tools along the lines discussed here. At the core of Putin’s strategy is identifying the points of discord in the West and amplifying them with a goal of complicating Western ability to sustain consistent support for Ukraine. The ongoing political polarization preventing the Western political mainstream from reaching consensus on essential questions, diffuse power structures, and multiple political chokepoints provide a favorable dynamic for the Kremlin to achieve its goals, especially if its propagandist campaigns are successful in convincing Western audiences the war is too costly for them domestically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears the Western tide is turning for Ukraine. But the problem goes beyond the Kremlin’s aptitude to exploit Western divisions. Broadly speaking, Ukraine is suffering from the West’s inability to understand the existential importance of the war for its own survival and its policymakers’ continued lack of strategy for ensuring victory. Since early 2022, the West has offered Ukraine just enough military aid to survive but not enough to threaten Russia with defeat, which has allowed the Kremlin time to improve its military positions and undermine popular support for Ukraine in the West. The current situation generates multiple fissures in the West, which — if the past is any indication — the Kremlin will prove very apt at exploiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s future depends on the outcomes on the battlefield as much as on the economic front.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector is the main motor of growth of any functioning market economy, creating jobs; introducing new products, services, and processes; and transferring technology and know-how. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 90 percent of all business activity worldwide and contribute over 50 percent of global employment. Companies are also major sources of tax revenue for governments, helping fund public services. This is the case in Ukraine, where the private sector — comprising approximately 1.6 million individual entrepreneurs, 400,000 SMEs, and 500 large enterprises — contributes significantly to the economy and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the war has affected businesses across sectors of the Ukrainian economy, damaging facilities and logistics routes and disrupting supply chains, leading to sales losses and unemployment. Ukraine is fighting as much a military war against Russia as an economic war. The enemy is trying not only to occupy land, wipe out physical infrastructure, and inflict mass civilian casualties but also to cripple the economy, targeting critical industries including transport and logistics, agriculture, energy, digital, and the defense industrial base. Ukraine’s future depends on the outcomes on the battlefield as much as on the economic front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the war, the private sector has exhibited remarkable resilience. According to the American Chamber of Commerce’s September 2023 Ukraine survey, even one and a half years into the conflict, 98 percent of its member companies were still operational in Ukraine. Although GDP fell by nearly 30 percent in 2022, it is forecast to grow by 3.5 percent in 2023, partly due to the resilient information technology (IT) sector and the rerouting of exports. Since the war started, Ukraine attracted more than $500 million in new investments, according to data by UkraineInvest, the country’s investment promotion agency. These new investments are taking place in regions that are not under active combat, such as the western and central parts of the country. A large portion of Ukraine — close to 85 percent of its territory — is unoccupied, where businesses can operate and grow. The Global Business for Ukraine’s investment map showcases 146 investment-ready projects totaling $4.9 billion. On the other hand, large reconstruction projects in the east and southeast of Ukraine (regions that have been heavily destroyed) will probably have to wait until the war is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s allies and partners are supporting Ukraine’s right to defend itself by providing military aid. Through humanitarian and budgetary assistance — which pays the salaries of soldiers, pensioners, and teachers and finances essential public services — they are also helping the economy stay afloat. However, only a small part of this aid is being directed to help current businesses and attract new investors. Moreover, the war continues, and a political settlement is unlikely anytime soon. This complicates the situation of the private sector. Donor countries will continue supporting Ukraine, but these amounts will likely decline over time and fulfill only part of the country’s financial needs. The international community needs to work with the government of Ukraine to spur business and attract new investments into the country so they can create jobs and generate tax revenues. International financial institutions (IFIs) and development finance institutions (DFIs) could do more in this area, even amid the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian businesses have many financing needs at the moment, in particular equity investments. The capital needs are immense. The destruction of manufacturing facilities, logistical lines, and supply chains has forced some companies to rebuild their business models from scratch. Some companies were able to adapt to the war, but in many cases they require capital. The impact that new capital can produce in this environment is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IFIs and donors are exploring new finance mechanisms to support the private sector in Ukraine. They are also providing technical and legal advice on how to reform laws (e.g., the public-private partnership law) and important institutions so Ukraine can become “investor-ready.” However, as they approach operations in Ukraine, they need to be more creative, coordinated, and willing to take risks. They must devise new instruments to leverage private capital for smaller projects that could provide demonstration effects for other investors. Although these institutions are doing incredible work to support the economy, they have not adapted their business model to operate more creatively in a war zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IFIs and DFIs could set up new finance vehicles, such as investment funds where donors would provide a first-loss tranche to attract other investors. These funds could potentially be funded by using frozen Russian central bank assets worth $300 billion, or the interest proceeds, which in Europe amount to $3 billion a year. In addition, DFIs could ramp up existing risk mitigation mechanisms such as loan portfolio guarantees, which would help existing businesses access finance at reasonable rates. One example is the support that the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is lending to the Bank Lviv. Although these amounts are small, this instrument could be expanded. Additionally, a more coordinated and scalable political risk (or war risk) insurance mechanism may create the confidence needed for private sector investments to flow in Ukraine. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is working on such a scheme, but it is still not operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors also want to see more significant governance and economic reforms in Ukraine to improve the business climate in the country. This includes turbocharging anti-corruption efforts, devising a clear strategy to restructure state-owned enterprises and inefficient businesses, and de-oligarchizing the economy. This reform agenda must align with the conditions under Ukraine’s EU accession process to ensure harmonization with EU laws and standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting corruption is paramount if Ukraine wants to attract investments and join the European family. Society at large considers corruption as the number two problem in the country after the war, according to a recent survey. The latest edition of Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index shows that Ukraine still scores poorly at 36 points out of 100 (half of France’s score and 18 points behind Poland). However, Ukraine has made strong inroads in the fight against corruption, including increased criminal proceedings against suspected perpetrators, judiciary reforms, a competitive selection process for the heads of the main anti-corruption agencies, and improvements in public procurement. This is an area where the international community can play a critical role, providing both advice and pressure for reforms. Ukrainian civil society and independent journalists are important allies in this fight. Ukraine still has a long road ahead but must keep this momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s future membership in the European Union is also a big incentive for investors. Ukraine’s entry into the European Union will provide companies with enough confidence that there is a level playing field for doing business in the country. Moreover, it will give companies access to more than 40 million consumers in Ukraine, with an added 450 million consumers in the European Union. Recent investor surveys point out that access to the EU market and EU product quality and standards are key to future business opportunities in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has huge investment potential given its low-cost skilled labor, a market size of more than 40 million consumers, and proximity to the EU market. There are many business opportunities in sectors such as oil and gas, strategic minerals, IT, and agriculture. Ukraine also has the potential to become a manufacturing hub for its neighborhood, reaching more than 800 million consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine moves away from its Soviet past and looks toward a bright economic future, developing a strong and vibrant private sector will provide tax revenues, jobs, and economic security. The international community can help provide more predictability and stability for companies operating in Ukraine and create innovative mechanisms to attract private capital. It might be risky to invest in Ukraine during wartime, but not investing is a larger missed opportunity. Ukrainians cannot wait until a peace settlement is reached. With the prospect that economic assistance will not last forever, the international community needs to find ways to make the economy more self-sufficient. The time to act is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is hard to overstate how important a Ukrainian victory — or, at the very least, a Russian loss — is for U.S. and Western interests, broadly defined. Yet it is also hard to overstate how important the issue of allied spending on defense and security (or lack thereof) is to Washington policymakers, some of whom now question why the United States — rather than Europe — must continue supporting Ukraine.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) turns 75 in 2024, and the allies will meet in the summer in Washington, D.C., to mark the occasion. A key question on many observers’ minds is, How will NATO manage what is arguably one of the biggest crises in European security in the alliance’s history — the Russian war against Ukraine? The answer to that question will, for many, inform perceptions of the utility and purpose of the alliance for both current and emerging threats to the Euro-Atlantic region. Of course, crystal balls are inherently foggy; rather than predict a specific answer, it is far better to think about what factors are likely to inform such allied decisions at NATO’s 75th anniversary summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, despite the fact that the war in Ukraine is affecting all NATO members, Ukraine itself is not a NATO member state. This is a point of frustration for several central and eastern European countries in particular, many of which waged an intense but ultimately unsuccessful diplomatic campaign for Ukraine to be invited to join the alliance in the run-up to the 2023 NATO Vilnius summit. As the logic went, inviting Ukraine to join NATO would be a way to force a cessation of hostilities, as many observers believe that Putin’s Russia does not want to want to wage war against NATO itself. The counterargument to Ukrainian NATO membership was that it would have immediately committed NATO and its member states to a major war with Russia. A half measure was instead agreed at Vilnius; among other things, Ukraine was promised membership in the future, as conditions allow, but without all the strings normally attached to the membership accession processes. But the bottom line remains that Ukraine is not a NATO ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, NATO’s responses to the Ukraine crisis are primarily inwardly focused. One major area of work addresses preparing the alliance to deter and defend against a Russian attack on NATO territories (among other threats) through a series of reorganized war plans. Another key area focuses on encouraging members to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense programs. And still another addresses reexamining the NATO defense industrial base after shortfalls in basic areas like ammunition have become apparent. As for Ukraine, NATO will continue to aid the war-torn country through humanitarian assistance, nonlethal aid, and capacity-building measures. Allies will continue providing both lethal and nonlethal aid, assuming their domestic politics allow for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for domestic politics, therein lies the rub. It is hard to overstate how important a Ukrainian victory — or, at the very least, a Russian loss — is for U.S. and Western interests, broadly defined. Yet it is also hard to overstate how important the issue of allied spending on defense and security (or lack thereof) is to Washington policymakers, some of whom now question why the United States — rather than Europe — must continue supporting Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about “burden sharing” are as old as the alliance itself. The need for Europe to spend more on defense has been routinely expressed across U.S. administrations for decades. Prior to departing the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates argued to the allies that if they did not spend more on defense, future presidents would have a hard time making the case to continue investing in NATO. At the NATO summit in Vilnius in 2023, U.S. senator Ashley Tillis argued that burden sharing is the most critical issue before the alliance today. Yet, as of 2022, only seven European NATO states had spent 2 percent or more of their GDP on defense. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the world is where it is: the United States is frustrated that Europe does not put its money where its mouth is, and Europe is frustrated with being repeatedly browbeaten over the subject and with a U.S. presidential contender who, if elected, might attempt to pull the United States out of NATO altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debate and related concerns about defense spending have been — and are — grounded in real concerns about what it takes to meaningfully defend allied territory and interests, especially as the alliance faces a Russian bear with a growing geopolitical appetite. But the problem with evaluating burden sharing against defense spending is that it turns what should be a strategic-level discussion among allies about what they can and should do to meet shared challenges into a transactional, nickel-and-dime issue of cost sharing. Because the value of NATO is being reduced to a discussion over dollars and euros, the broader strategic utility of the NATO alliance for U.S. interests is being lost. And Ukraine now hangs in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A decisive defeat of the Russian military is in the interest of the United States. Therefore, Congress should act quickly to provide Ukraine with the needed support to accomplish this goal. The longer assistance is delayed, the harder it will be to secure a Ukrainian victory and the more money and lives will be lost in the long run.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 24, 2022, millions watched in disbelief as Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Within two weeks, the U.S. Congress passed legislation allocating nearly $14 billion in support of Ukraine. Nearly two years later, the urgency in Washington seems to have evaporated. Meanwhile, Ukrainians continue to die on the front lines. Sirens continue to wail, warning citizens of incoming missiles, and mothers continue to search for their children abducted by Russian forces. Ukrainians are left to wonder, Will the world’s most powerful democracy abandon us in our darkest hour? Each passing day that Congress fails to approve additional assistance weakens the position of the Ukrainians, both militarily and politically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite waning urgency, bipartisan support in Congress for continued U.S. assistance to Ukraine remains strong. Looking at the voting patterns in the House of Representatives, where support for assistance to Ukraine is more fragile, opposition has grown slightly, but not significantly, over the past two years. Parsing out members’ positions on Ukraine can be challenging since aid has often been part of broader packages. However, three key votes can help inform the trends on support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stand-alone vote on assistance to Ukraine occurred in May 2022 when Congress took up a $39.4 billion package. Prior votes on assistance were part of larger legislative packages that garnered opposition for reasons notwithstanding assistance to Ukraine. This bill passed the House overwhelmingly by a vote of 368–57 and the Senate by a vote of 86–11. The next stand-alone votes on assistance to Ukraine did not occur until the House took up the fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). During consideration of the NDAA, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene offered an amendment to eliminate $300 million in assistance to Ukraine. The amendment failed by a vote of 341–89. Representative Matt Gaetz offered an amendment to prohibit all U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, which failed by an even wider margin, 358–70. Using the Greene and Gaetz amendment votes as a marker, a solid majority of the 221 members that make up the House Republican Conference continue to support U.S. assistance to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these vote trends tell a more positive story than what is often portrayed in the media, worries over declining support are not misplaced, particularly as the United States embarks on a hotly contested and emotionally fraught presidential campaign cycle. While U.S. president Joseph Biden is a strong supporter of continued assistance to Ukraine, many congressional Republicans feel the administration has failed to lay out a clear strategy to support victory. According to a November 2023 Gallup poll, a plurality — 41 percent — of Americans feel the United States is doing too much to support Ukraine, with 33 percent saying the United States is doing the right amount and 25 percent stating the United States is not doing enough. After February 24, 2022, President Biden did not formally address the nation again on the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine until October 2023. The president and other supporters of continued assistance to Ukraine should continue to make the case to voters about why supporting a decisive Ukrainian victory is in the interest of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their argument should be one of principles and self-interest. On principles, the case is straightforward: Russian president Vladimir Putin — an unelected dictator — invaded a sovereign nation in an attempt to overthrow Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, who was elected by the citizens of Ukraine in a free and fair election. During the course of this invasion, Russian soldiers brutally and systematically massacred noncombatant civilians. One need only stand in front of the memorial marking the mass grave in Bucha to learn of children as young as four years old being killed by the Russians. Ukrainian authorities have identified at least 16,000 children abducted by Russia since the start of the war, though they worry the true number may be far greater. The extensive documentation leaves little room to doubt Russia has committed and continues to commit crimes against humanity. Furthermore, should Putin seize control of broad swaths of Ukrainian territory, this sends the message to other dictators with expansionist ideations — such as Xi Jinping in China — that one need only to outlast the short attention span of the world’s democracies to achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the reasons to support Ukraine go beyond the moral imperative of the conflict. Analysis of the $113 billion appropriated to support Ukraine shows much of that money has gone to modernize U.S. weapons stockpiles, reinvigorate the U.S. defense industrial base, and invest in U.S. military personnel. Aid appropriated in the supplemental spending bills for Ukraine provided nearly half a billion dollars for Lockheed Martin to surge production of the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) in the town of Camden, Arkansas — a welcome economic boost. Similar infusions of spending have benefited towns across the United States, including Lima, Ohio, where Abrams tanks are produced, and Ocala, Florida, and Troy, Alabama, which are home to Javelin missile factories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the economic boon for the defense industrial base, U.S. business stands to benefit from the transformation and reconstruction of Ukraine. A World Bank estimate from March 2023 places the cost of rebuilding Ukraine at $411 billion. Continued U.S. support for Ukraine will ensure U.S. companies and businesses are welcomed to participate in the effort. Emphasizing pocketbook issues such as job creation and economic growth potential is especially important in a consequential election year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absent leadership in the White House, it is up to members of Congress to clearly articulate to their constituents why it is imperative to continue to support Ukraine’s victory. The moral argument is clear. However, politicians need to appeal to the self-interest of the American public as well. A decisive defeat of the Russian military is in the interest of the United States. Therefore, Congress should act quickly to provide Ukraine with the needed support to accomplish this goal. The longer assistance is delayed, the harder it will be to secure a Ukrainian victory and the more money and lives will be lost in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For Israel, in the years ahead, every day will be October 8 but with the fear that it is October 6. Isreal’s sense of security after decades of limited conflict with its neighbors has been shattered.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earthquakes have aftershocks,” a veteran Israeli intelligence officer told a CSIS delegation on a recent visit to that country, “and sometimes the aftershocks are more important than the earthquake.” He spoke wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Israel, this was a transformative event, every bit as much as the Six-Day War in 1967 or the 1973 Yom Kippur War. On October 7, 2023, Israel suffered an attack of unparalleled barbarity as thousands of Hamas fighters, led by the elite Nukhba forces and followed by the less disciplined Qassam Brigades and finally mobs of Gazans, attacked at over two dozen points along the frontier. During the initial fighting, 1,200 Israelis, 900 of them civilians, including children and invalids, were slaughtered; men and women were raped and mutilated; and hundreds were taken hostage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Israel, in the years ahead, every day will be October 8 but with the fear that it is October 6. Isreal’s sense of security after decades of limited conflict with its neighbors has been shattered. The existential question is on the table because Israel soon entered a war on multiple fronts including on its northern border, as Hezbollah joined in the fight in a limited way; on the West Bank; and even further afield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel will now no longer trust in its ability to detect and preempt threats; instead it will seek to prevent them. Israeli political and military leaders will be much more ready than in the past to initiate conflict if they think that by doing so they can reduce the possibility of another day like that one, or worse. It will arm itself more intensively and wage war with a kind of disciplined aggression it has not shown in some time. It will not crumble or weaken because it has shown itself to be a resilient society; it is wounded, enraged, and determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting features of this war has been the muted public reactions of many governments around the world, even in the face of protests and demonstrations in the streets. Israel’s Arab partners, including Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, quietly share their fears and hatred of Hamas, itself an outgrowth of the Muslim Brotherhood. They will not openly support Israel’s actions, though they will do so quietly. The global war against extreme versions of Islamism never really ended, but it has now come back and with a vengeance. Moderate Muslim states are also going to find themselves on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Iran, the war has been a huge, if perilous, success. Its strategy of building a ring of enemies around Israel — to include Hamas (which it helped arm and train), Hezbollah in Lebanon (far more heavily equipped than Hamas), various Shiite militias in Syria that can attack Israel on the Golan Heights, and the Houthis in Yemen — seems to be working. The purpose may not be to destroy Israel in one blow but rather to weaken it in a series of wars, as Iran itself is protected by the nuclear deterrent it seeks to acquire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, considerable danger of over-reach. The Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping invite a U.S.-led response. Whether through tit-for-tat escalation or because of a decision to make a larger point, the day may well come when the United States, with or without its allies, attacks not only the Houthis but their Iranian advisers and logistics as well. Neighbors probably fear Iran more than ever and will be willing to be quiet partners in counterstrikes against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility, therefore, exists for a substantial regional war in the near future. It could come about because of an Israeli preventive war against Hezbollah or merely escalation of the fighting along the current border. It might begin in an attempt by Hezbollah to emulate Hamas with a similar strategy of building up its forces along the Israeli frontier and striking suddenly. Or it could come about through an escalation of U.S. strikes on Iranian targets in Yemen and retaliation by Iran against Persian Gulf shipping, creating a broader conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the alignment of states on the Israel-Hamas war is revealing. Russia and China are more or less openly supporting Hamas and Iran; the United States and its allies are supporting Israel. It is the same set of opposing coalitions as in the Russia-Ukraine war and, with some adjustments, the increasing tensions in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upshot is that when Hamas terrorists stormed across the fence dividing them from Israel and began the slaughter of civilians, they accelerated the division of the world into opposing blocs. They brought to the fore the challenges posed to liberal democracies in confronting enemies who openly embrace extreme brutality directed against civilians, as Russia has in Ukraine. This war is not entirely separable from other conflicts in which the United States is an interested and committed party, and it may turn out to be a trigger for other, even more devastating conflicts in the Levant, the Persian Gulf, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Israel, however, faces a different challenge in Gaza than the United States did in Iraq or Afghanistan — in many ways, a much harder one.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a shocked Israel prepared to respond to the October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack, the most devastating in Israel’s history, U.S. president Joe Biden offered some sober advice: “After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. And while we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.” Looking back at the U.S. wars on terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq, Biden, along with many American strategists, urged Israel to heed the lessons the United States won so dearly and avoid the many mistakes made along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons from Afghanistan and Iraq are extensive and still being compiled, but how relevant are they to Israel’s situation with Hamas? As might be expected, some apply more than others, and a few do not apply at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. counterinsurgency model, as embodied in documents like Joint Publication 3-24, Counterinsurgency, stresses the political side of counterinsurgency. In both Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States focused largely on defeating Saddam Hussein’s regime and the Taliban but less on what should replace them, resulting in sustained — and, in the case of the Taliban in Afghanistan, successful — insurgencies. Establishing a legitimate and competent government after military victory is vital, as this ensures support from the people and allows law enforcement and social services to function. All this requires empowering local partners, who will bear the brunt of the fighting. In Afghanistan, the United States lost 2,443 troops, while the Afghan military lost at least 66,000, to say nothing of the tens of thousands of Afghan civilian casualties. Strong local partners and successful governance, in turn, ensure popular support. As Chinese leader Mao Zedong famously argued, the guerrillas must swim in the sea of the people, and if the people are against the guerrillas, then their end is certain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the United States now prefers to avoid long wars and accept that some level of risk is inevitable. The U.S. preference is to conduct shorter counterterrorism-focused efforts rather than grinding occupations that require decades of effort. When sustained insurgencies must be fought, the United States seeks to work with local governments, warlords, or other partners, supporting them with training and, at times, airstrikes or other limited military support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these lessons are applicable to Israel’s current war with Hamas. Most importantly, Israel must develop a long-term political strategy for Gaza. As Raphael Cohen has argued, the current situation has grown, in part, out of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Israel’s decades-long failed strategy of “mowing the grass” in Gaza — which attempted to both contain and deter Hamas in Gaza, while simultaneously not addressing any of the underlying economic and political conditions that had helped bring Hamas into power and keep it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel, however, faces a different challenge in Gaza than the United States did in Iraq or Afghanistan — in many ways, a much harder one. Geography poses the first problem. Gaza is on Israel’s doorstep, while the United States has the luxury of distance. What happened in Baghdad or Kabul did not pose an immediate threat to the U.S. homeland. Israel cannot wash its hands of Gaza as the United States eventually did with Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Israel has had a less solutionist approach than the United States. It sees Palestinian hatred as almost inevitable, and the Second Intifada and the 2005 Gaza withdrawal proved to many Israelis that concessions to Palestinian leaders would be met with violence (though the truth is far more complex). The latest Hamas attack, made in the aftermath of what Israel saw as an accommodating approach to Hamas in Gaza, will reinforce this view. Thus, Israelis believe a political approach designed to win over the Palestinian people is doomed to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel also lacks local partners who might govern Gaza and serve Israeli interests. In Afghanistan and Iraq, numerous local leaders sought to work with the United States against the insurgents (even as they were often critical of U.S. policies), and they had genuine support among many communities in these countries. Israel will find few, if any, Palestinians willing to work with it, in part because its policies have steadily undermined the more pro-peace Palestinian Authority, convincing many Palestinians that Israel will respond only to force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Israel must engage in military operations in a saturated media environment, with widespread transparency regarding civilian casualties, destruction of infrastructure in Gaza, and other horrors of war. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the battlefields were remote, and much of the fighting occurred when social media was in its infancy. Now the genuine destructiveness of the Israeli response (worsened by widespread misinformation) is there for all to see, eroding international support for Israel, including in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden and other U.S. leaders are right to urge caution on Israel and to encourage Israeli security officials to understand what the United States has learned in its various wars on terrorism. But the Israeli war on Hamas has its own characteristics, many of which are far more difficult than what the United States faced in Afghanistan or Iraq. As a result, Israel will learn its own lessons — and make its own mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Israelis may fantasize about a divorce from Palestinians, but their actions for three-quarters of a century have made that increasingly impossible.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With violence between Palestinians and Israelis at its highest levels in decades, voices again have risen in favor of a two-state solution. The idea — a Jewish homeland and an Arab one carved out of Mandatory Palestine — dates back to the United Nations’ 1947 partition plan, but it has seemed increasingly remote. In the weeks before October 7, the growing consensus was that the window for a two-state solution had closed. The current violence has persuaded many that the idea needs to be revived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed it does, but doing so will require the redefinition of some terms — for starters, “two,” and “state,” and “solution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with “two.” Seventy-five years of history have intertwined the fates of Arabs and Jews far more than had ever been contemplated. Not only has Jewish settlement extended deep into formerly Arab areas, but the 20 percent of Israeli citizens who are non-Jewish Arabs have come to think of their Palestinian-ness (and Israeli-ness) in complex and connected ways. Resources, not least water, are inextricably linked, but even things as mundane as wireless spectrum are completely intertwined. Israelis may fantasize about a divorce from Palestinians, but their actions for three-quarters of a century have made that increasingly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palestinians have been enveloped in that process, too. The Palestinian economy has become deeply integrated with the Israeli economy, even as permission to work in Israel is unreliable. Just last summer, Israel was the destination for 90 percent of Palestinian exports and the source of 58 percent of its imports. While Palestine certainly needs a more diversified economy and set of trade ties, building it all from scratch without taking advantage of Israeli infrastructure and ports, not to mention the technical skills for things like managing the money supply and credit markets, will make the task infinitely harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each side has ample evidence from the past 30 years of how hard arm’s length cooperation is. Palestinians note that Israeli security forces not only have continually burst into areas of supposed Palestinian self-rule but also have been lax on vigilante settlers who seek to be a law unto themselves. Not unreasonably, they see Israeli businesspeople taking advantage of Palestine as a captive market to their own advantage and at the expense of Palestinian interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israelis have complained that Palestinian security cooperation has always been grudging and incomplete, and they blame poor Palestinian economic performance on corruption and incompetence rather than Israeli exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than more separation, however, the anti-dote to these complaints is greater integration, albeit with outside enforcement. A multinational endeavor with Israelis and Palestinians at its core, with the active participation of Americans, Europeans, regional governments, and others, will be awkward at first. But giving Palestinians and Israelis greater visibility into each other’s actions will give greater confidence. Equally important will be noting when cooperation is not forthcoming, also giving greater confidence that agreements cannot be ignored without consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;state&quot;&gt;State&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where “state” needs to be redefined. What will emerge is something less than a Westphalian state with complete control over what happens within its borders, and not just for Palestinians. Israel will also need to open its decisionmaking to justify some of its actions to others, and to consider the broader implications of actions it principally targets at its own citizens. The European Union has shown much of this is possible, but what will be required here will be more intrusive and less consensual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this will be messy, which brings us to the last problem in this trilogy: the “solution.” One might object that what is described here is not a solution at all, because it will require sustained engagement and struggle from two parties who were largely estranged before the massacres of October 7, and are even more estranged in their aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the challenge, each side is convinced that sizeable constituencies on the other side ultimately seek domination and not coexistence. While this reality cannot be willed away, much less ignored, one thing is especially encouraging. That is, through more than three decades of polling, it is clear how dynamic the support for coexistence has been, and therefore how dynamic the support can be. It responds to conditions, and it responds to actions. There is little question that, right now, it is close to bottom, and there is tremendous upward potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strategy of this sort will be unacceptable to both sides, at least initially. It is not what they have been fighting for over the last 75 years, and it feels inadequate. Even so, it gives us a new construct to work from, and a new construct is necessary. For decades, most of Israel’s peace negotiations were built around the idea of “land for peace.” But what was successful with Egypt did not work with Syria, and it certainly did not work with Palestine. Israel has both political and security reasons to move away from that formula. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is determined to preserve Israeli communities scattered throughout historic Judea and Samaria, in areas designated for a future Palestinian state. He speaks derisively of the potential emergence of “Hamastan” and “Fatahstan” on Israel’s borders, and he vows to block it. On these issues, there is a fair amount of Israeli unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at the same time, Palestinians look at the fragmented ink blots of “Area A” on the West Bank, supposedly under full Palestinian control yet largely at the mercy of Israeli decisions. Palestinians have come to regard the Oslo agreement of 1993 as a ruse that left them powerless, dominated, and immiserated. Israel’s cordon around Gaza, and its actions over the last three months inside of it, reinforces Palestinians’ despair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rethinking the terms of what a two-state solution might look like will not be satisfying. Each side feels it gave the other a chance through the Oslo Accords, only to see the depth of its adversary’s hostility. Events of the last three months have convinced even more that the other side has no respect for human life. This is no basis on which to build a partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the two sides surely have shared interests, not least the desire to create a future of greater security, prosperity, and freedom for their children. Seventy-five years of fighting has not gotten either side what it wanted. Thinking through ways to enlarge definitions and introduce outside monitors will not end conflict, but it could go a long way to end bloodshed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Unless the United States commits to rigorous diplomacy to resolve conflicts and properly manage crises, especially those like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the United States has unique leverage, these forever wars will spiral.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is awash with seemingly endless conflicts. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict exemplifies the most common variety: a local conflict that simmers with sporadic, unpredictable, and devastating surges in violence. Despite this growing trend, the United States has tried to narrowly focus on great power competition, particularly with China. But just as in the Cold War, those local conflicts are where global competition is most likely to play out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the left and right in the United States have advocated for an end to “forever wars.” But in the sunset of unsuccessful U.S. forays in the Middle East, another kind of forever war is emerging and threatens to affect U.S. interests for the next two decades. Local and civil wars, like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, are dramatically increasing in number, intensity, and length around the world. While 2023 saw the highest number of violent conflicts since World War II, 2022 saw more battlefield deaths than any year since 1994. These crises have nearly tripled in duration since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. foreign policy tends to sidestep the drivers of these conflicts and their discontents. In an effort to downsize its approach to peripheral regions like the Middle East, the United States has instead focused on encouraging deals between strongmen and dealing with crises through increasingly anemic humanitarian aid. Even in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the United States has been an integral actor for decades, the U.S. government has sidelined Palestinians in favor of elite bargains with Arab states, otherwise known as the Abraham Accords. The United States and its Western allies have then dealt with the Palestinians through aid. As seen in the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli offensive on Gaza, the strategy is not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Gaza is the most dramatic example of this failure in 2023, it is hardly the only one. From Yemen and Syria to East Africa, protracted conflicts and fragile states have become vectors for instability. The United States deals with all these protracted crises in a similar way but with even less interest, seeing them as more peripheral or even irrelevant to great power competition. Nevertheless, in many ways these conflicts will challenge the narrow U.S. response to great power competition. The instability they create spills across borders and distracts the United States. The vulnerability inherent in protracted crises allows others to take advantage, and the U.S. response or lack of response provides an avenue for enemies to criticize U.S. hypocrisy or ineptitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reignited conflicts have the power to quickly inflame an unstable region. The escalation in Gaza exemplifies the potential ripple effect of localized violence. As the war in Gaza escalated, the regime under Syrian president Bashar al-Assad stepped up attacks in northwestern Syria, and Iranian-backed militants launched attacks on bases and facilities housing U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria — 130 attacks in under three months — injuring dozens of service members. In a globalized world, local events can quickly have global consequences. Houthi attacks on shipping vessels forced several major shipping lines — representing 60 percent of global trade — and oil giants like BP to suspend their services through the Red Sea. The attacks eventually forced the United States to strike targets in Yemen. Each of these events has its own destabilizing consequences, and all of them are distracting from the issues the U.S. government wants to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ great power competitors also gain from these protracted crises in different ways. Both Russia and China gain from U.S. distraction and redirection of U.S. resources. Russia will gain directly from U.S. efforts to provide military support to Israel as it diverts attention and resources from Ukraine. Putin also gains by directly intervening in many of these local conflicts, which the United States considers less strategic. In Sudan, Russia reaps the benefits of the country’s gold and continues to push for a naval base in the Red Sea. In Syria, Putin’s support for a struggling Assad won Russia an air base and warm-water port to expand its influence in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia are also able to manipulate the United States’ chosen path for managing these crises: aid. For aid workers, China’s support of North Korea and Russia’s support of Syria have made principled and adequate humanitarian responses nearly impossible. As aid workers struggling with aid diversion in North Korea said in 2018, “If China and Russia were not supporting the Kim regime behind the scenes, then . . . foreign aid groups would have much more bargaining power.” In Syria, the Assad regime egregiously diverts aid with little to no accountability as a result of Russia’s protection. China and Russia have since expanded these protections to other states in Africa, making conflict management through humanitarian aid even less feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indirectly, Russia and China gain from arguing the United States is hypocritical and ineffective on the world stage. For many countries in the Global South, support for Ukraine waned because of U.S. double standards in Iraq and Israel. For these countries, the United States’ inconsistent application of norms in the name of national interests excuses them from violating those same rules occasionally. While China and Russia may protect a state’s ability to impede aid and commit violence, for 153 countries at the UN General Assembly, the United States is doing the same for Israel at the UN Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless the United States commits to rigorous diplomacy to resolve conflicts and properly manage crises, especially those like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the United States has unique leverage, these forever wars will spiral. The compounding damage to U.S. interests is likely to be long lasting. To combat it, the U.S. government would do well to view the challenge as Franklin D. Roosevelt saw it in 1941:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We must recognize that the hostilities in Europe, in Africa, and in Asia are all parts of a single world conflict. . . . Our strategy of self-defense must be a global strategy which takes account of every front and takes advantage of every opportunity to contribute to our total security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;War is by its nature disruptive — to life, business, and society. The longer the war, the greater the economic hit. Israel’s tech sector must once again prove resilient enough to recover and reengage with the global economy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tragic toll of Hamas’s October 7 attacks can be counted in lives lost and homes destroyed, but a second-order effect lurks on the horizon: a damaged Israeli economy and a potentially massive disruption to Israel’s tech sector. That tech sector has served as an economic engine for Israel and an innovation engine for the globe. While Israeli tech has weathered recent conflicts well, the extent of this mobilization and a weaker economic context are likely to significantly delay, if not disrupt, Israeli tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workforce disruptions are the main driver of potential economic impact. In response to the October 7 attack, the Israel Defense Forces mobilized 360,000 reservists, approximately 4 percent of Israel’s total population. This marks one of the largest mobilizations in Israel’s history, eclipsed only by the 400,000 reservists called up during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In contrast, Israel’s most significant recent mobilizations were the 2014 Gaza War, with 75,000 reservists, and the 2006 Second Lebanon War, with 89,000 reservists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dent in the workforce is far greater than the call-up of reserves: at the height of the disruption, this conflict removed an estimated 764,000 Israelis, or 18 percent of the total workforce, between reserve mobilization, evacuations near the Gazan and Lebanese borders, and school closures requiring parental care at home. Recent estimates suggest that as of December, an estimated 500,000 Israelis, or 12 percent of the workforce, are still not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mobilization has likely hit tech start-ups harder than average, given staff at start-ups skew young and much of Israel’s tech sector sprang out of skills gained in service with the IDF. According to a survey conducted by Start-Up Nation Policy Institute (SNPI), an estimated 15–20 percent of tech sector employees were mobilized, and 25 percent of company respondents reported experiencing a shortage of personnel. According to Avi Eyal of Entrée Capital, 10–30 percent of start-up employees mobilized, representing a substantial reduction in staff and a prolonged break in innovation, project development, and client servicing. Start-ups tend to operate on a skeleton staff, making them less resilient to prolonged staff disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech disruption will have an outsize impact on Israel’s economy. Israel’s tech sector represents around 18–20 percent of GDP in contrast to 9.3 percent in the United States and 6 percent in the European Union. High-tech products constitute around 50 percent of Israel’s exports. Further, foreign direct investment in the Israeli tech sector is critical, and much of that funding may be in peril. As of late October, approximately 40 percent of surveyed tech firms experienced disruptions in their financing efforts, with many investment agreements either canceled or placed on hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the labor gap is temporary and the reservists demobilize in weeks rather than months, some disruptions may be irreparable. A recent Israel Innovation Authority and SNPI survey revealed more than 70 percent of start-ups surveyed delayed or abandoned new orders and projects. This was primarily due to challenges in conducting pilots and clinical trials, progressing research and development initiatives, and exporting and importing essential products. Those disruptions are on top of signs the sector was already weakening following Israel’s domestic political unrest. Reports from December indicate Israeli start-ups only raised $1.3 billion between October and December, a 46 percent drop from the same time the year before, marking a new six-year low in Israeli start-up funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall economic impact could be double that of previous conflicts. The Bank of Israel has determined the 2014 Gaza War reduced Israel’s GDP by 0.4 percent, and the Second Lebanon War by 0.5 percent. The estimate for the current conflict is 0.7 percent for 2023. In December, the Bank of Israel once again revised downward the growth projections for 2024, from 3 percent before October 7 to 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, advances like using the cloud to deliver products have made Israeli tech more resilient, and recent history suggests a bounce back is possible. In 2014 tech bounced back robustly as venture capital investments steadily increased from $2.9 billion in 2014 to $5.6 billion in 2016. But just as the conflict in 2014 was different from that in 2023, the world economy has also changed. Bloomberg predicted an escalation in the conflict — like recent Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea — could send global oil prices soaring. Global growth could drop to 1.7 percent, an estimated $1 trillion off global output. The global economy is still feeling the effects of a war in Ukraine, monetary policy is tighter, and there is continuing uncertainty surrounding the multitude of elections in 2024. Conditions will be more challenging for a quick bounce back this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel is wisely acting fast to bolster the tech sector. As of early January, the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) had begun to deploy $100 million in emergency aid for start-ups. The New York Times reported that chip giant Intel announced it would proceed with a planned $25 billion investment to expand a factory in southern Israel, having received a $3.2 billion grant from the government. For the economy more broadly, Israel has slowly tried to fill the labor gap by increasing the number of foreign workers in the country, with more than 12,000 foreign workers arriving as of December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War is by its nature disruptive — to life, business, and society. The longer the war, the greater the economic hit. Israel’s tech sector must once again prove resilient enough to recover and reengage with the global economy. It is telling the world it is ready to do just that. Early in the conflict, the IIA started a new campaign with this tag line: “Israeli tech delivers. NO MATTER WHAT.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;張劍虹認警員赴收押所探訪數小時 翌日突表示願做控方證人 辯方質疑被游說&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/f4ozB3M.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（1日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第21日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。辯方盤問時透露，2021年11月一名警署警長到荔枝角收押所要求會見張，會面長達約6小時。翌日該警長連同另一名偵緝警員再度造訪，而張在該次會面中突然提出有說話想向警方講，以及想成為控方證人。其後張轉換律師代表，並去信律政司表達意願。辯方質疑，警長游說張做控方證人，惟張否認，堅稱會面純粹談論荔枝角的生活和運動。他又補充：「因為我睇完個判詞之後，自己開始去諗，想講返個事實出嚟囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方透露警署警長到收押所會見張劍虹-長達6小時&quot;&gt;辯方透露警署警長到收押所會見張劍虹 長達6小時&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，張劍虹於2021年11月5日向高院申請保釋，即日遭法官李素蘭拒絕，而拒絕保釋理由於11月10日以書面形式頒布。至11月11日，一名警署警長前往荔枝角羈押所探訪張劍虹，並把書面判詞送達給張劍虹。張確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指根據紀錄，當天警長與張於荔枝角會面長達6小時。張表示不太記得該次會面歷時多久，只記得「係好耐啦」。辯方追問，是否由早上10時直至下午4時？張表示大概是，因為當日早上約10時親友探訪完畢，「之後有人通知我有警察嚟搵我」，會面中間沒有午飯時間，會見完才返回監倉吃飯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方質疑，一份只有10頁紙的判決理由書，警署警長理應不需要很長時間解釋。張則表示警長沒有替他解釋該理由書，乃由他自行閱讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹確認向警方提出有說話想講及想做控方證人-之後轉換律師代表&quot;&gt;張劍虹確認向警方提出「有說話想講」及想做控方證人 之後轉換律師代表&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指11月12日，警長再度前往荔枝角收押所會見張，並且聯同另一名偵緝警員8315。辯方指，張在偵緝警員8315面前，突然表示他有說話想向警方講，以及想成為控方證人。張確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，此後張辭退原本的事務律師行羅拔臣（同為黎智英的代表律師行），然後聘用新的事務律師行，而新的律師代表於12月16日去信律政司，指稱警方邀請張出任控方證人。張僅稱：「呢個我唔清楚。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示律師行信件，當中張的律師代表透露，經公務探訪和索取當事人指示後，律師得悉警方邀請張出任控方證人，而張確認若果控方有需要的話，他會準備做控方證人及向控方提供協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方質疑，張此前一直在警署錄影會面保持緘默，但在2021年11月12日會見警員之後，卻決定出任控方證人。在法官李運騰的澄清下，張確認該些錄影會面是在他未被落案起訴之前進行的，而他當時正行使緘默權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹稱與警會面數小時僅談論荔枝角生活-辯方質疑警游說做控方證人&quot;&gt;張劍虹稱與警會面數小時僅談論荔枝角生活 辯方質疑警游說做控方證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問張，警署警長有否游說他做控方證人，張說：「冇。」辯方追問，在如此長時間的面談中，張與警員談論了什麼。張表示：「喺荔枝角嘅生活呀、運動呀嗰啲嘢，都係嗰啲普通嘢，冇乜嘢。」辯方遂質疑，雙方花了數個小時，僅僅談論關於張在荔枝角的生活？張確認：「係，主要係講呢啲嘢。」辯方再問，警署警長並非張的朋友，當時雙方僅第一次見面，張同意。他補充：「因為我睇完個判詞之後，自己開始去諗，想講返個事實出嚟囉。但我冇同嗰個警員講我呢個諗法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提議，張決定做控方證人，是因為警署警長的說話，問張是否同意。張斷言否認：「唔同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹確認撰寫誓章時相信蘋果合法地營運&quot;&gt;張劍虹確認撰寫誓章時相信《蘋果》合法地營運&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方昨日提到張劍虹向高院申請保釋時，向法庭提交了一份誓章。辯方今再展示誓章內容，張當時稱相信《蘋果日報》會持續合法地營運下去，而黎智英被捕之後，高層明白難以完全釋除員工疑慮，他只能盡量提醒員工謹慎和不要情緒化。張又指，若果員工因工作關係而面對法律程序，壹傳媒集團會提供法律援助，但張當時認為可能性不大。張確認上述是當時信念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於張在全體員工大會發言稱：「唔代表我哋褪軚，《蘋果日報》冇褪軚空間」，他在誓章中解釋意思是指《蘋果》會繼續如常運作，核心價值和信念原則不變。辯方問張在撰寫誓章時是否相信，《蘋果》一直合法地營運，不曾違反法律，而且所持守的核心價值和原則是完全合法（perfectly lawful）。張確認，並稱當時提醒同事工作時盡量不要情緒化。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英被起訴還柙後-高層將黎的敏感文章和影片下架&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英被起訴還柙後 高層將黎的敏感文章和影片下架&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又提到，在國安法生效之前，他們「一路以嚟按住黎生嘅指示去做」；國安法生效之後，「黎生一直表示佢唔驚，會繼續去抗爭啦，所以佢開咗Live Chat，繼續講佢要講嘅嘢」，惟一眾管理層員工都很擔心國安法的影響，於是成立一些國安法應變群組、舉辦法律座談會，希望在紅線之內去工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，直至黎於2020年12月被正式落案控告國安法及還柙之後，他們便將黎的敏感文章和影片都下架，「至到我講呢番說話時（撰寫誓章內容），一路都希望蘋果日報做緊嘅嘢係合符法律嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問是否核心價值和信念不變，但行動會隨時勢改變，例如有些文章在國安法之前不違法，但在國安法生效之後便要下架。張確認，並指戴耀廷和黎智英涉及國安法的文章均有下架。張特別提到，不過即使國安法生效，黎生的「成敗樂一笑」專欄文章和Live Chat 影片，「我哋冇辦法將佢哋下架，因為佢係老闆嘅文章吖嘛。」他又說：「我哋冇辦法去阻止黎生去發表成敗樂一笑同Live Chat影片嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問，黎首次被捕直至被正式控告期間，其專欄文章和Live Chat影片是否仍然可以在《蘋果》網站見到？張確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指國安法生效後-編採政策有重大轉變-避免觸犯國安法&quot;&gt;辯方指國安法生效後 編採政策有重大轉變 避免觸犯國安法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官再問，在國安法生效前後，編採政策有沒有任何改變？張表示「唔會有咩好大改變」。不過，辯方則指編採政策有重大改變，因任何文章和影片都不能違反國安法，問張是否同意。張僅表示當時不太清楚「紅線喺邊」，所以記憶中編採政策上轉變不是很大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但張亦指曾經舉辦內部法律座談會，並轉述律師講過，若報導有人上街持「光時」旗，只要不是提出主張，便沒有問題。他同意辯方所指，相關政策是為了盡量避免違反國安法，不過他認為黎智英的專欄文章和Live Chat節目則由其本人決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹過往兩度涉藐視法庭程序-事後舉辦員工內部法律座談會&quot;&gt;張劍虹過往兩度涉藐視法庭程序 事後舉辦員工內部法律座談會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續引述誓章內容，當中張否認參與串謀犯罪計劃之中，也表明從來無意作出危害國家安全的行為。張確認，但亦承認他在資深大律師和法律團隊的代表下，早前已經承認了控罪。他又確認其法律代表來自一間受人敬重的律師行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;誓章另外提到，張過往曾兩度牽涉藐視法庭程序，他解釋事後有作出補救措施，包括舉辦員工內部法律座談會，以防止同類事件再次發生。辯方指，上述做法與因應國安法而舉辦座談會相似，均為了避免觸犯法律。張同意。被問到這做法有否獲得黎的支持和認可，張表示：「有架呢個。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，《蘋果日報》在2013年大角嘴夫婦被肢解一案進入法律程序後，派出記者到監獄採訪夫婦的兒子、疑兇周凱亮，並刊登報導，當時擔任總編輯的張劍虹承認藐視法庭。《壹週刊》於1997年在一宗有陪審團的民事訴訟案件期間，刊出有關律師費的報導，被指可能造成審訊不公，當時張任職《壹傳媒》總編輯，承認藐視法庭罪。兩案均被判罰款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱報導大陸負面新聞-是為了促進透明度和改善管治&quot;&gt;辯方稱報導大陸負面新聞 是為了促進透明度和改善管治&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示WhatsApp 群組「Index」對話，群組成員只得黎智英、張劍虹和筆名盧峯的馮偉光。2020年7月10日紀錄顯示，黎智英談及有關大陸的報導不是去「踢爆」，而是透過大數據去找出問題，然後「以數據事實糾正」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指由此可見，《蘋果》報導有關大陸的負面新聞，目的是為了促進中國政府透明度和改善管治。惟張不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎智英沒有說過做到俾人冚為止-張否認&quot;&gt;辯方：黎智英沒有說過「做到俾人冚為止」 張否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張昨日提及，2021年4月底到獄中探訪黎時，他曾向黎提及員工擔心《蘋果》會「過唔到七一」，並請示黎，黎當時回應：「點解要自己執咗佢？不如做到俾人冚為止啦。」張今確認該次探訪中，同場還有黎的兩名兒子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指出，黎根本沒有說過該番說話。張不同意，堅稱黎有說過。他又憶述黎另外吩咐他，叫行政總監黃偉強將黎私人掛在公司的黃永玉畫作搬走，「因為黎生話呢啲畫係值錢嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問張知不知道，自2021年3月起，黎已開始就應否關閉壹傳媒旗下的不同子公司，積極地咨詢董事局意見。張表示沒印象，僅記得黎在2021年2月或之前指示過要處理台灣《蘋果日報》的虧損。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指出，黎智英與張劍虹及所有同事之間，從來沒有一個串謀犯罪計劃去發布煽動性文章，問張是否同意。張表示「唔同意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While considerable attention has been paid to how unwanted Russian actions in the maritime domain can be deterred, less has been paid to the maritime contribution to deterrence more broadly defined. The authors argue that this is a gap in the literature that needs to be filled, since the maritime domain remains an area of overwhelming Allied advantage. The function of this paper is to contribute to discussions of how actions at sea can translate into strategic effects on land in the context of the European theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s application of maritime power can better translate into strategic effects with three subtle changes: firstly, through the creation of an environment that forces Russia to expend resources on capabilities needed to deny the open ocean to NATO navies; secondly, the employment of maritime forces can serve as a war termination tool by increasing the costs of a protracted conflict in tandem with ground forces, which deny short-term gains; and finally, because many of the platforms which Russia employs for sub-strategic nuclear use are either maritime or, like strategic bombers, can be impacted from the sea with conventional capabilities, a maritime threat to the bulk of Russia’s sub-strategic launch capability can considerably alter perceptions of a favourable strategic balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper outlines a strategy for how Allied maritime power could be employed to create costly capability requirements for Russia, in order to offset the country’s competitive edge in other domains. The paper’s key findings are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia views the maritime domain as critical to the strategic balance – in other words, the capacity to both strike an adversary’s homeland and deflect strikes on Russia itself. Its view of the role of its navy is one that de-emphasises purely naval functions such as seizing sea control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The capabilities that Russia needs to perform both functions are among those which it will find most difficult to generate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By investing in maritime capabilities such as long-range precision strike and operating at a higher tempo on Russia’s extended periphery, the members of NATO can impose opportunity costs on Russia’s military. Investments in deflecting Allied maritime power will prove unavoidable for Russia, and will divert critical resources from its recapitalisation of other joint capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO should, however, recognise its own shortfalls, including the subset of challenges related to military capacity. Firstly, capabilities needed to compete effectively with the Russian Federation in the medium term will be required in a 10-year timeframe, which is shorter than procurement times for most major programmes. The second likely concern is a lack of platforms to hold strike assets, and this also needs to be mitigated. In addition, different approaches to anti-submarine warfare could expand the threat envelope for opponents and mitigate the Alliance’s own potential shortfalls in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the question in each instance will be whether the capabilities developed will impose more costs than those required to develop them in the first place. It is conceivable that even marginal investments in the areas described will impose disproportionately costly adaptations on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sources informing this paper included desk research on Allied and Russian capabilities, as well as an examination of Russian military literature to identify areas where Russian authors perceive their nation to be vulnerable in the maritime domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of how Allied maritime power should be employed against a continental rival spurred considerable debate during the Cold War. Some saw the maritime preponderance of the Alliance as an asymmetrical advantage which might be used to offset Soviet advantages on the ground. Others, by contrast, emphasised the centrality of deterrence through denial against the Red Army, which remained the sword arm of Soviet power (as Russian ground forces remain to this day), and contended that the primary function of maritime power should be to contain Russian threats to sea lines of communication at chokepoints such as the Greenland–Iceland–UK (GIUK) Gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the Russian challenge bears certain similarities with, though is not identical to, that posed by the USSR. Russia remains primarily a land power with a more limited capacity for power projection at sea. This having been said, the Russian navy, officially known as the Military Maritime Fleet (Voyenno-Morskoi Flot, or VMF), does play an important role in Russia’s overarching approach to competition and conflict. In competition, the VMF is expected to support limited power projection, as it did in Syria through the provision of logistical lift and long-range precision strikes. As competition escalates, the VMF plays three core roles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limiting the threat to the Russian homeland and in particular its defence industry, command and control (C2) nodes and nuclear-capable platforms. The VMF is expected to achieve this both through an active effort to disrupt threats from the maritime direction at reach and with a layered defence close to Russian shores.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conducting long-range conventional strikes against the territory of hostile states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintaining a portion of Russia’s tactical and strategic nuclear throw-weight&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, the Russian state views the sea as critical to shaping the strategic balance within which general purpose forces are used. Rather than naval combat per se, the purpose of Russian sea power is to ensure that the Russian state can compete and engage in conflict safely and effectively. To be sure, this is by no means the only function of Russian sea power, but it is central and has been demonstrated in the use of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in the ongoing conflict with Ukraine. In Ukraine, the key contributions of the Black Sea Fleet – long-range Kalibr strikes and an ongoing blockade – are not central to Russia’s goal of destroying the Ukrainian army (though strikes can contribute to missions such as interdiction). What the fleet has contributed, however, is a level of economic damage that will shape both Ukraine’s capacity to confront Russia in the long term and its post-war stability. With its deployment in the Mediterranean before the war, the fleet was likely intended to act in a deterrent role vis-à-vis NATO by serving both as a tripwire and a symbol. In effect, its role has been not to secure sea control, but to provide strategic shaping for land forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of both the new Strategic Concept and the Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area framework, how should Allied maritime power best reinforce the goals set out for NATO, which focus on reinforcing the Alliance’s capacity for territorial defence within Europe and the more broadly defined growing competition with Russia? The assertion of this paper is that the focus can, in principle, be on committing Russia to an unsustainable posture in the maritime domain that detracts from its more lethal land aspirations. The Alliance has avenues through which, by exacerbating pervasive Russian fears regarding threats in the maritime domain, it can both reinforce general deterrence and force the VMF to adapt in ways that impose opportunity costs on it in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core function of Allied maritime power, though by no means an exclusive one, can be its use as a means of shaping Russian perceptions of the strategic balance, as opposed to the military balance. (The latter might be understood as the ability to impact targets of critical national significance at depth, as distinct from fielded forces.) Specifically, by shaping Russian leaders’ perceptions of the relative risks involved in escalation, as well as the conditions under which war termination would occur, maritime power can complement an overarching strategic focus on both competition and deterrence by denial. Rather than contributing directly to denial, the function of maritime power would be indirect – by forcing Russia to commit to its own defences in the maritime domain, it would divert critical Russian resources to tasks that the Alliance deems less threatening. Furthermore, in a crisis or a conflict, this would complement deterrence by denial. Denial has the primary role of preventing an opponent from achieving an outcome rapidly and, while important, in a conflict this merely sets the conditions for war termination to be achieved by other means. Failing this, an opponent that is initially frustrated can double down on its objectives, particularly if it perceives there to be avenues by which it can win through exhaustion. A case in point would be Russia’s ongoing conflict in Ukraine, where, upon being frustrated in its initial approach, Russia shifted to a strategy of attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach outlined above is comparable to the Allied maritime strategies adopted in the late 1980s, in terms of their strategic logic of identifying and playing on existing Russian fears, and their emphasis on maritime power as a tool of war termination. However, a different set of tools can be employed operationally to obviate some of the challenges inherent in replicating this strategy today, among them the difficulty of operating forward in defended bastions, particularly with current submarine numbers, and the escalatory risks of doing so. At the operational level, Allied maritime power will be most effective if it is capable of delivering effects at reach and if it can complicate some of the challenges that Russia faces with respect to engaging dynamic targets. This is distinct from the maritime strategy of the 1980s, which envisioned operating as closely as possible to defended Russian bastions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, a core function of Allied maritime power ought not to be deterrence by denial but the diversion of Russian capability and the cultivation of a favourable strategic balance. Though this can serve the overarching goal of general deterrence, it is distinct from deterrence understood as the use of specific threats or instruments to dissuade specific actions. The authors argue that this framing can usefully act as a baseline through which the employment of Allied capabilities in theatres such as the High North can be contextualised, as well as a means of better understanding the interrelationships between the individual regions which collectively form the maritime periphery of European NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this paper, the authors utilise a combination of methods to validate their argument, which includes an analysis of Russian military journals to ascertain where Russian officers perceive themselves to be facing capability gaps, as well as research into the capabilities that Russia and the Alliance currently field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-enduring-russian-threat&quot;&gt;The Enduring Russian Threat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia will, in all likelihood, pose a limited conventional threat to the Alliance for up to a decade, due both to its losses and to its ongoing commitments in Ukraine, this could change once the country has reconstituted its land forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, it was reported that the Russian state would allocate 40% of its federal budget to defence, and the Russian regime intended to increase the size of its army by 400,000 recruits. While it remains to be seen whether the Russian state is capable of sustaining an increased rate of military expenditure over the medium to long term, it should be noted that there is limited historical evidence for the argument that it cannot do so. States facing considerable economic pressures have nonetheless maintained levels of spending that, proportionately speaking, match Russia’s: Iran, for example, maintained a defence budget which represented 4–5% of its GDP over the course of the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign. Indeed, even during the 1990s, Russia itself typically spent at least 3% of its GDP on defence for most of the decade. It is therefore plausible that Russia will maintain its current levels of military expenditure, representing around 5% of its GDP, in the face of economic circumstances which, though negative and characterised by sluggish forecasted growth, are not nearly as bad as those of the 1990s, with the country’s GDP falling by 45% between 1989 and 1998. For Europe, this creates the challenge of deterring a competitor which, though it remains plagued by qualitative inefficiencies, can generate and replace forces at a scale which European nations will presently struggle to match – a challenge which will become more acute as the US has to allocate an ever-growing proportion of its resources to competition with a peer competitor in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of a larger, if less sophisticated, Russian threat on the ground could coincide with a greater emphasis on the use of nuclear brinkmanship as a tool of statecraft. While there has been no explicit shift in Russian nuclear policy, statements both by figures within the regime, such as Nikolai Patrushev, and by academics, such as Sergei Karaganov, suggest that this is at least being debated. Certainly, there is precedent for this – Russia’s 2000 nuclear doctrine for example, conceived of a large set of scenarios to which nuclear weapons could be relevant. Moreover, as the US grapples with extended nuclear deterrence against two nuclear peers by 2030, the nuclear balance underpinning existing Western deterrence will have shifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is thus not inconceivable (though admittedly not certain) that in a decade, Russia will pose a renewed conventional threat backed by an arsenal that is sufficiently large and diversified to be able to provide it with flexible nuclear options that the Alliance lacks. Alternatively, Russia might opt for a strategic posture not unlike that which nations such as North Korea and Pakistan opted for in the face of conventional overmatch: combining aggressive sub-threshold competition with the use of nuclear weapons as a backstop against escalation to a conventional war that Russia cannot win. Russia might base a future force posture around sub-kiloton nuclear weapons which are less likely to trigger a strategic nuclear exchange if used. In this eventuality, Russia could combine brinkmanship within Europe and destabilisation on NATO’s southern flank to pressure the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reconstitution of NATO’s own forces to meet the requirements of both deterrence and competition within this context will be shaped by relative uncertainty about the contours of Russia’s own trajectory. This paper, supported by the Royal Navy Strategic Studies Centre, seeks to answer a subordinate strategic question – what should the role be of the Alliance’s navies in strategic competition with Russia? The answer to this question will shape the contours of how both the Royal Navy and navies within NATO will evolve in the face of what could well be a long-term Russian threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors propose that, irrespective of its trajectory, Russia is likely to rely on its assets in the maritime domain for two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shaping the strategic balance, defined in Russian thinking as the relative throw-weight in both conventional and nuclear terms that two nations or alliances can deliver against each other’s homelands. In Russian parlance strategic forces are treated as distinct from general purpose (military) forces, though some capabilities, like ballistic missiles, can play both roles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Holding adversary maritime platforms capable of carrying long-range strike capabilities at reach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this mirrors Cold War thinking about the maritime domain as being integrally intertwined with the nuclear balance. In the post-Cold War era, however, Russian leaders (including President Putin) have evinced a belief that many tasks which were previously only achievable with nuclear weapons can now be achieved with conventional precision-strike assets. Since long-range theatre-level strike assets (and kinetic defences against them) are easiest to move on large vessels, they remain a largely (though not exclusively) maritime capability in both Russia and the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A considerable body of literature exists to suggest that perceptions of the strategic balance influence coercive dynamics across the spectrum of competition. Moreover, to the extent that many of Russia’s most viable pathways to generating a credible future force structure rest on a favourable strategic balance, a threat to this would at a minimum require adaptation by Russia. Since many of the plausible adaptations for which Russia could opt are inherently capital intensive, this will impose resource trade-offs on Russian planners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In view of this, the authors contend that one of the primary vectors through which naval forces can deliver competitive overmatch regarding Russia is by fielding long-range land attack capabilities against which Russia will have to field additional defences. If this is combined with multiple launch vectors, the cost and expense of defence will undercut Russia’s potential future force designs and compel it to implement a series of force design choices that are counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, what this paper is proposing is that the navies of NATO play a role in a modern variant of flexible response. Part of the solution to the Alliance’s deterrence requirements will be recapitalising the ground forces that represent a key pillar of deterrence on the Alliance’s eastern flank. The defence plans of nations such as Poland, which include the purchase of both the Korean K239 Chunmoo multiple-launch rocket system and the US-made M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, stand out as a case in point. However, it is worth noting that the success of such plans will be contingent on the maintenance of stores of munitions and spares, as well as the ability of Alliance members to crew equipment. Maintaining the political capital to deliver equipment to forces on a sustained basis is a challenge within democracies, even in the face of acute threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime forces can play three important roles in this context. First, in peacetime, their employment can impose a requirement on Russia to expend resources on capabilities needed to deny the open ocean to NATO navies. This is viewed as a pressing requirement for the VMF and Russian aerospace forces, but one for which they have limited resources. Secondly, the employment of maritime forces can serve as a war termination tool by increasing the risks attendant on a protracted conflict in tandem with ground forces, which deny short-term gains. Finally, because many of the platforms which Russia employs for both strategic and sub-strategic nuclear use are either maritime or, like strategic bombers, can be impacted from the sea with conventional capabilities, a maritime threat to the bulk of Russia’s sub-strategic launch capability could considerably alter perceptions of a favourable strategic balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, this does not represent the full spectrum of functions which maritime power can play – the roles of navies can encompass a range of tasks, such as containing rival navies and providing armies with strategic mobility. This paper is more narrowly focused on those areas where maritime power can be applied asymmetrically as an offset to an opponent’s potential advantages in other areas, and as a tool for generating competitive advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main hypothesis of this paper is that in order to impose an asymmetry of cost on Russia, as well as to reinforce deterrence, Allied maritime power should not be framed in terms of deterrence by denial. Rather, its role should be viewed in terms of the strategic functions of pre-war shaping and war termination in the event that deterrence fails. Central to this will be two things: the ability to strike inland at reach; and the capacity to exacerbate Russia’s challenges with respect to generating ISR, and operating and contesting in the maritime domain beyond its coastal defensive zones. Underpinning the proposed approach to the employment of Allied maritime power is a focus on adversary concerns, rather than an effort to match capabilities. This is drawn from the tradition of competitive strategies innovated by figures such as Andrew Marshall at the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment in the 1970s. This paper discusses how Allied planning for the use of maritime power in the context of European deterrence can be placed within the context of a competitive strategies framework. This is distinct from threat-based planning insofar as it takes as its starting point the assumption that adversary investments can be shaped rather than merely countered. Secondly, given its long-term focus, a perspective based on competitive strategies emphasises exploiting asymmetry, exacerbating bottlenecks in an opponent’s capabilities rather than overmatching specific military threats directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is composed of four chapters, each of which will build towards a broad set of proposed lines of action for NATO navies. Chapter I focuses on Russia’s views of the primary threats that it faces from the maritime domain, and the opportunities that might emerge from a closer integration of these fears into Allied and national planning. Chapter II focuses on naval dynamics on NATO’s northern flank as a case study. Chapters III and IV examine the emerging opportunities for Allied planning in this area and the practical impediments – in both capability and policy terms – to the adoption of a “competitive strategies” approach to the application of Allied maritime power in competition with Russia, as well as the ways in which these might be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors reviewed a combination of sources, including Russian military literature and academic analysis of the maritime balance between NATO and Russia, as part of their research for this paper. In addition, one of the authors has direct experience of operating in two different navies within the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-russian-threats-and-allied-opportunities&quot;&gt;I. Russian Threats and Allied Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia views itself as possessing some opportunities within the maritime domain, Russian strategists tend to frame it as a threat vector. This is relatively understandable given the country’s traditional weaknesses in this domain. Broadly speaking, Russian literature evinces several potential concerns within the maritime domain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of the maritime domain as a launch vector for adversary long-range precision fires against the Russian homeland.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efforts by rivals to challenge Russia’s ability to exploit its resource base within the maritime domain, particularly in the High North and Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Threats to Russia’s second-strike strategic nuclear capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first concern can be nested within a broader set of Russian concerns regarding the risk of a precision-strike campaign against the Russian homeland conducted on multiple axes. The fear that Russia could effectively be paralysed by Western long-range precision strike capabilities emerged partially as the result of a specific reading of the conflicts of the 1990s. A key lesson of the first Gulf War and the Balkan Wars derived by figures such as the then Soviet deputy chief of general staff of the armed forces, General Makhmut Gareev, and the deputy commander of the Soviet Navy, Admiral Ivan Kapitanets, was the notion that precision strike made it possible to paralyse a state’s capacity to mount an effective military response by simultaneously targeting the depth of an opponent’s territory. Though not an exclusively naval function, it has been assumed by several Russian strategists that naval platforms will represent a crucial launch vector for the long-range precision strike threat. This is a reasonable assumption, as the size of missiles such as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) makes launching them from platforms other than naval more complex (though not impossible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain maritime platforms also have a second advantage which is of particular concern to Russian military writers: their capacity to launch strikes at close range, which would leave Russia with limited early warning. This specific threat is of course particular to certain types of launch platforms such as SSN and SSGN submarines, which can, in principle, remain undetected and strike from positions close to Russian shores at short notice. The present Russian concern regarding air and missile threats mirrors those voiced during the Soviet era, when genuine concerns about being subjected to a nuclear first strike were compounded by inter-organisational dynamics. A combination of factors contributed to this, among them the strategic culture, which created pervasive fears of surprise attack, and organisational dynamics within the USSR that saw organisations such as the Soviet Air Defence Forces competing for resources, which they could do more effectively when they could make the case that an external threat justified their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary Russian thinking about an aerospace assault is somewhat broader and assumes simultaneous strikes against C2 nodes, critical infrastructure airfields and nuclear assets. Russian theorists presume that the launch of missiles moving at different speeds, such as UAV decoys and cruise missiles, can be sequenced to provide a coordinated time on top or convergent effect. This is certainly technically achievable – Russia has coordinated the use of Shahed-136 loitering munitions and Kalibr cruise missiles in this way, and Iran combined cruise missiles and UAVs in its 2019 strikes on Abqaiq and Khurais.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, then, priorities such as air defence have featured heavily in recent Russian procurement. For example, under the state armament programme for 2020, the Russian Federation was expected to procure 56 S-400 division sets, which, at a cost of $200 million per battery, would be comparable to a carrier programme. Moreover, Russia has placed an ever-greater emphasis on building and fielding the precision strike capabilities needed to conduct offensive counter-air missions against targets such as airbases. This has been combined with efforts to recapitalise Russia’s capacity for airborne situational awareness in areas such as the High North. In addition to deploying assets such as the MiG-31BM to the region, Russia maintains at least three S-300 and S-400 regiments under its Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command, along with the Murmansk-BN electronic warfare complex and a growing radar network in areas such as Kotelny (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bMq9i3s.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second major Russian concern which emerges primarily from the maritime domain is the fear that Russia’s SSBN bastions can be penetrated. This was an especially pressing consideration for the Soviet Union during the late Cold War, and drove considerable investments in securing the USSR’s bastions in the High North. Today, factors such as the melting of polar ice caps that will allow greater access to the area will exacerbate this concern, as the growth in merchant traffic is likely to mask any increased military presence, making it more difficult for Russia to produce its recognised maritime picture and deter would-be ingressors into its historical bastions. This issue has been noted by, among others, Admiral Nikolai Yemenov, commander-in-chief of the VMF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of Russia to maintain situational awareness in the undersea domain represents another bottleneck in capacity and capability. Much of the responsibility for the task of maintaining sub-surface domain awareness falls to the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research (Glavnoye Upravlenie Glubokovodnikh Issledovanii, or GUGI). This organisation has historically depended on a highly specialised cadre of hydronauts for its operations, drawn from the ranks of the VMF via the 29th Separate Submarine brigade. It also relies on several special purpose submarines, such as the deep-diving submarine Losharik, which is launched from the Belgorod, a specially adapted stretched Oscar-class submarine. Under the leadership of Vice-Admiral Aleksei Burilichev, the GUGI took on several additional tasks, including the testing of the Poseidon nuclear torpedo. On the one hand, this represented a budgetary advantage, but it simultaneously represented a cost in terms of both submariners’ time and the use of its platforms. Currently, the organisation likely faces more tasks than its platforms and personnel can manage, with its duties including undersea surveillance, the management of Harmony (Russia’s analogue to the US Integrated Undersea Surveillance System), and more offensive functions such as espionage. This strain on availability of platforms was further compounded by a 2019 fire on the Losharik. Russia’s current emphasis on less survivable but also less costly platforms, such as the intelligence ship Yantar, and the search for autonomous solutions, may reflect these challenges. These approaches could bear fruit, but capabilities such as autonomous underwater vehicles are likely to demand investments in areas such as high-end microelectronics, which Russia can only procure at cost and at some sanctions risk to vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the risk of a distant blockade of the Russian Federation’s maritime lines of communication, which will be exacerbated by the use of “grey” shipping that can be legally interdicted in peacetime for lack of adequate insurance or flag verification, among other things. Russia is in some ways especially vulnerable to blockade. Its trade-to-GDP ratio is currently higher than that of most Western nations, and the majority of this trade is carried by sea. Though land-based infrastructure and transhipment through neutral ports can mitigate this vulnerability to an extent, it can do so only inefficiently and, moreover, at a cost in both money and material. For example, a proposed North–South Corridor moving Russian goods to the Indian Ocean via Iran would both be a high-risk investment (which is why it must be state-backed) and involve goods passing through volatile regions and states such as Azerbaijan, with which both Russia and Iran have a fraught relationship. Some Russian authors have voiced concerns that the Russian state’s increasing reliance on grey shipping will create vulnerabilities to peacetime interdiction. In a conflict scenario, much of Russia’s energy exports, among other things, will depend on sea lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the need to meet requirements such as protecting bastions and sea lines of communication, as well as contributing to objectives such as offensive counter-air missions, the VMF has secured a sizeable proportion of Russia’s defence budget over the last decades: it received a 26% allocation under the last state armament plan, as compared to 14% for ground forces. Despite this fiscal allocation, the ability of Russia’s ageing maritime sector to meet the demands placed on it is in question. The recent budget announcement that more than a third of Russia’s total budget expenditure in 2024 will go to defence will not ease this, as the main emphasis of this increase is focused on the delivery of victory in Ukraine, meaning that predominantly the land environment and the Army will benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-trade-offs-facing-russia&quot;&gt;The Trade-Offs Facing Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some challenges are easier for Russia to mitigate than others. While Russia can achieve sea denial and a degree of sea control in its coastal seas, contesting freedom of action out to 1,000 km and beyond will be difficult and costly for a country that must also rebuild its forces on land. For example, Russia has struggled to build its Pion and Lotos satellite constellations and thus has limited situational awareness at reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue for Russia is twofold. First, as previously noted, platform development in the maritime domain is inherently capital intensive, and this is especially true for those platforms that are needed to contest more distant waters. While it is difficult to ascertain the costs of platforms such as the Ilyushin Il-38 aircraft or the Yasen-class submarine with a high degree of certainty (though public figures do exist for the Yasen), proxy indicators can be utilised. For example, during the Cold War the CIA used a methodology which focused on the relative costs of platforms, rather than on their absolute costs. Essentially, the relative production cost of two different systems was established using Western analogues. Though imperfect, the assumption underpinning this mode of comparison was that while the absolute costs of two different platforms might vary across states, the relative costs were more stable and dependant on physical characteristics such as tonnage and power density (for vessels) or factors such as weight and speed (for aircraft), and because factors such as labour costs that might impact absolute costs would not impact relative costs. Using this rubric, the costs of the platforms needed for Russia to contest areas beyond its immediate close seas are prohibitive. For example, a Yasen-class submarine should cost roughly as much as the armour organic to a force such as the First Guards Tank Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second factor worth considering is how much a given system depends on foreign inputs, including machine tooling and microelectronics. In this case, there is likely to be a direct correlation between the reach of a platform or effector and its dependence on imports. Effectors such as long-range missiles depend on Western inputs to achieve precision at reach. Similarly, the larger the platform, the more it is likely to require in terms of resources such as machine tooling, much of which is imported. Estimating sophistication is a relatively imprecise art, though more is now known about the degree to which certain effectors (in particular missiles) rely on Western capabilities. One proxy, borrowed from civilian economics, is to use the average GDP of countries that produce a given product as a barometer of its sophistication and thus its reliance on high-tech imports if the country producing the product falls below the average. The percentage of industrial capacity in areas where Russia has external dependencies on which a given area of military spending draws is another measure which can be employed. By these metrics, capabilities such as SSNs, strategic bombers, long-range strike capabilities and air defence systems are all likely to be demanding in terms of external inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintenance costs are another area of interest. During the Cold War it was presumed (correctly) that the poor quality of Soviet aircraft maintenance meant that the through-life costs of Soviet aircraft would exceed those of their Western counterparts in absolute terms, even if their capital costs did not. This is more likely to be true the more sophisticated the platform, thus impacting naval and air platforms in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we might consider personnel. More sophisticated platforms tend to draw on skilled personnel, both for manufacture and subsequent manning. To the extent that skilled and educated personnel represent a capability bottleneck which will be exacerbated by emigration, platforms drawing on such individuals will compete with other elements of the force that require skilled personnel. This could include, for example, operators for air defences and C2 systems such as Akatsia-M. Of course, defence could outcompete other sectors for remaining skilled personnel, but only at the cost of creating distortions elsewhere. While Russia has embraced the integration of autonomous and uncrewed systems into all aspects of warfare throughout its operations in Ukraine, it retains a lack of trust towards machines and full autonomy. It continues to fund research into AI but, again, it is not a world leader in this field and therefore lags behind the West in these areas which could potentially solve some of the crewing issues faced by militaries around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia has shown a great deal of sensitivity to the maritime domain as a threat vector, and its leadership has displayed a willingness to expend considerable resources on attempting to secure the nation’s maritime flanks. However, this represents an opportunity cost for the rest of the Russian military in several ways. First, maritime platforms are inherently capital intensive and require inputs in precisely those areas where Russia has considerable weaknesses. Moreover, maintaining capabilities such as air defences sufficient to close off Russia’s maritime approaches requires Russia to strip them from other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with this level of expenditure, significant challenges remain for Russia. One Russian analyst has suggested that the Russian armed forces had a third of the resources needed to secure the country’s maritime approaches, while considerable debates have taken place within Russia regarding the need for power projection platforms. Furthermore, gaps remain in Russia’s air and sea denial capabilities in areas such as the High North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-case-study-naval-dynamics-on-natos-northern-flank&quot;&gt;II. Case Study: Naval Dynamics on NATO’s Northern Flank&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian position in the High North is a useful case study. While Russia has invested considerable effort in reinforcing its military position in the region, it nonetheless faces certain critical gaps in capability that could prove to be enduring. If Russia were to invest in resolving these challenges, it would necessarily have to do so at the expense of other parts of its force structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not identical to its Soviet predecessor, the VMF’s conception of its role, including in this region, is similar. A primary wartime function of the Soviet fleet was the defence of SSBNs in their bastions, because the leadership of the USSR perceived the balance of nuclear power at the end of a conflict to be a critical determinant of bargaining power at the point of conflict termination. The assumptions underpinning this concept remain for Russia today. To this end, the Soviets organised their fleet for the defence of three zones: a coastal defence zone within 200 km of Russia’s shores; a near seas zone within 1,000 km; and a far seas zone up to 2,000 km from Russia. At a minimum, Russian forces should be able to dominate the coastal defence zone and achieve sea denial in the near seas and far seas zones. Russian strategists do not, however, perceive their role in purely reactive terms – one way in which Soviet SSNs were to contribute to shaping war termination dynamics was by actively hunting adversary SSBNs. Today, Russia views the balances which will determine the circumstances of war termination as including adversary conventional long-range precision strike capabilities, given the increased lethality of the latter against command nodes, logistical facilities and nuclear assets themselves. As such, at a minimum it will be a standing requirement for Russian naval forces in the High North and Arctic both to prevent platforms capable of holding long-range strike capabilities from entering into the Arctic, including denial of access to the oceans directly abutting it (from where long-range strike capabilities can be launched with limited warning), and to eliminate adversary platforms on the open oceans where possible. The ability of Russia’s forces to achieve this, however, may be constrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first area in which Russia will face considerable capability gaps in the High North is anti-submarine warfare (ASW). Though Russia’s Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command maintains a sizeable force of both conventional and nuclear attack submarines, its capacity for defensive ASW is somewhat more constrained. Russia’s fleet of 44 Ilyushin Il-38N and Tupolev Tu-142 maritime patrol aircraft, though not small by any standard, is split between the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command and the Pacific Fleet. Moreover, it is considerably more limited than the maritime patrol aircraft force that Russian planners intended to have at their disposal – the VMF had aspired to field 30 Il-38Ns by 2020, in addition to its fleet of Tu-142s. Factors such as readiness must be taken into account, and there are certain trends which will compound the problems posed by the lack of airborne surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the Russian surface fleet’s capacity to support ASW is also becoming increasingly constrained. The Udaloy II-class destroyer – the backbone of the Soviet Navy’s and then the VMF’s surface ASW capabilities – is likely reaching the point of obsolescence. While new surface platforms such as the Admiral Gorshkov-class frigate can provide a newer and more capable replacement, Russia’s production of the Gorshkov class has faced considerable delays, driven by both the limitations of Russia’s indigenous shipbuilding base and its loss of access to gas turbine engines (which it procured from Ukraine) after 2014. Compounding this are considerable overruns in the repair and refit of existing vessels such as the Kirov-class cruiser Admiral Nakhimov. Russia can continue to build vessels such as the Gorshkov-class frigates, but it will face capacity constraints. To cite one example, the Russian effort to develop combined diesel and gas engines to replace Ukrainian imports has delivered eventual success, but Russia is restricted to the production of two such engines a year, and even this rate of production may prove difficult to sustain. A major bottleneck will be capacity at Russian shipyards, which are currently running at capacity. Compounding this is the need for import substitution: the Kolomna D49 diesel engine which forms part of the M55R power unit includes several imported components that will be increasingly difficult for Russia to procure in the face of export controls. Given that the engines on naval vessels are subject to a wear rate when they are at sea, spare part restrictions can also impact the operational tempo of existing vessels. Sanctions evasion is of course possible, but this imposes additional fiscal costs on already expensive programmes. Finally, wider challenges faced by Russian civilian shipbuilding mean that civilian and military projects may, to an extent, compete for the same resources, particularly with respect to personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the airbases upon which Russian assets rely – assets such as the Tu-22M3 bomber and the Il-38N, which are crucial to denying access to surface vessels and submarines respectively – are vulnerable to air attack, as was recently demonstrated in the Ukrainian attacks on the Engels airbase. The size of the fixed-wing aircraft being deployed from these bases makes the use of hardened air shelters or dispersion impractical. While some security can be provided using airbases deeper within Russia, this comes at a cost in terms of presence and endurance (and many of these airbases can be threatened from other vectors). Russia can mitigate these challenges, but only through the employment of a robust regional air defence network. It currently maintains such a network in the form of three S-300 and S-400 regiments under OSK Sever. In addition to this, the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command maintains an electronic warfare centre at Severomorsk, which controls electronic warfare complexes such as the Murmansk-BN and the Krasukha-4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways in which this picture can become considerably more complex for Russia. First, the changing climate in the High North might considerably expand the areas which the VMF must survey and thus deny to adversary assets. In particular, changes that make seasonal circumpolar navigation easier for subsurface assets will complicate the task of ASW in the High North and Arctic. Similar changes will also make ingress by submarines into the Arctic from the east possible to a degree that was not previously viable, both by Russian adversaries (NATO) and, potentially in the future, by China, which will complicate the water space further for Russia. Moreover, detecting submarines in the region will be complicated by factors such as the increase in temperature of the Arctic Ocean and changes in salinity that will affect sound channels, greater ambient oceanic noise due to increases in oceanic wildlife, open-ocean storms (where there used to be ice), and increases in the movement of sea ice as the ice cap breaks up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second risk to Russia’s conceived approach to oceanic defence is posed by the increasing range of strike assets. For example, the common hypersonic glide body intended for use by the US Army and Navy has a 4,000 km range, which would allow it to have an effect over much of western Russia from the Norwegian Sea. Moreover, strike platforms such as hypersonics and land attack cruise missiles, which exist at the high end of the cost continuum, are joined by considerably cheaper long-range strike assets. As an example, consider one-way attack UAVs, such as the Iranian-made Shahed-136, which have a theoretical range of 2,000 km. While limited in terms of sensors and payload, such munitions can be of use against soft targets such as administrative buildings, or targets which are inherently incendiary such as fuel or munitions stocks. At least one recent Russian study has noted that the munitions expenditure involved in engaging UAVs as well as the detection challenges they pose represent serious air defence challenges. The challenge of range for the VMF is that it forces the VMF to sortie out to engage platforms which can pose a threat from well beyond Russia’s bastions, and thus places a higher premium on Tier 1 platforms that can operate on open oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third risk facing Russia is that of the changing strategic geography of the northern flank spurred by NATO’s enlargement. First, this will spur a convergence between regions such as the Baltic and the High North. This challenge is inextricable from that of range. A sufficiently long-ranged strike munition such as the TLAM could impact many of the same regions from either the Norwegian Sea or the Baltic Sea, but the proximity to Russia of the latter region relative to the former means that strikes from within the Baltic Sea could occur with limited warning times, while missiles fired from further afield could arrive as a follow-on capability. This creates multiple avenues for convergent strikes from multiple vectors. Though Russia can more easily deny parts of the Baltic Sea with ground-based missiles in Kaliningrad, this is less true of the littorals of nations such as Sweden. Much of Russia’s capacity for denial depends on closing the straits of Denmark, which will prove difficult if NATO vessels are posturing in a crisis short of war, especially when a number of NATO members are on the other side of the straits. Secondly, the proximity of NATO’s northern flank to Russian strategic bastions means that strike capabilities which might have been classed as tactical can have a strategic effect. An ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) missile in Finland, for example, has strategic ramifications, as does an aircraft which might have been viewed as a tactical capability. If contending purely with ground-based assets, this might actually incentivise Russia to pre-empt before platforms can be dispersed. A maritime dimension to deterrence can remove this incentive by introducing strike assets which cannot be as easily pre-empted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the risk that the Alliance can enforce a distant blockade on the Russian Federation, which must still move energy from areas such as the Arctic through chokepoints in both the east (in the form of the Bering Strait) and the west (through the GIUK Gap). Overland alternatives do exist, but their capacity is likely to be considerably constrained. Moreover, most overland methods of circumventing a blockade, such as pipelines or routes to alternative terminals, are resource-intensive endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Russia can mitigate each of these challenges. It is not yet clear that NATO has the capacity to present the Russian leadership with the challenges that its maritime doctrine is partially based around mitigating. However, it is the authors’ contention that the Alliance has avenues through which to adapt its maritime posture in a 10-year timeframe in order to present Russia with an asymmetrical offset to the advantages that it may enjoy on land in terms of both mass and proximity to likely theatres. Moreover, the development of these avenues can force Russia into disproportionately costly mitigations, which will impose opportunity costs elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-emerging-opportunities-for-allied-planning&quot;&gt;III. Emerging Opportunities for Allied Planning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge that Russia faces in the maritime domain can be summarised as follows. In order to be strategically secure enough to pursue a full spectrum of competitive actions including escalation to local and regional conflict, Russia must deny the maritime domain out to 1,000 km. All of the platforms and enablers that might allow Russia to achieve this are, by their nature, inherently complex. The surveillance and reconnaissance needed to cue conventional missiles at reach have thus far not been developed by Russia, while aerial and maritime platforms operating at long distances do so at considerable risk. As such, to the extent that the Alliance can expand the area over which Russia must achieve sea denial in order to protect itself against long-range strikes, it can shape the contours of Russian force regeneration. It can achieve this primarily in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By expanding its long-range land attack capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By operating on new vectors that Russia has not historically had to defend.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the assets of Alliance members can be postured in ways that incentivise Russian responses at reach. For example, exercises at or just beyond the Russian near seas zone focused specifically on strike, comparable to exercises such as Formidable Shield (which focuses on Integrated Air and Missile Defence), would in all likelihood compel responses. We might, for example, consider the relationship between NATO’s Trident Juncture and the scale of Russia’s Ocean Shield exercises, which consistently track one another. This is an asymmetrical challenge for Russia, which is operating fewer and older hulls, but it would also compel Russian leaders to plan in terms of their existing fears regarding strikes from the northern vector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Russia views this challenge in multi-theatre terms, sequencing exercises by NATO and those conducted by member states such as the US in the Indo-Pacific could act as a forcing function to compel even larger-scale responses by Russia. This was the case during the Cold War, when the Soviet Navy felt compelled to stage multi-theatre exercises, such as Okean, to demonstrate its ability to operate across theatres. The cost of such activity in both human terms and platform wear can have an indirect effect on Russia’s ability to project power elsewhere, especially in a context where recent state armament plans have prioritised surface vessels with limited endurance, and given the age and reliability issues facing many larger platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other ways for the Alliance to increase the strain on Russian forces that are constrained by both vessel age and human capital. For example, forward activity by Allied SSNs, particularly on transpolar routes, would create an imperative to maintain more persistent surveillance over a considerably wider area. Russian efforts to maintain situational awareness in these areas would be non-discretionary, both because of the importance of these zones for patrolling SSBNs and because Russia’s air defences over the central Arctic are relatively sparse, underscoring the risk of key air defence radar being suppressed by submarine-launched cruise missiles to open the way for other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, sea control at key chokepoints could be underscored through exercises which emphasise interdiction for other reasons. For example, exercises framed in terms of the need to interdict threats to critical infrastructure or to counter illicit activity would, if conducted at or near strategic chokepoints, have an implicit effect in terms of messaging. Unlike larger-scale exercises, which often take years to plan, such activity could be conducted on a more routine basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-practical-impediments-to-a-competitive-strategies-approach-and-ways-to-overcome-them&quot;&gt;IV. Practical Impediments to a “Competitive Strategies” Approach and Ways to Overcome Them&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several challenges inherent in an approach that is designed to compete in the way described above. Among them are potential risks to strategic stability and the positions of different NATO Alliance members with regard to a forward-leaning maritime posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first risk, that strategic stability could be upended if Russia perceives a risk to its own critical capabilities, is one that political leaders across the Alliance would understandably wish to avoid. There are several ways in which this risk might manifest itself. First, a Russia that perceived risks to its C2 (including its nuclear C2), second strike or other critical capabilities might well have incentives to escalate early in a crisis. Secondly, the nature of certain elements of a competitive strategy, such as the forward posturing of subsurface assets, could lead to challenges such as the loss of communications and thus control; this issue arose during the Cold War when American SSNs such as the Gato conducted operations near the Soviet coastline, an activity that carried inherent escalatory risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first challenge, while real, can also be stabilising in certain respects. If, as a precondition for military action, Russia had to posture forces in a way that insured it against a crippling first strike, this would, in principle, limit its avenues for limited military action. Any escalation would need to be accompanied by a set of actions which in turn would make it difficult for the Russian leadership to communicate limited intent, and would thus only be justifiable in extremis. Moreover, it should be noted that the very proximity of NATO’s borders to Russia and the possibility of long-range strike being surged in a crisis creates a pre-emptive logic for Russia irrespective of maritime strategy. Indeed, the relative viability of suppressing targets such as aircraft on the ground, given the concentration of Allied aircraft in generally unhardened airbases, would incentivise this. The relative difficulty of pre-emptively suppressing maritime platforms with conventional capabilities except when in port would remove some incentives for conventional pre-emption which might exist against ground-based platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is worth noting that the authors are not suggesting that in an escalating crisis, Western states should opt to engage in strikes against the Russian homeland on the scale that Russia fears. Rather, the proposition is that uncertainty regarding whether this might occur, if engendered in peacetime, can have a positive competitive effect. Perhaps most importantly, however, it is already the case that Russia appears intent on developing a range of capabilities, such as the Poseidon nuclear torpedo and the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, which are built to insure it against a crippling first strike. If this is indeed the case, then it is not obvious that instability is avoidable. Rather, what appears more likely to be shaped by Western policy is the degree to which Russia invests in such capabilities, rather than taking other avenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge – namely, Alliance cohesion – is considerable, especially in areas such as the High North, where some members of the Alliance are likely to be heavily invested in regional stability for entirely understandable reasons. It should be noted that this would not necessarily be the first instance in which debates over Allied posture have proved divisive; NATO’s shift to a flexible response posture and the later adoption of the Follow-on Forces Attack doctrine were also accompanied by controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several avenues which might be pursued as mitigations. First, in the vein of NATO’s Harmel formula, deterrence can be combined with engagement, whereby reciprocal de-escalatory actions by Russia can be matched in kind. For example, the tempo of Allied SSN activity in the High North might be linked to Russian activity near Allied undersea cables. Linking activity with engagement can allay some Allied fears. Secondly, some of the capabilities described would impact the High North even if not postured in the region on a long-term basis. Maritime platforms hosting strike assets such as hypersonics, for example, can pose a theoretical threat from well beyond areas such as the Norwegian Sea. As such, they need not be persistently forward postured, and their intermittent presence need be viewed no differently from the occasional deployments of strategic bombers to the region. Since the mobility of air and maritime assets allows for relatively rapid posturing, the Russian leadership is likely to view the balance of precision strike capabilities as being determined by the number of missiles each side possesses, rather than those regionally postured. Thus, forward deployment in ways that pose a challenge to Alliance cohesion may in many instances be unnecessary. This would not be equally true of other activities, such as subsurface activity along the Northern Sea Route; however, such activity is likely to involve a limited subset of Allied navies in any instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subset of challenges relates to military capacity. In many of the areas described, including long-range strike capabilities and subsurface assets, members of the Alliance will face their own considerable shortfalls in capacity. To use an example, the UK currently has a single launch vector for deep strikes inland from the maritime domain – namely the TLAM launched from the Astute-class submarine. This challenge will likely be compounded by the eventuality that a large proportion of the capabilities fielded by the US will be reallocated to the Indo-Pacific theatre to contend with an increasingly capable People’s Liberation Army Navy. The Alliance will also face shortfalls in other areas, such as submarines capable of operating under ice, and limitations to the human capital available across Allied navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, however, that considering the present operating circumstances which Russia faces, it is likely that capabilities needed to compete effectively with the Russian Federation in the medium term will be needed in a 10-year timeframe and beyond. As such, Allied maritime capabilities can be viewed in the same vein as virtually any other category of capability, such as munitions – while present shortfalls in production capacity are real, there is a window in which they might be rectified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A relatively quick way in which members of the Alliance could increase Russian uncertainty regarding the scale of the precision-strike threat is by experimenting with the use of air defence interceptors in a dual-capable role. This has already been the case with the SM-2 and SM-6 missiles, and while there are many technical reasons why interceptors may not be the best means of striking targets at reach, the fact that Russian planners already presume that they will play this role means that they will have to be factored into planning regarding the strike threat to soft-skinned targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The containerisation of subsonic munitions both by Russia and more recently by the US Marine Corps suggests that at least some strike assets could be emplaced on non-dedicated platforms in a crisis, or deployed ashore in an escalating crisis. This would also be the case for attritable one-way attack UAVs, which can be containerised in larger numbers. Though unlikely to pose a threat to hardened targets, such capabilities are regarded by Russia as posing a credible threat to targets such as airfields, on which strategic capabilities such as ASW aircraft and bombers are based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch platforms for bespoke capabilities such as hypersonics are likely to pose more of a challenge, given the lengths of the strike cells needed. Presently, only the US Navy’s payload-module-equipped Virginia-class submarines could plausibly carry long-range hypersonic missiles, and any competitive approach in Europe will depend on the presence of at least some of these assets within European waters. This being said, there are relatively few targets that are either so heavily hardened or so fleeting that they demand the use of a hypersonic missile. In a 10-year timeframe, this could change, as European navies such as the Royal Navy seek to integrate hypersonics on future platforms such as the SSN(R). The fact that ground-based versions of naval hypersonics which fit within 40-foot container-sized launchers are also being developed holds out the option of deploying missiles ashore from amphibious shipping, rather than firing them from vessels. If concerns regarding emissions and heat can be mitigated, container-based hypersonics can also be integrated on non-bespoke platforms. As an example, we might consider how the Israeli Lora SRBM has been containerised and operated from a non-dedicated vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Russian defence planning is programmed on a 10-year basis, the choices that the Russian state makes for investments out to a 10-year time horizon are dependent on the force structures that it may expect to face. With respect to the missiles themselves, the primary barrier will be R&amp;amp;D costs, and there is some reason to believe that a model comparable to the F-35 – with manufacturing distributed, but intellectual property held by states that have moved ahead of the pack – should be the basis for work on hypersonics envisioned via the AUKUS (Australia, UK and US) defence partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward SSN operations could prove much more challenging, given that most SSN fleets are unlikely to grow in the next decade, and the demand on the US Navy in the Indo-Pacific is likely to increase. Past the next decade, this challenge may be alleviated somewhat, but this is uncertain. Uncrewed solutions may offer an offset to limited hulls, and uncrewed capabilities have the potential to be used in similar roles, but with a different concept of employment to the standard SSNs of today. First, autonomous vessels can be used for forward surveillance, and have already been used in this capacity by states such as China. While this poses a risk of platforms being captured, it also allows for intelligence gathering without the escalatory risks that the use of crewed assets near hostile shores posed during the Cold War. Moreover, the task of tracking subsurface contacts, whether crewed or not, would be one that imposes burdens on Russian ASW assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, uncrewed capabilities can be used for tasks such as forward minelaying, and as active sonar emitters in forward positions, which can enable passive detection by more valuable crewed platforms. This is important since one of the reasons that SSNs need other platforms to perform wide area searches is that they cannot afford to emit themselves. Rather than operating in an anti-SSBN role, NATO’s SSNs could act as a forward perimeter. This could impose dilemmas on Russia when viewed in conjunction with the imperative that long-range strike creates for Russian SSNs to sortie beyond their bastions: if strike creates imperatives for SSNs and SSGNs to be utilised in risk-acceptant ways, mines and uncrewed capabilities teamed with smaller numbers of crewed platforms will be able to ambush them in forward positions. The resultant dilemma is one that Russian planners will not easily contend with in a crisis. On the other hand, the complexities of communicating underwater make the direct control of uncrewed underwater vehicles as armed complements to crewed submarines difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, however, the question in each instance will be whether the capabilities developed can impose more costs than those required to develop them in the first place. In this, the Alliance will have the advantage of knowing that Russia will have to develop mitigations premised on a worst-case scenario. As illustrated by Russian literature that consistently overemphasises the scale at which the Alliance can generate long-range strikes, and by both Russian and Soviet responses to prior changes in Alliance posture, it is conceivable that even marginal investments in the areas described will impose disproportionately costly adaptations on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s reactive application of maritime power does not currently translate into strategic effects, but with three subtle changes it could. Firstly, it could do so through the creation of an environment that forces Russia to expend resources on capabilities needed to deny the open ocean to NATO navies; secondly, the employment of maritime forces can serve as a war termination tool by increasing the costs of a protracted conflict in tandem with ground forces, which deny short-term gains; and finally, because many of the platforms which Russia uses for sub-strategic nuclear use are either maritime or, like strategic bombers, can be impacted from the sea with conventional capabilities, a maritime threat to the bulk of Russia’s sub-strategic launch capability can considerably alter perceptions of a favourable strategic balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime power has historically been an asymmetrical advantage for the Alliance vis-à-vis Russia, and it can continue to play this role. Russia’s concepts for defending its maritime periphery commit it to a posture which can only be sustained by platforms that are capital intensive – precisely the type of capability that Russia is least well-situated to generate. By investing in capabilities in areas such as long-range strike, the Alliance can exacerbate the challenges which Russia faces. This, in turn, means that the way Allied maritime power is conceived should be a function of what can be delivered ashore from the sea (which is what Russian leaders primarily worry about), rather than seizing sea control per se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has several concerns about the use of maritime that could be exploited by NATO. Firstly, there is the threat to Russia’s second-strike capability. Russia views the use of the maritime domain as a launch vector for adversary long-range precision fires into the heart of the Russian homeland, including critical national infrastructure, airbases and strategic strike capabilities. It has therefore sought to improve surface-to-air missile coverage and situational awareness through increased radar sites across the High North in an effort to detect and deter potential aggression from this vector. Secondly, Russia’s traditional concerns regarding the safety of its second strike may be exacerbated by the impact of climate change. Thirdly, Russia fears the risk of a distant blockade of the Russian Federation’s maritime lines of communication, not only in the Baring Strait/GIUK Gap but also in the Baltic, the Black Sea and into the Pacific. Overland import/export routes are costly and rely on good relationships with neighbouring nations, something that cannot be guaranteed, and therefore lacks potential investors. This is further exacerbated by the use of grey shipping, which has ways of being legally interdicted in peacetime. Without steady access to engines and spares, Russia’s ability to maintain its fleets and maritime squadrons will be significantly called into question, leaving the maritime areas open to further exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These concerns can be exploited by NATO to create strategic advantages. The Alliance can use a threat to shift the strategic balance in its favour in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By shaping Russian leaders’ pre-conflict assessments of their ability (or lack thereof) to control a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By shifting the allocation of scarce resources towards costly mitigations such as air defences and platforms capable of contesting distant seas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By setting the conditions for war termination if deterrence fails and initial denial is achieved on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fear of Allied maritime power has historically provoked counter-reactions by Russia. As a lack of response would imply a weakening in Russia’s stance internally, a response to any NATO action is typically thought necessary. These counter-reactions are financially costly and increase the strain on Russian forces, which are constrained by both vessel age and human capital. The cost of such activity in both human terms and platform wear can have an indirect effect on Russia’s ability to project power elsewhere. The forward posturing of Allied subsurface assets and circumpolar transits represent two avenues through which this kind of outcome might be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO should, however, recognise its own shortfalls, including the subset of challenges related to military capacity. In many of the areas described, including long-range strike capabilities and subsurface assets, members of the Alliance will face their own considerable shortfalls in capacity. There are certain ways in which the Alliance can rationalise its approach to producing precision strike capabilities. The first might be an emphasis on commonality of capabilities – something already visible in initiatives to increase the Alliance’s capacity in areas such as air defence. Allied efforts to co-produce existing effectors rather than develop multiple independent types could yield considerable efficiencies; the emphasis of AUKUS Pillar 2 on fielding hypersonics could serve as the first step for a wider Allied effort in this regard. The Alliance will also face shortfalls in other areas that will necessitate the preparation of their navies to operate on a warfighting basis against a well-defined threat. Capabilities needed to compete effectively with the Russian Federation in the medium term will need to be fielded in a 10-year timeframe and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second likely concern – a lack of platforms to hold strike assets – could be mitigated in several ways, including through the containerisation of subsonic munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, different approaches to ASW could expand the threat envelope for opponents. Though hardly a panacea, uncrewed solutions such as uncrewed underwater vehicles can be used for tasks such as emplacing mines in forward positions within bastions, as well as for forward surveillance. A combination of the machine learning tools that make low-frequency active sonar (previously too riddled with false positives to be used as a tactical asset) a viable means of detection at reach could allow a combination of distant platforms used for detection to cue in more attritable ones in their final approach, without the requirement to risk SSNs forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each instance, the key consideration will be whether capabilities developed can impose more costs than those required to develop them in the first place, which should be the key determinant of Allied policy in the maritime domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（31日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第20日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。辯方在庭上展示訊息紀錄，指《蘋果》因應國安法而採取不同舉動，包括將戴耀廷「真攬炒十步」文章下架、刪除廣告上的「光時」標語及棄用「武漢肺炎」字眼等，張確認是為了避免觸犯國安法。辯方又指張於2021年向高院申請保釋時，提交了一份誓章，聲稱《蘋果》實行編採自主，而他自己從沒參與審批文章和制訂編採政策。辯方質疑張過去兩周的庭上證供，與誓章的說法不一致，是為了指證黎智英及減輕刑罰。張否認，並堅稱他只是負責「轉達」黎的指示，並沒有「制訂」編採政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方播25週年慶典錄影片-黎笑稱蘋果日報今日做到咁是一眾員工造成&quot;&gt;辯方播25週年慶典錄影片 黎笑稱「蘋果日報今日做到咁」是一眾員工造成&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方在庭上播放一段影片，拍攝於2020年6月18日，壹傳媒大樓舉辦《蘋果日報》25週年慶祝活動，畫面可見黎智英站在中間，前面枱面上有燒豬及寫著「25」的大蘋果公仔，而張劍虹和前動新聞平台總監張志偉站在黎的兩旁。黎向一眾員工發言稱：「都未曾試過風調雨順架，一係就話我哋血腥八卦，一係就呢個封殺廣告，一係就俾人攻擊，到依家呢，就國安法都嚟埋，都唔知點樣做喇真係。就靠你哋去做喇。」黎表示只要求一件事：「你哋對住國安法嘅做法就係，你哋用返你哋對自己嘅責任，對社會嘅責任，對你哋家庭嘅責任去做呢份工作，無人會迫你哋點樣去做，無人會迫到你哋做烈士」。黎籲員工：「攞住對自己嘅良知，攞住對社會嘅良知去做，我唔會叫你哋點樣去做」，又形容「蘋果日報到今日，做到咁樣樣，係你哋造成嘅，唔關我事架吓」，影片傳來笑聲和鼓掌聲。黎笑言：「國安法嚟唔關我事」，最後表示欣賞一眾員工付出，寄語大家繼續努力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎發言中途有一把聲音說「繼續堅持」，問是否張的聲音。張起初稱不記得，之後再度翻看影片後確認。辯方續指，黎所說「無人會迫你哋點樣去做」是事實，惟張不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎稱「蘋果日報到今日，做到咁樣樣，係你哋做成嘅」，是指一眾記者和編輯的核心價值及運作方式。惟張說：「我唔知黎生呢句係咩意思，睇唔到有咩value。」辯方指出，張並沒有反對黎的說話，張則指：「黎生的確有講過呢句說話，但係黎生好似講緊笑咋嘛。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰則認為黎似乎不是在說笑，問張是否同意黎的意思是員工上下鼎力合作。張表示：「同意員工上下合作，但都係喺黎生嘅領導、指示之下。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息紀錄顯示國安法生效後-黎提醒張不用魯莽&quot;&gt;訊息紀錄顯示國安法生效後 黎提醒張不用魯莽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年7月1日的訊息對話，國安法生效當天早上，黎傳送訊息表示對國安法細節表示震驚，又指「先要想好策略對付，不用魯莽」，但之後表示會到籌款街站幫手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方盤問下，張確認他不想違反法例，但國安法在七一生效之後，當天有遊行，「唔知會發生咩事」。辯方續問張是否同意，黎訊息的意思是提醒不要觸犯法律。張同意：「係囉，叫我小心啲囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示張劍虹問楊清奇社評內容-確保沒有違法&quot;&gt;訊息顯示張劍虹問楊清奇社評內容 確保沒有違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指因應國安法，《蘋果》高層設立了不同聊天群組，包括「國安法應變委員會」、「報紙敏感廣告小組」和「應變小組」，原因正如張劍虹所稱：「唔知紅線喺邊」，所以有需要確保眾人知道什麼事可以做、什麼事不可以做，以避免觸犯國安法。張確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示2021年4月21日的WhatsApp訊息，張劍虹向楊清奇傳來一張文章截圖，問：「主筆，你印象中我們社評有寫過這些？」楊回覆：「國安法出台前可能有」，張回覆：「出台前就不算違法」、「現在倡假新聞法看來勢在必行」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問張是否想避免觸犯法律。張僅指當時是4月份，有不同消息指《蘋果》在七一之前就會「冚」，即公司關閉和拘捕同事，形容情況「迫在眉睫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示張劍虹關注廣告含光時是否合法&quot;&gt;訊息顯示張劍虹關注廣告含「光時」是否合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方再展示張劍虹和前《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏之間的訊息對話，在2020年7月4日即國安法生效不久，張傳來一張廣告截圖，問：「有光時句子廣告，你點睇？」辯方指，因張對該廣告有保留，想問陳該廣告是否合法，反映他想避免觸犯國安法。張確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，雖然陳沛敏回覆：「Joanne（廣告部主管）指Rosa（《蘋果》法律顧問）話OK」，但張想特別謹慎，所以直接向Rosa咨詢法律意見。張說：「應該係咁」，但訊息沒有提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問到，最後該廣告有否照原稿登出。張說：「改咗架，最後唔係原來咁嘅樣」，又指「光復香港，時代革命」八個字被刪除，以另外八個字取代。他確認此舉是因為不想觸犯國安法紅線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又確認，他、陳沛敏和《蘋果》高層曾經就國安法舉辦數次座談會，部份邀請資深大律師。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示張劍虹徵詢法律意見後-著同事將戴耀廷真攬炒十步文章下架&quot;&gt;訊息顯示張劍虹徵詢法律意見後 著同事將戴耀廷「真攬炒十步」文章下架&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辦方續展示2021年3月9日的訊息，張志偉表示發覺最近很多人搜尋戴耀廷的文章《真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命》，問是否應該將文章從《蘋果日報》網站下架；張劍虹表示問過法律顧問Rosa 的意見，要求下架文章。張確認相關對話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另提及「應變小組」群組，指黎智英並不是群組成員之一。張確認，因黎於2020年12月起便還柙，而群組於2021年4月才開設。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，剛才庭上提及有數個群組，問黎是否都不在這些群組裡。張確認，但不是因為黎還柙而沒有加入，因有些群組較早成立，但也沒有加入黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指出，黎沒有加入這些群組，是因為黎將編採政策交由編輯們處理。張不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;群組顯示討論棄用武漢肺炎標籤-張突提及黎獄中傳話蘋果不應自行了斷&quot;&gt;群組顯示討論棄用「武漢肺炎」標籤 張突提及黎獄中傳話《蘋果》不應自行了斷&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又展示2021年4月18日群組訊息紀錄，前《蘋果》總編輯羅偉光指當天起不再使用「武漢肺炎」標籤（tag），可改用「最新疫情」、「變種病毒」或「社區爆發」等。張劍虹之後在群組表示，「能採訪就採訪，能揭發就揭發，本著良心如實報導，只是避開一些字眼，過去這些字眼沒問題，今時唔同往日，大家都明白，保留一把聲音重要，硬撞無謂」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問張所稱「今時唔同往日」是否指國安法生效。張則指不只這個意思，因當時國安法生效了大半年，踏入2021年4月，《蘋果日報》情況愈來愈嚴峻，因政府官員聲稱會訂立假新聞法，又點名《蘋果》是一個會追究的對象，所以公司有很多傳聞指「《蘋果》過唔到七一呀，有好多講法話《蘋果》要唔要自己收檔呀」，所以才會引發之後舉辦全體員工大會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張突提到，在2021年4月底到獄中探訪黎時，他曾向黎提及員工的擔憂，又引述副刊專欄作家陶傑撰文表示：「《蘋果》係唔係應該自行了斷呢？啫係《蘋果日報》做咗咁多年，冇人會怪你嘅」，張就上述外界說法請示黎。張引述黎當時回應：「點解要自己冚咗佢？不如做到俾人冚為止啦。」於是張繼續「小心翼翼」地做下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引張劍虹申保釋時呈交之誓章-當中聲稱從不涉及審批文章和制訂編採政策&quot;&gt;辯方引張劍虹申保釋時呈交之誓章 當中聲稱從不涉及審批文章和制訂編採政策&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方盤問下，張確認他於2021年6月17日涉違反國安法罪名拘捕，於6月18日被控「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」，接著於6月19日被帶上法庭提堂。張當時透過律師代表申請保釋，但遭到拒絕。他其後向高院申請保釋，為了支持其申請，他向法庭提交了一份以宗教形式宣誓的誓章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述誓章內容，開首提及張的個人背景、教育、工作經驗和是次起訴對他而言是什麼。在其後段落，張聲稱《蘋果日報》實行編採自主，文章、影片和其他材料不需經過高層審批才能「出街」。張確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續引述，張在誓章中強調他本人並沒有被要求或負責審批《蘋果》的文章、影片，也強調自己從不涉及制訂編採政策和做法，又聲稱控方完全扭曲他在壹傳媒集團中的角色。張確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指張劍虹誓章與庭上證供不一致-張否認-強調僅轉達黎指示&quot;&gt;辯方指張劍虹誓章與庭上證供不一致 張否認 強調僅轉達黎指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則嚴正指出，張劍虹在誓章中的說法，與他過去兩星期在庭上所作之證供，呈現出兩種截然不同的畫面。張表示「唔同意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，張一直告訴法庭，他將黎智英的編採指示轉達給《蘋果》同事，惟他誓章中卻聲稱自己「從未涉及制訂編採政策和做法」。張則回應，他只是負責「轉達」黎的指示，並沒有「制訂」編採政策，「事實上我冇制訂編採政策，啫我哋係跟黎生嘅編採政策執行，呢個係我喺法庭講嘅事實。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，張的誓章指壹傳媒嚴格執行「編採自主」，與張庭上所說的不符。張則回應，高層包括他和周達權均不會干預編採自主，「呢個係講緊傳媒裡面嘅防火牆」，即是不會因為商業原因、廣告或其他財務上的原因而影響編採政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹否認牽涉制訂編採政策-但承認有份執行&quot;&gt;張劍虹否認牽涉「制訂」編採政策 但承認有份「執行」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於張稱「高層不包括黎智英」的說法，張解釋一直以來都認為黎是「老闆」，「喺我腦海佢係一個boss，唔係好似我咁一個高級打工仔，因為佢係成個生意嘅股東，擁有70%股份，成個生意都係佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方質疑，張庭上供稱負責確保黎的編採政策有被落實，又如何聲稱自己沒有以任何形式牽涉制訂編採政策和實行做法？張不同意，因辯方所說的「setting」是指制訂政策。不過在法官李運騰的澄清下，張同意他有牽涉「實行」（implementing）編採政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰又問，張誓章聲稱從沒審批文章和影片，那又如何確保《蘋果日報》的編採政策有嚴格執行呢？張表示他不會在報導和題材「出街」之前審批，而是在「出街」之後才檢視；此外其他高層都很有經驗，也在公司做了20年，包括陳沛敏、林文宗、羅偉光和楊清奇，張表示對他們能執行編採政策「好有信心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰其後追問張「實行」的意思。張說「就係要將黎生的編採政策傳遞去幾個senior management 同事」，而且張會留意他們有否執行黎的政策，以及檢視網站文章和實體報紙，當黎看到有何不足需要改善，便會向張及其他同事講。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑張劍虹為了指證黎智英-更改庭上說法&quot;&gt;辯方質疑張劍虹為了指證黎智英 更改庭上說法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方質疑，張承認執行編採政策，正正意味著他牽涉利用《蘋果日報》作為平台，請求外國實施制裁和敵對措施，然而他卻在誓章中否認此行為。張則表示：「啫嗰時唔清楚法例，同告緊嗰樣嘢囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，張理應知道控方控告的是「串謀」罪，而不是指控張直接參與，所以就算僅僅執行涉案政策，也是牽涉犯罪。張則表示：「因為我唔係法律專家啦，（當時）律師又未同我解釋得咁詳細。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指出，張在庭上更改說法，目的是要指證黎智英。法官李運騰打斷，指張並沒有更改證供。辯方繼而修正，指出以張在《蘋果日報》中的角色而言，張的庭上證供與他誓章中的說法之間，兩者並不一致。張否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又質疑張早已承認了控罪，為求使自己獲得減刑，而在庭上供出與誓章不一致的說法。張表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方盤問未完，案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

There is an urgent need for intervention given Africa’s population of 1.4 billion is forecasted to reach 2.5 billion by 2050, which, when coupled with rising incomes and urbanization, will lead to a significant increase in energy demand. This brief provides six evidence-based insights on Africa’s energy landscape before providing five recommendations on reaching universal energy access amid global decarbonization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;africas-energy-landscape&quot;&gt;AFRICA’S ENERGY LANDSCAPE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy is a significant impediment to economic development in Africa. In 2022, 546 million people in Africa lived in poverty — roughly half of the continent’s population — indicating an urgent need to drive economic growth by creating employment, an endeavor that is impossible without energy access. The continent consumes a disproportionately low amount of energy, accounting for less than 6 percent of global energy consumption despite hosting 18 percent of the world’s population. When excluding South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa’s per capita energy consumption is just 180 kilowatt hours (kWh), compared to 6,500 in Europe and 13,000 kWh in the United States. There is an urgent need to increase the supply of clean energy given Africa’s rapidly growing population. The following are six evidence-based insights on Africa’s energy landscape; these insights provide the foundation for the recommendations on how to reach universal energy access in a way that is most congruent with the world’s emission reductions goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;insight-1-demand-is-significantly-outstripping-supply-and-the-energy-crisis-is-deepening&quot;&gt;Insight 1: Demand is significantly outstripping supply, and the energy crisis is deepening.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the progress made in the past five years toward increasing access to electricity has been reversed due to population growth outpacing electrification rates, supply chain disruptions, and the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic for both households and governments. In 2021, there were 4 percent more people in sub-Saharan Africa without access to electricity compared to 2019. Meanwhile, almost three-quarters of Africa’s population does not have access to clean cooking facilities. Recent spikes in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) prices have made this option unaffordable for nearly 30 million people in Africa, forcing many to switch back to polluting cooking fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the fastest-growing African countries have the highest levels of energy poverty. Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are among the five fastest-growing countries in the world. Nigeria has been experiencing an energy crisis for decades, leaving 90 million people without access to electricity. The country has the highest level of absolute energy poverty in the world and accounts for 12 percent of the global energy access deficit. This deficit has continued to grow over time, increasing by 7 million people over the past decade. Energy inequality also remains pervasive; 84 percent of urban areas have access to power, compared to 26 percent of rural ones. Likewise, the DRC has one of the lowest energy access rates in the world — just 20 percent of its population is projected to have access to modern energy by 2030. It is home to the third-largest population in the world without electricity access. A significant consumer disparity exists within the country, where just 1 percent of the rural population has access to modern energy, compared to 41 percent of the urban population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without significant intervention, Africa’s energy supply will not keep pace with the rising demand stemming from increasing urbanization, economic growth, and a rapidly growing population. Africa’s 1.4 billion population is forecasted to reach 2.5 billion by 2050, at which point the continent will be home to five of the eight most populous countries, with Nigeria surpassing the United States to become the third-largest country in the world. These countries will struggle to economically develop and reduce poverty without energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;insight-2-africa-is-an-energy-paradox--rich-in-energy-resources-but-the-most-energy-poor-continent-due-to-its-dependence-on-resource-exports&quot;&gt;Insight 2: Africa is an energy paradox — rich in energy resources but the most energy-poor continent due to its dependence on resource exports.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa has significant reserves of minerals, oil, and gas. On the minerals front, Africa is home to over 80 percent of the world’s manganese, platinum, and chromium; roughly half of the world’s cobalt; and a fifth of the world’s graphite. These resources are critical for deploying renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles. However, these minerals are not being used for domestic consumption; instead, nearly all extracted minerals are exported for processing, manufacturing, and consumption elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the fossil fuels front, Nigeria, Angola, Libya, and Algeria feature among the top 20 producers of oil globally, leaving them vulnerable to falling oil demand. Overall, 10 out of 54 states on the continent are considered “fossil fuel dependent,” defined as having more than 60 percent of the value of merchandise exports come from the fossil fuel industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploration in sub-Saharan Africa has been productive. Estimates of oil and gas reserves have increased by over a factor of 10 since 1980. Africa was home to nearly 40 percent of global gas discoveries between 2010 and 2020. This includes discoveries in Mozambique, Tanzania, Egypt, Senegal, and South Africa. It now holds roughly 13 percent of the world’s natural gas reserves. Africa’s natural gas industry has significant untapped potential, with over 5,000 billion cubic meters of natural gas discovered but not yet approved for development. Still, fossil fuel efforts on the continent have accelerated in the past few years. In 2023, South Africa’s Ministry of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment gave French company TotalEnergies approval to drill offshore for oil and gas. TotalEnergies spent $300 million — or half of its global exploration budget — in Namibia in 2023, while the UK-based Shell has drilled four exploration wells along Namibia’s coast since 2021 — leading some to suggest that Namibia could become the world’s newest petrostate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ths majority of oil and gas investment in the region comes from international companies and is exported, thereby limiting domestic consumption. Africa exports 80 percent of its crude oil and 45 percent of its natural gas. For example, Mozambique has 100 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves — the third-largest natural gas reserves in Africa. In 2022, Mozambique sent its first shipment of liquefied natural gas to Europe, despite gas contributing just 1 percent of the country’s electricity supply. This is particularly troubling given just 40 percent of the country’s population has access to electricity. The focus on exports is largely because resource-rich African countries are seeking export revenue and firms want reliable offtake countries that are consistently willing to pay for oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;insight-3-weak-unreliable-and-aging-infrastructure-is-a-binding-constraint-to-improving-energy-access&quot;&gt;Insight 3: Weak, unreliable, and aging infrastructure is a binding constraint to improving energy access.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States have struggled to build the infrastructure required to strengthen energy security. For example, Nigeria’s energy sector has drastically deteriorated on the back of weak infrastructure. Between January 2010 and June 2022, there were 222 partial or complete grid collapses. These collapses are a product of grid instability owing to demand exceeding supply, volatile loads from industrial users such as steel mills, old infrastructure, and the unavailability of most transition lines. In the face of these challenges, Nigeria needs significant investment to maintain reliable power supply. The U.S. International Trade Administration estimates that it will cost up to $100 billion over the next two decades simply to maintain current service in Nigeria. The investment required to reach universal energy access would be exponentially more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa experiences similar challenges. The country is profoundly shaped by “load shedding,” or rolling power outages that occur to prevent overloading the national power grid when demand exceeds production. Load shedding has been increasing since 2007, with power outages ranging from 2 to 12 hours per day in duration. Load shedding is common: between January 1 and December 11, 2023, there were 332 days of load-shedding — over 99 percent of the time. National energy production is highly emissions-intensive and concentrated in coal — 85 percent, or about 42,000 megawatts (MW), is generated via coal-fired power stations, many of which are aging and poorly maintained. Eskom, a state-owned enterprise, produces 95 percent of South Africa’s electricity; its energy availability factor — or the proportion of time it could produce electricity — has consistently declined over the past 10 years, from 75 percent in fiscal year (FY) 2014 to 58 percent in FY 2023, and is expected to stay below 70 percent in the medium term. The power plants’ frequent breakdowns and maintenance problems are triggering widespread blackouts across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McKinsey estimates that $400 billion of investment will be required to increase electricity transmission and distribution in Africa by 2050. Decentralized renewable energy solutions, particularly standalone solar systems and mini-grids, have become more prevalent sources of electricity, especially in rural areas where grid expansion is commercially unviable. Africa was a recipient of 70 percent of the world’s off-grid investments between 2010 and 2020. Nigeria, which has the highest absolute number of people in energy poverty worldwide, was the largest recipient in sub-Saharan Africa of off-grid renewable energy aid during this period, facilitated by the Nigerian Energy Regulation Commission’s launch of the Regulation for Mini-Grids in 2017, which created a transparent regulatory framework for mini-grid developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;insight-4-high-levels-of-debt-have-left-countries-with-very-limited-public-finance-to-invest-in-energy-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Insight 4: High levels of debt have left countries with very limited public finance to invest in energy infrastructure.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt levels have drastically increased over the last decade; the average debt-to-GDP ratio in sub-Saharan Africa nearly doubled between 2013 and 2022, from 30 percent to 60 percent of GDP. Additionally, debt servicing costs have gone up, owing partially to the fact that 40 percent of the continent’s debt is denominated in foreign currencies, which means that currency fluctuations can drastically increase repayment costs. In 2023, debt servicing costs were estimated to reach 17 percent of government revenues — the highest in 24 years. This has drastically reduced the public finances available for improvements to the energy sector and other development priorities, including education and health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt challenges are exacerbated by volatile revenue streams for resource-dependent economies. For example, Angola is reliant on oil revenue and has struggled to repay debt — including $42 billion in Chinese loans that were extended after the civil war in 2002 using future petroleum revenues as a guarantee for repayment. This approach proved effective until the decline in oil prices. In 2016, as oil prices plummeted from $115 per barrel to below $50 per barrel, Angola entered a recession, with five straight years of economic decline. Angola narrowly averted debt default amid the compounding challenges of low oil prices and the Covid-19 pandemic. Consequently, Angola has inadequate public finance to invest in energy infrastructure. On average, 43 percent of Angola’s urban population and less than 10 percent of its rural population have access to energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mining sector has financed energy generation across the continent. However, most existing power generation has been directed and financed by mining companies to supply their own operations. For example, the third phase of the DRC’s Inga Dam project is expected to generate 4,400 MW — but most of this will be used to power the copper mines and smelters in Haut-Katanga Province. Just a third of the power would be allocated to power nearby Kinshasa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;insight-5-public-utilities-are-often-ill-equipped-to-meet-energy-needs&quot;&gt;Insight 5: Public utilities are often ill-equipped to meet energy needs.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 54 countries in Africa, 25 have public utilities that monopolize the electricity sector without any private sector participation. The other 29 allow private sector participation to some degree. Only 10 countries — less than a fifth of the continent — have unbundled utilities featuring an independent transmission system operator or a statutory unbundled transmission system. Given the large share of state-owned electricity companies, high levels of debt and limited fiscal capacity undermine the utilities’ ability to make public investments in energy infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency has noted that “expanding and modernising Africa’s electricity infrastructure requires a radical improvement in the financial health of public utilities.” Staying solvent will require drastic reform to cost-of-electricity pricing to address the insolvency that continues to undermine gains in access and efficiency. Strengthening the financial health of these utilities also requires addressing financial mismanagement and corruption. In South Africa, infrastructure and coal supplies often face internal sabotage by individuals looking to contract repair work at inflated rates and theft by those looking to sell stolen parts. In 2023, the minister of finance exempted Eskom from “disclosing irregular spending in its audited annual financial statements” for a period of three years in an effort to build the company’s international credit rating. These reforms can improve not only the solvency of utilities but also the fiscal health of the country. In South Africa, Eskom has received $16 billion in bailouts since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kenya, mismanagement has adversely affected its two utilities: Kenya Power, which the government has a majority share in, for distribution and Ketraco, which is wholly state owned, for transmission. Both have struggled with poor financial performance and rising debt levels. In Madagascar, JIRAMA, the state-owned electricity and water utility, has received significant fiscal subsidies to stay solvent. Still, it has been unable to adequately increase energy access. The International Monetary Fund has flagged that limiting fiscal transfers to the energy sector can improve the country’s overall fiscal position. In 2023, the World Bank stepped in to provide support to the government of Madagascar with a $400 million line of credit, which will support strengthening access to both energy and the internet. It is expected to increase energy access from 34 percent to 67 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;insight-6-the-investment-climate-has-disincentivized-private-capital-in-the-energy-sector&quot;&gt;Insight 6: The investment climate has disincentivized private capital in the energy sector.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sub-Saharan Africa is a difficult region for the private sector to work in. In 2020, it averaged a score of 51.8 (out of 100) on the World Bank’s Doing Business index, which assesses the extent to which a country’s regulatory environment is conducive to private sector operations. Sub-Saharan Africa ranks significantly below the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) high-income economy average of 78.4 and the global average of 63.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa only received 2.4 percent of global renewable energy investment between 2010 and 2020 — of which three-fourths was concentrated in South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, and Kenya. Solar photovoltaic (PV) installations received $18 billion between 2010 and 2020, approximately a third of all renewable energy investment in the continent. Onshore wind projects received 31 percent of all investment, followed by solar thermal at 16 percent. The share of investment that went to solar technology increased from 2 percent in 2011 to 62 percent in 2012 and has stayed put in the 40–80 percent range, replacing bioenergy and small hydropower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is alignment between countries with low levels of energy access and limited ability to mobilize private capital and those that perform poorly on the Doing Business rankings. For example, the DRC has largely been unable to attract private capital given it has one of the most challenging business environments in Africa and globally. In 2020, the DRC ranked 183 out of 190 countries for the ease of doing business. It ranked in the bottom 10 percent of countries worldwide for enforcing contracts, paying taxes, trading across borders, and getting electricity. Current policies do not offer favorable investment conditions and remain ambiguous about issues such as ownership and concessions. Challenges with the creditworthiness of the offtaker utility, independent regulatory body, off-grid framework, high taxes, value-added taxes, and import duties have further disincentivized private capital mobilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa’s energy crisis has become an impediment to doing business and mobilizing capital on the continent. As Table 1 shows, sub-Saharan Africa’s score for “getting electricity” — which the World Bank calculates by measuring the “procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly constructed warehouse,” as well as the “supply reliability, transparency of tariffs and the price of electricity” — is the lowest in the world at 50.4 (out of a possible 100). This is compared to 85.9 in OECD high-income countries, 75.1 in East Asia and the Pacific, and 71.7 in Latin America and the Caribbean. The cost of electricity in the region is 3,188 percent of income per capita — the highest of any region in the world and nearly 3.5 times as much as the next highest, South Asia; over five times higher than the East Asia and the Pacific region; and over seven times higher than Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa. Many African countries that are in need of private capital to improve electricity are in a negative cycle: expanding access to, and reducing the cost of, electricity is key for improving the investment climate — but improving the investment climate requires improving access to affordable and reliable electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-addressing-africas-energy-crisis&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDRESSING AFRICA’S ENERGY CRISIS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-1-leverage-natural-gas&quot;&gt;Recommendation 1: Leverage natural gas.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite differences across states’ energy and climate plans, the African Union’s (AU) Energy Transition Program promotes a unified vision of energy development on the continent based on access to affordable and clean energy. The plan incorporates principles laid out by AU Agenda 2063, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Kigali Communique, developed by representatives from 10 states in 2022, lays out the requirements for a just and equitable energy transition in Africa and encourages international partners to align with its objectives. The communique highlights the importance of natural gas as a transition fuel in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modeling by the International Energy Agency shows that universal energy access in Africa hinges on using both renewable energy and natural gas. However, investment in renewable energy in the region has been insufficient. Africa has only received 2.4 percent of it between 2010 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital that universal energy access in Africa is achieved with the lowest emissions possible. Switching from coal to natural gas is an important mechanism for achieving both goals, given that gas emits roughly half the amount of carbon dioxide of coal when burned. The International Energy Agency has projected that leveraging Africa’s gas could result in an extra 90 billion cubic meters per year until 2030. With cooperation between governments and international companies, this gas can be used to both meet domestic demand and still be exported for revenue. The total carbon emissions from utilizing these gas resources over the next three decades is forecasted to be approximately 10 gigatons — which, when added to current emissions, would still amount to just 3.5 percent of the world’s emissions despite having a much larger share of the world’s population. Additionally, new technologies can further reduce the emissions generated from natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-2-invest-in-clean-energy-sources&quot;&gt;Recommendation 2: Invest in clean energy sources.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant financing is required to ensure African states have universal access to modern energy while concurrently meeting their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement. The International Energy Agency has stated that $200 billion per year in energy investment will be required to achieve this by 2030. This will require concessional financing; an estimated $28 billion is needed on an annual basis to mobilize $90 billion of private sector investment — 10 times as much as current financing. A concerted effort between governments, multilateral development banks, international donors, and the private sector is key to scale up clean energy investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many African countries are prioritizing renewable energy development and setting up programs to procure capital from the private sector. In 2011, South Africa developed the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program; since its inception, the program has procured 6.4 gigawatts from 112 independent power producers through seven bid windows — primarily in wind and solar. In August 2022, the Nigerian government launched the national Energy Transition Plan (ETP), which aims to have the country generate 30,000 MW of electricity from renewable energy sources and reach carbon neutrality by 2060. This process is estimated to create 340,000 jobs in the coming decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya boasts one of the most advanced power sectors in sub-Saharan Africa and has made significant strides in enhancing household access to electricity. As a result of both public and private investment, Kenya’s electricity generation capacity grew by an average of 4.9 percent per year between 2013 and 2022 — exceeding its 4.5 percent real GDP growth rate during the same time frame. In total, Kenya has experienced an electrification rate increase from 32 percent in 2013 to 75 percent in 2022. Although there is a disparity in energy access between rural and urban areas, it is smaller than most African nations, with urban energy access at 100 percent, contrasting with 65 percent in rural regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya serves as a success story of remarkable growth in renewable energy; about 90 percent of Kenya’s power comes from renewable energy, including geothermal, solar, and wind. The country shifted its baseload power from hydroelectric to geothermal, which has made the energy system more drought resistant — a critical feature given how drought-prone the Horn of Africa is. Kenya has been identified as one of the cheapest developers of geothermal power in the world. Although it currently has 863 MW of installed geothermal capacity, it has an estimated 10,000 MW geothermal energy potential. Still, Kenya is the world’s eighth largest geothermal producer and has the single biggest geothermal power plant. Kenya also has a growing solar industry, with large potential given how much direct solar radiation the country receives throughout the year. In 2021, it added 120 MW of solar power to the grid, bringing total solar capacity to 172 MW with more projects due to come online in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya also has a growing wind sector, which taps into its estimated 3,000 MW of wind power potential. The Lake Turkana Wind Power Station is the largest plant in Africa, generating 310 MW. The U.S. government, through the Development Finance Corporation, has also helped fund the Kipeto Wind Power Station, with turbines supplied by General Electric Energy. Kenya has also created a long-term vision to develop nuclear power, with power production expected to start in 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya’s success is a product of decades of private sector participation in the electricity sector through the independent power producer program it rolled out in the 1990s. The program gave 20-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) to private companies to supply Kenya Power, a partially state-owned enterprise. The PPA contract terms were investor-friendly but expensive for consumers and the government. There were two reasons for this. First, under the contracts, independent power producers were required to receive foreign-denominated payments regardless of whether the power was utilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given currency fluctuations, energy costs were volatile and susceptible to exchange-rate adjustment fees on monthly electricity bills. Second, the contracts were linked to fuel prices — so electricity bills were also vulnerable to price hikes when fuel prices increased. However, instead of terminating these contracts and deterring future investment, the government opted to let the contracts expire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country continues to have a public-private model for energy generation. The government of Kenya has a 70 percent stake in the Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), which contributes approximately two-thirds of the country’s installed capacity, while the remaining share is owned by independent power producers. The newer contracts for renewable energy — wind, solar and geothermal — have more consumer-friendly terms and have created more competitive pricing. Still, weaknesses exist with mismanagement of state-owned utilities, Ketraco and Kenya Power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-3-invest-in-grid-off-grid-and-mini-grid-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Recommendation 3: Invest in grid, off-grid, and mini-grid infrastructure.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the International Energy Agency’s Sustainable Development Scenario, three goals are concurrently reached: achieving the Paris Agreement’s commitment to keeping global warming below 2°C, reaching universal access to modern energy by 2030, and reducing energy-related air pollution and resulting illnesses and deaths. Grid, off-grid (also known as stand-alone), and mini-grid solutions have complementary roles to play in reaching these goals (Figure 3). Attaining universal energy access in sub-Saharan Africa will require building connections for 90 million people per year — a threefold increase from the current rate. Views vary on how this should be executed. Analysis by the International Energy Agency demonstrates that expanding national grids is the most economical approach for 45 percent of those getting energy access by 2030. On the other hand, in rural areas, mini-grids can offer two key benefits. First, they can provide access to communities that national grids currently cannot. Second, they can increase demand for electricity because the economic opportunities afforded by energy access coming from mini-grids can increase consumers’ ability to pay for electricity, incentivizing future grid expansion. The World Bank has estimated that bringing power to 380 million people in Africa will require spending $91 billion to build upward of 160,000 mini-grids. If mini-grid construction continues at its current pace, just 12,000 will be constructed by 2030 — less than 10 percent of projected demand — at a cost of $9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

The derived work is not endorsed by the IEA in any manner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off-grid infrastructure is controversial. While it can offer quick access to affordable electricity where grid or mini-grid connections are not economically or technically viable, a large share of respondents in a 39,000-person survey conducted in 12 African countries reported that their off-grid electricity solution was insufficient for their power needs, including over 60 percent of Rwandans with off-grid systems. Off-grid systems can power some lighting or charge a phone using solar, wind, or hydropower, but it remains highly limited. Thus, while such solutions have an important role to play in the medium term, it will be important to invest in grid infrastructure given that rapidly growing populations will increase demand for higher-energy systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-4-deregulate-the-energy-sector&quot;&gt;Recommendation 4: Deregulate the energy sector.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy deregulation is critical to encouraging the private sector to invest. This, in turn, can create competition, improve quality of service delivery, and reduce costs. It can also increase generation capacity and reduce system power losses, which adversely impact both public and private enterprises and reduce economic growth. Some African countries have moved toward deregulation. In 2021, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, acknowledging the limitations of the state-owned provider, Eskom, announced private investors would be allowed to generate up to 100 MW of electricity without requiring a license. Likewise, in June 2023, the government of Nigeria adopted the Electricity Act of 2023, which replaced the Electricity and Power Reform Act of 2005. The act introduced some key sector reforms, including including de-monopolozing the power sector by allowing states, firms, and households to generate, transmit, and distribute their electricity. As discussed earlier, Kenya’s success is a product of private sector participation in the electricity sector, alongside state-owned enterprises, since the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-5-undertake-necessary-legal-and-regulatory-reforms-to-help-mobilize-private-capital&quot;&gt;Recommendation 5: Undertake necessary legal and regulatory reforms to help mobilize private capital.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing and maintaining an effective enabling environment for public and private investment requires having a robust and transparent regulatory framework. As Power Africa points out, this should entail an autonomous and accountable regulatory institution with the explicit authority and capacity to carry out its responsibilities. Robust regulatory environments must define the responsibilities of public and private actors involved in the power sector to ensure accountability on both sides. This includes improving regulatory transparency around electricity tariffs and reducing investor risk by clarifying offtake agreements. Cost-of-service reforms to electricity pricing are also crucial; well-designed rate and tariff systems can ensure that public utilities are solvent and the private sector can operate profitably. These reforms can de-risk investments and help achieve public policy goals on both the emissions and energy access fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has expressed an ambition to play a larger role in the Arctic, citing its engagement as a “geopolitical necessity” amid increasing competition for resources and the emergence of new shipping lanes. After overtaking Russia as Europe’s biggest natural gas supplier, Norway has also encouraged energy companies to ramp up oil and gas exploration projects in remote Arctic regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flurry of activity and interest has broad geopolitical implications as countries move to secure supply of critical resources and mitigate the risk of weaponized interdependence. Most notably, the Arctic is central to Russia’s vision of a multipolar global order, primarily achieved through the development of the Northern Sea Route and investments in Arctic military capabilities. China has also described the Arctic as a “new strategic frontier” and stated its ambition to become a “polar great power” by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this edition of Northern Connections, the authors examine two topics that may reshape energy security in the European Arctic. Both illustrate how the Arctic is being affected by a set of interacting global crises: climate change and Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first essay, Arild Moe from the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Oslo, Norway, outlines Russia’s emergence as a leading global exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) amid increasing Western pressure. He explains that despite European attempts to cut off Russian gas imports, Russian LNG exports to Europe have soared. However, while Russia has weathered these headwinds in the short term, the outlook for Russian LNG remains uncertain and highly contingent on external financing, access to emerging markets, and the implementation of Western sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second essay, Anne Husebekk, Silje Elde, and Else Kristine Welde from the Centre for the Ocean and the Arctic at UiT The Arctic University of Norway examine Norway’s opportunity to establish marine business parks and sustainably leverage Arctic oceanic resources. They find that “marine co-location can strengthen Norwegian sustainability and competitiveness” in a manner that could mitigate the climate crisis “while creating positive ripple effects” for Arctic coastal communities. However, the Norwegian regulatory environment for marine business parks is currently lacking, and there should be a clear legal framework that simplifies the procedures for obtaining permits and licenses and outlines the rules for impact assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-arctic-lng-exports-from-success-to-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Russian Arctic LNG Exports: From Success to Uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Arild Moe, Fridtjof Nansen Institute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s LNG development in the Arctic and subsequent exports have been a tremendous success story for the Kremlin. Despite domestic resistance from Gazprom, the state-owned Russian gas company, the output from the Yamal LNG project grew rapidly between 2017 and 2022 from 0.3 million tons to 21 million tons. Even the European Union’s ambition of becoming independent of Russian energy, as well as the gas trade disruptions since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have not hurt LNG exports to Europe. On the contrary, they have soared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia has weathered these headwinds so far, uncertainty looms in the future for the Russian LNG industry. U.S. and European leaders are increasingly paying attention. Although the Arctic LNG 2 project is targeting non-Western markets such as China and India, it has become the focus of recently introduced U.S. sanctions aiming to curtail further Russian LNG development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-russian-lng-breakthrough&quot;&gt;The Russian LNG Breakthrough&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the surge in U.S. shale gas production, Russia was the world’s largest producer and exporter of natural gas. Russia has vast gas resources and an extensive pipeline network that has connected gas fields in West Siberia with domestic consumers in western Russia and lucrative export markets in Europe. Gazprom, which held a monopoly on pipeline exports, thus had no need to prioritize LNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, one major LNG project was realized. The Sakhalin-2 offshore project in far eastern Russia was developed by a consortium between Dutch company Shell and Japanese partners operating under a production-sharing agreement from the mid-1990s. Although the consortium was forced to sell a majority stake to Gazprom in 2006, operationally and technologically the project continued to be dominated by the foreign partners. Gazprom also partnered with France’s Total (now TotalEnergies) and Norway’s Statoil (now Equinor) for the Shtokman field, a major gas development in the Barents Sea. But after several years of planning, the project was shelved in 2012 due to spiking costs and a deteriorated market outlook caused by the growing development of U.S. shale gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough for Russian LNG came from another quarter. Gas company Novatek was privately owned but had good contacts with the Kremlin through one of its main owners, Gennady Timchenko. In 2009, the company acquired control of licenses for gas fields destined for LNG on the eastern side of the Yamal Peninsula in West Siberia. It involved Total — and, since 2013, China National Petroleum Corporation — as a partner in what became the Yamal LNG project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, the plan was to use Gazprom as an agent for export sales, but financial backers demanded that the project have direct export access. This prompted Novatek to lobby for a legislative amendment allowing direct sales to foreign markets, making a serious dent in Gazprom’s export monopoly. After Western sanctions were imposed on Russian energy projects in 2014 in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and support to separatists in eastern Ukraine, China’s role in the Yamal LNG project increased, with the Silk Road Fund becoming a direct investor and a greater share of financing and equipment coming from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;an-arctic-lng-success-story&quot;&gt;An Arctic LNG Success Story&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the surprise of many observers, the Yamal LNG project was completed on time and on budget in December 2017 at a total cost of approximately $27 billion. Along with the liquefaction plant in the port of Sabetta on the Yamal Peninsula, 15 300-meter-long ice-breaking LNG carriers were custom-built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp;amp; Marine Engineering (now known as Hanwha Ocean) yard in South Korea, to be owned and operated by international shipping consortia. The plant rapidly reached a nameplate capacity of 16.5 million metric tons per year from the first three production units, rising to 21 million tons in 2022 after adding an extra unit. The Russian government had been very supportive of the project, helping finance port infrastructure and providing tax concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of the project led to a reassessment of the role of LNG in Russia’s overall gas strategy. Even though Russian pipeline gas exports had been increasing every year, the outlook for further growth in sales to Europe, the most lucrative market, looked bleak because of stagnating demand. Pipeline exports to China were becoming important in volume terms but were not as profitable. LNG, by contrast, offered access to premium markets worldwide. The gas fields in the Arctic made it possible to direct exports both westward and eastward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, tensions with Gazprom increased since Yamal LNG sold gas not only in markets outside the reach of Russian gas pipelines, as initially promised, but also in Gazprom’s core markets in Europe. Moscow also exempted LNG from export and mineral extraction taxes as part of the incentives provided to develop the industry. According to Gazprom, this made competition with pipeline gas unfair, leading to unsuccessful attempts by the state-owned giant to restrict further liberalization of LNG exports. In fact, Novatek had secured licenses for several fields on the Gydan Peninsula — across the Ob Bay from Sabetta on the Yamal Peninsula — and prepared a series of LNG projects that would bring total output up to 70 million tons by 2030. With plans to expand further in the long term, these initiatives would cement the region as a major global source of LNG. The first of these projects, Arctic LNG 2, secured initial investments in fall 2019, with a Japanese consortium, Total, and two Chinese companies signing up as partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-lng-exports-in-the-shadow-of-war&quot;&gt;Russian LNG Exports in the Shadow of War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the Russian LNG strategy looked credible and sustainable, with Novatek as the lead actor and Gazprom also developing smaller LNG projects. Shortly after the start of the war, the European Union declared that it aimed to cut imports of Russian gas by two-thirds before the end of 2022. The European Union did not introduce sanctions against Russian gas per se, but several member countries ruled out new purchases of Russian pipeline gas. Moscow, however, saw cuts in exports to Europe as a tool to create economic disruption and coerce governments to limit their support for Ukraine and sanctions against the Kremlin. Russia used various means to curb pipeline exports, such as new payment arrangements and alleged pipeline repair needs — while maintaining that existing gas contracts were honored. Yet the explosions on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines under the Baltic Sea in September 2022 effectively took out a big chunk of the physical export capacity. As a result of these disruptions, Russian pipeline deliveries to EU countries were slashed by 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following these changes to the European energy market, LNG exports from Yamal soared. In fact, the lion’s share of output in 2022, some 15 million tons, was sold in Europe — contributing to the desperately needed diversification of gas supplies caused by the cuts in pipelines gas deliveries from Russia. The picture was the same in 2023. Due to the extraordinarily high gas prices in Europe in 2022 and 2023, the sellers of Russian LNG have enjoyed huge windfall profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This result has been a surprise to many observers and politicians since the European Union has a stated ambition of denying Russia income that could fuel the war and of ending Europe’s dependence on Russian gas supplies. Defenders of continued LNG imports argue that Russian LNG has been a relief in a difficult supply situation and has helped avert the European economic crisis that Putin had hoped for. Another argument is that less income from LNG exports ends up in Russian state coffers than from pipeline gas since LNG taxes are far less substantial. Besides, much of the Russian LNG sold belongs to foreign companies. Still, powerful voices within the European Union continue to call for curtailing imports of Russian LNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may also seem surprising to some that Russia has not stopped LNG exports to Europe, given that it wanted to destabilize European economies. There could be several reasons for this. Unlike the pipeline gas sold by Gazprom export arm Gazexport, which remains controlled by the state, LNG from Yamal is sold by the owners, including TotalEnergies, CNPC, Novatek, and other companies with long-term contracts for offtaking gas. They usually sell their gas through traders who deal with the importers. Moscow ordering a stop of gas sales from Yamal LNG to Europe would involve breaching chains of contractual arrangements and create a major commercial conflict with key partners in Russian LNG development. Not interrupting sales is also extremely important for the standing of Russian LNG globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;outlook-for-russian-lng&quot;&gt;Outlook for Russian LNG&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the European market for Russian pipeline gas disappearing and unlikely to recover even after the war in Ukraine is over, Russian hopes are now pinned on LNG. This includes the continuation of sales to Europe, which constitute only a fraction of the previous volume sold via pipeline, as well as new markets in other parts of the world such as South America and India. It has particularly high expectations regarding the LNG-hungry economies of Japan, South Korea, and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the outlook for Russian LNG does not only depend on Russia’s performance. Technology sanctions are hitting the sector, delaying implementation of Novatek’s bold expansion plans — even though Russian and Chinese replacement technology permitted the project to come onstream at the end of 2023. But further development also requires financing. Western investments are of course out of the question, and Chinese investors may find that the risk associated with new Russian hydrocarbon projects is too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market access for Russian LNG is a major uncertainty. Although the United States had imported very little natural gas from Russia, Washington imposed an import ban on Russian gas shortly after the war in Ukraine broke out. New U.S. sanctions outlined in November 2023 leave current supplies from Yamal LNG untouched but do aim to stop companies worldwide from buying gas from Arctic LNG 2 (expected to start producing in early 2024), thus denying Russia new revenue streams. One expressed U.S. goal is to derail Russian plans for LNG expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementation of these sanctions, together with continued technology and financial restrictions, will undoubtedly have serious consequences for Russia’s LNG development. This holds true even if Russian owners succeed at selling more LNG to China and perhaps India. The longer-term outlook for Russian LNG will depend on the outcome of the war in Ukraine and domestic developments in Russia. As of now, the prospects for the reintegration of Russia into the global energy economy are highly uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;marine-business-parks-can-nature-and-industries-be-balanced-at-sea&quot;&gt;Marine Business Parks: Can Nature and Industries Be Balanced at Sea?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Anne Husebekk, Silje Elde, and Else Kristine Welde, Centre for the Ocean and the Arctic at UiT The Arctic University of Norway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fisheries, aquaculture, and offshore and subsea energy sources have long dominated popular conceptions of the use of the ocean in the Arctic. However, despite the vastness of the ocean and the significant long-term potential of both seafood and sea energy, it is the maritime areas close to coastlines that are most useful for the people living there. In these areas, activities compete for space. The Center for the Ocean and the Centre for the Ocean and the Arctic at UiT The Arctic University of Norway recently presented a policy brief to the Norwegian Minister of Fisheries and Ocean Policy, Cecilie Myrseth. The document provides specific recommendations on “how marine co-location can strengthen Norwegian sustainability and competitiveness” in a manner that mitigates the climate crisis “while creating positive ripple effects for nearby coastal communities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-marine-business-parks-are-significant&quot;&gt;Why Marine Business Parks Are Significant&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marine business parks are areas where at least two ocean activities are located together and benefit from each other. One example could be colocating offshore wind turbines providing renewable energy for land-based use and electric ships, carbon-capture projects for industrial storage and use, and seaweed, mussel, or oyster farming. Such a model would deliver cost savings for all stakeholders involved and reduce water pollution. Establishing marine business parks requires cooperation between several actors to plan the parks, harmonize regulations, collaborate with local governments, ensure businesses see the long-term benefits, and consult with external stakeholders. These external stakeholders could be local fishers who have knowledge in areas of specific interest for fisheries and can advise on where such parks could be established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-to-establish-marine-business-parks-in-norway-today&quot;&gt;How to Establish Marine Business Parks in Norway Today&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Norwegian regulatory framework complicates the establishment of marine business parks because they span several industries, types of businesses, and policy areas across multiple municipalities. Therefore, they require harmonizing regulations covering these sectors and government entities. As explained in the policy brief, “A clear legal framework must be established that simplifies the procedures for obtaining permits, licenses and rules for impact assessments for marine business parks. At the same time, the environmental requirements for impact assessments and licenses must not be reduced, and the body dealing with this must possess considerable environmental expertise.” According to the center’s preliminary study on marine business parks, in Norway this legislation “must include both the licensing process (granting of permits), provisions regarding impact assessments, regulation of technical conditions (if a multipurpose platform is to be used), as well as provisions concerning health, safety, and environment (HSE). Furthermore, a tax and duties regime must be designed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permanent marine business parks cannot be established until more research and innovation has taken place. In the long term, aspects such as pollution, the implications for the surrounding marine ecology, the influence of technological installations, and economic returns will vary depending on the specific environment and businesses involved with each park. This research and innovation should therefore analyze the topic through the lenses of biology, technology, economy, and social sciences in an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates stakeholders from coastal municipalities and the private sector, not just academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-sustainable-business-development-in-the-ocean&quot;&gt;Future Sustainable Business Development in the Ocean&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the severe ongoing climate and nature crisis affecting Arctic areas, the establishment of maritime businesses needs to be handled with care. There is a fine balance between conserving and exploiting the ocean and between traditional fishing and new businesses such as aquaculture, oil and gas exploitation, offshore wind power, and seabed mining. Policymakers and private sector stakeholders should pay attention to the global demand for food and energy, the health of the ocean, and the well-being of populations living on the coast before planning for the sustainable development of ocean businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, combining ocean businesses in multiuse parks could reduce the oceanic areas in use, develop relationships among private sector stakeholders, and free up resources to protect biodiversity. The sustainable use of ocean resources would contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals related to hunger, energy, climate, and oceans. However, no municipality, region, or nation can solve this problem by itself. If maritime business parks are shown to be the most sustainable way of organizing ocean businesses, then international regulations and cooperation will be required. In this context, several international projects are exploring multiuse parks in the ocean with an array of involved stakeholders and regulatory frameworks. Among them is UNITED, an EU- and industry-funded project that “aims to provide evidence of the viability of ocean multi-use through the development of five real-life ocean multi-use pilots that combine different marine activities.” This project is exploring the economic, environmental, societal, legal, and technological aspects of marine business parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of ongoing activities, more research and investments are needed to ensure the long-term viability of marine business parks. The Norwegian government is uniquely positioned to finance such projects to explore their functionality, effects, economic profitability, and impact on the health of oceans and coastal populations. The Centre for the Ocean and the Arctic at UiT The Arctic University of Norway stands ready to advise the government throughout this process and provide a forum for dialogue on marine colocation issues in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;張劍虹：個人認為《蘋果》就暴力和示威觀點「有問題」 但作為社長需執行黎智英政策&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;庭上播員工大會錄音 張劍虹發言籲繼續報導 「我哋唔係犯罪組織」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GtFxjTQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（30日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第19日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。辯方盤問時指，《蘋果》從沒有支持「黃店」，而「黃色經濟圈」與黎信奉自由市場相違背。辯方指出，黎智英一直以來都呼籲人和平示威，惟張不同意。辯方追問張是否認為《蘋果》有些文章就暴力和示威的觀點是不恰當，張承認：「個人覺得有問題，但我作為《蘋果日報》社長，梗係要執行黎生嘅政策。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎認為黃色經濟圈要存在-辯方與黎相信自由市場違背&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎認為「黃色經濟圈」要存在 辯方：與黎相信自由市場違背&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張昨天提到黎曾在《飲食男女》的「飯盒會」中指示員工訪問「黃店」和小店，張今確認黎曾指示廣告部推行「撐小店分類廣告計劃」。辯方問到是否因為《蘋果》失去商業型廣告商，所以嘗試找其他廣告客戶來替代，張指：「呢個係一個講法啦，但呢啲廣告好難賺到錢」，而且計劃推行大半年也未有向小店收取費用。張指黎初初指示免費試行，但未有提到何時開始收錢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問張「撐小店分類廣告計劃」是否一項潛在收入來源。張不同意，因他認為計劃不能賺錢，事實上也是每月虧蝕。他又指以黎多年做生意的經驗，會知道小店分類廣告比起大型廣告，是不能賺錢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指出，事實上該計劃目的是支持「小店」而非「黃店」。張則指計劃名稱的確是「撐小店」，只不過大部份「黃店」都是「小店」。他又憶述：「黎生都講過一日有抗爭呢個情況，一日都要有黃色經濟圈存在」，但在沒有抗爭的情況下，就主張自由經濟。辯方則指黎從沒有說過上述言論，張否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指「黃色經濟圈」與黎所相信的「自由市場理論」相違背，張同意相信自由市場是黎的核心價值，「所以黎生咪一路都講，如果冇抗爭就唔需要呢樣嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方再指出，「撐小店分類廣告計劃」目的只是支持小店，而《蘋果》從來沒有支持「黃店」。張表示：「呢個唔同意，呢個計劃個名唔係叫撐黃店，但黎生係咁嘅意思。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄺頌晴文章提黃色經濟圈-辯方僅個人意見&quot;&gt;鄺頌晴文章提「黃色經濟圈」 辯方：僅個人意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示鄺頒晴撰寫的英文評論文章「Round-up of all opposition politicians the HK version of Kaohisung Incident」（圍捕所有反對派，港版美麗島事件），於2021年1月14日刊於英文版網站。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指張上周閱畢此文章後，提起「黃色經濟圈」，惟文章的底下展示一段聲明，稱《蘋果日報》保留拒絕投稿、修改稿件或撤銷刊登的權利，反映文章觀點不一定與《蘋果》編輯一致。張則指很多節目都有類似聲明「呢個係嘉賓意見，唔代表本台立場」，以避免訴訟或被控誹謗。他重申編輯揀選評論文章時，需根據黎所定的準則，即「偏黃」、符合《蘋果日報》和支持香港的觀點，不可以對中國有正面內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指出，鄺的文章提及「黃色經濟圈」的部份，只是她的個人意見，張同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張確認，當他和黎智英向負責管理英文版的楊清奇推薦作者時，便「等同係吩咐」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方若時評文章太偏激-蘋果會減刊登次數&quot;&gt;辯方：若時評文章太偏激 《蘋果》會減刊登次數&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，若《蘋果日報》認為某些作者的評論文章過於偏激，會削減文章刊登次數，並展示WhatsApp 對話，當中張向黎提出：「古德明我想可以減少一天」，黎回覆：「對，可減他一兩天，他有時太偏激。」辯方問張，黎是否因為古的文章過於偏激而減他的刊登次數。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張卻稱：「其實我唔清楚黎生講呢句嘢係咩意思」，又補充古德明的專欄是在副刊而非港聞版。張指，黎當時邀請顏純鈎替《蘋果》撰寫評論文章，所以要騰出版面空位給顏，故張才會提議減少古的文章，而黎亦同意減少一兩天，「佢（黎）話佢（古）太偏激，但我唔太明佢意思」，但張沒有就此追問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎智英主張和平示威-張不同意後期愈趨暴力-黎倡和勇不分&quot;&gt;辯方：黎智英主張和平示威 張不同意：後期愈趨暴力 黎倡和勇不分&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指出，黎智英一直以來都呼籲人和平示威，惟張不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示2019年6月15日頭版「惡法擬暫緩但不撤，遊行前夕，林鄭緩兵，明天照上街」、2019年7月1日頭版「惡法未撤回，林鄭未下台，今日再上街」及2019年8月14日頭版「民陣籲8.18上街，良知哂冷」，上述三次集會或遊行事前均獲警方發出「不反對通知書」，反映黎一向呼籲市民和平示威。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，該些呼籲是《蘋果日報》作出，而不是黎智英，問辯方是否打算將黎智英等同於《蘋果日報》？辯方確認，並問張是否同意《蘋果》一向呼籲和平示威。張則指：「因為（反修例事件）後來暴力愈來愈犀利，黎生立場覺得和勇要不分，嗰時《蘋果日報》亦跟住黎生嘅立場，對暴力嘅嘢係照刊登囉，都係用一個比較同情，同支持抗爭者嘅角度去評論囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹承認個人認為蘋果暴力和示威方面觀點有問題-但作為社長需執行黎政策&quot;&gt;張劍虹承認個人認為《蘋果》暴力和示威方面觀點「有問題」 但作為社長需執行黎政策&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問張是否在某些時候覺得《蘋果》有些文章和觀點是不恰當，例如就暴力和示威範疇。張承認：「個人覺得有問題，但我作為《蘋果日報》社長，梗係要執行黎生嘅政策。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示張劍虹與楊清奇之間的對話，2019年11月14日，張向楊稱：「主筆，我想我們都要明確點重申我們的立場，潑易燃液體燒阿叔、燒法院等行為，我們認為過了份」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2021年4月17日，張向楊稱：「主筆，今日跟顏先生傾，黑警等字我們還是不要用較好。他請我們幫忙把關，我想這要麻煩你。謝謝」、「現在這個時勢，黑警等詞，還是不用較好。」張指當中提及的「顏先生」是顏純鈎，最初他替《蘋果》撰寫評論文章，但其後黎認為顏的文章寫得好，便邀請他撰寫《蘋果》社論，筆名為「方圓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/if18D9t.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（30日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第19日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。辯方指黎智英於2021年5月被捕後，高層收到很多員工查詢，於是召開全體員工大會釋疑。庭上播放張劍虹發言的錄音，張向一眾員工保證《蘋果》不會主動關閉，因「我哋唔係犯罪組織，我哋係做新聞架嘛」，呼籲一眾員工「News as usual, business as usual」。張確認當時的發言反映他所相信的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方陳方安生會見彭斯林榮基赴台-乃值得報導-張劍虹認同&quot;&gt;辯方：陳方安生會見彭斯、林榮基赴台 乃值得報導 張劍虹認同&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹早前主問提到，黎智英在2019年3月指示他報導前政務司司長陳方安生與時任美國副總統彭斯會面，並吩咐要做到最大效果。在辯方盤問下，張認同此為值得報導的事件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，不只《蘋果日報》，其他傳媒也有報導是次會面，包括《星島日報》、《南華早報》和《大公報》，當然《大公報》以截然不同的角度來報導同一事件。辯方指不同傳媒有不同的報導角度，問張是否覺得沒有問題。張思考數秒後，回答「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，就前銅鑼灣書店店長林榮基在《逃犯條例》修訂之前赴台定居一事，張亦認同「本身係社會事件，係值得報導。」辯方指除了《蘋果日報》之外，《星島日報》、《南華早報》和《大公報》亦有報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方陳沛敏早已決定林榮基報導放頭版-因提供線報者要求-而非張劍虹轉達黎指示&quot;&gt;辯方：陳沛敏早已決定林榮基報導放頭版 因提供線報者要求 而非張劍虹轉達黎指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指出，在張於台灣訪問林榮基之前，前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏早已決定將林的新聞放在頭條，而不是因為張開聲叫陳放頭條。惟張堅稱，有叫陳將報導放頭版，因黎表示想林的報導放在頭版，但欠一個訪問，所以張將訊息轉達給陳。張稱記憶中他訪問完林之後便WhatsApp 陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張記得黎之所以知道林前往台灣，是因為一名香港電台記者提供線報。辯方問張知不知道，當時該香港電台記者提供線報的條件是要求《蘋果》頭版報導。張表示不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎沒有打算隨報附送反送中長幡-質疑張調整證供以指證黎&quot;&gt;辯方：黎沒有打算隨報附送反送中長幡 質疑張調整證供以指證黎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張早前證供稱黎智英指示印製十萬張「反送中」長幡，於2019年6月15日隨報附送。不過辯方反駁指，黎本來沒有打算將長幡夾附在報紙中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰從訊息紀錄指出，黎似乎只提及把長幡提供給泛民，著黃偉強處理，但沒有要求這些長幡夾附在報紙，其後似乎是張提議將其中4萬張長幡夾附在報紙派送，問張提出這主意的人是黎還是他本人。張則指：「我可以話呢個並唔係我嘅主意」，至於他曾在訊息中提及該主意，是因為想向黎請示，「明天是否隨報附送4萬，後天6萬，兩天總共10萬」，而黎並沒有指正他，只問：「需要這麼多嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎指示過該些長幡不要加上《蘋果》標誌，張確認。辯方續指，既然如此，張應毫無疑問地知道該些長幡不會夾附在報紙派發。辯方質疑，張調整自己的證供，以指證黎，然而訊息紀錄卻不支持張的說法。張否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張供稱黎致電指示報導網上節目內容-辯方沒有發生&quot;&gt;張供稱黎致電指示報導網上節目內容 辯方：沒有發生&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹早前供稱，黎智英出席何俊仁主持的網上節目「細說中南海」後，曾致電吩咐他報導節目內容及「做大佢」，包括黎談及與時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧會面，蓬佩奧問黎：「美國可以怎樣做？」黎則回答美國可以實施制裁，讓中國官員知道其所作所為會有後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方盤問時指出，黎根本沒有打過電話給張，上述電話對話亦沒有發生過。張不同意，他堅稱：「有呀，黎先生有打過俾我，話佢喺何俊仁節目度講過會見蓬佩奧。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎希望網上節目涵蓋日常生活-張提議利用節目告訴歷史真相&quot;&gt;辯方：黎希望網上節目涵蓋日常生活 張提議利用節目告訴歷史真相&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張早前提及《蘋果》網上對談節目（Video talk），會邀請反對派人士做訪問。惟辯方盤問時指出，這並非對談節目的重點。張不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示WhatsApp 訊息紀錄，並指黎僅提議節目主題可涵蓋烹飪、寵物、健康和親子等，而沒有提及邀請反對派人士。張僅指：「呢個訊息冇囉。」辯方指出，黎是希望可以製作關於日常生活的影片，張表示：「唔同意，唔會係咁囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示另一段WhatsApp 訊息，張在訊息中稱：「香港變天，我們要做的東西很多，國教殺到，歷史科首當其衝，我已經請敏、Nick（張志偉）和偉光可以找專業人士，用專題、Video talk 將歷史真相告訴讀者和下一代」，黎回覆：「很好，你來領導，做到最好，謝謝」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指出，上述訊息反映，提議將節目轉型至政治性質的人是張劍虹。張否認，他指當時只是提議加插某類題目，而不是將節目性質轉變成歷史節目。但辯方問張會否同意他的提議是關於保存某些觀點（preserving a particular point of view），張同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張引述黎稱我一定去到盡-辯方指該些對話不存在&quot;&gt;張引述黎稱「我一定去到盡」 辯方指該些對話不存在&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關於《蘋果》英文版，辯方從訊息紀錄指出，黎智英認為美國人較有興趣看中國大陸先進人士文章，以及人權、維權和中共專制的報導；他又希望中國大陸新聞內容要高質，以及要向外國人提供《南華早報》不會報導的觀點，以打破《南華早報》的壟斷，因此黎才會在「English news」群組內指示不需要作平衡報導。惟張不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張早前供稱黎不同意英文版添加香港逆權和中國新聞以外的文章。辯方展示另一則訊息，黎智英向張劍虹和馮偉光表示：「我們新聞數目太少，沒有critical mass 吸引讀者，應想想辦法增加，或可增加一些財經新聞？但時事新聞肯（定）要增加。謝謝」，反映黎曾提議引入財經新聞。張則指：「就算係財經新聞，都要係負面嘅」，又指即使黎指示增加新聞數量，也不允許一般性新聞，正如早前他提及馮偉光提議加入其他類型文章，黎卻不准許，認為會沖淡（dilute）英文版的原意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關於「一人一信救香港」，張劍虹曾供稱2020年中央宣布將會實施港區國安法後，黎致電給張，吩咐他籌備「一人一信救香港」行動。辯方則指出，該通電話並不存在，而黎所有指示均是經訊息發出。張不同意，並堅稱黎有致電他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關於網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，辯方指出，黎從沒告訴張打算邀請什麼嘉賓，而張早前供稱黎說「最近啲嘉賓都好猛」，張就邀請美國退休軍官Jack Keane表達憂慮，之後黎回應以他多年做生意的經驗和直覺，「佢哋（中共）咁搞我，我一定去到盡」，辯方則指上述對話沒有發生過。張不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指國家領導人對話也可被視為國際壓力-張指此非黎當時想法&quot;&gt;辯方指國家領導人對話也可被視為「國際壓力」 張指此非黎當時想法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「一人一信救香港」，辯方指行動目的是請求中央慎重考慮實施港區國安法此等「災難性措施」。法官杜麗冰打斷，指請願信是寄給時任美國總統特朗普，看不到行動的請求對象是中央。辯方則表示會在結案陳詞中處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問張，實施港區國安法是否一項「災難性措施」，張指「黎生係咁覺得」。辯方追問張的個人看法，張表示：「我都覺得（國安法是）會影響香港好多人權的法例嚟架。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，可以有不同的方式作國際施壓，例如國家領導人之間對話或一則電話通話，也可被視為「國際壓力」，問張是否同意。張則指：「係，但黎生當時諗嘅唔係普通嘅國際壓力」，又指「啫係我覺得當時黎生唔係講緊呢啲嘢囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方特朗普與習近平關係良好-張劍虹黎一直覺得特朗普夠膽對抗中國&quot;&gt;辯方：特朗普與習近平關係良好 張劍虹：黎一直覺得特朗普夠膽對抗中國&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指特朗普與習近平關係良好，遂展示新聞報導，引述特朗普聲稱他支持香港，同時支持中國國家主席習近平，又形容習是他的朋友、了不起的人。（I’ll tell you we have to stand with Hong Kong but I’m also standing with President Xi. He is a friend of mine he is an incredible guy）特朗普又稱「沒有我，香港便會在14分鐘內被毀滅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指「一人一信救香港」的目的是指出國安法立法有何缺失之處。張不同意：「睇唔到兩者有咩關係囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰引述報導內容指，特朗普稱「只有少數國家領袖願意對抗中國」，質疑辯方說法：「難道特朗普有意與習近平友好對話嗎？」張表示：「唔係咁囉」，並指黎一直覺得特朗普夠膽對抗中國，好讚揚他的單邊主義，敢於打貿易戰，「逼佢（中國）服從西方價值觀」，因此相信「一人一信」的意思是對抗中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示已故專欄作家李怡的文章《攬炒的最佳時機》，指整篇文章來看，李怡純粹描述示威事件，而不是主張制裁和「攬炒」。惟張認為李怡是對制裁和「攬炒」作出肯定，而非純粹描述。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方播員工大會錄音-張劍虹當時呼籲員工繼續報導我哋唔係犯罪組織&quot;&gt;辯方播員工大會錄音 張劍虹當時呼籲員工繼續報導「我哋唔係犯罪組織」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎智英於2021年5月被捕後，高層收到很多員工的查詢，於是在5月11日召開大會，邀請全體員工出席。張確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方庭上播放一段張劍虹的發言錄音，張在大會中表示，外界有很多傳聞指《蘋果日報》在7月1日便會「執笠」，他直指該些傳言「好荒謬囉」，強調「《蘋果日報》係唔會自己執笠囉，唔會了斷」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續表示：「我哋唔係犯法，我哋唔係犯罪組織，我哋係做新聞架嘛」，呼籲一眾員工「News as usual, business as usual」，錄音背景傳來鼓掌聲。至於有關壹傳媒大樓租約和法律程序的問題，張稱公司會據理力爭，假使真的被收地，也會在外面租用地方，張向大家保證不會令公司執笠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張接著引述黎的獄中信，寄語員工：「新聞自由的工作是危險的，大家同事保重，盡量要小心。」張呼籲員工報導時要「少情緒」，及盡量不要放太多情緒落報導中。他最後指「《蘋果日報》唔可以褪呔，有咁多香港人支持」，重申公司運作無問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，張非常清楚地知道他和其他員工所做的事只是報導新聞，並沒有觸犯法律，正如他在大會中所說「我哋唔係犯罪組織」，而壹傳媒集團一向致力確保守法。張確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，張當時的發言反映他所相信的，張同意。辯方又指，張引述黎獄中信的內容，是提醒員工不要觸犯法例。張表示不敢解讀黎的說話，但他理解黎的意思只是「呢個時勢要小心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方盤問未完，案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

This Analysis aims to provide a balanced assessment of the state of IS-K in the face of the Taliban’s efforts to crush it, but also other challenges it has been facing. The focus of this piece is to examine IS-K’s efforts to adapt to unfavourable developments and how it managed to preserve its core structure despite losses and setbacks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-ks-declining-activities&quot;&gt;IS-K’s declining activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common metric of success and failure in counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency is the level of violent activities. On this basis, it could be argued that the Taliban were successful in handling the Islamic State in Khorasan (IS-K) threat. During 2023 IS-K attacks almost came to a halt. In April and May, there was not a single confirmed attack. From June to September, IS-K was only able to carry out one or two attacks per month, including gunfire attacks on Taliban patrols. From October, there was a modest resurgence, but even then, only four confirmed attacks took place in the month, including two involving explosives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is certainly a solid rationale for using the level of violent activities as a metric. A violent extremist organisation can ill afford to go quiet, especially after having launched its campaign and carried it out for years. Inevitably, inactivity will be perceived by members, prospective members, and sympathisers as a sign of decline or at least an organisation in trouble. Recruitment is likely to be affected and fundraising even more so. This may be especially true of an organisation like IS-K, which never raised much funding locally and has been dependent on funds coming from outside Afghanistan. Why would a “donor” want to fund an organisation which has fallen below the radar screen and whose fate looks uncertain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, in the case of the Taliban’s Emirate in Afghanistan as in the case of any other counter-terrorism effort, there is in reality no necessarily causal relationship between counter-terrorist operations and the level of activity of insurgents and terrorists. Any decline in the level of activity can be due to multiple causes. In the case of IS-K, sources within the organisation acknowledged during 2023 that Taliban raids against IS-K hideouts in the cities had taken a heavy toll. After indulging in rather indiscriminate repression in their first few months in power, the Taliban’s counter-terrorism effort has largely been intelligence-led throughout 2022 and 2023. This allowed them to be “surgical” in their strikes against IS-K, as they themselves say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-ks-funding-crisis&quot;&gt;IS-K’s funding crisis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same sources, however, also hinted at (at least) another, even more important factor behind the decline in their level of activity. Funding for IS-K started declining already in 2018, due to the downwards trajectory taken by their mother organisation - the Caliphate (IS Central). The drop in funds accrued from the central IS structure continued with some ups and downs through to 2023. As discussed in a forthcoming paper based on multiple local sources, at one point in early 2023 funding almost completely stopped accruing in the coffers of IS-K. Aside from the constantly declining resources that IS Central could allocate to its Khorasan branch, the crisis was compounded by a persistent crackdown by the Turkish authorities on all IS branches present on their territory, including IS-K. For years, the main financial hub of IS-K has been in Turkey, where, thanks to the growing Afghan community, informal banking connections were becoming common. Turkey was also a major financial hub for IS Central, thus making the transfer of funds between the two very easy. As detailed in a previous report, the Turkish crackdown led to tens of IS-K members being detained, and seriously disrupted their operations. The Taliban contributed to compounding IS-Ks’ financial crisis by increasing their monitoring of financial flows and warning hawala traders in Afghanistan of the consequences of getting caught transferring IS-K cash. In the first half of 2023, IS-K ended up not even being able to pay salaries and logistics to its men on the ground in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K gradually managed to cope to some extent with the Turkish crackdown, relocating financial operations to alternative locations, and sought to diversify its sources of revenue away from the struggling IS Central, with limited success. Sources in the informal banking sector, contacted by the author’s research team in August 2023 and again in January 2024, indicated that tightened Taliban monitoring of informal banking was in part neutralised by avoiding the transfer of big sums and relying instead on multiple transfers of small amounts, which could be disguised as remittances. As a result, a complete financial choke off was averted, even if funding remained at low levels even compared to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the deep financial crisis of 2023, IS-K leadership did not lay idly, waiting for financial flows to be restored. Internal sources explain that IS-K continued restructuring organisationally and transitioned towards a fully underground system, under the assumption that it will not be able to control significant chunks of territory for the foreseeable future. Mobile bases and training camps and small cells have now become the norm throughout IS-K’s structure in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-prospects-of-is-k-resurgence&quot;&gt;The prospects of IS-K resurgence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce the negative effects of its very low level of activities in the field, IS-K expanded its online propaganda and recruitment activities. Although at the peak of its financial crisis in the first half of 2023 the propaganda activities declined, overall IS-K was able to give the impression of a proactive and resilient organisation and to magnify the significance of its few and intermittent attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Propaganda alone, of course, will not rescue IS-K. In the longer term, the potential for an IS-K resurgence will depend on a series of developments and their interplay including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;whether the 2022/2023 alignment of negative circumstances affecting funding (the decline of IS-Central, the Turkish, and Taliban crackdowns on their finances) dissolves or is somehow bypassed;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;whether IS-K can avoid or contain organisational decay while it struggles financially and is able to carry out only a negligible level of military activities;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;whether the relative unity of the Taliban in facing IS-K is superseded by growing Taliban infighting;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;whether the Taliban fails to address weak spots in their counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency campaigns; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;whether new opportunities for fundraising and recruitment arise out of developments over which IS-K has little control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, IS-K managed to re-establish some financial flows in the latter part of 2023. These will not suffice for a full re-launch of IS-K and the organisation will have to figure out how and where to raise more. IS-K was proactive in trying to prevent organisational decay. It is hard to assess how successful that was, although internal sources acknowledge some decline in membership numbers between the second half of 2022 and the second half of 2023. While the Taliban continue to suffer from internal divisions, as of the end 2023, there had not been any major split that could set IS-K on an altogether different trajectory. It is worth noting, however, that tension between the leadership and the Tajik Taliban of the north-east was growing fast in late 2023 and early 2024. Taliban sources, contacted by the author’s research team in October 2023, reported cases of Tajik Taliban members being detained on allegations of having links to IS-K, which at least partially confirms IS-K might just be starting to make some inroads there. Disgruntled Tajik Taliban, therefore, could offer some opportunity for the terrorist group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations-of-the-talibans-counter-terrorism&quot;&gt;Limitations of the Taliban’s counter-terrorism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K can also be reasonably confident that the Taliban’s counter-terrorism effort will remain focused on repression, however “surgical”, and on financial interdiction. Even here, one can see some cracks in the Taliban’s approach: checks on the informal banking sector remain superficial, as the Taliban seemingly do not want to disrupt the sector, which is vital to the Afghan economy and possibly to the Taliban themselves. More importantly, despite successful experiments in Nangarhar province, the Taliban seem to have no intention of pursuing local reconciliation deals with communities connected to IS-K, nor of offering the Salafi community, which has been a major source of support for IS-K, some kind of integration into the Emirate’s structure, even at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another weak spot of the Taliban’s counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency is that it is poorly resourced. Although the Taliban keep adding manpower to both army and police, they lack advanced equipment. While they are not strong believers in technology, the Taliban believe that they would certainly benefit from some more airlift capabilities and from drones, especially for mountain operations. They might make progress in this direction in the not-so-distant future, as the Emirate by the end of 2023 looked close to obtaining China’s diplomatic recognition, which might be followed by some other countries in the region and would considerably improve the Taliban’s chances of obtaining some military supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-potential-recruitment-pool-of-foreign-jihadists-in-afghanistan&quot;&gt;The potential recruitment pool of foreign jihadists in Afghanistan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, perhaps IS-K’s brightest chances of resurgence are linked to the Taliban’s troubled attempts to bring under control the variety of jihadist groups which they host and that once supported their jihad. To safeguard their relations with neighbouring countries, the Taliban need to restrain these groups, but as much as possible without alienating them. In fact, some have already been alienated. The Yuldash faction of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) had remained loyal to the Taliban after IS-K appeared in 2014 – 2015, but after the Taliban takeover, they were sufficiently upset by the restrictions the Emirate was imposing on them that they started defecting to IS-K. Few of them are now left under the Taliban’s “protection”. The same applies to the Uyghurs of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), who were the first to be relocated away from their long-term hideout of Badakhshan, in the north-east of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there are only hundreds of Uzbeks and Uyghurs in Afghanistan, defections to IS-K can only have a limited impact. The Taliban’s biggest problem is however the Tehrik Taliban Pakistan (TTP), whose military power is not comparable with that of any other foreign jihadist group. While numbers fluctuate due to operations in Pakistan, the TTP has on average some thousands of fighters on Afghan territory and what is worse from the Taliban Emirate’s point of view, it has been recruiting growing numbers of Afghans within its ranks. The Taliban’s Emir and his loyalists are trying to improve relations with Pakistan and have issued a decree banning the participation of Afghans in the TTP’s fight against Pakistan. A previous decree banned foreign jihadists from using Afghanistan as a base for attacks to other countries. Efforts to implement these decrees have been made as the Taliban intelligence has detained TTP members who were returning from raids in Pakistan. In practice, however, the Emirate is not able to restrain the TTP effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pakistans-ttp-the-potential-ally-that-could-turn-the-tide&quot;&gt;Pakistan’s TTP: the potential ally that could turn the tide?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Taliban and TTP sources say that in the meetings between the two the issue of TTP defections to IS-K is constantly discussed. TTP leaders claim that if they were to give up jihad in Pakistan, they would face massive defections to IS-K, implying that they paradoxically agree with the Pakistani authorities that without an Afghan safe haven the jihad would not be sustainable. They even hint subtly at the fact that the TTP leadership itself might have to ally with the Islamic State at that point. Such threats must be made to appear more plausible in the Taliban’s eyes by the fact that, according to both TTP and IS-K sources, the two groups have been cooperating in Pakistan. First, they reportedly agreed on their respective “taxation” rights and recruitment areas in different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and also to exchange logistics. Even inside Afghanistan, areas of TTP control partially overlap with areas of IS-K activity and it is clear that the TTP tolerates IS-K presence there, without supporting the Taliban’s counter-terrorism effort at all. IS-K had from its start a strong presence of former TTP members in its ranks and some TTP factions, chiefly the hardline Jamaat ul-Ahrar, were once closely allied with the TTP. Despite breaking that alliance and re-joining the TTP in 2020, Jamaat ul Ahrar’s leaders and cadres are still often reported by local sources in Kunar (as they repeated multiple times to the author’s research team throughout 2023) to meet the latter’s cadres and leaders, where IS-K has a significant presence on the ground. Furthermore, Jamaat ul-Ahrar approved the February 2023 attack on a mosque in Peshawar, which the TTP condemned and IS-K approved of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emirate never asked the TTP to give up its jihad, but it did ask them not to use Afghanistan as a base for its raids into Pakistan. It tried to mediate between TTP and Islamabad in 2022, however the mediations were unsuccessful. During 2022 and 2023, on several occasions the Taliban have asked the TTP to move its fighting units into Pakistan, according to both Taliban and TTP sources, contacted by the author’s research team on several occasions throughout 2022-23. The TTP tried to comply to some extent and started keeping larger numbers of fighters inside Pakistan. That fell short of what the Taliban’s Amir was asking for and as pressure from Kandahar grew, TTP leaders have at times grown defiant. A case in point is the Chitral raid of September 2023, which the TTP clearly carried out from Afghanistan and even saw a significant participation of Afghan volunteers in the TTP’s ranks. It looked like a provocation of the TTP leadership, tired of being put under pressure by the Taliban to do more to comply with their injunctions. It was after the raid that for the first time the Taliban cracked down on TTP seriously and detained tens of those returning from Chitral. After top level meetings and negotiations, the majority if not all of the detainees, were released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that there are undoubtedly many Taliban members who sympathise with the TTP’s cause. They despise the Pakistani government and believe that the TTP deserves to be supported in its jihad against Islamabad, having contributed many lives to the Taliban’s own jihad inside Afghanistan. These TTP sympathisers are likely the majority of the Taliban in the east and south-east, where the TTP has in the past operated and therefore, solidarity links are stronger. As a result, thoroughly enforcing a ban on TTP activities from Afghan territory would also worsen intra-Taliban relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Taliban, taking this course of action would be very risky, and they know it. However, they are also under very heavy pressure from Pakistan to do something about it. Eventually in November 2023, the Pakistani authorities started expelling hundreds of thousands of illegal Afghan residents, putting the economy of the Emirate under additional strain. The Pakistani armed forces also carried out occasional artillery and air strikes on Afghan territory, as well as targeted assassinations of TTP commanders. As a result of this and of additional pressure that Pakistan might bring to bear in the future, the Emirate might eventually be forced to take measures that the TTP will resist. For example, there is talk of the Emirate seeking Pakistani funding to relocate TTP members and their families to northern Afghanistan, a solution already tested unsuccessfully in 2023 that will certainly not be welcomed by the TTP’s leaders. Other measures that the Taliban might take could instead be at least divisive for the TTP, such as for example the rumoured plan to renew Taliban mediation between TTP and Islamabad. Hardline TTP factions, such as Jamaat ul Ahrar, would strongly object to it. Already, distrust between the Taliban and TTP runs high. Within TTP ranks many who suspect that the targeted assassinations of TTP members are orchestrated by Pakistani intelligence with the help of elements of the Taliban. The prospect of TTP following the path of many former IMU and ETIM jihadists into joining or allying with IS-K cannot therefore be discounted. This is likely to be IS-K’s best chance of raising its head again in eastern Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ultimately, nuclear-armed countries will be cautious in their use of force in any competition, which means that power does not come from the barrel of a gun, no matter how technologically advanced that gun may be, but from the persuasiveness of a nation’s ideas.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition with the West shapes modern China. The story of this competition begins with China’s last great emperor, the Qianlong emperor (who abdicated in 1796), after rejecting commercial ties with an emerging Great Britain, saying Britain had nothing China needed. It was 153 years before China had another leader strong enough to engage confidently with foreign nations. Mao Zedong reforged China into a single, powerful state, but his ideology ultimately impoverished it. When his successor Deng Xiaoping took power, he found a China that was weak and backward. Deng was determined to remedy this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ambivalent relationship with the West is built on a long tradition that dates back to Qianlong and the shock of defeat in the Opium Wars. China began to modernize and “Westernize” its economy in the nineteenth century. So did Japan, but while Japan succeeded, China did not make progress until Deng. Deng’s solution was to open China to the West to stimulate its indigenous technology base and commercial capabilities. This was not yet a competition, but the West — particularly the United States — was and is the yardstick by which China measures its progress, comparing the number of PhDs or patents issued and, above all, the size of national incomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s opening came at a favorable time in U.S. foreign policy. Still recovering from defeat in Southeast Asia, the United States, under President Jimmy Carter and his national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, saw China as a counterbalance to an assertive and powerful Soviet Union. They began to selectively strengthen Chinese military capabilities, selling, among other things, advanced torpedoes, laser-guided artillery shells, and Black Hawk helicopters, while permitting increased commercial ties. The transfer of military technology ended abruptly with the Tiananmen Square massacre, but commercial ties continued to expand and created a giant and deeply interconnected technology base. Some Americans, seeing China’s rise, even hoped China would become a responsible partner that the United States could guide, much as Great Britain had envisioned itself guiding an emerging United States a century earlier. But competition, not partnership, best describes the U.S.-China relationship today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically (since it was ultimately infeasible), Ronald Reagan’s “Star Wars” Strategic Defense Program frightened China into thinking it would fall behind in technology and never catch up unless it made enormous investments in research and used any means to acquire technology from the West. There is an illicit aspect to China’s growth, given its massive espionage campaigns, its use of intellectual property (IP) theft (something that predates the 1949 revolution), and its predatory commercial practices. China does not respect rules for trade and IP protections. Optimistic Westerners hoped this would change as China matured and adopted global norms of commerce, but China felt that espionage and IP theft were justified by the “century of humiliation” inflicted by European imperialism and by the need to grow to ensure this never happened again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are precedents for this competition. The Kitchen Debate between Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev and then vice president Richard Nixon in 1959 was not over who had the best technology or which country made the best toaster; it was over which economic model — markets or Marxism — performed best for citizens. If the debate were held today, the likely winner would be the European Union, whose citizens receive better services than those provided by either the United States or China. But the strategic focus is on economic growth and innovation, not welfare, and the United States and China see themselves engaged in an intense technological contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1960s space race is another precedent. Americans panicked when the tiny Sputnik appeared overhead in 1957. The “Sputnik moment” led to massive U.S. investments in science. The Kennedy administration followed this by setting the goal of reaching the Moon first. The benefits of international influence and the military implications of a lunar landing were clear. The immense spending to get to the Moon, combined with the scientific and technical investments made in response to Sputnik, laid the foundations for the U.S. high-tech economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States had no Sputnik moment with China; in fact, until recently, it had the reverse. In the early 1990s, the United States cut government investments in science and research built up over the Cold War as no longer necessary. For 25 years after the Cold War’s end, the United States coasted, comfortable in its supremacy. It did not regard China as a competitor, even as China embraced competition. China’s rise and the assertive policies of President Xi Jinping have shaken U.S. confidence and ignited competition in many ways centered on technological leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, Xi was premature in proclaiming China’s inevitable rise, as this prompted the United States to reinvest in science and restrict technology transfers to China. China still has one great advantage in the new contest compared to the Soviets. Its deep interconnection with Western economies means it can participate in global markets to sell, buy, and seek financing in ways the Soviets never could. These market connections mean the competition with China is not a replay of the Cold War, where bifurcation between East and West meant there was little exchange of capital or ideas, and Cold War policies, like export controls, will not work as well in this profoundly interconnected environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terms of competition are muddled by analytical shortcomings. There is a tendency among Western analysts to explain complex economic phenomena in terms of a single technology. But a single technology, whether chips or artificial intelligence (AI), does not determine the course of complex and intricately interconnected economies. Just as with the Kitchen Debate or the space race, this is competition between economic models and the political system behind them, not a tech arms race. This competition of models will determine whether China or the United States will be more powerful as a result of the economic growth and technological advances innovation creates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this new competition, the United States has many advantages, but it faces a major obstacle. In China, the Chinese Community Party’s desire for control, Xi’s affirmation of Marxism, and the accompanying recentralization of economic activity will inevitably slow China’s growth and its ability to innovate, as will a growing global reaction to China’s predatory practices. Disarray in Washington does not bode well for U.S. competitiveness, but even a relative U.S. decline does not mean China’s rise. There is more to power than being seen as ahead in technology, and China lacks compelling ideas for global leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But political disarray undercuts U.S. strength. Technology leadership is just one of the global competitions facing the United States: there is one with China, another with emerging, powerful economies that reject the old U.S.-led global order, and one with dogmas on both left and right that undercut the ideas that create the political climate where innovation can flourish. U.S. politics is going through another chapter of the partisan disputes that make Congress dysfunctional, threatening the culture of innovation and science that underpins U.S. strength. American success in a battle of ideas is not guaranteed, and massive defense budgets do not compensate for this. Ultimately, nuclear-armed countries will be cautious in their use of force in any competition, which means that power does not come from the barrel of a gun, no matter how technologically advanced that gun may be, but from the persuasiveness of a nation’s ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A profound shift in trade, technology, and security policy is underway. This has resulted in an increasingly technology-driven economic security policy that has reshaped strategic competition and infused geopolitical risk into commercial considerations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globalization is changing in profound ways. Bilateral trade and investment between the United States and China declined over 15 percent in 2023, down significantly from record highs the previous year. The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, forecasts slowed trade growth in 2024. The U.S. economic outlook is poised for a soft landing, but major partner economies, such as Germany, are now definitionally in recession. Geopolitical currents — once a background rhythm of the globalized economy — have moved to the forefront of trade and economic relationships. The concurrent three Cs — Covid-19 fallout, tensions with China, and mounting climate change pressure — have led countries and companies alike to reassess the resiliency and vulnerability of their supply chains. The proliferation of advanced technology promises further disruptions to trade as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, the United States levied relatively broad export controls on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, signaling a move away from an end user–based system of export controls that had characterized an era of economic détente in the 1990s toward a new era of technology-driven national security. In restraining chip flows to China, the United States moved semiconductors to the forefront of trade policy, securing buy-in from Japan and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is also considering screening outbound investment. In August 2023, the White House published an executive order directing the Department of Treasury to stand up an outbound investment screening system that functions as a notification regime. This regime will provide greater clarity on the volume and nature of U.S. capital and knowledge flows to China in AI, quantum technology, and semiconductors that could be used in military contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concurrent with an expanded national security trade tool kit, the United States and its close partners have sought to build more secure supply chains, particularly throughout the semiconductor sector. Building secure semiconductor supply chains presents considerable challenges. First, export control parity is critical for deeper cooperation since export controls function as a prerequisite to scaling up production. In short, in jurisdictions where the United States believes the risk of technology leakage to China is significant, the United States will not increase investments in sensitive technologies. Second, the United States and its partners must work together to offset some of the costs associated with expanded export controls. For now, the administration maintains the security benefits outweigh the associated economic costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign technology producers such as the Netherlands have signaled a willingness — if not enthusiasm — to engage with the United States on export controls. Peter Wennink, outgoing CEO of Dutch chip champion ASML, has said that additional restrictions on exports to China will not significantly harm the company since it can find alternative buyers and maintain a sizable backlog. However, finding a country with a developed tech sector, a highly skilled workforce, and sufficiently strict trade controls could prove challenging. The U.S.-Japan bilateral efforts to accelerate two-nanometer chip production in a Rapidus-IBM joint effort underscores the alignment of several enabling factors, which include similar export control rules, a highly skilled labor force, and a stable business environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional trade policy would typically assist in offsetting some of these costs by codifying trade facilitation measures and making the exchange of goods and services more efficient. However, the era of traditional trade has been supplanted by an era of “weaponized interdependence” and economic security, and this environment is unlikely to change in the short to medium term. Together with allies, the United States should work to craft rules for this new form of globalized interdependence in which supply chain security will increasingly drive economic policy. New rules must focus on export control and investment screening cooperation but must go a step further in institutionalizing cost offset mechanisms like the U.S.-Japan deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the international level, these new rules could emanate from a new architecture that evolves out of an expanded G7 with a secretariat. An expanded G7 could include Australia and the Republic of Korea. This would grow the economic might of the bloc while identifying opportunities to follow through on building more resilient supply chains. This new architecture could also create clearer guidelines for the rules of engagement at the supply chain and national security nexus, which no other economic institution is currently capable of managing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the domestic level, the United States must ensure the effectiveness of its economic statecraft tools. The United States and its partners continue to move toward an environment dominated by geoeconomics, and economic weapons have reemerged as a prominent feature of the U.S. strategic tool kit. However, unlike the use of kinetic warfare, for which there are clearly established guidelines — a targeting doctrine, a firehose policy, and collateral damage minimization efforts — the U.S. government lacks those tools for economic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A profound shift in trade, technology, and security policy is underway. This has resulted in an increasingly technology-driven economic security policy that has reshaped strategic competition and infused geopolitical risk into commercial considerations. This has manifested in expanded use of trade and investment controls alongside concurrent efforts to retool supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better weather these systems-level changes, the United States and its partners must continue to deepen cooperation on export controls. Yet, controls are insufficient in bolstering security in the long run. As partners pursue industrial policies related to advanced technologies, identifying policy goals at the outset and working toward transparency in implementation will be critical. The United States and its allies have made tremendous progress in advancing a new agenda, and it now falls on partners to follow through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Getting trade policy right has always been complicated. . . . It appears the United States is once again at an inflection point where a growing number of experts are calling for major change.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post–Cold War world order is over, and a new era of geoeconomic and tech competition is underway. Leveraging trade tools to assure the nation’s competitiveness on the global stage will be critical to U.S. foreign policy in the twenty-first century. In tandem with renewed competition, populism is now a defining feature of political landscapes at home and abroad. This shift has yielded efforts to formulate an equitable, worker-centered trade agenda. Policymakers will need to carefully balance today’s new geopolitical reality with domestic pressures to further prosperity and assure security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting trade policy right has always been complicated. Macroeconomically, trade is a win-win situation: it produces more jobs and growth for all parties to an agreement. Microeconomically, however, trade produces winners and losers as some thrive in a more competitive environment and others flounder. The latter blame their problems on imports, and sometimes they are right. Trade creates gains but it does not always distribute them — that depends on tax and education policies, among others. Despite international trading rules against a wide range of unfair practices like dumping and subsidization, some countries cheat, and even when they are caught, relief is often too little, too late. More often, however, the real culprit is technological change and productivity improvement that domestic industry has trouble matching. Sorting out the actual problems and devising a policy of effective solutions has proved difficult and, in the past, led to significant policy debates. It appears the United States is once again at an inflection point where a growing number of experts are calling for major change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, U.S. trade policy since World War II has had two pillars: promote free trade and improved market access and create and maintain rules and structures that support an open rules-based trading system. That policy has produced enormous benefits for U.S. exporters in various sectors. U.S. exports of manufactured goods reached nearly $1.4 trillion in 2019, and exports of services reached nearly $850 billion that year. About 25 percent of U.S. farm products by value are exported each year. However, recently, U.S. trade policy has led to complaints that benefits have accrued primarily to large companies and their executives, not to workers. The complaints have, in turn, led to calls for a “trade policy for workers” or a “trade policy for the middle class.” As with many new ideas, exactly what those terms mean remains to be fleshed out. At this juncture, they appear to mean enforcing existing rules rather than creating new ones, reallocating benefits away from corporations toward workers, bringing manufacturing back to the United States, avoiding market access concessions, and pursuing a variety of inclusivity and sustainability goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing this more idealistic policy faces three challenges. First, it will encounter resistance from trading partners still comfortable with a more traditional approach that focuses on tangible benefits: increasing market access, reducing trade barriers, and refining the rules. Second, world events — notably the Russian invasion of Ukraine and an increasingly aggressive China in the Indo-Pacific — have conflated national security considerations with trade policy. Finally, shortages caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, coupled with security concerns, have refocused policy attention on supply chain resilience rather than on production efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constructing a coherent policy that addresses those challenges has been made more complicated as some developing countries and authoritarian states push alternative narratives that challenge current rules and institutions and exacerbate the divide between developed and developing nations. Reconciling these differences may be impossible in the short term, but if the United States is to maintain its position of global leadership and grow its economy, it needs to try. With 95 percent of the world’s consumers outside U.S. borders, promoting trade is essential for future growth. Trade’s ability to lower costs and increase efficiency is also essential to meeting other global challenges like climate change. The following suggestions may help move policy forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should recognize that while the old Washington Consensus on free market economics is fading, a new consensus has yet to develop, and not all countries are ready for a more idealistic approach. Trade negotiations remain grounded in the search for tangible benefits. Countries are interested in what is in it for them, and the United States is no exception. A successful policy is one that provides opportunities for mutual gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States can make progress on its inclusivity and sustainability goals only if it is prepared to accommodate the goals of other countries, primarily developing ones, which will require rethinking on the part of current stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Companies must recognize that in a more transparent world increasingly sensitive to long-standing inequities, trade policy should include support for worker rights, human rights, environmental sustainability, and other social goals. Governments will require more attention to these issues, and consumers will demand it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trade skeptics must recognize that trade is a two-way street and that accomplishing their goals will require U.S. market access concessions. Moreover, they must acknowledge that trade is as much about exports and economic gains as it is about imports and potential losses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other countries must recognize that increased access to developed country markets in Europe and the United States is not a right but an opportunity that requires reciprocal concessions on their part. There is no free lunch — for them or for us.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best approach is to work within a rules-based framework that imposes discipline on miscreants. The United States has long been a strong supporter of the World Trade Organization and should continue to support the institution, its rules, and its dispute settlement process. At the same time, centrifugal forces in the trading system are making multilateral agreements much more difficult to reach. The United States should not give up on multilateralism but should also pursue plurilateral and bilateral agreements with countries willing to make more ambitious commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While trade accelerates economic change, policy change comes more slowly as nations cling to past practices and resist politically risky innovations. The most successful policy will avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good and will attempt to accommodate other nations’ political and economic imperatives while simultaneously pushing them forward on ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The future competitiveness and security of the United States depends on doubling down on a strategy that supports a strong domestic innovation system that is also internationally connected and resilient.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world runs on semiconductors. They underpin every aspect of modern life, mediating the way people work, consume, and communicate. Banking, transportation, and other public platforms run on computers. And with advances in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, semiconductors will become significantly more pervasive. Leadership in semiconductor technology is, therefore, essential for the United States to maintain its prosperity, competitiveness, and national security. Securing this leadership, in turn, depends on staying on top of three major dynamics — technological, logistical, and geopolitical — driving change in semiconductor technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moore’s law, which in its most general statement anticipates that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years, drives the first dynamic. Firms in the semiconductor and other advanced technology industries expect the speed and capabilities of chips to not only keep increasing but also to do so at an ever-lower cost. With all the advances gained since the late 1960s expected to double over the next two years and then double again two years later, the pace of change is now rapidly accelerating. New computing capabilities will open new technological possibilities, many of which will disrupt existing social, commercial, and political networks. In turn, business leaders, policymakers, and civic entrepreneurs will have to craft new institutions to govern these new shared commons while also allowing innovation to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, as researchers approach the limits of subatomic physics in their quest to cram more transistors into a microchip, the end of the classical definition of Moore’s law might be near. Even so, the growth of capabilities and drop in the cost of semiconductors are expected to continue, driven by innovations in chip design and in the assembly and packaging of semiconductor devices. These innovations will continue to drive economic growth and productivity across the swath of industries that make and use advanced technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to address vulnerabilities in the globally integrated networks of chip research, production, and distribution drives the second dynamic in semiconductor technology. The relatively mild disruption in chip production during the Covid-19 pandemic created multiple downstream ripple effects, halting some auto production, which relies on critical electronic components, and, in turn, affecting inputs to construction and other industries. This was a wake-up call to how critical a secure supply of semiconductors is to the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of further strategic concern is the geographic concentration of chip production in East Asia. Taiwan manufactures some 90 percent of the world’s advanced semiconductor chips. More generally, 75 percent of semiconductor production now takes place in East Asia. Conflict or even a major earthquake in the region could severely disrupt the world’s semiconductor supply, inflicting severe damage to economies across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semiconductor industry is now in the process of rewiring itself to be less susceptible to single points of failure and other weaknesses in the value chain. In support, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act in the United States and comparable policies in Europe and Japan seek to strengthen domestic production and create more resilient global research, production, packaging, and distribution networks. This adaptation is taking place even as demand for semiconductors is expected to soar. The global semiconductor industry, already massive, could grow by 80 percent within a decade to exceed $1 trillion, according to analysis by McKinsey. For the United States to remain a leader in this industry, a substantial and sustained buildup of the physical, research, financial, and skills infrastructure will be required, as well as creative collaborations with both traditional allies and new strategic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is the final dynamic driving change in the semiconductor industry. China was a deeply connected part of the global semiconductor network that grew over the past several decades of relative geopolitical calm. While China has now emerged as a commercial and geopolitical rival, major elements of that integration remain in place, with a significant portion of second- and third-tier suppliers for the semiconductor industry still found in China today. China also remains a major market for semiconductors, accounting for about a third of worldwide final sales. This mutual dependency does not allow for rapid decoupling. Instead, new investments — driven by rising global demand for semiconductors and supported by national policies and alliances — will in time shape the evolution of semiconductor networks that are more resilient to Chinese actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the United States is limited in how it can deny or delay China’s ability to acquire or develop advanced semiconductor technologies. Recent restrictions on advanced chip making equipment have affected some Chinese capabilities. But these actions have also intensified China’s efforts to boost domestic innovation while reducing imports from U.S. firms. Such reductions have cut the revenues of U.S. firms and hence their ability to invest in the next generation of technology. Their Chinese counterparts, by contrast, do not depend on market forces to survive. Indeed, the Chinese national and regional governments are already providing large subsidies to encourage domestic firms to pivot toward innovation and production in higher-node chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convergence of these three dynamics — Moore’s law and beyond, ongoing adaption to improve resiliency, and the new chip war with China — finds the global semiconductor industry on which the world’s economy turns at a perilous moment. The future competitiveness and security of the United States depends on doubling down on a strategy that supports a strong domestic innovation system that is also internationally connected and resilient. In this light, the CHIPS and Science Act must be seen as an initial down payment on a strategic long game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is at the heart of a key challenge for the United States in the energy transition. Faster deployment of renewable energy based on Chinese technology could cede long-term advantages to a key geopolitical competitor.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, how will the actions of the United States and China affect the global energy future? The debate in Washington has been to what extent the two countries should seek to accomplish shared goals through cooperation or competition. Yet an approach that moves beyond cooperation or competition and combines both coherently could help achieve a more secure and cleaner energy future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individually, the two countries have complementary strengths and routes to global influence. After the shale revolution, the United States became an energy powerhouse. The country produces more oil and gas than ever before and has become a significant exporter of crude oil, petroleum products, and liquified natural gas. With bountiful resources, the United States has secure energy supplies and falling domestic emissions, much of it from replacing coal with natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is in another situation. Dependent on liquid fuel imports and highly dependent on domestic coal, China has moved strategically to become a manufacturing powerhouse for critical minerals, solar, wind, batteries, and electric vehicles (EVs). As the world looks toward an energy transition, much of the critical materials and processing capacity will reside in China. Yet the sheer size of China’s economy and its continued reliance on coal has meant that even as it deploys more renewables than its peers and economic growth is slowing, its emissions have continued to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese demand and U.S. supply are two of the key variables in the global oil market. Robust supply outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), especially from the United States, kept oil prices subdued in 2023 despite strong demand growth in China and globally. In 2024, it seems more likely that China’s economic slowdown will dampen its oil consumption. Oil market observers will closely monitor China’s crude imports, its use of domestic inventories, and its refined product exports for signs the country is making more overt efforts to manage the market and leverage its status as the world’s largest importer. In the United States, the two key questions will be whether the shale patch can again outperform expectations and how the Biden administration might manage a run-up in gasoline prices as elections approach. Macroeconomic trends in both countries are essential parts of the oil market story and will continue to be so in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On climate, cooperation between the two countries has waned in recent years. The combined commitment of the United States and China allowed the Paris Agreement to set truly global climate goals in 2015. Last fall, just ahead of the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), the two countries signed the Sunnylands statement to express their mutual commitment to increasing their ambitions for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. The agreement marked a renewal of official climate cooperation, but while a welcome development, this approach can deliver only so much. There are fewer straightforward areas of bilateral cooperation on climate compared to just a few years ago. As a result, much of the recent effort has focused on technical issues, and another political breakthrough seems far off. Moreover, Chinese special envoy for climate change Xie Zhenhua has now retired, and U.S. special presidential envoy John Kerry is headed for retirement as well. The case for cooperation risks retiring with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, competition between the two countries is rising. China has introduced export controls on gallium, germanium, and graphite — minerals important for security and energy technologies. Further restrictions on technology for refining rare earths have been announced. In the United States, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are designed for competing with China as well as for reducing emissions. New subsidies for manufacturing clean energy technology in the United States are leading to significant domestic investment, but Chinese dominance in those supply chains means more political fights over the licensing of Chinese technology by U.S. firms and Chinese foreign direct investment in clean energy. Green protectionism seems ascendant. The United States already levies a 27.5 percent import tariff on Chinese EVs but is considering raising them in 2024 to forestall imports via Mexico. Europe is also responding to the looming market dominance of low-cost EVs from China through an antisubsidy investigation. Further, proposals to raise carbon border charges on Chinese imports, inspired by the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, are gaining popularity on Capitol Hill. China is adamantly opposed to such measures, portending larger trade conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is at the heart of a key challenge for the United States in the energy transition. Faster deployment of renewable energy based on Chinese technology could cede long-term advantages to a key geopolitical competitor. Capturing more investment and prioritizing local content have clearly made climate policy saleable to a broader constituency in the United States but could slow the transition on the margins. Nearly every country planning for the transition faces this same challenge, but the stakes of the U.S.-China relationship make it more severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where a new characteristic of the U.S.-China relationship may emerge. One of the most interesting parts of the Sunnylands statement is the pledge from each country to support five large-scale projects for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) by 2030. The countries share a goal of reducing global emissions. CCUS is a technology that can accomplish this directly by capturing carbon where there is too much of it and storing or using it elsewhere. To deploy it at scale, the United States and China do not need to cooperate or compete, share technology or finance tools, or spurn each other; they simply need to both deploy it. By acting coherently, they can address global problems without overly advantaging one or the other. This will require agreeing on the rules of the game, including discussing and agreeing on global standards in a variety of areas, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, the United States and China are a powerful economic and geopolitical duo. The countries host the world’s two largest economies and are jointly responsible for 43 percent of carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. Their economic trajectories shape global markets, and the world cannot adequately address climate change without both countries finding a path to reduce emissions. The United States and China are also important as leaders in technology, innovation, and global politics. The choices these two countries make about how to invest in energy systems and how much to prioritize reducing emissions set technology trends and reverberate with firms, financiers, and foreign governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wadhwani Center’s Key Takeaways from Developments in AI Last Year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;us-senate-majority-leader-chuck-schumer&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;U.S. senate majority leader Chuck Schumer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;june-21-2023&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;June 21, 2023&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Now, friends, we come together at a moment of revolution, not one of weapons or of political power, but a revolution in science and understanding that will change humanity. It’s been said that what the locomotive and electricity did for human muscle a century and a half ago, artificial intelligence is doing for human knowledge today as we speak. But the effect of AI is far more profound and will certainly occur over a much shorter period of time.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;existential-risk-became-a-mainstream-concern-for-ai-governance&quot;&gt;Existential risk became a mainstream concern for AI governance.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the risk of AI leading to catastrophe or human extinction had been a focus for Elon Musk and many AI researchers in prior years, 2023 saw the issue become a genuine priority among global leaders and government policymakers. The shift was led by calls from high-profile figures in the private sector such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, Tesla and xAI CEO Elon Musk, and AI “godfather” Geoffrey Hinton. In May, a coalition of over 350 leading AI experts and executives signed a one-sentence statement that “mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” This statement immediately led to a rhetorical shift among global policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concern about AI’s malign impact on civilization trickled down to the wider U.S. public. A survey of more than 20,000 Americans by YouGov in April 2023 reported that 46 percent were concerned about AI’s potential to cause human extinction and 69 percent supported a proposed six-month pause on AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar anxieties about the potential catastrophic risk of AI echoed around Washington last year. At a congressional hearing in May, Sam Altman warned that AI could “cause significant harm to the world” and urgently called for greater regulation of the technology. IBM vice president and chief privacy and trust officer Christina Montgomery concurred, “with AI the stakes are simply too high,” and “what we need at this pivotal moment is clear, reasonable policy and sound guardrails.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the UK AI Safety Summit, 29 countries attending agreed to the Bletchley Declaration, which stated that “there is potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional, stemming from the most significant capabilities of these AI models.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-the-netherlands-and-japan-coordinated-export-controls-to-target-chinas-ai-and-semiconductor-technology-development---&quot;&gt;The United States, the Netherlands, and Japan coordinated export controls to target China’s AI and semiconductor technology development . . .&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late January 2023, reports emerged that the United States had reached an agreement with the Netherlands and Japan for the two countries to impose new export controls restricting China’s access to chipmaking tools. Earlier, on October 7, 2022, the United States had imposed strict controls on exports of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) technology to China; however, as Japanese and Dutch companies produced important SME technology, such unilateral action had a limited effect. Details on what was included in these new restrictions were scarce until March 2023, when the two countries formally announced they would be moving forward with export controls on a wide range of semiconductor equipment and technology. Neither country explicitly mentioned China as the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the Netherlands capture 99 percent of the world’s market share of lithography steppers and scanners — crucial for state-of-the-art AI chips. Therefore, this was a major step forward in the U.S. mission to bar China from gaining the lead in the chip race. Still, other countries like Germany and South Korea are also significant producers in the semiconductor value chain, and the United States will need to persuade them both to get on board with controls if they want to continue to slow China’s technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/38ca7oK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kOFaYHh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;---however-their-success-in-slowing-chinas-technological-progress-remains-mixed&quot;&gt;. . . However, their success in slowing China’s technological progress remains mixed.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite international efforts to prevent China from making significant technological advancements, the announcement of Huawei’s new Mate60 smartphone raised concerns throughout the national security community about the efficacy of the export controls. On October 17, 2023, the United States’ Bureau of Industry and Security announced updates to the October 7 controls. These updates included additional parameters for chips’ performance density, the restriction of dozens more items of semiconductor equipment, the expansion of licensing requirements to an additional 22 countries that the United States has an arms embargo with, and the addition of 13 companies to the entity list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ai-chatbots-reached-billions-of-users-worldwide-and-continued-growing-rapidly-in-scale&quot;&gt;AI chatbots reached billions of users worldwide and continued growing rapidly in scale.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT reached over one million users in its first week of launch in November 2022. By November 2023, that number had skyrocketed to more than 100 million monthly active users. OpenAI’s success speaks to a wider public entrancement with AI chatbots around the world. Leading AI development companies launched several new large language models (LLMs) last year, including OpenAI’s updated ChatGPT-4, Meta’s LlaMa 2, and Google’s Gemini. The global demand for this technology has prompted many companies to develop chatbots trained on other languages, such as the Arabic model Jais and the Chinese model Ernie Bot, though the United States still leads in the worldwide development of LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language models are getting bigger, both in terms of the data they are trained on and their parameters (GPT-4, for example, is rumored to have up to one trillion parameters, compared to GPT-3’s 175 billion). In fact, models have grown so large that there are legitimate concerns that companies are reaching the limits of the existing available text training data. However, their growing size comes with growing costs. While training costs are rarely disclosed by companies developing LLMs, OpenAI stated that developing and training GPT-4 cost more than $100 million, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei suggested that future training costs could exceed $1 billion. Growing CO2 emissions and water usage from training and operating chatbots are also attracting increased attention in terms of their effect on the environment. What these upward trends mean for AI chatbots’ profitability and scalability remains to be seen this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;major-economies-around-the-world-took-substantial-steps-to-regulate-ai---&quot;&gt;Major economies around the world took substantial steps to regulate AI . . .&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the transformative potential of AI, the U.S. government began to regulate it through administrative law, acknowledging the imperative to navigate the complexities of AI risks and begin establishing domestic standards. On January 26, 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) unveiled the Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0). Developed in close collaboration with both private and public sectors, the AI RMF serves as a comprehensive tool for organizations engaging with AI technologies and is designed to adapt to the evolving AI landscape. Though the RMF is not intended to be applied as part of formal regulation, many have held the framework up as substantial progress in maturing AI governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announced in June 2023 at CSIS, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s SAFE Innovation Framework marked a strategic effort to confront the profound changes brought about by AI through “comprehensive legislation.” Since September 2023, Capitol Hill has seen over 150 AI experts gather as part of Senator Schumer’s AI Insight Forums. These forums have covered an array of crucial topics, from AI innovation and workforce considerations to national security and guarding against doomsday scenarios. Notably, the ninth forum, held on December 6, 2023, featured a testimony from the Wadhwani Center’s director, Gregory Allen. This forum focused on maximizing AI development to bolster the United States’ military capabilities, aligning with Senator Schumer’s vision for an “all-hands-on-deck” effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the UK AI Safety Summit, the Biden administration announced its Executive Order on Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in late October 2023. The order broadly focused on the development of standards and testing mechanisms for AI safety, infrastructure, and social consequences (such as discrimination and effects on labor). Since the announcement, executive agencies like the Department of Defense (DOD) and State Department have released their policies on AI and detailed how the executive order’s directives will be applied in their respective agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;We face a genuine inflection point in history, one of those moments where the decisions we made in the very near term are going to set the course for the next decades. And with the position we lead the world, the toughest challenges are the greatest opportunities. Look, there’s no greater change that I can think of in my life than AI presents as a potential: exploring the universe, fighting climate change, ending cancer as we know it, and so much more.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The European Union&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 8, the European Union passed its Artificial Intelligence Act, the world’s most substantial set of regulations on AI so far. After two and a half years in the making, the act was finally agreed upon following a lengthy 37-hour negotiation between EU states and the European Parliament. EU commissioner Thierry Breton confirmed the event on X, stating that “the EU becomes the very first continent to set clear rules for the use of AI” in passing the AI Act and calling it a “launch pad for EU start-ups and researchers to lead the global AI race.” Not all EU leaders agree, however; French president Emmanuel Macron condemned the act on December 11, saying “we can decide to regulate much faster and much stronger than our major competitors. But we will regulate things that we will no longer produce or invent. This is never a good idea.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Act regulates all AI sold, used, or deployed within the European Union apart from AI used for military purposes, research, and open-source models, though most provisions only apply to the “high-risk” AI systems. It advances a risk-based approach to managing AI systems by sorting levels of risk into four categories: unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal to none. Unacceptable risks banned under the act include the use of AI for manipulating human behavior, social scoring, and creating biometric databases based on sensitive social categories such as race or religion. The consequences for failing to comply with these rules are steep: under the new rules, companies could be fined €35 million or 7 percent of global revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full implementation of the new AI law is not expected to begin until 2025 at the earliest, allowing time for the European Commission to establish a regulatory oversight “AI office” in Brussels and companies to adapt to the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, China’s generative AI measures went into effect. At the time, these measures were some of the most comprehensive regulations on AI and focused on a regulatory framework for generative AI services to the Chinese public. Earlier in the year, China released a draft that placed significant responsibility onto service providers on topics like ensuring the legality of the data used for training and optimization. Service providers would be met with a fine upwards of 100,000 yuan if they failed to meet these standards. However, the finalized version only requires the service providers to create measures that prioritize desired values within data training and optimization. Shifting from the strict first draft to a more diluted final draft is likely a reflection of industry input as well as sensitivity to the current economic challenges that China is facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures apply to any AI generative technology that provides services that “generate any text, image, audio, video, or other such content to the public.” Services that are not offered to the public are explicitly excluded from the legislation. Additionally, prior to providing services to the public, service providers must apply for a security assessment. In implementation, these have not been difficult to get approved. Chinese military, intelligence, and police services remain broadly exempt from all Chinese AI regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, the Chinese government announced its Global AI Governance Initiative at the third Belt and Road forum. Xi Jinping unveiled the initiative personally, underscoring China’s AI governance ambitions, which include enhancing information exchange and technological cooperation with other countries; developing open, fair, and efficient governing mechanisms; and establishing an international institution within the UN framework to govern AI. The initiative calls for representation and equal rights when developing AI, regardless of a country’s “size, strength, or social system.” The announcement came just weeks after the creation of a BRICS AI study group which aimed to foster closer AI governance ties among the participating nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;---and-to-strengthen-international-cooperation-on-ai-governance&quot;&gt;. . . and to strengthen international cooperation on AI governance.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global efforts to govern AI increased dramatically in 2023. The United Kingdom hosted the first global AI Safety Summit on November 1–2, convening political and technology leaders for discussions focusing on foundation model safety. Attendees included summit host Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, Vice President Kamala Harris, prominent tech CEOs, and, to the surprise of many, China’s vice minister of science and technology, Wu Zhaohui. The most significant achievement of the summit was the Bletchley Declaration, which Sunak called a “landmark achievement that sees the world’s greatest AI powers agree on the urgency behind understanding the risks of AI.” The declaration broadly aims to promote transparency and accountability within companies developing frontier AI models and to develop AI safety evaluation metrics, tools, and research capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI also featured prominently in G7 meetings in 2023, including the Digital and Technology Ministers’ Meeting in April and the G7 summit in May. The group released the G7 leaders’ statement, the Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems, and the Hiroshima Process International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems. The code of conduct was the most consequential of the documents, laying out a set of voluntary guidelines for developing advanced AI systems, such as foundation models and generative AI. It is worth noting that these documents set out voluntary guidelines as opposed to binding international regulations. The G7 countries will also publish the Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several other international assemblies gathered in 2023 to discuss AI for the first time. In February, the Responsible AI in the Military Domain Summit (REAIM) in The Hague, Netherlands, convened ministers to discuss the responsible use of AI for military applications. In July, the United Nations Security Council met to discuss AI risk, at which Secretary-General António Guterres called for the creation of a UN body “to support collective efforts to govern this extraordinary technology.” The urgent need for international cooperation on balancing potential risks and benefits from AI was a common theme across all these governance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What remains to be seen is how international pledges will translate into real-world impact in 2024. Last year brought many voluntary commitments and high-level declarations. This is a start. But perhaps the greater challenge will be seeing how the grittier details of legislation, funding, and international standards unfold within a window of interest that may not last forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-private-sector-emphasized-its-own-role-in-responsible-ai-governance&quot;&gt;The private sector emphasized its own role in responsible AI governance.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the U.S. government made significant steps to begin regulating AI in 2023, the private companies behind AI development have become more, not less, important in pursuing this goal. The government was proactive last year in collaborating with industry leaders to responsibly manage AI. This action has come, in part, from a recognition by Congress that it is playing catch-up to a technology and industry that far predates the government’s regulatory efforts in 2023. The majority of AI research and development exists in the private sector, as it takes extremely large datasets, technical expertise, and financial investment to develop the kinds of frontier AI models Congress is seeking to regulate. It would make sense, therefore, that Congress should seek AI companies’ input on AI legislation as it does with other industry leaders in other sectors. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer opened the first AI Insight Forum on September 13, which gathered senators, CEOs, and civil society leaders to discuss AI regulation, noting that “Congress cannot do it alone.” He added, “We need help of course from developers and experts who build AI systems.” The forums accompanied other congressional hearings that heard from AI CEOs like OpenAI’s Sam Altman and IBM’s Christina Montgomery last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to congressional hearings, AI companies were given a greater responsibility to regulate their technologies in 2023 by Biden’s Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. The order requires AI developers conduct red teaming on their products and report their findings to the government before they are released, placing the onus on companies to do the heavy lifting when it comes to due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the private sector’s growing influence in AI governance is accompanied by growing concerns that there are fundamental conflicts of interest at play. AI companies’ dual role of helping to regulate their innovations as they continue to develop them raises serious questions about whether they can truly place safety over profit. As Marietje Shaake, international policy director at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center, wrote in the Financial Times, “Imagine the chief executive of JPMorgan explaining to Congress that because financial products are too complex for lawmakers to understand, banks should decide for themselves how to prevent money laundering, enable fraud detection and set liquidity to loan ratios. He would be laughed out of the room.” Just as lawmakers are not experts in other industries for which they craft legislation, she and others argue, they must be careful to not be captured by AI CEOs who use technical complexity to advance their own regulatory interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-number-of-ai-related-lawsuits-rose-sharply&quot;&gt;The number of AI-related lawsuits rose sharply.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New AI tools began to test existing legal frameworks in 2023, cutting across domains such as data privacy, copyright, and patent law. So far, the leading cause for lawsuits related to AI is related to data privacy, perhaps unsurprising considering the billions of data points that generative AI models are trained on from across the internet. AI companies have been resistant to revealing their training data thus far, despite long-running calls for greater transparency and concerns about user privacy from academics and civil society groups. A reported hack of ChatGPT in early December highlighted some basis for these concerns: when asked to repeat certain words like “poem” ad infinitum, ChatGPT eventually began to spit out sensitive training data, including phone numbers, names, and addresses. OpenAI has since closed this loophole by restricting ChatGPT from repeating words forever. It also announced in August that website owners can now block the company’s data-scraping web crawler, GPTBot, from accessing their pages and data for training purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has been one of many AI companies to face several lawsuits in 2023 due to alleged privacy and intellectual property violations. One class action lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft made headlines in June 2023 when it claimed that ChatGPT stole millions of sensitive data from hundreds of millions of internet users during training, including from social media accounts, medical records, and personal accounts. Though the complaint was dismissed in court, it was not the only one of its kind; a second lawsuit was filed against the same two companies in September and another, nearly identical, lawsuit was filed against Google parent company Alphabet in July. As of the time of writing, both cases are ongoing, though all three companies have moved to dismiss them in court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of AI for copyright law have also come under greater scrutiny in the last year. In 2023, Getty Images filed lawsuits in the United States and the United Kingdom against generative AI company Stability AI for training its model, Stable Diffusion, on copyrighted data and metadata. OpenAI, Alphabet, and Microsoft faced multiple class action cases from authors whose work, they claim, has been similarly used for training purposes without proper licensing or compensation. Text-to-image AI generators like Midjourney, DreamStudio, and DreamUp were the subject of a similar lawsuit filed in January by visual artists whose work has been used and replicated without permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several companies, such as Meta, Microsoft, and Google, argued they should not have to pay to train AI models on copyrighted work, citing arguments such as AI training “is like the act of reading a book” and curbing access to copyrighted access would chill AI development. These kinds of arguments ask fundamental questions about AI regulation, like whether the unique characteristics of the technology should exempt it from certain laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the U.S. Federal Court Circuit upheld a precedent in patent law when it ruled in August that AI systems are not eligible to own patents for their “inventions” as they are not human beings. The verdict confirmed earlier rulings made by the U.S. Patent Office and the U.S. Copyright Office following years of legal disputes by U.S. computer scientist Stephen Thaler, who first tried to copyright an image produced by his AI system in 2019. Federal Circuit Judge Leonard Stark announced the decision in August saying “there is no ambiguity: the Patent Act requires that inventors must be natural persons; that is, human beings.” The ruling reflects similar decisions made in the United Kingdom and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-department-of-defense-took-steps-to-safely-adopt-and-deploy-ai-in-its-weapons-systems---&quot;&gt;The Department of Defense took steps to safely adopt and deploy AI in its weapons systems . . .&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States was the first country to codify a policy on autonomy in weapon systems when it first adopted DOD Directive 3000.09 in 2012. The policy did not ban the development or use of autonomous weapons — indeed many types of autonomous weapons, such as some missile defense and cyber weapons, had already been in use for decades. What 3000.09 did was place new policy and process requirements for the development and use of autonomous weapons in offensive and kinetic constructs. However, the policy was widely misunderstood as requiring “a human in the loop” and thus banning fully autonomous systems, which it did not do. In January 2023, the DOD published an updated 3000.09 that sought to address the confusion and to account for the rise in machine learning AI systems. Among other things, it formalized that adherence to the Department of Defense (DOD)’s AI Ethical Principles was a requirement at all stages of development and fielding. Reaffirmed by Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, the directive mandates rigorous testing, reviews, and senior-level scrutiny for autonomous systems, aligning with the DOD’s Ethical Principles and the Responsible AI (RAI) Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the international front, the U.S. Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence, and Stability unveiled a ground-breaking “Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy.” This declaration is fully consistent with the ideas underpinning DOD 3000.09 and seeks to make them international, particularly among U.S. allies. Introduced at the Responsible AI in the Military Domain Summit, this initiative has since garnered signatures of support from 49 countries, promoting non-legally-binding guidelines for secure AI deployment in defense contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;---and-to-massively-accelerate-the-dods-adoption-of-ai-enabled-autonomous-systems&quot;&gt;. . . and to massively accelerate the DOD’s adoption of AI-enabled autonomous systems.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 28, 2023, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks announced the Replicator initiative. Replicator aims to “field attritable autonomous systems at scale of multiple thousands, in multiple domains, within the next 18-to-24 months.” The DOD intends for the initiative to counter China’s perceived advantage in military “mass” by rapidly acquiring and fielding large quantities of small, attritable, and relatively cheap drones. Reports suggest that this initiative was informed by analysis of the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replicator will not solely focus on acquiring such systems; it will also build the processes that allow for “replicating the rapid adoption and delivery of technology.” This line of effort will try and build a pipeline that will enable similar efforts in the future. The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) will play a central role in Replicator, both working with Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) end users to establish what capabilities the warfighter needs and exploring which industry partners can provide those capabilities within the relevant time frame. At least for now, the DOD is not requesting any additional funding for Replicator; instead, the initiative will take advantage of “existing funding, existing programming lines, and existing authorities.” DOD officials claim the first Replicator systems will be delivered sometime between February and August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;corporate-interest-in-ai-surged-but-the-magnificent-seven-ai-tech-giants-continued-to-capture-stock-markets-and-global-attention&quot;&gt;Corporate interest in AI surged, but the “Magnificent Seven” AI tech giants continued to capture stock markets and global attention.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI was the magic word of 2023 for firms worldwide. Business intelligence company CB Insights reported that private investment in generative AI reached an all-time high last year with an almost 450 percent increase from $3.2 billion in 2022 to $17.4 billion by Q3 2023. As of March 2023, mentions of AI in executives’ earnings calls — where CEOs discuss corporate performance and strategies with investors and leading analysts — had grown by 77 percent compared to 2022. By September, that figure accelerated to a further 366 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EY’s October CEO Outlook Pulse Survey, which interviews 1,200 CEOs globally every quarter, revealed that nearly all CEOs (99 percent) are conscious of AI’s potential to disrupt current business models and are planning investments into generative AI, either by redirecting capital from other projects (69 percent) or by raising new capital (23 percent). However, the rapid change of the AI ecosystem is a significant barrier to companies’ adoption of the technology: 26 percent stated that the breakneck speed in which AI is developing makes investments risky, while another 66 percent stated that the surrounding hype makes it difficult to ascertain whether other companies have legitimate AI capabilities for partnerships and mergers and acquisitions. To what extent companies effectively adopt AI tools into their business models once the hype settles remains to be seen in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, leading technology companies saw enormous returns in 2023. The “Magnificent Seven” (a term given to Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, and Nvidia) continued to dominate the stock market last year, breaking the record for holding the largest proportion of the S&amp;amp;P 500’s market cap at 29 percent. Goldman Sachs reported that the seven companies’ stocks accounted for 71 percent of total returns in 2023 while all other 493 other stocks made up just 6 percent. While comparably smaller AI companies have still attracted a surge in investment — including 15 new AI unicorns in 2023 as of Q3 — the lion’s share of attention in AI was focused on tech giants in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rapid-technological-progress-showed-no-signs-of-slowing-down&quot;&gt;Rapid technological progress showed no signs of slowing down.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2023 was a groundbreaking year for AI, in terms of both raw model capability and the technology’s capacity to deliver remarkable breakthroughs in an increasing number of scientific fields. The end of the year saw a leap in generative AI capabilities as Google released its new multimodal system, Gemini, in December, possibly foreshadowing a new era for LLMs. “Multi-modal” describes models that can process data from a variety of inputs, such as text, video, image, or audio, and can produce outputs in a similar array of forms. Unlike other LLMs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4, Gemini is natively multimodal, meaning it was trained on diverse inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year also brought significant breakthroughs in AI chip capabilities. Nvidia reached a technological milestone in May 2023 when it unveiled the world’s first 100-terabyte GPU memory system in its new semiconductor model DGX GH200. The new chip is a significant advancement compared to the company’s earlier models, particularly the DGX A100, and it provides over 500 times more memory to the GPU shared memory programming model compared to a single DGX A100 320 GB system. These advanced chips open the potential for faster, more efficient AI models and computing systems — advances to look forward to in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, AI continued to revolutionize an increasingly diverse number of scientific fields. In 2023, AI models from Google DeepMind made significant breakthroughs in both material science, predicting “ingredients and properties of another 2.2 million materials,” and meteorology, with its GraphCast model. Earlier in the year, Huawei published a similar model called Pangu-Weather. These breakthroughs could reveal new materials and methods to construct novel batteries, superconductors, and catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-effectively-can-high-level-global-ai-governance-talks-translate-into-tangible-impact&quot;&gt;How effectively can high-level global AI governance talks translate into tangible impact?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global AI governance talks resulted in significant high-level commitments in 2023, from the Bletchley Declaration signed at the United Kingdom’s AI Safety Summit to the Hiroshima AI Process set in motion under the Japanese G7 presidency last year. How will such commitments translate into actionable policies and enforceable regulations in 2024?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;02&quot;&gt;02&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-will-third-party-red-teaming-work-in-practice&quot;&gt;How will third-party red teaming work in practice?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden’s AI executive order requires that AI developers evaluate their frontier models through a practice called red teaming, in which adversarial attacks are simulated to assess the vulnerabilities and robustness of a model. Developers will be required to report their findings to the government before the model is released to the public. How will third-party red teaming work in practice, and will the government be able to use the findings to keep up with the growing size and capabilities of LLMs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;03&quot;&gt;03&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;can-congress-pass-comprehensive-ai-legislation&quot;&gt;Can Congress pass comprehensive AI legislation?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden’s AI executive order was a step toward U.S. AI regulation, but its efficacy depends upon Congress passing legislation and budget allowances. Will AI regulation remain a largely bipartisan issue, and how quickly can it pass through Congress given the expected tough timing with 2024 elections?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-will-the-italian-g7-presidency-meaningfully-build-upon-the-hiroshima-ai-process-this-year&quot;&gt;How will the Italian G7 presidency meaningfully build upon the Hiroshima AI Process this year?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the Japanese presidency put AI on the G7 agenda and committed to coordinating AI governance efforts under the Hiroshima AI Process. Interoperability between governance frameworks is a daunting yet essential task for avoiding a fragmented global AI landscape, and one that Italy has signaled it will pursue this year. What steps will the Italian presidency take to move the Hiroshima AI Process forward and to deliver the G7’s commitment to harmonized AI regulation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;will-scaling-up-ai-continue-to-deliver-new-capability-breakthroughs&quot;&gt;Will scaling up AI continue to deliver new capability breakthroughs?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The substantial scaling up of LLMs produced dramatic performance improvements in 2023. Will improvements continue to grow exponentially this year, or will developers hit diminishing returns without making fundamental architectural improvements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;will-the-dods-replicator-initiative-get-the-funding-it-needs&quot;&gt;Will the DOD’s Replicator initiative get the funding it needs?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD’s Replicator initiative is a comprehensive effort by the United States to accelerate the delivery of AI-enabled autonomous systems to warfighters at speed and scale. The program aims to address strategic competition with China, a subject of critical importance. What will happen if the DOD receives only token funding?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s late August release of the Mate60 Pro raised serious questions about the enforceability of U.S. and allied export controls and their impact on China’s technological trajectory. Can the United States and its allies effectively enforce export restrictions, and how might this influence China’s technological trajectory in 2024?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-will-ai-impact-major-elections-this-year&quot;&gt;How will AI impact major elections this year?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2024 is the biggest election year in history, with over half of the world’s population heading to the polls. It will be the first year that political parties must define their stance regarding AI, and some voters may see AI regulation featured as a question on their ballots. Both would have been almost unthinkable only a year ago. It will also be the first election cycle in which AI will likely play a significant role in election campaigning, interference, and spreading disinformation. How might the world’s busiest election year fare with AI in the mix?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;will-open-source-ai-models-continue-to-be-available-at-leading-edge-performance&quot;&gt;Will open-source AI models continue to be available at leading-edge performance?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open- versus closed-source debate largely revolves around whether AI development should prioritize transparency, collaboration, and accessibility (open source) or proprietary control, safety, competitive advantage, and intellectual property protection (closed source). Who will emerge victorious in this debate and what implications could this have for AI’s future development, regulation, and democratization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;will-tech-giants-continue-to-dominate-ai-development&quot;&gt;Will tech giants continue to dominate AI development?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI landscape is currently dominated by a handful of key players like Google, OpenAI, and Meta. Will tech giants continue to dominate AI development and market returns in 2024, or will we see a more diversified landscape with winners emerging in niche industries?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A state-of-the-art neural network architecture used in advanced machine learning research. Transformers use a technique called “self-attention” to quickly learn the contextual relationship between data points (e.g., words), allowing it to generate more accurate predictions faster. Initially developed for natural language processing, they are now used for a variety of applications such as computer vision, preventing fraud, or drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;unsupervised-learning&quot;&gt;Unsupervised learning&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A type of machine learning where a model is given training input data without explicit labels. The algorithm explores and finds patterns on its own, and the correctness of the model is often determined by how well it achieves its intended purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these chips are dual-use in that they have military applications as well as civilian ones, most of them end up in the latter category running our computers, automobiles, and, thanks to the internet of things, our refrigerators, toasters, and heating systems. The problem is that we may be about to be buried in imports of these chips from China directly and indirectly. One explanation for that is the U.S. export controls on high end chips and manufacturing technology are pushing China to focus on the low end, but I think it’s more fundamental than that, and it’s a movie we’ve seen before. When the government allocates credit rather than the market, you inevitably get overinvestment, overcapacity, overproduction, and then global dumping, as China exports its excess production and attempts to capture market share and drive foreign competitors out of business. That has happened in steel, aluminum, wind turbines, solar panels, and is about to happen with legacy chips and electric vehicles. Coming down the road are commercial aircraft. Governments, including the United States and European Union, are thinking about what tools they have to deal with this and whether there are new ones they need to put in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the United States has three tools it can use to combat this tactic, and none of them are short. If any action is ultimately taken, it will more likely be in 2025 than this year. The first is to treat this as a traditional dumping and subsidy problem. To prevail, you have to prove that the offense has occurred, and that you have been injured by it. The remedy is a tariff in the amount of dumping or subsidy. While this is the logical approach legally, there are problems with it. Filing a case is expensive, and the investigation usually takes a year or more. A bigger issue for chips, however, is these laws are designed to combat imported items, but many more chips enter the country as part of a different end product — car or computer, for example — than as chips. In such cases, the subsidized import is the car, not just the chips in it. Complaints can still be brought (if a part or component is subsidized, the end product benefited from the subsidy as well) but they must be brought by the affected industry — in this example autos, not chip manufacturers. Since many of the chips in question cost only pennies per unit, the amount of the subsidy will only be a small percentage of the car’s price, making it a less effective remedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which permits the president to take trade actions to protect our national security. Former president Trump used this law to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, which shrouded the provision in controversy. The U.S. has lost World Trade Organization (WTO) cases on its use of the provision and will continue to do so. The process is a bit less than a year, the shortest of the three options, but still long. If substance matters, use of the provision is complicated because it is often hard to agree on what constitutes a national security threat. Many experts disagreed with the steel and aluminum decisions on the merits, and a decision on legacy chips would likely produce the same disagreement. There would also be debate over the negative economic impact if chip imports were banned or had high tariffs attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have the all-purpose trade statute — Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which authorizes presidential action against unfair or unjustifiable acts after a 12-month investigation by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). This provision was largely dormant from 1994 to 2018 because the United States had agreed in the Uruguay Round to only use it in conjunction with a favorable WTO panel decision. Trump ignored that commitment and revived it to justify extensive tariffs on Chinese imports, which the Biden administration has not removed. That use of the provision has also led to unfavorable WTO outcomes. USTR seems to have some affection for this provision, but it has not yet taken any new actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these tools have provided relief to various sectors in the past, there are two problems with them when it comes to chips. First is the problem mentioned above — legacy chips most often enter the country as components of a different product. Tariffs solely on chip imports would have a limited impact, while tariffs or other limits on imports of the many products that contain them would have a significant inflationary impact on the economy. Second, as in the case of steel, our tools are unilateral while the basic problems of over-capacity and over-production are multilateral. Restraining imports into the United States is like squeezing a balloon — the imports simply pop up somewhere else, which means China does not pay a price for its policy. However, producing a multilateral action plan when there are few producers is difficult. Asking a country that does not make chips to impose tariffs on them in the interest of countering Chinese policy will only produce an eye roll. We would be asking them to raise costs to their manufacturers in order to accommodate our companies’ interests. Not likely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: this is a serious problem with long-term consequences for the global economy, but dealing with it effectively will be a lot more difficult than people think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（29日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第18日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他今開始接受辯方盤問。張同意他相信上帝、相信民主、新聞自由和反極權，與黎智英的價值觀一致，惟張不同意黎沒有需要下達編採指示。辯方展示多則WhatsApp 訊息，指黎並不會「下達命令」，而只會向下屬「提出建議」，其指示亦不一定須全盤接受。惟張不同意。他指對於黎下達的指示，「我哋係冇得選擇嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方開始盤問-張劍虹確認相信民主表達自由新聞自由反極權&quot;&gt;辯方開始盤問 張劍虹確認相信民主、表達自由、新聞自由、反極權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方上周五主問完畢，代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻今早開始盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張確認他於1983年畢業於香港中文大學傳理系，除了《蘋果日報》之外，他亦曾工作於《明報》和《經濟日報》，可說是一名資深、富有經驗的傳媒人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問到，從張的宣誓方式來看，張相信上帝，與黎智英有相同宗教信仰。張則說他是基督教徒，而黎是天主教徒。辯方追問，兩種宗教的起源是否一樣。法官李運騰此時打斷，不認為有需要探討下去，之後總結指張和黎均相信上帝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就張所相信的價值觀提問。彭問張是否相信民主，張起初思考了一秒：「唔⋯⋯」，然後回答：「係囉，我相信民主。」在彭提問下，張逐一確認他相信表達自由、新聞自由，以及出版報紙是監察政府的「第四權」。張亦確認他不同意極權，當辯方指他事實上是「反極權」，張思考後回答：「唔⋯⋯都係呀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張不肯定蘋果員工是否認同民主自由-很多人為咗打份工&quot;&gt;張不肯定《蘋果》員工是否認同民主自由 很多人「為咗打份工」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問《蘋果日報》記者和編輯是否均大致上認同上述價值觀。張表示：「呢個我唔敢肯定」，因為《蘋果》的記者和編輯人數眾多，「佢哋（員工）好多嚟係為咗打份工，佢哋知道黎生有咁嘅價值觀，好多時都會配合，但佢哋本人係咪有咁嘅信念，我唔敢肯定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方提問下，張同意陳沛敏、羅偉光和馮偉光均有相同信念，惟張不敢肯定楊清奇的價值觀是否一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹不認為黎智英將決定權交給他&quot;&gt;張劍虹不認為黎智英將決定權交給他&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎智英與張劍虹之間的對話訊息，張提議邀請泛民區議員幫助街坊解決訂閱方面的付費疑難，不過黎並沒有即時同意，「讓他們自發好了，我們發起是否不好意思？」但其後指「你若覺得無問題，go ahead.」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，黎是否放手讓張作決定。張表示：「有咁嘅意思啦，有個positive 嘅反應，因為（如果）佢覺得唔適合，佢會話俾我聽。」辯方追問，黎是否將最終決定權交給張。張則表示，以他多年來對黎的認識，以及他對該訊息的感覺，「佢咁樣寫唔係話將個波拋返俾我，佢其實都覺得OK嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息對話顯示張稱捍衛核心價值絕不妥協-辯方指價值觀一致-黎沒有下達編採指示&quot;&gt;訊息對話顯示張稱捍衛核心價值絕不妥協 辯方指價值觀一致 黎沒有下達編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示陳沛敏傳送給張的訊息，陳當時指前特首梁振英撰文向《蘋果》的廣告商施壓，而當時張回覆陳：「蘋果為捍衛香港言論自由等核心價值絕不妥協」。張確認他所指的「香港核心價值」與「蘋果的核心價值」一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示訊息對話，黎替《蘋果》25週年特刊撰寫感言，並發送初稿至群組，張回覆：「老闆，蘋果是屬於香港人的，昨天是，今天是，明天也是。👍🏻」辯方問張是否清晰地表達同意黎的文章。張則回答：「一係咁講啦，黎生嘅文章我好少表達有咩異議」，又指他上述訊息只是回覆黎，呼應他文章的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指出，黎根本沒有在「飯盒會」中下達編採指示，因為所有人均持相同價值觀，並與黎的價值觀一致。張則不同意，因就算員工有一致價值觀，但不代表黎沒有下達編採指示，並堅稱：「黎係絕對⋯⋯佢係有俾指示。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎的指示不只價值層面-還有催谷人上街示威&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎的指示不只價值層面 還有「催谷人上街示威」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰打斷，指辯方的問題混淆「價值觀」與「編採指示」，但兩者並不相同，例如黎指示英文版要報導中國的負面新聞和不需平衡報導，並不是「價值觀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂改變說法，指出黎智英根本不需要定下報導角度，因為人人都知道如何做。惟張不同意，因黎下達的指示不只是價值層面，例如《逃犯條例》修訂，「黎生嘅指示係催谷人上街、去示威，俾政府壓力，要佢撤銷條例」，而這不純粹是表達自由、民主的問題，而是報紙的方針。張提到，黎會親自參與遊行，「佢秘書和司機亦會夾到時間幾時落車、做訪問，然後《蘋果日報》去報導，而黎生都會吩咐我哋點樣做大，點樣催谷人上街；佢亦都會喺佢專欄《成敗樂一笑》寫稿，呼籲啲人唔好慳嗰幾個鐘，一定要上街，去抗爭，話為咗下一代」。張指，若然黎沒有下達清晰的編採指示，即使《蘋果》員工均一致相信表達自由和法治，他不相信員工「會做出呢啲嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問，如果張不同意黎的指示，他隨時可以拒絕遵從。惟張回答：「唔可以囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示一份《蘋果日報編輯室約章》，當中張代表《蘋果日報》簽署，而林文宗、羅偉光、馮偉光和楊清奇均有簽署，約章提及編輯有自主權。公司年報亦提及表達自由是最重要價值。辯方遂向張指出，員工實可以「向老闆說不」，惟張不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹同意若對政府較批判人士-會購買蘋果日報&quot;&gt;張劍虹同意若對政府較批判人士 會購買《蘋果日報》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，本地報紙而言，若果相比起《蘋果日報》，《明報》較保守和傾向支持政府，張同意。辯方續指，《星島》比《明報》更加保守和支持政府，張回答：「可以咁講。」辯方又指，在光譜上更遠一邊，有《文匯報》和《大公報》，張亦回答：「可以咁講。」張同意報紙有特定立場不是一件錯事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，若果張的立場是支持政府，他會去《文匯報》工作，惟張表示不同意，因一份報紙除了新聞之外，還包含娛樂版、馬經和體育版等，若果他喜歡看《蘋果》的副刊和財經版，不一定會為了政治立場而買《蘋果》。不過張其後亦確認，作為一個資深的傳媒人，若果他想看新聞和評論，會購買與他立場一致的報紙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問，若有人想看多些關於政府的正面消息，他們會購買《文匯報》和《大公報》，張表示：「呢個我唔清楚，不過你咁講我冇反對。」辯方又問張是否同意，對於政府較批判的人士，他們會購買《蘋果》，張思考了數秒，才回答：「都可以咁講嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，一般人只想看他們想看的新聞，而不是為了找出真相，問張是否同意。張回答：「有個傾向係咁，啲人睇《蘋果》，有個觀點係《蘋果》會揭發一啲內幕。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到若有人想看兩種不同立場的新聞，他們是否會購買兩份報紙。張表示不敢肯定，但他其後補充，他起碼知道《蘋果》的立場，「好多讀者知道《蘋果日報》就係黎生嘅報紙，啫係問一個人，諗起《蘋果日報》會諗起咩，佢可能都會話諗起黎生。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張不可以向黎說不-辯方黎會提議多於下命令&quot;&gt;張：不可以向黎說不 辯方：黎會「提議」多於「下命令」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問張是否同意，若然要描述黎智英，他是一個「你唔可以向佢說不」的老闆。張同意。辯方遂展示黎的WhatsApp 訊息，他稱：「劍虹，我有這想法，我們盡量從今後開始每晚都有講座，免費讓升級會員，當做宣傳到十二月用app付費為止。認真做，做好，會有很大word of mouth，是很好谷會員方法。明天公司談。謝謝。」，反映黎並不是以命令的口吻向張說話。惟張則指：「呢個係有禮貌嘅寫法啫」，但是「黎生咁講，就係要我做嘅意思。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則指黎並不會下達命令，而只會向下屬提出建議。張反駁：「但呢個（訊息）對黎生嚟講，已經係一個命令嚟架喇。」辯方指即使黎有下命令，下屬不一定全盤接受。張則稱：「有可能嘅」，但是「大部份都會照做，除非真係做唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示另一段WhatsApp 對話，顯示張劍虹回應黎提議的抽獎計劃，他表示經咨詢律師意見後，有兩種做法，第一種做法是，若果沒有申領牌照的話，便不能以抽獎形式進行，而可以搶答方式，最快答中問題的可獲10萬元現金；第二種做法是，若果堅持要舉辦抽獎，就要申領競賽牌照，但獎品不可以是現金，可改為10萬元信用卡簽賬額。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張確認他曾就抽獎計劃咨詢律師意見，但強調這是跟從黎的吩咐去做可行性研究，而不是辯方所說拒絕黎的建議。辯方指抽獎計劃最後被編輯推倒，惟張表示沒有印象，又指《蘋果》過往舉辦很多抽獎活動，包括「抽樓、抽艇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;高層群組討論應否加蘋果標誌-張最後沒有向黎反映意見&quot;&gt;高層群組討論應否加《蘋果》標誌 張：最後沒有向黎反映意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示「國安法應變委員會」的WhatsApp群組對話，而早前證供提及黎並不是此群組成員之一。就民主黨計劃在七一街站派發的3,000份海報，是否應按照黎的指示加上《蘋果》標誌，一眾編採高層在群組內各抒己見。張確認：「係，因為黎生唔喺度（群組）吖嘛。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，張曾在群組中表示，同事可以逐單表決，若大多數認為不應加上標誌，「我只好跟他說不」，反映張準備向黎說「不」。張回答：「啫係嘗試去講啦」，但對於辯方指黎的指示並非一成不變、不能拒絕，張不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，雖然有幾名同事不認同在民主黨海報上印《蘋果》標誌，但最後他們也沒有向黎反映意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官李運騰提問下，張確認黎當時指示加上《蘋果》標誌，最終是有執行到。張又確認黎對於高層開設「國安法應變委員會」群組並不知情，也不知道他們曾經討論應否加上《蘋果》標誌。張形容：「黎生講嘅指示，我哋係冇得選擇嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（29日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第18日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他今開始接受辯方盤問。辯方指《蘋果日報》一直以來都採取鮮明的政治立場，每年六四維園悼念晚會和七一遊行均會頭版報導，呼籲人上街發聲，並非如張所稱2014年佔中之後才有重大轉變。張則不同意，他指當時作為總編輯感受得到，《蘋果》「不只喺報紙登一頁叫人去上街，爭取普選，而係整整半年一個campaign。」而該「campaign」是「由阿黎生去策動嘅」，包括宣傳6.22公投和錄製《問誰未發聲》。張指：「黎生後來去佔中，佢喺嗰度坐到最後一日，跟住俾警方帶走」，自此《蘋果》有很大轉變，不只是報導六四和七一。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 《問誰未發聲》截圖&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方2014年佔中以前-蘋果已有鮮明政治立場&quot;&gt;辯方：2014年佔中以前 蘋果已有鮮明政治立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方上周五主問完畢，代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻今早開始盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張早前證供提及在2014年佔中運動之前，《蘋果日報》予人印象是「狗仔隊」和娛樂新聞，直至2014年黎智英參與佔中之後，《蘋果》才開始成為反政府的報紙。辯方今指出並不是這一回事，惟張不同意，他堅稱2014年以前，《蘋果日報》的形象較深入民心的是狗仔隊和娛樂新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方反駁指，在2014年之前，《蘋果日報》一直都採取鮮明的政治立場，並展示不同頭版，包括1997年的六四和七一、2004年7月1日的頭版「民主路是走出來的，維園見」、2005年12月4日的頭版「為了下一代的明天，今天上街」，以及2012年7月1日的頭版「捍衛香港人的尊嚴，今日上街」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指上述頭版反映《蘋果日報》一直以來都有鼓勵市民上街發聲，惟張稱：「我唔同意呢個講法囉」，因2014年之前的六四和七一，《蘋果》每年都會「做大」這兩天的新聞，但在其他方面，《蘋果》的公眾形象依然以「狗仔隊」和娛樂新聞為主。辯方則指，2012年12月4日的頭版既不是關於六四，也不是關於七一。張則指那是關於政改。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方接著指出，並不是如張早前所說，2014年是《蘋果》的分水嶺，因《蘋果》一直有呼籲人上街發聲。張不同意，他堅稱2014年是重大轉變，而「我作為總編輯，係感受到嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹堅稱2014年是分水嶺-黎智英策動整整半年宣傳計劃-呼籲爭取普選&quot;&gt;張劍虹堅稱2014年是分水嶺 黎智英策動整整半年宣傳計劃 呼籲爭取普選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又指，2014年時《蘋果》「不只喺報紙登一頁叫人去上街，爭取普選，而係整整半年一個campaign。」法官李運騰追問「campaign」是指什麼。張回答指：「係由阿黎生去策動嘅」，黎最初指示他租大廈外牆登廣告去宣傳6.22公投，後來人大發表《一國兩制白皮書》，黎反對這份白皮書，故打算安排租用貨車去做行為藝術裝置，之後駕駛至全港。張續指，黎亦就一首從《孤星淚》改編的歌曲，指示張利用平台周圍邀請人去唱，歌曲名稱好像是《誰仍未發聲》（註：《問誰未發聲》），而黎有唱一句，其他人亦唱一句，拼湊成一首歌曲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問張是否指原曲《Do you hear the people sing?》，張確認。張續指，後來他沒能力處理租用大廈外牆和貨車，因此黎轉交給Mark Simon處理。他指：「黎生後來去佔中，佢喺嗰度坐到最後一日，跟住俾警方帶走，啫係我覺得《蘋果日報》有好大轉變，唔係以前就咁六四、七一。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎智英有見士氣低落-召開飯盒會冀與員工交流-張劍虹不同意&quot;&gt;辯方：黎智英有見士氣低落 召開「飯盒會」冀與員工交流 張劍虹不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指在2014至2018年之間，黎智英甚少插手《蘋果日報》的運作，因他打算退休。張不同意，又指「佢（黎）退過好多次休架喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黎於2018年回來是因為《蘋果日報》錄得虧損。張表示不清楚黎是否因為虧損而回來，但確認黎「好積極咁返嚟做主席」，惟不同意黎在2014至2018年之間沒有參與《蘋果》運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張不同意黎的參與僅限於商業層面，反指不論在商業、營運和編採上，黎均有參與。張亦不同意辯方所指，黎將編採決定交給編輯判斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張供稱，黎於2018年回來後，知道員工士氣低落，因黎於2017年決定賣出《壹週刊》，最後「賣唔成」，「嗰時啲員工都會諗，會唔會賣完《壹週刊》，就賣《蘋果日報》？」，然而黎當時接受訪問時曾表明不會賣：「一日香港未有普選，佢都唔會賣，佢覺得佢個使命係爭取普選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則指出，黎智英有見員工士氣低落，希望跟中層及基層員工溝通，所以決定開「飯盒會」。惟張不同意，他稱黎在「飯盒會」中解答員工問題和作出指示，不認為黎是基於士氣低落而開「飯盒會」，而且出席會議人士絕大部份都是高層。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方飯盒會與員工意見調查形式相似-張不同意黎會隨時提出想法和指示&quot;&gt;辯方：飯盒會與員工意見調查形式相似 張不同意：黎會隨時提出想法和指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示對話訊息，顯示前動新聞總監張志偉於2018年進行了「動新聞員工意見調查——如何改善動新聞片質素」，並將數項問題交給黎智英，例如影片解像度低，之後黎解答所有問題，向張回覆訊息，並把相同訊息轉發給張劍虹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，每次「飯盒會」舉行之前，與會人士都會將工作上遇到的問題和困難發送至「Slack」群組，以待黎智英在會上解答，由此可見，上述「動新聞員工意見調查」與「飯盒會」形式相類同。惟張不同意，因「飯盒會」開始之前半小時，大家會吃飯盒，而同時「黎生會講自己嘅嘢」，例如他對時局的看法，然後才會解答各人在會前提出的問題，但期間黎隨時會提出一些想法和指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，員工提出的問題包括飯堂的食物質素，惟張指這類問題「好罕有」，他亦不同意「飯盒會」很少觸及編採事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎並非話哂事-冀聆聽中層員工聲音&quot;&gt;辯方：黎並非「話哂事」 冀聆聽中層員工聲音&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示WhatsApp 訊息，可見張劍虹向黎智英提議：「老闆，每週VIP房的飯盒會，可以訂在每個週四或週五。人數十二人，主要中基層員工，這樣可以嗎？」黎則回覆：「十二人是否太多，連我和你和Dom，最好不超過八個最能溝通。高中層都有更好。」後來黎再送訊息：「如果你認為八個人太少，不如增至十個吧。謝謝」，張回覆：「老闆，收到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指上述訊息反映黎並非「話哂事」（not dictating everything），惟張稱：「呢個唔同意」，反指黎的意思是指示人數增至10個，所以他之後表示「收到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示另一段訊息，張提議：「我們不如每月另外加來一個中層員工飯盒會，不同部門中層員工一起吃」，但黎回覆：「一起吃可能有些人有其他部門人在不會講真心話，但每個部門一月一次又會太多會。讓我們再想想。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指上述訊息再次顯示黎並非打算在「飯盒會」裡「話哂事」，而是聆聽員工們所提出的問題。張不同意，因中層會議的源起是資訊科技部有一群中層員工集體辭職，所以黎想與中層員工開會，惟在他記憶中，這些中層員工「飯盒會」沒有再開過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方飯盒會關於業務發展-不只關乎新聞部-張不同意&quot;&gt;辯方：飯盒會關於業務發展 不只關乎新聞部 張不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在大量的WhatsApp訊息之中，不見任何紀錄顯示黎在「飯盒會」中獨行獨斷，例如明言「我要這個編採政策」。不過張不同意，因為「飯盒會」是在軟件「Slack」群組中舉行，而不是在WhatsApp 舉行。而黎吩咐張記下會議重點，然後把point form的會議紀錄上載至「Slack」群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示張劍虹於2020年1月13日發送給陳沛敏的會議紀錄截圖，指會議中有關政治的事項只佔少部份。張則指這正好顯示黎有作過編採決定，例如黎認為一些年輕人因參與抗爭而與家人關係轉差、好慘，便指示同事訪問他們。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，「飯盒會」並不只關乎新聞部，張同意，因不同部門輪流與黎開「飯盒會」。辯方續指，大部份「飯盒會」均與新聞部無關，張就：「都可以咁講，大部份唔一定係《蘋果》紙（報紙）同網（網站）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，即是說黎與銷售部開的「飯盒會」，是不會討論編採政策？張則指黎依然會評論時局，「佢諗到就會講」，但在銷售部會議中比較少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問，那《飲食男女》部門的「飯盒會」有否談及編採指示？張指「可能會有架，黎生都有叫佢哋訪問黃店、小店。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂指出，「飯盒會」其實只是關於業務發展的會議，因此前壹傳媒營運總監兼財務總裁周達權和資訊科技部主管Connie Chan也需出席。張表示不同意，並指「會議可能有談及業務發展，但不是主要議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;對談節目邀美國退休軍官 張劍虹一度表憂慮 黎智英回應「我一定去到盡」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/K26hXlb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（26日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第17日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。就直播節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，張稱得悉會邀請前美軍副參謀長 Jack Keane 任嘉賓後，擔心被指勾結外國勢力，遂向黎表示：「呢啲時候請呢啲退休軍官，會唔會好敏感？」張憶述當時黎回應：「佢哋（中共）咁搞我，我一定去到盡㗎，我冇得褪㗎。」另外，張形容黎希望特朗普可以連任美國總統，又相信他即將出手實施制裁，因此吩咐員工報導選舉辯論時不要寫太多攻擊特朗普的言論。控方表示主問完畢，辯方申請押後至下周一（29日）才開始盤問證人，獲法官批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹確認直播節目邀請多名外國嘉賓-曾表達憂敏感-黎回應去到盡我冇得縮&quot;&gt;張劍虹確認直播節目邀請多名外國嘉賓 曾表達憂敏感 黎回應「去到盡」、「我冇得縮」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方在庭上展示WhatsApp群組「English news」的訊息，顯示前動新聞平台總監張志偉每周均會發送訊息至群組，通知黎及其他高層有關「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目時間及嘉賓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹確認，曾出席節目的嘉賓包括：前美軍前副參謀長 Jack Keane、美國前副國防部長 Paul Wolfowitz、前港督彭定康、以色列前副總理 Natan Sharansky、美國在台協會前主席 Raymond Burghardt、「香港監察」創辦人 Benedict Rogers，以及壹傳媒獨立非執行董事、《南華早報》前總編輯 Mark Clifford。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及 Jack Keane 是誰，張指是美國的退休軍官。被問及如何得知 Jack Keane 的身份，張憶述黎在一次對話中曾提及：「最近啲嘉賓都好猛」，並指 Jack Keane 是退休軍官，很有影響力。張聞言後表達憂慮：「呢啲時候請呢啲退休軍官，會唔會好敏感？」張記得當時黎回應：「以我做咗生意幾十年，以我做生意嘅直覺，佢哋（中共）咁搞我，我一定去到盡㗎，我冇得褪㗎。」張憶述：「我聽到黎生咁講之後就冇表達意見喇，我就同黎生傾其他事項。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎稱「去到盡」是什麼意思。張指黎當時未有解釋「去到盡」的意思，「但佢就話『我冇得縮㗎』」，以張多年來對黎的認識，他理解「去到盡」的意思是「請呢啲咁勁嘅嘉賓，講要講嘅嘢」，並請求外國提供保護。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問張，當時向黎表達意見時有什麼憂慮。張指黎早前被拘捕，獲得警方擔保，當時即將要續保，所以當黎在會議室提起節目嘉賓時，張才會說出上述說話：「啫係呢啲時候請啲退休軍官會唔會太敏感呢？」控方追問「敏感」的意思，張說：「啫係勾結外國勢力囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎智英live-chat節目在fb累計有57000人次觀看&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎智英Live Chat節目在FB累計有57,000人次觀看&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有訊息提到「果燃台」，張劍虹解釋它是《蘋果》網站入面的一個影片平台，主要播放遊行直播、黎的 Live Chat 直播和對談節目。至於軟件程式 ZOOM，張則指黎一直提議使用 ZOOM 來做直播，當黎開啟 ZOOM 的聊天室功能，讀者便可以加入參與聊天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中張志偉於2020年8月30日的訊息指，黎 Live Chat 節目的 Facebook 直播最高峰有2,000多人同步觀看，當時累計已有57,000人次觀看過；而 Twitter 直播則最高峰約有近1,000人同步觀看，累計有12,000人次看過，並指上述數字是節目以來最高紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英相信特朗普快將出手制裁-指示同事不要針對特朗普&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英相信特朗普快將出手制裁 指示同事不要針對特朗普&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上再展示黎智英於2020年6月2日發送給張劍虹的訊息：「裕鑫，請國際組同事不要跟紐約時報及CNN針對川普，我們蘋果卻要靠川普政府支持保命，這樣做不太好。謝謝。黎」，張回覆「老闆，收到。我上週也請香港國際同事留意。謝謝」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張解釋，當時《蘋果》發起「一人一信救香港」，黎亦很密集地接受外媒採訪，「佢嗰時覺得 Trump 會好快做嘢，同埋會 take 啲好大嘅制裁行動。嗰時 Trump 講過中國行《國安法》會有好嚴重後果，咁上下嘅嘢，所以黎生嗰時好期望 Trump 好快出手」，於是指示員工不要揀選太多針對特朗普的譯文，包括 CNN 和《紐約時報》。張又指「靠川普政府支持保命」中的「支持」意指政治支持。張表示，他收到黎的指示後，便轉達給前總編輯羅偉光、前副社長陳沛敏和國際組同事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又補充，後來約2020年9月進入美國總統大選期，兩名候選人特朗普和拜登出席公開辯論，「咁國際版嘅同事有時會兩邊意見都表達出嚟，但黎生都吩咐攻擊 Trump 嘅說話都唔好寫咁多」，而且「黎生都好希望 Trump 可以連任嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹李怡寫反共逆權和攬炒-是黎心儀的專欄作者&quot;&gt;張劍虹：李怡寫反共、逆權和攬炒 是黎心儀的專欄作者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示已故專欄作家李怡傳送給張劍虹的訊息：「劍虹兄：年紀老邁，最近感精力不繼，打算自下月起，每週減寫兩篇世道人生，即星期一三五刊出，繼續寫時評。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問「世道人生」是指什麼，張劍虹指，李怡於2000年代起擔任《蘋果》的專欄作家，刊於論壇版「世道人生」，乃由黎智英親自邀請。當時李怡逢星期一至五，每天均會發布專欄文章，惟他指自己年紀大，所以提出減少撰寫文章數目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，李以前是月刊《七十年代》的總編輯，亦是一名對共產黨很熟悉的作家，主要寫政治文章，內容提及反共、逆權和「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，「佢（李怡）一路都係老闆（黎智英）好心儀嘅作者，佢喺《蘋果》寫咗不下十幾二十年，一路都係符合老闆黎先生嘅方向。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂向張展示兩篇由李怡撰寫的專欄文章，包括《攬炒的最佳時機》（刊於2020年6月24日）和《夜行人吹口哨》（刊於2020年8月10日）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹員工擔心國安法影響-高層設立國安法應變委員會群組&quot;&gt;張劍虹：員工擔心國安法影響 高層設立「國安法應變委員會」群組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，《蘋果》員工關注《國安法》對於公司的影響、擔心「紅線放喺邊」，有的更考慮辭職，有見及此，高層設立了 WhatsApp 群組「國安法應變委員會」，不過黎並非該群組成員之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月2日，即《國安法》生效之後，前執行總編輯林文宗向群組發出訊息：「Signal有口訊自焚功能，不留紀錄。我建議呢個谷可轉去Signal」，張之後回覆「好！我唔識，不如阿敏重開一個」。張確認後來他們轉至另一個通訊軟件 Signal 創立一個新群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張解釋，當時有傳《國安法》實施之後，連 WhatsApp 通訊都變得不安全，若果高層想討論一些「敏感啲嘅話題，例如文章係咪建議去做、紅線呢啲」，希望通訊可以較保密。控方追問「敏感話題」和「紅線」是什麼意思，張則舉例指，民主黨打算於7月1日街站派發有關抗爭的海報，黎智英希望該海報能加上《蘋果日報》的標誌，當時眾人曾經討論是否應該如此做，擔心予人感覺《蘋果》與政黨關係太過密切，最終該海報亦有加上《蘋果》標誌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張憶述，他於2020年7月初加入新的 Signal 群組，討論話題亦包括廣告事宜，後來黎智英還柙，有同事去探訪他，「黎生有啲說話，大家都會喺度分享啦。」控方問上述話題與 Signal 的訊息自焚功能有何關係，惟張表示：「我記唔起有啲好⋯⋯覺得有必要銷毀嘅訊息。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹161篇涉案文章均是按黎智英指示立場和方針來發表&quot;&gt;張劍虹：161篇涉案文章均是按黎智英指示、立場和方針來發表&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹在本周一曾到庭閉門閱讀161篇涉案文章，他確認該些文章在2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日發布，內容鼓吹抗爭和請求外國制裁。張續指：「呢啲文章全部係按黎生的編採指示、立場、方針嚟發表嘅。而我作為社長，同其他管理層都係按住職能，跟住黎生嘅編採指示嚟發表文章嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張補充，陳沛敏和林文宗專責實體報紙；羅偉光負責網上新聞；馮偉光負責整個英文版的運作；楊清奇則統籌論壇版，亦會撰寫社評；而張自己作社長，「係要確保黎生嘅編採政策和方針，係準確地執行到出嚟啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示沒有其他問題，主問完成。代表黎的資深大律師彭耀鴻申請押後至下周一（29日）才開始盤問證人，以讓辯方法律團隊整理過去數天證供，使盤問能更有組織和集中。法官杜麗冰認同這是恰當做法，遂押後至下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告黎智英（76歲）否認一項「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」及兩項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英的律師團隊包括資深大律師彭耀鴻和大律師 Marc Corlett、關文渭、黃雅斌、董皓哲及李峰琦。3間蘋果日報公司清盤人由大律師王國豪代表。&lt;/p&gt;

Thus far, less attention has been given to societal readiness for war, but there are signs that this imbalance is starting to be addressed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea was an insufficient wake-up call for NATO. The Eastern European members got it, but others largely dismissed Moscow’s aggression, just like in Georgia in 2008. The follow-on large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was too severe to ignore, and sparked NATO’s warfighting transformation. Its 2022 Strategic Concept finally called Russia a threat, not a partner, and committed to defending “every inch of NATO territory”. It has hardened its military posture, doubling its multinational battlegroups from four to eight, stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European militaries were also exposed as having been “hollowed out” – the UK had no more than a week’s worth of artillery ammunition to keep it in the fight, the German Bundeswehr just two days. Therefore, the last two years of planning has focused on the military, and not society, component of warfare. Now, however, there are signs of a coordinated effort across the Alliance to engage civil society more broadly and prepare it for war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-call-to-arms&quot;&gt;A Call to Arms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, the UK Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Patrick Sanders, warned that the UK public would need to be called up to fight if war with Russia was declared, calling for the government to “mobilise the nation”. The General, who steps down in six months, is on the record as strongly opposing troop cuts to the Army to just 72,500 by 2025, and thus his warning could be easily dismissed as a parting shot. Moreover, while comments about conscription have been picked up by the press, his warnings are more nuanced and go beyond the service that he currently commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real issue is not about conscription, nor is it necessarily about getting more civilians in military uniforms. It is about having an honest discussion with the public on the likely significant impacts that a war would have on the UK’s way of life, its functioning as a civil society and its national institutions, such as the NHS. Some of the UK’s closest allies do this as standard under a total defence model. And while the UK has its own approach to comprehensive security – through the “Fusion Doctrine” – to foster a whole of society approach, General Sanders’ comments could be seen as trying to start a broader debate across UK society, and he is not alone in calling for one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Swedish Civil Defence Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin acknowledged to a defence conference that “there could be war in Sweden”. The Swedish Commander-in-Chief, General Micael Bydén, went further, declaring that all Swedes needed to “prepare for war”. While these comments received some criticism for being alarmist, Sweden operates a total defence model, and the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency has for many years published a brochure for its citizens titled “If Crisis or War comes”. Last week, Admiral Rob Bauer, Chair of the NATO Military Committee and the Alliance’s most senior military officer, warned that NATO could be at war with Russia within 20 years, which would require many civilians having to be mobilised to fight. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius assessed that his country needed between five to eight years to be ready for war, and a leaked German military planning scenario worked on the assumption of hostilities opening with Russia as early as 2025. Recently, German policymakers have openly discussed the return of conscription, which was active from 1956 until 2011, or the introduction of some form of “civic service”. A similar debate has been opened in Sweden. Elsewhere, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas put the timeframe for a potential war with Russia at “three to five years”. Both the Norwegian Chief of Defence and Polish intelligence say three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no collective assessment of the exact timeframe, and obviously the frontline NATO members – who want more support – are likely to publicly assess a tighter deadline for readiness. However, it is striking that two years on from Russia’s invasion, in the space of a month, senior NATO politicians and commanders have started to be more honest with their electorates about the threat and its impacts, suggesting a coordinated effort to prepare society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-has-changed&quot;&gt;What Has Changed?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing obvious in open sources to suggest that the threat posed by Russia has significantly changed such as to warrant this flurry of announcements. The Russian military continues to be fully committed to combat operations in Ukraine. However, there are some potential explanations for this messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sober analysis from Ukraine continues to provide planning assumptions for NATO of what a potential future war with Russia might look like and the human capital required&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, and most simply, this could be a case of a hierarchy of needs, with NATO needing to fix its military readiness first before increasing resilience and readiness in the rest of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, almost all NATO militaries, including the US, the UK and Poland, are suffering from recruitment and retention challenges. The projections for the future look bleak unless current trends are corrected. All the additional capabilities that Europeans have purchased in the last two years will not become operational unless the right number of skilled personnel exist to use them. It is a critical vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, NATO is currently adopting its “New Force Model” – its largest military adaption since the end of the Cold War – which has the ambition of a significantly higher number of forces available at higher levels of readiness. Moreover, its new regional defence plans and transatlantic reinforcement plans must be delivered on. In getting to the detail of the “executability” of these plans, it is possible that the Allied Chiefs of Defence are concerned that they might not be enough, or that the requirement for follow-on forces will be greater – especially if there are questions about the viability of the transatlantic reinforcement plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, and linked to the preceding point, sober analysis from Ukraine continues to provide planning assumptions for NATO of what a potential future war with Russia might look like – which would be on a scale never previously experienced by the Alliance – and the human capital required. The situation is extremely challenging, and Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, has requested that President Volodymyr Zelensky order the further mobilisation of 500,000 troops to support defensive operations this year and to prepare for subsequent military offensives in 2025 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, now that 2024 is finally here, Europeans are becoming far more concerned by the spectre of a second Trump presidency in the US. After commanding wins in both the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire Republican primary, he is almost certainly going to be the Republican nominee in November 2024. With his history of anti-NATO and pro-Putin comments, Europeans might finally be starting to realise that they need to do more to make up for any potential US shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-timing-is-right&quot;&gt;The Timing is Right&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the drivers for these warnings, the timing and motive is right for several reasons. First, NATO societies have direct and recent experience of civil-military integration (CIMIC) from providing military support to civil authorities during the Covid-19 pandemic. This valuable experience of civic service must be harnessed and adapted to the current situation. An expansion of civic service would have many resilience benefits, but specifically, it would reduce pressure on the military to act as a ’fourth emergency service’, which significantly impacts military readiness for warfighting. Second, the war in Ukraine and the recent Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have directly impacted societies – increasing energy costs and causing supply chain disruption, leading to higher prices and increasing the cost-of-living – providing a more captive audience and greater public interest in international security. Third, Finland, long considered an exemplar of comprehensive security, has now joined NATO, soon to be followed by Sweden, providing deep knowledge and expertise which can and should be leveraged by the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yes, a public debate on conscription would be politically sensitive, but it is clear that the current approach is not working and that it is a critical national security risk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, total defence models are not all created equal, and there is a variation between national approaches, reflecting history, geography, and political sensitivities. Resilience is first and foremost a national competency under NATO’s Article 3, and it should be strengthened from the ground up. The Finnish model of comprehensive security is founded on a deep history of societal resilience, developed during the Second World War and the Cold War. A high proportion of society contributes and says that it would be “prepared to participate” in defence activities. The model is founded on an educational programme, which starts at school and includes national resilience and National Defence Courses that provide a total overview of Finland’s foreign, security and defence policy, with the aim of improving cooperation between different sectors of society. While the approach of one Ally cannot simply be exported to another, adaptions should be made to start this journey, and the recent senior NATO interventions should be considered as a direction to national governments to get moving. This will take time – the Finnish system has taken 80 years to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-social-contract&quot;&gt;A New Social Contract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the UK Defence Secretary argued that the world was becoming a more dangerous place. Indeed, the contemporary and future security challenges facing the UK will need a whole-of-society approach. However, the societal dimension cannot be transformed as easily, or as quickly, as the military component. An incremental approach is the best and most politically acceptable route. Therefore, the recent collective NATO announcements should not be seen as an overreaction, but rather as an attempt to start to set the conditions in NATO societies for further developing individual and collective systems, learning from each other, to be better prepared for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important that this should also include a new social contract which is explicit and transparent about national security risks and the costs of both action and inaction. Moreover, it must be non-party political. Indeed, support for Ukraine and the recent UK strikes against Houthi positions in Yemen have fostered unprecedented levels of support from the opposition Labour Party at the operational level, although disagreements are still evident on policy. This may or may not involve a discussion on the pros and cons of conscription or another model of mobilisation, but it is an opportunity to start to publicly articulate why this could be necessary in the future and how it might develop. Yes, a public debate on conscription would be politically sensitive, but it is clear that the current approach is not working and that it is a critical national security risk, with the Army not meeting its recruitment targets for 14 years. Developing a new social contract will take time and a government willing to legislate in the face of public apathy or even antipathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it is an acknowledgement that defence spending will have to increase to keep the country and its people safe, as the only realistic mitigation measure against a more dangerous world. If this all sounds politically unappealing – or too costly, to NATO capitals – there is an easier and much cheaper solution: giving Ukraine what it needs to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（25日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第16日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。張表示，黎智英拒絕接納馮偉光建議在英文版加副刊文章，因英文版目的是引起外國關注及輿論，「如果加埋呢啲 feature（專題）落去，就會 dilute（淡化）咗成樣嘢。」張又指黎曾表示《國安法》實施後「香港同《蘋果日報》都係生死存亡之秋」，亦曾稱很多外國傳媒排隊訪問他，但強調「佢話佢唔怕嘅，佢會照講，講佢要講嘅嘢，包括要求美國制裁中國」。另外，張表示黎於2019年底指示推行「撐小店」計劃，讓他們免費在《蘋果》登廣告，並指「黃色經濟圈」對抗爭運動有好處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張稱黎拒在英文版加副刊文章會淡化引外國輿論的作用&quot;&gt;張稱黎拒在英文版加副刊文章：會淡化引外國輿論的作用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹作供時解釋《蘋果日報》網上英文版內容。他確認英文版不會出現關於中國的正面新聞，只會有負面新聞。張又解釋英文版的不同範疇，專題方面包括逆權報道、以及新疆集中營的調查報道。至於專欄方面，則包括不同社論，例如黎智英的「成敗樂一笑」、李怡及顏純鈎的專欄，同時亦會有英文作者所撰的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張表示，他及黎智英曾經建議一些英文寫手，最後由黎負責核准。黎亦表示，Mark Simon 及 Mark Clifford 會找人寫英文版專欄。不少由張等介紹的寫手曾寫過專欄，但同時亦有一些非他們介紹的寫手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張提到，英文版並沒有副刊內容如飲食及旅遊等。於2020年9月、《國安法》實施後，執行總編輯馮偉光曾向張表示，英文版內容種類太少，大多是「逆權、抗爭、制裁」這類型的文章。馮遂問「係咪可以加啲副刊類型嘅文章落去？」，即包括旅遊、飲食、文化等軟新聞（soft news）。張就此事向黎智英索取指示，但黎回應「唔好咁做」，並強調英文版目的是「希望用我哋揀選嘅一啲偏黃、支持《蘋果》嘅新聞，引起外國關注同輿論」，又指：「如果加埋呢啲 feature（專題）落去，就會 dilute（淡化）咗成樣嘢。」張把黎的訊息轉達馮。因此，英文版專題主要關於「香港逆權、中國打壓人權」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，似乎所有的編採決定並非由張劍虹作出，而是需要向黎智英索取指示。張同意，並指因涉及英文版方向性的編採決定。李追問，一般報社也並非由社長作出編採決定？張解釋，以其理解各傳媒報刊都會有其編採政策，「好多時 owner（擁有人）有個人 style（風格）、有個人立場」；除非對方「好放手」，或者其股權透過基金持有，他完全不處理業務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱英文版新聞太少難吸引讀者-馮如美國制裁林鄭會即時加新聞&quot;&gt;黎稱英文版新聞太少難吸引讀者 馮：如美國制裁林鄭會即時加新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示英文版 WhatsApp 群組對話，黎智英於2020年8月8日、《國安法》實施後向張及馮發訊息，表示「劍虹，盧峯，我們新聞數目太少，沒有 critical mass（群聚效應）吸引讀者，應想想辦法增加。或可增加一些財經新聞？但時事新聞肯（定）要增加。謝謝。黎」。馮回應「明白，正逐步增加，有重大新聞如美國制裁林鄭會即時增加幾條」。而張則回應「老闆，明白。正在增加中，會加快速度。謝謝」。控方問及，為何需要在英文版中增加制裁的新聞，張解釋黎智英指示需要集中制裁、逆權及抗爭的新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱英文版需要集中於中國新聞&quot;&gt;黎稱英文版需要集中於中國新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示群組的其他訊息，黎智英於2020年8月26日向馮傳訊息，他轉發了一則新聞連結，題為〈共和黨稱拜登對伊朗及伊斯蘭國有好處，對中國而言很好〉（“Republicans say Biden ‘Good for Iran and ISIS. Great for China’”）。黎同時問，「盧峯，我們需要這類型與中國無關，但所有英國主流報章都有刊登的新聞嗎？我在考慮。（“Lo Fung, Do we need this kind of news that has nothing to do with China and all major English newspapers have published it? I wondered.”）」馮回應：「我嘗試包含一些國際新聞，因我們的讀者來自世界各地，他們或想知道多些全球主流新聞，尤其美國選舉等重要新聞。（“I am trying to include a few stories on international news, as our readers are from all parts of the world and they may want to know a bit about major news happening around the globe, especially important news like US election.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馮再回應：「作為成熟的新聞頻道，我認為我們需要覆蓋對讀者而言重要的新聞。提供更多種類內容。（“As a full fledge News channel, I think we need to have some coverage on news that’s important to readers. Give some more variety of content too.”）」黎卻表示：「我不認為需要這類型的新聞，因他們的本地新聞會覆蓋。我認為我們需要集中於中國新聞，並以此聞名，不要令其淡化。（“I don’t think this kind of news is needed since wherever they come their local news media should have covered it. I rather think that we should focus on Chinese news and be known for it without dilution.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馮其後表示「好的，會由今日起停止國際新聞（“Ok, will stop running international news from today”）」。張亦表示「收到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎認為國安法後香港及蘋果都處生死存亡之秋&quot;&gt;張指黎認為《國安法》後香港及蘋果都處「生死存亡之秋」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，是否自2020年8月26日起，英文版沒有再覆蓋國際新聞，只是集中於中國新聞？張表示「相信係」，並指「黎生講到明唔可以有呢樣嘢（國際新聞），應該唔會再出，黎生睇英文版新聞睇得好緊㗎」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎「睇得好緊」的原因，張指黎心急想盡快推出英文版，是因成立《國安法》的時候，他冀影響到國際輿論，「希望外國可以關注香港情況做一啲嘢」，且「希望香港同《蘋果日報》都可以得到美國同其他西方國家嘅政治保護」。張又指：「何況《國安法》已經實施咗，黎生覺得香港同《蘋果日報》都係生死存亡之秋」，因此黎對英文版很著緊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方反對控方問黎智英想法-因張並非其肚子內的蟲&quot;&gt;辯方反對控方問黎智英想法 因張並非其「肚子內的蟲」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方資深大律師彭耀鴻就控方問題作出反對，因控方問及黎的想法，但張「並非黎智英肚子內的蟲（“not a worm in Mr Lai’s stomach”）」。法官杜麗冰認為，張相對熟悉黎，因此能夠作出判斷，並指可於盤問時再澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張黎稱受訪時會照說要求制裁佢話佢唔怕嘅講要講嘅嘢&quot;&gt;張：黎稱受訪時會照說要求制裁、「佢話佢唔怕嘅，講要講嘅嘢」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就張表示希望外國可以「做一啲嘢」，控方追問其意思，張解釋，黎稱希望外國能夠「對於中國採取敵對行動」，包括制裁。他表示整個5月氣氛緊張，尤其5月下旬人大會議訂立《國安法》後，當時黎稱要「一人一信」予時任美國總統。黎又在5、6月的飯盒會指「最近好忙」，因為很多外國傳媒排隊訪問他，而「佢話佢唔怕嘅，佢會照講，講佢要講嘅嘢，包括要求美國制裁中國」。黎曾提及覺得《國安法》「好嚴重」、「比佢預計更嚴重」，若真的實施的話，「香港經濟金融都冇㗎啦，《蘋果》都唔使旨意有得做」，因此他希望美國制裁中共。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張黎認為黃色經濟圈對抗爭有好處&quot;&gt;張：黎認為「黃色經濟圈」對抗爭有好處&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示4篇《蘋果》英文版報道，包括：於2020年7月14日刊登、由李平（楊清奇）所撰的〈Editorial: Who is Afraid of CCP Sanctions and Oppressions?（蘋論：中共的打壓與制裁不足畏）〉 ；於2020年7月18日刊登、由旅美作家「一劍飄塵」所撰的〈Will U.S. sanction Carrie Lam?（美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎？）〉；於2020年8月28日刊登、由香港監察創辦人 Benedict Rogers 所撰的〈Aversion to Beijing’s bellicose diplomacy is escalating in Europe〉；以及於2021年1月14日刊登、由 Glacier Kwong 鄺頌晴所撰的〈Round-up of all opposition politicians the HK version of Kaohisung Incident〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張確認上述4篇報道均是按着黎智英的編採指示執行，因都想關於爭取國際支持及關注，並希望外國會對中共及香港官員採取制裁行動，對抗中共對香港的打壓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，控方展示第4篇文章的內容，當中提及「香港人應該一同貢獻以保護我們的公民社會，支持在囚者及『黃色經濟圈』（“Hong Kong people should work together to devote ourselves to protecting our civil society, support for prisoners and the ‘yellow economic circle’.”）」。控方問黎有否支持「黃色經濟圈」；張解釋，黎認為只要抗爭一直繼續存在，「黃色經濟圈」就需要存在，因它對整個抗爭運動有好處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張黎指示推行撐小店計劃讓他們免費登廣告&quot;&gt;張：黎指示推行「撐小店」計劃、讓他們免費登廣告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張補充，《蘋果》曾經做過「撐小店」的分類廣告計劃，即免費讓小店在《蘋果》刊登廣告一段時間。在被警方搜查過、屬於他的日記簿當中，有提及黎叫他向廣告部跟進「撐小店」事宜。黎於2019年底的廣告部飯盒會當中，指示同事做這方面的分類小廣告。因為當時抗爭運動熱烈，參與抗爭的香港人會以政治取向，揀選所光顧的店舖，因此形成「黃色經濟圈」，而他們不會光顧「藍店」。直至2020年初疫情開始，計劃需暫停，後來於年中恢復。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（25日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第16日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹作供。控方提到黎智英於2020年12月開始還柙，張表示於黎還柙第2、3日有探訪他，並向黎請示「《蘋果日報》點樣運作落去」。當時黎的指示為：「唔使怕，繼續做，繼續做落去，照原來咁做。」於是張繼續按原本方針經營《蘋果》，並把黎的指示轉達予其他高層，向各人表示：「黎生都仲係好有戰意，叫我哋唔使驚。」控方播放「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段，被問到是否感害怕，黎表示：「我不可以害怕，如果我害怕就不能再發言及行動」，「否則我會變得無用，我會寧願死去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張黎稱不要付稿費予已流亡的投稿者免令人覺得資助&quot;&gt;張：黎稱不要付稿費予已流亡的投稿者、免令人覺得資助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示張劍虹與楊清奇的 WhatsApp 對話，張於2020年8月3日向楊發訊息：「清奇，政府通緝多名海外人士，說他們違反國安法，如果他們來稿，我們也不方便付稿費。內容當然也按原定方針把關」；楊回覆「收到」。張解釋，事前曾經與黎智英通話，就流亡或被通緝人士向《蘋果》投稿事宜請示黎。黎表示可照刊登流亡或被通緝人士的投稿，但「如果唔想被上綱上線，可以唔好畀稿費佢哋，有個平台登佢哋嘅稿就可以」。張表示，黎覺得他們可以獲得「香港人同情」，亦可在外國為香港發聲，但「無謂畀人覺得《蘋果日報》畀佢哋一啲資助行為」，因此不給予稿費。張認為楊有依照指示，但不記得流亡人士有否繼續投稿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張稱曾介紹寫政壇權鬥的日本人撰稿&quot;&gt;張稱曾介紹寫政壇權鬥的日本人撰稿&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，楊於2020年9月15日向張發訊息：「社長，我已聯絡高橋，談好交稿、修改、稿酬事宜。」張表示高橋為日本人，認識黎智英並經常訪問他。高橋主要寫日本政壇的權鬥，其立場是「反政府」。由於張認為其立場亦適合《蘋果》，因此在未有請示黎之下，於9月中介紹他協助為論壇寫稿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張稱於黎智英還柙後前往探訪-黎唔使怕繼續做落去&quot;&gt;張稱於黎智英還柙後前往探訪 黎：「唔使怕，繼續做落去」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後，控方提到黎智英於2020年12月開始還柙，並問張劍虹有否去探訪。張表示於黎還柙第2、3日有探訪他，並向黎請示「《蘋果日報》點樣運作落去」。當時黎的指示為：「唔使怕，繼續做，繼續做落去，照原來咁做。」於是張繼續按着原本的方針經營《蘋果》，包括「繼續支持抗爭，希望外國西方國家繼續關注香港情況，提供援助」，並自己主持飯盒會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張向其他高層轉達黎生仲係好有戰意&quot;&gt;張向其他高層轉達：黎生仲係好有戰意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，英文版仍舊繼續按照原本的方針運作，而黎智英的對談直播（Live Chat）及專欄「成敗樂一笑」則停止。其後張把黎的指示轉達予《蘋果》的高層，包括各部門的副總編輯及主管。張向各人表示：「黎生都仲係好有戰意，叫我哋唔使驚。」而各部門的人亦有依照指示繼續運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指自己還柙後沒有再給予指示&quot;&gt;張指自己還柙後沒有再給予指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，張確認自己於2021年6月17日被捕，翌日（18日）起還柙。他確認直至2021年6月30日，自己仍然為壹傳媒集團的行政總裁；直至2021年6月24日，他仍然是3間公司的董事。他表示自還柙後，自己沒有再向《蘋果》高層發出指示。他並不清楚公司事務由誰人接手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎於直播稱我不可以害怕否則會變得無用寧願死去&quot;&gt;黎於直播稱：我不可以害怕，否則會變得無用，寧願死去&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放兩節「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段，分別是2020年7月9日及30日，各時長17及35分鐘。首片段開始時，黎表示希望令更多人關注英文版《蘋果》，然後回答觀眾問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到《國安法》對香港的影響，黎表示《國安法》是香港的「喪鐘（Death Knell）」，在港從商人士會失去保護及自由，最後導致經濟衰落及衍生失業問題。黎被問到是否感到害怕，他表示「我不可以害怕，如果我害怕就不能再發言及行動」，「否則我會變得無用，我會寧願死去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於《國安法》對香港的風險，黎表示現時很多人打算移民，但自己卻沒有打算移民，若然情況變壞，妻兒可能會離開，而自己則留下來。不過沒有家人支持，他很難繼續前進。他又指，香港人追求自由的價值，因為經歷過英國殖民時代。黎最後強調，市民訂閱英文版能夠對傳媒起保護作用。最後有觀眾問黎早餐吃了甚麼食物，在庭上的黎妻聞後發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示文章，顯示事後《蘋果》轉載上述片段，標題為〈黎智英twitter直播精華 聲言毋懼國安法繼續留港抗爭〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎可能親中陣營見民主派初選成功感擔心&quot;&gt;黎：可能親中陣營見民主派初選成功感擔心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第二段片段，黎智英與壹傳媒獨立非執行董事 Mark Clifford 和美國在台協會前主席 Raymond Burghardt 對話。他們談及即將進行的立法會選舉，會否如期舉行。黎表示，有很多國家在疫情下仍然進行選舉，可能是親中陣營見民主派初選成功而感擔心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明續審，控方將就片段作出提問。法官問及控方何時會完成張的主問，控方指將於本周完結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s weaponization of trade is at the core of its building of an illiberal order. The Biden administration will need to think outside the box in deterring this practice.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is rampant speculation about whether Chinese president Xi Jinping will take military action against Taiwan by 2027, there is 100 percent certainty he will use economic coercion against unsuspecting governments and private companies. Over the past 15 years, China has used economic coercion against 18 countries and over 400 companies, causing tens of billions of dollars in damage, according to a unique data set created at CSIS. This practice, in particular, has heightened under Xi. If Beijing does not like a neighbor’s statement about Taiwan or Xinjiang or wants to press on a territorial dispute, it will leverage its vast market to intimidate and punish. These actions are generally unannounced and not based in any universal trade rule or domestic law. And this bullying, in China’s eyes, has worked. Targeted countries and firms self-censor on issues like Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang for fear of economic retaliation — threats which Beijing bandies about regularly like a mafia boss. As the Chinese ambassador to New Zealand noted, “An economic relationship in which China buys nearly a third of the country’s exports shouldn’t be taken for granted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s weaponization of trade is at the core of its building of an illiberal order. The Biden administration will need to think outside the box in deterring this practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent case is the Xi regime’s enacting of controls on exports of gallium and germanium — two high-tech metals used for production of everything from semiconductor chips to electric vehicles to satellites. China accounts for almost 100 percent of the world’s production of gallium and almost 70 percent of the world’s refinery production of germanium. Gallium is a by-product of bauxite and zinc ores for which there is no substitute, and germanium is a metal used in the production of fiber optics, for which there are substitute materials like silicon, but they come at the expense of performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world’s response to China’s weaponization of trade, however, has been to play defense. That is, countries respond by reducing supply chain dependence on China and finding alternative markets — what the Biden administration calls “de-risking.” Regarding gallium and germanium, there are efforts to build resilient supply chains among lower-volume producers, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Canada, and Belgium, to blunt the impact of China’s squeeze, even at higher costs. In another case, the United States and Europe have sought to mitigate the impact of China’s sanctions on Lithuania (for having a Taiwan representative office) through directing investment funds to the country, expanding market access for Lithuanian exports, and political support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this strategy is that countries cannot stop a bully only by playing defense. “De-risking” tries to lessen the pain inflicted by economic coercion in the moment but does nothing to stop future acts preemptively. The best way to do this in 2024 is to make Beijing understand that it will feel pain if it tries to weaponize trade against others such that it will be deterred. Like-minded countries will need to form a collective economic deterrence pact to promise counter-coercion to end further economic bullying by Xi Jinping. And they have the capabilities to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, the G7 countries plus Australia export 395 items with a trade value of over $37 billion to China, upon which Beijing is more than 70 percent dependent as a percentage of its total trade in those goods, and 153 items valued at $7.5 billion that China is over 90 percent dependent on (2022 figures), according to a unique data set compiled at CSIS. Moreover, the second- and third-largest exporters of these high-dependence goods are often like-minded partners. For example, to deter further Chinese economic coercion, Japan and the United States could threaten to curtail the export of silver powder (used for solar panel production) to China, where the two compose over 97 percent of China’s global supply. Australia and Canada could threaten action on exports of nickel powders (used for production of rechargeable batteries), where the two make up almost 80 percent of China’s global supply. Further, Japan and Germany could promise to control alloyed steel ingots to China (used for shipbuilding), as the two countries account for 82 percent of China’s imported supplies and China has no alternative domestic supply. The United States, Canada, France, and Italy could even leverage luxury goods like lobster and champagne, where the four make up nearly 90–100 percent of China’s imports. These trade disruptions would impose costs on China absent large domestic production sources for these high-dependence items. Countries feel they must kowtow to China because of its massive market, but they have enough leverage as a group to shape Beijing’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key, of course, is herding enough partners for a commitment that credibly signals the threat of counter-coercion to China. This will not be easy. Free riding is likely as companies may not want to play ball with a government economic deterrence strategy and others might seek opportunistic backfilling of the Chinese market. But countries should be motivated to join the cause because (1) they no longer want to live under the eternal, brooding shadow of China’s economic predation and (2) they know they are better off dealing with China as a group than alone. G7 leaders appear to have gotten this message in Hiroshima, Japan, in May 2023 with their collective statements about organizing to counter Chinese economic coercion. Meeting in the city of one of China’s most recent targets, Vilnius, Lithuania, in July, NATO leaders — including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand as part of the new “Asia-Pacific 4” appendage — made similar statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s predatory trade actions constitute a serious threat to the global order. Extreme times call for extreme measures. The purpose of a collective economic deterrence pact is not to burn down the liberal trading order through inciting trade wars but to try to salvage it from economic predation by one of its largest players. If China does not bully, then the threat of counter-coercion will never need to be exercised. Without a willingness to fight fire with fire, however, countries will forever be victimized by China’s weaponization of trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite the broad budget cuts elsewhere, Chinese government spending for the technology sector is skyrocketing, especially in the semiconductor sector, where U.S. export controls are most painful and threatening.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year 2023 brought technological competition between the United States and China to its most intense level yet. Will 2024 bring more of the same? Probably. There is little indication that China’s views, goals, or actions will change much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with China’s views. In September 2023, the head of China’s Ministry of State Security, Chen Yixin, published an article describing China’s strategic thinking on technology and national security. In it, Chen writes, “The most important competition is the increasingly fierce competition between great powers in cyberspace. . . . The most prominent [Chinese] shortcoming is that key and core technologies are controlled by others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of Chen’s essay, “cyberspace” refers not only to cyberattacks and espionage but also to the broader industrial landscape of digital technology with all of its economic and national security implications. The “key and core technologies” are dozens of Chinese dependencies on critical foreign technologies identified by the Chinese government, seven of which directly relate to the semiconductor industry. The “others” Chen refers to are, of course, the United States and its allies, who in recent years have sought to restrict China’s access to certain advanced technologies through export controls, especially in semiconductors and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A straightforward interpretation of Chen’s remarks is that he views technology as the most important zone of U.S.-China competition. Given Chen’s position as the head of China’s most important intelligence organization and that his speech was drawing heavily from Chinese president Xi Jinping’s latest ideological treatise, it is reasonable to assume his speech reflects the broadly shared views of China’s most senior leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings us to China’s goals. China’s most recent five-year economic plan stated China would “make technological self-sufficiency a strategic pillar of national development,” meaning it wants to free itself from foreign technological import dependencies. Many of Xi’s recent speeches have reiterated this goal, and the Chinese government is using both carrots and sticks to decouple Chinese firms from Western technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see why China would put technology atop its priority list. Technological advancement is among the most important inputs to the other major sources of national power, including economic and military power. In the comparison between the U.S. and Chinese economies, the simplest difference is that China has a population roughly four times larger, but the United States generates roughly six times the amount of economic output per person. The United States’ much higher economic productivity is largely due to its much higher level of technology across many more sectors of its economy. If China were to match the United States in technological sophistication, innovation, and widespread adoption, then China’s economic advantage over the United States might resemble its population advantage, meaning China’s economy would be four times larger than that of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In assessing Chinese strategic priorities, actions speak louder than words, and China’s actions provide considerable evidence that it views technological competition with the United States as its top priority. In the wake of China’s disastrous zero-Covid policy, property market crisis, and slowed economic growth, China’s local governments are facing a debt crisis so severe that some government agencies are unable to pay their employees’ salaries on time. Under such circumstances, China might have understandably cut back its investment in technological self-sufficiency. Instead, it did the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the broad budget cuts elsewhere, Chinese government spending for the technology sector is skyrocketing, especially in the semiconductor sector, where U.S. export controls are most painful and threatening. In 2018, New York Times columnist Li Yuan described the first round of semiconductor export controls under U.S. president Donald Trump’s administration as China’s “Sputnik moment,” making a comparison to the Soviet Union’s 1957 satellite launch, which led the United States to establish the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and dramatically increase spending on science and technology. Yuan’s comparison was apt. According to data collected by Chinese research firm JW Insights, China’s various local governments collectively spent nearly $65 billion in both 2021 and 2022 to support China’s semiconductor industry. If true, that amount would be more than two and a half times what the United States spends on NASA each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, China not only increased its already massive subsidies but also announced another $41 billion government-backed semiconductor investment fund. Amid China’s record youth unemployment, when many in China are calling for economic stimulus, Xi is advising China’s youth to “eat bitterness,” an idiom that means to suffer without complaining. Rapidly breaking free from dependence on foreign technology is evidently a much higher priority than reinvigorating economic growth or easing economic pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the future of the U.S.-China relationship depends upon the United States, not just China. However, U.S. officials largely agree with China about the importance of technology in the U.S.-China rivalry. In October 2022, U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken gave a speech in which he said, “We are at an inflection point. The post-Cold War world has come to an end, and there is intense competition underway to shape what comes next. And at the heart of that competition is technology.” More recently, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan’s essay in Foreign Affairs made similar points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States has the edge in its current technological level, China believes its own advantages may matter more. Xi often touts China’s “remarkable institutional superiority” and “administrative efficiency.” Recent Chinese failures, such as the zero-Covid policy, call such advantages into question, but they also highlight just how stubborn the Chinese leadership can be. In technology competition, China’s strategic focus, extraordinary funding, and stubbornness of policy direction is real and should not be underestimated. The Chinese government’s cheering of a new Huawei smartphone in mid-2023 also shows that it is now willing to openly defy U.S. law and export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of financial resources, the CHIPS for America fund, one of the largest U.S. industrial policy investments in recent memory, allocated more than $50 billion in semiconductor industry support, but that was spread over a five-year period. It is vastly less than China is spending each year for its own semiconductor industry. Even amid such incredible budgets, comparatively paltry sums needed for core elements of the overall strategy go ignored. As just one example, technology export controls are a key element of the strategy for the administration of U.S. president Joe Biden and a key source of Chinese anxiety. However, the budget for the U.S. Department of Commerce bureau charged with effectively designing, administering, and enforcing them has actually declined in inflation-adjusted terms. Thankfully, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has recently started arguing for the need to rectify this policy incoherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, there is little to suggest the overall picture will change much in 2024, especially on the Chinese side. Tactics may change, perhaps with a new emphasis on import restrictions, but both the United States and China are likely to continue to desire every advantage in their deepening technological competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What might make a difference, though, is an improvement in the United States’ ability to align its many policy choices in pursuit of those desires, including choices that affect the government’s capacity to realistically execute its own policies. That will require policymakers to maintain focus not only on high-profile and politically charged issues but also on the comparatively banal steps needed to significantly improve U.S. government speed and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the right views and goals matters, but ensuring the U.S. government can effectively monitor and analyze key technology developments, as well as design and execute relevant policies, matters just as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Although few multinational companies (MNCs) are outright abandoning China, some are selling off some of their China-based assets and diversifying their places of production and supply chains, and few MNCs are investing in China for the first time.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is rarely, if ever, a consensus about the state of China’s economy. To some extent, this is the product of ambiguous data. Few trust Chinese official economic growth data, and there is no agreement on what might serve as a suitable proxy to evaluate the economy’s performance. Even if official data were more reliable, the country’s massive size and internal variation create additional opportunities for disagreement. Despite widespread pessimism, inside and outside of China, about the trajectory of the economy, significant differences still persist. Although China is less transparent than ever, a prominent source of disagreement are the initial positions of observers, who inevitably emphasize different elements of the economy. Their contrasting analyses translate into alternative policy implications for the United States and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly&quot;&gt;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the past 30 years, evaluations of China’s economy — both inside and outside the country — were divided into three camps, what I’ve previously called “the good, the bad, and the ugly,” inspired by the title of the famous 1966 movie of this name. The “good” perspective has painted a positive picture of rapid growth built on a gradualist approach to guide the economy through multiple transitions — from plan to market, rural to urban, agriculture to industry and services, and investment-led to consumption. In this story, China’s growth has generated opportunities for other countries in what Beijing would likely call a “win-win outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “bad” perspective has highlighted a highly inefficient financial system, which has taken savings from households and disproportionately funneled capital to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and questionable state-led pet projects, creating a buildup of debt that would result in either a gradual sclerosis and anemic growth or a massive financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those holding the “ugly” view have been highly worried about China’s economic trajectory, not because of immovable structural issues such as debt, but because of poor policy choices by China’s leadership that have largely favored expanding state control over supporting market mechanisms. From this perspective, reversing course, in the direction of liberalization, could provide a foundation for greater productivity and continued long-term growth, even if not at the rate of earlier years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-bad-and-the-ugly&quot;&gt;The Bad and the Ugly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last five years there has been a fundamental reordering of perspectives. There is almost no one, inside or outside of China, holding up the “good” banner any longer. That is because under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China has largely backtracked on the gradualist “reform and opening” strategy that had yielded success for so long. Internationally, China’s global footprint has grown dramatically, and domestically, the services sector and consumption are larger parts of the economy; but broader liberalization of economic activity and an educed role for the state are no longer at the center of the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the gravity of opinion has shifted in a far more pessimistic direction. A few, consistent with the bad perspective, focus on one or another structural issue, such as debt or demography, or a combination of them. More often, the bad and ugly perspectives are merging, with a criticism of Xi’s highly statist approach and specific policy measures, which observers believe are reducing productivity and undermining China’s growth prospects. Xi may have tinkered with liberalizing reforms early in his tenure, but on the whole he has reversed course across the board. Whenever given a choice between control and markets, Xi has invariably almost always chosen the former. Hence, state intervention to halt the stock market’s fall, a draconian zero-Covid policy, the crackdown on private tech firms, the erosion of independent corporate governance institutions within companies, an emphasis of inequality over growth, and the pursuit of technological independence over integrating into global supply chains. Under Xi, almost every policy now is framed in terms of security: energy security, food security, financial security, technology security, health security and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concerns of economists draw heavily on the deep pessimism and, in some cases, outright sense of despondence widespread among China’s broader populace and its business community. Private conversations and interviews yield a wave of criticism of the political and policy environment and the real estate crisis and fall in home values, as well as the fears about possible war and isolation due to increased tensions with the United States. These concerns add up to a profound sense of uncertainty about the future and a loss of confidence in China’s overall direction. This has translated economically into stagnant consumer demand and restrained investment by business, meaning fewer new jobs and slower economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global business community is particularly worried about U.S.-China security tensions, but it shares the same worries about China’s overall policy direction. Although few multinational companies (MNCs) are outright abandoning China, some are selling off some of their China-based assets and diversifying their places of production and supply chains, and few MNCs are investing in China for the first time. Excitement about China has waned among foreign private equity firms because of the uncertain prospect that the Chinese companies in which they invest will be able to go public. Hedge funds and other institutional investors are also worried about short- and long-term returns, viewing other options as less risky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-mean&quot;&gt;The Mean&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the broader pessimistic shift, there is one perspective that is more sanguine about China’s current economic prospects. Techno-nationalists, who believe a country’s economic and military power comes primarily through its ability to dominate advanced technologies, see Chinese industrial policy and all of its tools as a strength of its system. Not only is this the view of Xi and his inner circle, some techno-nationalists in the United States and elsewhere conclude that China has made enormous technological strides to overtake the West in critical sectors and become a peer in others. They point to Chinese successes in telecom equipment, high-speed rail, electric vehicles, solar, wind, and AI as evidence of China’s growing strength. And they discount the inefficiencies of China’s economy by arguing that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has unlimited financial resources, the political power to dictate domestic company behavior and consumer choices, and a large enough domestic market and other resources to withstand and overcome Western restrictions and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This optimistic view of China’s techno-nationalist approach is challenged by those who point to the very mixed record of Chinese industrial policy initiatives and China’s continued technological dependence on others. Rather than a well-oiled machine, they see mounting internal tensions and policymaking dysfunction that will mean a continued sizeable gap between China’s technology policy ambitions and actual commercial outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-implications-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Policy Implications for the United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These contrasting views of China’s economic trajectory come with quite different policy prescriptions for the United States and other advanced market economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although now out of favor, if China were still pursuing, or would return to, a strategy of reduced state intervention at home and greater liberalization internationally, in line with the good perspective, the appropriate response from the United States and others would be an approach of patient integration. Akin to the long-term engagement strategy, the United States would rely on a web of multilateral institutions (such as the World Trade Organization), regional arrangements (such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP), and bilateral agreements to encourage China to move in a market-oriented direction and penalize it in the specific instances where it does not meet its commitments. Given how far China has deviated from this path, the likelihood of restoring a consensus in Washington in favor of such an approach is extremely low. Those hoping for such a return to a “reform and opening” strategy could help identify a series of steps China would need to take to prove its intentions to domestic and international audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those in the bad and ugly camps, which are now in ascendance, have less faith that China under Xi will accept any significant liberalization of its economy and are concerned about the effect of China’s non-market practices on the rest of the world’s economy as well as the national security and human rights risks that extensive connectivity may pose to the United States and its allies. Hence, they council a combination of continuing to take advantage of continuing commercial opportunities, blunting the impact of China’s economic distortions and national security vulnerabilities, and strengthening the United States’ own economic foundations and the international rules-based order. This encapsulates the analysis and approach of the Biden administration, with its emphasis on de-risking (export controls, investment screening, supply chain diversification, etc.), promoting the reinvigoration of manufacturing and technology innovation at home, and developing a bilateral agenda on reducing barriers to China’s market, trying to constrain Chinese industrial policy, and seeking to cooperate in areas of common interest, including public health and climate change. A central underlying principle of this approach is the need to coordinate and align policies with like-minded countries to ensure that efforts at de-risking are effective and do not isolate the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those in the “mean” camp, who are most impressed by China’s industrial policy prowess but also deeply worried about its effect on the United States and global economy, are far more skeptical that the United States can effectively calibrate a relationship with China in a way that aligns with American national interests. They point to the expansion of China’s manufacturing in emerging industries and continuing large trade surplus with the United States and others. As a result, they are in favor of outright decoupling and trying to isolate China, while at the same time pushing the United States to develop its own comprehensive industrial policy to rebuild its manufacturing capacity and dominate the technologies of the future. This perspective is reflected in the analysis of former U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, and in a bipartisan report issued in late 2023 by the U.S. House of Representatives’ Select Committee on the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If past is prologue, the various schools of thought about China’s economy will continue to contend with each other without an ultimate resolution to their disagreement. But the debate is likely to become even more contentious in 2024, in part because China’s economy is likely to rebound over the course of the year and in part because of the 2024 U.S. election season. Rather than be forlorn over a potentially heated yet inconclusive period of attacks and counterattacks, Washington (and other Western capitals) could use this year as a chance to finally push the contending views to not talk past each other and clearly evaluate their relative merits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, analysts should collectively answer three interrelated questions. First, what are the strengths and weaknesses of China’s economy and how should credit and blame be apportioned? For example, where there are successes (such as in mobile phones and electric vehicles), are these the result of wise industrial policies or market liberalization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, how does China’s economic behavior and performance affect the United States and the rest of the world? The policy community still does not have sufficient understanding of the overall effect on the American economy, in part because there is not agreement about which metrics should be used or which sources of data are reliable. At the same time, analysts and policymakers need to carry out a comprehensive discussion of the risks and benefits of extensive commercial ties and interdependence for the United States’ national security. The risks are increasingly obvious, but the benefits of connectivity — for improving American innovation, creating lines of communication, and increasing the costs of Chinese aggression — deserve renewed evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having analyzed China’s economy and the effects on the United States, Washington needs to answer one final question: What are the costs and benefits of the de-risking approach the Biden administration has taken over the past few years, and what are the potential results of the alternative strategies of a return to engagement or a comprehensive strategy aimed at decoupling? To date, no overall assessment has been done of what the current approach has achieved and whether it makes sense to continue forward or move in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although an intense debate on China during an election year could produce a substantial amount of heat, if carried out thoughtfully, it could produce much-needed light as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is rapidly developing a robust defense industrial base to deter, fight, and win a war against the United States.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is rapidly developing a robust defense industrial base to deter, fight, and win a war against the United States. As secretary of the U.S. Air Force Frank Kendall III remarked in 2023, “China is preparing for a war and specifically for a war with the United States.” While China is ramping up its industrial base, however, the U.S. defense industrial base lacks the surge capacity and flexibility to meet U.S. military needs. Unless there are urgent changes, the United States risks weakening deterrence and undermining its warfighting capabilities against China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Nobel Prize–winning economist Thomas Schelling wrote, effective deterrence is a function of both the intentions and capabilities of the deterrer. For the United States, this means building sufficient military capabilities to deter such actions as a Chinese invasion of Taiwan as well as signaling U.S. resolve to use those capabilities if necessary. An important aspect of military capabilities is a country’s defense industrial base, which includes the set of companies involved in the research, design, development, production, delivery, and maintenance of weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, China has ramped up its defense industrial base in several ways. One is an improvement in the process of how China researches, develops, and produces advanced weapons systems. Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment William LaPlante called China “really impressive” in discussing China’s defense industrial base at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He also remarked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They’ve developed . . . really good high-end capability in numbers. So they’ve done the development and the development has been pretty continuous and not just one thing. They place multiple bets. We don’t do that. . . . We very rarely will place multiple bets and . . . [have] three different development activities going on. We used to do that. We don’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These efforts have improved Chinese air, land, naval, space, and cyber capabilities. For example, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is developing and producing a significant number of medium- and long-range missiles that can strike U.S. and allied land, air, and sea bases across the Indo-Pacific region. The PLA is also constructing and deploying integrated air defense systems to challenge U.S. forces attempting to operate near such areas as the Taiwan Strait. China now boasts three of the world’s 10 largest defense companies. Aviation Industry Corporation of China, China North Industries Group Corporation Limited, and China South Industries Group Corporation now rival such U.S. behemoths as RTX (formerly Raytheon), Northrup Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese capabilities are particularly robust in shipbuilding. China’s ability to rapidly build large numbers of ships represents a strategic advantage in a prolonged war. China is now the world’s largest shipbuilder. It has a shipbuilding capacity that is over 230 times greater than the United States. According to Carlos Del Toro, secretary of the Navy, one of China’s shipyards has more capacity than all U.S. shipyards combined. “That presents a real threat,” Del Toro acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these efforts are impressive, China still faces challenges. For example, the Chinese defense industry relies on foreign parts in several areas, such as engines and engine parts for diesel submarines and advanced aircraft. In addition, China struggles in such areas as designing specialized sound-absorbing coatings, dealing with vibration suppression issues created by steam turbines, and decreasing the sonar signature of its hull designs. Finally, China’s defense industrial base — and the Chinese Communist Party and PLA more broadly — suffer from extensive graft and corruption, which likely affects the quality of military systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, China is getting better. But the United States is lagging in several areas of its defense industrial base, weakening the prospect of deterrence and warfighting. For instance, the United States faces a serious shortfall of munitions — especially long-range precision munitions — and other weapons systems for a protracted war in such areas as the Indo-Pacific. In addition, Congress has dragged its feet in fixing contracting problems, such as multiyear procurement. Supply chain challenges remain serious, including an insufficient supply of solid rocket motors, ball bearings, microelectronics, and seekers for munitions. Today’s workforce is also inadequate to meet the demands of the defense industrial base, and the U.S. labor market struggles to provide enough workers with the right skills to meet defense demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, all is not lost. Far from it. The United States has made progress in some areas of the industrial base. For example, the Department of Defense has ramped up production lines for some weapons systems, such as 155-millimeter rounds, Stinger air defense systems, the Javelin anti-tank weapons system, and Patriot Advanced Capability–3 (PAC-3) air defense systems. In addition, the U.S. private sector is the most innovative in the world, and the United States has a strong track record of eventually ramping up its defense industrial base during periods of crisis, such as World War II, the Korean War, and the buildup under President Ronald Reagan at the height of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States needs to take several steps to revitalize its defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Department of Defense and Congress need to expand the use of multiyear contracts to create sustained demand signals that will promote investment in the industrial base. Multiyear contracts have typically been reserved for only the most expensive acquisition platforms and systems, such as large navy ships. Yet multiyear procurement is important for munitions critical for deterrence and warfighting in the Indo-Pacific, such as the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile ( JASSM), PAC-3, Standard Missile–6 (SM-6), and AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Department of Defense and Congress should allocate additional funding for contracts and other incentives, such as tax incentives, regulatory relief, and long-term contracts, to build and maintain spare production capacity. This funding can be used to modernize and expand facilities and develop flexible production. The Department of Defense maintains stockpiles of key munitions, minerals, chemicals, technology, and medical supplies, but it needs to better manage inventory and stockpile planning to decrease near-term risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the United States needs to diversify the supplier base for the defense industry and invest in new production methods. The Department of Defense should look for opportunities to assist companies with upskilling and reskilling workers by offering incentives, such as expanding investments in the Manufacturing Innovation Institutes and in programs designed to support the talent necessary for defense-related manufacturing and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps are important to strengthen the U.S. defense industrial base to deter China and prepare for contingencies in case deterrence fails. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in his victory speech in December 1940, one year before the attack on Pearl Harbor, implored the nation to revitalize its defense industry. It is a message that is just as relevant today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We must be the great arsenal of democracy. For us this is an emergency as serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s space capabilities are rapidly growing in quantity and quality, accelerated by clear political will, government prioritization, and large state and private investments.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is intent on surpassing the United States in space. President Xi Jinping has articulated a “space dream” for China to be the leading space power by 2049. While much has been made about the space developments by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), less attention has been paid to China’s commercial space activities. This new dimension of strategic competition will challenge the United States diplomatically, economically, technologically, and militarily, and is one to watch in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s space capabilities are rapidly growing in quantity and quality, accelerated by clear political will, government prioritization, and large state and private investments. Aerospace was designated a top priority in Beijing’s Made in China 2025 strategic initiative, aimed at achieving technological breakthroughs and boosting its innovation base. China broke its launch record in 2023 and has over 800 operational satellites in orbit, marking one of the swiftest climbs in the history of any modern space program. China is now second only to the United States in its total number of in-orbit satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, China’s commercial space sector has flourished, enabled by policy changes and fueled by private and state investments. In 2014, the Chinese government modified a restrictive policy to open select space sectors to private investment. According to a 2021 European market assessment, China is now leading the world in terms of number of commercial space companies established, and it has surpassed all but the United States in the number of space startups receiving funding. Further, according to a 2023 U.S. space investment report, China is second to the United States in space companies receiving private capital, drawing 28 percent of cumulative private market equity investment since 2014 (compared to 48 percent for U.S. companies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year 2023 was a breakthrough for China’s commercial space launch activities. In April 2023, its first commercial space launch occurred with the Tianlong-2 medium launch vehicle built by Beijing Tianbing Technology, also known as Space Pioneer. In July 2023, another private Chinese company, LandSpace, launched the world’s first methane-liquid oxygen rocket, significant in its increased performance, efficiency, and handling. No less than seven Chinese commercial companies conducted or were planning to conduct space launches in 2023, with the pace expected to pick up in 2024. Beijing is expanding its space launch sites to accommodate this commercial growth, including plans to further develop the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on Hainan island as a commercial spaceport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese commercial space companies are progressing in other areas as well. In a 2021 presentation from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, China was assessed as the global leader in three of nine categories of commercial space-based imagery capabilities, matching U.S. commercial providers, which maintained the lead in only three categories. Chinese entities have plans to rival U.S. commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) broadband constellations. A 13,000-satellite network (GuoWang) would be the country’s answer to SpaceX’s Starlink, with large deployments anticipated to start in 2024. Another 12,000-satellite constellation (G60 Starlink) is also in the works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, as China pursues the same economic, security, and prestige benefits that other space powers have long enjoyed, it will be competing globally with the United States across these areas for influence, market share, and international norm setting. If the United States does not win this competition, there are both economic and national security consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a play from its 5G playbook, such space-based information, communications, and terrestrial infrastructure are natural offerings in Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative but come at a price. The proliferation of Chinese LEO broadband services could boost Beijing’s presence in foreign terrestrial networks, providing it with greater control over international data flows, allowing it to spread techno-authoritarian norms, and granting it extensive intelligence and coercive powers. Chinese satellite imagery companies could provide imagery of U.S. and partner forces to those seeking to harm U.S. interests. A prime example is Spacety China, a commercial company sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in early 2023 for selling imagery collected over Ukraine to enable Wagner Group combat operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could question whether these activities are truly commercial. In many cases, these commercial entities maintain ties to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as subsidiaries or spin-offs, receive top-down support from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and enjoy large tracts of funding, municipal government support, and regulatory leeway. They offer a pathway for innovation and technological advancement outside of China’s SOEs and a way to reduce reliance on international companies or suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the CCP has made clear that technological advancements made by civil and commercial entities must also aid the military. Beijing’s military-civilian fusion (MCF) policy facilitates the transfer of technology and investments from the commercial sector to the military. Its 2017 National Intelligence Law requires that “any organization or citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with state intelligence work” and keep the work a secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does the United States compete? It starts with taking a more strategic view of the commercial space sector. U.S. industry still leads in advanced space technology and private capital, though that lead is eroding. A strong space industrial base, deep bench of technical talent, and vibrant innovation ecosystem comprised of space start-ups and traditional aerospace companies with diversified revenue bases are in the nation’s economic and security interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the approach to space commerce and space diplomacy will need to evolve. Space capabilities are a form of soft power. Allies and partners are expanding their space programs and budgets, creating greater opportunities for closer cooperation, from Australia and the United Kingdom to Japan, South Korea, and India, as well as partners in the Middle East and Latin America. U.S. commercial space capabilities are a tool in the international cooperation tool kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, with the rise of China’s space industry and global diffusion of space technology and capital, international partners have an array of options. As a matter of U.S. policy and economics, it is far preferred that U.S. space entities be their partner of choice, not Chinese ones. But U.S. export policies must be modernized to enable such cooperation on space technology, which has long been subject to the same constraints as missile and munitions technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, maintaining U.S. technological leadership means not just preventing the transfer of technology to the PRC but also setting the conditions for the U.S. commercial space sector to prosper and stay ahead of the competition. The year 2024 extends the period of rapid technological change, with the private sector leading in many areas of technological innovation. The government should seek greater adoption and integration of commercial technologies to support mission needs, taking advantage of their speed and agility and the private capital being invested in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s commercial space sector is just getting started. There is no time to waste to position the U.S. space industry in the most competitive position possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To demonstrate resolve, the United States must rely on both military and political tools. . . . Reduced reliance on nuclear weapons could signal that U.S. leadership lacks the stomach to uphold security commitments.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 bipartisan Strategic Posture Commission calls for a change to the United States’ nuclear deterrence policy, concluding “the fundamentals of America’s deterrence strategy remain sound, but the application of that strategy must change to address the 2027–2035 threat environment.” China’s nuclear buildup over the past decade was one of the drivers of the commission’s conclusion that the United States needs to make “adjustments” in U.S. nuclear capabilities to effectively deter Beijing. To be sure, capabilities are a crucial part of a deterrence strategy. But an equally important tool is the credibility of U.S. commitments. The United States needs to ensure demonstrating resolve is part of any deterrence strategy in the face of a determined and patient adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, China has significantly expanded its strategic capabilities. The Department of Defense’s 2023 China military power report concluded, “Compared to the PLA’s [People’s Liberation Army] nuclear modernization efforts a decade ago, current efforts dwarf previous attempts in both scale and complexity.” Additionally, Chinese president Xi Jinping has ordered the military to prepare for an invasion of Taiwan by 2027, though Chinese leadership has since denied this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence is a combination of capabilities, credibility, and communication. Successful deterrence requires understanding what an adversary values most and holding it at risk in order to impose an unacceptable cost. China’s nuclear expansion presents a new set of deterrence challenges in regard to targeting, posture, and allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Posture Commission recommends “holding at risk key elements of their [Chinese and Russian] leadership, the security structure maintaining the leadership in power, their nuclear and conventional forces, and their war supporting industry.” Such action may require expanding or changing the makeup of the U.S. arsenal. Some experts, however, have argued that the United States simply needs the ability to “inflict catastrophic damage against both China and Russia.” On the surface, this approach would seem to lack the tailoring necessary for effective deterrence and assumes a one-size-fits-all approach. For any targeting strategy, improved understanding of what adversaries value will be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration under U.S. president Joe Biden has yet to clarify a strategy for deterring two peer competitors, including China. There are at least two important points of debate about such a strategy, as captured in a recent CSIS report. The first point of debate is about the nuclear force posture and the required mix of capabilities. Some experts argue the United States will need to expand its nuclear arsenal, such as by uploading warheads, but will not need to match Russia and China in combined numbers. Others suggest the United States should shift investment away from nuclear weapons toward advanced conventional weapons and new technologies while also strengthening resilience in nuclear command and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second area of debate is how to extend deterrence and assure U.S. allies. One side of the debate focuses on the value of capabilities, such as a new sea-launched cruise missile, in demonstrating commitment to allies, deterring regional aggression, and buttressing existing conventional capabilities. Others argue that allies should take on greater responsibility for their own security but through close consultation and communication with the United States, and that any U.S. deployments could provoke escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to see these debates as a binary between more or less capabilities misses important nuance about the political motives behind a deterrence strategy. Specifically, the debates miss a key question for U.S. political and military leaders: Does the United States have the resolve to defend its interests and allies? U.S. resolve has come into question in recent years following the failure to respond to Syrian chemical weapons attacks, the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and ongoing domestic debates about military aid to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolve is about both stakes and stomach. Seemingly, the stakes in a Taiwan crisis, for example, are greater for China than for the United States, just as they appear to be for Russia in the current war in Ukraine. At the same time, the consequences for U.S. global leadership and allies’ confidence in U.S. security guarantees hinge on the U.S. response to an attack on an ally or partner. But even in scenarios where the stakes are evenly matched, there is a question of whether or not the U.S. public has the stomach to commit to military intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate resolve, the United States must rely on both military and political tools. The afore-mentioned debate about the right mix of capabilities must account for how allies and adversaries alike could perceive a shift to conventional forces. Reduced reliance on nuclear weapons could signal that U.S. leadership lacks the stomach to uphold security commitments. This does not mean the United States should massively expand its arsenal; rather it can take steps to signal resolve, such as more unambiguous statements about commitment to allies’ security, exercising, and consultation. The Biden administration has already pursued some of these measures, but delays in budget approvals and lack of visibility for nuclear issues could undermine such efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolve is also a political exercise. U.S. adversaries and allies know of U.S. domestic political polarization. Russian president Vladimir Putin seems to be content with a temporary stalemate in Ukraine while he waits in hopes of former U.S. president Donald Trump’s reelection. Xi may similarly be waiting for a change in administration that will see many of Biden’s regional initiatives overturned, such as AUKUS and the Nuclear Consultative Group dialogue with South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States works to deter China, assure U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific region, and demonstrate resolve vis-à-vis Beijing, it will need to ensure its efforts do not come at the cost of credibility with European allies. Security for Seoul should not come at the expense of credibility with Warsaw. Capabilities will play an important role in demonstrating resolve in both theaters, though U.S. domestic politics, ultimately, have become a problem for nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The surge in the global supply and demand for both a spectrum of long-range standoff capabilities and the means to contend with them is a defining feature of a new missile age.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of the Pentagon’s last two National Defense Strategy documents have identified China as a strategic and pacing threat to the United States and its allies. Within the military dimension of that strategic competition, an increasingly diverse, numerous, and sophisticated spectrum of aerial and missile threats has assumed an outsized importance. Once regarded as a niche or boutique problem, these missile threats have now become weapons of choice. The surge in the global supply and demand for both a spectrum of long-range standoff capabilities and the means to contend with them is a defining feature of a new missile age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, missile defense efforts have largely been directed at rogue state ballistic missile threats, especially from those armed with weapons of mass destruction. The threat from major powers represents a far more complex problem. U.S. air and missile defense efforts require considerably more adaptation than that which has been undertaken to date to contend with the scale and urgency of this threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least five areas of improvement are worth consideration to adapt U.S. air and missile defenses to better contend with the military competition with major powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that of policy. Not so long ago, it seemed in many quarters unthinkable to put Russia or China in the same sentence as missile defense. Over the past two years, the successful engagement of Kinzhals and hundreds of other high-end missiles in Ukraine have decisively chipped away at the idea that such threats are unstoppable. Now it should be unthinkable not to contemplate active defense. While still relying upon nuclear forces to deter large-scale, strategic nuclear attacks, the specter of nonnuclear strategic attacks makes such defensive measures indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second area, the principal effort to realize the defense of nonnuclear strategic attack, is the collection of efforts to provide air and missile defense for the island of Guam. Besides being U.S. sovereign territory and homeland of Americans, the principal reason for defensive investments for Guam has everything to do with the military forces dependent upon the island for power projection and deterrence. While passive defense measures should be maximized fully, some things that cannot be moved or hidden must be defended. Doing so will require every tool in the toolbox of today’s air defenders and the development of new ones. To defend against the full spectrum of threats from a near-peer in their backyard will require integration among several air and missile defense systems, not just to create a common air picture but to achieve integrated fire control to optimize and deconflict engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third capability area is the specific area of cruise missile defense, relevant not just to Guam but to bases throughout the United States Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) and beyond. Garden-variety cruise missiles represent one of the most underappreciated, high-capacity, and near-term threats to U.S. forces and the homeland. The U.S. Army’s efforts for cruise missile defense will need to be kept on schedule and expanded. Since being named the lead service for air and cruise missile defense of the homeland, the U.S. Air Force is advancing critical work on domain awareness and over-the-horizon radars. Further work will be required to increase cruise missile intercept capacity both in the homeland and in the Pacific, much of which will likely need to be ground-based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the lower end of the aerial threat spectrum is the need to counter the seemingly humble but increasingly ubiquitous category of systems called unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Despite receiving their own category, UAS threats might be conceived as the next generation of the categories previously dubbed fixed wing, rotary wing, and cruise missiles. As the next chapter of air defense, counter-UAS (C-UAS) will require organizational and training changes, not just for dedicated air defenders but across the entire Joint Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States does not get to pick which parts of the air and missile threat spectrum China will mix and match to hold U.S. forces at risk. The fifth and final category is, therefore, not optional. The ability to defeat high-speed maneuvering threats, or various kinds of so-called hypersonic missiles, represents a necessary capability to counter significant Chinese investments in the area. These include boost glide vehicles, scramjet powered cruise missiles, orbital bombardment, and space planes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important progress has been made so far for the first component, space-based sensors capable of tracking unpredictable missiles from birth to death — but the capability is still far from being realized. Questions remain about schedule and fire control requirements for these forthcoming sensor layers. A second component, the kinetic or non-kinetic means to defeat these threats, must also be developed with all deliberate speed. Past aversions to space-based capability must likewise be overcome. Although the implications of embracing space as a warfighting domain have yet to be fully internalized, advanced capabilities in and from space will be critical to the future of missile defense and defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not get to choose which sort of threats China will pose. The specter of complex, structured, and integrated missile attacks requires attention to the full spectrum of defenses, from mud to space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Overall, 2024 is likely to be a determining year for cross-strait relations. If the survey results reflect Beijing’s calculus, China is likely to further escalate coercion and demonstrate its displeasure against Taiwan beyond what it has done during the Tsai administration.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year 2024 will be critical for determining cross-strait dynamics for at least the next four years, if not longer. Current Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) who has served for two terms, is stepping down. The election of current Taiwan vice president and DPP candidate William Lai on January 13, 2024, will shift cross-strait dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beijings-approach-toward-taiwan-will-become-more-coercive&quot;&gt;Beijing’s Approach toward Taiwan Will Become More Coercive&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2023, prior to the Taiwan elections, the CSIS China Power team conducted a survey of leading U.S. and Taiwan experts to help forecast what to expect in 2024. The survey showed that over 80 percent of leading thinkers in both regions believed that China would not maintain its current approach toward Taiwan after the elections. Instead, they believed Beijing was approaching a fork in the road, where it could adopt starkly different ways of dealing with the island depending on if China views the winning Taiwan leader as more pro-China or pro-independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surveyed experts believed that a candidate who was more preferred by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) — such as Kuomintang (KMT) leader Hou Yu-ih or Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) leader Ko Wen-je — and was willing to affirm support for the 1992 Consensus in one form or another could encourage Beijing to improve ties with the island. This could come in the form of more PRC political or economic “carrots” or reduction in the use of “sticks” or coercion against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, 46 percent of Taiwan experts were optimistic, believing that China would unilaterally improve ties with the island if one of its more preferred candidates won. This contrasted with 46 percent of U.S. experts who assessed that the newly elected Taiwan president would need to showcase goodwill first before China would take a positive step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents were less certain how Beijing would respond if its least preferred candidate, William Lai, won the Taiwan presidency. China views Lai as significantly more provocative and pro-independence than Tsai. Here, the results from the CSIS China Power survey were mixed. Half of U.S. and Taiwan experts believed that China would escalate against the island in the event of a Lai presidency, regardless of what the new Taiwan president does — indicating that China’s anxieties and deep-seated animosity toward Lai likely clouds and shapes PRC thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this logic holds, it is possible that China may react more negatively and strongly to Lai even if he embraces the exact same actions as Tsai. Similarly, China could react more negatively toward U.S. support to Lai, including against high-level congressional visits to Taiwan as well as U.S. arms sales to the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wide-ranging-views-on-how-china-could-escalate&quot;&gt;Wide-Ranging Views on How China Could Escalate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of how Beijing could respond to Lai’s victory, the majority of U.S. and Taiwan experts believed that China would reserve its most escalatory measures until at least after Lai is inaugurated on May 20, 2024 (or even later, after he has implemented significant policy changes). China had already increased pressure on Taiwan in the lead-up to the elections, and this buildup could continue post-election. Over a third of Taiwan experts, however, were worried that China would embrace its most escalatory response against Taiwan after the election but before the inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, even in the event of Lai’s victory, 60 percent of U.S. experts believed that the most escalatory option that China would take in 2024 is a large-scale military exercise encircling Taiwan (achieving temporary blockade-like effects). A handful of U.S. experts believe that if dynamics worsen, there is a possibility that China could quarantine, blockade, or even invade Taiwan in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan experts were less pessimistic. Forty-nine percent assessed that China will maximize non-military coercion of Taiwan. This could include China’s efforts to undermine and stir chaos within Taiwan’s democracy, PRC economic coercion of the island, as well as China’s attempts to squeeze the island’s international space. This is more than the 43 percent of Taiwan participants who think China will launch a large-scale military exercise. A handful of Taiwan experts believed that China could quarantine Taiwan, but none assessed that China would blockade or invade the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-to-expect-in-2024&quot;&gt;What to Expect in 2024&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, 2024 is likely to be a determining year for cross-strait relations. If the survey results reflect Beijing’s calculus, China is likely to further escalate coercion and demonstrate its displeasure against Taiwan beyond what it has done during the Tsai administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discrepancy in the survey between U.S. and Taiwan expert views showcases how difficult it is to forecast potential PRC courses of action given the wide range of political, economic, and military tools that Beijing could leverage against Taipei. Whereas U.S. experts tend to focus on PRC military activities as most escalatory and problematic, Taiwan experts are slightly more worried about other types of PRC actions in the political, economic, and information domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, Beijing is likely to embrace whatever political, economic, or military measures it believes will best assert its control over Taiwan and allow Beijing to make “progress” on unification. Beijing will likely use a combination of different and wide-ranging measures against the island. In addition, China’s willingness to escalate large-scale military exercises around Taiwan in August 2022 and April 2023 suggest that Xi is willing to push forward on Taiwan even if such actions could trigger potential costs and international blowback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has also been much speculation on whether internal PRC conditions, such as the state of China’s economy, will significantly dampen or elevate Beijing’s appetite to take risk vis-à-vis Taiwan. The CSIS China Power survey finds that 50 percent of leading U.S. experts assess that a sharp, prolonged PRC economic downturn will not impact potential PRC use of force against Taiwan. A dominant reasoning is that strategic and political factors will determine whether China decides to use significant military force against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan experts, however, were more divided and believed China’s economic conditions mattered more. Thirty-seven percent did not believe China’s domestic economic troubles impacted PRC use of force against the island; 34 percent believed they would decrease PRC use of force; and 29 percent believe they would increase the likelihood of use of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to carefully monitor conditions within the PRC, but for now, the main determinant of China’s approach to Taiwan in 2024 and beyond is likely to be how China perceives Lai’s words and actions, particularly after he assumes the Taiwan presidency in late May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Precisely because a direct attack on Taiwan brings unacceptable risk to Beijing, Xi is therefore likely disposed to ramp up coercive actions that seek to demoralize the Taiwan people and, crucially, create scenarios where the U.S. commitment to Taiwan is clearly and publicly tested.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is certain that Chinese leader Xi Jinping seeks Taiwan’s de jure absorption or annexation into the People’s Republic of China (PRC), there remain vexing ambiguities and uncertainties about how he is seeking to achieve this goal, how much risk he is willing to accept, and what cost — diplomatic, economic, reputational, military — he is willing to absorb in the pursuit of his objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some analysts argue that Xi represents a clear break with Beijing’s long-standing approach to cross-strait issues, the evidence does not support this conclusion. Xi’s rhetoric on Taiwan is largely consistent with that of his predecessors in Beijing. Deng Xiaoping stated in 1983, “We shall complete the unfinished task of reunification left to us by our predecessors,” an early formulation of Xi’s later urging that the Taiwan issue should not “be passed down from generation to the next.” Deng’s immediate successor, Jiang Zemin, declared that “reunification” was China’s “sacred mission.” Hu Jintao oversaw the passage of the 2005 “anti-secession law,” which stipulated — albeit vaguely — the circumstances under which Beijing would use military force to compel “reunification.” The substance of Xi’s approach to cross-strait relations has also been largely consistent with the long-standing admixture of coercive cudgels and attempted economic inducements. Individuals and actors who adhere to Beijing’s “one China principle” are rewarded and favored, while those who push for Taiwan’s expanded autonomy and security are demonized and punished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has changed is the intensity of Beijing’s coercion and intimidation, and the expansion and increasing sophistication of the tool kit it can bring to bear. Where for much of the past 75 years, Chinese leaders were forced to contend with a vastly superior U.S. military, over the last two decades, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has undergone an unprecedented military modernization and buildup. While it may not yet be able to vie with the United States for its ability to project power globally, the capabilities it can now focus on the waters in and around the Taiwan Strait are extraordinary, to say nothing of the investments it is currently making in future capabilities that will further complicate U.S. calculations. Although the PLA is evolving to play a more global role, the core focus of its efforts remains on having the capability to seize Taiwan and repel a counter-invasion coalition led by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Beijing, a credible threat of invasion remains the bedrock of its political deterrence strategy. Without it, Beijing fears that Taiwan would move rapidly toward de facto or de jure independence, expand diplomatic relations with international partners and its role in international institutions, and seek to forge an even stronger security relationship with the United States, Beijing’s chief rival. Ensuring that the PLA’s military threat is seen as credible therefore requires regular demonstrations of power and capability, from military exercises to calculated rhetorical pressure and warnings. Beijing also believes that Taipei and Washington (and increasingly third countries like Japan, Singapore, and the Philippines) must believe that Beijing has more “skin in the game” and is willing to risk more than anyone else to ensure Taiwan’s annexation. Thus, the recent uptick in what the U.S. Department of Defense calls “coercive and risky intercepts” of U.S. and allied aircraft by the PLA is not incidental or accidental but rather essential to a strategy of demonstrating that Beijing will go to war and risk everything to protect “territorial sovereignty.” Added to this military campaign is the significant political, informational, economic, and diplomatic pressure Beijing leverages in an attempt to deter the United States and third countries from strengthening relations with Taipei and, relatedly, convince the Taiwan people that they are isolated and alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet just because Beijing has a better tool kit doesn’t mean it has a better strategy. Indeed, in many ways, Beijing’s cross-strait approach stands at an inflection point. The policy of economic inducement pursued during the Ma Ying-jeou era (2008–2016) collapsed under the weight of domestic political opposition in the form of the Sunflower Movement. China’s continued and widespread use of economic coercion against Taiwan and a growing number of countries further undercuts Beijing’s faith in the efficacy of economic carrots. The full cutoff of relations with Taipei after the 2016 election of Tsai Ing-wen hasn’t yielded a Taiwan population that is more compliant with Beijing or more interested in “reunification.” In fact, the situation is quite the opposite, with polling data showing that fewer and fewer Taiwan people see a future in unification with the PRC. And Beijing’s campaign of repression in Hong Kong and its active support for Russia’s war on Ukraine have only strengthened Taiwan domestic solidarity against rule by Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at unfolding events and dynamics in the Taiwan Strait, the United States faces a quandary. On the one hand, Chinese leaders likely still see a direct military assault on Taiwan, or a blockade of the waters around it, as prohibitively risky. Even while recognizing that events of the past several years have shattered the illusion that geopolitics is foreseeable, or that dictators follow a predictable straight line, in the absence of a significant deterioration in the U.S.-China relationship or some other exogenous change, the prospect of a Chinese invasion or blockade of Taiwan (an act of war under international law) remains low. As it stands, Xi Jinping is more conservative and cautious than his strategic ally, Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But precisely because a direct attack on Taiwan brings unacceptable risk to Beijing, Xi is therefore likely disposed to ramp up coercive actions that seek to demoralize the Taiwan people and, crucially, create scenarios where the U.S. commitment to Taiwan is clearly and publicly tested. Many such efforts will undoubtedly fail on their own terms, instead further galvanizing the Taiwan people and highlighting the importance of Taiwan to the international community. Yet others will undoubtedly succeed. Some will discourage international actors from taking a bolder stance on Taiwan’s security through the use of direct or indirect threats. Other actions will create or leverage domestic divisions within Taiwan. And, consequentially, Beijing will look for space to probe or outright challenge the United States’ long-standing commitment to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are critical steps the United States can take to meet this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the discussion in Washington should be reoriented away from a narrow focus on still unlikely scenarios, like an invasion or blockade, and instead focus on combating the daily campaign of political, economic, diplomatic, and military pressure that Beijing is directing toward Taipei. The more the United States makes the Taiwan issue strictly about invasions, the more hesitant medium and small powers will be to draw closer to Taiwan and support U.S. efforts in the region. Beijing won’t need to invade Taiwan if it can successfully isolate and intimidate the island. U.S. partners and allies should find their own ways to credibly signal to Beijing that it would pay a price (economically, diplomatically, and militarily) for disrupting peace in the Taiwan Strait. Signaling this cost will demand that countries be willing to accept some additional friction with Beijing, but unless and until Xi understands the isolation China would face as a result of aggression, conflict is more, not less, likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also dramatically step up its efforts to bring radical transparency to the PRC’s actions and behavior in the Taiwan Strait and throughout the South China Sea. The Department of Defense has recently taken steps to highlight the PLA’s growing belligerence in the air and at sea, and such efforts should widen to include not just military domains but also the diplomatic, economic, and political space. Beijing operates best in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as the United States works to build Taiwan’s and its own defense capabilities, political rhetoric back in Washington is undermining the perceived credibility of its commitments. The Taiwan issue has exploded in importance over the past several years, with policymakers in both parties making public statements on a range of related issues. Some of these signal to Beijing that Taiwan’s prosperity and resiliency are supported by a strong bipartisan coalition, and thus, U.S. commitment will continue indefinitely. Yet other comments unintentionally reinforce Xi Jinping’s view that the United States is looking to pare down its global responsibilities, leading to a U.S. resolve that is weakening, wavering, or fundamentally retreating. Clear, consistent, and sensible comments and actions by policymakers and political leaders in support of Taiwan’s security and prosperity would be the best deterrent to future Chinese aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Key to sustaining deterrence in the Indo-Pacific during a period of potential American distraction — by politics at home and wars in Ukraine and the Middle East — is the role of U.S. allies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headlines in early January this year were filled with rumors of corruption and incompetence in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) — but these reports should not serve as an excuse for complacency. In fact, China’s military modernization continues to accelerate, and Xi’s purge of PLA leaders is an indication of the strength of his determination to pursue it. Around the region, Beijing is increasingly aggressive in seeking to coerce its neighbors through a mix of economic, military, and paramilitary tools. The results of the Taiwan election in mid-January will spur Beijing to pressure the new Taiwan government, at a minimum raising the risk of an incident that could easily spiral into conflict. Moreover, China’s maritime coercion in the South and East China Seas shows no signs of diminishing; indeed, there are indications China is planning a 365-day Coast Guard presence in the waters around the Senkaku Islands in 2024. Beijing’s cooperation with Moscow, and the deepening linkages between North Korea and Russia pose further challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key to sustaining deterrence in the Indo-Pacific during a period of potential American distraction — by politics at home and wars in Ukraine and the Middle East — is the role of U.S. allies. As 2024 begins, the picture here is good, but it’s critical to sustain the momentum. The last few years have witnessed a remarkable, and nearly simultaneous, strengthening of U.S. alliances across the region — for the first time in decades. This is a foundation to build upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strengthening is nevertheless fragile, and in some cases easily reversed. Although presidential election years are often resistant to major new alliance initiatives — as allies hedge, seeking to gauge the likelihood of continuity in a new administration — important progress remains possible, and it’s critical to sustain momentum even as November 2024 approaches. Washington should focus on a few concrete steps in its bilateral alliances while sustaining work to build a minilateral security architecture, centered on the U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea and U.S.-Japan-Australia trilateral groupings. U.S. allies themselves have a key role to play in this consolidation — by demonstrating their own commitment to follow-through and investments at home, they can underscore the importance of continuity in U.S. policy and reinforce deterrence against the rapidly growing challenge from China, while at the same time helping to inoculate themselves from criticism in the United States related to burden sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The United States and Japan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Japan alliance enters 2024 on exceptionally firm footing, and this year will bring multiple opportunities to showcase its strength — including a state visit to Washington by Japan’s prime minister this spring and a “2+2” meeting later in year. Japan is entering the second year of a historic defense buildup and so far is moving quickly on key elements of implementation — including the acquisition of long-range “counterstrike” capabilities, establishment of a new joint operational headquarters, and major investments in enhanced readiness for the Self-Defense Force. These moves complement U.S. moves to reinforce deterrence in the western Pacific through force posture enhancements, including formally establishing a Marine Littoral Regiment on Okinawa in November 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year the focus for Washington and Tokyo should be on solidifying these announcements with concrete steps to build a more integrated and operational alliance — steps that will move the relationship in the direction of a more operationally ready alliance and enhance its credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Washington and Tokyo should announce plans to modernize the command structure of the alliance. Washington should begin taking steps to transform U.S. Forces Japan into a truly joint operational command, subordinate to the United States Indo-Pacific Command, to serve as the day-to-day counterpart for Japan’s new permanent joint operational headquarters. The two sides should explore opportunities for co-location of command personnel, perhaps by embedding U.S. liaison officers at Japan’s new headquarters. For its part, Tokyo should prioritize new efforts to strengthen information security and to enhance Japan’s cybersecurity, to include authorizing active cyber defense capabilities. New legislation in these areas is critical to enabling deeper U.S.-Japan operational cooperation and should not be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The United States and Australia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Australian alliance is in remarkably strong condition, having advanced the diplomatic, defense, economic, and climate and clean energy agendas this past year. Washington and Canberra have aligned their diplomatic agendas across the Pacific Islands, taken substantive steps forward toward realizing AUKUS and readying a U.S. rotational submarine presence in western Australia by 2027, broken down barriers to collaborating on advanced technologies, begun building the infrastructure necessary to support more robust force posture in northern Australia, and created mechanisms for increasing cooperation on critical minerals and clean energy. Ambition, then, is not the challenge for the U.S.-Australian alliance. In a year likely to see disruption around the region, and much political churn inside of both Australia and the United States, moving projects into the execution stage will prove key to locking in U.S.-Australian cooperation in and beyond 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, as Australia and the United States scale up force posture initiatives, Washington and Canberra should determine which coordination mechanisms best allow them to set appropriate defense guidelines and build out joint infrastructure. While the priority should be ensuring the readiness of Submarine Rotational Force–West (SRF-West) to host increased numbers of U.S. submarines and U.S. military personnel by 2027, a larger coordination mechanism would aid in the support of increasing numbers of American personnel operating out of an expanding number of Australian bases. The United States and Australia should also increase their ability to produce more capabilities and more munitions, specifically by making further progress on AUKUS Pillar Two initiatives, advancing legislative and regulatory guidelines supportive of lowering barriers to collaboration, and supporting Australian efforts to start producing a greater number and more varied types of munitions by its Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise (GWEO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reinforcing-minilateralism&quot;&gt;Reinforcing Minilateralism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few years have witnessed a proliferation of minilateral groupings, but two in particular should be the focus of U.S. policy in 2024: the U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea and U.S.-Japan-Australia groupings. For the former, locking in the gains of Camp David should be a priority through another stand-alone trilateral leaders’ meeting, an expanded military exercise program, and deepening dialogue on economic security. Japan and South Korea should take steps to fully normalize their own bilateral defense relationship and announce a framework for cooperation moving forward. For the latter, the three governments should build on Japan’s deployment of F-35 aircraft to Australia to expand trilateral training. A particular opportunity could be defense industrial cooperation; the three countries should define concrete cooperation in developing uncrewed systems. Australia’s Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance effort could also be a platform for trilateral cooperation in manufacturing critical munitions and matériel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sustaining-momentum-in-2024&quot;&gt;Sustaining Momentum in 2024&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other critical steps Washington can take to ensure that deterrence holds in this election year. It should sustain a strong diplomatic calendar in the Indo-Pacific to the degree possible. Presidential travel will be limited, but there should be ample opportunity to host visiting leaders at the White House. Congress should seek opportunities to highlight the increasingly strong bipartisan consensus on China policy and issues in the Indo-Pacific; a joint resolution on the U.S. commitment to allies and partners, and support for a free and open Indo-Pacific, would send a powerful signal of continuity in U.S. policy. A host of other policy efforts related to economic security — including promoting supply chain diversification, strengthening export controls, and advancing cooperation with key allies on advanced and emerging technologies — should remain a major focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. election in November will be an important moment for the Indo-Pacific, but the campaign season need not distract from the focus on sustaining deterrence in this vital part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The greatest variable in this endeavor is time, which Japan cannot afford to waste if it is to keep pace with China’s rapidly advancing capabilities. This necessitates tough decisions to ensure effective implementation of the defense strategy, including avenues for enhancing security cooperation with the United States.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2022, Japan introduced a new national security strategy in response to what it considers the most severe and complex global security environment since the end of World War II. The strategy identifies China as the greatest strategic challenge to the peace and security of Japan, the international community, and the international order based on the rule of law. In response, Japan committed to employ all the tools of statecraft — what it dubbed comprehensive national power — to underwrite stability and prosperity in collaboration with like-minded countries. Foundational to this project is a new national defense strategy and procurement plan to acquire advanced defense capabilities and strengthen deterrence in Northeast Asia. Parallel advances in security cooperation with the United States under the rubric of the U.S.-Japan alliance, the cornerstone of Japanese security policy, constitute an important pillar of the new defense strategy. Japan and the United States should urgently address the operational implications for alliance cooperation to maximize the impact of this ambitious blueprint for enhancing deterrence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a nation on the front lines of the China challenge, Japan has pursued a nuanced approach toward Beijing, balancing elements of competition and cooperation to reflect concerns about China’s strategic ambitions while recognizing a degree of economic interdependence and encouraging stability via diplomatic ties. But in light of China’s rapidly advancing military capabilities and recent pattern of coercive activities in the East China Sea and across the Taiwan Strait, Japan resolved to bolster the deterrence side of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new defense strategy is designed to strengthen Japan’s deterrence posture. The government pledged to increase defense spending 60 percent over five years and approved a record $56 billion defense budget for 2024 to acquire a range of advanced defense capabilities. Examples include so-called counterstrike or long-range precision weapons, such as Tomahawk missiles; investments across the cyber, space, and electromagnetic domains; unmanned systems; and counter-hypersonic capabilities, including plans to jointly develop a Glide Phase Interceptor with the United States. The defense strategy also supports new deployments across the Nansei (“Southwest”) Islands to bolster homeland defense and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, an urgent priority amid heightened concerns about the implications of a Taiwan contingency for Japan’s national security. These investments build on defense policy reforms instituted in 2015 based on a reinterpretation of the war-renouncing clause in Japan’s constitution allowing Japan to activate the right to collective self-defense, or the ability to defend the United States or allies and engage in joint operations outside Japan. In short, Japan seeks to enhance its capacity to deter Chinese aggression and strengthen interoperability with like-minded partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest variable in this endeavor is time, which Japan cannot afford to waste if it is to keep pace with China’s rapidly advancing capabilities. This necessitates tough decisions to ensure effective implementation of the defense strategy, including avenues for enhancing security cooperation with the United States. For example, Japan’s military needs to maximize opportunities for training, including joint exercises with U.S. forces, which will prove critical to defending areas such as the Nansei Islands but are too often constrained by sensitivities in local politics. Command and control structures also merit urgent attention. Japan’s Ministry of Defense will set up a new joint operations command by spring 2025 to expedite internal decisionmaking and coordination with the U.S. military. This has prompted debate about whether the United States Indo-Pacific Command, based in Hawaii, should remain the counterpart for managing bilateral operations in an increasingly complex security environment that requires rapid response capabilities. The two governments could also tackle basic operational challenges such as munitions stockpiles, identified as one of seven priority areas in Japan’s defense strategy and a deficiency for the United States that seemingly favors increased emphasis on the co-production of munitions. Neither government should allow bureaucratic resistance to obstruct attempts at reform in these and other areas that could bolster alliance interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential implementation challenges notwithstanding, Japan has established momentum for strengthening its defense capabilities and sending deterrent signals to China. In August 2023, Taro Aso, former Japanese prime minister and vice president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party or LDP, visited Taiwan and stated in a speech that Japan and its allies and partners should deter China by conveying “the will to fight.” Japan is ambiguous about how it might respond in a Taiwan contingency, with potential options including, but not necessarily limited to, homeland defense, defending sea lanes, or providing non-combat support for U.S. operations. But signaling the will to fight complicates Chinese planning, and that itself constitutes a critical element of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s decision to lean forward on defense is one of the most significant strategic developments in Asia in decades, with the potential to transform its leadership role in the international security order. It is still early days, but the trend line favors a sustained commitment to deterring aggression in partnership with the United States as a foundation for regional stability and future prosperity in the world’s most dynamic region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Another thrust of China’s diplomacy involves playing to lingering mistrust of Western intentions and prescriptions in many capitals across the Global South, emphasizing a sense of shared grievance about the uneven distribution of power and wealth in the international system.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S.-China competition over the future global order makes headlines, middle and smaller powers will play a pivotal role in determining the shape of this order. Many of these countries are members of what some call the “Global South,” a term used to describe middle- and low-income states largely concentrated in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. While many of these states sought power in the mid-twentieth century as members of the Non-Aligned Movement or the “third world,” the Global South has become an increasingly serious player on the world stage in recent years. These countries’ rising profile is reflective of their growing wealth, population, and power and the important role they will play on a widening array of global issues. Yet while the United States and other G7 capitals have embraced a new era of strategic competition and have sharpened their focus on China and, secondarily, Russia as top national security threats, countries of the Global South — which often count China and Russia as like-minded states — are more interested in preserving space for their own economic development and strategic agency. To build its influence, China skillfully plays to these concerns by touting its three-decade history of double-digit economic growth as a model for its partners and by contrasting its own form of unconditional engagement and noninterference in domestic affairs with the conditionality and broad engagement of the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, Beijing has directed substantial financial and diplomatic resources toward building up its influence in and cultivating its image as a member (and leader) of the Global South. The primary thrust of China’s diplomacy has been commercial. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched in 2013, aims to deepen bilateral partnerships and build markets for Chinese goods and services. By one estimate, total BRI transactions summed to around $1 trillion from 2013 to 2022. Beijing frequently frames the BRI as a key pillar of its value proposition to the Global South, a signal of commitment to deliver development opportunities beyond its borders. Beijing has also institutionalized cooperation with many states in the Global South by creating special forums for diplomatic interaction and a wide range of educational and cultural exchange programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many lower-income states cannot afford to pass up an opportunity to deepen trade, aid, and investment ties with the world’s second-largest economy. To build influence in the Global South, China casts itself as a partner in technological upgrading as well as economic development and diversification. Another thrust of China’s diplomacy involves playing to lingering mistrust of Western intentions and prescriptions in many capitals across the Global South, emphasizing a sense of shared grievance about the uneven distribution of power and wealth in the international system. Beijing frequently frames itself as a member of the Global South and a champion for a bigger voice for developing countries in international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s engagement with the Global South advances its interests in at least three ways. For one, many developing countries offer both markets and resources key to China’s infrastructure and export-driven growth model. It is no surprise that much of the initial overseas foreign direct investment (FDI) from China, once Beijing began encouraging state-owned enterprises to invest overseas as part of its “go out” initiative in the early 2000s, was concentrated in resource-rich developing countries. Countries in the Middle East offer valuable partnerships for China as a major oil and gas consumer, and state-backed Chinese firms have invested billions in Africa to mine and refine critical minerals pivotal to leadership in clean energy technologies of the future. As ties with advanced economies sour and China’s growth slows, Beijing has intensified efforts to reorient its global trade position, find new markets for its exports, and ensure the sustainable supply of key raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, Beijing sees countries of the Global South as useful partners in leveraging international institutions to serve and protect China’s core interests. By expanding its network of partners, Beijing aims to grow the number of countries it can count on to support — or at least not criticize or oppose — its positions on sensitive issues such as Taiwan, Xinjiang, and the South China Sea in multilateral venues such as the United Nations and on the bilateral level. Research suggests that Beijing has swayed developing countries to amplify its voice in the UN General Assembly, prevent Taiwan’s meaningful participation in international bodies, and deter criticism of its human rights record. Beijing peddles norms of governance, security, and interstate behavior that serve its interests as protecting the interests of developing countries more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, deepening ties with developing economies allows Beijing to undermine Western efforts to build a global order that advances Western interests at the expense of China. In recent years, Washington and advanced industrial economies from Europe to Asia have adjusted their economic and security policies to address China’s assertive turn abroad and repressive turn at home — a development Xi has framed as “all-around containment, blockade, and suppression by Western countries led by the United States.” Countries of the Global South are central to Beijing’s ambitions to expand its partnership network, or — as Xi put it in June 2021 — “enlarge the circle of friends who understand China.” In his speech at the 2018 Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs, Xi stated that “developing countries are our natural allies in international affairs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, recent developments in Beijing’s engagement with the Global South portend a more targeted, assertive, and normative approach — one more colored by U.S.-China competition than in the past. For one, Xi has signaled the BRI will become smaller and greener (“small but beautiful,” as Xi put it at the initiative’s 2023 forum). Most analysts agree that while its top-line dollar value may fall as the country’s willingness to lend has declined, recipient countries are less able to acquire additional debt, and high-profile projects have run into issues, the BRI is not going away. Projects going forward will be smaller but more strategically targeted and more focused on technology and digital infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Beijing has stepped up efforts to expand its normative influence through a range of global initiatives largely aimed at the Global South, including the Global Development Initiative (GDI, introduced September 2021), Global Security Initiative (GSI, introduced April 2022), and Global Civilizational Initiative (GCI, introduced March 2023). Through these initiatives, which largely repackage existing Chinese foreign policy rhetoric under sleek banners, Beijing seeks to advance its image as a provider of global solutions that attend to common needs and priorities within the Global South — at a time when retreats from globalization and rising geopolitical competition throw development trajectories for many of these states into jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Beijing is seeking to temper U.S. global influence by expanding the membership and interoperability of the multilateral groupings in which it holds a central role. For several years, Beijing has pushed for the enlargement of BRICS, which recently welcomed Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Iran, and Ethiopia to its ranks. Saudi Arabia also recently joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a move discussed during Xi’s state visit to the kingdom in December 2022. These groups offer platforms for Chinese leaders to interact directly with partners from the Global South, as occurred during the BRICS summit in September, and they are seen as critical counterweights to tightening ties between the world’s most advanced economies, diluting U.S. global influence. Beijing appears committed to continuing to expand such arrangements in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;At the moment, the United States is playing from behind in the Global South. Given the uneven terms of the competition, it must pursue an overhaul of its tool kit and approach.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a problem in the Global South: China does not follow traditional rules of development, commercial diplomacy, or debt diplomacy. Compounding the problem is the lack of a positive, forward-looking U.S. agenda that speaks to the hopes and aspirations of countries in the region that would offer a clear advantage over China in the eyes of these bustling economies. Many of the offers the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) provides are appealing, quickly deployed, and relevant to the interests of partners in the Global South. Conversely, the tool kit the United States set up after World War II for soft power, or economic and cultural influence, needs an update. The U.S. approach today is marked by excessive caution and indecisiveness, which stands to benefit the United States’ greatest competitor by driving developing countries to take their partnerships, allegiances (including UN votes and alliances in the multilateral system), technology standards, and commercial ties to China and like-minded countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s lack of standards and rules has created an uneven playing field, allowing the country to take actions it could not imagine a decade ago: it can develop Covid-19 vaccines, offer price- and quality-competitive tech solutions through Huawei, and build roads and provide power through the Belt and Road Initiative. As a result, China has become the number one trading partner to more than 100 countries and is often the number one creditor to developing countries. All of these areas and more are the building blocks of a system of rules, commerce, and finance. China and its illiberal partners, including Russia and Iran, would like to create an alternative to the system that the United States has led and built for the past eight decades. The United States and the West need to make changes or they could lose to China and other authoritarian regimes that seek to further their goal of overturning this rules-based system and, in turn, dictating the global geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are a few examples of how the United States should recalibrate its soft power strategy to counter China’s aggressive power grab in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;restructuring-the-aid-approach-for-the-pacific-islands&quot;&gt;Restructuring the Aid Approach for the Pacific Islands&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is not adequately engaging the Pacific Islands — a region the size of Africa with many geostrategic implications. In July 2022, the United States agreed to triple aid for the region to $60 million a year for the next 10 years. In 2023, the White House announced it was working with Congress to commit more than $8 billion to the region. The financing would help with maritime security, climate change issues, and illegal fishing. Still, as the United States has been neglecting the region for decades, the financing is too little, too late. Due to decades of U.S. disengagement, some Pacific Island leaders have pivoted to China, allowing it to fill security and trade voids within the region. China tried to sign a sweeping security and trade deal with 10 nations within the Pacific, though it was unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States urgently needs to do more, including providing more flexibility for government bodies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) or the Department of Defense to tackle grant financing or fund critical infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-a-strategy-for-undersea-cable-networks&quot;&gt;Building a Strategy for Undersea Cable Networks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has not played effectively in building and financing undersea cables — the primary network for voice, data, and internet connectivity — or determining which government agency should take the lead. The United States and China have been waging a soft power underwater cable war as both nations have been fighting for networks and contracts. In 2020 China almost successfully landed a deal with three Pacific nations — Nauru, Kiribati, and Micronesia — to build the East Micronesia Cable, but the plan was eventually upended as Washington warned of security risks. The United States, Australia, and Japan eventually took over the project and agreed to revive it. Although the United States will see more of these challenges, it does not have a complete answer to the war of submarine cable systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cheap-and-high-quality-tech-offering&quot;&gt;Cheap and High-Quality Tech Offering&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the CCP spreads its digital wings across the Global South, the security and artificial intelligence (AI) implications are profound. Huawei, ZTE, and AliPay are the “unholy trinity” of the CCP’s tech backbone for the Global South. They pose serious threats to the democratic world as they create a high risk of unauthorized data collection, which, in turn, leads to major security challenges, including espionage and public opinion meddling. The bad news for the United States is that what China offers is good enough in terms of quality and price. As the United States confronts this challenge, it is not enough to say, “Don’t take the Huawei offer.” Instead, U.S. leaders must enable an alternative coalition of Western countries to provide a competitive price and quality solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-a-mineral-and-mining-strategy&quot;&gt;Building a Mineral and Mining Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining and minerals will be the “new oil” under a carbon transition. At the same time, the United States and the West are not going to move from partial dependence on a series of countries that control large amounts of oil and gas to dependence on China, which controls the majority of mines and mineral processing globally. Many of the world’s minerals are located in the Global South: for example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo accounts for around 70 percent of the world’s cobalt, and Indonesia has close to 40 percent of the world’s nickel. Importantly, critical minerals are almost completely processed in China, and the supply chains are heavily concentrated in China as well. Meanwhile, China is making investments to control 30–40 percent of the global supply of rare earth element production. All of this significantly complicates the West’s efforts in its energy transition from hydrocarbons and its ability to exert geopolitical influence in this realm as these minerals are critical for the production of electric vehicles and other green energy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;removing-bureaucratic-barriers-to-success&quot;&gt;Removing Bureaucratic Barriers to Success&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building lasting partnerships in the Global South demands a positive, forward-looking agenda that adjusts the U.S. way of operating in the region to meet the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good start is for the United States to streamline its bureaucracy to a decisive strategy and remove any red tape. The petty bureaucratic infighting adds to the indecision and costs time. China knows this and uses internal U.S. tensions as an effective weapon. The United States should not be doing business as usual with China, and this means it does not have the luxury of time. Instead, the United States should be on a war footing: the CCP clearly understands this, so why doesn’t the United States?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also needs to provide “one-stop shopping” by clearly marketing to countries in the Global South a palette of services free of bureaucratic formalities. Perhaps a way to unclog this financing is for the U.S. government to remove interagency barriers and streamline interagency work so that, for example, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, USAID, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency all work in a more unified way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the United States is playing from behind in the Global South. Given the uneven terms of the competition, it must pursue an overhaul of its tool kit and approach. The steps outlined here should be at the forefront of U.S. and Western strategy for enhancing competitiveness in a region that will be a primary factor for prosperity and security in the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, Russia has stepped up its disinformation campaigns to erode trust in arms control across the nuclear, chemical, and biological domains. The new era of rapidly disseminated disinformation poses significant challenges to U.S. national security and, more specifically, to arms control verification and compliance. In this polluted information environment, offense is king. This paper examines how the Douma chemical weapons attack eroded the Chemical Weapons Convention, how Russian disinformation about fake Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories undermined trust in the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), and how Russian disinformation campaigns influenced the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. In each of these cases, Russia used diverse tactics and messaging methods — including social media, news media, and diplomatic channels — to spread false information and create political pressures. These campaigns matter for future U.S. arms control efforts because arms control agreements are inherently political tools susceptible to being undermined by political pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian disinformation campaigns have served as a low-cost tactic for Moscow to spread confusion and distrust in the United States and other Western democracies. While these disinformation campaigns have proven effective, they are often rather crudely constructed. Russia often spreads myriad narratives to see which falsehoods stick, an approach Christopher Paul and Miriam Matthews at RAND have dubbed the “firehose of falsehood.” In the three disinformation campaigns discussed here, the spread of Russian propaganda was aided by friendly countries such as China, Syria, and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easier to spread significant amounts of mis- and disinformation than it is to try to counter false information. This challenge is particularly difficult for the U.S. government because public trust in large institutions has declined nearly everywhere across the board, including in large news media. Americans’ public trust in government has hovered below 20 percent for the past 12 years. This contested information environment has largely lacked a credible verifier of last resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is easier to spread significant amounts of mis- and disinformation than it is to try to counter false information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to accurately assess causality and the impact that disinformation campaigns have, particularly in arms control. Disinformation that goes viral or reaches many people does not necessarily mean there will be tangible ramifications or changes in policy. In each of the three following case studies, Russia’s goals, tactics, and audience changed. Nevertheless, as the U.S. security policy community shifts toward viewing the world as multipolar and dominated by rivalry among three near-peer adversaries, further Russian disinformation will shape the contours of geopolitical competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-studies&quot;&gt;Case Studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;douma-and-social-media-subterfuge&quot;&gt;Douma and Social Media Subterfuge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 7, 2018, the Syrian military conducted two chemical weapons attacks in Douma, Syria. The first allegedly occurred at approximately 4:00 p.m., with the second at approximately 7:30 p.m. In both attacks, a gas cylinder was dropped into residential areas, one hitting the roof terrace in a residential neighborhood and the second crashing into an apartment, and reports of the smell of chlorine immediately followed impact. While the exact number of deaths is debated, the bombings killed between 40 and 70 people, with hundreds more treated for chemical-related injuries. Initial media coverage and victim reports included conflicting information on what chemical was in the cylinders — chlorine, sarin, or a mix of both — but the final report from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) only found evidence of chlorine at the sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the attack, Israel launched an airstrike on a Syrian air base on April 9, 2018. The United States, United Kingdom, and France also responded with a joint strike on April 14, 2018, destroying a scientific research facility in Damascus, a chemical weapons storage facility west of Homs, and a chemical weapons equipment storage site and important command post near Homs. In addition, the United Kingdom called for the OPCW to host a special session of the Conference of the States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) regarding the alleged chemical weapons use in Syria and the attempted poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal with a chemical weapons agent in the United Kingdom on June 26–27, 2018. The purpose of the special session was to approve a chemical weapons attribution mechanism under the auspices of the OPCW. Ultimately, 82 members voted to establish this investigation and identification team, and 24 (including Russia, China, and Syria) voted against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately following the use of chemical weapons in Douma, a widespread disinformation campaign was launched to deny the occurrence of the attack. This large-scale, persistent disinformation campaign was initially pushed out through official Russian and Syrian Twitter accounts and state-backed media outlets. The seemingly state-directed campaign attempted to flood the information zone with conflicting and contradictory theories and narratives about the attacks in Douma. Overall, the initial disinformation campaign had little impact on public discourse, as mainstream media outlets dominated the information space with coverage of the attack and international response. However, disinformation took over the narrative on Douma after these outlets turned to other news in the following weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike mainstream media outlets, the digital platforms spreading disinformation continued to discuss the attacks past the initial week. According to a study by the Atlantic Council, from April 10 to 16, 2018, “six of the ten most-retweeted posts [about Douma] came from Assad supporters, out of a total 487,000 posts,” suggesting that disinformation dominated conversations on the topic. The number of retweets of and interactions with disinformation related to Douma was aided by networks of synthetic actors, such as trolls, bots, and cyborgs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies found that in the wake of the attacks, networks of synthetic actors in Syria, Russia, and Iran were activated to push narratives meant to defame the OPCW and White Helmets (a humanitarian organization that tracks and assists Syrian communities affected by chemical weapons attacks), discredit claims of Syrian chemical weapons use, suggest jihadists were responsible for the attacks, hint at nuclear escalation in response to Western retaliatory strikes, and “prey on Western religious and cultural sympathies.” This initial disinformation push also coincided with efforts to delay access to the sites by the OPCW fact-finding mission, which arrived in Douma on April 14, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One week after the attack, the digital disinformation morphed into a complex and hybridized campaign, linking online activists and propaganda blogs via social media. Counternarratives regarding Douma moved quickly beyond propaganda websites with manipulated journalistic content to spread through a network of online activists and journalists with a track record of opposing “Western interventionist” policies and international institutions. This resulted in a new wave of disinformation in which experts from prominent universities or former military officials further pushed disinformation on Douma, often tying the counternarratives in with other conspiracy theories. Digital disinformation was also promoted by more mainstream influencers — such as actress Susan Sarandon, MIT professor Dr. Theodore Postol, and then–presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard — proving recognizable voices can become enablers of false and misleading narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Douma incident serves as an interesting case study of digital disinformation due to two information “leaks” at the OPCW following the publication of official findings. The OPCW’s final report was published on March 1, 2019, nearly one year after the attack, declaring evidence of the use of chlorine but no evidence of nerve agents. While the report was met with pushback from Syrian and Russian supporters, the results did not gain significant traction in public discourse — that is, until October 2019, when WikiLeaks published unauthorized reports by two “whistleblowers” who disputed the OPCW’s official findings. An independent investigation ensued, concluding the whistleblowers misrepresented their connections to the OPCW and the Douma investigations team and committed a serious, deliberate, and premeditated breach of confidentiality. The OPCW stood by its findings, but the damage was done; declarations of a coverup made their way into mainstream media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian disinformation had an advantage in the Douma case, as it was able to spread quickly by tapping into existing conspiracy theories that further muddied the information space. The interaction of disinformation across social media platforms and personal blogs allowed the disinformation to reach wider audiences — and reach them more quickly than the United States and OPCW could counter the narratives. The OPCW took one year to publish a final report of findings on the attacks in Douma, leaving the information space open to disinformation and manipulation in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigations by nongovernmental organizations played an important role in countering disinformation while the OPCW conducted its investigation. OSINT investigators at Bellingcat were able to use photos and videos on social media to piece together the timeline of the attack, geolocate roughly where the attacks took place, estimate the number of victims, and tentatively determine that the attack was the result of a gas cylinder most likely filled with chlorine gas dropped from a Mi-8 Hip helicopter originating from Dumayr Airbase in Syria. Similarly, on June 24, 2018, two months after the attack, the New York Times published an augmented-reality visual investigation of the Douma attacks using images and videos found on social media. These OSINT publications provided a factual and credible source to which policymakers could point during their attempts to counter disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ukrainian-biolabs-and-the-importance-of-expert-messengers&quot;&gt;Ukrainian Biolabs and the Importance of Expert Messengers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to invading Ukraine, Russia carried out a sustained disinformation campaign to justify military intervention. From October 2021 to December 2022, disinformation claimed that the United States was developing biological weapons in Ukrainian laboratories to use against Russia. During the Ukraine “biolabs” campaign, Moscow leveraged international partnerships with China to spread these accusations. For example, Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov (chief of the Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Protection Troops of the Russian Armed Forces) asserted in March 2022, “We can say with a high probability that one of the goals of the United States and its allies is the creation of bioagents capable to selectively infect various ethnic groups.” The U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s (DTRA) Biological Threat Reduction Program does invest in biological research at several laboratories in Ukraine. However, this research does not develop biological weapons but rather aids in manufacturing medical countermeasures and enhancing biosafety, biosecurity, and biosurveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origins of these Russian allegations began long before the war in Ukraine. However, in the run-up to the war, Russia began recirculating disinformation about fake U.S. biological weapons laboratories. On October 7, 2021, the Russian and Chinese ministers of foreign affairs expressed “serious concerns” about the United States’ “military biological activities” in a joint statement at the UN General Assembly regarding the BWC. On February 4, 2022, Russian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese president Xi Jinping reiterated this stance in a joint statement at the winter Olympic games, emphasizing that “domestic and foreign bioweapons activities by the United States and its allies raise serious concerns and questions for the international community regarding their compliance with the BWC.” Three weeks later, Russia invaded Ukraine and further promoted disinformation about Ukrainian biolabs to justify the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disinformation about alleged U.S. biological weapons laboratories was further spread by American right-wing pundits such as Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, and Alex Jones. In February and March 2022, the hashtag #biolabs trended across Twitter. In the following months, Russia continued its campaign on the international stage. On April 6, Russia hosted an informal session of the UN Security Council to discuss claims of biolabs. On June 29, Russia called for a formal consultative meeting under Article V of the BWC; the formal consultative process opened on August 26 and closed in September but reached no formal conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, DTRA responded by putting together fact sheets and YouTube videos. Meanwhile, Russia and China spread disinformation across a wide variety of platforms, including news media, social media, and international forums. China was willing to propagate Russian rumors of U.S. biological weapons labs but was hesitant to claim explicitly that biological labs in Ukraine justified the Russian invasion. These pieces of disinformation were most successful when they were picked up and spread by U.S. domestic audiences, particularly audiences on the far right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this disinformation campaign, the United States was placed on the defensive and struggled to respond to Russian lies. Washington worked with partners to provide fact sheets and disseminate accurate information about the nature of U.S. labs overseas. However, these fact sheets were not as effective because they were not spread on social media as widely as the disinformation and because many Americans themselves did not believe them. Additionally, since DTRA was the target of the initial Russian disinformation attacks, the agency’s response was less credible due to the lack of third-party validation by actors with large social influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These fact sheets were not as effective because they were not spread on social media as widely as the disinformation and because many Americans themselves did not believe them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diplomacy-and-disinformation-the-intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-treaty&quot;&gt;Diplomacy and Disinformation: The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The INF Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union, and later Russia, entered into force in 1987. The treaty first eliminated existing nuclear and conventional ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs) and ground-launched ballistic missiles with an intermediate range — defined in the treaty as 500–5,500 kilometers (310–3,420 miles) — and prohibited both countries from developing new ones. However, in 2013, Washington began to express concerns to Moscow that the Russian Novator 9M729 (SSC-8) missile violated the INF Treaty. Early in 2014, U.S. officials met with NATO’s Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Committee in Brussels to inform the committee of Russia’s confirmed tests of a GLCM of intermediate range, to which Russia responded that U.S. violations were “a lot more numerous.” In July, the U.S. Department of State’s annual Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments report stated the United States had determined Russia was in violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty. The United States continued to raise concerns over Russian noncompliance throughout 2014 and 2015, including at the 2014 Wales NATO summit, at the 2015 Review Conference for the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), in the Department of State’s 2015 report on arms control compliance, and at a press conference at NATO Allied Command in June 2015. Russia’s response to the allegations was to deflect, stating that the U.S. Aegis Combat System installed in Romania was not in compliance with the treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2016 report in the New York Times cited anonymous U.S. officials who raised concerns that a new Russian program to field GLCMs violated the INF Treaty. As a result, in November 2016 the United States called for a special verification commission — which included representatives from Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine — to address Russia’s alleged noncompliance, though this commission soon stalled. In 2017, although it acknowledged the existence of the SSC-8 GLCM missile, Russia claimed this was not capable of intermediate ranges. At the same time, the North Atlantic Council found the United States to be in compliance with the INF Treaty; the council also identified a Russian “missile system that raises serious concerns” and called on Moscow “to address these concerns. . . and actively engage in a technical dialogue with the United States.” Yet by October 2018, the United States announced intent to unilaterally withdraw from the treaty due to Russia’s noncompliance, giving Moscow a 60-day ultimatum in December 2018 to rectify the issue. NATO’s foreign ministers also formally declared Russia to be in material breach of the INF Treaty. Absent a response, the United States withdrew from the treaty on August 2, 2019, at which point Russia confirmed it was “formally dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this period, Russian diplomats used disinformation to deflect and distort the narrative about the INF Treaty. First, they denied the existence of the SSC-8 missile until the United States publicly released information about the new Russian missile. At that time, Russian officials claimed the missile was INF-compliant and that it was the United States, not Russia, that was avoiding discussing the missile. Russian counternarratives centered on claims that the United States was violating the INF Treaty and was solely responsible for its collapse. The Russian Security Council’s deputy secretary, Alexander Venediktov, alleged that the treaty was “unilaterally terminated by the United States, which wanted to remove any legal obstacles to the development of strike weapons.” Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov also claimed that the United States was no longer a trustworthy arms control partner, stating, “The Americans’ recent actions suggest an idea that they would be glad to wreck the entire system of international treaties, at least in the sphere of strategic stability and arms control.” Russian officials continued to deny accusations of INF noncompliance as late as December 2022. Overall, disinformation was deployed through Russian officials in meetings and through Russian state-backed media outlets, such as Russian news agency TASS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia did not deploy high-tech disinformation tactics regarding its missiles, as it did in the Douma and BWC cases, Russian officials’ public statements and state-backed media articles seemed to aim at providing counternarratives to confuse the public. Additionally, Russia’s noncompliance with the INF Treaty was initially difficult for the United States to prove to allies and partners due to the sensitivity of the arms control verification through national technical means (NTM). Moscow frequently stated that because the United States did not provide proof of the alleged violation, Russia was, in fact, in compliance. A concrete public explanation of the Russian violation was not released by the United States until November 2018, when Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats conducted a press briefing. This delay afforded an offensive advantage to Russia, which was able to use disinformation campaigns to drive the narrative by providing far more details and specifics than the United States and to do so in a succinct way. The United States also struggled to prove its accusations without revealing methods and sources for intelligence gathering. Moreover, the technical nature of the violation — regarding what counts as a “ground-launched” missile — was difficult for the public to understand, enabling Russia to sensationalize reports that the United States was trying to undermine strategic stability. Overall, the INF case shows how disinformation can set the narrative regarding noncompliance in arms control, especially when classified sources are used for verification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These studies point to four important findings. First, offense has the advantage when it comes to disinformation. Russia often pushes dozens of narratives in its campaigns. Once one narrative resonates, Russia doubles down on that message. This means that offensive disinformation campaigns can morph and come from many different angles, whereas U.S. attempts to combat disinformation have required sticking to factual accounting, truth, and going on the defensive. Efforts to counter false narratives with fact sheets or press statements also either fail to receive the significant amounts of public attention that disinformation does or are not viewed as credible and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, across all three case studies, Russian disinformation was most successful when it was picked up and recirculated by domestic U.S. audiences. In the case of Douma, mainstream influencers and experts from prominent universities unknowingly peddled lies about who was behind Syrian chemical weapons attacks. In the biolabs case, Russian disinformation was spread by conservative U.S. media, including Fox News. The implication is that the impacts of Russian disinformation are significantly magnified when narratives are picked up by influential audiences in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, open-source investigations are vital in defending against disinformation. Russian disinformation about Douma was successfully countered in part through the emerging network of OSINT analysts in civil society. The OSINT community used satellite images to verify chemical weapons use and conduct interviews with Syrian victims, greatly discrediting the Russian and Syrian government narrative. While public trust in government and major institutions in the United States is declining, OSINT may help fill a vital role as a verifier of valid information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While public trust in government and major institutions in the United States is declining, OSINT may help fill a vital role as a verifier of valid information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the case studies indicate a series of challenges for the future of arms control negotiations, verification, and compliance. Disinformation creates a polluted information ecosystem that problematizes attempts to prove compliance or noncompliance — and undermines the core principle of transparency by creating false narratives and undermining the authority of the targeted actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the rise in disinformation about arms control institutions and regimes, the United States will need to develop strategies to counter disinformation when it occurs and build overall resilience to disinformation over the longer term. U.S. arms control negotiators, lawyers, inspectors, and policymakers should prioritize ensuring disinformation efforts do not undermine the transparency and confidence-building measures provided by arms control while also enabling effective U.S. verification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Defend forward”&lt;/em&gt; on disinformation. Today, the United States does not have a coherent counter-disinformation strategy in place. Instead, it has adopted a series of ad hoc approaches in response, often leaving it on the back foot. In the future, the United States should adopt a “defend forward” mindset for disinformation, taking a preemptive as opposed to a reactive stance. This includes taking persistent and proactive measures to disrupt or halt malicious disinformation while also focusing on defending critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encourage flexible responses by streamlining declassification.&lt;/em&gt; Disinformation campaigns are much more difficult to counter when the truth is veiled in classification and secrecy. In the case of the INF Treaty, a lack of publicly available information about the nature of Russian violations complicated U.S. assertions. Conversely, U.S. fact sheets responding to Russian biolabs disinformation alleging violations of the BWC empowered fact-based counterarguments. The U.S. government should encourage flexible declassification — in cases where it would not harm national security — to arm the public with intelligence that can be used to counter future disinformation campaigns. Much of the intelligence that the United States collects can be declassified without revealing sources and methods. The Biden administration effectively utilized this tactic in the lead-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by declassifying evidence about Moscow’s plans and cyberattacks in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Create counter-disinformation measures within arms control treaties.&lt;/em&gt; Disinformation will become a more common tool for adversaries to cause confusion on arms control compliance and verification measures. Future arms control agreements, both formal and informal, should include measures to address and counter any disinformation related to the treaty. This could be done as a consultative commission or as part of compliance and verification. Such mechanisms would require states parties to an agreement to raise concerns of disinformation about the treaty within the commission or through outlined channels — and claims made outside of the official mechanism could be considered a violation of compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establish a role for OSINT in the arms control process.&lt;/em&gt; OSINT has played a crucial role in countering disinformation in all three arms control challenges discussed above. The U.S. government should consider how to bolster the capacity of OSINT organizations in this role. Support for OSINT efforts could include more government sponsorship of open-source intelligence collection and public training sessions on how to conduct OSINT and counter disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disinformation campaigns surrounding chemical weapons use in Syria, biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine, and INF Treaty violations have already affected arms control agreements. Russian disinformation campaigns have sought to justify arms control violations and undermine global norms against the use of weapons of mass destruction. These challenges will only be exacerbated by new and emerging technologies. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) such as ChatGPT will enable disinformation campaigns to easily draft hundreds of fictitious narratives to spread on social media; deep fakes of political leaders already have the potential to exacerbate political crises; and decentralized and new forms of social media may become increasingly difficult to regulate, making it more challenging to flag and attribute disinformation. All these emerging and present challenges have serious implications for arms control negotiations and implementation. The time is now to begin thinking about how to defend forward against arms control disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 29, Xi Jinping removed nine top military officials in what is being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/china/sweeping-chinese-military-purge-exposes-weakness-could-widen-2023-12-30/&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; a “purge,” including officials from the Strategic Rocket Forces that oversee China’s nuclear-armed missiles. Subsequent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-06/us-intelligence-shows-flawed-china-missiles-led-xi-jinping-to-purge-military&quot;&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; by Bloomberg indicated the purge was due to “widespread corruption” that has undermined “efforts to modernize the armed forces and raised questions about China’s ability to fight a war,” according to U.S. intelligence. Specifically, Chinese missiles were allegedly filled with water, rather fuel, including many of the missiles in the silo fields recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/us/politics/china-nuclear-weapons.html&quot;&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; by open-source intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption in the Chinese military rightly should raise questions about its ability to achieve military objectives and reach the “great rejuvenation” envisioned by Xi. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS), for example, stated in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://fas.org/publication/dod-prc-silos-water-know/&quot;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt;, “these flaws would compromise missile operations” if true, and raised concerns that government information about China’s arsenal may not be accurate or reliable, comparing it to assessments of “systematically overinflated Soviet capabilities” during the Cold War. An accurate understanding of China’s capabilities and Beijing’s threat to the United States and its allies is obviously essential for policymaking. However, the recent news questioning the reliability of China’s missiles should not change anything about current U.S. nuclear policy. The intent of the silos was always unclear, and if anything, Xi has indicated a clear intent to move forward with making them operational and expanding China’s arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021 open-source analysts at FAS and the Center for Nonproliferation Studies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/us/politics/china-nuclear-weapons.html&quot;&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; at least two new Chinese missile fields with over 100 silos per field. If fully functional and armed with nuclear weapons, these missiles would increase the size of China’s strategic arsenal by orders of magnitude. China currently has an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/premium/2023-03/nuclear-notebook-chinese-nuclear-weapons-2023/&quot;&gt;410 nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;, but the Department of Defense &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/29/2003122279/-1/-1/1/2022-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF&quot;&gt;predicts&lt;/a&gt; this could reach 1,500 by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also continues to produce fissile material through civilian reactors, including a fast breeder reactor currently under construction. At the current rate, it could double its nuclear arsenal, but further expansion would require additional material. The 2023 State Department recent compliance report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/13APR23-FINAL-2023-Treaty-Compliance-Report-UNCLASSIFIED-UNSOURCED.pdf&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that “due to the lack of transparency with regard to their nuclear testing activities, concerns remain about the nature of both China and Russia’s adherence to their respective moratoria.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “unprecedented growth of [China’s] nuclear forces” was a focal point for the 2023 bipartisan Strategic Posture Commission. The commission’s report &lt;a href=&quot;https://armedservices.house.gov/sites/republicans.armedservices.house.gov/files/Strategic-Posture-Committee-Report-Final.pdf&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that China, along with Russia, is attempting to expand its global influence by relying on military tools. As a result, the commission warned China could undermine the existing international order and increase the risk of conflict and nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-potemkin-arsenal&quot;&gt;A Potemkin Arsenal?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News of the purges, corruption in the military, and potential subversion of China’s missiles raises questions about whether or not these concerns are well founded and if China is on track to develop an arsenal rivaling the United States’ both quantitively and qualitatively by 2035, as predicted, or if it is developing a Potemkin arsenal. But whether China’s missiles are full of water or fuel does not change U.S. strategy toward China for at least three reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, when China’s silo fields were first discovered, there was rightful skepticism about whether they were fully operational and what was the intention behind them. Prior to joining the Biden administration as principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy, then-MIT professor Vipin Narang &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/us/politics/china-nuclear-weapons.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, “Just because you build the silos doesn’t mean you have to fill them all with missiles . . . They can move them around.” In a worst-case scenario, the silos could have been intended as a “sponge” in a nuclear exchange. In a best-case scenario, they could have been intended as a bargaining chip for future arms control negotiations with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China has consistently been opaque about the status and intent of its strategic forces. These purges and questions about the functionality of China’s missiles is just another layer of opacity. U.S. policymakers have been forced to operate in a fog of uncertainty about the credibility of China’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/11/06/united-states-china-nuclear-meeting-no-first-use-arms-control/&quot;&gt;no first-use policy&lt;/a&gt;, its strategic intentions towards its neighbors, and the strategic purpose behind its rapidly expanding arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while there may be water in some of China’s missiles now, it cannot be assumed that this will remain the case. Xi’s dramatic response to the corruption indicates he is serious about building up China’s nuclear forces. Rather, this news reinforces the need for improved intelligence and understanding of China’s strategic forces and decisionmaking in Beijing. A recent report by the International State Department Advisory Board, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ISAB-Report-on-Deterrence-in-a-World-of-Nuclear-Multipolarity_Final-Accessible.pdf&quot;&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt;, “the Department of State should better use its resources and insights to help the U.S. government understand how adversaries think and what they value, with a particular emphasis on managing the deterrence relationships with them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;options-for-reducing-nuclear-risks&quot;&gt;Options for Reducing Nuclear Risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Xi’s purge and questions about the state of the Chinese arsenal may not change anything in U.S. strategic planning, they do reinforce the need for cooperative arms control and risk reduction with Beijing. Transparency and arms control traditionally work hand in hand, as states are reluctant to sign up to agreements without having some means of confirming compliance. Additionally, however, transparency can reduce risks of misperception and escalation. Historically, China has consistently rejected efforts at bilateral or trilateral engagement on its nuclear arsenal. In the final year of the Trump administration, for example, China &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/29/trump-china-new-start-nuclear-arms-pact-expiration/&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to engage with the United States and Russia in discussing potential limitations on nuclear warheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Beijing may be softening on its position toward arms control. In November 2023 State Department officials in the Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence, and Stability &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/assistant-secretary-mallory-stewarts-meeting-with-the-peoples-republic-of-chinas-prc-ministry-of-foreign-affairs-director-general-of-arms-control-sun-xiaobo/&quot;&gt;met&lt;/a&gt; with their Chinese counterparts for “candid and in-depth discussion on issues related to arms control and nonproliferation as part of ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication and responsibly manage the U.S.-PRC relationship” prior to the Biden-Xi meeting in San Francisco. And in January this year, China participated in military-to-military &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3641103/pentagon-officials-host-chinese-counterparts-for-high-level-talks/&quot;&gt;dialogues&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in years. The Department of Defense used the opportunity to stress the importance of operational safety in the Indo-Pacific region and freedom of navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these dialogues did not yield any concrete arms control agreements, they have the potential to be a meaningful foundation for future progress. Another potential future forum for progress is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kcl.ac.uk/csss/assets/the-p5-process-opportunities-for-success-in-the-npt-review-conference.pdf&quot;&gt;P5 process&lt;/a&gt;, which China will lead for one year starting in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian war in Ukraine has finally taken on the character of a protracted one, and as is characteristic of any protracted war, degrading the enemy’s will to continue the struggle has become one of the most important goals on which the military and non-military efforts of the Kremlin are focused. The missile attacks on Ukrainian cities over Christmas and New Year, as well as the persistent work of the Russian special services to undermine support for Ukraine in NATO and EU countries –carried out with the help of numerous agents of influence including politicians, journalists and experts in these countries – are both designed to achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, despite already almost two years of devastating conflict, more than 74% of the population are still in favour of continuing the war until the complete liberation of all occupied territories. In the West, however, both public attitudes and the attitudes of ruling elites are showing signs of fatigue, putting at risk the volume of military-technical assistance to Ukraine. The failure of the US government to secure approval from Congress to finance aid to Ukraine for 2024 is an example of the success of Russian efforts, albeit indirect. Clearly, if the level of support for Ukraine in US society remained at the level of an absolute majority, as it was in 2022, refusing to vote for the allocation of aid would be tantamount to political suicide. Yet at the end of 2023, despite the fact that 50% of Republican Party voters still support sending weapons and military equipment to Ukraine, such a refusal has become a political reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the threat of ending or at least reducing the amount of aid to Ukraine will only grow in the future, it is worth assessing the consequences of a complete or even partial victory for Russia. For Ukraine, the consequences are mostly clear. Putin does not hide his genocidal intentions to destroy Ukraine as an independent state and Ukrainians as a separate people. The continuation of the war is necessary to achieve these goals, as it allows not only the physical destruction of those Ukrainians who are ready to offer armed resistance (so-called “demilitarisation” in the terms of the Kremlin’s “special military operation”), but also the creation of conditions incompatible with normal life for millions of civilians – both in the occupied territories and in other areas – forcing them to leave Ukraine and seek refuge in other countries (so-called “denazification”, which is essentially nothing more than ethnic cleansing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the help of the West, Ukraine is currently able to deter Russian aggression along the contact line, inflict significant daily losses on Russian troops, and destroy most of the missiles and drones with which Russia is attacking civilian infrastructure, as well as disable the use of Russian aircraft. Although the threat to the civilian population remains, Ukrainians prefer to stay in their country, and even those who went abroad in the first months of Russia’s aggression are gradually returning to Ukraine. The number of Ukrainian refugees in Europe is gradually decreasing: of the 8 million Ukrainians who fled the war in 2022, only about 4 million remain in Europe. But such a situation is extremely fragile, and depends directly on the provision of aid to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a short-term loss of the Armed Forces of Ukraine’s ability to deter Russian aggression will inevitably upend the current equilibrium. Ukrainians will undoubtedly continue the struggle even in such a scenario, but it will increasingly bear the character of an irregular insurgent war, under the conditions of which it will be practically impossible to keep large territories under Ukrainian control, and even more so to protect the civilian population. It is enough to look at Syria to imagine the nature of such a confrontation. The methodical use of airstrikes and the destruction of cities that resist Russian troops would not leave Ukraine with much of a chance even in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The unwillingness of the US to provide Ukraine with enough weapons to win a war with Russia calls into question the US’s readiness to protect individual NATO countries from Russian aggression&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that if Ukraine loses support from the West, Putin may well achieve his goal of destroying Ukrainians as a people and erasing the largest country from the map of Europe. Despite the obvious tragedy of this situation for Ukraine, the consequences of its defeat for the West and especially for the US as the leader of the free world would be no less catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that the West prefers to consider this war as a bilateral conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Russian leadership perceives and positions it as a one-on-one confrontation with the US and NATO, where Ukraine serves only as a proxy. This perception is widespread not only in Russia itself, but also in other autocratic states and countries across the Global South. Thus, any situation that can be passed off by Russia as a victory – that is, any achievements resulting from its aggression – will be perceived by these countries as a direct defeat of the West and the US in particular. At the same time, such a defeat would be perceived as a military one, where the West – led by the US – did not have sufficient military means to support the operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, even though it did not have to participate with its own troops. This would undoubtedly have a very negative impact on the perception of the US as the world’s leading military power; it would encourage countries such as China, Iran and North Korea to continue their own military expansion; and it would also force the countries of the Global South to seek special relationships with these countries, displacing the US as an international security broker. This would further undermine the US position in the Global South, which is already at its weakest since the end of the Cold War. Not only would this lead to a weakening of the West’s ability to use the military infrastructure of these countries, but it would also limit access to their markets, as well as the ability to obtain strategic materials from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Russian victory in Ukraine is highly likely to destroy NATO, at least in its current form. From its creation, the Alliance was an agreement between the US and Europe, according to which the US undertook to protect Europe from the Soviet threat. In exchange for this, among other things, European countries made their military infrastructure available to the US, undertook to develop their own defence capabilities, and recognised the undisputed military leadership of the US in the event of a war with the USSR. After a brief period of uncertainty regarding NATO’s goals that followed the collapse of the USSR, the main threat to the Alliance once again emanates from Russia. The unwillingness of the US to provide Ukraine with enough weapons to win a war with Russia, where the US is not required to send its own troops, calls into question the US’s readiness to protect individual NATO countries from Russian aggression, where sending US troops would be the only option. Moreover, given the trends in US policy towards abandoning the Eisenhower Doctrine in favour of isolationism, there is a real threat that in the foreseeable future the US government may even reconsider its commitments to providing military aid to European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that without US troops, and especially without the US nuclear umbrella, European countries will not be able to defend themselves in the event of a full-scale war with a nuclear state. Awareness of the high risk of losing US protection may force the leaders of European states to start looking for bilateral security arrangements with Russia or China, either of which may offer to step in as a security broker, as has already happened in the Middle East. Undoubtedly, the withdrawal of the US from Europe – which was and remains the principal goal of first Soviet and now Russian active measures – would be immediately capitalised upon by filling the resultant vacuum with Russian and Chinese influence. For the US, the loss of Europe would be equivalent to losing the status of leader of the free world, and together with the loss of European markets, it would mean the inevitable end of the era of US political, military and economic dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Any attempt to conclude a peace treaty with Russia, according to which Ukraine could survive in some form despite the loss of territory and sovereignty, would just be another Minsk Agreement&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Russian victory in Ukraine would destroy the modern system of global nuclear security, pushing the world into an inevitable period of nuclear war. The destruction of Ukraine, which in 1993 gave up the world’s third-largest arsenal of nuclear weapons after receiving security guarantees from Russia, the US and the UK, would be an absolute argument in favour of the idea that the only means of protection against aggression by nuclear states is the possession of nuclear weapons of one’s own. The combination of Russian conventional aggression with threats to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine, as well as the willingness of other guarantors to sacrifice Ukraine to Russia in order to avoid nuclear escalation, would leave no room for any misreading. More and more non-nuclear countries would seek to acquire their own nuclear weapons. Given the increasing number of countries possessing nuclear arsenals, their practical use in a conflict is only a matter of time. Breaking the taboo on the use of nuclear weapons would create a new reality, the tragic characteristics of which are hard to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there is no alternative to defeating Russia in Ukraine. Any attempt to conclude a peace treaty with Russia, according to which Ukraine could survive in some form despite the loss of territory and sovereignty, would just be another Minsk Agreement – namely, giving Putin the strategic pause necessary to prepare the next phase of aggression. There is no way to force Putin to follow through on such a deal, even if it were made, and no reason to believe that he would voluntarily refrain from carrying out his original plan to destroy Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, defeating Russia in Ukraine remains quite achievable and requires only a review of approaches to supporting Ukraine in this war. In the current confrontation, Russia is at the limit of its capabilities, directing about 30% of its state budget to supporting the war. In 2023, the war cost Russia about $100 billion. Russia will retain the ability to continue the war at this level as long as the prices of gas and oil – the sale of which remains the main source of financing for the Russian budget – remain high. At the same time, the costs of supporting Ukraine on the part of the Western coalition remain lower than the costs for Russia, despite the obvious economic advantage of the West. Moreover, the cost of supporting Ukraine is still less than the cost of the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which the US government estimates cost taxpayers $1.7 trillion. For comparison, the total military aid to Ukraine from the US for the entire duration of the full-scale war has amounted to about $46 billion. Such a situation gives the Russian leadership the impression that the West lacks commitment to achieving a Ukrainian victory and encourages them to continue their aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is believed that an advantage in forces and means of 3 to 1 is necessary for an effective offensive. This rule could also quite easily be applied to the financing of military operations. The only thing needed to win this war is to be ready to send three dollars to support Ukraine for every dollar allocated by Russia. In 2024, Russia will once again spend about $100 billion on the war. The West doesn’t even have to spend its own money to apply the 3 to 1 rule: by a strange coincidence, exactly $300 billion of Russian reserves are now blocked in accounts abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;張劍虹：黎智英認為中國政權隱瞞疫情、欠透明 指示英文版着重反中文章&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wjm3Ktk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（24日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第15日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。WhatsApp 訊息顯示黎因為專欄作家馮睎乾的提議而打算籌辦《蘋果》英文版，並指示張劍虹商量做法。黎在群組中稱，揀選英文作者時只需要集中在《蘋果》的觀點及「黃營」的普遍觀點。張指，由於英文版會揀選一些中文新聞來翻譯，不像中文版般涵蓋較中性和生活化的文章，所以英文版會「會負面啲、極端啲」。黎又在群組中表示，認為英文版應包含更多中國大陸新聞，「疫情肆虐後掀起的反中情緒，這些是美國人最需要看。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹專欄作家馮晞乾提議設英文版-黎遂指示&quot;&gt;張劍虹：專欄作家馮晞乾提議設英文版 黎遂指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹繼續就《蘋果日報》英文版作供。他確認黎智英在2020年5月10日創立一個名為「English news」的 WhatsApp 群組，是群組管理員。黎在群組發送訊息，稱：「今日馮睎乾提議出英譯新聞電子版諗得過，反正現在翻譯網站翻譯成本低而快。」張供稱，黎在訊息中解釋為何有蘋果英文版的構思，是因為專欄作家馮睎乾提議，並且考慮到翻譯成本比以前低了很多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示張發出的訊息：「老闆，重要專題我想是可以做，而不是新聞。如22條、陶輝等。」張解釋，《基本法》第22條是指當時關注若果中聯辦不屬於中央級的機構，已經可以干預香港事務（註：《基本法》第22條規定中央政府所屬各部門、各省、自治區、直轄市均不得干預香港特區自行管理的事務。）；陶輝則是一名警司，當時壹週刊和蘋果日報均有做關於陶輝僭建的「獨家踢爆報導」，張認為上述新聞可以納入英文版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱若外國人想透過支持蘋果來支持香港-蘋果便得救&quot;&gt;黎稱若外國人想透過支持《蘋果》來支持香港 《蘋果》便「得救」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示另一則訊息，由黎於2020年5月10日發送至群組，指示張劍虹商討英文版做法，「若外國人想透過支持我們來支持香港，我們就得救了，越想越覺英文版是我們當下必須做事項。」控方問到黎所指的「支持」是哪一種支持，張指，黎的訊息提及「有了英文版我的期望是，或許有一些關心香港的外國人也訂閱撐我哋。」，顯示黎對英文版的期望，對《蘋果日報》而言，如果是收費訂閱的話，可增加財政收入，同時「亦都是一個政治上嘅保護」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續供稱，他起初建議英文版以 Newsletter 形式推行，即整理報導和專題結集，並傳送給有興趣的讀者。可是經商討後，2020年5月推行的英文版不是 Newsletter 形式，而是在《蘋果》的手機應用程式設立英文版頁面，包含數個部份，分別為新聞、專欄文章、訪問和專題，會每日更新。舊文章會保留數天，而專題和專欄則會保留較久。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱：「請努力量（盡）快推動這事，現在很多美國大媒體要訪問我是想撐我哋，是時候走向美國讀者，讓他們的存在成為我們與美國政治的槓桿，是很大支持柱樑。」張表示不知道為何黎想英文版盡快面世，也不知道為何他提及美國政治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎曾指示mark-simon邀美官員訂閱英文版-惟未能成功&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎曾指示Mark Simon邀美官員訂閱英文版 惟未能成功&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎的訊息：「這些事要做，可以透過很多美國渠道做，不用太急，但我會叫 Mark 先搞好美國方面發放這消息的方法和渠道。我們現在要專注是怎樣做出外國人認同質素的新聞，專題和評論。怎樣去選擇適合外國人有興趣看，已是我們不易做得到的，馬上做好質量才宣傳。」控方並問及 Mark Simon 在籌備英文版中的角色。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指據黎在群組中的訊息及其他訊息，他相信 Mark Simon 負責在外國發放消息的渠道，因上述訊息討論英文版如何宣傳，所以黎吩咐同事不用急，先做好文章質素，之後 Mark Simon 會在美國宣傳。Mark Simon 亦會按照黎的指示，邀請美國政要和官員訂閱英文版。此外，黎曾提及 Mark Simon 會介紹一些英文版專欄作家。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又稱，黎曾叫 Mark Simon 到美國找時任副總統彭斯和時任國務卿蓬佩奧訂閱《蘋果》英文版。控方展示黎傳送給 Mark Simon 的訊息：「Imaging if we can get Mike Pence to subscribe to Apple Daily app! The publicity and respect it command would arouse much support for us. I know it’s almost impossible to pull it off. But can try?」（「試想像若果能使彭斯訂閱蘋果，相關宣傳會為我們帶來很多支持，我知這是幾乎沒可能，但可以一試？」）惟張指，由於彭斯和蓬佩奧作為政治人物，他們的訂閱和付費記錄不能公開，所以最終未有成功叫他們訂閱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;英文版揀選中文新聞翻譯-張劍虹形容更加極端&quot;&gt;英文版揀選中文新聞翻譯 張劍虹形容「更加極端」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示另一則訊息，黎在群組中稱，在揀選英文版寫手時不需要囊括不同的政見給外國人知道，只需要集中在《蘋果》的觀點及「黃營」的普遍觀點。（“When we choose writers we don’t have to think about giving foreigners a balanced view of what happens here of every different colors, we only concentrate in our Apple Daily HK view, a general view of the yellow side.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹解釋，因為黎想讓外國人知道「偏黃」的角度。張又指，黎認為揀選寫手時只需要一些「蘋果觀點」和「支持香港」的觀點，而不需要平衡報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，這是否成為了《蘋果》英文版的政策，即是沒有關於中國的正面新聞，只得負面新聞？張確認。李官聞言指，其實《蘋果》中文版亦採用相同政策。張則回應：「英文版仲更加極端好多囉，可以咁講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問何謂「極端」，張指《蘋果》每日均有很多新聞，有的比較中性和生活化，不一定全部都是負面新聞，但《蘋果》英文版會揀選一些中文新聞來翻譯，因而「會負面啲、極端啲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官續問，就中國而言，黎智英想營造怎樣的形象和帶出怎樣的訊息？張形容：「黎生覺得中國政權係打壓人權，咁喺新冠病毒嘅時候，政權又唔透明呀，隱瞞疫情呀，令到成個疫情擴散至全世界」，所以黎認為要向外國人呈現上述形象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又問，黎是否對中國有一定看法，然後想將他的看法推銷給外國。張則指，黎的確有上述看法，但他在群組中亦重申「反中情緒係美國最需要嘅，所以佢都因為咁樣而提供多啲呢類新聞俾讀者」，從而「想俾美國有多啲理由去做敵對行動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎希望英文版影響美國民意-及成為蘋果政治庇護&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎希望英文版影響美國民意 及成為《蘋果》政治庇護&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹早前提及，黎希望《蘋果》英文版「走向美國」，以及成為美國政治的槓桿。李官要求張簡述「美國政治槓桿」的意思，張指以他的理解，黎想影響美國的民意，「從而令美國嘅政治都產生作用」，即希望美國能出手做敵對行動，可以幫助到香港和《蘋果日報》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示黎智英傳送給前動新聞平台總監張志偉的訊息：「Patreon 的問題是與蘋果日報隔離，我們主要目的是外國人撐蘋果日報，尤其美國政治人物訂閱蘋果對我們的政治庇護更重要，我仍然認為英文版有需要設在我們 app 內。」張劍虹指黎希望英文版能為《蘋果日報》提供一個重大的政治保護。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張疫情後掀反中情緒-黎認為美國人最需要看反中文章&quot;&gt;張：疫情後掀反中情緒 黎認為美國人最需要看反中文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月13日的群組訊息，黎稱：「我越想越覺得英文版應該着重大陸新聞，專題和文章花絮等。在疫情肆虐後掀起的反中情緒，這些是美國人最需要看。」黎又指目標是讓外國人看到《南華早報》上看不到的中國新聞，打破南早的壟斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張解釋，黎認為疫情後掀起反中情緒，所以美國人最需要看到反中文章，最後《蘋果》亦有執行此項編採政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張供稱，其後羅偉光根據黎的指示，於5月13日把揀選文章準則建議書發送至群組。同年5月31日，張志偉發訊息通知群組成員，指英文版蘋果 App page 正式推出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指《蘋果》早於2020年5月25日發表題為「【打國際線】 《蘋果》英文版免費試睇！」文章，宣布英文版面世，要求張澄清《蘋果》英文版確實面世日子。張解釋英文版網站比手機 App 的英文版頁面更早面世，但他已記不起前者確實面世日子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張黎指示加入台灣新聞-冀美國關注中國脅迫台灣&quot;&gt;張：黎指示加入台灣新聞 冀美國關注中國脅迫台灣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月19日黎發送給張的訊息：「劍虹，今次中美對峙台在美國戰略上提升，令美國人關注。你認為在香港英文版下面也加插台灣新聞，專題，評論十篇八篇以搞高吸引？謝謝。」張回覆：「老闆，一定需要的。中美大戰，台灣重要，必須要加的。謝謝」，黎回覆：「好，你來策劃，謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問張為何要加入台灣新聞。張供稱，台灣在中美角力戰略上地位提升，變得重要，因中國在軍事和經濟上對台灣脅迫，使全世界特別是美國很關注，亦會令美國更加同情和支援「呢個已經有民主自由的台灣」，而黎認為若果台灣受到保護的話，商人在台灣投資會更加放心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問張，《蘋果》是否希望為台灣取得更多支持。張表示相信是，亦相信黎想中國脅迫台灣一事得到美國更多關注。李官問是否想將中國置於一個不利位置？張確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，黎發訊息給張，指示他兼任蘋果英文版出版人。張稱他最終沒有成為英文版的出版人，而他負責中文版和英文版《蘋果》的運作，馮偉光則負責揀選新聞來翻譯及統籌英文版作者。不過在架構上，馮偉光是向總編輯羅偉光負責，羅偉光向張志偉負責，張志偉向陳沛敏負責，而陳沛敏則向張劍虹負責。但事實上，如馮有任何問題，很多時會直接聯絡張。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 馮偉光，筆名「盧峯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「English news」群組記錄顯示，馮偉光於2020年6月2日加入群組，張劍虹向群組發送訊息，表示「歡迎主筆」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果手機應用程式於2020年6月在英國上架&quot;&gt;《蘋果》手機應用程式於2020年6月在英國上架&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月1日張志偉發訊息至群組，稱：「各位，有份 DQ 何君堯學位的 Luke de Pulford，在 Twitter 幫我們蘋果英文版宣傳，更說有興趣在我們英文版蘋果寫專欄！」以張劍虹所知，Luke de Pulford 是英國保守黨人權組織的成員，至於他最終有否在《蘋果》撰文，張劍虹則表示沒有留意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，張志偉再向群組發送訊息，通知大家《蘋果》手機應用程式當天在英國上架，英國的讀者可以下載手機應用程式看到《蘋果》英文版，「因英國已脫歐，而其他歐盟國家仍不可以。」張劍虹解釋，由於歐盟國家對於私隱有嚴格規定，手機應用程式不能收集讀者數據，所以他相信除了歐盟成員國之外，其他地方下載《蘋果》手機應用程式也是沒有問題，包括新加坡和美國。張其後補充：「中國⋯⋯我諗應該都唔得。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，張志偉再發送訊息，指將會一連五日逢晚上8時推播（push）《蘋果》文章英文版以作宣傳，又提到：「我們打美國市場，故是香港時間晚上8pm（即美東8pm）出 push。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後張志偉向群組發訊息：「各位，我們蘋果 fb、twitter 和 IG 已出老闆的蘋果英文版宣傳片」，並附上蘋果 Facebook、Twitter、Instagram 和北美蘋果 Facebook 的影片連結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到「北美蘋果」是什麼，張劍虹指「北美蘋果」是一個獨立網站，它將香港和台灣《蘋果》的內容集合在一起，然後在北美地區收取訂閱費用。地區包括美國和加拿大，讀書只要支付月費，便可以閱覽香港和台灣《蘋果》內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英認為live-chat節目好有用-能與有影響力人士談論香港局勢&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英認為Live Chat節目「好有用」 能與有影響力人士談論香港局勢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年6月30日的群組訊息，張志偉稱：「老闆、張生、各位，老闆計劃做的 twitter live，目的是和外國讀者互動，打國際線，我建議以下做法：」，之後列出直播時間、地點、人手和社交媒體等建議。張劍虹其後回覆「是否後天就開始？惡法剛生效」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹解釋，「Twitter Live」是「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」的前身，黎智英想在節目中邀請嘉賓，但張印象中首集節目是沒有嘉賓，僅直播黎演講，若有嘉賓時就直播他們對談。張續指，節目分別在《蘋果》英文版平台、《蘋果》 Twitter 和黎的個人 Twitter 進行直播。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「惡法剛生效」，張指是國安法，又指在當時籌備節目，黎邀請外國知名人士來對談和談論《香港國安法》生效之後的局勢，是希望外國關注香港形勢、提供援助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指 Live Chat 節目的題目由黎決定，而他自己不曾就此參與討論；嘉賓方面，張相信是由黎邀請，因《蘋果》並沒有牽涉邀請嘉賓。張指，約一至兩個月後，他與黎討論這個節目時，「黎生覺得呢啲 Live Chat 好有用，可以同呢啲有影響力嘅人談論香港局勢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問張，為何他在群組中詢問節目開始日子時，會提及《國安法》？張則指「黎生好緊張呢個《國安法》對《蘋果日報》和香港的影響」，因此張想問黎是否想在節目中講述《國安法》和香港的影響。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹指live-chat-節目後期次數較頻密&quot;&gt;張劍虹指Live Chat 節目後期次數較頻密&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2020年7月3日的訊息，張通知群組成員，「蘋果日報北美」的 Facebook 專頁當日正式易名為「Apple Daily - English Edition」，並「會開始出全英文fb po打國際線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問「打國際線」是什麼意思，張回答：「啫係一路以嚟用緊嘅意思。」惟控方並沒有追問下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年7月30日，張志偉向群組發放訊息，指當天 Live Chat 節目的嘉賓是壹傳媒獨立非執行董事 Mark Clifford 和美國在台協會前主席 Raymond Burghardt。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張供稱，起初節目每週播放一次，直至後期11月尾，節目做得較頻密，有時更每週兩次。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方擬播放2020年7月30日的節目片段，片長35分鐘，故申請押後至明日續審，獲法官批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（23日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第14日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他稱《蘋果》製作網上對談節目及推行「撐學生訂閱計劃」，目的均是讓年輕人成為《蘋果》讀者，因「黎生好支持年輕人出嚟抗爭啦，好讚揚佢哋為咗保衛家園而犧牲」。張又指黎的編採指示之一是要提倡「和勇不分」，形容黎「瞓身」支持反送中運動，有時遊行目睹一些勇武示威者破壞店舖，「佢唔覺得係咩一回事⋯⋯覺得年輕人好勇，好投入個運動度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹稱網上對談節目冀吸引年輕觀眾&quot;&gt;張劍虹稱網上對談節目冀吸引年輕觀眾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續就2019年下半年的事件提問。就張劍虹上周五提及的《蘋果》網上對談節目，張指觀眾對象是《蘋果日報》的訂戶，因時下年輕人比較少閱讀實體報紙，卻愈來愈傾向透過網上影片去看新聞，所以《蘋果》便側重製作網上影片，希望吸引多些年輕人透過《蘋果》網站得到反送中資訊，讓他們了解及投入運動。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又提到，黎智英於2019年7月赴美會見官員後，似乎比以前較多談論制裁，例如美國通過《香港民主與自由法案》和禁止供應槍械予香港警方，「咁黎生都認為係好嘅，啫係贊成呢啲法案」，之後補充，「啫係（黎）覺得 Trump 真係做嘢囉，唔係得個講字。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎冀年輕人成為蘋果忠實讀者-推行撐學生訂閱計劃&quot;&gt;張指黎冀年輕人成為蘋果忠實讀者 推行「撐學生訂閱計劃」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另提到《蘋果》推行的「撐學生訂閱計劃」，庭上展示計劃宣傳圖，顯示受助對象是10至22歲就讀本地學校和大專院校的學生，以及「撐學生，抗暴政」字句。張解釋，《蘋果》呼籲讀者捐款，每捐300元，便可贊助一個學生免費閱覽《蘋果》網站新聞一年。張指計劃於2019年8月中推行，因為「黎生好支持年輕人出嚟抗爭啦，好讚揚佢哋為咗保衛家園而犧牲，亦都希望佢哋成為蘋果忠實讀者，就可以繼續睇到蘋果的新聞」，但黎考慮到很多學生均未有信用卡或經濟能力，所以呼籲市民捐錢，讓他們可以瀏覽《蘋果》網站新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英認為和勇需團結抗爭-見勇武示威者破壞店舖唔覺得係咩一回事&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英認為和勇需團結抗爭 見勇武示威者破壞店舖「唔覺得係咩一回事」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指反送中運動期間，每天都有很多新聞發生，加上「黎生都好瞓身、全力支持呢個運動，每一個遊行，黎生都會自己參與，又會行頭，揸埋旗咁樣」，所以整個港聞組都會很投入地去報導反送中運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bDsTG1T.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黎智英&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示4篇《蘋果》報導，包括〈槍彈狂轟港島 百人受傷被捕 瘋狂警暴迎十·一〉（2019年9月30日）、〈蒙面法掀怒火 全城抗爭還拖〉（2019年10月7日）、〈和變勇 「是政權，逼我進化」〉（2019年10月9日）和〈屠龍隊邊緣呼喚 全民勇武／三罷〉（2019年11月15日）。張確認上述報導均符合黎智英的編採指示，即呼籲市民上街、譴責警方使用暴力鎮壓示威者及提倡「和勇不分」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注黎如何理解「和勇不分」，控方遂問到，黎對於「和勇不分」的立場是如何。張指黎認為，「抗爭需要有和同勇嘅人一齊抗爭，係需要團結，個抗爭先會有力量，先會有機會成功，啫係如果分化呢，就會孤立咗一啲激進嘅示威者。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注何謂「激進」，是指思想上的「激進」，還是行動上的「激進」。張則指是行動上的「激進」，又補充：「嗰陣時好興架，啫係出嚟暴動呀、打爛啲舖頭呀⋯⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰打斷，指現時是想了解黎智英的想法，而非張的想法。張回應，據他所知「佢（黎）係咁諗」，「勇係有行動嘅勇，佢（黎）有時去完遊行呀，講返佢喺遊行見到有啲情況，有啲勇武打爛啲舖頭，佢唔覺得係咩一回事⋯⋯覺得年輕人好勇，好投入個運動度。」李運騰追問，在上述報導之中，受訪者可否被黎視為「勇」？張回答可以。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹稱不能拒絕遵從黎指示&quot;&gt;張劍虹稱不能拒絕遵從黎指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問，據張記憶所及，他有否曾經不遵從黎的指示，張稱記憶中沒有。控方又問，他能否拒絕遵從黎的指示？張表示不可以。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，當黎未能如期出席「飯盒會」時，會議可能會改期，或者順延一個星期後才舉行。他又記得黎於2019年10月出門遠行之前，曾特別吩咐他，「如果佢（黎）出門呢，就由我主持」，於是張其後遵照吩咐，每當黎出門遠行時，便由張主持「飯盒會」，事後他會向黎報告會議內容，如果同事有任何意見或問題，張會向黎請示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張黎指示邀請顏純鈎撰寫社論-筆名方圓&quot;&gt;張：黎指示邀請顏純鈎撰寫社論 筆名「方圓」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年4月9日黎與張之間的 WhatsApp 對話，黎稱：「劍虹，你認識顏純釣（鈎）嗎？他文章寫得真好，我想和他見見面。謝謝。黎」，張則稱不認識顏，會託認識顏的人相約。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張解釋，顏純鈎是《蘋果》社論的撰寫人「方圓」真身，由於黎智英認為顏對中共熟悉，所以文章寫得好。張其後經另一名作家李碧華聯絡顏。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示張劍虹與顏純鈎之間的訊息對話，顏表示可以接受每週寫一至三篇，並一度問張：「你就是聞名報界的沙膽虹嗎？」張回覆：「顏先生，見笑見笑。正是小弟。」張亦指每篇社論字數可以500至1,000字，並提議顏先每週固定寫兩篇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，張指筆名「盧峯」的馮偉光和筆名「李平」的楊清奇，均是在黎智英的指示下，負責撰寫《蘋果》社論。張指「李平」主力寫政治及中共為主，而「盧峯」亦主力寫政治，但偶然會寫財經，又指二人的政治立場是「支持民主、自由、人權」，並會批評中國共產黨和「反共」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示兩篇社論例子，包括〈蘋論：反「送中惡法」行動 將無處不在〉（刊於2019年5月13日），由筆名「盧峯」的馮偉光撰寫；以及〈制裁人權惡棍是釜底抽薪 Bring the impact of Magnitsky Human Rights Act into full play〉（刊於2020年6月13日），由筆名「李平」的楊清奇撰寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（23日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第14日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他稱黎替《蘋果》25週年特刊撰文，提到馮睎乾專欄提出開設英文版，黎亦認為：「外國人訂戶越多，政治上或會是種保護」，「越多外國人，政府和政治人物支持我們，越多世界輿論支持和外交關注，我們越能保住法治和自由，外國勢力萬歲！」人大於2020年5月宣布將會實施《港區國安法》，黎隨即指示張推行「一人一信救香港」，呼籲香港人寫信給美國總統、副總統和議員。張指目的是希望「請佢哋出手干預香港呢件事」，例如實施制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英撰文稱外國人訂戶越多政治上或會是種保護-張解釋中共搞蘋果必遭外國制裁&quot;&gt;黎智英撰文稱「外國人訂戶越多，政治上或會是種保護」 張解釋：中共搞蘋果必遭外國制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，張表示2020年正值《蘋果》25週年，當時編採部正籌備一本特刊，並邀請黎智英撰寫一篇感言，放在特刊的最前面。該特刊的內容包括前主管的訪問以及一些圖片，並向公眾發售。控方展示黎智英於2020年5月17日發送給張劍虹的特刊感言草稿，內容包括：「那天看到馮睎乾專欄提出開設英文版之議，我們突然想到：是，外國人要支持香港民主運動，辨法之一是訂閱《蘋果日報》，外國人訂戶越多，政治上或會是種保護。現在中共『打到嚟』了，若是通過廿三條，所有敢言的傳媒關門大吉，境況凶險⋯⋯中共將每個示威，每場抗議都說成是外國勢力⋯⋯將兩百萬香港人說成外國勢力在背後操控的 robots。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問張，文章中提到「外國人訂戶越多，政治上或會是種保護」，當中的「政治保護」是甚麼意思。張解釋：「如果好多人訂閱《蘋果》英文版，中共搞《蘋果》一定會得到外國制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎撰文越多外國人政府和政治人物支持我們我們越能保住法治和自由&quot;&gt;黎撰文：越多外國人，政府和政治人物支持我們，我們越能保住法治和自由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英在文章最後表示：「中共是理直氣壯的。不過他們說謊也理直氣壯的，總之他們永遠是對就是了。對，我們沒有外國勢力，現在卻非外國勢力不可！越多外國人，政府和政治人物支持我們，越多世界輿論支持和外交關注，我們越能保住法治和自由，外國勢力萬歲！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問，上述提到的「外國支持及外國勢力」意指甚麼。張解釋：「講緊外國政治人物、官員訂閱《蘋果日報》」，而他們的支持對《蘋果日報》有「重大嘅政治保護」。張續指：「如果外國政治人物能夠為香港發聲、支持香港，對香港嘅自由同法治好重要，對香港係一種保護。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎指示發動一人一信救香港-促美官員出手干預&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎指示發動「一人一信救香港」 促美官員「出手干預」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月22日黎與張之間的 WhatsApp 訊息，當中黎指示：「劍虹，請考慮蘋果日報發動一人一信救香港。」張庭上解釋，由於當時人大宣布將會在香港實施《國安法》，所以黎打電話給他，吩咐他籌備「一人一信救香港」行動，呼籲香港人寫信給美國總統、副總統和議員，希望他們可以「出聲救救香港」，「請佢哋出手干預香港呢件事」，例如實施制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱，他們最後決定由《蘋果》在網上提供一封信件，讀者只需要在信上簽署，便可以透過 Twitter、Facebook 和電郵等方式傳送至時任美國總統特朗普。張又指《蘋果》分別於3天實體報紙刊登「一人一信」行動，此外亦在網站刊登同樣的信件內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;請願信提及國際壓力-張稱意指制裁和其他敵對行動&quot;&gt;請願信提及國際壓力 張稱意指制裁和其他敵對行動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月24日的《蘋果日報》頭版，當中有一篇英文信件範本，稱中共實施港區國安法意味取消香港高度自治，也會摧毀香港最寶貴的資產即法治，若果沒有國際壓力和美國的支持，香港將會由一個法治社會變成一個根據「北京法治」運行的地方。信件範本下面附有說明，教導讀者可經三種途徑向特朗普表訴求，包括在 Twitter 註冊帳戶，然後發布已簽署的信件圖片，並標註「#TrumpSavesHK」和「@realDonaldTrump」；亦可到《蘋果》網站複製信件，之後到特朗普的 Facebook 專頁留言；以及網上簽署白宮聯署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指請願信提及國際壓力和美國的堅持，問這是指什麼。張回答：「啫係國際上有壓力，採取敵對行動。」控方追問是什麼敵對行動，張則指：「啫係黎生講嘅 sanction 或其他敵對行動。」法官李運騰一度打斷，提醒張作供時要非常小心，只需憶述黎曾說過的說話，但不要自行作出詮釋。張表示黎的確有使用制裁一字，但不記得是用中文還是英文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英自行指示他人處理一人一信&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英自行指示他人處理「一人一信」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到信件範本是由誰人撰寫，張表示不知道，又補充黎自行安排其他同事撰寫及做設計。張指當日黎要出席法庭聆訊，準備申請取回護照，他自己亦有上庭擔任黎的擔保人，因此他整個早上均沒有時間返回公司，結果是黎自己處理「一人一信救香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張其後表示以他所理解，黎後來指示其助手 Mark Simon 撰寫請願信範本，但他並沒有向黎確認，所以未能肯定。張亦不知道 Mark Simon 在「一人一信救香港」中的角色。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向張劍虹展示 WhatsApp 群組「English news」的對話訊息，時段涵蓋2020年5月10日至8月8日。群組成員包括黎智英、張劍虹、前動新聞平台總監張志偉、前副社長陳沛敏、前總編輯羅偉光、前英文版主筆馮偉光、兩岸版的副總編輯蔣美紅和資訊科技部主管 Connie Chan。&lt;/p&gt;

While the two countries enjoy a near-unbreakable bilateral relationship and close political ties, there has been an ongoing intelligence war between the two since the Islamic Revolution in Tehran.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few days have seen global headlines focused on the tit-for-tat airstrikes between Iran and Pakistan. There has been speculation about an Iranian escalation and a wider Middle Eastern conflict that might suck in the Pakistani military. To be clear, no such scenario is on the cards. Iran and Pakistan are already deescalating, with both sides stating a lack of interest in harming their “brotherly ties”. However, a clear violation has been committed by both countries, initiated by Iran, and there is historical bad blood when it comes to the Baluch border, with both sides backing each other’s respective proxies. Friction between the two countries has also been raised by competition for control and influence in Afghanistan, overt Pakistani support for Azerbaijan, and Iran’s recruitment of Shia fighters from Pakistan to fight in the Middle East. While the two have not engaged directly in open conflict in the Middle East, there have been numerous irregular small wars between Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-shahs-steadying-hand-to-support-a-young-pakistani-state&quot;&gt;The Shah’s Steadying Hand to Support a Young Pakistani State&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long before 1979, the Shah of Iran had been one of Pakistan’s foremost backers against a much larger India. Indeed, the Shah even threatened to attack India if it went beyond its remit when it came to attacking East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1971. The Shah along with Jordan and Syria were the only countries in the Islamic world that helped Pakistan with military hardware, intelligence and logistics. All of this is described in some detail in a lucid account by the Shah’s chief courtier, Assadollah Alam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Baluchistan, which has seen numerous insurgencies sponsored by India and Afghanistan, was always a sore point for the Shah. Iranian jets and military helicopters used to be based in Pakistan while hunting Baluch and Afghan insurgents on both sides of the Iran–Pakistan border. The Shah also repeatedly batted for Pakistan, convincing Nixon and Kissinger to go all the way in supporting Pakistan against the Indians in the 1971 war. In fact, Kissinger’s first trip to Pakistan was to study the Baluch insurgency and its impact on US–Persian Gulf security relations. Both Roham Alvandi’s Nixon, Kissinger and the Shah and Alex Vatanka’s Iran and Pakistan go into some detail about the US influence on the Pakistan–Iran joint strategy for security partnerships to protect the Persian Gulf and South Asia from Soviet designs. Baluchistan was central to the security partnership that had endured since 1947, and the Shah was resolute in protecting a young and inexperienced Pakistani state from implosion, especially after the loss of East Pakistan. However, after the ousting of the Shah by Islamic hardliners in 1979, the ebb and flow between Iran and Pakistan began to change for the worse, with an increasing hostility between the two and the convergence over Baluchistan becoming a divergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tehrans-export-of-its-revolution-and-changing-tides&quot;&gt;Tehran’s Export of Its Revolution and Changing Tides&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the early years of the Iranian revolution, the two sides continued to maintain close relations and to cooperate on security issues. Pakistan was pivotal in ending the Iran–Iraq war, with former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani mentioning in his memoirs that along with Syria, Pakistan played a key role as an arbitrator between Tehran and the Saudi-backed coalition led by Saddam Hussein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, ties began to worsen after the Soviets left Afghanistan in 1989, as various proxies in the country began to aim their guns at each other. Iran favoured the Shia-dominated warring parties, while the Saudis and Pakistan backed the Sunnis. Before the emergence of the Taliban, the Iranians had already begun to support Shia groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan to challenge a growing Saudi madrassa movement which had been spawned by the Afghan war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1990s and early 2000s also saw a peak in the power and strength of Saudi-funded groups in Pakistan, culminating in multiple bombings and the targeting of Shia mosques and prominent Shia figures. The Iranian consulate in Peshawar was attacked twice, and a senior diplomat was also kidnapped in the same city in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A clear violation has been committed by both countries, initiated by Iran, and there is historical bad blood when it comes to the Baluch border, with both sides backing each other’s respective proxies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the use of proxies was a two-way street, and Tehran allegedly had a hand in attacking the Saudi consulate in Karachi. The Pakistanis had not been comfortable with the Iranian-Indian alliance in Afghanistan, which was seen as a direct attempt to undermine both Baluchistan and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. Iran’s cooperation with India over the port of Chabahar (bypassing Pakistan) is also seen by Pakistan as a threat to its own port of Gwadar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Pakistani Shia fighters in Syria and Iraq was another red line that  crossed by Iran. This took the competition firmly into the sectarian realm, with the risk that thousands of battle-hardened Shia would return to cause havoc in Pakistan, and has upset the status quo in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2020, Javad Zarif, the then Iranian foreign minister, said that Shia fighters could be used to stabilise Afghanistan and Pakistan. This caused considerable anger in both countries, but showed the Iranian desire to dominate by using proxies to fight local civil wars and to provoke ethnic and sectarian strife. The Saudis have also shown an increasing mistrust of Iranian involvement and influence in domestic Pakistani politics that has bordered on purely sectarian lines. Further evidence of this emerged when one of the former president’s right-hand men confessed to spying on the Pakistani military on behalf of the Iranians, with political cover provided by a party the Saudis had always suspected of being pro-Iranian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-india-factor-and-super-spies&quot;&gt;The India Factor and Super Spies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the new Afghan Republic also pulled closer to India and Iran when it came to trying to isolate Pakistani influence in Afghanistan. In contrast to the Shah’s time when Iran ensured that India kept out of Baluchistan and Afghanistan, Tehran now welcomed India in both Afghanistan and Baluchistan owing to its desire to weaken the Pakistanis’ grip over Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of the Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, captured in Iran by the ISI, has led many in Pakistan to suspect that the Iranians have tolerated Indian spies in sensitive Baluch areas, thereby confirming an Iran–India partnership to trap Pakistan. However, the Indians firmly believed that the ISI had used its own Baluch agents to capture Jadhav deep inside Iranian territory. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made no secret of his desire to raise the temperature in Baluchistan to test Pakistani defences and nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popular film Kandahar, released last year, portrays a four-way battle on the Iran–Afghanistan–Pakistan border between Pakistani, Indian, US and Iranian intelligence agencies to solidify gains in the Afghan endgame. The Great Game for control of Central Asia has now morphed into an all-out battle between regional players in Afghanistan, as opposed to the Russians and the British of the 19th century. India has even moved into Kabul and established friendly relations with the Taliban, in stark contrast to its entrenched enmity with the group in the 1990s. Iran and India have both cornered Pakistan by doing a U-turn on their ties with the Taliban, ensuring that the ISI can no longer use the group against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;geopolitics-trumps-sectarianism&quot;&gt;Geopolitics Trumps Sectarianism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the use of significant sectarian elements by both sides in the pursuit of strategic and tactical intelligence wins, this fight is by and large about power and influence, from Baluchistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan all the way to the Caucasus. Pakistan has closely supported Shia-majority Azerbaijan in its fight against Iranian-backed Armenia. Moreover, Pakistan has had multiple Shia Chiefs of Army Staff and a significant number of Shia generals, and so it is clear that in their military calculus, there is no room for sectarian-influenced decisions. Wajahat S Khan of the Atlantic Council, Pakistan’s foremost defence journalist, also believes that Iran and Pakistan are engaged in extensive geopolitical competition in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Notwithstanding the use of significant sectarian elements by both sides, this fight is by and large about power and influence, from Baluchistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan all the way to the Caucasus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in contrast to an almost war-like situation with the Taliban in the 1990s, Tehran is now heavily embedded in the Taliban’s return to power despite the group’s heavy Sunni tilt, with little or no room for Shia minorities in its leadership. The Iranians began recalibrating their previous animosity towards the Taliban by hosting senior Taliban and Al-Qa’ida leaders who were on the run. A lot of this was done out of necessity in order to balance against the Pakistanis and to widen mistrust between Pakistan and the US during their joint quest for an amicable balance of power in 2021. The killing of the Taliban leader Mullah Mansour in 2016 in a drone strike was viewed with suspicion by the Pakistani military, given that Mansour had just crossed the border from Iran into Pakistan. Pakistan alleged that Iran and the US had colluded in making Pakistan the fall guy once again, when in fact the Taliban were now also being supported fully by Tehran. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, another former Sunni strongman in Afghanistan who was previously a favourite of Pakistan’s, subsequently fled to Iran and became its ally against the US. Iran and Pakistan both used him against each other, with his presence in Kabul after his return during Ashraf Ghani’s government making him a major asset in the ongoing intelligence war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Sahibzada Isfandiyar Pataudi (Retired), a former Director General of the ISI, told me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There has been an intelligence failure in Iran that has caused a disproportionate response and a violent lashing out in all directions – particularly so in Pakistan’s case – which has been immature and unnecessary. I would not put a sectarian twist on it, nor would I suggest a Cold War-type situation. I do believe, however, believe that Pakistan’s measured response shows our resolve to deal with any violation of our sovereignty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries have already restored their diplomatic channels, and their ambassadors will be returning to each other’s capitals very soon. There will not be a further escalation. However, from Karachi to Baluchistan and all the way to the Caucasus, both are waging a covert war for influence and leverage against each other in the modern-day Great Game.&lt;/p&gt;

Given the failure of government reforms, private sector distribution has proven to be a promising solution to improve the operational and financial performance of electricity distribution companies (discoms). This report provides a road map for energy officials looking to introduce private participation in the distribution sector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A June 2022 Reserve Bank of India Bulletin put discom health as a significant financial risk to state finances. States such as Punjab and Rajasthan have a staggering total debt-to-GDP ratio of 51 percent and 39 percent, respectively. Discom debt inhibits the states’ ability to spend on other key areas such as health and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While accruing massive losses, discoms are unable to provide reasonably priced and reliable electricity to meet growing industrial demands. Industrial consumers in India often pay tariffs that are 50 percent higher than residential consumers, due to the provision of cross subsidies, where commercial and industrial (C&amp;amp;I) consumers pay higher tariffs to subsidize residential and agricultural consumers. Prices are also not competitive when compared with other countries — Indian C&amp;amp;I electricity tariffs are respectively 30 percent and 37.5 percent higher than in the United States, when adjusted on a purchasing power basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognizant that welfare redistribution policies (such as the provision of free electricity) and a complex regulatory environment have affected discom health, the government has attempted to reform the sector, but this has had limited impact. Even in 2022, states like Uttar Pradesh had a massive aggregate technical and commercial (AT&amp;amp;C) loss rate of 30 percent. As per the annual ratings of discom performance released by the Power Finance Corporation (PFC), most public sector discoms rank low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As underlined by the consistent high performance of private discoms in India, private sector participation is a promising solution for reforming the distribution space. However, state governments often promise free or low-cost electric power as a political tool — which limits the effective operation of public sector discoms. The political economy considerations during tariff setting often overshadows the actual economics. Given how politicized the electricity sector is, privatization has its challenges. But newer experiments with private electricity distribution continue to improve the model and present new opportunities for states that are otherwise unable to make significant, enduring improvements to their state-owned utilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report proposes a road map for state governments interested in undertaking discom privatization. The authors interviewed various government and private sector officials to identify challenges and opportunities based on their experiences. Discom privatization is also politically sensitive, since there is an underlying belief that it has a negative impact on electoral performance. The authors analyzed election data to test this, finding that contrary to popular belief, privatization has no effect on average voting patterns: the average percentage of incumbents voted out of power remains largely consistent in constituencies with private distribution when compared to the state average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian states have been called “laboratories for reform.” With discom privatization, models are adapting, improving, and succeeding on a range of critical measures, such as reduced AT&amp;amp;C losses and improved billing and collection. These lessons need to be shared and further improved to ensure that every Indian citizen and business has access to reliable, clean, and reasonably priced electric power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s path to a $5 trillion economy will be paved with significant developments in its ability to expand manufacturing and accommodate continued urbanization. Additionally, India’s leadership in climate change mitigation will be important for ensuring a low-carbon future for the world. To promote equitable growth, India will also need to pay attention to social development. India’s power distribution sector is the common thread combining all three of these key priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the power distribution sector is rife with challenges — including political interference, unreliable supply, fiscal mismanagement, and lack of capital expenditure. Despite various government attempts, accumulated discom deficit grew from $45.8 billion in 2016 to $74.4 billion in FY 2022. However, government efforts have led to positive momentum. The total amount that discoms owe to power generation companies has gone down from $12 billion in May 2022 to $2.7 billion in October 2023. Despite progress, there is still a long way to go. Private sector discoms have shown merit and could be part of a state government’s tool kit to bring sustainable reforms to the distribution sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this report, the authors present a road map for state officials interested in pursuing discom privatization. The road map is compiled through interviews with private and government stakeholders and is meant to guide officials at various stages of discom privatization, including the pre-bidding, bidding, and post-bidding phases. Learning from the experiences of stakeholders who have been involved in the privatization process can be beneficial to other state governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is the third-largest electricity producer in the world, producing 1.6 million gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity in 2022. However, this is modest compared to China’s 8.8 million GWh and the United States’ 4.5 million GWh. India’s per capita consumption conveys a more dire scenario. In 2021–2022, India’s per capita consumption of 1,255 kilowatt hours (kWh) was a third of the global average, just 11 percent of the United States’ 11,756 kWh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India ranks low even among peer developing nations. For instance, Brazil’s per capita consumption is 2,524 kWh, South Africa’s per capita consumption is 3,406 kWh, and Mexico’s per capita consumption is 2,110 kWh. Tariffs for commercial and industrial (C&amp;amp;I) users are high — Indian C&amp;amp;I users are charged 30 and 37.5 percent higher tariffs than their counterparts in the United States, when adjusted for purchasing power parity. Industrial consumers also pay 12.5 percent higher than the global average. Transmission and distribution (T&amp;amp;D) losses in India stand at 19.2 percent as of 2022 — four times higher than the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite challenges, India’s generation capacity has grown from 160 GW in 2006 to 425.4 GW as of September 2023, with renewable energy generation being a significant component of this growth. To continue along this pathway, the sector must become more financially viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discom health in the country has been a hindrance to India’s growth story. Rather than providing a much-needed enabling infrastructure, the sector has stressed Indian states’ finances and caused problems for large-scale manufacturing development. A Reserve Bank of India bulletin from June 2022 put discom health as a major financial risk to state finances. Practices such as providing free and low-cost electricity to agricultural consumers are theoretically funded by the cross-subsidization of industrial consumers, thereby increasing the latter’s electricity rates — which sometimes reach as high as 15 times the price of agricultural tariffs. Industrial consumers also pay 12.5 percent higher than the global average, which jumps to a striking 37.5 percent higher when contrasted to consumers in the United States. Despite this, cross-subsidization is a half measure, and most state discoms lose money — reducing fiscal space for capital investments and resulting in intermittent power losses and reduced investment in modernizing generation capacity. Even after multiple rounds of government subsidy and debt restructuring, discoms need to rely on fresh tranches of borrowing from the state and central governments to cover operational and debt servicing expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central government has introduced several initiatives to help state discoms improve operations and commercial performance. These include the Accelerated Power Development &amp;amp; Reforms Programme (APDRP), the Revamped Accelerated Power Development &amp;amp; Reforms Programme (R-APDRP), and the Ujjwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY). The results of these programs have been mixed. A 2019 report from NITI Aayog and CRISIL notes that even as UDAY directed states to assume 75 percent of discom debt, discoms did not improve their operational efficiency substantially. In a 2018 assessment of the UDAY scheme conducted by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), authors further noted that the scheme failed to bring down the AT&amp;amp;C rates or the ACS-ARR gaps to the desired levels. The AT&amp;amp;C rates for state-owned discoms covered under the UDAY scheme have gone down from 26 percent in 2015 to 20.8 percent in 2023. The scheme envisaged to reduce AT&amp;amp;C losses to 15 percent by 2019. Additionally, the ACS-ARR gap in UDAY states has increased from ₹0.54 ($0.0065) in 2015 to ₹1 ($0.012) in 2023. The scheme aimed to bring it down to 0 by 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;discom-privatization&quot;&gt;Discom Privatization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening up the sector to private players has shown merit and should be seriously considered by a larger number of state governments. This report looks at India’s experience with private distribution of electricity, compiling findings from surveys of existing stakeholders to assess the privatization model and provide a road map for states wishing to open their distribution sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant state-level reforms must be viewed through a political lens, as well as through their impact on socioeconomic development. The authors consequently looked at voting trends in the states, cities, and districts that have shifted toward private electricity distribution to scan for patterns that may be related to this reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-are-discoms-important&quot;&gt;Why Are Discoms Important?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to reliable, reasonably priced electric power is critical for India’s national economic development. This is underlined by the stark differences in energy consumption between developed and developing countries. For instance, in 2019, North America’s per capita energy consumption was 5.6 tons of oil equivalent (toe), as opposed to 1.5 toe per capita for the Asia-Pacific region, 1.4 toe per capita for South and Central America, and 1.3 toe per capita for Africa. Consumption of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is 4.1 toe per capita as opposed to non-OECD countries’ 1.6 toe per capita. Additionally, the energy consumption in developed countries is 2.6 times higher than in developing countries. For reference, India’s energy consumption in 2021 was 0.7 toe per capita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6pFQUS3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Regional Energy Consumption per Capita (Tons of oil equivalent).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy consumption and electrification are causally proven to have a direct impact on several economic and social development metrics. Growth is led by an increase in productivity, profitability, job creation, and macroeconomic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, a study published by the University of Mannheim in 2018 ascertained that increased electrification led to industrial growth in Indonesia between 1990 and 2000. Additionally, an extension of grid networks to new locations attracted new firms to that location, thereby stimulating local economies and promoting job growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research from the World Bank shows that electricity outages also reduce the likelihood of a skilled individual gaining employment by 35 to 41 percent and being self-employed by 32 to 47 percent. Evidence also indicates that the increased cost of electricity hurts the profit margins of small and medium-sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electricity access has a direct, positive impact on human development. A study published by the American Economic Association looked at the impact of electrification on employment in South Africa. The study found that electrification leads to the development of microenterprises by releasing women from home production. This leads to higher female employment within five years. A case study conducted in northwestern Madagascar further noted that electrification allows students to complete their schoolwork in the evenings and thereby perform better. This leads to improved educational outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A review of low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) found that household electrification significantly improves health outcomes, as residents can replace biomass fuels for cooking with electricity. A study of 750,000 households in Ecuador that replaced gas with electric stoves found that electric stoves led to a decline in hospitalization due to respiratory illnesses. Given that currently 2.5 billion people do not have access to clean cooking fuels around the world, electrification for cooking can have substantial health and environmental effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;india-overview&quot;&gt;India Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a significant expansion of electricity generation in India, distribution poses significant challenges. Electricity consumption in India has grown threefold since 1991 and is expected to triple again by 2050. Yet, studies from the World Economic Forum (WEF) indicate that per capita electricity consumption in the country remains lower than in Africa. Additionally, estimates show that despite massive gains in the number of households with access to grid electricity, consistent and reliable supply remains a challenge. A research study conducted by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) in 2020 indicated that 76 percent of households in India faced unanticipated power supply interruptions, and up to 66 percent of rural households and 40 percent of urban households faced outages at least once a day. Improving reliable electricity access requires investments aimed at improving the technical capabilities of the distribution network. Therefore, it is crucial to invest in a healthy distribution network to ensure reliable electricity access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improved electricity distribution and access in India would positively affect three areas: industrial growth, renewable energy adoption, and social development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;industrial-growth&quot;&gt;Industrial Growth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy access to reliable, reasonably priced electricity is important for industrialization. The price and access to power for industrial consumers remain a challenge in India, with Indian business consumers paying 50 percent higher tariffs than residential consumers on average due to the practice of cross-subsidization. According to a report by the International Energy Agency, the annual average wholesale electricity prices in India are comparable to those in the United States, despite the stark difference in the size of the economies and the per capita GDP. This hinders the competitiveness of Indian firms, as well as India’s ability to attract international companies to set up manufacturing units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High price, however, is just one piece of the puzzle. Other factors such as outages, low voltage, and lack of access also pose challenges to industrial growth. Research indicates that power outages lead to lower productivity, cost competitiveness, and investment decisions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Given that SMEs form a significant chunk of Indian firms, this has dire impacts. Additional research also indicates that electricity consumption leads to growth in manufacturing in the short run and ultimately leads to GDP growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewable-energy-adoption&quot;&gt;Renewable Energy Adoption&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report from the International Energy Agency titled India Energy Outlook 2021 shows that between 2019 and 2040, India could account for a quarter of global energy demand growth. This, combined with the fact that India’s carbon emissions have grown faster than its energy demand since 2000, underlines the importance of green energy growth. The government has made several reforms to promote renewable energy and has announced a target of adopting 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030, not counting additional generation required for the National Green Hydrogen Mission. India has also announced a commitment to reach “net zero” carbon emissions by 2070. However, renewable energy adoption does not solely rely on installed generation capacity. Reliable storage infrastructure, as well as distribution and transmission mechanisms, are fundamental to the deployment of the renewable energy generated. Renewable energy adoption requires the integration of renewables into the national grid, which in turn can only be achieved through substantial capital investments. Given the poor financial health of discoms, this is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report by the Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) posits that India failing to integrate renewables into the grid could lead to a situation like in Germany — where, despite hefty renewable production investment, the cost of electricity for residents grew and 78 percent of total primary energy demand was still being met by fossil fuels as of 2020. The TERI report underlines three major challenges to grid integration: the seasonal nature of renewables, storage systems, and variability in energy generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the root of it, India’s current infrastructure is not equipped to deal with frequent mismatches between energy supply and demand. Discoms need to be financially viable to be able to adopt better technology, assess demand and supply, and plan power purchases in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;social-development&quot;&gt;Social Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy access and efficient distribution is shown to affect various development parameters in India. For instance, the Economic Survey 2020 released by the Ministry of Finance noted that increased access to electricity positively impacts literacy rates in the country, which in turn increases household GDP. Another report by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Resource Development for 2020–2021 noted that despite a significant increase in household access to electricity, only 56.5 percent of government schools had access. The lack of reliable electricity distribution is a deterrent to access in government schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electricity access is also important for the provision of healthcare services. A systematic review of studies from African countries, Fiji, and India found that electrification has a positive impact on health outcomes in LMICs. The review found that electrification is associated with improvements in antenatal care, vaccination rates, emergency services, and primary health services. Additionally, better refrigeration also leads to improved pharmaceutical supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A World Bank and World Health Organization report from January 2023 notes the importance of electricity access for universal health coverage. Additionally, the report underlines that electricity access is necessary for vaccine storage, provision of pediatric care, and emergency services. A June 2022 report by EY and the SED Fund states that as per the Rural Health Statistics, 26.3 percent of rural sub-centers and 4.8 percent of primary health centers (PHCs) in India do not have access to electricity supply as of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2021 survey conducted by the Council for Environment and Energy Development and the Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation found that 64.5 percent of health sub-centers in Bihar do not have proper access to electric supply. Moreover, 44 percent of health sub-centers suffer from problems with fluctuation, and 55 percent need to rely on backup power (through generator sets) for more than five hours daily. This adversely impacts health outcomes at the facilities. In line with this, a study conducted by the CEEW and Oxfam on the adoption of solar energy for primary healthcare centers in Chhattisgarh indicated that using solar energy significantly improved outcomes by providing health centers uninhibited access to electricity. The study reported that facilities with solar energy treated 50 percent more outpatients monthly and had 50 percent higher deliveries than those without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uninterrupted power supply also has a positive impact on improving irrigation. Currently, several states in India offer free electricity for irrigation. However, the timing of electricity supply is sporadic, and it is dependent on off-peak hour availability. This results in farmers employing flood irrigation techniques, which are both energy- and water-intensive. Studies in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra have shown that using drip irrigation can result in saving 45 percent of the electricity used for agriculture. Drip irrigation, in turn, is most effective with an uninterrupted electricity supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of studies conducted by the Asian Development Bank in August 2020 also stated that improved access to electricity led to marginal improvements in decisionmaking powers and better individual agency for females in a household. Cognizant of the positive socioeconomic impacts of electricity access, the central government launched the “Saubhagya” scheme in 2017, aiming to achieve universal household electrification. As of 2023, over 28 million households have been electrified under the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indias-history-with-electricity-distribution-reform&quot;&gt;India’s History with Electricity Distribution Reform&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government recognizes the importance of a strong electricity sector and discom health for India’s development. Therefore, there have been multiple attempts to reform the sector. These attempts have had mixed success at best (see Appendix 1 for details).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1995, in the face of consistently poor sectoral performance, the Odisha government introduced the Odisha Electricity Reforms Act. The act unbundled the State Electricity Board, aiming to promote corporatization and attract private investment. Soon after, in 1996, a meeting of all state chief ministers was convened. At the meeting, the group released the Common Minimum National Action Plan for Power, which sought to address the lack of transparency in tariff setting. In this context, the 1998 Electricity Regulatory Commission Act was introduced to create the State Electricity Regulatory Commission with the power to set tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poor performance of state power utilities persisted, however, and in response the central government launched the Accelerated Power Development Programme Scheme (APDP) in 2001. Despite the scheme’s momentum, discom performance remained poor, leading to the government intervening and bailing out State Electricity Boards by infusing $7.4 billion. In 2003, the Electricity Act established central as well as state-level regulatory bodies for the rationalization of tariffs and subsidies. The act also introduced the concept of distribution franchising, leading to several states introducing the model. The same year, the government introduced the Accelerated Power Development Reforms Programme to tie subsidy disbursal with reform progress — in vain. This was followed by the Restructured Accelerated Power Development Reforms Program (R-APDP), which focused on urban areas. This also had limited success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Modi took office in May 2014. His government’s first scheme addressing power sector reforms was the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) 2015, which aimed to reduce AT&amp;amp;C losses to 15 percent and the ACS-ARR gap to 0. The scheme had limited success: the AT&amp;amp;C losses did go down but only to 20 percent, and the ACS-ARR gap reduced to ₹0.3 paise by 2019. In 2022, the government launched the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) with a total outlay of $37 billion. The scheme aims to bring down the AT&amp;amp;C losses to 12–15 percent, and it sets a new target for bringing the ACS-ARR gap to 0 by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-status&quot;&gt;Current Status&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite government measures, poor discom performance in India has remained a major hindrance to growth. According to a recent report, over 15 years (through 2021), public discoms in India suffered a cash-basis loss of approximately $120 billion. As noted above, dismal discom performance stresses state finances and affects economic and social development. While there has been some improvement in the past few years, this remains marginal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable reforms brought in by the Modi government include the aforementioned UDAY and RDSS programs and the more recent Late Payment Surcharge Rules. Additionally, the government has introduced the Draft Electricity Amendment Bill, 2022, which seeks to ease the entry of private players in the distribution sector and rationalize energy tariffs to reflect actual incurred costs. The bill has not passed the houses yet. The government has also made several efforts to promote corporate governance through guidelines for management and energy accounting. Dashboards such as Payment Ratification and Analyzing Power Procurement for Bringing Transparency in Invoicing of Generators (PRAAPTI) and UDAY have made data on discom performance accessible for stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has yielded positive yet limited results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current performance of the distribution companies can be assessed through the Annual Integrated Rankings and Ratings of Discoms published by the Power Finance Corporation. The 11th edition of the report highlights discom performance during FY 2022. According to the report, AT&amp;amp;C losses have come down from 25.48 percent in 2012 to 16.5 percent in 2022, and 25 Indian states improved their AT&amp;amp;C rates between 2020 and 2022 (see Appendix 2 for details). Specifically, the AT&amp;amp;C rates for state-owned discoms have gone down from 26 percent in 2015 to 20.8 percent in 2023. Additionally, the ACS-ARR gap has come down from $0.01 per unit in 2012 to $0.0049 per unit in 2022 for all discoms. State-owned discoms have an ACS-ARR gap of $0.012, which is holding steady through 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s total power generation capacity grew from 156 GW in 2010 to 425.4 GW as of September 2023. During this time, the total power deficit went down from -10.1 percent to -0.4 percent. Out of this, 169 GW came from renewable energy sources as of March 2023. Notably, access to electricity in India grew to 97 percent by 2023, comprising 95 percent access for rural households and 99 percent access for urban households, according to the National Family Health Survey 5. In comparison, as of 2018, in the United States and China 100 percent of households have access to electricity; 99.6 percent of households in Brazil have access to electricity; and for neighboring Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, household electrification stands at 76.5 percent and 100 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indias-tryst-with-private-electricity-distribution&quot;&gt;India’s Tryst with Private Electricity Distribution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-1&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 70 power distribution companies in India. Of these, 54 are public sector units and 16 are privately owned and are given private licenses for operations. Additionally, there are eight operational power distribution “franchises” that are technically owned by the public sector units but are operationally run by private sector companies on contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The licensed private distribution companies are spread across eight states and union territories including Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. Out of this, six utilities are run by Tata Power, four utilities are run by Torrent Power, two are run by Reliance Infrastructure, two are run by the RP Sanjiv Goenka group-owned Calcutta Electrical Supply Corporation Limited (CESC), and one each is run by Adani Electricity and India Power Corporation Limited. Pockets in Mumbai and Kolkata have had private sector distribution predating state electricity boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several companies operate distribution utilities on behalf of public sector distribution companies on a contractual basis, as “franchises.” Three states have franchises: Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. There are eight existing franchises, out of which three are run by Torrent Power, four by CESC, and one by Tata Power. Additionally, Torrent Power has applied to get distribution licenses in Nagpur, Pune, and Thane in Maharashtra, whereas CESC has a pending contract to operate the distribution utility in Chandigarh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, private sector companies serve a total of approximately 28 million customers across the country. Out of these, licensed operators serve about 26 million customers, whereas franchised providers serve the remaining 2 million customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Private Distribution Companies with Ongoing Operations.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;history-and-current-status&quot;&gt;History and Current Status&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector distribution is not entirely new for India. India’s first power distribution company, CESC, was established in 1897 as an electric light provider for Kolkata (then Calcutta). The company received a distribution license from the government of West Bengal in 1978.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the real impetus toward privatization came in 1995 through the Odisha Electricity Reforms Act. The act was ushered in due to mounting pressure from the World Bank in the face of consistently poor performance by the State Electricity Board. It initiated the corporatization and unbundling of the public sector utility, ultimately carving the distribution network into four zones that were licensed to two private distribution companies: Applied Energy Services (AES) and Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Limited (BSES).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Odisha’s initial experiment with private discoms was short-lived. Firms reported higher losses after privatization. This was accredited to poor baseline accounting and weak operational data provided by the government. Notably, reform attempts such as curbing electricity theft, reforming agricultural tariff, and managing labor unions were contentious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A catastrophic cyclone in Odisha in 1999 proved to be the final straw in the deteriorating situation of the state’s newly privatized central discoms. The cyclone caused massive infrastructural damage. World Bank funds earmarked for demand-side management and meter acquisition could not be repurposed for construction work. This ultimately led to the exiting of private firms from Odisha by early 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delhi decided to open the door to distribution privatization around the same time. By 2001, Delhi had divided its power distribution into three sectoral zones; two of these zones were awarded to BSES, with the third awarded to Tata Power. In 2003, Reliance Industries increased their 20 percent minority stake in BSES-held utilities to 58 percent to take full control of the company. Delhi decided to introduce privatization through a public-private partnership (PPP) model where the government would retain a minority stake. The three utilities still operate in Delhi and have considerably improved operational and financial efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite positive signs from privatized utilities, electoral considerations stemming from potentially higher power tariffs evoked a lukewarm response from the state governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This changed after the introduction of the Electricity Act, 2003. The Electricity Act paved the way for opening the power distribution sector to private players. Sensitive to the political considerations of state governments, it offered a third way wherein the governments could pass off the operations of running a distribution company to the private sector while still retaining ownership, thereby creating the franchising model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007, when giving a franchise for managing power distribution for Bhiwandi to Torrent Power, Maharashtra became the first state in the country to experiment with the franchise model. Torrent was able to dramatically reduce the AT&amp;amp;C losses in Bhiwandi from 58 percent in 2007 to 22.36 percent in 2014, and this was further reduced to 9.8 percent in 2022. The franchise is still operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odisha’s experiment with franchising started in 2013, when the government gave franchising of five select zones to Shyam Indus, Feedback Energy Distribution Company (FEDCO), and Enzen Global. The experiment, however, was less successful. Since then, 17 other regions have opened power distribution operations to the franchising model. As of April 2023, out of the 23 cases total, 15 had ceased operations; mismatch between government expectations and outcomes, as well as labor unions, have been cited as the cause. States have experimented with different models of franchises such as input-based, investment-based, and input-based with incremental revenue (IBF-IRS); however, experiences have been widely varied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-sector-distribution-performance&quot;&gt;Private Sector Distribution Performance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barring a few exceptions, private sector companies have consistently been able to improve operational efficiency as noted by decreasing AT&amp;amp;C losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list below compiles the AT&amp;amp;C losses of private sector distribution companies. The first year (Y1) is the base year and indicates the losses when the utility was taken over by the private sector distribution company. For comparison, the authors have provided the AT&amp;amp;C losses after five years of the company taking over operations (Y5). In places where applicable, they have also listed the latest data on AT&amp;amp;C losses for FY 2022. Additionally, in relevant cases, the table presents the state average AT&amp;amp;C losses to provide a baseline comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qK2IPHs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3: AT&amp;amp;C Rates of Private Distribution Providers.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, licensed private distribution companies have been able to dramatically reduce AT&amp;amp;C losses. For instance, BSES Yamuna has reduced AT&amp;amp;C losses from 60.6 percent in 2001 to 7.06 percent in 2022. BSES Rajdhani reduced losses from 49.6 percent at the time of takeover in 2001 to 7.7 percent in 2022. The most impressive loss reduction, however, has been led by Tata Power Delhi, which went from 48.1 percent in 2001 to merely 6 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, all franchised operations have also been able to reduce AT&amp;amp;C losses. The most impressive performance was by Torrent Power in their Shil-Mumbra Kalwa franchise in Maharashtra. Over three years of operation, AT&amp;amp;C losses have reduced at an average rate of 17.5 percent per annum. Torrent Power’s Bhiwandi franchise follows closely, as it was able to reduce losses by 9.7 percent per annum over the first five years of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;politics-of-discoms&quot;&gt;Politics of Discoms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India, politics and electricity are deeply intertwined. In the early 1970s, then prime minister Indira Gandhi created a power tariff that provided virtually free electricity to farmers. In the 1977 Andhra Pradesh state elections, Congress introduced flat tariffs and electricity subsidies for farmers. The All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which had just come to power in a highly contested election in Tamil Nadu, followed suit. In 1989, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) — a competing party in Tamil Nadu — promised free electricity to farmers in its election manifesto. After coming to power, the DMK issued an order to provide free electricity for agricultural pumps. This was followed by a series of power subsidies to different categories by both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thereafter, the promise of free or cheap electricity gained momentum as a political platform. With the emergence of the farming classes as a voter bloc in the country, Maharashtra and Punjab soon adopted the strategy, precipitating a nationwide cascade. In 2004, Andhra Pradesh announced free electricity to farmers. Additionally, research from the University of Michigan has shown that electricity is used as a political plank to influence voters in Uttar Pradesh. There was a resurgence of using free electricity as an electoral tool in 2015, when the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) slashed power tariffs by 50 percent for consumers using up to 400 units per month in Delhi. In 2019, electricity was made free for users utilizing up to 200 units per month. AAP swept the 2020 Delhi state election polls. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Bharatiya Janata Party in Haryana used electricity price as a tool to appease voters — prices were slashed in the year leading up to the elections. In 2022, AAP came to power in Punjab on the promise of free electricity up to 300 units per month. Even as recently as 2023, Congress promised free electricity up to 200 units per household in Karnataka. The party won a remarkable majority. Karnataka has now introduced the “Gruha Jyothi” scheme to implement the promise. Congress has promised free electricity in the run-up to the upcoming state elections in Rajasthan in 2023. AAP has also promised free electricity up to 300 units in Chhattisgarh in the lead-up to the 2023 state elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several past experiences such as in Andhra Pradesh and Delhi have shown that if governments increase the price of electricity, they face voter repercussions in the following election. Given that licensed distribution gives private companies more control than the government, distribution privatization becomes politically unfeasible. Even franchised private players attempt to increase collection and billing efficiency, thereby potentially creating a cost for voters when there might have previously existed none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, allowing private players to enter the market has consistently shown to improve the performance of distribution companies. A 2018 survey conducted by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) showed that electricity remains one of the top concerns for rural voters. Similarly, a 2017 survey in Uttar Pradesh indicated that electricity supply was one of the leading political issues during the elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is feasible that improved electric supply has appeal to voters — after all, not facing multiple outages is valuable to residential as well as industrial consumers. Therefore, it is important to explore whether voting behavior is affected by distribution privatization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess whether discom privatization leads to political parties being voted out, the authors looked at all instances where currently operational private companies (both license and franchise operators) were brought in. They then checked whether the incumbent candidate won in their constituencies in the election immediately after the private companies’ entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors calculated the percentage of candidates who did not retain their seats after the introduction of the private companies. Since private companies have a limited geography, the assessment is limited to the “Vidhan Sabha” (state assembly) seats of the concerned areas; the focus is on state rather than national seats since discoms — as well as most electricity sector governance — come under the ambit of state governments. Therefore, their electoral fortunes are assumed to be closely tied with the electricity sector in general and with electricity tariffs specifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove that distribution privatization leads to being elected out of office, the average percentage of candidates being voted out in areas with recent discom privatization should be higher than the state average. Therefore, the total average percentage of incumbents retaining their seats for all states for the specific election cycles was compared with the average percentage of specific areas with private distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors further compiled all their findings from various election cycles, calculated the percentage that an incumbent candidate lost elections, and compared this with the percentage for entire states (party in power is replaced by a contender). Additionally, they ascertained if the findings were different for private licensed distributors as opposed to franchised companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since all the data is qualitative, the assessment relies on indicator variables. A change in incumbents is denoted with “1,” while instances where the incumbents retain power are denoted by “0.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, the report assesses 3,600 data points. This comprises data from 218 Vidhan Sabha elections from constituencies that were served by private distribution companies. Additionally, data from 3,364 state-level elections across six states is analyzed to provide a comparative analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Election results can be affected by multiple factors, and the authors do not claim causality. However, for the initial hypothesis — that privatization leads to incumbents being voted out of power — to be true, it must be proven that areas are more likely to replace the incumbent once a private distribution company enters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report has excluded six utilities that started operations in 2020 or later and therefore do not have instances of pre- and post-election scenarios to compare. The authors have also excluded one utility since it took over the license of a pre-independence utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observations&quot;&gt;Observations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private sector (licensed and franchised):&lt;/strong&gt; Out of all 109 Vidhan Sabha constituencies served by private sector distribution companies, across states and time, 41 saw the incumbent being removed from power after a private distribution company commenced operations — an average of 37.6 percent. For corresponding elections at the state level, the incumbent government was replaced three out of seven times — an average of 42.8 percent. There was a modest positive correlation between distribution reform and electoral success when comparing the constituency and state percentages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private sector (licensed only):&lt;/strong&gt; Out of 73 Vidhan Sabha elections in constituencies served by private sector licensed distribution companies, across states and time, 19 saw the incumbent being removed from power after the private distribution company commenced operations — an average of 26 percent. For corresponding elections at the state level, the incumbent government was replaced one out of four times — an average of 25 percent. There was no significant difference between the constituency and state percentages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private sector (franchised only):&lt;/strong&gt; Out of 36 Vidhan Sabha elections in constituencies served by private sector franchised distribution companies, across states and time, 22 saw the incumbent being removed from power after the private distribution company commenced operations — an average of 61.1 percent. For corresponding elections at the state level, the incumbent government was replaced two out of three times — an average of 66.7 percent. There was no significant difference between the constituency and state percentages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is therefore no notable difference in the percentage of incumbents being voted out of power between state averages and for areas with licensed distribution and franchised distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delhi:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of the 38 elections in constituencies served by private distribution companies, the incumbent was removed from power 9 times — an average of 23.6 percent. The statewide average among all constituencies was 24.2 percent in 2003. There was no considerable difference in the percentages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gujarat:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of the 14 elections in constituencies served by private distribution companies, the incumbent was removed from power 2 times — an average of 14.2 percent. The statewide average among all constituencies was 35 percent in 2012. Incumbent candidates contesting elections from constituencies served by private power distribution companies were re-elected more than the state average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maharashtra:&lt;/strong&gt; In the one election in a constituency served by private distribution companies, the incumbent was removed from power. The statewide average among all constituencies was 63.6 percent in 2009. The authors excluded Adani Power from the calculation since they took over an existing private license, rather than commencing private operations. Given the limited number of elections, the data is inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rajasthan:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of the 27 elections in constituencies served by private distribution companies, the incumbent was removed from power 16 times — an average of 59.2 percent. The statewide average among all constituencies was 60.3 percent in 2018. There was no significant difference in the averages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uttar Pradesh:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of the 9 elections in constituencies served by private distribution companies, the incumbent was removed from power 6 times — an average of 66.7 percent. The statewide average among all constituencies was 69 percent in 1993 and 62 percent in 2012. There was no significant difference in the averages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;West Bengal:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of the 20 elections in constituencies served by private distribution companies, the incumbent was removed from power 7 times — an average of 35 percent. The statewide average among all constituencies was 26 percent in 1982. There was a 9 percent difference in the averages indicating a higher probability of being voted out of power if the candidate was an incumbent when a private distribution utility commenced operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, all in all, in three states (Delhi, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh) it does not seem like switching to a private sector distribution company has any impact on the probability of an incumbent being reelected. In Gujarat, the probability of incumbents being voted out of power after distribution privatization is lower than the state average; in West Bengal, the probability of the incumbent being voted out of power after distribution privatization is higher than the state average. The data from Maharashtra is inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;road-map&quot;&gt;Road Map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite promising performance in improving operational and financial efficiency, private sector companies face persisting challenges in terms of acquiring and operating utilities. While the report has already covered the major challenges vis-à-vis acquisition (i.e., political and electoral), this section looks at the experiences of various stakeholders involved in the privatization process. For a holistic review, the authors interviewed multiple stakeholders representing private sector utilities, government organizations, and independent regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After examining perspectives on the profitability of private companies, this section presents a road map for achieving operational and financial efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-profitability&quot;&gt;On Profitability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials interviewed from private sector companies agreed that it takes between two and six years to turn around a distribution utility company. However, there are some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the time necessary for licensed distribution operators to financially turn around a utility company is less than what is needed for franchised operators. An official from BSES stated that it takes between three to five years to turn around a licensed distribution company, and Mr. Sanjay Banga, president for transmission and distribution of Tata Power, similarly put the number at two to five years. This is supported by Odisha’s example, as the ACS-ARR gap came down from ₹0.6/kWh ($0.0072/kWh) in 2018 (before Tata Power took over) to an average of ₹0.27/kWh ($0.0032/kWh) by 2022. On the other hand, Mr. Rajib Das, former senior official and currently consultant at CESC, stated that it takes between five and six years to turn a franchised utility around. A major reason causing this difference in duration is the licensed companies’ greater participation in tariff setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Mr. Banga stated that in PPP models, where the majority stake is held by the private partner, the partner is obligated to turn the utility around. And third, the share of rural consumers affects the time taken for a private firm to turn the firm around as well. This is because implementing technological changes such as metering can prove more challenging in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;road-map-for-introducing-private-sector-participation-in-the-distribution-sphere&quot;&gt;Road Map for Introducing Private Sector Participation in the Distribution Sphere&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road map is designed to assist government officials looking to introduce private sector players in the state electricity distribution ecosystem. Drawing from interviews with various private sector stakeholders and government officials with experience in discom privatization, the authors have compiled the key areas that should be considered to ensure that privatization is successful. The road map is meant to act as a step-by-step guide for officials. It is broken down into three subsections: planning phase, post-takeover changes, and challenges to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A. Choosing Areas of Operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important for state governments to decide which areas in the state to open to privatization. In Maharashtra and Gujarat, privatizing predominantly industrial areas has meant improved electrical access for firms. This has also protected farmers and rural consumers — both important voter blocs — from increased tariffs. From private companies’ perspective, serving industrial customers can be comparatively easier than serving rural consumers, since the operational costs vis-à-vis collection and billing are lower for industrial consumers. Similarly, as Delhi and Mumbai’s successful experiment with privatization has shown, private companies can perform well in urban areas. However, from the government’s perspective, if the objective is to improve electricity access in rural areas, then privatization should be considered a priority in those zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the licensing model that incentivizes companies to make long-term investments in the served areas can be beneficial for improving electricity access in rural areas. Mr. Gagan Swain, director of finance and corporate affairs at GRIDCO Ltd. Odisha, stated that power distribution in Odisha is operating under a licensee model where 51 percent share is with the private player and the remaining 49 percent is still with the state government. Odisha has been able to provide an average of 23.22 hours of electricity access in rural areas. He added that the Union Ministry of Power is impressed by this feat and that this model can be further explored for other state-owned discoms, which also have rural consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Mr. V.P. Raja, former chairman of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), stated that it will be difficult to find private companies willing to take over rural areas. Private companies would want to retain industrial and urban areas with high-paying consumers. It might thus be fruitful for the government to mandate private companies to take over certain rural areas along with potentially profitable areas. He gave the example of the privatization of the aviation sector in India, wherein the government mandated airlines to take over some loss-making air routes along with profitable routes. Additionally, he added that state governments must assess the consumer mix for an area before deciding whether it should be privatized. An assessment of whether the consumers in an area are industrial, commercial, residential, or agricultural can be made using available district census handbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior official with Adani Power highlighted that for all special economic zones (SEZ), distribution companies can avail a “deemed distribution license” which allows them install alternate distribution infrastructure, thereby ensuring reliable electric supply to industrial consumers. Easing the license procurement process in SEZs allows for greater competition and improved supply. This foresight from the government has certainly helped industrial electricity access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior official from the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) added that it had historically been difficult to get existing utilities to take on the task of building infrastructure from the ground up in SEZs. Therefore, the decision to allow private players was driven by necessity. He added that there has been a renewed interest within the government to develop public-private models, which currently do not have access to electric networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRIDCO’s Mr. Swain added that the size of the geography to be served with reference to the consumer mix under that geographical area should be considered while deciding between licenses or franchises. He gave the example of Rajasthan, where franchising is the prevalent model. He suggested that in places where the operational area is smaller, franchises can operate successfully. However, for larger areas, licensing allows for more holistic development and business ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;B. Choosing Models of Operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevailing opinion among private sector stakeholders is that the licensed distribution model is superior to the franchised model. This is due to private companies’ increased operational, financial, and managerial control in the former. Mr. Banga of Tata Power underlined this by stating that the raison d’être of the franchised model was so that the government could maintain ownership of distribution while leaving the improvement of operations to the private sector. He added that this is reflected by the fact that since franchised operators are contractors, their incentive to invest in operational and capital expenditure is very low. This in turn means that the private players do not make long-term investments in creating assets or improving technology. To this end, Tata Power advocated to the Ministry of Power to modify minimum investment for franchisee models so that companies would not just come in, squeeze existing assets, and leave them in a worse-off state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Das from CESC added that franchises’ disinterest in making capital expenditure investments leads to a situation where franchise companies focus on following government incentives for reducing AT&amp;amp;C. Since reducing transmission and distribution losses requires capital investment, they tend to focus on billing and collection efficiency. He stated that the core of the problem behind franchised companies not making capital expenditure is the tariff model that the companies need to follow. Franchised operators are not included in the tariff setting and are instead “given” a tariff. Therefore, franchised companies cannot pass on expenditure as “passthrough costs,” and consequently minimize it. The official from Adani Power added that since franchise operators are interested in improving billing and collection, they do not focus on network capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another senior official from CESC adds that the sense of “ownership” differs between franchised and licensed operators. He adds that a franchised unit is just a contract, and therefore the private company doesn’t have an incentive to make long-term operational changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;C. Evaluating Existing Performanc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before a private company bids on and takes over a public distribution company, it evaluates the data provided by the company to measure the takeover’s financial feasibility. The companies’ financial projections are based on expected performance stemming from the initial data provided. However, often this data tends to be faulty, thereby putting the companies’ plans at risk. If a company doesn’t have a precise understanding of where it stands, then it becomes difficult for it to ascertain how it should proceed. Mr. Banga added that not having good baseline data also causes frictions with private investors, thereby adding problems for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the experience varies across different states. The official from Adani Power stated that MERC has a very sophisticated and robust system to ensure that companies are undertaking assessment and due diligence prior to acquisition. Mr. Raja stressed the importance of companies conducting independent data collection prior to takeover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior official from GERC stated that it has instituted specific regulations to ensure that the existing company is sharing larger regulatory information pertaining to its utility, once a new player is trying to take over. This allows the new company to have a clear picture of the operations and finances of the utility before they make their final decision vis-à-vis the takeover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;D. Assessing Sociopolitical Factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to assess the sociopolitical factors involved in this debate in order to understand the public sentiment vis-à-vis privatization. Overwhelming negative sentiment can be detrimental to company operations, and private companies have had a mixed experience interacting with labor unions and customers. Torrent Power, for instance, has had various bad experiences dealing with both. In 2012, massive blackouts in Agra precipitated widespread protests and the kidnapping of company employees; in 2013, tariff increases in Bhiwandi caused massive protests. In 2015, Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders accused the company of harassing customers and forced it to shut down one of its offices in the city. The same year, after widespread protests by the Kanpur Electricity Supply Corporation (KESCO) staff, Torrent’s agreement to work in Kanpur was canceled by the Uttar Pradesh government. In 2021, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers vandalized company offices in Bhiwandi, and in 2022, company offices in Agra saw widespread agitation. Adani Power also faced agitation from power sector workers in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official from CESC stated that the company had a negative experience in its attempt to begin operations in Chandigarh due to resistance from existing employees. On the other hand, their transition in Rajasthan was very smooth — which he credited to customers’ previous experience interacting with private power distribution companies. Another source from CESC stated that the company has past experiences where customers have removed smart meters, thereby posting additional costs for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Banga from Tata Power mentioned that the response from customers and labor unions also depends on the reputation of the company. He stated that during Odisha’s first experience with privatization in 1999, the companies faced pushbacks from both labor unions and customers. However, when Tata Power started operations in 2020, there was virtually no pushback. He based this response on the company’s reputation. He added that customers often don’t care about where their electricity comes from if they have reliable supply and good customer service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;E. Contract Negotiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting clear terms of operations between the government and private sector companies is crucial for the healthy operation of the firms. Certain pain points that exist include investment burdens of each party, tariff setting, performance assessment, and government incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Raghav Kanoria, managing director of IPCL, stated that the company’s experience taking over franchised operations in Bihar wasn’t fruitful since there was a misalignment of expectations vis-à-vis investments between the government and the company. Specifically, IPCL expected government support in terms of capital expenditure investments to supplement their own, per their agreement. However, the government did not provide the assured investments. Prior agreement on the repercussions of non-adherence of clauses could hence be beneficial. Mr. Swain stated that deciding which areas each party needs to invest in is also crucial for a good government-company relationship. He stated that there are multiple “social investments” that might not be feasible for the private sector to make unless they are mandatory. Here, the government may consider assisting PPP licensees in some non-remunerative areas. For instance, in Odisha, distribution infrastructure passing through forest areas was causing the electrocution of animals. The government spent roughly ₹600 crores ($70 million) to raise the height of electricity poles, insulate conductors, add spikes on poles, and take other measures to improve animal safety. The government also invested in shifting lines and transformers from the premises of schools and anganwadis for safety purposes. Since this was not a commercially oriented investment, the government did not expect the private sector to undertake it. Other areas that the government has made investments in include rural household electrification, cyclone-resilient infrastructure, and support in the energy transition process. Setting clear expectations on the areas of investments, thus, can inspire confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interactions with regulators are rife with friction caused during tariff setting. Prior discussions can help in managing expectations and ease some friction among stakeholders. The regulators are responsible for setting the energy tariffs that all other stakeholders — such as generators, distribution companies, and transmission companies — must abide by. The official from BSES stated that the Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (ERC) practice of setting tariffs for the entire segment — including generation, transmission, and distribution companies — and not providing a revenue-sharing breakdown for different stakeholders can be problematic. Distribution companies, as the last link in the chain of electricity provision, are at a disadvantage in securing part of the revenue for themselves. Power purchase comprises approximately 80 percent of the total costs. Cross-subsidy charges also tend to be unreasonable. For franchises, this problem gets further aggravated since they do not have any say in this process. In 2022, Torrent Power had pending undisputed claims worth ₹1,344 crores (about $160 million) and disputed claims worth ₹604 crores (about $72 million). On tariff setting, Mr. Banga added that in some cases, well-performing private sector companies are pushed to the verge of poor performance due to government interference. He gives the example of Tata’s Delhi distribution network. He stated that since the chief minister won the elections on the plank of free electricity, he is averse to raising power tariffs. Due to this, the company hasn’t been able to raise the tariffs, despite petitioning for the past eight to nine months. Governments should therefore attempt to address private sector fears over tariff setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are tensions vis-à-vis proper auditing and performance assessment. Mr. Banga mentioned that the center and state regulators emphasize getting data auditing done properly. However, often data recording simply doesn’t exist at the level of various public sector as well as private utilities. Often, companies don’t report the data and regulators don’t ask for it. The lack of proper auditing and assessment is underlined by Mr. Kanoria of IPCL. He stated that despite a contractual obligation, regulators did not seek an independent performance assessment from them and the public sector distribution company, thereby making it impossible for his firm to be able to benchmark their performance and mark it against their initial agreement. The respondent from BSES stated that private discoms are exempted from receiving benefits from government programs and schemes for discom improvement. This means that private sector companies do not receive government-allocated funds for improving the distribution sector. While this is acceptable in principle, Electricity Regulatory Commissions need to consider that this impacts costs and tariffs. The problem is more acute for franchise operators. Mr. Banga stated that whenever new funds come for modernization, discoms do not pass on the funds for areas being served by franchises. The companies wish to spend the money on the areas they directly serve. This is incongruent since, as per the franchise model, the government ultimately owns the utilities being run by the private companies as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Post-takeover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Immediate Changes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A. Initial Assessment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated in the section above, having access to good baseline data is crucial to creating realistic projections about a company’s operational and financial performance. Mr. Rajib Das from CESC underlined the importance of having good baseline data and stated that companies should not only rely on government sources but also undertake a survey themselves soon after taking over the utility. This allows companies to have their own verified baseline data on which to formulate their projections. It could be beneficial for the government to mandate private companies to undertake a baseline data assessment soon after they take over; several regulators already do this. Government incentives such as financial support for the assessment can go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;B. Human Resources and Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to political and employment considerations, most private sector takeovers of distribution companies in India include an employee retention clause. This is done to provide safeguards or employment options for existing government employees, but it can be challenging for a private firm trying to bring in a new institutional culture in the organization. Therefore, it becomes important to set a vision for the company and ensure that all employees — new and old — are in sync with the company agenda. A senior official from CESC noted that even though there is an option for previous employees to stay on at the new company, several choose not to do so. Giving the example of an operation takeover in Maharashtra, he stated that the inability to seek rents once the private companies take over disincentivizes middle- and senior-level managers to remain. On the other hand, in Rajasthan several managers stayed but workers left. The official added that there is a dearth of talented power sector employees in the country, and therefore the company must aim to create a conducive environment to attract this talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official from Adani Power stated that the company took a different approach in Mumbai and retained as much talent as it could. He stated that rather than bringing new employees, the company focused on providing better key performance indicators (KPIs) for existing employees and helping them achieve their productivity. The company only hired new talent in areas where there was no existing capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the company also must ensure that there is no friction between the new management and employees, as well as between the company and government stakeholders. Mr. Banga from Tata Power stated that when the company took over utilities in Odisha, the Odisha Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC) set up a four-member board and made a government secretary its chairman. This allowed better coordination between the government and private stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official from GERC mentioned that the success of a utility ultimately depends on cost recovery. To ensure that companies are maintaining their financial hygiene, GERC has instituted a quarterly mechanism for reviewing retail tariffs. This eases the way for private sector companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;C. Managing Existing Customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is a change in the management of a distribution company from public to private, there can be consumer anxiety over potential tariff increases, or fears about private sector apathy to operational issues. The private companies must address these as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Banga from Tata Power stated that in his experience consumers don’t care whether their electricity is being provided by government or private sector players. They do, however, care about tariffs. Assuring consumers that the private company will not raise tariffs for five years helps assuage these concerns. In the meantime, the private company gets an opportunity to improve the supply. Consumers also get accustomed to improved delivery, and hence they have a propensity to accept higher tariffs. He added that Tata’s brand image as a trusted 100-year-old firm does certainly help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to ensure that customer anxieties are being addressed is through opening call centers and advertising them heavily. An official from CESC stated that this is a low-cost, high-visibility measure. Torrent Power launched its fully digitalized trademark “Plugpoint” call centers since 2016. Adani Power has been able to improve customer service by leveraging two technologies. First, they have introduced an AI chatbot, which can help customers with basic services. Second, they also developed a video contact center, through which concerned customers can speak to an agent over video call. Speaking to a person helps assuage customer anxieties. On the other hand, the customer agent has access to a dashboard with information on the customers, which they can use to provide better customer service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;D. Quick Fixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rationale behind implementing fast, highly visible operational improvements is twofold. First, it allows the private company to build a positive image that it can leverage to improve customer relationships. Second — and more importantly — making low-cost operational improvements allows the private company to improve its cashflows and develop a corpus of capital that it can then utilize for making large capital investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediate operational improvements that were most frequently mentioned during interviews surround billing and metering. Often, when private companies take over, they realize that the previously operating public sector utility was underbilling consumers or not billing them at all. While sometimes this is due to faulty billing, often it is due to consumer firms securing unapproved preferential pricing due to a lack of proper oversight and transparency. Mr. Banga from Tata Power stated that the company must ensure that it is regularly billing consumers, sending them the bills, and providing them with electricity access 24/7. Only then, if a consumer refuses to pay, it is fair to cut their connections. Giving the example of areas where the company has been able to increase its collection efficiency from under 50 percent to 99 percent, he added that consumer education, and creating a mindset that electricity is a service that people need to pay for, goes a long way. The official from Adani Power concurred on the importance of consumer education. However, he argued that companies cannot take a “one size fits all” approach, and for certain areas better enforcement and coordination with local authorities can help. He added that building small customer care kiosks in multiple areas, where employees can assist customers with adopting digital tools, combined with rapid digitization, can help ease the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The respondent from CESC stated that they once found that large industrial consumers were being underbilled by a factor of 15 to 20. This was presumably due to collusion between the consumers and previous officials. While effective metering offers a solution for this, it can be very expensive to adopt cutting-edge smart meters. There has also been some level of consumer pushback against smart meters. He stated that the company has been able to move to a new, low-cost technology for meter reading which consists of a $0.80 port that can be installed on any smartphone. Using a mobile app, the port can provide meter readings within seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-Term Changes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A. Operational Improvement through Capital Expenditure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a private company has been able to make the discom profitable, it can start making long-term capital expenditures. Long-term capital expenditure is critical to the sustainability of long-term plans for the firm to remain profitable and ensure that the distribution technology is keeping pace with industry requirements. The optimization of capital expenditure takes time and firms cannot expect to seek quick returns from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from moving away from regulatory assets, the emphasis of capital expenditure needs to be on technology adoption. Two areas were highlighted during conversations: improving cyber infrastructure, including data and security, and modernizing physical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Banga from Tata Power stated that there are two reliable data points that the private firms have access to: input cost of energy and money entering the companies’ bank accounts. Metrics such as billing and collection efficiency, as well as AT&amp;amp;C, can be manipulated using accounting techniques. However, better data can allow for improved collection, management, and analysis of the data. Mr. Raghav Kanoria from IPCL added that the company has benefited from making advances in smart metering and billing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Torrent Power has made strides in tech adoption for data management, and as of 2022, it has digitized all its documents and customer details and implemented Geographical Information System (GIS) technology for mapping consumers. Additionally, it has achieved 60 percent digital payments from its consumers. Torrent has also been able to develop advanced National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) for improving meter testing and billing. The company has also focused on strengthening cybersecurity measures, including developing multi-factor authentication at its facilities, privileged access mechanisms, endpoint detection and response, cyber crisis management plans, and a dedicated cybersecurity cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official from Adani Power stated that the company has benefited from adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning to better forecast energy demands. Additionally, creating digital payment mechanisms for payments has increased digital payment from 30 to 75 percent in the past five years. The company has also improved data collection and management infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Swain from GRIDCO added that technology adoption in the private sector is usually quicker. This is because the private sector tends to be more agile in comparison to public companies, and it often doesn’t need to operate through the same processes as the government does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modernizing physical infrastructure includes improving transmission and distribution networks. This includes investment in improving load centers as well as the cable networks. For instance, Torrent Power in Ahmedabad was able to bring down the transformer failure rate to 0.3 percent as of 2022 — compared to the national average of 15 percent — by installing 12,000 distribution transformers in the service region. Additionally, it has modernized the cable infrastructure by replacing the old and obsolete networks — including paper-insulated lead-covered (PILC) cable — with cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable networks in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;B. Cost Optimization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While improving operational performance is beneficial for the financial health of a firm, interviewees from private discoms report that approximately 80 percent of their total operational cost is the price of procuring electric power. Given that private companies have little to no control on setting power prices, they must try to reduce all other redundant expenditure. One way of doing that and remaining lean is to outsource all “non-core” operations. The respondent from BSES mentioned that outsourcing tasks such as technology adoption and non-core manpower allows the company to leverage existing expertise without having to build its verticals. This ensures that management remains focused on the core tasks of the firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Opportunities and Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A. Renewable Energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the interviews, there is consensus among private sector stakeholders that renewable energy adoption is a significant opportunity. On the supply side, there is impetus from the government to incentivize renewable energy procurement through mechanisms such as renewable purchase obligations (RPOs). The respondent from BSES estimated that the organization should be able to move to 20 or 30 percent renewable energy generation over the next few years. One of the respondents from CESC stated that at the root of it, renewable energy procurement is a financial decision for firms. The good news is that after taking multiple factors into account, such as aging thermal plants and the penalties for not including renewable energy in the mix, procuring renewable energy is cost-effective for firms. This is also reflected in several firms’ expansion of renewable energy assets. For instance, as of 2022, Torrent Power’s renewable energy generation mix has reached 25.6 percent, and it is currently in the process of acquiring 1.1 GW capacity from ReNew Power. The official from Adani Power stated that the company has increased renewable energy penetration, from 3 percent at the time of takeover to 30 percent in 2023; they further intend to increase it to 60 percent by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the supply side, Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has provided its consumers with the ability to choose where their energy comes from. For instance, in Mumbai, companies have offered consumers the ability to pay a premium tariff to ensure that their electricity is being procured from green energy sources. Odisha Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC) has also offered a green tariff in Odisha. It must be noted that the first company to offer green tariffs in India was a public sector company — the Bengaluru Electric Supply Company (BESC), in Karnataka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distribution companies sit at a unique intersection where they both demand and supply renewable energy. Allowing them to gain freedom from legacy power purchase agreements (PPAs) could further incentivize them to procure renewable energy. In 2019, Tata Power advocated to MERC for consumers’ right to choose a green tariff, albeit at different prices. MERC agreed and allowed all electricity utilities in the state to raise the price by ₹0.66 (about $0.008) per unit for electricity sourced from renewable energy plants. MERC has reported an enthusiastic response from domestic and corporate consumers alike. Currently, Tata Power has 20,000 green customers consuming approximately 200 million units a month, with about 1,000 consumers being added each month. Adani Power in Mumbai has over 50,000 green tariff consumers. However, even as the central government has introduced the Electricity (Promoting Renewable Energy Through Green Energy Open Access) Rules, 2022, several states have not accommodated for these regulations. Mr. Raja stated that promoting open access is crucial for discom reforms. He added that promoting open access, while progressively reducing cross subsidies, can go a long way in the development of retail electricity markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The respondent from GERC stated that there is increasing interest in allowing franchisee companies to develop renewable energy microgrids in rural areas. Additionally, he added that private companies can be incentivized to install renewable energy by allowing for price differentiation between different consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Swain from GRIDCO provided the perspective of government-owned generation companies. He stated that there has been progress in expanding renewable energy generation capacity, due to support from both the central and state government. For instance, due to a low available solar/wind gradient, the cost of solar and wind production in Odisha is high. The government has been offering incentives in the form of waiving off wheeling charges, electricity duty, and transmission charge concessions to keep the price low. However, grid stability remains a challenge, and the state wishes to have investments in renewable energy storage technologies, especially pumped hydro storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;B. Institutional Challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several institutional challenges can be addressed through effective policy interventions. These include land acquisition, limited institutional capacity, and regulatory awareness. The official from BSES stated that the type of city and land availability for infrastructure improvements is a key consideration when companies are deciding to bid for areas, since the cost of building infrastructure is difficult in certain places due to differences in population density and land availability. The government can ease the process of land acquisition to incentivize companies to work in such areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate disputes between regulatory bodies and companies often lead to a capital crunch for the firms. These are accentuated by limited institutional capacity and the existing regulatory model. For instance, in 2016, Torrent Power filed a case before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) challenging GERC’s order for revising the regulatory charge down by roughly 60 percent. APTEL in turn referred the case back to GERC, which maintained its original position. While Torrent Power reserves the right to appeal to the Supreme Court, an expansion of institutional capacity would allow quicker reprieve to potential private sector partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of limited institutional capacity is the delay by state regulators in implementing the “Automatic Pass-Through Model.” Torrent Power states in its 2022 annual report that even as the Ministry of Power came up with the Automatic Pass-Through Model to enable distribution companies to pass on the increase in fuel prices through tariffs, the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) had yet to come up with guidelines to implement it. Mr. Kanoria added that the central government was taking steps in the right direction. For instance, he mentioned that the 2022 Draft Electricity (Amendment) Rules require utilities to revise tariffs monthly to reflect a change in power purchase costs. However, it remains to be seen whether the bill will pass and, if so, how states will respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official from Adani Power stated that both the government and companies should focus on increasing competition in the sector. He argued that it is imperative for customer centricity that different companies be allowed to set up their own infrastructure and allow customers to choose — akin to airlines and telecom providers. He highlighted that there is increased interest from the central government in increasing competition in the sector. The respondent from GERC concurred, adding that the commission values competition over efficiency. He added that the government tries to bring in private players in areas where there might be a natural government monopoly, such as infrastructure development. Ultimately, the goal is to increase competition and create supply-based tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the respondent from BSES claimed that there is a lack of regulatory awareness. The government in Delhi makes promises such as 24/7 power and consumer protection; however, discoms are often left out of the loop, and this can be a problem. More interaction between the government and private providers can thus be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;4.28反送中遊行前夕報導林榮基彭定康 張劍虹：黎智英冀催谷上街人數&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;張劍虹：感覺黎智英會晤美國官員後「幾雀躍」 編採政策轉趨「偏激」&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gPTur8y.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第13日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方在庭上展示多則 WhatsApp 訊息，顯示黎智英在2019年4月28日反送中遊行前夕，先後指示張劍虹訪問前銅鑼灣書店店長林榮基和報導彭定康對《逃犯條例》修訂的評論，希望「催谷」遊行人數。同年7月，《蘋果》推行付費訂閱，首階段向每名讀者收取3元的訂閱手續費，張提議把其中1元撥出來作為抗爭者的訴訟費和醫療費，後來因為民陣成立一個支援反送中抗爭者基金，黎便指示把款項捐給民陣基金。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英指示訪問林榮基-以催谷428反送中遊行&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英指示訪問林榮基 以催谷4.28反送中遊行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。就黎智英向張劍虹下達的編採指示，控方指黎於2019年4月以 WhatsApp 指示一名叫「廖兄」的同事：「我們會用林榮基的新聞催谷廿八號大遊行，但要做頭條必須有林的電話訪問，請與林聯絡促成此事。謝謝。黎」，而相關訊息其後轉發給張。張解釋林榮基是前銅鑼灣書店店長，因在國內被人拘留一段時間，回港後連同律師何俊仁召開記者會講述事件，此後便沒有再返回國內，故在國內被通緝。林其後移居台灣，因此張請當地的《蘋果》同事嘗試聯絡林，並回覆黎稱「老闆，我已經請台灣同事處理」。黎回覆「很好，謝謝」，之後再傳送另一個訊息「衷心感謝」。以張的理解，黎是「希望利用《蘋果日報》的頭條來谷28號的大遊行人數」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹按黎指示訪問林榮基-遊行前一日頭版報導&quot;&gt;張劍虹按黎指示訪問林榮基 遊行前一日頭版報導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱，由於當時他正在台灣公幹，而同事大概知道林身處某一間書店，所以便與台灣《蘋果》的攝影師一同前往尋找林。完成訪問後，張向黎報告「老闆，已經完成訪問了」，其後撰寫報導，然後把稿件分別傳送給香港和台灣的《蘋果》同事。其中香港的同事即時任總編輯羅偉光，讓他可先行以網上新聞形式發布。至於實體報紙，張跟時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏聯絡，轉達黎智英想以此新聞作為頭版，「就催谷跟住禮拜日嘅遊行，我就請佢（陳）去做A1。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年4月27日的《蘋果日報》頭版，標題為「林榮基流亡台灣 臨別呼籲 守護香港明日上街」。報導首段提到：「《逃犯條例》修訂殺到埋身，因偷運禁書被中國公安部追緝的前銅鑼灣書店店長林榮基為了不想成為逃犯，只好選擇逃命。他在佔中九子被判刑翌日隻身出走到台灣，投奔免於恐懼的自由。要永遠離開土生土長之地，他雖然難過，但痛心香港已淪陷，期望「香港人唔好詐瞓」，為了自己及下一代，每個人都要盡一己責任，上街反對《逃犯條例》惡法。」張解釋稱，林在訪問中以過來人身份，講述被壓迫要離開香港的經歷，並呼籲市民上街。而4月28日「反送中遊行」的確有舉行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎未覺滿意-繼而指示報導彭定康&quot;&gt;張指黎未覺滿意 繼而指示報導彭定康&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;遊行前一日，黎向張傳送訊息，稱林榮基的報導對催谷遊行有幫助，但認為氣氛仍然「未夠熾熱」，希望催谷更多人參與翌日的遊行，「俾我感覺係，佢未夠滿意。」黎又轉發數個訊息給張，顯示黎邀請「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）訪問前港督彭定康，以得到其對於《逃犯條例》的評語。之後羅傑斯回覆黎，他本人身在雅加達，而彭定康則在法國，會嘗試透過電話做訪問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭定康後來以訊息回覆，稱修例對於填補制度漏洞並不重要，反而它侵害香港的價值和繁榮穩定，對於香港的營商環境帶來恐懼和不確定性。政治活動亦陷入險境。彭定康又稱修例直接衝擊法治制度下的一國兩制和香港自治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱黎希望《蘋果》能報導彭定康上述評語，並在網上新聞及翌日報紙盡快刊登。張遂向同事轉達黎的指示，最終報導在4月27日刊於《蘋果》網站，並於4月28日刊於實體報紙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黎智英眼睛有問題-難以閱讀屏幕訊息內容&quot;&gt;辯方指黎智英眼睛有問題 難以閱讀屏幕訊息內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早休之前，辯方代表、大律師關文渭指黎智英因眼睛有問題，所以在被告欄內透過庭上電視屏幕閱讀涉案訊息時有困難，只能依靠聆聽證人讀出相關訊息內容。關又透露黎的眼睛曾做過手術，未知何時將會做下一次手術。控方遂表示會放大相關訊息方便黎閱讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;再次開庭後，關指懲教人員已安排黎坐在被告欄第一排，但這仍未足夠，經辯方與懲教、法庭職員和控方商討後，各方同意安排把一個電子屏幕搬到被告欄內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹指黎智英指示印製反送中長幡-隨報附送&quot;&gt;張劍虹指黎智英指示印製「反送中」長幡 隨報附送&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎於2019年6月13日指示張，指「星期日遊行泛民想我們印十萬張長幡35寸長15寸闊，派給遊行人士，給他們從家裹的窗口放出來」。張指因6月16日有反送中遊行，黎希望張以毛筆字寫「反送中」，然後印製十萬張長幡，隨報附送，讓市民遊行期間可以拿著該長幡。庭上展示長幡樣本，其中一張以黃色做底色，除了有黑色字「反送中」之外，還有「罷工、罷課、罷市」，張解釋當時職工盟正在策劃罷工，所以黎希望寫上「三罷」字眼以作宣傳。張指由於《逃犯條例》修訂暫緩，及後有人自殺，泛民人士如李卓人建議不要派發長幡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張提議三分一訂閱手續費支援抗者-獲黎同意&quot;&gt;張提議三分一訂閱手續費支援抗者 獲黎同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方之後展示2019年6月15日的 WhatsApp 訊息，張建議「就今次出來抗爭的人日後療傷和訴訟，我們可以在三元手續費撥一元出來成立基金協助」。黎則回覆：「非常好idea！」張解釋，由2019年4月1日起，黎決定推行「免費訂閱」，讀者只要登記做會員，便可免費閱讀《蘋果》網站新聞；同年7月1日起至9月1日期間，《蘋果日報》需向每人收取3元手續費，讀者才能看到網站新聞；直至9月1日起，《蘋果》開始正式收取訂閱費用，即每日1.68元。黎認為，將3元手續費之中的1元撥出來作為示威者的訴訟費和醫療費，可以鼓勵支持抗爭運動的人訂閱《蘋果》。後來黎指民陣已成立一個「支援反送中抗爭者基金」，指示「我們的錢可以給他們運用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年7月5日，張劍虹向黎報告指付費人數突破30萬人，並會按照黎的指示，請會計部同事以《蘋果日報》名義簽發支票，向民陣的基金捐款30萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第13日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。他稱黎於2019年7月赴美會見時任副總統彭斯和時任國務卿等官員，事後感覺到黎「幾雀躍」，並指示張報導訪美一事及「做大佢」。張憶述後來在言談之間，覺得黎「講制裁係多咗」，《蘋果日報》的編採政策亦轉趨「偏激」，例如「對成個運動比較暴力場合，同埋激進嘅場面，都會照報導、同情」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹感覺黎對會見官員感到幾雀躍&quot;&gt;張劍虹：感覺黎對會見官員感到「幾雀躍」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示一則由美國國務院前顧問 Christian Whiton 發送給前美國國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowitz 的訊息，載有《彭博新聞》的報導連結，標題為「Trump Team Sends Defiant Signal to Beijing by Meeting Activists」，內容講述黎智英赴美國會見官員。黎於2019年7月11日將該訊息轉發給張劍虹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱以他所知，黎的確於2019年7月赴美國會見時任副總統彭斯、時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧和美國國家安全顧問 John Bolton，該次旅程結束後相隔一段時間，黎與張才有機會就旅程談話，張感覺到黎對會見官員感到「幾雀躍」，認為對反送中運動有幫助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英出席網上節目談制裁-事後指示張劍虹報導及做大佢&quot;&gt;黎智英出席網上節目談制裁 事後指示張劍虹報導及「做大佢」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示一則《蘋果》報導，內容提及黎智英出席何俊仁主持的網上節目「細說中南海」，當中黎談及與蓬佩奧會面，蓬佩奧問黎：「美國可以怎樣做？」黎則回答美國可以實施制裁，讓中國官員知道其所作所為會有後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張供稱，黎出席節目後，吩咐他報導節目內容及「做大佢」，包括較詳盡篇幅、擺在較顯眼位置和安排推播通知（push notifications）。張遂通知時任《蘋果》總編輯羅偉光，著他跟進。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在張的記憶中，黎在訪美之前，曾經在私下談話間提及制裁官員，「等佢哋唔敢亂嚟」，但是首次公開談論制裁則是在「細說中南海」節目裡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹指黎訪美後多談制裁-蘋果編採政策轉趨偏激&quot;&gt;張劍虹指黎訪美後多談制裁 蘋果編採政策轉趨偏激&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，黎會見美國官員一事，有否影響到《蘋果日報》的編採政策。張則指，當時人們覺得「黎生原來可以去到白宮見到啲咁勁嘅官員」，並把香港的情況告知美國官員，張形容「好似有啲 high 咁囉，原來真係可以去到白宮㗎」，又指事件令人們認為「個運動好似⋯⋯啫係有希望咁囉」。張表示，後來與黎言談之間，「覺得佢（黎）講制裁係多咗囉。」他又指，《蘋果日報》的編採政策「後來愈來愈激烈，啫係偏激咁囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「偏激」的意思，張劍虹指黎在飯盒會及二人見面的場合裡，曾說過「示威抗爭、和勇唔好畀佢哋分化」的言論，「佢又會提到『抗爭會係長期性』咁囉」，「《蘋果日報》就會因為咁樣，而對成個運動比較暴力場合，同埋激進嘅場面，都會照報導、同情，啫（認為）係個政府同中共逼成咁嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示黎冀藉訪問抗爭者激起同情及抗爭情緒&quot;&gt;張表示黎冀藉訪問抗爭者激起「同情」及「抗爭情緒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹稱，黎智英曾經在台灣舉行的「飯盒會」上，吩咐台灣及香港《蘋果》增加「訪談節目（video talk）」的數目，由每星期4次增至40次。訪談節目需要找「泛民反對派有代表性嘅人」或「抗爭者」作為拍攝對象。張在回港後有跟進上述事件，而黎亦有與張討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張解釋，他們會找「抗爭者」講述為何出來抗爭，以及他們的經歷和苦況，張相信黎希望藉此「激起啲人對抗爭者嘅同情，同埋抗爭情緒」。但由於很多「抗爭者」不願出鏡，因此張建議用訪問形式拍攝，然後將片段上載至動新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示節目以泛民反對派代表或抗爭者作主題&quot;&gt;張表示節目以「泛民反對派代表」或「抗爭者」作主題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰希望了解更多關於「訪談節目」的詳情，張解釋節目時長45分鐘，通常會用「Zoom」軟件對話，由港聞組節目部同事負責，並以「泛民反對派代表」或「抗爭者」作為節目主題，有時會找他們到《蘋果》的工作室對談。張表示，曾討論過訪談節目是否最適合的方法表達上述題材。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張稱港聞組全程投入處理反修例主題節目&quot;&gt;張稱港聞組「全程投入」處理反修例主題節目&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，訪談節目是否由2019年反修例運動衍生，張回答不是。李亦問，自2019年7月至年底，訪談節目的主題是否全都與反修例及示威相關，張表示大部分均是，且「成個港聞組差唔多全程投入晒去做呢個運動」。另外，張表示負責決定訪問對象的同事需向羅偉光負責，而羅會向張報告，張最後會按照黎智英指示執行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰表示自己沒有看過《蘋果》動新聞，因此問及誰人可以觀看訪談節目。張表示，付費訂閱的讀者可以觀看。他又確認，直至2019年7月初，共有30萬名訂閱者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押後至下周二（23日）續審，下周一會給予時間張閱讀文件，但不會開放法庭予公眾。&lt;/p&gt;

The run-up to the election drew global attention because of the growing tensions in the Taiwan Strait. CSIS experts answer key questions about the election results and the implications for cross-strait relations and U.S.-Taiwan ties.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since current president Tsai Ing-wen was elected in 2016, official cross-strait dialogue has been suspended, and there is deep concern about China’s growing use of “gray zone” tactics and the rising possibility of actual hostilities. With the elections now concluded and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate William Lai the victor, all eyes are on the ongoing transition, which will culminate in Lai’s inauguration on May 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q1-were-the-election-results-surprising&quot;&gt;Q1: Were the election results surprising?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the election results were largely in line with public opinion polls, which consistently showed Lai leading his opponents. Lai, who is currently vice president, ultimately won the election with just over 40 percent of the vote. The Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Hou Yu-ih placed second with 33.5 percent, and Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) candidate Ko Wen-je received 26.5 percent of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also as expected, Lai did not win an outright majority of votes. That puts him in a significantly different political situation compared to current president Tsai Ing-wen, who won both of her elections in 2016 and 2020 with over 56 percent of the vote. Lai’s weaker performance is not due to the success of the main opposition party candidate; the KMT’s Hou received a smaller share of votes than the previous KMT candidate did in 2020. Instead, both the DPP and KMT saw their vote shares hollowed out by Ko of the TPP. Ko won more third-party votes than any candidate since 2000, when the KMT’s James Soong ran as an independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Legislative Yuan elections were also not surprising. The DPP lost several seats and saw its majority disappear — a fact that will significantly complicate Lai’s ability to push forward a DPP agenda during his presidency. Meanwhile, the KMT gained 14 seats, for a total of 52, just ahead of the DPP’s 51. The TPP netted three seats for a total of eight. This marks the first time since 2004 that no party won an outright majority and means that the TPP will play a decisive role in forming a coalition to lead the legislature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has taken several diplomatic measures in response to the election. Most significantly, just two days after the election, the small Pacific Island nation of Nauru announced that it is severing diplomatic ties with Taiwan and establishing relations with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement asserting that China has repeatedly engaged political figures there and offered economic assistance to persuade the island to switch ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timing of this move is obviously intentional, and it is a well-worn tactic Beijing has used to punish and isolate Taiwan under DPP presidents. In March 2023, China poached another Taiwan ally, Honduras, and timed the move to coincide with President Tsai Ing-wen’s transit through the United States. Altogether, China has now lured 10 countries to switch ties from Taiwan to the PRC during Tsai’s tenure as leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another display of Beijing’s influence, China reportedly pressured an international volleyball competition to relocate from Taiwan to Indonesia. China filed its protest over the competition in late December, but news of the move first broke on January 17, just days after Taiwan’s election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the diplomatic front, PRC authorities have issued statements criticizing the United States, Japan, and European countries for sending delegations to Taiwan in the wake of the election and criticized the U.S. State Department and the Philippines for issuing congratulatory statements to Lai. Importantly, however, the spokesperson of the PRC’s Taiwan Affairs Office put out a statement that seemed to somewhat downplay the outcome of the election: “Whatever changes take place in Taiwan, the basic fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China will not change; the Chinese government’s position of upholding the one-China principle and opposing ‘Taiwan independence’ separatism, ‘two Chinas’ and ‘one China, one Taiwan’ will not change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has also threatened economic penalties. Although both China and Taiwan are members of the World Trade Organization, their economic ties are primarily governed by the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), which went into effect in 2010. In April 2023, Beijing launched a formal investigation into Taiwan’s compliance with the ECFA due to a long list of Chinese goods Taiwan bars from import to the island. China recently announced that Taiwan had violated its commitments and a few days before the election announced an initial list of minor penalties. It is possible Beijing will expand trade restrictions in the coming months and make it more difficult for Taiwan’s firms to produce in China, with a smaller possibility that it would outright suspend the ECFA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, Beijing has not taken any major military actions in response to the election. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has not announced any large-scale military exercises akin to those seen in August 2022 in response to Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and April 2023 in response to Tsai Ing-wen’s transit through the United States. According to regular releases by Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense, no PLA aircraft were reported around Taiwan or in Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on the day of the election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the PRC did fly a high-altitude balloon near Taiwan’s northern coast on election day. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense began reporting the presence of PRC balloons flying around and over Taiwan in early December 2023, and the PRC has continued to fly these balloons frequently, including after the election. Additionally, after the election, from January 17–18, Taiwan reported 24 PLA aircraft flying around the island, with some of these conducting rare nighttime patrols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again Beijing’s desire to see a more conciliatory party win the presidential election did not materialize. Chinese leaders can take some solace in the fact that Lai did not win an outright majority and that his presidency will be constrained by the DPP’s loss of the legislature. They can also see some rays of hope given that the DPP moderated its policies over the last eight years under Tsai and did not more aggressively push for outright de jure independence. But international sympathy for Taiwan continues to grow, and the prospect of unification seems more distant than ever. As a result, Beijing will need to reconsider its approach if it wants a different outcome in cross-strait ties and to remove this issue as a potential flashpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q3-what-role-did-taiwans-economy-play-in-the-election&quot;&gt;Q3: What role did Taiwan’s economy play in the election?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative to other economies in the region and elsewhere, Taiwan’s economy has good fundamentals and fared relatively well through the pandemic. Yet recent volatility and some chronic problems — housing costs chief among them — made the economy’s performance a central issue in the elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s economy maintained steady growth through most of the pandemic, but fell significantly in late 2022 and early 2023, with 2023 Q1 growth declining by 3.4 percent, coinciding with the end of China’s zero-Covid policy and the subsequent outbreak of cases and sudden drop in its economic activity. Taiwan’s economy picked up over the 2023, with growth of 3.4 percent in Q2 and 2.3 percent in Q3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key concern for voters is the cost of living. Though some blame high interest rates, the cost of housing in Taiwan’s main cities is high by international comparison. Inequality in Taiwan is still low compared to elsewhere, but it has crept up the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also concern about overdependence on economic ties with China. That said, there has been a relative decrease in dependence, partly as a result of Taiwan’s New Southbound Policy and partly as a result of adaptations to growing U.S.-China tensions. From 2010 to 2022, China’s share of Taiwan’s exports only dropped from 28 percent to 25 percent of the total, but China’s share of outbound foreign direct investment from Taiwan has fallen much further, slipping from 84 percent to 34 percent of the total during this period, according to PRC statistics. (Taiwan’s data, which may be less complete because it only counts projects approved by Taiwan authorities, shows a much steeper fall, with China only accounting for 11.5 percent of Taiwan’s $26.65 billion in outward foreign direct investment in 2023.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another broad concern is the composition of Taiwan’s economy. Taiwan’s public is proud of the island’s global leadership in semiconductor manufacturing, and Taiwan is adding to its capacity at a faster rate than anyone else. Yet there are worries that the dominance of semiconductors leaves Taiwan putting its economic eggs in one basket while crowding out opportunities for other industries, which could hurt Taiwan’s industry and workers. However, the overall situation has remained steady. Services are a growing share of the economy and was the sole source of growth in 2023. At the same time, even with China’s massive manufacturing capabilities, Taiwan has managed to maintain a large manufacturing sector itself, with manufacturing contributing over 30 percent of GDP and 24 percent of employment in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q4-what-does-the-outcome-mean-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Q4: What does the outcome mean for the United States?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the absence of formal diplomatic relations, Taiwan is a critical partner for the United States on a range of issues, from technology to public health to security. That Taiwan held its eighth peaceful presidential election, even amid significant pressure by Beijing, is itself an important development for the United States. Taiwan continues to stand out in Asia as a vibrant, prosperous, and stable democracy, which would not have changed regardless of which candidate received the most votes on January 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to the election, the Biden administration, through words and deeds, made it clear that the White House had no preference in terms of election outcomes. This is long-standing U.S. policy and is important for providing space for the people on Taiwan to make their own determinations about how they want to be governed. Of course, different candidates offered varying visions for how they wanted to govern Taiwan, but all three candidates sought to preserve the cross-strait status quo in their own way, which remains the overriding U.S. interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As President Tsai’s current vice president, Lai has signaled clearly and strongly that he seeks peace and predictability in his relationship with the United States, with China, and with the global community. While Beijing may warn of Lai’s latent secessionism, there is no evidence that a Lai administration will seek radical change. He is not version 2.0 of Chen Shui-bian, Taiwan’s first DPP president. As such, the United States will likely have an active partner in Lai on a number of fronts, with much of the important work of upgrading Taiwan’s defense capabilities that began under President Tsai continuing once Lai assumes office in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Lai will face a challenging new geopolitical environment, and as a relatively untested foreign policy leader, problems will inevitably occur. First and foremost will be Beijing’s coercion campaign, which will only increase in intensity in the coming years. Building effective communication between Taipei and Washington to manage China’s likely stepped-up boundary probing, disinformation, and outright aggression will be imperative. Lai’s vice president-elect Bi-khim Hsiao has significant foreign policy experience given her recent role as Taipei’s representative in D.C. and will likely help Lai and his team navigate the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q5-what-are-the-chief-security-risks-going-forward&quot;&gt;Q5: What are the chief security risks going forward?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has long expected and prepared for a potential Lai victory, readying a range of political, economic, and military options to showcase PRC displeasure and punish Lai if Beijing deems his words or actions as provocative. Although the PLA will continue to play a key role in China’s overall response to Lai, it will not be the only instrument that China uses, and — depending on what prompts China to take action — it may not be the most significant tool that Beijing leverages. At a minimum, Beijing is likely to continue to ramp up daily military and quasi-military pressure on Taiwan. This includes increased PRC air and maritime activity near and within Taiwan’s ADIZ. It also includes the use of satellite launches over Taiwan as well as balloons to further diminish Taipei’s control over the island’s airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility that Beijing could use significant military force against Taiwan in 2024 if the PRC views Lai as crossing a critical redline cannot be ruled out. However, if Beijing does not view Lai as deviating from Tsai, several factors are likely to dampen Beijing’s calculus to proactively use significant military force against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Beijing recognizes that Lai did not win over 50 percent of the presidential vote and the DPP did not maintain a majority in the Legislative Yuan. This provides Beijing breathing space and allows China to continue to make the argument that peaceful unification is still possible and Lai does not represent the will of the Taiwan people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China faces significant economic headwinds domestically and likely understands that any use of major military force against Taiwan could exacerbate China’s domestic situation. PRC military action against Taiwan could further weigh on foreign investment in China and cause multinational companies operating in China to reduce their activities and footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Beijing has actively sought to stabilize U.S.-China relations and has increased official and people-to-people dialogues and engagements with the United States. Beijing hopes the Biden Administration will help rein in Lai to some extent. A significant PRC military operation against Taiwan could undermine the recent “progress” Xi Jinping has made in U.S.-China bilateral ties and further strengthen the positions of those against China within the United States. This is particularly risky when there is a U.S. presidential election later this year and most U.S. presidential candidates have already adopted tough positions on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Xi is likely aware that the PLA still suffers from significant problems. The recent purging of senior PLA leaders, particularly from the PLA Rocket Force, showcases the extent to which he is focused on rooting out problems within China’s military. Questionable PLA capability will not stop Xi from using military force against Taiwan if he assesses the political situation requires it, but problems within the PLA are likely to cause Xi to think twice about using significant military force if China does not have to do so now.&lt;/p&gt;

Analysts expect the satellite to settle into a position that would allow continuous surveillance of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, as well as Taiwan and Mainland China.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Paired with data from other Chinese surveillance satellites, Yaogan-41 could provide China an unprecedented ability to identify and track car-sized objects throughout the entire Indo-Pacific region and put at risk numerous U.S. and allied naval and air assets operating in the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-yaogan-41&quot;&gt;What is Yaogan-41?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officially, the Chinese government says that Yaogan-41 is a civilian high-altitude optical remote-sensing satellite intended for crop yield estimation, environmental management, weather forecasting, and disaster prevention. However, Western observers assess that Yaogan-41 is primarily a military reconnaissance satellite, as the Yaogan program supports the space component of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). China has successfully placed 144 Yaogan surveillance satellites into orbit since the start of the program in 2006. Translated into English from Chinese, Yaogan literally means remote sensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Yaogan-41 reaches its intended position it will become the fourth Chinese optical surveillance satellite in GEO. Notably, Yaogan-41 is much larger and heavier than its three optical predecessors. Whereas these other satellites were launched by the Long March 3B rocket, capable of lifting 2,000 kilograms (kg) into GEO, Yaogan-41 used China’s largest rocket, the Long March 5, capable of launching a 4,500 kg payload. Additionally, Yaogan-41’s payload fairing was 50 percent longer than the usual Long March 5 fairing, making the particular Long March 5 that launched Yaogan-41 China’s tallest rocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts assume that Yaogan-41 is also more capable than its three GEO peers, whose highest optical resolution is believed to be around 15 meters. This resolution is enough to detect and likely classify large ships. If Yaogan-41’s builders were able to incorporate technology Chinese researchers expected to perfect by 2020, the optical resolution of Yaogan-41 might approach 2.5 meters. This resolution would be enough to identify and track car-sized objects, the equivalent to seeing a strand of hair from 800 meters away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-is-yaogan-41-different-from-most-surveillance-satellites&quot;&gt;How is Yaogan-41 different from most surveillance satellites?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most remote-sensing satellites, including those from the United States, Europe, Russia, and China, operate in low Earth orbit (LEO), which is up to 3,000 kilometers (km) in altitude. The majority of satellites currently in orbit and the bulk of surveillance satellites operate in LEO because it is much easier and cheaper to launch satellites into LEO than into higher orbits. Additionally, for an equivalently sized sensor, placing that sensor in LEO produces sharper resolution because it is closer to the objects on Earth. LEO satellites, however, lack one characteristic that can be crucial to surveillance: persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical satellite in LEO orbits the Earth in less than two hours, thus only seeing a given spot on Earth for a few minutes. Additionally, due to orbital mechanics, it may take hours or days for that satellite to revisit the same spot again. Though a constellation of satellites at lower orbits can provide persistency by reducing the revisit time, satellites in GEO orbit at the same rate as the Earth, which means they view the Earth as if it is not moving. Only GEO provides a satellite, like Yaogan-41, with a persistent view of the same place. An additional advantage is that a GEO satellite can see almost half of Earth’s surface from its 36,000 km altitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of geosynchronous weather satellites, which are effectively very low-resolution remote sensing systems optimized to track large cloud formations and storms. However, only China and India operate high-resolution optical GEO satellites, but India’s system carries a multi-spectral payload and not a visible light optical imager like its Chinese peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-chinas-other-geo-remote-sensing-satellites&quot;&gt;What are China’s other GEO remote sensing satellites?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China operates three other optical surveillance satellites in GEO. These three satellites are part of the Gaofen program, which has 29 satellites operating in LEO for a total of 32. Gaofen, which means high resolution, is part of the China High-resolution Earth Observation System (CHEOS), an ostensibly civilian initiative to assist in agriculture, disaster response, and environment monitoring activities. In addition to satellites, CHEOS operates near-space, airborne, and ground-based data collection and processing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though China provided significant details about the payloads for the first seven Gaofen satellites, which often included multiple sensors, including optical, hyperspectral, multispectral, and SAR capabilities, it has provided little information about subsequent satellites. The three Gaofen satellites operating in GEO are Gaofen-4, Gaofen-13, and Gaofen-13-02. Launched in 2015, Gaofen-4 was equipped with a 50-meter resolution electro-optical sensor and could capture three images per minute. While unconfirmed by China, experts believe that Gaofen-13, launched in 2020, and Gaofen-13-02, launched in 2023, can capture images with a resolution of 15 meters. Yaogan-41 is believed to be the successor to Gaofen-13 satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these optical surveillance satellites, China operates one synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) satellite in GEO, called Ludi Tance-4 (Land Exploration-4 in English). Launched in August 2023, it is the world’s first and, currently, only GEO satellite with a SAR payload. The resolution of Ludi Tance-4 is 20 meters. The advantage of SAR is that it can see through clouds and at night. Like the three Gaofen satellites and Yaogan-41, China claims that the Ludi Tance-4’s mission is purely civilian and aimed at providing information about land resources, disaster prevention and response, and forestry applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-will-china-use-the-yaogan-41-capability&quot;&gt;How will China use the Yaogan-41 capability?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the United States, Europe, and Russia, China has emphasized the development and expansion of a high-resolution GEO optical and SAR surveillance capability. While there are civilian applications for such capabilities, those applications can generally be served by satellites operating at lower altitudes, which are easier and cheaper to reach and provide higher resolution images than GEO alternatives. Additionally, civilian applications such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and disaster preparedness do not typically necessitate the extra costs associated with persistent coverage, as these applications have no movement detection and tracking requirements. Take for instance, the equivalent civilian U.S. and European satellite programs, Landsat and Copernicus, respectively, which both operate satellites in LEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing, which probably assesses the greatest threats to its security and freedom of movement will come from the Indo-Pacific, has determined that it will pay a premium to obtain persistence and the ability to detect change in near-real time across the region. Using 50-meter resolution data from the Gaofen-4 satellite during a presentation at the International Astronautical Congress in 2016, China demonstrated it could identify ship trails, which form when ship exhaust interacts with clouds in the lower troposphere. Persistency also allows for real-time tracking, meaning that whatever China identifies it could track using the same capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paired with its existing GEO optical surveillance capabilities, Yaogan-41’s increased resolution means that China will be able to more easily identify and track U.S. and allied naval forces in the Indian and Pacific Oceans than it ever could before. This increased resolution may give China the ability to identify and track even smaller objects, not just ships, but airborne assets like fighter aircraft and bombers as well. While stealth technology can help aircraft evade detection by radar, it is less effective against optical sensors, as demonstrated when a Google Maps user spotted a B-2 stealth bomber flying over Missouri. Pairing data from Yaogan-41 and China’s legacy GEO surveillance satellites with trained artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms would likely automate and speed up identifying objects of interest. For example, the New York Times has already used a similar approach, pairing satellite imagery and AI technology to identify bomb craters in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its optical and SAR GEO remote sensing satellites, China operates around 300 other surveillance satellites in lower orbits. China could use its persistent, GEO surveillance capabilities to locate, identify, and track U.S. and allied naval forces operating in the Indo-Pacific region. In real time, such tracking information could be used for tasking China’s LEO surveillance satellites, which possess better resolution than GEO system, other intelligence collection platforms to gain more insights, or for targeting of long-range missiles, such as China’s DF-21 and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-this-mean-for-us-national-security&quot;&gt;What does this mean for U.S. national security?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLA leaders, whether for defensive or offensive planning purposes, seek to know the real-time locations of allied naval and air forces operating in the Indo-Pacific theater. Recognizing the limitations of ground-based radar, China has built up a capability over the last decade using GEO optical and SAR satellites — a combination unique to China and tailored to China’s security concerns — for identifying and tracking threats. Yaogan-41 may significantly improve China’s ability to detect and track not just naval vessels, but also aircraft. Paired with AI algorithms and sufficient computational resources, capabilities afforded by Yaogan-41 will make it more difficult for the United States and its allies to hide vessels larger than an automobile in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, other than submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies have assumed China already maintained space-based surveillance capabilities that could keep fairly accurate tabs on large surface ships in the region. Going forward, they should consider that China might also be able to detect and track aircraft, even those far out into the Pacific Ocean and those designed to evade radar. Though GEO systems would be sitting ducks in any conflict, they could serve a vital role in a first-strike scenario by locating and aiding in targeting of key U.S. and allied platforms. While clouds will still obscure optical space-based systems and AI algorithms make mistakes, relentless advances in Chinese surveillance capabilities could soon produce an Indo-Pacific region where there is no place to hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zIeR8bv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（18日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第12日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。談到黎曾下達的指示，控方展示 WhatsApp 訊息，顯示2019年3月前政務司司長陳方安生會見時任美國副總統彭斯之後，黎指示張報導及「做到最大嘅效果」。張遂把黎的指示轉達給其他同事，包括時任總編輯羅偉光和副社長陳沛敏。翌日《蘋果日報》實體報紙頭版便以〈彭斯晤陳太 關注港人權〉為標題。此外，黎於2020年5月指示管理層籌備英文版，形容黎「好心急英文版快啲面世」，又催促資訊科技部同事盡快設立英文版網站，因黎希望讓美國讀者「成為《蘋果日報》同美國政治嘅槓桿」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹續作供黎智英好心急冀英文版盡快面世&quot;&gt;張劍虹續作供：黎智英「好心急」冀英文版盡快面世&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。就《蘋果日報》英文版的成立過程，張憶述約於2020年5月中，黎智英成立了一個名為「English news」的 WhatsApp 群組，黎是群組管理員，其他群組成員包括張自己、副社長陳沛敏、總編輯羅偉光、動新聞平台總監張志偉、兩岸版的副總編輯蔣美紅、資訊科技部同事Connie Chan。而英文版主筆馮偉光亦在後來加入英文版工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，黎在 WhatsApp 群組裡開宗明義，當時「覺得係好需要成立英文版嘅時候」，遂吩咐管理層盡快成立英文版，並在群組內詳細解釋他對英文版的目標、期望和做法。黎亦指示張負責聯絡馮偉光重新入職《蘋果》，主理英文版。張遂於同年5月下旬相約馮午餐，其後馮答應6月初回來上班。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張形容，「黎生亦都好心急英文版快啲面世」，又催促資訊科技部同事盡快設立英文版網站，以及在《蘋果》的手機應用程式引入英文版頁面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹：黎智英冀英文版「走向美國」 使美讀者成為蘋果與美國政治「槓桿」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，為何黎智英認為當時是合適的時候設立英文版。張指黎曾在群組中表示，「如果外國讀者、支持香港的讀者，透過訂閱《蘋果日報》英文版，咁樣對《蘋果日報》本身嚟講都係好大幫助。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又指：「黎生特別提到做呢個英文版係走向美國啦」，因他希望「讓呢啲美國讀者成為《蘋果日報》同美國政治嘅槓桿」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱黎表明英文版寫手要「偏黃」、意指「支持抗爭及逆權」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，馮偉光憑甚麼準則，揀選中文版部分文章翻譯成英文。張劍虹解釋，馮主要根據黎智英的指引，黎在英文版 WhatsApp 群組，「開宗明義」表示選擇英文版寫手的標準，就是要偏向《蘋果日報》的立場，即「偏黃」，以張的理解即是「支持抗爭、支持逆權」。張又指黎曾經吩咐不要揀選「Pro China（親中）」的文章。於是同事討論後，確認揀選出來的文章「要係啲抗爭呀、逆權呀、制裁呀」，並與「反香港政府」及「反中共」相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英專欄「成敗樂一笑」其中一篇文章，標題為〈大時代快將來臨〉，又展示該文章同時被翻譯成英文並上載至網站。張表示，文章是由馮偉光根據黎智英定下的框架自行揀選。法官李運騰問，黎智英是否不會指明揀選哪一文章，張同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示黎冀透過與外國前官員等有影響力人士訪談-以造成輿論&quot;&gt;張表示黎冀透過與外國前官員等有影響力人士訪談 以造成輿論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後問及英文網站上的節目《Live Chat with Jimmy Lai》，張確認節目成立於2020年7月9日，並為公開節目，公眾可於《蘋果》網站及其手機應用程式觀看。控方問及黎設立節目之目的，張表示黎智英希望在《國安法》生效之後，與「外國知名學者、政客和前官員」進行訪談，因「佢哋都係有影響力嘅人」，黎希望藉此「造成輿論」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎會在訪談中提及香港被打壓情況-希望外國援助&quot;&gt;張指黎會在訪談中提及香港被打壓情況 希望外國援助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，黎會在訪談中提及香港的局勢情況，特別是《國安法》成立之後，「香港被打壓嘅情況、對於法治嘅影響、對金融中心地位嘅影響」，黎希望外國可以援助香港。張表示自己沒有親自參與製作上述節目，而時任《蘋果》動新聞平台總監張志偉則要協助將訪談片段上載至各網上平台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示黎及助手mark-simon負責邀約嘉賓&quot;&gt;張表示黎及助手Mark Simon負責邀約嘉賓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，誰人負責訪談前的安排和準備工作，例如邀約嘉賓。張表示據其所知，是由黎智英及其助理 Mark Simon 自行處理，並沒有經張及《蘋果日報》其他同事處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎在另一個訊息中提及英國駐港澳前總領事郭明瀚（James Cunningham）。訊息中，郭明瀚提及已經與陳方安生傾談，指對方關注修例爭議及抵抗的需要。郭明瀚提議陳方安生應該在美國報章《The Hill》（國會山報）發表意見。陳太表示已經嘗試，但好像未能凝聚「民主」力量。張解釋，郭明瀚亦都建議黎將這個新聞做到最大效果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到何謂「最大效果」，張形容意即將該新聞「做到最盡」，以他所知，同事有需要採訪陳方安生及其隨行人士，以獲得會見彭斯的內容。此外，編輯可將相關新聞擺放在《蘋果》手機應用程式的「焦點」一欄，使讀者一整天均可見到，而不會被後來的新聞替代。編輯可以決定該新聞放在「焦點」欄目為時多久，也可安排重要的新聞「推播」，使讀者收到推播通知（push notifications）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱，他收到黎的訊息後，便把該些訊息轉發給時任總編輯羅偉光，又著羅盡量採訪陳太與彭斯會面的詳情及更多資料，以及將相關新聞置放在「焦點」欄目，若果採訪到新資訊便可不斷更新網上新聞，「搵到新嘅料可以再豐富佢。」張亦把黎的訊息轉發給時任副社長陳沛敏，「等佢知道黎生吩咐我哋將呢個新聞做到最大效果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context in which decisions about human–machine teams and related technology are made is one in which the UK and the US face competitors that could reach parity in qualitative terms, and which possess selective advantages in mass stemming from both their industrial capacity and proximity to likely theatres of conflict, and from operational concepts specifically designed to target and defeat Western capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these unprecedented challenges, the UK and the US possess considerable operational and military–technological asymmetries as a consequence of their democratic institutions, longstanding organisational biases, and experiences that are difficult for their competitors to deliberately replicate. Both countries trust their militaries to adapt and innovate at the lowest level. They have experience in combined arms operations, including in expeditionary environments. And neither country suffers from authoritarian pathologies such as endemic corruption, loyalty-based promotions or heavy censorship. Using these traits to shape the way the UK and US militaries develop, deploy and use capabilities will make it difficult for competitors to replicate Western countries’ performance, even with the same underlying technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a broader offset strategy informed by these asymmetries, the UK and US militaries should use human–machine collaboration (HMC) and human–machine teaming (HMT) to: demonstrate the potential to decrease the military, economic and political cost of war for the US and the UK and increase such costs for their adversaries; achieve decision advantage and impose dilemmas on adversaries; and generate awareness in denied environments. Given competing demands for finite resources, the US and UK militaries should focus, in the near term, on developing, acquiring and fielding a specific group of HMC and HMT capabilities and enablers necessary for accomplishing these goals. Such capabilities would be selected in terms of enabling activity within anti-access area denial bubbles. This specific task can be broken down into a number of sub-activities, including improving sensing, analysis, planning and decision-making, developing lower-cost and more attritable forces, uncrewed sustainment for expeditionary forces, enhancing deception, and leveraging HMC for predictive maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, caveats. First, unlike in the precision revolution, the West will not enjoy an obvious, persistent technological advantage in AI, autonomy, computing, and other militarily relevant science and technology fields. Second, a number of barriers that prevent the adoption and scaling of innovations will need to be overcome if the military potential of emerging technology is to be realised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this policy guide, the authors argue that advances in human–machine teaming will be crucial to delivering effective offsets to adversary advantages. To execute an offset strategy, militaries will need to develop technology and dedicate significant resources towards the development of new concepts of operations and approaches that treat the combination of human judgement and technological capabilities as central to success. This will be key to leveraging enduring organisational advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to serve as a primer and policy guide for policymakers, outlining the ways in which HMC and HMT make use of the specific approaches harnessed by Western states for technological change in service of these countries’ asymmetrical advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging AI will be critical to delivering Western forces capable of competing and warfighting in the future operating environment, particularly against peer and near-peer competitors. Notable figures ranging from the current First Sea Lord, Admiral Ben Key, to former US Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work have stressed that Western militaries must leverage innovation to overcome adversary capabilities. However, Western militaries cannot assume technological overmatch against some plausible competitors, particularly China. Unlike in the Cold War era, when the West enjoyed clear qualitative advantages in several key areas such as command, control, communications, computers (C4) intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) and precision strike, in the future operating environment it could well find itself operating against China or a China-backed Russia – countries that can leverage a research and development base qualitatively comparable to those found in the West, particularly in areas such as AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering an offset strategy against such an opponent therefore involves more than merely developing or acquiring emerging technology. Instead, that technology’s impact will depend on how effectively it can be incorporated into concepts of operations that both accentuate the human and machine strengths of a friendly force and exacerbate the weaknesses of an opponent’s force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The militaries that best leverage autonomy and AI, then, will be those that best situate them within a warfighting system that includes concepts that guide their employment and organisational practices to generate forces that can properly use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This policy guide aims to prime policymakers on the factors that need to be considered to leverage human–machine collaboration (HMC) and human–machine teaming (HMT) for an offset strategy. Chapter I examines how the advent of AI and autonomy on the modern battlefield can change the conduct of warfare, and scopes both the opportunities that militaries can leverage and some of the challenges that they might face. Chapter II focuses on the specific operational objectives that militaries should pursue using HMC and HMT. Chapter III concentrates on priority capabilities where HMC and HMT can deliver capabilities before 2030 and give Western militaries a competitive edge – and the enablers needed to create and field them effectively. Chapter IV outlines general principles that should guide the development of the capabilities described in Chapter III within Western militaries and defence establishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;purpose-and-methodology&quot;&gt;Purpose and Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the research project underlying this policy guide is to inform future defence approaches in the US and the UK and, between them, on HMC and HMT. It was carried out through a partnership between the Special Competitive Studies Project and RUSI, and through separate collaborations with the US Marine Warfighting Lab and the UK Ministry of Defence. The project brought together experts and practitioners from across the national security and emerging technology communities via a series of workshops held simultaneously in London and Washington, DC. The first of the three workshops, held on 10 November 2022, focused on identifying existing HMC and HMT capabilities and forecasting the development of capabilities that could realistically be fielded by 2030. The second workshop, held on 8 December 2022, focused on further refining the list of capabilities, and on identifying key enablers needed for the rapid incorporation of HMC and HMT into military activities and operations. The third workshop, held on 2 February 2023, focused on identifying implementation principles for HMC and HMT for the US Department of Defence and the UK Ministry of Defence. The results of these engagements are the basis of this policy guide, supplemented by a review of existing literature and consultations with experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-what-are-humanmachine-collaboration-and-humanmachine-teaming&quot;&gt;I. What are Human–Machine Collaboration and Human–Machine Teaming?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMC and HMT combine the human, the machine, and the interactions and interdependencies between them. HMC focuses on optimising cognitive tasks, particularly decision-making, while HMT focuses on more effectively executing a wider range of complex tasks in physical spaces. Applications vary, and the most advanced applications will include elements of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we define HMT as a complex military process with a feedback loop between the human and the machine which changes the behaviour of both. For example, if human operators deploy an uncrewed asset such as a UAV into a contested airspace with specific rules of engagement, the human’s control over the UAV circumscribes its behaviour on the battlefield. Equally, the output the machine delivers independently into the feedback loop – for example, the ability to classify targets without direct intervention – can change the operator’s decisions and subsequent actions. This is unlike a tool like artillery, which is basically linear: an operator knows what that tool can do and can predict outcomes (bar anomalies and miscalculations) accordingly – and the tool does not independently generate behaviour or information for which the operator must account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core concept of HMC and HMT is that humans and machines have comparative advantages and excel in different areas. Humans generally outperform machines on high-context tasks (those that focus on relationships between objects, rather than on a particular focal consideration) and on various types of creative exploration. Machines, on the other hand, often outperform humans on tasks that require processing extremely large volumes of data, or which need a high degree of precision, speed or consistent repetition. Augmenting human weaknesses with machine strengths (and vice versa) can create interdependent HMTs that outperform both humans and machines individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in AI-enabled HMC, in particular, could expand a military’s ability to assess situations quickly, plan effectively and make decisions. A warfighter’s mental bandwidth, like every human’s, is limited. Military personnel collaborating with machines can break problems down into their component parts and allocate some tasks to be optimised, automated or performed at scale by a computer. Doing this removes some of the clutter that takes up so much cognitive bandwidth, freeing warfighters to focus on higher order processing, gaining situational awareness, understanding enemy plans and developing courses of action. It can also allow military personnel to quickly and effectively perform cognitive tasks that would be difficult or impossible without machine collaboration, and especially without automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To incorporate HMC and HMT, militaries can identify bottlenecks in their operations, delegate tasks to machines as much as possible, and move humans to the boundaries of machine capabilities, where they can undertake the tasks that humans can perform more effectively than machines. Militaries that make the transition to HMC and HMT could make decisions and conduct operations more effectively, more quickly, and on a larger scale than organisations that do not, all at a lower human cost. Though not a panacea, AI can considerably reduce issues surrounding span of control, much as automation does in the context of integrated air and missile defence. To the extent that functions associated with staffs can be automated, staffs can be shrunk – enabling the control of more capabilities at lower echelons. Robots can perform tasks that are too dangerous for humans, such as bomb disposal, generating ISR or attacking in heavily denied airspace, allowing units to perform operations that would not otherwise be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMC and HMT are not synonymous with full autonomy, which lacks the machine–human interdependence that is HMC and HMT’s defining characteristic. Full autonomy implies systems making decisions with no human intervention beyond design and initiation. HMTs might have autonomous components, but removing one human-to-human or human-to-machine relationship does not eliminate the need for teamwork between humans and machines – and it will not eliminate humans. Rather, it changes where the boundaries within the system lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, HMC and HMT rely on a degree of autonomy to be effective, especially during time-compressed situations or high-intensity conflicts. HMC and HMT can thus serve as stepping stones towards, or catalysts for, driving the pursuit of greater autonomy by helping develop and test capabilities, human–machine interfaces, and the military’s ability to employ semi-autonomous or autonomous systems effectively and responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-will-hmc-and-hmt-affect-warfighting&quot;&gt;How Will HMC and HMT Affect Warfighting?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effect on Casualty Rates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, states are likely to increase the use of machines to minimise casualties and improve operational effectiveness. However, because states have different levels of resources and experience with autonomous technology development, some will significantly outperform others with regard to HMT. If one state manages to overwhelm or bypass its adversary’s machines, it is likely to continue on to attack the human elements of the military, or even the civilian population. This would result in a significant imbalance in casualties between the combatant states, with the advantaged side sustaining few casualties and the disadvantaged side sustaining many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conflicts with more symmetrical HMT usage, the number of casualties that the combatant states sustain would depend on the circumstances of that specific conflict. During limited wars, states could be more likely to seek a negotiated outcome after a large portion of their machines have been neutralised or destroyed, but before they have lost many military personnel and civilians. During more total wars, especially if large numbers of people are mobilised (as is currently being seen in Ukraine), states are likely to continue fighting and thus experience casualty levels similar to those seen in wars without HMT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some caveats here. First, fewer human operators should not be seen as being synonymous with smaller militaries in general – the repair, combat support and sustainment requirements of keeping machines operational could create new roles that are not easily automated, or whose requirements expand with the number of machines. While this could still result in smaller militaries, such an outcome should not be assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, completely symmetrical HMT usage – whether from a capabilities or operational employment standpoint – is unrealistic. The rate of adoption of new technologies, capabilities and operating concepts across militaries – and within their organisation – will be uneven, leading to different rates of change in tempo and scale of operations. Boundaries of adoption across a military’s organisations can create friction, and limit the ability of one state to leverage the full potential of a technology or capability relative to another state. New technologies will also have differential effects on the components of a force, which will likely lead to different levels of hybridisation of HMT and traditional capabilities within individual states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, HMT does not necessarily entail the displacement of existing capabilities. New technologies often change forces by creating arms systems that combine new and existing capabilities. The armoured revolution, for example, did not end the role of infantry, although it did emphasise making them more mobile, and reduced their number as a proportion of the overall force. The future battlefield we might envision, then, is not necessarily one in which today’s platforms and personnel are entirely absent, but one in which, because they are enabled by HMC/HMT, the proportion of the force that they represent is lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, actors that cannot adopt a given mode of warfare will seek to offset it – as those actors incapable of fighting industrial-age warfare did by adopting guerrilla methods. If a smaller cohort of human operators becomes the tactical/operational centre of gravity in the context of HMT, adversaries will have incentives to target them. If this is tactically difficult, the weaker party may resort to means off the battlefield, such as attacking military residential facilities with ballistic missiles (as Iraqi forces did with US barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1991). Alternatively, insurgents who cannot easily target their opponents on the battlefield might pursue systematic assassination campaigns, as in Chechnya and Afghanistan. Increasing the number of digital systems will also increase the number of potential cyber vulnerabilities and attack surfaces adversaries might exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, some experiments have shown a tendency for automated swarms to fight each other to a stalemate. In such circumstances, the deciding factor may well be direct engagements between the human elements of two HMTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increases in Operational and Strategic Risk Appetite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As HMT capabilities improve, US and UK militaries are likely to shift operational risk to attritable machines whenever possible or appropriate. With this change, commanders can execute previously unacceptable manoeuvres, assured that their own combat losses will mostly consist of machines, not human lives. Commanders could also be expected to fight more determined defences if they were to expect that many of the losses incurred in so doing would be of machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restoration of Mass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMT can help militaries employ lower-cost, easier-to-manufacture machines to overcome complex challenges. Single, exquisite platforms have operational strengths, but also considerable limitations, including lengthy production timelines and high manufacturing costs. Although exquisite systems are by no means obsolete, their capacity would be strained by diverse swarms of inexpensive systems. In one of the first known drone swarm attacks, Houthi rebels in 2019 used 25 drones and cruise missiles to attack Saudi oil processing facilities. These facilities were defended by German Skyguard SAM missiles, which were completely ineffective against the drone swarm. Additionally, when the Saudi air defenders did adjust to the UAV threat, they were forced to expend very expensive interceptors on cheap uncrewed aerial systems. Mass itself, however, will not replace large and complex platforms. Decision-makers will need to consider the appropriate mix of attritable and complex capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massed machines, assigned tasks by their human teammates, could overwhelm traditional defences, often at a relatively smaller cost in human casualties compared to more traditional offensive operations, such as Russia’s use of Shahed-136 drones to exhaust Ukraine’s SAM stockpiles. Machines could also serve as the “eyes and ears” of their human teammates, particularly in urban warfare, by accessing hard-to-reach places, leveraging many different viewpoints, and taking risks that otherwise humans would have to take. One example is Elbit System’s LANIUS drone, a loitering munition outfitted for urban combat. These come complete with beyond-line-of-sight ISR and attack capabilities, an HMT mode with minimal user interaction and a top speed of 45 mph, which gives the user the option for strict ISR use, or the ability to attack a target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be an interaction here between the opportunities afforded by AI and trends that decrease the manufacturing costs of many capabilities, such as UAVs. For example, additive manufacturing may reduce the production timelines for missiles from months to weeks, and drive costs down exponentially. If this is the case, then much of the cost of producing a system might be determined by its sensor package and the necessary levels of integration (though the requirements of physical movement in any domain and the costs entailed will remain). This could drive a substantial divergence between the cost of simpler single-capability systems and larger complex platforms. The former can nonetheless be networked to produce complex results – for example, if multiple platforms with simple sensors cross-reference data to create a single high-fidelity operating picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMT may also change the ratio of humans to machines needed to perform certain tasks, with implications for mass in general. Today, in most cases, many warfighters collectively control one platform, such as a ship. While that relationship is unlikely to vanish, at least two other human–machine relationships are developing that could begin to chip away at the dominant warfighter–platform relationship. One such mode is a small number of warfighters controlling many machines, as seen in examples such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s (DARPA) OFFSET programme, which seeks to enable small infantry teams to act as controllers of up to 250 uncrewed air and ground vehicles each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another, less discussed, relationship is one in which a small number of developers create applications that optimise the performance of many machines and warfighters. This HMC relationship has recently been seen as GIS Art for Artillery (ARTA), a Ukrainian military software program used to distribute fire requests. The software enables multi-gun, multi-munition fire missions at a much faster rate than traditional targeting processes by allowing a machine to develop, interpret and distribute guidance to operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential to combine limited numbers of more specialised warfighters with large numbers of less expensive, uncrewed machines might incentivise a shift away from force structures based around more limited numbers of exquisite platforms. We might see the development of force structures that combine a limited number of expensive platforms and increasing numbers of cheaper, uninhabited platforms that provide mass. This would enable smaller units to cover wider frontages both on land and at sea – a belief central to concepts like the US Navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations framework. This approach will be important, because to survive on a battlefield characterised by long-range fires, forces need to disperse – but to disperse, they need mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that this vision will fail to be realised in all areas. In some cases, machines sufficiently capable of performing important tasks might be expensive, and therefore unlikely to be risked. The costs of platforms in any area often decrease with economies of scale, but the UK and US militaries still must determine whether machines should be viewed primarily as cheap munitions and sources of ISR, or as genuine complements to inhabited platforms. Drones can also experience high attrition rates, even in the absence of sophisticated counter-drone or counter-autonomy systems, and serve as new attack surfaces. With the proliferation of different types of machines, and an increase in their numbers, militaries will need to account for new vulnerabilities while investing in counter-drone technologies that are able to improve faster than drone technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force Composition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of HMC and HMT will raise questions about the degree of training and specialisation needed for select military tasks. The use of machines will almost certainly require greater expertise for some tasks, driving the need for new career fields in system integration, software development, AI and other areas. Other tasks, however, may require less training when machines help humans perform them. The conflict in Ukraine has shown how non-specialist units can gain lethality by leveraging technology. Other tasks and the personnel associated with them may vanish entirely, as HMC and HMT drive changes in operational concepts and force structure. If the future force involves a limited number of specialists and a much larger number of machines, the emphasis ought to be on recruiting or developing individuals with requisite skills to fill niche roles. If, on the other hand, HMT enables a levée en masse, then greater emphasis might be placed on procuring capabilities that non-specialist personnel can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Battlefield Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMC and HMT have the potential to increase battlefield awareness in several ways. First, they can expand the number, reach, persistence and type of sensors that the US and UK militaries field and access. For example, machine learning (ML) has enabled the sifting of false positives needed for the acoustic detection of targets like UAVs and helicopters. Second, ML can enable data from existing sensors to be more effectively exploited. For instance, low-frequency active sonar such as that used on T-AGOS ships can detect submarines at very long ranges, but produces too many false positives to be used without incorporating other data. This is another area where ML, in particular, can enable militaries to use the data their sensors are already able to gather, simply by changing the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, non-military sources of data gathering and transmission can become usable. Analysts are increasingly able to absorb and integrate data from non-military sources, such as commercially purchased and open-source datasets, as well as information reported by civilians in combat zones. This volume of data exceeds what human analysts can process. As AI-enabled software increases the speed and quality of analysis by HMTs and the quality of its presentation to military leaders, battlefield awareness and the ability to make data-driven decisions should also improve. Combined with the proliferation of long-range strike capabilities, this could increasingly remove sanctuaries and staging areas from future battlefields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of fielded forces to operate would rely on a combination of new forms of deception, such as the “poisoning” and evasion approaches used to confound ML algorithms, superior fires, and degrading enemy logistics. Such approaches to deception hinge on feeding opposing algorithms bad data or altering the image presented to them in a way that exploits a known tendency to misclassify certain inputs. For example, deep learning models used in cars can be induced to misclassify road signs through minor alterations, such as adding stickers to the signs. Even as AI continues to advance, it is likely that it will remain possible to deceive it, including in ways that would not deceive human operators. Moreover, blending in to the civilian environment through adaptations like containerising missiles and UAV launch platforms may obviate the risk of detection somewhat – but would increase the risk of civilian casualties. In effect, then, the central focus of deception operations in an era dominated by HMC and pervasive ISR would be hiding in plain sight. It would not be possible to avoid detection, but militaries could prevent their opponents from turning data into useful knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes to Command and Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMC and HMT could make it possible for smaller formations to operate with greater levels of independence. Automating staff functions can empower units that lack large staffs. Without expanding the size of the staff or increasing individuals’ cognitive load, HMC could assist with operational planning, logistics, adjacent unit coordination, and the deconfliction and tasking of assets historically held by higher echelons. This could be of use in information-denied environments where reach-back communications to higher echelons are not always available. A corollary would be that relatively junior officers would be entrusted with greater authority, potentially generating a training need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible, however, that HMC and HMT would help centralise command. Militaries such as China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have, despite some exceptions, emphasised the use of AI-enabled decision aids that help higher echelons of command solve information bottlenecks and exercise more direct control over formations. Confident that resilient communications are achievable and that AI will reduce the risk of information overload, the PLA envisions a high degree of synchronisation through giving theatre-level commanders control of tactical formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which view of command holds greater promise remains to be seen. The choice appears to be between flexible, laterally organised formations that aim for tactical flexibility, and those that deliver victory through tight operational-level coordination. Militaries like the PLA appear to be betting heavily on the latter form of command and control, which could represent a challenge if HMT enables greater local control by commanders but more uncertainty at the systemic level. This is precisely what has occurred in the context of algorithmic trading in financial markets, where the ability to routinise many actions has led to more individual control (and thus complex trading behaviour), in turn leading to greater complexity and uncertainty at the market level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-objectives-of-hmc-and-hmt-integration-in-defence&quot;&gt;II. Objectives of HMC and HMT Integration in Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, there is not always a linear relationship between HMC and HMT and a specific approach to warfighting – how a new technology manifests is mediated by factors including national and organisational culture. Some militaries might use HMC and HMT to enable decentralised activity, for example, while others might see it as a means of ensuring tight central control over a distributed force. This chapter addresses how the UK and the US can best leverage HMC and HMT to enhance the advantages of their own approach to warfare, and to undercut the ways in which opponents might harness the revolution in AI and autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge the UK and the US would face in the eventuality of direct combat with peer competitors, or with near-peer competitors such as China or Russia, is dissimilar to that posed by previous opponents against which the offset strategies of the past century were designed. Against the Soviet Union, the Second Offset leveraged modern precision-strike capabilities to enhance fairly tested concepts of interdiction through airpower. Its success was predicated on building and maintaining technological superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, an opponent like China is likely to become a challenger in terms of both mass and platform quality. The Pentagon’s 2020 China Military Power Report assessed China as having achieved parity with or superiority over the US in several areas, including integrated air defences and land-based precision strike. China enjoys an increasingly competitive position more broadly, for example in areas such as research citations: in 2022, Japan’s National Institute of Science and Technology Policy estimated that China accounted for over 27% of the world’s most frequently cited research that year, overtaking the US. Technological overmatch cannot be the assumed basis for an offset strategy in the same way that it was against a very different opponent in the previous century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the UK, the US and their allies should prepare to overcome an opponent that has near parity in qualitative terms, advantages in both the industrial capacity to replace losses and proximity to likely theatres of conflict, and operational concepts specifically designed to target Western capabilities and operational concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and UK militaries should work with allies to use HMC and HMT to pursue the following objectives as part of a broader offset strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demonstrate the potential to decrease the human, economic and political cost of war for the US and the UK and increase such costs for their adversaries.&lt;/strong&gt; In operating environments in which it is increasingly difficult to gain access or generate mass, shifting operational risk from humans to machines would change the relative cost. Perhaps even more importantly, as US and UK commanders gain freedom of manoeuvre and increase their ability to penetrate contested spaces, the cost of war for the adversary would increase. This would help address any perceptions that states waging expeditionary wars for less than existential ends have limited resolve. Such assessments, accurate or not, may lead an opponent to conclude that all they need to achieve the withdrawal of Western forces is the capacity to inflict a sufficient level of attrition. Even if this assessment of limited resolve is not accurate, the fact that it is held represents a challenge for deterrence, which ultimately hinges on what US and UK competitors believe. Therefore, demonstrating the capacity to limit human costs undercuts a major pillar of opponents’ theories of victory – and thus reinforces deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achieve decision advantage and impose dilemmas on adversaries.&lt;/strong&gt; The use of HMC and HMT allows militaries to increase the degree of operational and tactical unpredictability which their adversaries – with or without their own HMC and HMT capabilities – must address. HMC could improve and accelerate sensing, planning and decision-making and generate more options for action. HMT, having shifted operational risk from humans to machines, would also present commanders with a new and more favourable risk–benefit calculus, and increase the number of options. This is especially true if the machines in question are cheaper single-purpose platforms that can be more readily expended than comparable crewed assets – for example, an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle (XLUUV) as opposed to a submarine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Of course, if one assumes technological parity with opponents, success will likely be a function of organisational capacity, rather than technical skill. Organisations better able to interact with the machines at their disposal and to understand the interactions between individuals and machines on the other side are likely to succeed. We might consider how, for example, both Russian and Ukrainian forces have sought to confound one another’s targeting in often subtle ways, for example causing marginal adjustments to GPS coordinates in one another’s systems. Winning engagements has been a function of the ability to identify adversary-induced technical errors early and compensate for them – tasks that will depend on the human component of a force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generate awareness in denied environments.&lt;/strong&gt; The US and UK militaries need to use HMC and HMT to better understand their adversaries’ objectives, intentions and capabilities in order to be able to learn and adapt more quickly in a rapidly evolving operational environment. This may need to occur in the context of information denial, particularly at the tactical level.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At the level of strategic analysis, possible applications might include using deep learning to spot unique or anomalous cases (something traditional deductive models struggle with) or sift large volumes of primary data for patterns. The latter function may be particularly significant, as strategic intelligence failures are usually the product of surplus information, rather than a dearth of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At the tactical level, autonomy and AI can improve situational awareness in several ways. Autonomous sensors can lie dormant longer than humans, without their attention level decreasing over time and without the need to rest or move. This further frees up personnel for tasks that must be carried out by humans. Autonomous platforms can enable detection at long ranges using sensors such as low-frequency active sonar that currently produce too many false positives to be used alone, and they can also enable targeting based on prediction rather than observation. Furthermore, autonomous platforms carrying sensors can be risked in situations where crewed systems cannot. Another advantage of autonomous systems is that high-risk surveillance that might not be risked with human assets can be countenanced with machine assets. Though they may be lost in combat, such assets are both less costly than crewed ones and, in peacetime, their loss may not be as diplomatically challenging. For example, incidents like the Iranian downing of an RQ-4 Global Hawk in 2019 or the recent confusion surrounding the PLA’s surveillance balloon might be juxtaposed with the downing of Gary Powers’ U-2 or the EP-3 incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMC and HMT will help to achieve these broad objectives by helping to accomplish the following six military objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absorb and effectively use ever-increasing volumes of data at the operational and strategic levels.&lt;/strong&gt; The proliferation of military, commercial and privately owned sensors, alongside platforms that encourage data sharing for commercial services and rising internet connectivity, have increased the volume, velocity and diversity of data to a level that humans in operations centres, staff and command positions can no longer track and process. Properly programmed and supervised machines, enabled by a data-sharing regime, are well suited to augment human bandwidth, generating better situational awareness and recommending plans. This could be especially critical in the early phases of a conflict, before circumstances force both sides to adjust, information becomes more contested and old data becomes a wasting asset. The side that begins a conflict with the best available data can shape the conflict’s early, decisive phase. HMC can enable the exploitation of data already within the joint force – much of which is wasted. There is a second way that HMC and HMT can enhance the situational awareness of human operators: by enabling them to get more out of existing sensors. Many existing sensors have the ability to track elusive targets, but they generate false positives – something that can be overcome with ML, which is already being applied to tasks such as radar signal processing. A third way in which machines could enable the use of increasingly advanced commercial capabilities to transfer data is by providing encryption at speed and at a level that would allow data to pass through a commercial network safely. This is already the case with data passed on from the F-35, for example, and could be generalised. Finally, human and autonomous asset teaming can enable more aggressive data gathering in peacetime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a faster, higher-quality decision-making cycle.&lt;/strong&gt; Machines can accelerate decision-making cycles – often framed as observe–orient–decide–act (OODA) loops in military circles – to grant tactical advantage, create more time for planning, and react more quickly to adversary operations or adaptations. Achieving advantage requires controlling tempo and accelerating it where that grants advantage, not just accelerating tempo across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automate routine actions and processes to augment human decision-making.&lt;/strong&gt; Several tasks for field operations, operations centres, planning and sustainment require limited decision-making skill, but absorb a great deal of time. Automating and integrating these processes at scale could free up human bandwidth for more complex tasks, potentially reduce the number of people required for certain components of expeditionary operations, accelerate the planning process, and augment the quality and range of human decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generate physical and virtual effects at scale in heavily denied environments.&lt;/strong&gt; The proliferation of sensors, analytical tools, precision-guided munitions and non-kinetic payloads are fundamentally altering the hider–finder contest, placing traditional massed forces at risk. HMT has the potential to generate mass that can operate in such environments through the employment of prepositioned machines, attritable forces and complex manoeuvres.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overwhelm adversary defences with lower risk to friendly forces.&lt;/strong&gt; Some adversaries have developed anti-access area denial (A2/AD) concepts and capabilities that challenge US and UK power projection. Massed machines, assigned tasks by their human teammates, could overwhelm traditional defences through a combination of sheer volume and attacking on many vectors simultaneously, often at a lower cost in human casualties compared with more traditional offensive operations. They might also supplement crewed platforms by acting as decoys or stand-in jammers. Machines could also serve as the “eyes and ears” of their human teammates, particularly in urban warfare, by helping them gain more information about their environment and taking risks in their place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defeat layered standoff.&lt;/strong&gt; Power projection, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, depends on a limited number of critical nodes including aircraft carriers, airbases and ports. Over the past few decades, adversaries have progressively developed systems to put traditional modes of power projection at risk through the integration of air defence systems and long-range precision strike capabilities designed to counter Western strengths in manoeuvre. Restoring freedom of manoeuvre would require the US and the UK to prevent components of a given system from operating coherently by degrading the system’s functionality. This can be achieved by presenting both platforms and operators with a tempo of activity that they cannot match, and by stressing critical system dependencies – including communication modes, avenues for resupply and operator wellbeing – beyond the point of effectiveness. The more dilemmas a system is presented with, the greater the likelihood that its functionality degrades. HMT can also enable forces that are dispersed and capable of dynamically reconstituting kill chains to mitigate single points of failure, and thus deny opponents the opportunity to benefit from the effects of layered standoff. HMT and HMC can enable the fielding of cheaper, more attritable assets to maintain a constant tempo of pressure, allow kill chains to close more rapidly to facilitate responsive targeting, abet assessments of system functionality, and allow the use of predictive analytics to maintain responsive and agile logistics systems to facilitate a higher tempo of activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-capabilities-and-enablers-required-to-accomplish-these-goals&quot;&gt;III. Capabilities and Enablers Required to Accomplish These Goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given competing demands for finite resources, the US and UK militaries should focus, in the near term, on developing, acquiring and fielding a specific group of HMC and HMT capabilities necessary for accomplishing the goals described above. There are tools to improve sensing, analysis, planning and decision-making – for example, to incorporate real-time intelligence and running estimates into planning and simulations. Lower-cost sensing and attack platforms could develop attritable forces, manufactured and subsequently employed at lower cost, that pose a lower level of risk for human operators. By generating more mass, these could facilitate simultaneous attacks in greater numbers, with the desired effect of overwhelming adversary defences. Another use is the uncrewed sustainment of expeditionary forces in contested environments, which could improve the resilience of resupply and increase survivability. Further, (partially) automated computer network attacks can be used against adversary data links and ISR platforms, enhancing operational deception by leading adversary forces astray and disrupting – or even derailing – their operations. Finally, HMC could be leveraged for predictive maintenance: the automation of a range of maintenance and back-office functions could enable more rapid and efficient operations and free up human capacity for other tasks. These are discussed in detail below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priority-military-capabilities&quot;&gt;Priority Military Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools to Improve Sensing, Analysis, Planning and Decision-Making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and UK militaries could use HMC to accelerate the pace of planning, integrate real-time intelligence and running estimates into planning and simulations, generate more options in a given period of time, and more effectively evaluate the likely outcome of an action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperative:&lt;/strong&gt; Political leaders and military commanders face a volume, velocity and diversity of data greater than the human ability to process and understand it; this disparity is only likely to increase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promise:&lt;/strong&gt; Machines offer the opportunity to augment human bandwidth to not only handle this data, but to generate more (and better) courses of action than human planners alone can create, and to help integrate perception and planning across agencies. Machines can process vast amounts and types of data, aggregate it and turn it into useful information, and prioritise it for human decision-making. Machines, particularly unsupervised ML, can also identify novel patterns that humans have not seen (and which, in many cases, humans are unable to identify). Machines can also facilitate the resilient data-sharing networks needed to transmit data in contested environments. For example, NASA’s development of cognitive communications is one avenue for a resilient satellite-based communications system. NASA envisions gathering data from a network of satellites and their collective environment to overcome communication challenges with minimal human interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desired effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Using tools in these ways would improve situational awareness and empower a planning process that is faster, more creative, generates more options, and is better suited to creating a plan optimised for a specific challenge. The ability to plan with smaller headquarters or staff would also enable smaller units, operating in a fragmented and information-denied battlefield, to conduct operations based on horizontal collaboration with those units they can communicate with, rather than relying on top-down direction from higher echelons that may not be possible in denied environments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower-Cost Sensing and Attack Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and UK militaries could develop attritable forces that can be manufactured and employed at lower cost, en masse, and at a lower risk level for human operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperative:&lt;/strong&gt; Adversaries have developed A2/AD concepts and capabilities that place US and UK forces in certain regions at risk, limiting their operational choices and increasing the probable cost of operations in those regions, at the same time as decreasing their probability of success.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promise:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower-cost, more expendable machines would enable commanders to shift operational risk to machines and execute previously unacceptable manoeuvres or more determined defences, all with the reassurance that their own combat losses will mostly consist of machines, not human lives (or irreplaceable machines). Forces might also be able to generate more mass than they can today, allowing units to attack simultaneously on many vectors and in greater numbers, overwhelming adversary defences. It is important to note, though, that what is being described here is not a force of machines that can be expended with insouciance. Rather, it is a partial reversal of a mid-to-late 20th-century trend towards ever smaller and more expensive platforms (which partially reflected the need to protect smaller numbers of volunteer service personnel). This stands in contrast to the conditions of the early 20th century, when commanders had far more latitude in expending resources. A Sherman tank, for example, was by no means “expendable”, but the numbers in which it was lost on the Western Front in the Second World War (2,700 were lost by the British alone) made it a much more expendable asset than a modern Challenger 2 or M1A2. Programmes to deliver crewed ground vehicles, to continue the example from the land domain, will not create an endless reserve of cheap machines, but their success might be measured in terms of whether they can generate platforms that are as expendable as early 20th century crewed vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desired effect:&lt;/strong&gt; If attritable forces are created in sufficient numbers, massed machines, when assigned tasks by their human teammates, could overwhelm traditional defences, often at a relatively small cost in human casualties compared with more traditional offensive operations. These changes would increase the number of options available to US and UK commanders, and thus an opponent’s operational uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncrewed Sustainment for Expeditionary Forces in Contested Environments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US and UK forces could use HMC and HMT to improve the resilience of their resupply requirements, increase the survivability of flying and shipping and, if necessary, develop attritable resupply capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperative:&lt;/strong&gt; In a high-intensity conflict with a near-peer adversary, the US and UK militaries can be expected to suffer attacks against their ability to forward deploy forces and sustain them – attacks designed to paralyse the deployed forces and to prevent additional forces from entering the theatre of operation after a conflict has begun.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promise:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to the potential to create sustainment windows of opportunity by overwhelming traditional defences which might target combat support and sustainment, uncrewed systems could be pre-positioned or moved into theatre to resupply US and UK forces. A combination of uncrewed capabilities used for lift and automated planning could also help resolve one of the major challenges to sustainment – sustaining a dispersed force. Concentrated logistical nodes, although vastly more vulnerable, are currently preferred due to the challenges of planning and delivering logistical support to dispersed capabilities. Automation and AI could substantially reduce this burden by simplifying the process of planning and enabling sustainment to occur without the need for large numbers of crewed platforms. This could simplify tasks such as dispersing aircraft to mitigate the risks that adversary cruise and ballistic missiles pose.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desired effect:&lt;/strong&gt; If the US and UK militaries were able to sustain their operations using HMC and HMT in these ways, they could continue fighting at a higher level of intensity for longer, inflicting greater losses and increasing their adversary’s uncertainty, thus weakening the adversary’s ability to gain military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Operational Deception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deceiving adversarial forces would reduce US and UK losses and strengthen forces’ ability to penetrate adversary spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperative:&lt;/strong&gt; As mentioned in the context of the capabilities discussed above, adversaries are increasingly able to deny the US and UK militaries access to theatres, reducing their ability to mass force or achieve decisive results using conventional means.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promise:&lt;/strong&gt; HMC and HMT can (partially) automate computer network attacks against adversary data links and ISR platforms. AI can identify weaknesses in software or security programmes, while HMT can also enable feints in both physical and electromagnetic spaces and set the conditions for maintaining communications in the face of adversary disruption – for example, by more rapidly identifying which parts of the spectrum an opponent is seeking to deny (and thus which parts of the spectrum adversary forces are using). HMC can improve operational planning, including deception planning, particularly against other systems that leverage machines. Strategies for poisoning an opponent’s ML algorithms or hiding in plain sight require an understanding of how an opponent’s AI draws inferences based on decisions made. Understanding how an opposing AI works (and how it might be overcome) is thus one area where HMC can be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desired effect:&lt;/strong&gt; If the US and UK militaries can use HMC and HMT to enhance operational deception in these ways, they should be able to lead adversary forces astray; disrupting or derailing their ongoing operations, and injecting uncertainty about the validity of reports, intelligence analysis and vital systems performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage HMC for Predictive Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automating a range of maintenance and back-office functions could enable more rapid and efficient operations and free up human capacity for other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperative:&lt;/strong&gt; High-intensity or long operations, and long and complex supply lines, require efficient and anticipatory maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promise:&lt;/strong&gt; Automation and digitisation have the potential to predict attrition and repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desired effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Enable the US and UK militaries to enhance and harden logistics operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-enablers-do-the-us-and-uk-militaries-require-for-the-adoption-and-employment-of-hmc-and-hmt&quot;&gt;What Enablers Do the US and UK Militaries Require for the Adoption and Employment of HMC and HMT?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMC and HMT will not emerge and operate in a vacuum. Their incorporation by the US and UK militaries will heavily depend on critical enablers within the US Department of Defense (DoD) and the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), broader government institutions, and a diverse external ecosystem. The most important enabling factors are discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Operating Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military personnel collaborating with machines can break problems into their component pieces and instruct machines to optimise, automate and perform tasks at scale, allowing the HMT to make decisions and conduct operations more effectively, more quickly and on a larger scale than humans alone can do. But militaries are unlikely to make this transition without changing their operating concepts to account for the speed and scale machines provide. If militaries attempt to use machines to simply augment or replace human performance, they are likely to secure only a fraction of the possible benefits of HMC and HMT. In addition to not deriving the competitive advantages they might enjoy if they properly employed their tools, commands that do not experience the benefits will not be as incentivised to adopt the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three considerations should characterise the operating concepts that drive HMC and HMT adoption. The concepts must be linked to a specific military problem and connected to a recognisable model of operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most major innovation cycles begin as a response to a well-delineated challenge. The precision-strike revolution in Western militaries that began with the Second Offset, for example, started as a solution to the challenge of defeating the Soviet second echelon. It then gained much wider currency as the broader implications became apparent. However, the revolution in military affairs did not begin with a broad theory of change; rather, it came about as a solution to a very specific problem. This is true of other innovations, such as the interwar Japanese Navy’s adoption of carrier warfare to offset its disadvantages in battleship tonnage. In the case of HMC and HMT, the central orienting challenge should be overcoming layered standoff and enabling both theatre entry and manoeuvre. This is by no means their only potential application, but linking the development of HMC and HMT to a challenge that will be critical to every Western service against peer and near-peer competitors should ensure clear and well-supported lines of effort in developing concepts and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New concepts of operations should be linked to recognisable principles for action in order to be readily understood and adopted. Interwar Germany’s rapid adoption of armoured warfare, for example, was partially driven by the fact that many of its tenets, such as infiltration and manoeuvre at depth, were already embodied in First World War stormtrooper tactics. Tanks were added into an existing concept of operations (CONOPS) that they substantially changed, but without which their role might not have been understood. In effect, the German army reached the right conclusions about technology because its pre-existing critical task focus and concepts were well suited to doing so. Today, elements of the US and UK joint forces that have particularly well-aligned CONOPS and are task focused should be prioritised as accelerators for the adoption of HMC and HMT in the context of achieving theatre entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective Interfaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective teaming depends on a two-way flow of information and robust cognitive and behavioural models of the agents involved. With the progress of machine intelligence from tools to peers, human–machine interfaces will require increasingly advanced social intelligence in machines to support complex interactions and coordination demands between the agents. Optimising this interface requires machines to build accurate mental models of human teammates in dynamic and ambiguous operational contexts. For humans, integration is contingent on trust and confidence in their machine counterpart’s ability to execute goals safely and reliably to achieve advantage over adversaries. To improve the transparency and value of the interface, human operators need to understand the interdependencies and respective capabilities of human and machine agents in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The degree to which human operators require an explanation of the workings behind a machine’s output depends on contextual factors like time sensitivity and the level of operator accountability for actions taken. Moreover, the extent to which a machine’s working can be simply explained under different contextual conditions should be made a design criterion at early stages of development. It has also been suggested that end users be involved in the early stages of interface development so that they can offer feedback on matters such as the graphic user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workforce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US National Security Commission on AI’s Interim Report included an AI Workforce Model. Developed in partnership with the Joint AI Center and the Defense Innovation Board, the model outlines workforce requirements for the DoD. While intended to address AI, this model applies equally well to HMC and HMT. It calls for the DoD to develop three archetypes at different skill levels for the technical workforce – AI expert, AI developer and deployment specialist – and four archetypes for the non-technical workforce – end user, tactical leader, strategic leader and support roles. According to the model, adequate support for all seven archetypes will produce the technical workforce needed to build and field HMC and HMT, the strategic leaders needed to make policy and resource decisions, the tactical leaders and end users needed to employ HMTs, and the support roles needed to staff the acquisition, legal, and personnel systems. With this talent in place, the US and UK militaries would be much more likely to effectively develop, field and employ HMC and HMT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the expertise needed to train personnel in these roles may already exist within the force. For example, the operators of air defence systems such as Aegis destroyers/cruisers are among the more experienced end users of automated capabilities in the military. They have had to grapple with considerations like setting parameters for a system rather than directly controlling it, interpreting incoming data from a system, cross-referencing it with a commander’s judgement, and deciding how much autonomy to allow a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other categories, it may be necessary for militaries to rely on other models to source and retain talent. For example, private contractors might be one avenue through which militaries can reach out to qualified individuals without directly paying salaries that would void the pay/rank relationship. Given the substantial levels of contractorisation that have already occurred in Western militaries, this need not be a great leap. Use of reserve units might be another way of attracting qualified individuals without denying them their full earning potential. Countries such as Israel have succeeded in making postings in specialised units such as Unit 8200 (Israel’s SIGINT and cyber unit) sought-after jobs because of the private sector opportunities the unit’s alumni enjoy following a limited period of service. Reserve units could build links with the private sector to be similarly effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical Guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deployment of HMTs in increasingly complex and ambiguous environments requires machines to negotiate ethically challenging situations in which decisions have many consequences, including for human safety. Meaningful human control over systems and morally consequential decision-making remains critical, but the appropriate degree of autonomy will vary across missions. Militaries need to not only calibrate the tradeoff between control and autonomy in ethical HMT design, but also to define the parameters for dynamically adjusting this calibration to different situational contexts. Developing ethical models for systems will be particularly important in situations where machines exercise a high degree of autonomy. Models should account for the moral reasoning of multiple human and non-human agents interacting in an evolving environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structured Spaces for HMC and HMT Experimentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimentation is helpful for the development of both capabilities and new employment techniques/operational concepts. Experimental spaces should replicate realistic environments so that operators and technologists can experiment with and rapidly iterate technology to develop its optimal use across situational contexts. Locations such as the US’s Joint Readiness Center, the National Training Center and the Joint Multinational Readiness Center already provide realistic environments. High-fidelity simulations also offer opportunities to quickly iterate experiments, especially in preparation for real-world scenarios. To field new capabilities quickly, the operators and technologists should also be tightly connected to industry and to the acquisition systems of the US and UK militaries. Where possible, collaboration between allies could shorten these experimentation and acquisition cycles and enable further integration between them in the future. But to achieve this, classification differences that have hampered cooperation efforts in other domains would need to be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fielded Experimentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current processes for upgrading and using legacy systems are too slow to produce rapid adaptations to tactics on the battlefield. Driving innovation into existing weapon systems at the speed of relevance requires a new experimental paradigm, with operators continually testing capabilities in the field to build trust, developing metrics of effectiveness and updating capabilities in real time to make behaviours unpredictable. Fielding high-fidelity simulations of AI-enabled systems at the tactical edge, developing operator-focused analysis tools to evaluate risks and opportunities provided by new HMT tactics, and deploying synthetic data generation to adapt systems using in-situ collected data would enable battlefield operators to create on-demand tactics and rapidly deploy capabilities in response to a dynamic threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acquisition Reform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and UK militaries both need to develop more effective ways to work with industry to create capabilities. This entails addressing well-known issues with the acquisition process, programme risk and efficiency approaches to position the military–industrial–academic complex to learn and develop capabilities in real time as part of an action–reaction–counteraction cycle. Experimental spaces would also help to improve collaboration between military users and civilian-led technologists early in the development phase to identify necessary capabilities and improve the path to production and fielding, particularly at scale. The current defence infrastructure is not set up for the appropriate scaling and will need to be adapted to move technologies beyond the experimentation phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key adaptations must include incentives that make it appealing for a company to invest in technology at technology readiness level (TRL) 1. Target margins for companies specialising in AI-enabled military solutions may be up to 25% of costs – well more than the margins that defence contracts typically deliver. This disparity of expectation will be compounded by the tendency of defence departments to insist on intellectual property (IP) ownership. Solutions might include exploring the role of institutions such as the British Business Bank in delivering long-term R&amp;amp;D funding to technology at lower TRL levels. Payments could also be made on a “stages of intent” basis, thus reducing the risk to companies depending on an uncertain contract award. Finally, direct state ownership stakes in critical companies might be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-guiding-principles-for-the-implementation-of-hmc-and-hmt&quot;&gt;IV. Guiding Principles for the Implementation of HMC and HMT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translating the vision articulated above into tangible outcomes will depend on several factors, including political support for efforts to leverage autonomy, reforms to processes surrounding acquisition and the institutionalisation of fielded experimentation within a country’s armed services. The challenge is multiscale and will require many stakeholders’ simultaneous engagement. This chapter highlights the ways in which different stakeholders within the policy process, and at various levels, can drive change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-political-and-strategic-drivers-of-hmc-and-hmt-adoption&quot;&gt;The Political and Strategic Drivers of HMC and HMT Adoption&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political and senior civilian and military leaders must provide a clear vision and direction for implementation to lead the digital transformation. In democracies, policymakers often provide strategic direction to (and oversight of) militaries without engaging with the details of military change, which tends to be viewed as the domain of the specialist. While this is understandable, policymakers taking an active interest in force transformation is often a prerequisite for successful adaptation and evolution. Without suggesting that political leaders attempt to direct the tactical details of how militaries leverage HMC and HMT, this chapter outlines ways in which they can galvanise the process of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define Vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving HMC and HMT as part of the digital age’s transformation of the art and science of defence and security requires a well-defined vision. HMC and HMT must be cast as part of a “grand design”, not left to random experimentation at the fringes. Senior leaders in the defence establishment must articulate a vision of warfighting at the scale needed to win a great power war, then communicate it and resource it aggressively to spur services to implement HMC and HMT as an integral part of the solution to the operational challenges facing the US, the UK and their allies. Leadership must articulate the pressing threat, and how HMC and HMT can be employed to address it. The poor framing of operational challenges can cause bureaucratic elements to withdraw the support that is critical to overcoming the “valley of death” in implementation. Leaders could find themselves having to justify cuts to existing capabilities to enable change, which requires political capital and bureaucratic support to achieve in the face of organisational inertia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realising a well-defined organisational vision can also require a certain ruthlessness. Consider, for example, the controversies that accompanied the early 20th century dreadnought revolution, which was enabled by cuts to the Royal Navy’s fleet of pre-dreadnought battleships, many of which were scrapped. Notably, the methods that Admiral Fisher used to defend and sustain change, including relatively centralised decision-making using small groups and a willingness to weather external criticism, might be at odds with contemporary managerial standards. This dynamic is mirrored in the careers of other successful reformers, such as Admiral Rickover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration with Other Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development and employment of HMC and HMT must be integrated components of a broad strategy, rather than being left to experimentation in small, disparate programmes. As the Second Offset illustrates, holding service-level programmes to a centrally defined strategy can be the best way to both deliver the value of a coherent central vision and give services the latitude to propose their own programmes. However, it would be a mistake to assume that strong personalities like former US Secretary of Defense Harold Brown will always be at the helm to drive this kind of process – relying on remarkable individuals leaves too much to chance. There should be an institutional basis for ensuring alignment with an overall vision. Organisations such as the UK’s Strategic Command, which currently plays a role as a technical integrator, could take on the function of ensuring overall coherence as an institutional imperative. Organisations that play this role can also share innovation across services and combine service-level initiatives where appropriate. One might consider, as a commercial analogue, the role that organisations like Japan’s MITI have played in guiding collaboration between companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Articulate Priority Capability Categories, with an Initial Emphasis on Enhancing Existing Force Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any implementation plan should articulate a list of priority capability categories for HMC and HMT, such as the provision of low-cost sensing and the enablement of dispersion through automated planning. Buy-in will depend either on the cooperation of the owners of legacy assets or on their being effectively sidelined. While figures such as Admiral Fisher managed to sideline their opponents, this may not always be viable. The highest levels of buy-in are attained when an innovation appears to enhance, rather than to replace, existing kit. For example, aircraft carriers were initially “sold” to battleship admirals using the argument that aircraft could act as spotters for battleships, while vertical lift achieved buy-in because it was seen as enabling existing concepts of cavalry manoeuvre. Consider these adaptations to secure buy-in as examples of “single loop learning”, in which an organisation’s existing way of doing things is made more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial buy-in can set the conditions for more revolutionary long-term change by, among other things, opening promotion avenues for reform-minded officers. In HMC and HMT command and control, ISR and counter-ISR are areas where machines can augment, rather than supplant, existing capability. It is these areas that should be prioritised first, with the use of lethal and expendable platforms (a more politically and organisationally challenging area) initially deferred to a second phase of exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questioning Assumptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assumptions made about the development of capabilities need to be carefully interrogated, including the continued reliability of internet connectivity for military and civilian capabilities, the resilience of uncrewed systems, opportunities to collect or generate data required for ML, and the expertise required of humans and machines to perform tasks linked to an operational concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One major barrier to innovation and change is the fear of being perceived to be wasting public money. Bureaucracies are often set up to avoid waste – a potentially virtuous function – but in doing so, they can impede the levels of experimentation needed to drive change. However, politicians and the public need not be an impediment to expenditure on high-risk, high-reward ventures – indeed, in important cases like the space race or the building of the dreadnought, they drove the process. Winning the support of politicians and the public can undermine a major rationale for opposition to change – the argument that the levels of experimentation needed to support change will be deemed financially frivolous. For example, we might think of the 1957 exercise in which the USS Nautilus, then the world’s only nuclear-powered submarine (SSN), “sank” a great deal of the Royal Navy. The intended audience for the exercise was not the Navy (which already understood the value of SSNs), but the secretary of state for defence, Duncan Sandys, who had been invited to attend and who subsequently offered wider political support for a British SSN in the face of Treasury opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development and adoption of HMC and HMT require the involvement of stakeholders outside of the DoD and the MoD. Defence leaders must engage, and at times inform, their governments and the public. Building coalitions of support beyond the services and defence establishment is one way in which the initial momentum of programmes can be sustained. This was well known to successful reformers like Hyman Rickover, who was careful to cultivate relationships with both Congress and the press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engagement with Legislators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid many competing priorities, the DoD and the MoD must convey the urgency of HMC and HMT implementation to legislators in terms of the potential costs of failure. The war in Ukraine has showcased the importance of HMC and HMT by presenting a concrete and easily comprehended set of operational challenges that make a clear case for their implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politicians and the wider public should also be engaged in a wider strategy of re-industrialisation. Commentators have discussed how, in different areas, some of the enabling technologies that can drive rapid production (such as additive manufacturing and automated production lines) can drive the partial reshoring of manufacturing capacity. If this is the case, the production of expendable capabilities, which could require less specialised knowledge than manufacturing legacy assets, could be tied to wider national industrial strategies and so reinvigorate economically flagging areas in the UK and the US. Legislative buy-in, meanwhile, could give HMC and HMT the political protection that, for example, shipbuilding enjoys in both the UK and the US. To achieve this, however, procurement standards for expendable capability will need to be more permissive than those for crewed assets – enabling investment in generating these capabilities to be viewed as part of a virtuous cycle with spillovers into the civilian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing new and advanced technologies is not simply an issue of technology, but also involves policy and legislative direction. Successful policy, especially in areas that require organisational change or significant private sector engagement, often requires public engagement. The DoD and the MoD need to improve how they engage with the public – especially when technologies are being driven by the commercial sector – and help it understand the imperative of rapidly developing and adopting HMC and HMT capabilities. This includes prioritising accessibility over technical details when drafting documents for public distribution, as well as highlighting areas where HMC and HMT have previously been operationalised and been of benefit. “Easy wins” in terms of communication can be sought in descriptions of technologies that help shield troops from harm, such as bomb disposal robots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Where to Implement Incremental Adaptation and Where to Push for Transformational Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incremental change is necessary when achieving progress relies on gaining the buy-in of services and industry while still maintaining readiness and overall deterrence. Winning in future conflicts, however, requires transformation, and managed transition may be insufficient to encourage the DoD and MoD to drop enough legacy systems for transformation to take place. The DoD and MoD need a plan for transitioning from yesterday’s icons in favour of dedicating programme resources for the short to long term to build a process, not hold an event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means pursuing implementation on a two-track process: (a) incremental change, such as by identifying existing platforms or munitions to improve during development and combat; and (b) immediate transformational change, which might involve more bruising organisational change. Success stories can be created, and thus evidence of effectiveness communicated, through testing and modelling/wargaming with inbuilt HMT and HMC capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace at which change needs to occur may not be even across the domains or levels of warfare. The change strategy opted for could, then, be contextually determined. In some cases, direct (and unpopular) cuts by top leadership to existing force structure to fund new a capability may be necessary – like those imposed on the Royal Navy during the dreadnought revolution. Such an approach tends to benefit from more top-down leadership. In other cases, where the pace of change is less breakneck and the truly revolutionary implications of new technology are more unclear, incrementalism may be called for. An example is the carrier revolution, in which battleship admirals were reassured about their position in the emerging force structure. This approach hedged against risks because the implications of carrier warfare were not clear and only emerged 20 years after the first tests of aircraft at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this implies that a categorisation of areas that require incremental/transformational change should precede decisions on both the approach taken to specific programmes and the choices regarding programme managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bureaucratic-and-organisational-change&quot;&gt;Bureaucratic and Organisational Change&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militaries will adopt new technologies or capabilities at uneven rates across their organisations, causing the tempo and scale of operations to change at different rates. These boundaries of adoption can create friction and limit capabilities. To overcome them, the DoD and MoD need to focus on driving behavioural, not cultural, change, because behaviour is more instrumental and controllable, and will gradually feed cultural change. As an example, rather than attempting to create a risk-tolerant culture, the DoD and MoD should establish processes that force or strongly encourage some programmes to fail without ending a programme manager’s career, such as portfolio management. A process of adaptation will need to take place, aided by the development of new and evolved organisations that embrace shock, surprise and new forms of organising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section will describe some of the priorities on which such a process should be focused to deliver a positive feedback loop of self-reinforcing change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Internal Competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militaries will need to manage budgetary competition between the services, as well as the tension between those focused on the combatant commands’ immediate high-readiness capabilities and those looking to generate capability over the medium to long term. Further tensions may result from the way that HMC and HMT blend parochial service roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two potential approaches to managing competition for a common good. First, control can be centralised in a service-level organisation – as the US has done for space-based C4ISR in the Space Force, and China has for ISR more broadly in the Strategic Support Force. The demand signal from individual services can be mediated by a body that must be appropriately empowered (authority, capacity and resources) so that it is not junior, or beholden to any service, such as the Third Offset’s Advanced Capabilities Development Panel, or the National Security Commission on AI’s recommendation to establish a tri-chair panel. Second, services can be allowed to make budgetary decisions, with the role of the strategic integrator being to prune ideas inconsistent with the offset vision – as was the case in the Harold Brown years in the US DoD, where the offers of individual services were assessed based on their congruence with the vision of the Second Offset. Authority remains a critical success factor if the integrator is to shape the design of the force from the start (rather than merely integrate the forces it is given).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interservice competition can, if properly managed, have virtuous effects in terms of services being compelled to ensure their approaches are in fact competitive and expedite the evolutionary process. Here, we might consider the example of how aviation benefited from competition between multiple companies in its early days. Alternatively, services can be given the freedom to expend resources, so long as their expenditure can demonstrate coherence with a precise vision. This was the case in the era of the Second Offset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The degree to which internal competition is desirable is proportionate to the clarity of the underlying vision. If a vision gives the services clear joint goals, giving them the latitude to make resource decisions may make sense. However, if a vision is not sufficiently defined – and thus open to being interpreted by services in ways that justify their desired programmes – a central arbiter who can identify obvious parochialism may be necessary. An approach where the standardisation of certain elements is performed centrally certainly has historical precedent – consider, for example, how the US Navy’s NIFC-CA was predicated on inserting standardisation requirements into pillar programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarify and Raise the Risk Threshold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bureaucratic risk threshold for using new technologies is often unknown, and overall risk tolerance needs to increase, especially for middle management, if technology is to be adopted at scale within relevant timeframes. While leaders are taught at junior levels to nurture innovation and identify acceptable failure, they are not taught how to continue doing so once they become middle managers, where the risk environment is different. The question, then, is how to counter the conservative instincts of middle managers, who often see themselves as the means by which organisational risk is mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of altering behaviour is to change the cues that drive it, rather than altering incentive structures. Most individuals are driven by a degree of inertia which can be manipulated – for example, people are much more likely to benefit from a social programme if it has a voluntary “opt out” mechanism rather than operating on an “opt in” basis. In this model, reporting requirements for the rejection of a given proposal or the slow pace of a programme might be made more onerous, for example. Social cues, such as beliefs about the wider organisation, can also drive emulation – suggesting that highlighting the stories of high performers can drive wider change. People tend to be motivated by the actions of individuals within their social locus. Valorising examples from the private sector is thus unlikely to motivate a state employee, while publicising examples of change being driven within the military may have a greater effect. Finally, rewards and punishments for the responsible owners of programmes might be reframed to incentivise justifiable risk, rather than being predominantly based on outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an Infrastructure that Enables Risk-Taking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD and the MoD can incentivise the use of structured spaces for HMC and HMT experimentation (discussed above in the section on “enablers”) as dedicated spaces for trialling and prototyping high-risk capabilities. Through proper rewards, these spaces could lead to an inventory of innovative and proven operational concepts and technologies, developed during peacetime, which could be rapidly deployed off the shelf in response to the next crisis. It is unlikely to be possible to innovate if, as is currently the case, flying a UAV in a testing ground like Salisbury Plain requires an elaborate permissions process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing experimental spaces, the DoD and MoD must articulate a clear risk threshold for technology implementation: such thresholds are often unknown, which stifles risk-taking. The DoD and MoD can also set a predetermined failure rate for a defined set of programmes to increase risk tolerance, and should be prepared to reapportion funds based on the expectation of failure. In response to failure, they must be prepared to reward people for taking reasonable risk, even when their programmes have proven to be unsuccessful. The DoD and MoD can also exploit lessons learned from partially successful or even failed experiments and leverage subcomponent technologies that emerge from projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define Impactful Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often the case that senior leaders have a vision for an outcome but lack an accountability system to track progress and act as a forcing function to drive HMC and HMT implementation throughout the services. The DoD and MoD must build an ecosystem or accountability structure, with reportable and context-appropriate metrics, for the adoption of HMC and HMT capabilities and their impact. Given the diversity of tasks and contexts in which HMC and HMT can be applied, and where their integration is tracked, creating a variety of metrics that capture the context of specific applications is important. Because metrics can be interpreted in different ways, the DoD and MoD must clearly define metrics such that they lead to shared evaluation of performance by all parts of the organisation. These metrics must not only be measurable but also meaningful and observable in impact, not simply in outcome – which may not be relevant to the goal of transformation. Abstracted metrics could include consistency with offset priorities, military effectiveness, affordability, interoperability, adaptability, coherence, exportability and ecosystem capability. Another potential metric might be the degree to which a given capability relies on commercial off-the-shelf technology, although this might not be applicable in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;development&quot;&gt;Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD and MoD must consider how technology changes over time and how to best upgrade and use legacy systems without limiting their ability to adapt. This entails identifying specific platforms that could be improved, and determining the expertise needed to meet mission requirements effectively. Building capability to perceive and leverage emerging opportunities across the force may represent readiness and advantage over time. Some of the factors involved are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with design.&lt;/strong&gt; It will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to adopt new capabilities by using today’s force structure. Instead of starting with force structure and then moving to design, it is best to start with an operational need and use that to inform force structure while pursuing new capabilities. The implications of this approach span doctrine, organisation, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities with cost awareness. Militaries should also design interfaces for ease of human use and adaptability, not just for end function.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop iterative design and experimentation processes.&lt;/strong&gt; The DoD and MoD must develop an iterative design and experimentation process that enables rapid and continual adoption, deployment and adaptation of HMC and HMT capabilities at scale. Design and experimentation, foremost, must focus on goals and constraints, rather than on specific techniques that would work in certain contexts and fail in others, and account for the differential effect of components as they come onboard. Doing so will help the DoD and MoD integrate new technologies over time, and upgrade and maximise the value of legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build data infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; Leveraging the full potential of HMT requires an integrated digital data and infrastructure stack. Identifying and using surrogate data sources would also help to inform and generate data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).&lt;/strong&gt; Adaptation at the rate needed for effective performance in combat requires a combination of field experimentation, scenario-informed testing and CI/CD. CI/CD is particularly difficult for the types of operations militaries must execute. A tiered approach by which the DoD and MoD create the ability to adapt, then increase such adaptation over time, towards a combination of fielded development and CI/CD, would help improve capabilities and modernise most effectively. This might be much more viable for single-purpose platforms than for crewed multi-purpose ones. As such, should the UK and the US achieve a data architecture sufficiently open and modular in crewed platforms, the capabilities these platforms are teamed with can be improved at pace. This has been achieved, to an extent, by services such as the Royal Danish Navy, which has made modularity a core design principle. However, it does mean that where the demands of modularity clash with platform performance in the immediate term, the former objective is to be given priority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achieve scale.&lt;/strong&gt; Western militaries’ capabilities have been limited by the inability to field systems at scale. It is deceptively easy to launch AI pilot programmes with impressive results, but fiendishly difficult to deliver scaled final results. It should be noted, however, that quality defeats quantity in certain contexts, and some HMC and HMT capabilities may not require scale to be significant. Drones in Ukraine, for example, experienced a high attrition rate even in the absence of sophisticated counter-drone and counter-autonomy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure interoperability and interchangeability.&lt;/strong&gt; The DoD and MoD must design HMC and HMT systems with architecture that facilitates interoperability, interchangeability and fusion between systems, platforms and programmes across the services (and which are compatible with allies’ systems). This will require decision-making at the beginning of the procurement process and communication to industry about which partners will be part of the process. In the past, senior leadership-driven programmes such as the UK’s Defence Innovation Initiative and the Strategic Capabilities Office proved to be successful models for breaking down firewalls and fusing capabilities across the services to deliver new and improved capabilities. Senior DoD and MoD leadership must similarly intervene to establish an office (or other institutional mechanisms) that can fuse capabilities and special access programmes from across the services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Differences in classification levels impose another challenge for interoperability across allies and partners. The DoD and MoD must experiment with eliminating or suspending regulations that impede interoperability/interchangeability, engage in NATO standardisation agreements early, and integrate HMC and HMT into the NATO force model and 2023 family of plans to increase the probability of relevance and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage modelling and simulations.&lt;/strong&gt; Modelling and simulations can serve as powerful tools for rapidly developing and deploying HMC and HMT tactics and capabilities that empower the warfighter. The DoD and MoD must explore ways to: use modelling in large, complex simulations of the operating environment; field high-fidelity simulations of AI-enabled systems at the tactical edge; and use synthetic image generation to adapt systems using in-situ collected data to enable battlefield operators to create on-demand tactics and rapidly deploy HMC and HMT capabilities. In addition, the models need to incorporate as many details about the systems in question as possible. Models that make assumptions about systems, such as their inherent vulnerabilities, could have a counterproductive effect if they are then used to inform policy and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasise the user interface.&lt;/strong&gt; The DoD and MoD must also emphasise the ease of human use and adaptability in the design of interfaces, not just the end function of these systems. This includes the design of analysis tools to be operator-focused so that it is possible to continually evaluate risks and successes of new HMC and HMT tactics in the field. Iterative field experiments that gradually reduce errors and improve understanding of the boundary conditions of technologies can also help to generate trust and accelerate HMC and HMT adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursue industrial policy.&lt;/strong&gt; Industrial policy matters as much as military concept: inventory and production capacity must match the rate and endurance of use. The DoD and MoD need to improve their ability to integrate systems with wider government policy. Nesting acquisition within industrial policy, such as “friendshoring”, is one way to circumvent budgetary challenges. Competitors are able to provide insurance against risk to private sector actors via industrial policies that include subsidies. While direct subsidisation is likely to be politically difficult in the UK and the US, incentives such as tax breaks for smaller companies may be more acceptable. There could also be a substantial role for larger defence primes to act as acquisition hubs and as portfolio managers for smaller firms (given that the latter are unlikely to generate economies of scale quickly).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimentation.&lt;/strong&gt; The systems deployed today are not necessarily the same systems that are used to fight tomorrow, and experimentation is key to identifying the most impactful capabilities and outputs to win the next conflict. Given the speed of innovation and adaptation on the battlefield, new experimental paradigms are needed to iterate quickly, update tactics and generate new tools at the speed of relevance. Experiments should focus on goals and constraints, rather than on specific techniques (which will work in certain contexts and fail in others), and account for the differential effect of components as they come on board. Processes and regulations should also be the subject of experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generate options through modelling.&lt;/strong&gt; Generative models provide another powerful set of tools for developing “course of action” options. Experimentation should first involve modelling in large, complex simulations of the operating environment with physical, human, cognitive and resources layers, or a single synthetic environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create on-demand tactics.&lt;/strong&gt; Fielding high-fidelity simulations of AI-enabled systems at the tactical edge and using in-situ collected data would enable battlefield operators to rapidly deploy capabilities. Developing operator-focused analysis tools to evaluate risks and successes of new HMT tactics and fielding experiments to reduce errors and understand the boundary conditions of a technology are critical to generating trust in systems and their outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-sector-partnership&quot;&gt;Private Sector Partnership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s talent will focus on their current problems more than transformative new capabilities and their potential. Militaries need to consider how technology changes organisation and processes – including the human component, which needs more attention in both the US and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several steps can be taken to generate synergies between the public sector and private industry. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrating civilian expertise.&lt;/strong&gt; Competition for talent is extremely fierce. The DoD and MoD need the right talent across their organisations to make effective – not just deeply technical – decisions, but there is no flood of talent appearing, and Defence is not positioned to recruit the best talent. The DoD and MoD need to develop more effective mechanisms to integrate out-of-government expertise into government decision-making. This could be achieved with individual personnel by implementing secondments and rotations between government roles and private industry, as well as processes of co-creation, allowing for an exchange between technical experts and domain operators, with benefits accumulating over time to both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another mechanism to draw on civilian expertise might be the better leveraging of reserves. If reserve forces were treated as a pool of talent that serves in the military on a part-time basis, rather than purely as a means of replacing combat mass, they could be a valuable national asset. This model has been demonstrated to be effective in countries such as Israel. There is already some experience with this in the UK, which established the Joint Cyber Reserve Force. Such an approach requires the careful management of demands on an individual’s time, as many of the personnel whose skills are being sought will have considerable professional obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the private sector might offer avenues. Private military companies (PMCs), for example, can potentially pay skilled individuals far more than militaries can, and can in principle act as incubators for adaptation and change if supported by state investment. Of course, this raises broader issues regarding regulating their activities in third-party states. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of PMCs such as Military Professional Resources Inc in achieving tasks that have eluded many Western militaries (such as completing successful advise-and-assist missions with a light footprint) suggests that they offer an avenue to tap and retain talent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuel industry–government experimentation.&lt;/strong&gt; The military relies on civilian sector machines, datasets and infrastructure. An experimental centre or command environment for collaboration between functional and technical expertise would help to not only bridge the gap between military users and civilian-led technologists but also to better leverage private sector data. Partnered experimentation and training between armed forces and industry should be fuelled by government cash, and not just by industrial goodwill. Initiatives of this kind should also highlight the imperative of positioning the military–industrial–academic complex to learn in real time, within conflicts, as part of the action–reaction–counteraction cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reform the acquisition process.&lt;/strong&gt; More effective relationships between government and technology companies will also be key to overcoming well-known issues with the acquisition process. The DoD and the MoD should establish open-standard acquisition with industry to create rapid spiral development, not leisurely episodic fleet changes. This involves making space for original equipment manufacturers and start-ups (without being seduced by either). It must be recognised that the time taken to bring a new technology to the higher TRLs means that it is simply not viable for smaller entities to compete in the defence sphere. One way this could be circumvented is if large defence primes act as portfolio managers – purchasing smaller entities at a pace which means that their investments can pay off before the technology has matured to MoD/DoD standards. Incentive structures for defence primes will need to be adjusted to achieve this. While some tools, such as tax cuts, might be too politically fractious, other policy instruments, such as direct state investment in research and development, which already occurs to a significant extent in the medical sector, might be an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This policy guide demonstrates the extent to which HMC and HMT are essential for Western militaries. A combination of capable individuals – particularly at junior levels – and both AI and autonomy enables concepts of manoeuvre that are challenging for more rigid and hierarchical command structures. Such concepts could prove to be the bane of technologically sophisticated but organisationally rigid opponents. HMC and HMT also promise to deliver the redundancy that Western force structures have lacked since the end of the Cold War, but require in order to succeed in future conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of HMC and HMT into force design will, however, be predicated on several structural and cultural changes within defence. In particular, altering procurement priorities to emphasise expendable capabilities and improvements in software (rather than in hardware) will require levels of risk tolerance that challenge deeply ingrained organisational qualities and processes. In addition, the cultivation of human capital will remain an enduring concern that will be as important as procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approaches that militaries and defence bureaucracies take will be contextual. There is no “one size fits all” solution. As illustrated in this policy guide, the leadership styles and levels of risk tolerance needed will depend on factors such as the immediacy with which a given capability must be fielded, the opportunity costs of delivering it, and institutional flexibility. In some cases, the benefits of better resourcing existing capabilities may outweigh those gained from using HMC and HMT. In other contexts, the imperative to use HMC and HMT will be overriding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of conflict is punctuated with moments of disruptive change that fundamentally alter the character of warfare. The confluence of unprecedented volumes of data made available and usable by AI, the growing ubiquity of automation, and the emergence of new modes of producing physical capabilities could mean that we are on the cusp of such a moment. Those states and organisations that have benefited most from periods of change were institutionally capable of comprehending the ways in which they could leverage new capabilities and integrate them at scale. Since transformation requires the state as a whole to play a role, the requirements to achieve it must be understood beyond the uniformed military. This policy guide serves as a framework that outlines both the opportunities provided by HMC and HMT and the approaches that can facilitate adoption. Though it makes no specific claims regarding large programmatic decisions, it strives to offer a basis on which such decisions might be made in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（17日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第11日審訊。已認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。張於1991年加入《壹週刊》，並於1994年升任為總編輯，其後於2005年離開壹傳媒集團。5年後，張接受黎的邀請重新入職，並於2016年升任為《蘋果日報》社長。張形容黎是集團的「最高領導人」及「最終決策人」，被問到何謂「黎智英的編採指示」，張指黎的形象「一直以來都好鮮明」，即追求「民主、自由、反極權」，特別是2019年反修例事件開始，黎認為要透過《蘋果日報》呼籲市民上街、示威及抗爭，並在國際層面上希望獲得西方民主國家的關注，「希望佢哋能夠提供援助，甚至一啲強烈啲嘅行動，好似制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;前蘋果日報社長張劍虹循職員通道出庭&quot;&gt;前蘋果日報社長張劍虹循職員通道出庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方傳召首名證人、前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹出庭作供。張於2022年5月承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪，現正還柙候判。他身穿黑色西裝褸、深藍色格仔恤衫，透過法官席旁邊的職員通道進入法庭，由三名懲教人員的帶領下步行至證人台就坐。張手持聖經，以基督教儀式宣誓，其後開始以廣東話作供，一名法庭傳譯員坐在其身旁把供詞翻譯成英語。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹於1991年加入壹週刊-1994年升任總編輯&quot;&gt;張劍虹於1991年加入壹週刊 1994年升任總編輯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方主問下，張確認他畢業於香港中文大學社會科學及新聞學學士學位課程。他於2021年6月17日被警方以「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪名拘捕，之後被正式起訴該罪及煽動刊物罪，同案被告包括黎智英、陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗、馮偉光、楊清奇及3間蘋果公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張確認自己於2021年6月17日被捕，而控罪則提及他直至2021年6月24日仍參與本案的串謀，法官李運騰關注到，這是否指稱張在還柙的數天期間仍然有參與串謀。李官認為情況並不尋常，並要求控方澄清。周天行表示稍後會向張問及此事並澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方提問下，張先交代他在壹傳媒集團的工作經驗。他憶述於1991年加入《壹週刊》，當時任職財經組編輯。1994年，他獲黎智英委任為《壹週刊》總編輯：「因為黎生對我工作表現滿意。」張提到，雖然當時《壹週刊》社長是楊懷康，但是黎智英每日都會在辦公室工作，參與雜誌的事務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張解釋，他加入《壹週刊》時候，公司業務只有一本雜誌，後來發展出愈來愈多雜誌，包括《一本便利》。及後1995年，黎智英創立《蘋果日報》，並於1999年上市，就在那時形成了一個壹傳媒集團。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹於2005年離職-5年後黎智英邀請下重新入職&quot;&gt;張劍虹於2005年離職 5年後黎智英邀請下重新入職&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續稱，在2000年左右，黎智英決定在台灣創辦《壹週刊》，於是委派張赴台灣協助創辦雜誌。張稱在2001至2005年間，他是台灣《壹週刊》的社長，並與黎緊密合作，故有很長時間留在台灣工作，平均每週有約3日身處台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直到2005年4月，張有見台灣《壹週刊》業務已上軌道，加上開始有盈餘，所以他決定離開壹傳媒集團，「因為想趁呢個機會休息吓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2010年，在黎智英的邀請下，張劍虹重新加入壹傳媒集團，任職內容顧問。約於2011年4月，黎將他調職往《蘋果日報》，擔任總編輯。在2011年4至12月期間，張根據本地報刊條例登記為《蘋果日報》的註冊編輯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2016年張升任蘋果日報社長-相信因獲黎欣賞工作能力&quot;&gt;2016年張升任蘋果日報社長 相信因獲黎欣賞工作能力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱他於2014年12月起擔任《蘋果日報》副社長一段時間。至2016年左右，他獲黎智英升任為社長。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到張知不知道為何黎決定將他升職。法官李運騰一度打斷，質疑此問題與案件無關，控方則稱可以顯示黎與張之間的關係。張遂回答，相信是因為黎欣賞他的工作能力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續稱，他作為《蘋果日報》的社長，會負責整個《蘋果日報》的營運和確保報紙每日出版。被問到社長與總編輯之間在職務上的分別，張解釋總編輯負責每日登報文章的審批及決策，而決策包括新聞選材、角度及決定哪一宗新聞做頭條；而社長則負責較高層面的監督工作，包括確保報紙的出版及運作，以及確保編採方針符合黎智英的政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017年，張獲黎委任為壹傳媒有限公司，即整個壹傳媒集團的副行政總裁。2018年2月，張繼而獲委任為集團的行政總裁、執行董事，以及集團旗下公司的董事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹指黎智英為壹傳媒的最高領導人及最終決策人&quot;&gt;張劍虹指黎智英為壹傳媒的「最高領導人」及「最終決策人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向張展示壹傳媒集團的2019至2020年度的年報，封面寫有「Witness History」字眼，年報內容包括主席黎智英的話、公司的業務分佈、香港及台灣《蘋果日報》的出版業務等。控方續展示列出董事局成員的頁面，張確認直至2020年3月31日，董事局共有7名成員，包括2名執行董事、2名非執行董事，以及3名獨立非執行董事。直至同年5月25日，董事局成員的組合有變，改為3名執行董事、1名非執行董事，以及3名獨立非執行董事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;年報中列出黎智英為主席，張劍虹則為行政總裁。張確認黎於2018至2020年均任主席。控方問及兩人的職務有何分別，張表示：「黎生作為主席，係成個集團嘅最高領導人同最終決策人」，「我自己作為行政總裁，負責執行黎生同董事局嘅指示。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指3名非執行董事包括華爾街日報前社長南華早報前總編輯&quot;&gt;張指3名非執行董事包括《華爾街日報》前社長、《南華早報》前總編輯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續解釋該3名執行董事，分別為黎智英、他自己以及周達權。他指周為財政營運總裁，負責的範疇包括行政、公司秘書、廣告以及管理印刷廠。至於1名非執行董事為葉一堅，他為台灣《蘋果日報》的顧問，亦負責監督董事會。另外，3名獨立非執行董事分別為：《華爾街日報》前社長 Louis Gordon Crovitz、《南華早報》前總編輯 Mark Lambert Clifford，及專業會計師 Lam Chung Yan, Eric。3人均負責監察董事局的運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎智英曾任非執行董事-期間仍積極參與集團決策及運作&quot;&gt;張指黎智英曾任非執行董事 期間仍積極參與集團決策及運作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張確認黎智英於2018年2月至2020年5月25日期間，為集團的非執行董事；但於2020年5月25日後，他恢復為執行董事。控方追問原因，張表示不清楚記得原因，但補充指：「不過我自己覺得，雖然佢自2018年2月到2020年月係非執行董事，但係佢都好積極參與成個集團嘅決策同運作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示副社長陳沛敏負責每天揀選蘋果日報頭版新聞&quot;&gt;張表示副社長陳沛敏負責每天揀選《蘋果日報》頭版新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後問及壹傳媒集團的高層，張表示陳沛敏於2019年4月至2021年6月為副社長，主要職責是負責《蘋果日報》紙媒的決策，以及每日揀選《蘋果日報》的頭版新聞、港聞各版的頭條，同時亦負責審批各部門的開支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示總編輯羅偉光負責網站新聞管理編採部同事&quot;&gt;張表示總編輯羅偉光負責網站新聞、管理編採部同事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，羅偉光則任總編輯，主要負責《蘋果日報》網站的中文新聞出版，以及管理港聞版編採部同事。張表示理論上羅應該同時紙媒稿件的審批工作，但由於2019至2021年公司集中於網上新聞，而網上新聞需要24小時運作，因此張把紙媒工作交由陳沛敏負責。張表示陳的職位較羅高。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於執行總編輯林文宗則為陳沛敏的助手，於陳休假時會協助處理審批紙媒的職務，包括跟進執行編採會議中陳給予員工的指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一執行總編輯馮偉光，自2020年6月起負責《蘋果日報》的網上英文版，並會在每天的紙媒或網上稿件中，選取某些翻譯成英文。他亦負責管理外判翻譯團隊，並聯繫專門為英文版寫稿的寫手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎智英會透過-mark-simon-等介紹英文版寫手&quot;&gt;張指黎智英會透過 Mark Simon 等介紹英文版寫手&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，馮需否向任何人索取指示，張表示馮會自行決定揀選甚麼稿件翻譯，有需要時馮會問他。他補充，雖然架構上馮應該向羅偉光負責，「但係多數有關於呢樣嘢，佢都會搵我嘅。」控方追問馮需否向其他人索取指示；張解釋黎智英原本已經好清楚指示英文版的編採運作，黎亦會透過 Mark Simon 及 Mark Clifford 介紹寫手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，馮亦以筆名「盧峯」在專欄「蘋論」撰寫政治評論，他尚未負責英文版職務時，每周會撰寫兩篇社評，但於擔任上述職位後，黎智英認為他應該減少寫社評，於是改為每周一篇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於張志偉則為蘋果動新聞平台總監，負責動新聞製作，以及網上非新聞類的內容，包括娛樂、副刊、馬經及波經。他同時負責《蘋果》旗下的社交媒體帳戶，包括 Facebook、Instagram、Twitter、YouTube、PSCP.TV，以及網上直播。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又指，楊清奇為《蘋果日報》主筆，會以筆名「李平」撰寫社評，同時負責管理紙媒及網上的評論文章，需要審批稿件及聯絡作者，邀請對方寫稿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指楊清奇按黎的編採指示審批文章-形容黎追求民主自由反極權&quot;&gt;張指楊清奇按黎的編採指示審批文章 形容黎追求民主自由反極權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問張是否知道楊審批的準則，張表示楊會「按住黎智英定下嘅編採同評論政策」，即其編採指示審批文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到何謂「黎智英的編採指示」，張回答指黎的形象「一直以來都好鮮明」，即追求「民主、自由，同埋反極權」，特別是2019年反修例事件開始，黎智英認為政府對香港的民主自由存在打壓，並認為要透過《蘋果日報》去呼籲市民上街、示威及抗爭，以向政府施壓。此外，在國際層面上，黎希望獲得西方民主國家的關注，「希望佢哋能夠提供援助，甚至一啲強烈啲嘅行動，好似制裁。」張又指，上述《蘋果日報》高層的職位均由黎指派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告黎智英（76歲）否認一項「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」及兩項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英的律師團隊包括資深大律師彭耀鴻和大律師 Marc Corlett、關文渭、黃雅斌、董皓哲及李峰琦。3間蘋果日報公司清盤人由大律師王國豪代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、署理助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官吳加悅及陳穎琛等代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案8名被告：前行政總裁張劍虹、前總編輯羅偉光、前副社長陳沛敏、前執行總編輯林文宗、前英文主筆馮偉光、前主筆楊清奇、李宇軒和陳梓華，早前已承認「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，現正還柙，等待黎智英審訊完畢後判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（17日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第11日審訊。控方傳召認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。張提到，黎智英透過每週召開的「飯盒會」，向《蘋果》高層下達編採方面的指示。他指由《蘋果》創刊至2014年佔中之前，《蘋果》基本上予人印象是「狗仔隊、娛樂」，後來黎投入參與佔中，自此積極制訂編採政策，因而成為了《蘋果》的分水嶺，「好似成為一間反政府、對抗中央嘅一個報紙。」2019年政府提出修訂《逃犯條例》，黎亦曾向管理層稱修例侵犯香港人的民主自由和人權，並擔心倘通過修例「傳媒都冇得做」，所以認為要透過《蘋果》呼籲市民上街抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹午休後簡述蘋果日常運作-列出各種會議&quot;&gt;張劍虹午休後簡述蘋果日常運作 列出各種會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早開始傳召首名證人、已認罪的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹出庭作供，他上午交代其在壹傳媒集團的工作經驗，下午則開始談及《蘋果日報》的日常運作。張作供期間，被告欄內的黎智英不時手執原子筆和記事本抄寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹供稱，營辦一份報紙牽涉很多新聞材料，要在當中揀選角度及決定「做幾大」，乃涉及整個《蘋果日報》的編採政策，所以他們的日常運作過程中，每天都需要召開不同會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指每日下午2時半有一個「鋤報會」，出席的同事包括陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗，以及各部門主管，會議目的是檢討當天已出版的實體報紙，審視內容、標題有何不足及需要改進的地方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，每日下午3時則有一個「初會」，出席的人包括陳沛敏、林文宗、羅偉光，亦有不同部門的主管，包括突發新聞、港聞、國際、兩岸、法庭及財經等。會議由陳沛敏主持，各部門主管會匯報當天有哪些新聞發生，而陳則會從中揀選一些新聞，指示同事如何繼續跟進及「做詳細啲、豐富啲」。張又指，上述牽涉《蘋果日報》的編採政策，由管理層按照黎智英的指示而訂立。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、前《蘋果日報》副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，每日下午大概5時至5時半有一個「編前會」，主要決定翌日出版的實體報紙頭版，以及港聞版每頁的頭條。出席者包括陳沛敏和林文宗，但張不肯定羅偉光是否出席者之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，《蘋果日報》逢周二都會舉辦一次「Planning 會」，出席者包括陳沛敏、林文宗、羅偉光及各部門主管，由陳主持會議。各部門主管會報告手上有什麼新聞材料及正在跟進什麼專題，而陳、林和羅會向一眾部門主管下達黎智英的指示，包括有哪些「故仔」可以跟進、吩咐他們如何準備。此外，《蘋果》主筆楊清奇會報告星期六的論壇版會有什麼專題，同樣是按照黎的立場而定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張表示，他通常不會出席上述會議，而據他所知，黎智英亦沒有出席這些會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹稱黎智英透過飯盒會下達編採指示&quot;&gt;張劍虹稱黎智英透過「飯盒會」下達編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎智英如何下達編採方面的指示，張劍虹指會透過召開「飯盒會」。每逢星期四，黎會輪流與《蘋果日報》、《壹週刊》、《飲食男女》、廣告部等舉行「飯盒會」，例如今個星期與《蘋果日報》團隊開會，下周便會與《壹週刊》團隊開會，接著下周則是《飲食男女》團隊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就《蘋果日報》的「飯盒會」，張指由黎主持，其他出席者包括他自己、壹傳媒集團財務總裁周達權、資訊科技部主管Connie Chan、陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗，以及陳邀請的部門主管，每次與會者人數有10至15人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，由於「飯盒會」逢星期四舉行，所以早於星期一或二，有意出席的同事會加入黎智英設立的聊天群組，若有任何想法或問題可在群組內提出，屆時黎會在「飯盒會」中現身解答。張指會議之前，眾人會在壹傳媒大樓的飯堂買飯盒，然後於下午12時半前往5樓的貴賓房，一邊吃飯盒一邊參與會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，黎在會議期間會談及對時局的看法、其政治取態，以及在當時形勢底下《蘋果日報》的編採政策，讓與會人士再下達給沒有出席會議的管理層，之後各人會各司其職。張稱黎指示他做會議記錄，另會吩咐他跟進某些工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，黎不只參與會議，更是制訂編採政策的角色，問張是否正確。張確認，因黎是《蘋果日報》的創辦人，也是最大股東，持有超過70%股權。張亦形容黎是《蘋果日報》的「舵手」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹2014年黎智英投入佔中運動-蘋果成反政府報紙&quot;&gt;張劍虹：2014年黎智英投入佔中運動 《蘋果》成反政府報紙&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹表示，他記得由《蘋果日報》創刊至2014年佔中運動之前，黎智英比較少參與《蘋果》的編採工作。「當時基本上好多人都認為《蘋果日報》嘅形象都係狗仔隊、娛樂」，直至2014年佔中前後，「黎生就好積極咁制訂《蘋果日報》的編採政策。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，黎當時要求用《蘋果日報》去呼籲市民爭取民主、上街抗爭，「嗰時我好記得，要推動6.22公投，啫係爭取『我要真普選』，反對白皮書吖。」（註：2014年國務院發表的《一國兩制在香港的實踐》白皮書）張提到當時有一首歌曲改編自電影《孤星淚》歌曲，《蘋果》曾找人演唱，黎亦獻唱了一、兩句。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;後來2014年9月佔中爆發，張形容「黎生亦都好投入呢個佔中運動」，「我覺得呢件事係一個分水嶺，《蘋果日報》呢就好似成為一間反政府、對抗中央嘅一個報紙。」張指「由嗰時開始《蘋果日報》就行緊呢條路」，管理層亦跟從黎智英這個方向去經營這份報紙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英憂倘通過修例-傳媒都冇得做-冀透過蘋果籲上街&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英憂倘通過修例 「傳媒都冇得做」 冀透過《蘋果》籲上街&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行提及2019年的香港社會騷亂，問張事件有否影響《蘋果》的編採方向。張表示有影響，當政府宣布修訂《逃犯條例》後，黎智英會向高層說「《逃犯條例》啫係侵犯香港人嘅民主自由，同埋香港人嘅人權」，並認為「中共要透過呢個條例，將唔聽話嘅人，同中共政權嘅眼中釘送返大陸」。黎又提到「商界都好擔心」，並指若然修例通過，「傳媒都冇得做」，「所以黎生認為要透過《蘋果日報》叫啲人上街、抗爭。」在國際層面，黎亦認為要透過《蘋果》呼籲西方民主國家關注修例事件，希望他們出手對抗中央，甚至制裁香港官員，務求「等佢哋唔敢亂嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張補充，黎於2019年3至4月期間，除了在「飯盒會」談及過上述言論，亦曾在張的辦公室房間內說過相同言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹蘋論作者須經黎智英批准才能聘用&quot;&gt;張劍虹：「蘋論」作者須經黎智英批准才能聘用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於評論文章，張劍虹指黎智英同樣有下達指示，因新聞報導和評論的方針均是一致。張指《蘋果》社論一定要根據黎訂立的方向去撰寫，而刊於評論版的文章則由楊清奇負責審批。楊亦是按照黎的編採方向批核稿件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「社論」和「評論版」之間的分別，張指社論即是「蘋論」，每日均在一個專欄刊出，共有4名寫手，分別為馮偉光（筆名盧峯）、楊清奇（筆名李平）、方圓和古立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張提到，黎智英會就社論寫手人選給予建議，並會把一些寫得好及符合其方向的作者介紹給楊清奇。其中方圓乃由黎介紹，因他的文章多是批評政府和「反共」，黎認為方圓對中國共產黨熟悉，所以文章寫得好。由於社論作者必須經黎的批准才能聘用，所以從未試過社論作者不符合黎的指示的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而評論版則由不同的作者撰寫文章，內容比較多元化，不過「評論版」與「蘋論」一樣均刊載於「A疊（港聞版）」。楊清奇負責審批文章，當中部份作者由楊邀約，有的則由黎介紹，張自己也會不時介紹適合人選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱，他在2020年曾向楊清奇建議邀約一名日本人撰寫評論文章，惟一時記不起該日本人的名字。由於該日本人曾經訪問過黎智英，二人互相認識，他的文章亦有批評政府和談及日本的政治鬥爭，所以張認為他適合在供稿予《蘋果》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英專欄文章-冇人敢修改&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英專欄文章 「冇人敢修改」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎智英的專欄「成敗樂一笑」，張指它每逢星期日出版，但不是刊登於港聞的評論版，而是刊登於副刊的專欄版。他形容黎的文章「一般都係反共同批評政府」，但因為楊清奇不需負責審批副刊的專欄文章，所以不需要處理黎的專欄文章，除非黎要求其文章刊登於港聞的評論版，但這情況只發生過一、兩次。張又補充：「可以咁講，黎生嘅文係冇人敢修改。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gfsn9Fk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（16日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第10日審訊。辯方反對控方專家、香港城市大學法律學院教授王貴國的兩份專家報告呈堂，因認為與本案控罪元素無關。3名《國安法》指定法官考慮控辯雙方陳詞後，認為王貴國的證供有助法庭了解美國針對中港官員而實施的措施，以及提供足夠資訊予法庭判斷相關措施是否能夠構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」，最終批准兩份專家報告呈堂。控方表示，明天將會傳召首名證人，預料主問需時一星期。據悉首名證人為前蘋果日報社長張劍虹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方反對專家報告呈堂-稱黎涉案行為與外國措施沒有因果關係&quot;&gt;辯方反對專家報告呈堂 稱黎涉案行為與外國措施沒有因果關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方擬引用香港城市大學法律學院教授王貴國分別於2022年11月17日及2023年11月15日撰寫的兩份報告，以圖列出美國針對中港官員而實施的制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為，以及解釋相關措施的法律效力，包括影響、後果和時效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方代表、大律師關文渭則反對報告呈堂，並指它對於本案沒有足夠關聯，因黎智英的涉案行為與報告提及的外國措施之間並沒有因果關係，例如《香港人權及民主法案》於2019年下半年立法，比兩項串謀勾結外國勢力控罪時段更加早。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰則認為，當外國政府聲稱會實施制裁，並不代表相關措施構成「制裁」，法庭需要王貴國的專家證供，去判斷外國採取或立法的措施是否構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」。李官澄清，王貴國的報告並未有評論黎智英的言論或請求，因此與黎的犯案意圖無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;報告提及外國措施立法過程-辯方質疑轉移焦點&quot;&gt;報告提及外國措施立法過程 辯方質疑轉移焦點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭續指，王貴國提交的補充報告提及《香港人權及民主法案》影響香港的利益，他質疑這部份何以與措施是否「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」有關係。關又指，報告闡述外國措施的立法過程和背景，可是既然外國立法並不是因為黎智英的言行所致，這些資料僅轉移焦點（red herring），並不能協助法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰則指，專家報告是否能協助到法庭，最終可交由法庭決定。法官李運騰則指，法庭需要一名專家的協助，以了解這些外國措施的法律效力和後續影響，否則難以知道它們是否構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」。關文渭則指這與控罪元素無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行則表示，他們並非依賴王貴國的證供去證明黎的行為導致外國採取制裁措施。但控方指相關因果關係乃依賴「共犯證人」的庭上證供。控方重申王貴國的專家報告能夠協助法庭理解外國的措施是否構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官批准王貴國專家報告呈堂&quot;&gt;官批准王貴國專家報告呈堂&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經休庭約一小時考慮，由法官李運騰讀出裁決，他指王貴國的專家報告與本案相關，批准呈堂。控辯雙方均不爭議王貴國是一名美國法律專家，至於報告提及美國以外的其他國家，控方則不會依賴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，兩項串謀勾結外國勢力控罪均是「串謀」請求外國實施制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為，而控方並不需要證明外國實際上有實施相關措施。若然真的有任何外國措施擬訂立或實行，那只是環境證據，協助控方證明涉案「串謀」存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指專家證供的作用在於告知法庭外國法律的內容，以及在有需要時解釋外國法院如何解讀相關法律，因此法官接納控方所指，外國法律的事實部份有待專家證供證明。法官認為王貴國的證供有助法庭了解美國針對中港官員而實施的措施，以及提供足夠資訊予法庭判斷相關措施是否能夠構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又提到，現階段只需處理專家報告是否可以呈堂，而不需處理證據比重，至於法庭最終是否接納王貴國的證供則有待決定。假如法庭最終認為王的證供無助他們判斷，他們便不會予以考慮。基於以上，3名法官批准王的專家報告呈堂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英的律師團隊包括資深大律師彭耀鴻和大律師 Marc Corlett、關文渭、黃雅斌、董皓哲及李峰琦。3間蘋果日報公司清盤人由大律師王國豪代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、署理助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官吳加悅及陳穎琛等代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案8名被告：前行政總裁張劍虹、前總編輯羅偉光、前副社長陳沛敏、前執行總編輯林文宗、前英文主筆馮偉光、前主筆楊清奇、李宇軒和陳梓華，早前已承認「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，現正還柙，等待黎智英審訊完畢後判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
