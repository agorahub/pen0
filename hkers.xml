&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, successive British governments have sought to emphasise that a post-Brexit UK would be outward looking, collaborative and influential. A series of speeches and policy statements stressed that the UK would pursue future prosperity through overseas engagements built upon investments in diplomacy, trade, defence and development aid. In March 2021, the UK government published its Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy, reiterating these themes and referencing Eastern Africa as a part of the world where the UK would increase its engagement, with explicit references to Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A RUSI research project, “Furthering Global Britain? Reviewing the Foreign Policy Effect of UK Engagement in East Africa”, has examined whether, and how, the UK has leveraged international development, defence and diplomatic investments as envisaged. For the four above-mentioned countries, the project analysed the UK’s core engagements from 2015 to 2022. Through key informant interviews and literature analysis, it identified factors that helped or hindered the UK in pursuing an integrated and collaborative foreign policy approach, and tested perceptions of the UK. The effects of major structural changes to UK foreign policy since 2015 were also studied, notably reducing the overseas aid budget, merging two ministries to create the new Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office (FCDO), and leaving the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper provides background on recent UK policy towards the region, summarising the project’s research findings, and offers recommendations for the UK government with relevance both to the region and to an integrated foreign policy globally. The key findings are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the face of volatility, the UK has had to adapt its approach towards the region numerous times since 2015. Actions include reallocating funding towards drought relief, suspending cooperation during conflict and political upheaval (Sudan), condemning reported war crimes (Ethiopia), bolstering stabilisation efforts in the wake of new military offensives (Somalia) and providing support to mitigate electoral instability (Kenya and Somalia).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite inconsistent levels of political leadership, the UK contributed to relatively successful outcomes across the four case study countries. However, these are not sufficient (or necessarily sustainable) in isolation and continue to face important constraints and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attempts by UK officials to better integrate defence, international development and diplomatic work have made progress.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the abolition of the UK Department for International Development (DFID) is regretted by some UK regional partners, the unplanned creation of the FCDO shows early promise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK retains a good reputation in the region for the calibre of its diplomats and development and defence experts, and has broadly maintained staffing levels in the region, despite budget cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK is reasonably well regarded as a development, defence and diplomatic actor across the region. However, despite this, a range of middle and great powers increasingly offer alternative forms of support to East African governments, which contributes to perceptions of declining UK influence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK has established relationships and partnerships with a variety of actors. It often operates effectively through ad hoc groupings of bilateral and multilateral networks in the region and globally, bolstered by envoys and technical specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between 2019 and 2021, the UK bilateral aid budget was reduced by around 50% across the region. External relationships suffered, as funding decisions were arrived at iteratively and were not always well communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brexit did not significantly impair the UK’s operational effectiveness in the region, but alongside other factors it probably contributed to a perception of declining influence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UK strategies at the country level were sometimes unclear, overly broad or outpaced by contextual changes. The lack of a regional strategy also remains a significant gap, given the transnational nature of the opportunities and challenges facing Eastern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research raises important questions concerning the nature of UK–Africa relations and the role of aid, development and defence engagement within an integrated foreign policy. Various recommendations are offered in this paper, spanning operational and strategic levels. These include building on lessons from the DFID–Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office merger to ensure the FCDO’s capabilities fully support integrated ways of working; better aligning mission priorities across the Gulf and Eastern Africa; and bolstering cooperation between special envoys and embassy-level staff. Explicit change management processes must be used to guide further organisational reform. More broadly, the UK should advocate for a clearer mandate when it comes to ad hoc groups such as the Quint and the Quad; centre long-term, sustainable engagement; and communicate the scope, scale and mechanics of continuing UK–EU cooperation to help defuse perceptions of an isolated, post-Brexit foreign policy, particularly to local audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly in a world of increased geopolitical rivalry, the UK needs to clarify its positioning towards Africa. Policy statements in favour of “integration” or “partnerships”, while useful, do not in themselves constitute effective strategy. With a contracting resource base, positive results may become harder to demonstrate in an increasingly competitive, transactional environment. African governments also now have a wider array of potential partners and greater leverage in shaping foreign engagement. As a result, the UK will need to market its added value towards Africa very clearly. As a first step, a two-way dialogue should be established with African partners at government and societal level to discuss shared priorities and ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, successive British governments have emphasised that a post-Brexit UK would be outward looking, collaborative and influential. They portrayed the UK as pursuing future prosperity through overseas engagements built upon investments in diplomacy, trade, defence and development aid. Following this trend, the UK government published an ambitious policy document, the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy (IR21) in March 2021, expressing similar sentiments about the UK’s role in the world while pointing to the challenge of increased geopolitical competition. Greater connectivity was promised between UK diplomacy, defence, trade and international development, alongside the UK working with like-minded governments towards shared goals of prosperity, democracy and security. East Africa, an area of longstanding UK interest, was among the regions prioritised for engagement, with explicit references to Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A RUSI research project “Furthering Global Britain? Reviewing the Foreign Policy Effect of UK Engagement in East Africa” has examined whether, and how, the UK has leveraged international development, defence and diplomatic investments as envisaged. For the four above-mentioned countries, the project analysed the UK’s core engagements from 2015 to 2022, identifying factors that helped or hindered its pursuit of an integrated and collaborative foreign policy approach, as well as testing perceptions of the UK. The effects of major structural changes to UK foreign policy since 2015 were also studied, notably reducing the overseas aid budget, merging two ministries to create the new Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office (FCDO), and leaving the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper provides background on recent UK policy towards the region, summarising the project’s research findings, and offers recommendations for the UK government with relevance both to East Africa and to an integrated foreign policy globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research methodology consisted of a review of selected policy literature and 182 semi-structured expert interviews carried out from mid-2021 to early 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literature Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A review was undertaken of official data and policy documents from government departments (principally the Ministry of Defence (MoD), the FCDO and the now-defunct Department for International Development (DFID)); parliamentary committees and regulatory bodies (for example, the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee); associated funding platforms (for example, the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF), the Prosperity Fund, the Newton Fund and the Global Challenges Research Fund); and public entities such as the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI). Papers were analysed for key themes, sectoral engagement and expenditure that the UK continually or repeatedly adopted in its engagement in Eastern Africa. Data on UK aid, defence and diplomatic engagement in the four focal countries from 2015 to 2022 was used as a reference point to identify UK policy objectives and trends over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through semi-structured interviews, the team identified a number of key outcomes that the UK has sought to achieve in each of the focus countries, and which were informative in terms of the overarching research objectives. A range of actors who are familiar with UK engagement were then interviewed to understand the nature and significance of the UK contribution and the factors that had enabled or constrained engagement. A total of 182 interviews were carried out between September 2021 and January 2023, with a substantial number of them based in Eastern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the final paper in a series of publications stemming from this project, which includes a paper that lays out the project methodology and greater detail on UK investments across the region, and four country case studies focusing on the UK’s work in Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia and Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-background&quot;&gt;I. Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-context&quot;&gt;Policy Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “Global Britain” was first used by Prime Minister Theresa May as shorthand for an outward-looking, collaborative and influential agenda. Dramatic events and policy changes were to follow. Under the subsequent leadership of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a new government department, the FCDO, was announced in June 2020, merging the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) and DFID. Declared without prior planning, the process led to substantial and repeated rounds of restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2020, the UK official development assistance (ODA) budget was also cut, from 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) to 0.5%: a significant shift given that the UK had acquired a reputation overseas as a strong and generous aid donor since the 1990s. Some commentators lamented the end of the UK’s role as a global “development superpower”, claiming a loss of status and damage to partnerships and British influence. This stood in contrast to a well-publicised increase in the national defence budget. The government subsequently set out the conditions (fiscal tests) under which it intended to return the budget to 0.7% GNI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2021, the UK government published the IR21. The document recognised a more competitive global context than in 2016 but reiterated now-familiar “Global Britain” themes. It signalled a wish to play a proactive role in global affairs, to work in cooperation with others, particularly “like-minded bilateral and multilateral partners”, and to better integrate foreign policy, defence, trade and international development efforts. Africa was referenced in terms of forging problem-solving partnerships and the pursuit of prosperity, democracy and security. The policy spoke of maintaining commitments to Africa with respect to ODA, but leaned strongly towards promoting trade, economic resilience and the alignment of international development with wider foreign policy. In this context, East Africa was pegged as a specific region for continued, and in some cases increased, engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On defence matters, it included a commitment to “persistent engagement”, for example, placing UK armed forces overseas for longer periods in a more proactive posture. A series of sub-strategies were subsequently released, including the 2021 Defence Command Paper and the 2022 International Development Strategy. Highly pertinent for Africa, the latter situated international development as part of a broader effort to build a network of like-minded partners with “all our capabilities – our diplomatic influence, trade policy, defence, intelligence, business partnerships and development expertise”. In doing so, it signalled an intention to use aid for both poverty reduction and wider development and foreign policy goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “refreshed” version of IR21 was released – IR23 – in March 2023. Africa was again identified as a region where the UK government should deepen relationships: “The UK’s approach in Africa will continue to be defined by a greater appreciation of the needs and perspectives of key partners across the continent, focusing on mutually beneficial development, security and defence partnerships, and support for clean infrastructure and climate adaptation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IR23 also stated that the UK would “work to reinvigorate its position as a global leader on international development, pursuing patient, long-term partnerships tailored to the needs of the countries we work with, going beyond our Official Development Assistance (ODA) offer to draw on the full range of UK strengths and expertise”. Specific commitments included placing the Minister of State for Africa and International Development on the UK National Security Council (NSC), creating a new second permanent secretary role in the FCDO to oversee all UK development priorities, and establishing a new FCDO–Treasury governance structure to supervise all aid spending. The minister would subsequently clarify his own agenda for the future of UK international development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, the UK policy context has evolved considerably over the research period. Transitions between prime ministers Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, and foreign secretaries Dominic Raab, Liz Truss and James Cleverly, linked to the politics of Brexit and Covid-19, and sometimes accompanied by claims of incompetence or corruption, have also brought shifting priorities and tone. Prolonged Brexit negotiations, the Covid-19 pandemic, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have also reshaped geopolitics and economics, with significant knock-on implications for UK spending plans as political attention and increasingly scarce resources were either diverted away from East Africa or towards more short-term crisis management. With already reduced levels of UK ODA diverted towards meeting refugee assistance costs domestically, aid spending in Eastern Africa is much lower than anticipated, despite the region facing severe drought and significant political, security and economic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uk-regional-policy-priorities-and-engagements&quot;&gt;UK Regional Policy Priorities and Engagements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK engagement with Eastern Africa is multifaceted, with a long history. A non-exhaustive list of topics of concern include security and counterterrorism (Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and previously Ethiopia), migration (especially Sudan), humanitarian relief, stabilisation and conflict resolution (Sudan, Somalia), international development, climate and environment and trade (especially Kenya). This paper is informed by five preceding research papers. Taken together these provide details on country contexts, UK investments, objectives and selective outcomes across the region. A brief overview of the UK’s key interests, policy priorities and engagements in each country from 2015 to 2022 is also provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government considers Ethiopia one of a handful of high-priority countries for UK engagement in Africa due to its size, influence and strategic location. Successive UK governments have sought a stable Ethiopia that is supportive of their foreign policy priorities both globally, especially the international development agenda, but also in the Horn of Africa, for example, with regard to the War on Terror and migration and in relation to the stability of Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan. Given that it is one of the largest refugee-hosting countries in Africa and the world, the UK sees Ethiopia as a key country for stemming onward migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Registering an annual growth rate of over 10% between 2004 and 2009, in the mid-2000s Ethiopia acted as a cheerleader for international development in global forums. Seeing Ethiopia as a quintessential “developmental state”, the UK became a staunch partner. Via the now-defunct DFID, the UK aligned strongly with the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front’s (EPRDF) development agenda. Ethiopia at times became the largest single recipient of UK bilateral aid globally, much of it channelled via the government in support of service delivery. Expenditure averaged around £220 million per annum between 2016 and 2020. This made the UK the second-largest donor after the US, contributing around 11% of Ethiopia’s recorded aid income as reported via the OECD–Development Assistance Committee (DAC). Alongside investments in areas ranging from human rights to economic development and drought response, approximately 60% of the UK’s bilateral aid budget has typically been channelled via central government programmes, the bulk allocated to multi-donor, multi-year funds that supported delivery of basic services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In IR21, the UK planned to work in partnership with Ethiopia “to further our shared prosperity goals, our democratic values and our security interests” and to invest in “regional stability, moving towards closer defence cooperation”. But cuts to the UK aid budget and the changing context in Ethiopia dictated otherwise. By 2021, UK bilateral spend had roughly halved compared to 2019. The remaining (£120-million) UK bilateral aid allocation to Ethiopia in 2021 was £134 million lower than the year before. This was the largest cut – in absolute, though not proportional terms – of any country budget worldwide. Reductions were accompanied by reallocations to different sectors in light of a series of natural disasters, shifting ministerial priorities, Covid-19 and the Tigray War. In 2020, the UK spent £254 million in bilateral ODA in Ethiopia. Humanitarian aid (£103 million) accounted for approximately 40% of the budget as compared to 15% in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some criticism, the UK has attempted to position itself as constructively critical of Ethiopian government actions during its war in Tigray, while continuing with reduced aid programming via government channels. Meanwhile, it has lobbied the federal government repeatedly for humanitarian access and respect for international humanitarian law, and provided humanitarian funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government has maintained a relationship with the Ethiopian Ministry of National Defence for over two decades and has a permanent defence attaché in-country. Defence-related expenditure typically runs at under £1 million per annum, mostly drawn from regional budgets with competing priorities, including the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). Ethiopia’s support to AMISOM was the UK’s principal focus – many AMISOM troops have received training from the UK. Levels of UK ambition on security and defence issues have, however, declined over time. Ethiopia and the UK cooperated on counterterrorism issues, but the focus has mainly been on education and training in non-combat areas linked to the Ethiopian Peace Support Training Centre since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as supporting international development work, UK diplomatic interest has historically focused on issues above, ranging from trade promotion to migration, counterterrorism cooperation and Ethiopian involvement in peacekeeping. Considerable energy has also been absorbed on consular cases involving dual nationals. Diplomatic relations were tested in early to mid-2021, as Western criticisms of the Ethiopian government blockade of Tigray and reported human rights abuses led to recriminations. The UK has pursued a lower-profile approach to the Tigray War compared with more prominent critics (for example, the EU, Ireland and the US), who briskly paused aid packages and publicly condemned Ethiopian government actions. It has attempted to position itself as constructively critical while continuing to send aid via government. Amid a turbulent context that included war in Tigray and an intense government counterinsurgency campaign in Oromia, the UK has sought diplomatic engagement with the Ethiopian federal government at the highest level. With respect to Tigray, it lobbied for improved humanitarian access, ceasefires and talks. It has not invested high levels of political capital, however, with infrequent senior ministerial visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somalia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK was the second-largest DAC donor country to Somalia after the US between 2011 and 2020. A significant proportion of this bilateral aid has been channelled towards government assistance and structural reform, public financial management and support for subnational administration. This includes strengthening the building blocks of the Federal Government of Somalia’s (FGS) legitimacy and accountability, from funding judicial development and service provision to supporting inclusive commercial growth. Given the ongoing threat of Al-Shabaab and jihadist militancy, long-running investments were also allocated to security sector reform and law enforcement, with UK personnel leading the policing strand of Somalia’s Comprehensive Approach to Security framework and supporting projects on stabilisation and countering violent extremism/deradicalisation. Efforts were likewise made to facilitate a political settlement at the federal level and to bolster humanitarian assistance. Resources peaked in famine or near-famine years (2011/12 and 2017/18), with food security (as a sub-stream of “humanitarian preparedness and response”) emphasised as a thematic priority in IR21, supplementing resilience programmes to improve early-warning systems, coping mechanisms, local self-reliance and access to healthcare services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In-country budgets saw a 56% contraction between 2020 and 2021. Although Somalia is still one of the top 10 recipients of British ODA, this put the UK below Germany’s bilateral aid spending level for the first time. The cuts came alongside a depreciating exchange rate and reallocations driven by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Although funding for famine relief remains comparatively high, only £61 million in humanitarian aid, healthcare and nutritional resourcing was provided in FY2022/23. This reflected a sharp decrease from the £170-million package offered in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK diplomacy has focused on “supporting and occasionally steering multilateral efforts to build up the FGS’s political anatomy, authority and capacity”. Having co-hosted or facilitated several international conferences to formalise the federal structure and provisional constitution, from 2017 UK attention increasingly shifted towards developing a basic security framework and delivering the 2018–22 Somalia Transition Plan (STP). In tandem with the US, London backed the World Bank’s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief process (2016), and – alongside other donors – helped the FGS satisfy the “Decision Point” benchmarks by 2020. As UN Security Council (UNSC) penholder, the UK also facilitated debate over the structuring, resourcing and timing of AMISOM (now the African Transition Mission – ATMIS), and contributed significant funding to the UN Office for Project Services and the AMISOM Trust Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to develop a self-sufficient security apparatus capable of degrading Al-Shabaab was referenced in both the UK’s 2015 National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review and the 2021 Defence Command Paper. In recent years, the British Army has supplied infrastructural projects and training, stipends and equipment to the Somali National Army (SNA) under Operation Tangham, primarily for Sector 60 of the army, based around Baidoa. UK-funded advisers remain embedded across federal institutions, including in the ministries of defence and internal security. The focus continues to be on reforming and capacitating national forces so that they can assume security responsibilities from ATMIS as the mission sets to conclude in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sudan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has longstanding ties with the Republic of Sudan, previously a colonial condominium, and considers it one of a few high-priority countries on the continent. The view has been that worsening political and economic situations in Sudan would impact the Horn of Africa and North Africa and negatively affect the UK’s vital interests. The IR21 specifically mentioned the UK’s commitment to “continue to support conflict resolution and stabilisation efforts in … Sudan”. Outward migration has also been a concern. The UK is home to a significant and longstanding Sudanese diaspora (around 20,000 people). The UK Home Office has led efforts to curtail migration from Sudan through strengthened border management and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK bilateral aid commitments to Sudan averaged around £93 million per annum between 2016 and 2020. Recent ODA-funded programmes have contributed on issues from humanitarian relief and humanitarian system reform to economic reform, reducing female genital mutilation and child marriage, to water and sanitation, civil society, and supporting the Juba Peace Agreement (2020). The highest-expenditure items have been humanitarian relief and economic reform, and social safety net support. As UK aid contributions to neighbouring countries declined, the Sudan aid budget temporarily rose from £93 million in 2019 to £139 million in 2020. This was due to a one-off increase for a new “Sudan Family Support Programme”, the UK contribution to a World Bank-run programme designed to cushion the needy from economic reforms. Alongside this, the UK campaigned hard at the World Bank and the IMF for Sudanese debt relief. Aid contributions were halted following the October 2021 coup. The UK, together with the US, World Bank and other major donors, suspended non-humanitarian aid. UK bilateral ODA funding dropped back to £93 million by the end of 2021. This still left Sudan as the fifth-largest recipient of UK bilateral ODA worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Sudan’s long period of military rule and the existence of UK, UN and EU sanctions regimes, opportunities for defence engagement have been few. UK–Sudan defence engagement was completely suspended following the October 2021 coup, and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) withdrew its defence attaché from Khartoum in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s Sudan diplomacy has focused over time on issues ranging from peace negotiations to migration, counterterrorism and humanitarian access, to the imposition of sanctions and the work of the International Criminal Court (ICC). As a follow-on to involvement in the negotiations for the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the UK acted as “penholder” for the UN hybrid mission in Darfur (UNAMID) and its successor, the UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS). In March 2016, a UK–Sudan Strategic Dialogue was set up – a formalised contact forum in which senior officials from the two countries met under the shadow of UK and multilateral sanctions. Economic sanctions under UN and EU auspices were central to UK policy in the hope of incentivising reduced conflict, given previous allegations of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the early 2000s. The UK was also involved in establishing the Khartoum Process, a controversial intergovernmental dialogue platform to facilitate cooperation on migration. Particularly since the ousting of President Omar Al-Bashir, UK ambassadors have been prominent voices in support of democratic transition, often working with the US and Norway “Troika”. UK diplomacy also played an important role in the June–July 2019 “Quartet” negotiations that produced a civilian-led, transitional government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempts to facilitate an agreement between key political and security factions after the 2021 military coup culminated in the December 2022 “Framework Agreement”, a deal brokered by UNITAMS, the Inter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African Union (AU) and backed by, among others, the UK. Despite these efforts, fighting again broke out in Khartoum on 15 April 2023. Violence subsequently spread, leading to reports of war crimes and mass displacement, especially in Darfur. While the UK and other foreign governments initially focused on evacuating nationals and calling for ceasefires and restraint, competing diplomatic tracks have gradually coalesced over time. The US and Saudi Arabia, for instance, convened talks in Jeddah but were criticised for failing to coordinate with other Quad members (including the UK) or regional organisations such as the AU. Although a temporary truce was brokered in late May, the deal – like many others before and since – collapsed under repeated violations. Separately, an IGAD summit was hosted in July, rivalling AU leadership claims over any mediation process, and bilateral and multilateral arrangements fronted by Chad and Egypt started pushing their own initiatives. The result has been “disarray” and confusion, “posing the risk that opportunities [for peace-making] will slip away unexplored”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kenya&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya has been an enduring priority for UK engagement in Africa since the country’s independence in 1963, reflecting a relationship grounded on shared history, language, economic ties, diasporic networks and security needs. Name-checked in IR21 and the International Development Strategy, these linkages were formalised by the 2020–25 Strategic Partnership, with bilateral interests spanning mutual prosperity; regional stability; sustainable development and reduction of extreme poverty; collaborative leadership on climate and environmental issues; peer learning, knowledge sharing and research; and the expansion of individual and institutional networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eclipsed by the US in the mid-1970s, the UK’s bilateral ODA contributions to Kenya averaged around £117 million between 2016 and 2020, peaking at £152.8 million in 2017 before falling below those of Japan in 2018, and France and EU institutions in 2020, and Germany a year later. Partially tied to the drop from 0.7% to 0.5% of GNI, the government’s in-country budget reduced from £134 million (2019) to £72 million (2021) – roughly 46% over two years – slightly exceeding the 42% cut across Africa as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of coverage and content, social infrastructure has regularly consumed the largest proportion of UK ODA funding, although the specific distribution has varied over time. Support for social protection and education, for instance, diminished in 2013/14, while investment in health systems grew steadily from 2017 and extended further as part of the COVAX vaccine rollout. Attention has likewise been paid to multi-sector work – particularly environmental protections, policies and administrative management – and humanitarian aid, including emergency (drought and flood) relief, and refugee support and empowerment. After the outbreak of electoral (and state) violence in 2007/8, the UK increased its focus on governance, peace and security issues. Additional resourcing was also channelled towards improving the accountability of public institutions, anti-corruption efforts, conflict mitigation and reducing the risk of radicalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History has proven both a “benefit and burden” for diplomatic engagement. The UK retains close ties to Kenya’s political, military and economic elite, but has often been scapegoated when politically expedient. Following then-candidate Uhuru Kenyatta’s indictment by the ICC in 2013, for example, elements of Kenyatta’s Jubilee party were able to dismiss Western criticism as “neo-colonial”, refusing any renewal of UK defence cooperation and accelerating his predecessor’s “look east” strategy. While relations gradually improved, culminating in a prime ministerial visit by Theresa May in 2018, similar issues emerged over successive electoral cycles (2017 and 2022), revealing the difficult dynamics that UK officials continue to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary relations with Nairobi are also wrapped up in UK commercial interests. Kenya is the largest African recipient of British “aid-for-trade” programming, and significant efforts are being made to boost environmental, social and corporate standards. In 2020, an Economic Partnership Agreement pledged funds to boost trade and granted Kenyans “duty and quota free” access to UK markets, although there were concerns such bilateral arrangements could disrupt regional integration within the East Africa Community, or saturate local markets with cheap imports. In 2021, Kenya was considered a priority country in British International Investment (BII)’s $1-billion pan-African suite of infrastructure, finance and climate projects, supplementing assistance to 30 regional funds and more than 80 local finance, tech and green enterprises. Later that year, then foreign secretary Dominic Raab declared a further £132 million in public and private funding aligned with Kenyatta’s “Big Four Agenda”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has long considered Kenya an “essential” defence partner, as the country hosts significant British military assets and infrastructure, adjoins Somalia, South Sudan and Ethiopia, and offers a logistical corridor to central Africa. Much of this relationship is framed by the Security Compact, an arrangement approved in 2015 (and episodically updated) covering countering violent extremism, border and aviation policing, and criminal justice cooperation, alongside efforts to tackle instability and conflict. Defence Cooperation Agreements were also signed in 2016 and 2021, renewing the legal instruments that maintain BATUK (the British Army Training Unit Kenya, host of the multinational Askari Storm exercises) and allow capacity building with the Kenyan Defence Forces (KDF). In addition, BPST-A (the British Peace Support Team) advises and assists African militaries, supporting peacekeeping operations such as AMISOM and ATMIS, and working with partners including the International Peace Support Training Centre to strengthen institutional learning and regional responses to complex emergencies. In recent years, Kenya was designated a “regional hub” in the MoD’s “persistent engagement strategy”, with the 2021 Defence Command Paper prescribing a further expansion of UK commitments and the continuation of joint training and readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-research-findings&quot;&gt;II. Research Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project’s most prominent findings from all source data across the four case studies – including secondary source and interview data – are provided below. Where relevant, recommendations are offered for UK policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-1&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the face of volatility, the UK has had to adapt its approach towards the region numerous times since 2015. Actions include reallocating funding towards drought relief, suspending cooperation during conflict and political upheaval (Sudan), condemning reported war crimes (Ethiopia), bolstering stabilisation efforts (Somalia), and providing support to mitigate electoral instability (Kenya and Somalia).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kenya offers relative stability, commercial opportunities and a good degree of judicial independence. But the economy has struggled to recover from Covid-19-era restrictions and global price increases. Political and ethnic divisions persist, and state systems are not meeting public expectations amid corruption, inequality and the high cost of living. Against this backdrop, the UK has dedicated significant time, diplomatic capital and financial resources to electoral support and institution building to help consolidate reforms prescribed in Kenya’s 2010 Constitution. With contested polls (and an eventual re-run) in 2017, the British High Commission (BHC) doubled down on its supply of technical assistance across various regulatory bodies such as the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, despite increasing contextual difficulties. Crucially, early engagement in the electoral cycle bought time for participatory planning and networking, enabling British stakeholders to better navigate the stringent restrictions imposed on donors by Kenya’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At the same time, the BHC assumed an influential role in coordinating external engagement, partially facilitated by its unusual levels of access to local institutions; the longevity and depth of bilateral UK ties to Kenya; the coincidental absence of a US ambassador; and the High Commissioner’s personal clout. Much of this leadership was “behind the scenes”, with the UK contributing towards the donor agenda while reportedly sharing or ceding ownership to mitigate the political sensitivities previously disrupting British interventions in 2013 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visible changes to Ethiopia’s existing political settlement began in 2018 with the dissolution of the ruling EPRDF. The UK enjoyed a close working relationship with the Ethiopian government until 2019, cooperating and financing significant poverty reduction efforts and pursuing shared counterterrorism objectives, despite worsening political divisions and insecurity. This began to change following the November 2020 Tigray War and subsequent security and economic crisis. The UK attempted to maintain access to newly installed prime minister Abiy Ahmed’s government at the highest level while being critical of the conduct of the war. It continued to provide financial aid and technical assistance to government departments for socioeconomic development but at lower levels than before, while lobbying for humanitarian access to Tigray. Defence cooperation outside peacekeeping training was stopped. Yet by attempting to keep all options and channels open, the UK attracted criticism from both the Ethiopian federal government and pro-Tigrayan voices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somalia remains poor and insecure, with much of the country inaccessible to governmental and international actors. In working to support a “good enough” state capable of out-competing Al-Shabaab, the UK developed new (experimental) approaches to stabilisation in support of Operation Badbaado, an SNA-led offensive focused on the liberation of several “bridge-towns” across Lower Shabelle between 2019 and 2020. By shifting towards a more politically sensitive methodology based on grassroot reconciliation, dialogue and community buy-in – fronted in large part by the Early Recovery Initiative – the UK was able to build momentum for peace committees and recovery operations. Although primarily confined to the tactical level given a lack of follow-up funding and police coverage, these inputs were nevertheless considered “significant and influential” on their own terms, while plugging a gap in international programming. British engagement also proved flexible in reallocating resources to help avert the risk of famine in 2017, marking a substantial (if imperfect) improvement on similar interventions in 2011/12. Subsequent efforts in 2022 were, however, criticised as insufficient and under-financed, leveraging technical expertise and convening power in an enabler role, rather than exercising the leadership and multiplier effects evident five years previously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Sudan, the UK acquired a reputation over many years for careful diplomacy, even-handed dealings around the north–south conflict, and ongoing support for humanitarian relief. Under President Omar Al-Bashir, relations were highly challenging. The situation pivoted to a close working relationship with the brief hybrid transitional government of 2019–21. While ending cooperation on security and development matters, the UK maintained contact with key political and military figures even after the October 2021 coup. This caused some pro-democracy actors to criticise the UK’s support for “hybrid” or compromise agreements that featured the security services. While events have moved on with the outbreak of violence in April 2023, there is still a reservoir of goodwill towards the UK in Sudan and an appetite for increased engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rapidly changing context points to the importance of up-to-date multi-disciplinary analysis to inform decisions on strategy, action and difficult trade-offs. It also underscores that peace, adequate governance and security are fundamental for progress on other agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Make use of the combined skills and levers that exist across government – from trade-related to cultural, diplomatic and security – to develop and periodically update internal analysis of the political, security and economic situation in the region, and identify any levers for change that will permit effective UK action at country level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure that future UK international development strategies and white papers recognise the importance of addressing security, conflict and governance challenges to enable progress on development and prosperity objectives in East Africa and other fragile environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-2&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite inconsistent levels of political leadership, the UK contributed to relatively successful outcomes across the four case study countries. However, these are not sufficient (or necessarily sustainable) in isolation and continue to face important constraints and challenges.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on interviewees’ assessments of UK inputs and successes, several example focus areas emerged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Kenya, the UK displayed flexibility, contextual awareness and diplomatic influence in delivering well-timed, long-running electoral support (and subsequent crisis management). Together with other international partners and endogenous factors, these efforts helped strengthen trust and public safety during the largely peaceful 2022 election. Similarly, defence engagement fed into tactical, doctrinal and possibly operational improvements in the KDF, and ensured a persistent, close working relationship with Nairobi. UK programming was likewise able to draw on its networking and technical expertise to contribute to a boost in Kenyan literacy rates, academic performance and girls’ progression to secondary-level education. However, such experiences also reflect the inherent difficulty of engendering sustainable change across institutional cultures, especially when navigating political sensitivities and elite interests, leaving the longer-term and higher-level impact of UK interventions (often) unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incremental progress was made in Ethiopia, with the UK feeding into (and funding) plans to liberalise the agriculture, manufacturing, mining, tourism, and information and communications sectors, backed by international financial institution (IFI) loans. Partly as a result of embassy efforts and relationships, a consortium including UK firm Vodafone won a licence to operate in Ethiopia in a deal that aimed to catalyse investment and jobs in 2021, although wider liberalisation plans have since faltered. More fruitfully, the UK supported a peace initiative in Ethiopia’s Somali Region, with marginalised and aggrieved populations able to participate. Despite problems with implementation, the Asmara agreement of 2018 may have contributed for a time to reduced violence and improved stability, and facilitated the movement of goods into northern Kenya and Somaliland. This demonstrates how long-term, low-key investments, when combined with political savvy and a trusted implementing partner, can generate results.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Somalia, the UK remained an important international stakeholder, leveraging its financial sway in the World Bank’s Multi-Partner Fund, diplomatic capital as UNSC Penholder, and existing relationships with federal member states (FMS) authorities to help push through support for revenue generation, financial management and debt relief via the HIPC process. While donors may have downplayed or deferred corruption and accountability issues along the way, the effort to create administrative structures commensurate with the ambition of Somalia’s transition plans may be an important foundation. Programmes like the Early Recovery Initiative also appeared promising, providing innovative, dialogue-based stabilisation models to better address community needs and bolster FGS–FMS relations. Although experiencing a significant drop in resourcing compared to 2017, UK technical expertise and convening power likewise fed into ongoing efforts to supply famine relief – albeit not on the scale required. Nevertheless, the pernicious impact of economic extraversion and foreign dependency, and a lack of political unanimity among Somalis themselves, continue to hamper higher-level UK objectives, namely the development a durable federal state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite a chequered past, the UK has displayed significant leverage at key moments in Sudan, building on a long history of engagement. Supporting good practice around conflict sensitivity, localisation, transparency and resilience-building allowed British aid to assist more than two million people with food, cash, education, healthcare and water access between 2017 and 2022. Even by linking emergency relief and high-level diplomacy, the UK – alongside other donors – nevertheless failed to win sustainable openings in the humanitarian space before the military reclaimed power. Similarly, British officials proved crucial in backing IFI efforts to cut subsidies, increase public sector wages and establish social safety nets during the political transition, enabling Sudan to eventually satisfy IMF requirements and unlock concessional finance worth $2.5 billion for the first time in 30 years. Nonetheless, limited relief payments, declining living standards, rampant inflation and food shortages all heightened political and social divisions in the lead up to the October 2021 coup, suggesting the strategy framing UK and Western approaches may have ultimately been counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite facing difficult contextual conditions, resource limitations, uncertainties over critical assumptions and persistent ministerial upheaval in London, these interventions capture important elements of the contemporary UK “offer”. While claims of progress should not be overstated, the examples above provide useful insights into how the UK might continue to advance key elements of its agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the relatively small sample of outcomes, interventions and focus areas covered by this project, further research should be conducted into how the UK can pursue (and sustain) its goals, informed by an analysis of UK comparative advantages and limitations across the diplomatic, defence and developmental fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-3&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Attempts by UK officials to better integrate defence, international development and diplomatic (3Ds) work have made progress.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UK policy has long emphasised the importance of joined-up action across the “3Ds” and to varying degrees – as per IR21 – have tried to incorporate questions of trade, economic resilience and even science and technology. The research showed clear examples of integrated thinking and action, tying together development, diplomacy and defence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UK diplomatic, defence and developmental inputs appear, for the most part, mutually reinforcing in Kenya, with high-level engagement from Whitehall combining well with the influence, capabilities and sensitivity of country-based teams. For example, girls’ education has been a UK priority for many years, and coordination across the different sections of BHC was said to have accelerated progress on project delivery. Diplomatic outreach likewise complemented long-term electoral reforms, helping mitigate the risk of local spoilers by ensuring capacity-building efforts were palatable to Kenyan elites. There were also various cases of trade and UK private sector investment becoming better linked with development work, and progress synthesising defence coverage with other strands of UK engagement via frameworks such as CSSF (and specific units like BPST-A). Nevertheless, some respondents felt that the drive for integration may have contributed to deprioritisation of human development agendas in favour of commercial and security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Somalia, integration across different government workstreams has long been pursued. Good examples include active diplomatic support for debt relief alongside technical work by development staff. This apparently helped with anti-corruption efforts in the security sector, though there was said to be room for improvement in linking up legacy DFID development work, military inputs and Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF)-funded projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sudan has provided fewer opportunities to pursue defence engagement or promote trade, but use of development aid and diplomacy has become more integrated over time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the telecoms sector, Ethiopia provided an example of joined-up working across diplomacy, trade promotion and economic development. But outside peacekeeping work, there have been few opportunities for defence engagement in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; To support more coherent, joined-up UK policy towards Africa using the International Development/Africa ministerial NSC seat that was announced in IR23 to put key topics (for example, development, migration, debt) regularly and proactively in front of senior and mid-level decision-makers from across government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Improve cross-governmental understanding of integrated working across defence, diplomacy and development issues. Measures could include objective-setting, training (for example, the FCDO diplomatic academy), work shadowing or issuing good practice guides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-4&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the abolition of DFID is regretted by some UK regional partners, the creation of the FCDO, though unplanned, shows early promise.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The merger of the FCO and DFID has contributed towards stronger policy integration in several cases, and appeared to have been easier in smaller missions or where there was a range of UK interests and perspectives in play and therefore greater balance between the voices of different government departments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the disruption associated with internal planning and reorganisation, the FCDO’s formation was generally considered beneficial in Somalia and Sudan. For example, ambassadorial oversight of humanitarian and development work was said to have improved in Sudan since the DFID–FCO merger, corporate messaging became more unified, and dealings with the Sudanese government became easier to communicate. In both countries, DFID’s footprint and resources – though important – did not overshadow those of other departments. Additionally, there was broad acceptance that development challenges had political and security roots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, UK missions hosting a variety of similarly resourced departments, and which had strong incentives to integrate cross-government cooperation into daily operations, were probably better placed to combine FCO and legacy DFID infrastructure into a unified arrangement. In the case of Kenya, the merger was thought to have increased diplomatic engagement in health-related work, and led to better links between trade and development initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, issues over prioritisation and leadership seem to have arisen when combining DFID Ethiopia’s sizeable staff base and budget with a far smaller FCO presence. Although benefits were noticeable over time, with former DFID humanitarian advisers now described as more cognisant of political factors associated with gaining access to the Tigray region, some partners felt the creation of the FCDO had cost the UK, undermining its hard-won reputation for aid and development leadership. This feeling was more prominent in Ethiopia and to some degree in Kenya, both countries having enjoyed long engagement with DFID linked to years of high aid spending levels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A frequently referenced issue was a lack of pre-merger planning. Slow implementation, including delays with integrating teams and systems, were frustrations in all countries, with staff morale (and retention) across UK embassies suffering in many cases. Ongoing restructuring has been necessary at different levels since the new FCDO was formed, and considerable time has been taken up with iterative reorganisation and re-strategising, down to individual embassies and teams. In line with previous research on “machinery of government” changes, all indications are that the creation and refinement of the FCDO will be unfinished business for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Explicit change management processes should be used to guide any further organisational change. Planning should cater for foreseeable risks, draw on the merger’s early lessons and prioritise communicating future direction with external partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-5&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK retains a good reputation across the region for the calibre of its diplomats and development and defence experts, and it has broadly maintained staffing levels despite budget cuts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite budget cuts and reported staff departures at corporate level, the FCDO and the MoD have maintained similar numbers of staff with a focus on the region between 2015 and 2022, and other departments such as Investment and Trade, have slightly increased their presence in Kenya and Ethiopia. Maintaining staff numbers has provided some “damage mitigation”, allowing officials to preserve relationships, provide technical support or exert influence, despite reduced budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The perceived quality of UK staff has similarly been a stabilising factor. It has helped to protect at least some longstanding networks amid political and budget uncertainties, supplemented by strategic staff placements to facilitate multilateral collaboration. The UK’s influence across multiple issues and sectors could however prove time-limited – research findings suggested that existing “clout” may only be sustainable if a narrower set of priorities is adopted or additional resources are brought to bear. At the same time, the increasing arrival of inexperienced civil servants across regional postings has raised questions over the durability of institutional memory in UK embassies, and the transferability of knowledge, contacts and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Building on lessons from the DFID–FCO merger, ensure that the FCDO’s operating model, including its staff base and handling of external relationships, is optimised to support integrated ways of working in a competitive, post-Brexit context. As part of this, ensure skilled international development professionals are attracted, retained and tasked to work effectively alongside others in pursuit of integrated policy agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-6&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK is reasonably well regarded as a development, defence and diplomatic actor across the region. Despite this, a range of middle and great powers increasingly offer alternative forms of support to East African governments, which contribute to perceptions of declining UK influence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research showed that although the UK is less well resourced than the EU or the US, it is often credited by its partners with solid technical knowledge, expertise and convening power. This is in part due to the previous work of DFID, but extends beyond development issues. UK defence and security inputs (for example, training) are also well thought of, but there is awareness that UK political sensitivities can lead to cooperation being curtailed or withdrawn, as previously happened in Ethiopia and Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UK diplomatic skill and outreach are also well regarded. The UK is seen as less strident than the US, with respondents mentioning the UK’s useful closed-door bilateral work and its presence in a range of diplomatic forums. While the UK is often expected to follow US positions, many feel that the UK can still act as a “bridge” between Washington and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prominent non-Western actors in the region include China and Russia, Turkey and the Gulf states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turkey is seen as focused on commercial and security issues. It has gained a reputation for small-scale investments and a willingness to deal at subnational level, although in Somalia it has successfully combined soft power, direct investment, military assistance, infrastructural development and humanitarian aid to become one of the FGS’s most prominent international partners. Crucially, this crosscuts elite and wider public sentiment, with Turkish officials, business delegates and NGO workers “walking the streets” and immersing themselves in the daily realities of Somali life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Gulf States are thought to seek stability that protects investments (for example, land and productive enterprises in Ethiopia and Sudan) and are seen as pursuing “cheque-book diplomacy”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China has a distinctive offer – financing quickly at scale with few conditions, particularly around infrastructure or agriculture. It has had some success framing itself as more generous than traditional donors, including through swift Covid-19 “vaccine diplomacy”. Civil society actors in the region often worry that China’s lack of conditionality or interest in accountability issues can fuel corruption or lower technical standards. More recently, the attractions of its developmental model may also be starting to shift, with loans becoming more expensive, alongside Beijing’s increasing reluctance to fund loss-making “white elephant projects” amid a downturn in its domestic economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia was seen as competing on different grounds compared with the UK and the West, due to quite specific security (arms and miliary cooperation), commercial and political interests. It enjoys residual sympathies due to Soviet support for anti-colonial struggles and longstanding military links. In Ethiopia, Moscow benefits from a shared history of Orthodox Christianity. As with China, there is mutual interest in the principles of non-interference.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linked to the arrival or revival of these “alternative” actors, it is sometimes said that Western, and UK influence, is in decline. There are several aspects to this, ranging from the idea that alternative offers are on the table, to the growing self-sufficiency and assertiveness of national leaders in countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia. This perception of relative decline needs to be recognised in its own right, independent of any impact that UK aid cuts or the withdrawal from the EU may have had on the UK’s standing. Frustrations with the West’s past double standards or moral failings also shape views across the region. Yet there is no consensus on whether the UK has found the right balance in terms of “pragmatism” versus “principles”. It wins plaudits from some in the region for pursuing “practical solutions”, but is seen by others as “less principled” than countries such as Denmark and Sweden, which tend to foreground issues of human rights and gender.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure that forging long-term partnerships with a range of constituencies becomes central to strategies in East Africa and for priority countries elsewhere, backed by sufficient time, resources and incentivising development and retention of regional expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Building on this study, commission formal reviews of the contribution that UK defence engagement and international development efforts can feasibly make to UK foreign policy aims globally, focusing strongly on UK added value and clearer prioritisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-7&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK has established relationships and partnerships with a variety of actors. It often operates effectively through ad hoc groupings of bilateral and multilateral networks in the region and globally, bolstered by envoys and technical specialists.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the UK–Kenya relationship remains strong, the UK’s cultural influence and the perceived value of its international development “offer” seems to be declining. As the UK competes for commercial advantage with China, the US and others, it has arguably shifted towards “less abrasive” terms of engagement and closer alignment to government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK maintains a range of productive relationships in Ethiopia, but changing political dynamics and the Tigray conflict have upended a previously close partnership with the federal government. Navigating an increasingly polarised environment since 2020, the UK had to work harder to maintain influence and access as it juggled pursuit of humanitarian access, development and trade agendas and exploring ceasefires and peace-talk options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fraught security situation in Somalia makes it hard for foreign donors to build relations beyond reductive, state-centric echo-chambers in FMS palaces or Villa Somalia. Nevertheless, the UK retains a significant voice and exercises comparatively strong links at the subnational level, often acting as a broker for other international stakeholders. With its membership of the Quad and the Quint, the World Bank’s Multi-Partner Fund, the Core Security Partners Group and S6; participation in or chairmanship of several coordination platforms; and position as UN Penholder, the UK has carved a leading diplomatic role and reputation for development expertise that can sometimes catalyse effective responses from others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK enjoys substantial depth and quality of partnerships both within Sudan and with regional actors. The UK won some praise for its political and technical support to the 2019 transitional government, and its support to debt relief. Many pro-democracy campaigners worry about Western willingness to compromise with Sudan’s military, while others would welcome increased UK engagement. Western influence may be seen as declining relative to that of players such as Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, but a strength in the UK’s approach has until recently been its engagement with such players.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure links and communication between regional and embassy-level officials, including “special envoys”, to coordinate advocacy and diplomacy, and better align missions and engagement across the Gulf and Eastern Africa. This includes adequately resourcing envoy positions, streamlining information flows (across Whitehall and country missions), and providing access to relevant teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Push to consolidate a clear strategy for ad hoc groups such as the Quad, the Quint, S6 and Friends of Sudan, working with partners to clarify (and potentially deconflict) their respective roles, resources, membership and mandates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-8&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Between 2019 and 2021, the UK bilateral aid budget was reduced by around 50% across the region. External relationships suffered as funding decisions were arrived at iteratively and were not always well communicated.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reduced UK aid budget is probably the most significant variable examined in this project. The speed and extent of cuts damaged the UK’s reputation and partnerships in all four countries. While examples were found of cutbacks driving innovation, and relationships with national governments and key partners have endured in most cases, the UK is generally seen as less reliable by many organisations that it has partnered with on international aid and development work (both up- and downstream).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK was not the only donor to have reduced funding in Kenya over the research period, but respondents routinely noted that the scale of cuts (equivalent to 46% between 2019 and 2021) lacked any obvious strategic logic and risked diminishing UK capabilities, even in areas where it had previously found success. Despite the recognised need to consolidate procedural and institutional improvements over successive ballot cycles, for instance, stakeholders faced pressure to slash funding for electoral support, detracting from the sustainability of long-term cultural, normative and structural change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Ethiopia, where past UK aid funding had contributed to impressive reductions in the poverty rate, the decrease in UK bilateral aid by over 50% between 2019 and 2021 was poorly received by many stakeholders. Shrinking budgets did in some cases lead to fresh thinking from UK officials about delivery options, for example, focusing minds on how to draw in resources from elsewhere. But the overall drop hampered the ability of the FCDO’s implementing partners to plan, deliver and maintain good relations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flows of UK bilateral aid to Somalia rose considerably between 2019 and 2020, but diminished by 56% the following year, with cuts in staple activities including support for public administration, subnational governance and humanitarian relief. Although the UK is still respected and able to deliver impact with well-designed programming (as, for example, on famine relief and stabilisation), the reductions were described by many as detrimental to UK capacity and likely to diminish influence. While UK officials have been recognised for their expertise, capabilities and coordination during the 2017 humanitarian relief effort in Somalia, federal government stakeholders recently criticised the UK for becoming a “smaller player” and neglecting its leadership role. The disruption or scaling down of projects, delays in tendering or launching follow-up programmes, and confusion over long-term funding have reduced confidence in UK commitments. Resource levels are now arguably mismatched to the UK’s long-term state-building ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast to Kenya and Ethiopia, UK budget allocations for Sudan increased in 2020, as the UK sought to demonstrably support Khartoum’s political transition, becoming Whitehall’s fifth-largest bilateral commitment globally. However, funding levels fell back by roughly 55% in 2021/22, due to the 2021 coup, when all non-humanitarian assistance was suspended. Although the UK has traditionally been the largest donor to the UN-run Sudan Humanitarian Fund, today the US, Germany and the Netherlands make larger contributions, leading humanitarian partners to expect a decline in UK influence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarify intentions regarding the 0.7% GNI spending target, including spending priorities in the event of either future budget increases or cutbacks. Ad interim, introduce flexibility by confirming that the current 0.5% GNI spending measure is a floor, not a ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Brexit did not significantly impair the UK’s operational effectiveness in the region, but alongside other factors has probably contributed to a perception of declining influence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving the EU has excluded the UK from country-level EU coordination forums in the region. This means that the UK no longer has a formal role in determining the direction of EU defence, development and humanitarian priorities, nor in agreeing common positions. But this has cut two ways. The UK bilateral aid budget received a boost following EU withdrawal, as member contributions were no longer required of the UK. In terms of diplomatic positioning, UK officials now have a freer hand. In these respects, Brexit appeared to have little overt impact on the UK’s reputation or effectiveness in Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia. Yet media coverage of protracted UK–EU withdrawal negotiations, and very public politicking around the issue in the UK, did negatively affect perceptions of the UK in the region. Some variations were evident across countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Brexit did not dramatically change UK standing and influence in Kenya, some interviewees argued that it had lost strategic cover – previously able to “lead from the back” on sensitive policy issues in a former colony, the UK now has one fewer channel for exercising influence. When combined with high ministerial turnover and poorly communicated aid reductions, there was also a widespread sense that the UK had become a less predictable partner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coming alongside large aid budget cuts and the end of DFID, leaving the EU was felt by many Ethiopian interviewees who valued the UK and DFID’s track record to have diminished UK influence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK’s existing relationships in Sudan have weathered Brexit comparatively well. Despite withdrawing from EU members’ meetings, workarounds have been found to coordinate with EU players. The UK’s network of officials operated effectively across multiple forums in Khartoum, the wider region and New York. Active in the UK–US–Norwegian “Troika” and the “Quad” (the UK with the US, Saudi Arabia and the UAE), Whitehall appears to have offset its loss of influence over EU policy. Field research showed many believed that UK dexterity and messaging improved after Brexit, although it was argued that UK ministers might have concentrated more on Sudan’s early political transition in 2019 had it not been for Brexit negotiations at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Respondents in Somalia also noted a diversion of UK diplomatic attention during the negotiation period. Others warned that withdrawing UK personnel from Somalia-facing EU activities could undermine local commitments, in part because UK funding contributions and political advocacy helped drive support for AMISOM/ATMIS in Brussels. However, the approval of successive EU financial packages in 2022 and 2023 appeared to have defused these concerns, at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure there is sufficient flexibility to continue informal engagement and coordination between UK and EU officials over the long term, particularly at the operational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Invest in working groups and bilateral platforms to enable the UK to continue its role as a “transatlantic bridge” between the EU and the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly communicate the scope, scale and mechanics of continuing UK–EU cooperation to help defuse perceptions of an isolated, post-Brexit foreign policy, particularly to local audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-10&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finding 10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UK strategies at the country level were sometimes unclear, overly broad or outpaced by contextual changes. The lack of a regional strategy also remains a significant gap, given the transnational nature of the opportunities and challenges facing Eastern Africa.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research suggests that the UK could improve its efficacy across Eastern Africa by looking afresh at strategy and providing support for implementation. At the country and sub-regional level, strategies were often vague or outdated, with contentious assumptions, disparities between goals and resources, and a lack of plausible delivery plans contributing to confusion and inefficiency. Similarly, theories of change, shared objectives and priorities were not always well articulated or connected, and at the regional level there appears to be little in the way of a viable roadmap. Given the transnationalised dynamics of local insecurity, development, politics and economic systems – especially across comparatively deprived borderlands – the lack of an East Africa strategy is a serious omission. It is also true that a policy of integrated working across the “3Ds”, linking to other policy areas (for example, trade, science and technology) as prescribed in IR21 and IR23, is complex to execute and cannot be driven by rhetoric alone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the Strategic Partnership, the hierarchy of UK objectives in Kenya was not always well framed or understood – although in reality defence and trade relations increasingly appeared to overshadow concerns around accountability or human development. Additionally, there were indications that UK defence engagement and relationship building would benefit from being placed within a clearer overarching strategy, backed up by appropriate political outreach, although this process may reportedly already be under review as the MoD looks to clarify how “persistent engagement” will function in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was not clear whether UK action in Ethiopia was guided by an up-to-date detailed strategy that matched well-articulated goals and interests to available resources and political will. A wide range of engagements, some in tension with one another, had been kept in play for some years amid a deteriorating context. The UK is not alone here – most Western actors have struggled to adapt to the pace of developments across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, recent events in Sudan are prompting renewed scrutiny of Western and UK strategy. Sudanese interviewees were often sceptical of international efforts to integrate military and security stakeholders into transitional government arrangements, despite the UK’s ability to dialogue with “all sides”. Others argued that UK and other Western actors had focused unduly on technocratic economic reforms during the failed 2019–21 political transition – at the expense of expanding non-elite networks and deepening political analysis to help chart a long-term path towards democratisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite reduced resources, Whitehall’s strategy towards Somalia has proved fairly consistent. Formally committed to the STP, the UK and other “likeminded” countries are continuing to back a “good enough” federal government capable of containing Al-Shabaab. That said, some query the execution and underlying assumptions of this approach, particularly the feasibility of building a stable state without prior societal and clan agreement on basic political questions. In the absence of local buy-in, ownership and shared alignment, the creation of artificial systems dependent on external resourcing raises the risk of aid diversion and economic extraversion that may disrupt or undermine Somali-led peacebuilding. At the same time, a reduction or withdrawal of donor support would likely precipitate a complete government collapse akin to that in Afghanistan. Amid new priorities in Ukraine, implausible timelines, international fatigue, and deeply embedded political and developmental challenges, the gulf between the strategic ambitions and hard realities of UK engagement seem to be growing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop integrated strategies for UK engagement with priority African countries and regions, including those in Eastern Africa. Guided by high-level policy such as IR23 and NSC decisions and informed by the context, these strategies should clearly articulate interests, values and objectives, while offering a means to revisit assumptions, possible dilemmas and trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Measures could include setting shared objectives, training (for example, the FCDO diplomatic academy), work shadowing or issuing good practice guides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has set out research findings on the UK’s use of international development, diplomacy and defence engagement in Eastern Africa from 2015 to 2022. It finds that the region has not been allotted the resources or level of attention initially signalled by IR21. It is notable that the UK has made progress on a number of its policy agendas despite domestic, regional and global challenges. The UK’s best results often seem to derive from long-term engagements. These have generated contextual understanding and broad-based relationships that could be leveraged in future for positive change. With strong cultural ties and a track record of providing life-saving humanitarian assistance and development and defence know-how, many in the region recognise the UK’s contributions and might welcome increased engagement from the UK on genuinely shared priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in a post-Brexit world of increasing geopolitical competition, the UK will have to face questions about its positioning towards Africa. The research surfaces important questions concerning the nature of UK–Africa relations and the role of aid, development and defence engagement within an integrated foreign policy. For example, policy statements in favour of “integration” or “partnerships”, while useful, do not in themselves constitute an effective strategy. With a contracting resource base, positive results may become harder to demonstrate in an increasingly competitive and transactional environment. African governments also now have a wider array of potential partners and greater leverage in shaping foreign engagement. This fact, together with policy decisions such as a reduced aid budget, contributes to perceptions of declining UK influence within the region. In the face of this, the UK will need to communicate its added value towards Africa very clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the initial struggles around changes from Brexit to the FCDO merger recede, new opportunities could emerge for the UK to forge effective two-way partnerships. The UK should now clearly articulate its policy priorities towards the region and Africa writ large and establish a two-way dialogue with African partners at government and societal level on shared priorities. Whereas UK approaches were previously characterised by the use of aid for poverty reduction, the scope of UK development engagement is broadening, focusing more explicitly on the national interest and on establishing wider partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the country moves through its next electoral cycle by 2024, the UK government would do well to consider how the UK can pursue its significant diplomatic, security and development interests towards Africa in light of this project’s findings and recommendations, as well as their implications for engagement elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Fbf1LlO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（28日）踏入審訊第115天。本案由2月6日開審至今，歷時近7個月，最後一名不認罪被告余慧明今完成4天作供，辯方案情完結，法官暫定押至11月27日讓雙方進行口頭結案陳詞，料需時約兩至三周。就法官李運騰有份審理的《蘋果日報》案原定12月18日開審，法官陳慶偉指若撞期，該案可再押後，李運騰亦稱相信該案律師不會介意延誤多數天。法官亦指押後期間會處理部分認罪被告就同意案情的爭議，但暫不會處理求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余今接受盤問時，表明認為以否決預算案爭取五大訴求為合法、合理的手段，強調並非「淨係想破壞而無建設」，真正目的是爭取雙普選。被問是否有意與其他議員聯手否決預算案，余稱每個議員為獨立個體，「我冇辦法迫人哋去做」，「墨落無悔」聲明亦無表明會聯同其他議員運用權力；而她從決定參選至勝出也沒有相信參選人之間有協議。余作供完畢後，向旁聽親友面露微笑做握拳手勢，散庭時興奮地跳起數下，向親友飛吻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱雖以個人身分參選仍諮詢會員若大部分不支持或不參選&quot;&gt;余稱雖以個人身分參選仍諮詢會員、若大部分不支持或不參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選衞生服務界的前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明，今繼續接受主控萬德豪盤問。余表示以個人而非工會身分參選，她先諮詢工會是因作為一名工會代表，擔心會員對她參選會有些反感，同意並非一定要諮詢，只是出於禮貌。法官陳仲衡問，那余想過工會不支持她參選會怎樣？余指如會員大部分不太支持，「我可能唔考慮呢條路線，因為始終嗰陣時我都係一個工會嘅代表，我唔可以唔理會我啲會員嘅意見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，約於6月初選競選階段時，聘請3至4名全職競選團隊成員，他們的薪金「全部都係我自己畀嘅」，因她以個人名義出選，「我一蚊都冇用過工會錢㗎，況且我係工會代表嗰時，我都冇收過工會嘅人工」；她亦有十多名義工，當中3至5名為核心義工。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱從無讀過戴耀廷區諾軒文章&quot;&gt;余稱從無讀過戴耀廷區諾軒文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，余的團隊成員有否告知她戴耀廷和區諾軒曾寫過關於否決預算案和「攬炒」的文章，余說沒有。萬再指戴作為初選組織者和公眾人物，余知道他於Facebook和《蘋果日報》發表文章嗎？余指不知道，因無追蹤戴Facebook，也無人告訴過她；而她「睇連登多過睇報紙」，看《蘋果日報》亦主要看港聞和娛樂，不知道戴對35+的目標有政治看法。余後在覆問稱，被捕前從無讀過戴耀廷和區諾軒的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱否決財案爭五大訴求為合法合理手段&quot;&gt;余稱否決財案爭五大訴求為合法合理手段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就初選提名表格，余慧明同意簽署和提交時均無留意「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」的條款，指表格由助理填寫，助理無問她何謂共識，亦無告訴她曾否問組織者。萬德豪續指，條款中「目標」的英文是「goals」、是眾數，問余其助理是否護士？教育程度是什麼？余指是大學生。法官陳仲衡指萬是假設該助理閱讀表格的英文版，陳慶偉亦着控方改問助理有否與她討論計劃目標，「不論語言」，余回應沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，余慧明是否曾提及，願（willing to）以任何合法方式爭取五大訴求，余答「係」。萬再問，余是會（would）以任何合法方式爭取五大訴求？余說：「誒同頭先嗰個問題有乜嘢分別啊，都係『係』囉，或者你會唔會解釋一次第二次嘅問法同埋第一次嘅問法會唔會有乜大分別？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬說第一個問題是「You were willing」，第二個問題是「You would」，法官陳慶偉笑說：「有什麼分別？」旁聽席發笑。李運騰說沒關係，總之余兩條問題答案均為「是」，余同意，並在盤問下指，否決預算案爭取五大訴求「係一個合法兼且合理嘅手段」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問是否有意聯同他人否決-余每個議員為獨立個體無法迫人做&quot;&gt;被問是否有意聯同他人否決 余：每個議員為獨立個體無法迫人做&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就余慧明於2020年3月發布的〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉，提到「爭取35席後為手段，然後全面否決所有政府提出的議案為目的，藉此觸發基本法第五十條，令特首宣佈解散立法會，制造憲政危機，此為制度內的『攬炒』」，萬德豪指若無35席便不能否決所有政府議案，而為了行使否決權，大多數議員應一同行動，余均同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，因此余有意與其他議員聯手（join force）組成大多數否決預算案？余說：「但係每一個議員都係自己一個獨立嘅個體，我冇辦法迫人哋去做囉。」李運騰指，但若要達到余所說的目標，便需要民主派議員合作或有協議，余同意，並於覆問稱從決定參選至勝出初選，沒有相信參選人之間有協議，而她於8月訪問提到「我覺得大家係要簽一份共同認同嘅綱領」，是因「就係冇（協議）我先會咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱否決財案非目的僅手段我哋唔係淨係想破壞冇建設&quot;&gt;余稱否決財案非目的僅手段：我哋唔係淨係想破壞冇建設&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又承認上文錯用「目的」一字，指全面否決所有政府議案「唔係我哋嘅最終目的」，最終目的應是該段最後一句「再共同建構重光後的香港」，即「真正落實到『港人治港，高度自治』」；又解釋指：「因為我哋唔係想爭取否決晒所有議案呀嘛，我哋唔係淨係想破壞而冇建設，我哋嘅真正目的係想爭取雙普選」，同意法官李運騰指否決預算案並非目的，而是達致目的之手段（means to an end）。萬德豪質疑，余稱這是其宣言，會花時間準備，余同意，「但唔代表我嘅選字一定係最正確囉，始終我真係一個政治嘅素人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就余提到：「當初要爭取議會過半，全面反枱，迫使政權解散立法會進行破局。這個目標一日未達成，一日亦要堅持」，余重申否決財案並非最終目標，強調「我係一直都想爭取五大訴求缺一不可」，並認為真普選是最重要。余在法官陳慶偉追問下，同意她望廢除功能組別，因認為「一個議席唔應該淨係代表到一小撮人嘅利益囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱簽墨落僅表達自己立場不包括聯同他人運用權力&quot;&gt;余稱簽「墨落」僅表達自己立場、不包括聯同他人運用權力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於余於6月簽署的「墨落無悔」聲明，萬德豪指余知道其他簽署者均同意當選後會否決預算案，余說「依個我唔肯定喎，佢簽咋嘛」，「佢哋話佢哋會囉。」萬續指出，余簽聲明時，實向公眾表明她會聯同其他未來議員否決預算案，余說：「我只係表達返我自己嘅立場，依度都唔包括話我會聯同其他立法會議員一齊運用基本法賦予嘅權力啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱專訪未完全反映其意思-重申若提修改或釀公關災難&quot;&gt;余稱專訪未完全反映其意思 重申若提修改或釀公關災難&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引余慧明4月的《獨立媒體》專訪〈從組織工會到走進議會 余慧明：我要真攬炒！〉，提到余慧明「正積極考慮參選立法會『衞生服務界』，為了立法會過半後，全面否決政府提出的議案，製造憲政危機，重組一個真正為人民服務的政府」，余指這是記者選用的詞語，但「唔完全反映到我嘅意思囉」。李運騰指，該段最後也提到「重組一個真正為人民服務的政府」，與余的文章意思一致，余同意「差唔多」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續指，余受訪後無向記者表示要修改。余重申當時已進入競選階段，如向記者指「有啲字眼我想執」、甚至全篇文章下架，有機會被其他潛在候選人攻擊、造成「公關災難」，故無特別處理。萬指，但無任何事情阻止余在 Facebook 就文章發表意見，余同意，但她沒有這樣做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬再引訪問提到「她很清楚，立會過半的目標，是透過否決政府的所有議案，令立法會停擺，觸發憲政危機」。余指「目標」是記者選擇的用語，萬追問是錯誤的選擇？余說：「我唔識幫佢答喎。」李運騰追問記者有否扭曲余的意思，余說：「佢唔算扭曲，但解釋得唔夠詳細囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續主動舉例，訪問提到「她記得，當時醫管局剛轉用電子派藥系統，有次醫生將某藥物的使用方法更改，系統卻沒有標示」，但她受訪時是指派藥的「三核五對（3 Checks 5 Rights）」中第二次核對只標示藥物處方，無顯示使用途徑。李運騰指毋須進入細節，「我們也不會明白」，余說：「可能陳慶偉法官會明」（陳為註冊藥劑師），陳慶偉說「我明白」，但笑言不認為與案相關，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余強調國安法後不認為爭取五大訴求的目標及手段違法&quot;&gt;余強調《國安法》後不認為爭取五大訴求的目標及手段違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就余慧明5月15日於「大紀元」的訪問，提及如當選後要反對政府任何議案，「去逼使呢個政權，佢一定要回應五大訴求缺一不可」，而非只是回應其中一兩個，又強調「我哋個口號唔淨係一個口號式嘅抗爭，我哋係要用行動去表達，我哋係要求政府真係要回應晒全部五大訴求，先可以叫做解決到呢件事囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問余，該想法直至《國安法》落實後是否也沒有改變？余同意，指「爭取五大訴求缺一不可，一直都係我爭取緊嘅嘢」，即使《國安法》通過後「我都唔認為爭取五大訴求缺一不可係違法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，余或認為目標不違法，但達致此目標的手段，余當時也認為是合法？余說「係」。控方問她曾否於訪問或 Facebook 專頁表明若政府放低身段對話，會與政府「有得傾」，余指記憶中沒有，強調「呢個係我嘅談判策略嚟嘅，我冇可能公開畀大眾知囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問是否意圖顛覆國家政權-余絕對不同意&quot;&gt;被問是否意圖顛覆國家政權 余：絕對不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就7月15日抗爭派記者會，梁晃維、岑敖暉、王百羽會上發言提及否決預算案時提到「我哋」，余說這是他們用的詞彙，但不等於事前「有傾過」。而余會後無向他們和公眾表示其言論不代表她，因認為無此需要，且每個議員也是獨立個體。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪最後指出控方案情，指余與其他被告串謀取得立會過半，無差別否決預算案，以迫使政府回應五大訴求，余不同意。萬再指她意圖顛覆國家政權，余答：「絕對不同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方完成覆問後，余完成作供，在座位喝水後，向旁聽親友面露微笑，在腰間做出握拳手勢，並在兩名懲教陪同下步回被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官下令控辯雙方分別於103及117前呈交結案陳詞&quot;&gt;官下令控辯雙方分別於10.3及11.7前呈交結案陳詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方案情完成，代表梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙其後表示，將呈上梁2015至2017年就預算案的投票紀錄。就結案陳詞，萬德豪指控方需時4星期準備，大律師石書銘稱辯方需要同樣時間。萬問控方會否被給予時間再回應，法官指控方通常無權就證據再回應，除非涉法律議題，控方屆時可再作申請。法官陳慶偉終下令，控方須於10月3日前呈交書面陳詞，辯方則於11月7日前回應，每名被告限30頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 續指本案牽涉頗為新的法例，辯方需更多頁數探討條文字眼。陳慶偉指可增加至35頁，又指辯方可以點列式處理。石書銘指辯方或就法律觀點呈交聯合陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/s2V9AWP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官暫定1127結案陳詞-料需時兩至三周&quot;&gt;官暫定11.27結案陳詞 料需時兩至三周&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑問，法庭能否定下結案陳詞日期。陳慶偉指未能決定，因視乎法律議題的複雜性，但大概是在11至12月期間，望能於聖誕節前後完成，又指向身旁的李運騰，指他有另一宗案件（黎智英《蘋果日報》案）將於12月18日開審，「我不能承諾你任何事情」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，聽取所有口頭陳詞或需兩至三星期，陳世傑再追問暫定日子，陳慶偉指大約是11月27日。潘熙問需多少天、5天是否可以，李運騰指5天有點太樂觀，因控方需涵蓋16名被告的案情及相關法律議題，控方陳詞或需5天，又指寧願預留較多時間（generous）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑關注，若11月27日開始陳詞，或與另案（《蘋果》案）重疊，陳慶偉擺動右手說：「那就由它，再延期（“So be it, further defer.”）」，庭上傳來笑聲。李運騰續說如有需要，不認為該案的律師會介意延誤多數天（“I don’t think the counsel in the other case would mind a few days’ delay if necessary.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RTcrhXX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 大律師 陳世傑&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉又指，案件押後期間，會處理部分認罪被告就同意案情的爭議，但李運騰補充不會在該段時間聽取求情，而是先處理事實的部分，Beel 指何桂藍望出席該些聆訊。陳慶偉下令休庭前，提醒各方執拾物品，指現在要清空此法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，多名旁聽人士上前揮手，梁國雄、林卓廷等也不住揮手回應，余慧明則在被告欄內興奮地跳起數下，又向旁聽親友飛吻。部分准保釋被告離庭時神情輕鬆，劉偉聰、何啟明，黃碧雲、施德來均一同離開，當中連日審訊均自備坐墊、交律師保管在庭內的施亦攜同座墊離開。漫畫家尊子今亦有來旁聽，「王婆婆」王鳳瑤亦有於庭外聲援。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2月初開審-至今近7個月&quot;&gt;2月初開審 至今近7個月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案今年2月6日開審，原定審期90天，至今歷時近7個月，惟至審訊第115天才完成辯方案情。47名被告中，原有18人不認罪，惟伍健偉和林景楠開審前改為認罪，最終16人不認罪受審。翻查資料，審訊第1至58日處理被告答辯和控方案情，第59至64日處理共謀者原則爭議及中段陳詞，第65日至115日則處理辯方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16名被告中，鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林及李予信10人獲准保釋，何桂藍、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄、余慧明及吳政亨6人則須還柙。而當中楊雪盈、黃碧雲、林卓廷和梁國雄均不作供亦無傳召證人；吳政亨和柯耀林無作供但有傳召證人，其餘10人均有出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊期間，認罪被告包括黃之鋒、朱凱廸、譚凱邦、馮達浚、梁晃維、岑敖暉、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、尹兆堅、毛孟靜、胡志偉及劉頴匡曾到庭旁聽，他們於開審首周獲准在正庭與不認罪被告同坐，但至區諾軒開始作供後被改安排至延伸庭就坐，其後男女分庭而坐。准保釋的呂智恆亦曾到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另有多人曾旁聽本案，包括歌手黃耀明，立法會議員謝偉俊（其律師行代表本案被告彭卓棋、區諾軒和鍾錦麟），漫畫家尊子，民主黨劉慧卿、黃偉賢，社民連陳寶瑩、黃浩銘、曾健成、陳皓桓，支聯會徐漢光，「王婆婆」王鳳瑤及多國領事等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件現暫定11月27日進行口頭結案陳詞，料法庭將押後裁決，並連同其餘31名認罪被告進行求情和判刑，意味屆時其中32名被告已還柙近2年8個月。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;余慧明稱初選結果公布後「35+計劃」已完結 後續協調僅處理「爛攤子」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1y0VMr6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（25日）踏入審訊第114天。余慧明繼續作供，就7月15日的抗爭派記者會，余自視為抗爭意志較堅定、與主流泛民有別的「抗爭派」而出席，但會前無與出席者討論發言內容，自言與他們「唔係好熟」，亦不同意記招是對組織者中止初選的回應、表示抗爭派想繼續。余又指當時「完全唔知」中聯辦前一天發聲明譴責初選或違法，並認為初選結果公布後，「35+計劃」已完結，其後若有協調工作亦只是處理計劃的「爛攤子」，她也是庭上始知組織者當時「有手尾」如選前民調要處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又指，衞生服務界從無討論關於財政預算案的問題，無共識辦有約束力的初選，否認呈堂協調文件是候選人共識。法官一度關注控方盤問基礎，控方指可作有關推論。此外，余亦稱其抗爭立場包括就抗疫議題提批評和建議，但卻被指為「抹黑政府」；余認為未能成功爭取是因無真正了解民意的政府，故最重要是爭取雙普選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余強調初選要有約束力-如落敗一定唔會參選&quot;&gt;余強調初選要有約束力 如落敗「一定唔會參選」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選衞生服務界的前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明繼續作供，余昨稱由於選民資格認證爭議，衞生服務界初選終並無約束力。辯方大律師石書銘今問，余當時是否認為要有約束力，余說「當然啦，如果唔係選嚟做咩呀」，強調初選目的只得一個，「就係揀選一位候選人，代表民主派出選衞生服務界」，故如其他候選人落選，「我係希望佢哋可以尊重個賽果囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KRhmE67.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 余慧明（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示衞生服務界群組紀錄，顯示當時提及四個方案，方案一為凡於衞生服務界票站投票的選民均假設為有資格投票，如至少三位候選人同意此方案，投票結果將有約束力；方案二為要提供有效證件才可投票，如至少三人同意此方案，結果將有約束力；方案三與方案二一樣，只是沒有約束力；方案四為取消初選。當中余慧明和劉凱文選擇方案二、李國麟選擇方案一、袁偉傑選擇方案三。最終戴耀廷指在無決定的狀態下，只能是方案三，投票只供參考。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，所以是一個妥協？余說：「只係一個無可奈何嘅方法囉」，並指戴曾說「如果唔接受嘅話就唔搞初選」，同意她是不情願接受，並曾發文表達自己立場，提及「希望亦相信各位候選人會尊重初選結果以達至舉辦初選的初衷，最終只有一位候選人代表民主派出選九月立法會選舉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，那若余於初選落敗，還會受約束不參選嗎？余加重了語氣：「依個正正就係我想講嘅嘢，我係願意有約束力的話，就係講，如果我係輸咗的話，我就一定唔會去參選囉。」即使最終方案無約束力，她自己也會遵從初選結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指衞生服務界從無討論財案問題僅視戴耀廷訊息為資訊分享&quot;&gt;余指衞生服務界從無討論財案問題、僅視戴耀廷訊息為「資訊分享」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就戴耀廷7月14日於群組發出「我公開訊息說35+目的，是運用基本法賦予立法會的權力包括否決財政預算案，今（令）特區政府問責，不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府，供大家參考」，余慧明同意是群組首次提及否決財案。余指「因為我哋個界別係從來都冇討論過關於財政預算案呢個問題，我只係覺得係一個資訊嘅分享」，故除以表情符號表示感謝外無其他回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，戴的訊息是突然出現，余知道他為何在群組發出嗎？余指因當時有建制派或黨媒說初選犯法，「所以我諗戴耀廷就係為咗回應呢啲咁嘅輿論，就 share 咗呢啲訊息出嚟囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指戴耀廷715退出群組余初選後約候選人開會拒劉凱文任plan-b&quot;&gt;余指戴耀廷7.15退出群組、余初選後約候選人開會拒劉凱文任「Plan B」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續確認，戴耀廷曾於初選前的7月6日發訊息指，若投票選民數目不理想，要於7月17日再舉行協調會議，以決定最後參選隊伍數目。余於初選後的7月14日曾發訊息問是否還需開會，戴耀廷說不用，惟余覺得「個問題未解決」，遂於7月16日發訊息邀請各參選人就衞生服務界的協調工作磋商，「想其他參選人即使無約束力下也尊重賽果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余確認，她發訊息前戴耀廷已退出群組，戴於7月15日發訊息指「結果已公布了，這群組的功能已完成。我一會兒會把這群組刪除」，不久後就退出群組。李運騰指，區諾軒曾稱當天早上到戴的辦公室表示退出初選，余記得，但對戴退出群組前有否任何人宣布35+計劃結束不太有印象，僅有印象於 Facebook 看到區諾軒稱要退出，但也不記得日期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，當時她無想過要組織者出席該會議，而最終僅劉凱文出席，會上劉提出想做余的「Plan B」，惟余最終拒絕：「因為我覺得佢同我嘅政治路線唔同。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指認知抗爭派記者會類似造勢大會自視抗爭派遂出席&quot;&gt;余指認知抗爭派記者會類似「造勢大會」、自視「抗爭派」遂出席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就7月15日舉行的抗爭派記者會，余指不記得有人直接邀請抑或邀請其競選團隊出席，她認為「抗爭派」即「抗爭意志比較堅定、同主流泛民係有分別」，而她自視為「抗爭派」，故決定出席，事前僅知道黃之鋒、何桂藍和岑敖暉會出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，就記者會的目的，「我認知嘅類似係造勢大會」，因知道是「立場比較進取」的初選勝出者出席。陳慶偉問，余當時知道7月14日中聯辦曾發聲明譴責初選或違法嗎？余指當時無留意到、「我係完全唔知」，是收到審訊文件夾後才知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余認為35計劃於715已完結-後續協調工作為處理爛攤子&quot;&gt;余認為「35+計劃」於7.15已完結 後續協調工作為「處理爛攤子」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再問，區諾軒於7月15日決定退出初選，記者會是對組織者中止初選的回應嗎？即抗爭派想要繼續（carry on）？余說「我嘅認知唔係」。陳問，即純粹慶祝抗爭派勝利？余回應當日發出的聲明亦提到另一個目的，「係想同泛民嘅一啲合作囉」，指她赴會前「我嘅認知都係咁多」。余亦不記得是在記者會前或後知道區諾軒退出、不肯定當時是否知道趙家賢翌日退出，也無留意戴耀廷其後宣布「休息」，因無追蹤其 Facebook。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問7月15日時，余認為「35+計劃」還繼續進行嗎？余說：「我認為係已經完咗㗎喇，即係當個（初選）結果出咗嚟之後。」陳指或已知道結果，但初選後或會再舉行民意調查及協調會議討論出選名單數量，追問余認為7月15或16日時，「35+計劃」是否仍繼續進行？余重申「對我嚟講係已經完結咗喇」。至於是否關注其他區，「我會 concern 係邊個出選囉」，「因為我要知道將來可能要同咩人合作囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，余說計劃已完結的說法不能是對的，因雖然已有初選結果，但衞生服務界的結果只供參考，余當然會預期有後續工作，例如有參選人拒從初選結果如何處理。余說：「我認為兩者係冇衝突嘅，因為我認為35+呢個 project 係真係完咗，而之後嘅協調工作，只係處理佢嘅爛攤子囉」。陳續指，大概是由區諾軒和戴耀廷所領導的後續工作，余回應：「當時我唔知佢有手尾做，但係喺庭上面就聽到係有囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指抗爭派記者會前無討論當選後做什麼同意抗爭派聲明內容&quot;&gt;余指抗爭派記者會前無討論當選後做什麼、同意抗爭派聲明內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，7月15日抵達記者會場時已看到部分出席者，但無與他們討論記者會說什麼，「因為我本身同佢哋唔係好熟呢，我自己坐埋咗一邊」。陳仲衡指部分人曾為她站台，余說「冇錯，佢哋純粹嚟站台囉，我哋稱唔上朋友，因為電話都冇，都係我嘅團隊邀請佢哋」。余亦指，會前出席者無討論當選後會做什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成和何桂藍早前稱，會前與會者一同草擬聲明。余表示，印象中沒有參與草擬，因對早前提到的 Google 文件「我冇印象我有見過」，亦不肯定當時有否被邀請參與討論。李運騰問余是否知道其他人當時在草擬聲明，余不肯定，但看到有部分出席者「揸住部電話」，「似係傾緊一啲嘢嘅」，她亦知道一般記者會流程會先讀出聲明或新聞稿，故預期會有一份類似的文件，只是不記得有否參與討論或草擬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就會上讀出的「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」，余指看騰本和片段令她有此印象，但如不看就不記得內容。辯方問為何余無留意，余指因認為聲明「都係 call 依個記者會嘅人準備囉」，而她只是「被邀請嘅出席者」。不過余亦表明承認是記者會出席者、有準備會上發言，並同意有在聲明署名。陳慶偉問她同意聲明內容嗎？余說：「我同意㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱爭取醫療制度改革未能成功因政府不解民意最重要爭取雙普選&quot;&gt;余稱爭取醫療制度改革未能成功因政府不解民意、最重要爭取雙普選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘其後問，余慧明除了爭取雙普選，就衞生服務界的議題還有何抗爭立場。余指雖記者會未必講明，但她「一直都係做緊」，其「抗爭立場」可分為三個層次，首先作為醫療界別的工會代表，她一直就抗疫議題提出批評和建議，「但係可惜都不被政府接納嘅，更加被人形容為係別有用心、抹黑政府囉」；其次她一直爭取醫療制度改革，改善醫患比例，指是工會第一屆理事會政綱，他們亦有推行實質的「社區醫療自救計劃」，「想話畀人聽我哋唔係得個講字囉。」李運騰指毋須細節。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第三個層面，余認為上述兩個層面都未能成功爭取的原因，是「我哋冇一個真正了解民意嘅政府，所以最重要嘅層面，係我哋要爭取一個雙普選嘅制度」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余相信否決財案機制無違反基本法或國安法&quot;&gt;余相信否決財案機制無違反《基本法》或《國安法》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「區區Interview」於8月10日發布余慧明訪問片段，余指訪問由一至兩小時剪成10分鐘，內容「大致上係 fair」，但有部分剪走其詳細解釋「令到成句嘅意思就有啲怪」。就余提到：「我諗破局最初嘅概念就係35+，即係爭取議會過半引致個憲制危機啦，咁就要佢用行政命令去解散立法會，令到佢一定要回應『五大訴求，缺一不可』呢個目標」，余指「爭取議會過半」後她應有解釋有何現象引致憲政危機。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問余的意思有否被扭曲或斷章取義，余說「有少少㗎」，因議會過半不會即時引致憲政危機，「佢壓縮咗我一啲字眼」，李運騰指理解是兩次否決財案令特首下台，余同意，亦同意片中表達意思與她早前的訪問和 Facebook 帖文亦一致：「因為我認為透過《基本法》之下解決行政立法分歧嘅機制，係冇違反《基本法》或者《國安法》嘅，我當時仍然係咁樣相信。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訪問稱要簽共同綱領-余就係冇我先會咁講&quot;&gt;訪問稱要簽「共同綱領」 余：就係冇我先會咁講&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余訪問中亦提到「共同綱領」，認為如以爭取「五大訴求，缺一不可」為目標，「我覺得大家係要簽一份共同認同嘅綱領，起碼叫做大家有個 agreement 喺依度」；又指如真的促成35+，「候選人都應該要認同番呢一份共同嘅綱領」，不要臨陣退縮，「就會令到我哋唔夠票，做唔到呢個效果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問是哪些人之間的「共同綱領」，余指「大家」是指正選後真的達成35席以上的民主派。石書銘問以余當時認知，民主派潛在參選人之間有任何協議嗎？余說：「就係冇，所以我先會咁講。」余亦指，無與組織者和參與者就當選後做什麼有任何協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱對公民黨及數個初選記者會不知悉無深究三投三不投&quot;&gt;余稱對公民黨及數個初選記者會不知悉、無深究「三投三不投」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余最後確認，就3月25日公民黨記者會、3月26日的35+記者會、7月6日、11和12日的初選記者會，她當時均不知道，直至收到審訊文件夾才得知。而她於6月9日初選記者會後獲競選團隊告知會上正式公布衞生服務界有初選；她亦有留意7月13日公布初選結果的記者會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「三投三不投」，余重申到了「好後期」、於7月投票日前才聽過，但無深究內容。陳仲衡指該計劃與余關注初選的約束力有關，余重申當時有正職和初選競選，「私人時間都冇晒」，「我真係冇去深究依個唔關初選事嘅 programme 囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱無追問戴耀廷因搭單搞唔係太好意思催人哋&quot;&gt;余稱無追問戴耀廷因「搭單搞」、「唔係太好意思催人哋」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘表示完成主問，續由主控萬德豪進行盤問。余表示4月中聯絡戴耀廷提出能否辦衞生服務界初選後，二人無再聯絡，直至6月9日記者會才知會辦初選。控方質疑余期間無追問戴，余指因衞生服務界是「搭單去搞，即係禮貌上，我唔係太好意思去催人哋」，重申認為「如果搞得成就去啦，搞唔成就再算啦」；而余雖望初選有約束力，但聯絡戴時無表明，「因為我已經假設會有囉」，「如果冇嘅話，咁搞嚟做咩。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又重申，5月中《立場新聞》分別訪問4名潛在候選人時，得知有另外3名潛在競爭者，但不記得他們有否表達對辦初選的看法，余也無與3人討論過初選應否有約束力，無留意就此有協議。余又指直至6月24日戴耀廷開設群組前，戴無提過初選安排或候選人間要有協議，而余就初選只曾聯絡戴耀廷而非其他組織者，並指她會「自己搞返」與組織者的聯絡，宣傳則交助手處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余否認與候選人有共識辦有約束力初選&quot;&gt;余否認與候選人有共識辦有約束力初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪又引戴耀廷決定初選不具約束力後，李國麟曾發訊息「未有共識 不就是照舊嗎？」，指「照舊」是指有約束力的初選，余指「我唔係咁理解」；萬又引李提到「大會突然作此決定 與初選的原則及初心不同 有負選民期望 實屬不幸」，指李想有約束力的初選，余回應只能說李想選方案一。萬最後指出，事實上余與其他候選人有共識辦有約束力的初選，余不同意，「因為我哋冇討論過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指協議文件為候選人共識-官關注有否證據-控方指屬推論&quot;&gt;控方指協議文件為候選人共識 官關注有否證據 控方指屬「推論」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續展示「民主派衛生服務界協調機制協議」文件，該文件提及「會積極」運用否決權，並提到有兩個票站。余昨稱戴耀廷原提出4個，但最終減至3個。萬引戴於群組提及有4個票站時，余曾問：「想問最後只有四個票站可供衞生服務界投票，但總票站有二百多個？」萬說余用「最後」一詞，是因原本只有兩個票站，而組織者再找多了？余笑說：「我依度嘅意思就係總票站有200幾個，但係最後我哋得4個？你畀咁少我？」旁聽席發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續指出，事實上該文件是衞生服務界潛在候選人的書面共識，余不同意。萬再指，該共識是在6月8日前已達成。陳慶偉問「6月8日前？」，李運騰亦問控方有否證據顯示該界別候選人6月8日前曾一同商議。萬回應是根據趙家賢的 WhatsApp 紀錄，李運騰問趙有否出席衞生服務界協調會議，萬說沒有。李續說，「你可以指出案情以節省時間，但她會不同意」，余答「不同意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5WXLQre.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 趙家賢（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問：「為何是6月8日？」，萬解釋趙家賢當天曾要求戴將所有協議的最終版本發出，並收到相關文件。李運騰問，但控方有紀錄顯示衞生服務界參選人於6月8日前，收到同一份文件嗎？萬回應：「我們是在談及可以作出的推論。（“What we are talking about is the inference to be drawn.”）」李運騰指余已回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指余簽墨落因是衞生服務界共識-余稱記得其他人無簽&quot;&gt;控方指余簽「墨落」因是衞生服務界共識 余稱記得其他人無簽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，余慧明有讀過提名表格上「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識」的條款，余不同意。而就「墨落無悔」聲明提到戴耀廷於6月9日記者會稱毋須簽協議，余指她當時不知道此事，是簽署「墨落」時才知道。萬德豪問，故「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」一句與余無關？余說「其實都係㗎，不過我想表達我嘅立場係好夠堅定咋嘛」、「我想表達我咁堅定嘅立場畀我嘅選民睇囉」，又指有些簽署者也無參加初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續指出，余慧明簽署「墨落」，是因兩點聲明是其界別候選人的共識，余不同意。李運騰關注，除余慧明外其他衞生服務界候選人有否簽署，余指「我記得就冇嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（28日）續審，余將繼續接受盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s BRICS summit in Johannesburg – bringing together Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa for the first in-person gathering since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic – has seen the usual denunciations of the US and the liberal order which have characterised most of the organisation’s previous gatherings. Russian President Vladimir Putin, attending virtually as he faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes, was quick to blame Western countries for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, stating that “it was the desire to maintain their hegemony in the world, the desire of some countries to maintain this hegemony that led to the severe crisis in Ukraine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenging the US and “the West” has been par for the course for BRICS gatherings in recent years. Originally conceived by Goldman Sachs as a way to capture the economic rise of a diverse group of countries (the BRICS together represent about 40% of the world’s population and a quarter of global GDP), the BRIC acquired a geopolitical significance when Russia took the initiative to convene the four initial member countries in 2009, with South Africa joining in 2011 (adding the S in BRICS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the fanfare around its creation, the BRICS has often seemed more to be muddling along than mounting a systemic challenge to the Western-led international order. While China’s meteoric rise has underpinned the BRICS’s growing share of the world economy, the countries in the group have experienced wide disparities in economic performance. At times, there have also been significant tensions between its members, notably in 2020–21 when China and India were involved in fierce border skirmishes. Amid numerous declarations over the past decade and a half, the bloc’s only tangible accomplishment has been the launching of an international development finance arm, headquartered in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s annual summit produced much of the rhetoric that has led many observers to accuse the BRICS of being merely a talking shop, but the meeting also highlighted how Russia’s war against Ukraine and the growing confrontation between the US and China are injecting a new political impulse into the organisation. Rising geopolitical tensions have brought to the fore the question of how the rest of the world – notably the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America – is aligning with existing and emerging world powers. The BRICS countries, prompted by China and Russia, are now looking to seize this moment to expand the grouping of non-Western states and to fashion it as an alternative to the US-led political and economic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenging-the-mighty-dollar&quot;&gt;Challenging the Mighty Dollar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the increased competition for influence and access in the “Global South”, ahead of the summit there was talk of promoting global “de-dollarisation”, and earlier this year Brazil even floated the idea of a BRICS currency. Dethroning the dollar’s dominance is seen as a key element of building a new global economic order, not least since a number of BRICS countries have been vulnerable to Western economic sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Expansion is viewed in Beijing and Moscow as necessary in order to give the grouping a harder geopolitical edge and to challenge what they characterise as the US-led, unipolar world&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While such ideas currently appear overly ambitious and were not formally on the summit agenda, the BRICS group nevertheless reaffirmed its commitment to expand options for using local currencies for trade between bloc members. Since launching its war against Ukraine, Russia has shifted much of its trade to the renminbi, which now accounts for 16% of its export payments. The BRICS bank recently issued its first rand bond in South Africa, and it is planning to issue its first Indian rupee bond by October. President Lula da Silva of Brazil recently asked: “Why does Brazil need the dollar to trade with China or Argentina? We can trade in our currency”, and he has suggested that the BRICS bank is a more just economic institution than US-led institutions such as the International Monetary Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rise-of-the-pluriverse&quot;&gt;The Rise of the Pluriverse?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Johannesburg summit will provide further momentum to economic coordination among the BRICS, headlines before and after the summit were dominated by efforts led by China and Russia to promote expansion of the bloc’s membership. This is viewed in Beijing and Moscow as necessary in order to give the grouping a harder geopolitical edge, as a means to challenge what they characterise as the US-led, unipolar world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China, an expanding BRICS would present a vehicle for its more “inclusive” worldview, and building up the organisation is viewed as providing a counterweight to the G7 and G20. The Johannesburg summit has been presented by the Chinese state media as building a “pluriversal” world – “a world that is more multipolar, more inclusive, just, equitable, a world that respects the potential and contributions of all countries to human progress”. This suggests that China may be complementing its approach of trying to outcompete the US within existing international institutions by forging something new and more Sino-centric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa, the summit host, supports expansion and invited representatives of dozens of other countries to attend the Johannesburg meeting. Speaking ahead of the summit, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa declared: “An expanded BRICS will represent a diverse group of nations with different political systems that share a common desire to have a more balanced global order”. Concluding the summit, Ramaphosa announced that in a first wave of expansion, six countries had been invited to join the bloc as full members from 1 January 2024: Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement marked an important victory for China and Russia since India and Brazil had previously expressed caution over expanding the bloc. India is wary of China’s potential dominance and of adopting measures that give Beijing a larger international platform for pursuing its ambitions. Brazil is keen to ensure that its influence is not diluted and that it does not find itself being forced to choose sides in the struggle between the US and China and Russia. Ultimately, both were persuaded to support the expansion policy by the inclusion of their “strategic partners” – Argentina for Brazil and the countries of the Gulf for India – in the list of countries invited to join, and an agreement that future expansion would be based on consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking following the conclusion of the summit, China’s President Xi Jinping stated that “This membership expansion is historic”, while Putin observed that “The adoption of the guiding principles in the expansion of BRICS will ensure that the role and importance of BRICS in the world will continue to grow”. Putin announced that the next summit would be hosted by Russia in Kazan, and that he would promote a broadening of the grouping’s agenda to include transport, healthcare, science, and cultural issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While expansion will further the BRICS’ diversity, it will also import more bilateral tensions into the grouping, such as the difficult relationship between Iran and the Gulf states&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision on expansion and further progress on advancing the role of the members’ currencies were significant steps forward for the BRICS countries. Expansion is being presented as a major geopolitical step forward, bringing in key countries in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. For Russia and China, the inclusion of the fiercely anti-Western Iran is seen as a major victory in their efforts to forge a more coherent anti-West grouping to rival the US-led alliance system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evolution-rather-than-revolution-in-johannesburg&quot;&gt;Evolution Rather than Revolution in Johannesburg&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has brought into stark relief the competition for influence and support around the world, and there is strong interest among the BRICS countries in positioning themselves as the champions of “the Global South”. The opportunity to join the BRICS will be viewed positively by many states, especially given the access it will provide to China and to major emerging economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world of intensifying competition, there is also a desire in many countries to use new opportunities in the international system, such as the BRICS, to hedge against the West and enhance their bargaining power. South Africa said that more than 40 countries have expressed interest in joining the BRICS and 22 have formally requested to be admitted. The upbeat assessment of the expansion of the grouping and its broadening ambitions clouds, however, the major challenges that this agenda will bring to the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as a group of five states, the BRICS represents a diverse set of countries more united by what they don’t like – not being able to sit at the international top table – than by a coherent view of their position in the global order or what an alternative global order should look like. The BRICS began as a grouping to limit the “unipolar” moment of US pre-eminence and to promote multipolarity, and there is little appetite in Delhi and Brasilia to transform the organisation into a vehicle of bipolar confrontation with the West. While expansion will further the BRICS’ diversity, it will also import more bilateral tensions into the grouping, such as the difficult relationship between Iran and the Gulf states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, the BRICS has provided a useful platform for emerging states to rail against the injustice of a world order that they felt did not properly include their interests and voices. Expansion is attractive as it will bring in more countries that feel short-changed or excluded by the existing order and strengthen the BRICS as a non-aligned forum. But China and Russia – and now Iran – have bigger ambitions to transform the grouping into a bloc as part of a counter-West project. This will involve moving beyond rhetoric and creating an organisation that can actually deliver an alternative order, tackle major economic problems of development in just ways, and create consensus among states that have deep-seated bilateral disputes with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tall order, and the reality is that while many countries will welcome being part of a grouping that offers an alternative to US-led institutions, few are keen to join an anti-Western geopolitical bloc led by Russia and China. The Johannesburg summit is likely to be remembered as an important moment that reinforced trends toward multipolarity and increased pressure to reform the existing international order’s key institutions. Further expansion of the BRICS is likely to strengthen these trends, but the BRICS still looks far away from becoming the nucleus of a counter-West political movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise in digital assets’ popularity over the last decade has attracted its fair share of illicit actors. Prized for their ease of use and perceived relative anonymity, digital assets such as Bitcoin have become targets for sanctions evaders, criminal enterprises, narcotraffickers and terrorist networks. North Korea, for example, has stolen billions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency in the past five years, in part to fund its WMD programme. Consequently, regulatory, monitoring and enforcement agencies have had to set their sights on addressing the often overlooked space between traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Despite modest progress addressing key vulnerabilities that cryptocurrency creates for global finance, the dynamic and rapidly changing nature of digital assets requires new thought about risk and sources of risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One increasingly difficult problem for regulatory and monitoring authorities is how to address and mitigate risks associated with cryptocurrency mining (the processes used to verify transactions). Unlike traditional cryptocurrency exchanges, mining typically falls outside the scope of anti-money-laundering (AML) regulatory authorities and can provide illicit actors with a stream of nearly anonymous – and possibly unlimited – revenue. Unfortunately, discussions on how to best mitigate these risks is largely absent from broader policy discussions on regulating and monitoring digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper, intended for policymakers and those with compliance obligations, seeks to broaden the discussions of risk around cryptocurrency by providing a typology of risks related to cryptocurrency mining. The objective is not to provide an all-encompassing snapshot of cryptocurrency mining activities, but to offer a general framework for policymakers to consider and mitigate a range of risks that may not be immediately apparent. The paper also places the described typologies within the context of recent or emerging regulatory and enforcement actions, to highlight gaps and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper concludes with a series of recommendations aimed at mitigating risks and addressing regulatory and monitoring shortfalls in relation to cryptocurrency mining, consistent with global AML standards. These include, for example, modifying registration requirements for commercial and remote mining enterprises so that they fall under the purview of regulatory frameworks, despite outstanding questions over custody of cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is abundantly clear that illicit actors have focused in on the usefulness of cryptocurrency, and it is quite likely that cryptocurrency will feature in financial crime for decades to come. Given the uniqueness, novelty and rapidly evolving nature of the digital assets industry, however, it is critically important that policymakers continue to think outside the box, re-examine previously held assumptions about the nature of risks associated with cryptocurrency – including mining – and continuously adapt regulatory and monitoring frameworks in response to emerging risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was once considered a fringe, novel technology, virtual assets – that is, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin – now have a global market capitalisation of more than $1 trillion. The sheer scale and scope of the cryptocurrency industry, paired with regulation and monitoring challenges, have created, over the past decade, opportunities for illicit state and non-state actors to facilitate financial crimes, including sanctions evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing, among others, using cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the international organisation responsible for setting anti-money-laundering (AML) and counterterrorist-finance (CTF) standards, set about addressing threats posed by digital assets to the international financial system. However, despite the introduction of several new requirements, including a requirement for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to be “regulated for (anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism) AML/CTF purposes, and licensed or registered, and subject to effective systems for monitoring … or supervision”, key vulnerabilities and gaps remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these gaps is cryptocurrency mining, which is generally not covered by AML rules and regulations. Mining cryptocurrency is the process by which users verify the accuracy of transactions on a blockchain and are subsequently rewarded for their efforts with newly minted cryptocurrency. Due to the fundamental design of this decentralised process, little in the way of information is available to national authorities on who has “mined” cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there is very little in the way of transparency on miners, mining has attracted illicit actors ranging from narcotics traffickers to sanctions evaders such as North Korea. In 2019, for example, a report by the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea found that the country engaged in mining cryptocurrencies to generate revenue for its military programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper offers jurisdictions a typology of laundering through cryptocurrency mining. The objective is to increase overall awareness of money-laundering and proliferation-finance risks posed by mining, as well as guidance on how to best address these threats from a legal and regulatory perspective. Although this paper is not meant to be comprehensive, it aims to expand on these identified threats so that jurisdictions can detect vulnerabilities in their financial systems and form risk mitigation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper first outlines general financial crime risks associated with cryptocurrency mining that have occurred since Bitcoin’s start. Next, it presents a typology of cryptocurrency mining risks, designed to illustrate how illicit actors can take advantage of existing and emerging mining to facilitate money laundering and proliferation financing. Finally, the paper concludes with an analysis of the legal and regulatory challenges to responding to mining risks, and their implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mining has attracted illicit actors ranging from narcotics traffickers to sanctions evaders&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typologies outlined in this paper are based on a series of semi-structured interviews with public and private stakeholders, including representatives of VASPs, blockchain analytics companies, compliance specialists and academics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These interviews, along with a review of relevant news articles, guidance released by international organisations and other law enforcement and regulatory actions, have helped to inform case studies and risk mitigation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-cryptocurrency-mining-risks&quot;&gt;UNDERSTANDING CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING RISKS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FATF defines virtual assets as “a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or investment purposes”. Bitcoin, for example, one of the most recognised and earliest virtual assets, was first conceptualised in 2008 as a decentralised currency – that is, free of a central monetary authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decentralised digital currency, however, faces a significant hurdle: without a central authority, how can users be assured that the record of transactions is complete and accurate? To solve this problem, Bitcoin and other similar types of cryptocurrencies use a “proof-of-work” model to validate and record transactions on a blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blockchain, or ledger, consists of blocks of transactions linked together. In a proof-of-work model, a user, referred to as a cryptocurrency miner, employs computer processing power (or “work”) to solve a computationally complex mathematical problem that effectively ensures transactions are accurate and in the correct order – that is, that each new block is linked to the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work, however, is not free. To incentivise users to keep the ledger accurate, miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin). Miners compete against other miners to be the first to solve the complex problem and the first miner to do so is permitted to record the next block of transactions. Figure 1 illustrates how new blocks of transactions are added to a given blockchain that uses a “proof-of-work” model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, mining increases the overall supply of cryptocurrency. Minting new cryptocurrency through mining, however, creates several pernicious problems from a financial crime perspective. Namely, newly minted cryptocurrency is not easily linked to an individual. Because of this, mining cryptocurrency is an attractive target for enterprising criminal organisations, sanctions evaders and those looking to avoid law enforcement and intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, for example, an investigation by Brazil’s Department of Narcotics uncovered a cryptocurrency mining operation as part of a drug enforcement investigation, shining a light on how criminal organisations are adapting to digital currencies. Similarly, in Argentina, there have been reports of crime associated with illicitly obtaining cryptocurrency mining equipment, either to launder funds or to make money from reselling the equipment at a lower price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s brazen cyber attacks against cryptocurrency businesses and applications, which have netted the country billions of dollars in cryptocurrency, are now well known. According to a 2019 UN report, North Korea has also been involved in mining cryptocurrency since at least May 2017. In February 2020, a cyber-security firm found that North Korea’s mining activity had increased at least tenfold since May 2019, based on an analysis of a North Korea-linked IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While converting stolen cryptocurrency to fiat currency requires a multi-step laundering process that runs the risk of detection, mining, on the other hand, has the potential to generate a nearly anonymous revenue stream. The ability to generate practically decoupled revenue is an enticing lure to illicit activity. Indeed, as illustrated in the next section, there has been a significant increase in the scale and scope of illicit activity targeting the cryptocurrency mining process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mining industry, however, is not static. Much like virtual currency, mining encompasses rapidly changing and dynamic technologies. To better understand how illicit actors can exploit mining, the next section provides a series of typologies and case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-cryptocurrency-mining-typologies&quot;&gt;KEY CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING TYPOLOGIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section describes a range of available cryptocurrency mining typologies, which includes cryptojacking and remote mining. These methods pose a challenge to law enforcement and regulatory authorities because they involve an individual receiving newly minted cryptocurrency that is not tied to previous transactions, thus making user identification more difficult. Such coins can then be converted to fiat currency without detection of a criminal link on the blockchain. The fourth typology in this section focuses on cryptocurrencies that use a “proof-of-stake” transaction verification model. Although this model does not provide a viable laundering mechanism, it is a method that illicit actors can use to generate revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;typology-1-cryptojacking&quot;&gt;TYPOLOGY 1: CRYPTOJACKING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the steep costs of specialised equipment, or sometimes a lack of access to stable internet or power grids, criminals have turned to cryptojacking – the process of hijacking another user’s computer processing power to mine cryptocurrency without their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, for example, a researcher used supercomputers funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF – an independent federal government agency) to mine Bitcoin, resulting in his suspension from working with the US government. According to an audit report, “the researcher misused over $150,000 in NSF-supported computer usage at two universities to generate Bitcoins valued between $8,000 and $10,000”. Later, from 2017 to 2021, this illicit revenue generation method grew in popularity as demand and price for cryptocurrency increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browser-based cryptojacking, or “drive-by mining”, likewise grew in popularity. The process involves embedding malicious code in a website, which allows the website owner to use visitors’ computer processing power to mine cryptocurrency. While there are legitimate reasons a website owner may include web-based mining on a website – such as generating revenue for a charity – criminal enterprises, extremists or even sanctions evaders can exploit the same method to generate revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, for example, a neo-Nazi militant group known as the Order of Dawn allowed supporters to mine Monero to generate revenue for its volunteer army. The group’s website is shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dnh7zwk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Order of Dawn and Cryptocurrency Mining.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.counterextremism.com/blog/far-right-european-terrorist-group-crowdfunding-cryptocurrency&quot;&gt;Counter Extremism Project, “Far-Right European Terrorist Group Crowdfunding Cryptocurrency”, 28 April 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptojacking can also occur on a larger scale by rerouting unwitting users’ computer processing power to a mining “pool”, which functions as an aggregator for computer processing power. This method has the potential to create a nearly anonymous revenue stream for an illicit actor. Alternatively, it is also possible to target and hijack resources from cryptocurrency mining pools. In 2014, a hacker gained access to a Canadian internet provider and rerouted traffic from a legitimate pool to a malicious pool, which netted nearly US$84,000 worth of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptojacking has similarly caught the attention of North Korea. One of the first reported cases of North Korea-linked criminal activity associated with cryptojacking occurred in 2017, when cyber-criminals hacked a South Korean company’s server to illicitly mine Monero. North Korea was able to mine nearly 70 Monero coins, worth approximately $25,000 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea is also alleged to have employed malware to infect computers to mine Monero. According to a 2019 UN report, analysts were able to trace the mined Monero back to servers located at Kim Il Sung University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;typology-2-commercial-mining-facilities&quot;&gt;TYPOLOGY 2: COMMERCIAL MINING FACILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-scale mining operations have become a lucrative business in recent years, and although the exact number of commercial mining facilities worldwide is unknown, the scale and scope of the industry can be estimated by the demand that such facilities place on power grids. A 2022 report by the US Office of Science and Technology Policy, which coordinates interagency science and technology policy efforts, found that commercial mining facilities are on the rise, estimating that the “total global estimated electricity usage for blockchains that support crypto-assets in 2022 falls into a range of 120 to 240 billion kWh per year”. While such estimates can fluctuate considerably according to demand within cryptocurrency markets, this nonetheless highlights the sheer magnitude of such operations, which at times has accounted for nearly 1% of global energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining facilities also have the capability to provide illicit actors with a substantial and relatively anonymous revenue stream. Mined cryptocurrency can be moved across jurisdictions through peer-to-peer transactions and potentially converted to fiat currency at cryptocurrency businesses worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capital costs of such ventures can, however, be high. Specialised equipment, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), can cost anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands of US dollars. In at least one case, illicit actors have used the crypto-mining process to launder other ill-gotten gains, as shown in the following case study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-case-study-bitcoin-mining-centres-and-crime&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1: Case Study: Bitcoin Mining Centres and Crime&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2016, Spanish police and tax authorities arrested 30 individuals suspected of laundering illicit proceeds via Bitcoin mining centres. The authorities seized Bitcoin mining centres that they suspected were being used by a large criminal network to launder funds. The amount of funds laundered through the operation is unknown.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyc360.riskscreen.com/article/on-the-periphery-financial-crime-risks-in-cryptocurrency-mining/&quot;&gt;Dev Odedra and Chris Gschwend, “On the Periphery: Financial Crime Risks in Cryptocurrency Mining”, KYC360, 13 July 2020&lt;/a&gt;; Reuters, “Spain Arrests 30 Suspected of Laundering Money in Bitcoin Centres”, 25 May 2016.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;State actors have also focused on large-scale mining facilities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 3 provides a notional summary of how criminal networks could feasibly invest in mining equipment that can ultimately provide revenue that is decoupled from any illicit activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZTAKq9J.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Mining as a Laundry Service.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: A criminal uses illicit funds to purchase or rent a mining “rig”. In return, they receive clean cryptocurrency and can transfer funds across jurisdictions or convert them to fiat currency at exchanges with limited detection. By contrast, on regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, the criminal in question would still face the need to surpass controls during the customer onboarding procedure. Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to criminal networks, state actors have also focused on large-scale mining facilities, requesting that the proceeds be sold to a central bank. Iran, for example, used this technique to generate revenue while under sanctions, according to several blockchain analytics firms. Furthermore, the head of Iran’s Trade Promotion Organization has said that the country’s central bank had made a proposal for how Iran can “use the cryptocurrencies produced internally or cryptocurrencies purchased by companies such as the private sector” for the import of goods. Similarly, although the full extent of North Korea’s mining operations is unknown, its 2020 efforts to mine Monero demonstrate, at a minimum, an interest in conducting mining operations on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are several elements necessary for a successful commercial operation and, therefore, the extent of this financial crime risk will vary among jurisdictions. First and foremost is whether there is access to stable and cheap power. According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, mining farm operators generally choose locations with lower electricity costs to optimise profit. In addition to cheap power, commercial facilities also require stable access to the internet that can accommodate transferring data at high speeds. Climate can also play a role. Mining is preferred in regions with low temperatures, which can help operators avoid substantial cooling costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demand for cryptocurrency has increased, many states have considered and enacted policies to attract the crypto-mining industry. One such example is Transnistria, an unrecognised republic situated between Ukraine and Moldova. The unrecognised breakaway state adopted legislation in 2018 to legalise cryptocurrency mining and created incentives to attract parts of the industry. In addition to offering cheap, stable energy, Transnistria also allows entrepreneurs to set up a mining facility without needing to register as a local company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;typology-3-remote-mining&quot;&gt;TYPOLOGY 3: REMOTE MINING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rising costs of specialised mining equipment, as well as the need for cheap power and stable internet infrastructure, have prompted the formation of businesses that host mining equipment on behalf of customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote mining presents a particularly thorny problem when it comes to combating financial crime. Operators of remote mining services may be unaware of their client’s identity or whether they are acting on behalf of a third party, as they are often located in different jurisdictions. This could mean that a remote mining service could unwittingly facilitate sanctions evasion or other types of illicit activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Host mining facilities, for example, allow remote customers to purchase mining rigs hosted on their property. The overhead costs for a hosting service typically comprise electricity and maintenance costs, including the setup of the mining equipment. Once the rig is operating, all earnings are directly transferred to the wallet that the customer has listed – whether their own or a third party’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One host mining facility, Bitriver, fell onto the US sanctions list in 2022. BitRiver and its subsidiaries were alleged to have aided Russia in monetising its natural resources by leveraging the country’s cheap energy to mine cryptocurrency. Prior to unilateral sanctions, BitRiver created a cryptocurrency known as the BTR Token. Holders of the coin receive an equivalent amount of electricity power for their hosted mining equipment and can submit tokens once a month to pay up to 10% of the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar manner, host mining facilities typically allow a portion of the electricity costs to be paid in cryptocurrency, which could provide avenues for criminal organisations and sanctions evaders to launder the proceeds of crime. It would be quite feasible for a representative operating on behalf of a sanctioned country to pay for electricity costs with illicit funds, and in return receive mined cryptocurrency decoupled from any criminal link. Notably, if traceable cryptocurrency is used to pay for a portion of the mining fees, investigators can still track the funds to the business that accepted the illicit funds. However, the facility may be based in a jurisdiction that is not cooperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some commercial mining facilities also offer cloud-based mining services, whereby users can lease equipment and computer time. Some of the primary cloud-based mining services allow payment in cryptocurrency and for the receiving cryptocurrency address to be changed after purchase. The benefit of using such services is that it can help reduce long-term costs, including investments in expensive equipment, as well as provide a solution to those in jurisdictions with geographic, energy, legal or other limitations on mining. Like host mining, the user does not need to be physically located in the jurisdiction to reap the rewards of mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If information is needed, it is likely that the cloud-based mining service would keep a database of cryptocurrency addresses used by the customer. However, depending on whether the service obtains custody of the funds, it can be unclear to investigators where the funds then move to, when looking at on-chain activity. This form of laundering is outlined in the following case study of a North Korea-linked cyber group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-2-case-study-north-korea-and-cloud-mining-services&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 2: Case Study: North Korea and Cloud Mining Services&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In March 2023, Mandiant, a US cyber security firm, released a report on the cryptocurrency laundering methods of APT43, a North Korea-linked cyber group. According to Mandiant, APT43 likely uses hash rental (the rental of a set amount of computing power to mine cryptocurrency) and cloud-based mining services as a method of laundering funds. The process of laundering via hash rental and cloud-based mining services allows for the buyer’s original payments and the mined cryptocurrency to be decoupled.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The user does not need to be in the jurisdiction to reap the rewards&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another cloud mining model involves peer-to-peer marketplaces that allow payments in cryptocurrency. For these services, the buyer can mine using the seller’s computer processing power. Of course, this can also create problems – especially from a transparency perspective. Operators of cloud mining services such as these generally have, for example, no insights into their users’ activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;typology-4-proof-of-stake-model&quot;&gt;TYPOLOGY 4: PROOF-OF-STAKE MODEL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas a proof-of-work model requires miners to solve computationally complex problems to verify the accuracy of a blockchain and record new transactions, the proof-of-stake model requires validators to “stake” their own cryptocurrency as collateral to verify transactions. To confirm a transaction, the blockchain network randomly selects a validator based on the number of coins the user has staked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jtDBZWU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Proof-of-Stake Model.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: An individual stakes their own funds and, when chosen, will verify transactions on the blockchain. Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, proof-of-stake mining is less energy- and resource-intensive than a proof-of-work model. For these reasons, it may be more attractive to illicit actors. North Korea, for example, has a large stock of cryptocurrency from its various hacks over the past five years that the country could feasibly stake – effectively allowing it to “earn interest” on its illicit hacking operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Ethereum, a blockchain-enabled platform that allows smart contracts, shifted its economic model from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake to reduce environmental impact. For many illicit actors, this move could prove a boost to revenue generation. A recent report by Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs noted that while North Korea has not previously mined Ether, the shift to a proof-of-stake model may prove more attractive for revenue generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staking coins, along with cryptojacking, commercial mining facilities and remote mining, represent avenues for criminals to circumvent regulations or take advantage of a lack of oversight. Despite the difficulty of identifying users behind the transaction verification process, the public and private sectors can take steps to mitigate potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regulatory-response-implications-and-solutions&quot;&gt;REGULATORY RESPONSE, IMPLICATIONS AND SOLUTIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preceding analysis of key crypto-mining typologies – cryptojacking, commercial mining, remote mining and staking – shows that, despite global interest in regulating digital assets, significant risks to the global financial system remain. In most cases, crypto mining does not fall within the purview of financial supervisors or AML frameworks. The following section addresses some of these legal and regulatory challenges, as well as their implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, only a handful of countries have addressed cryptocurrency mining within their sectoral risk assessments. Moreover, of those that have attempted to tackle mining, regulatory approaches have varied considerably. In some jurisdictions, for example, legislation explicitly states that cryptocurrency mining activity is outside the scope of AML rules and regulations, while in other jurisdictions, miners are subject to licensing and registration requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulatory-approaches&quot;&gt;REGULATORY APPROACHES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the many challenges is the fact that cryptocurrency mining businesses do not generally retain custody of the mined cryptocurrency. This means they do not generally fit into the category of financial institutions that fall under the purview of the FATF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of the FATF, “natural or legal persons that solely engage in the operation of a VA [virtual assets] network and do not engage in or facilitate any of the activities or operations of a VASP on behalf of their customers … are not VASPs”, even if those activities are undertaken as part of their business. Examples provided by the FATF of activities that would not in themselves qualify an entity to be considered a VASP include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offering customers internet network services and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing computing resources (“cloud services and creating, validating, and broadcasting blocks of transactions”).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China banned mining outright in 2021&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the report notes that those that do not fall under the definition of a VASP include “validators … whose functions are only validating transactions and cloud service providers whose functions are only offering the operation of infrastructure”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide further clarification on these requirements, countries have taken steps to release guidance on crypto mining. However, in the US, for example, little has been done in the way of modernising AML rules and regulations related to crypto mining. Current guidance, put forward by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the key agency responsible for countering money laundering in the US, is now nearly a decade old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guidance, unfortunately, does not take into account crypto-mining businesses, noting that “to the extent that a user mines Bitcoin and uses the Bitcoin solely for the user’s own purposes and not for the benefit of another, the user is not an MSB [money service business] under FinCEN’s regulations”. Thus, a crypto-mining company is typically not considered an MSB, and as such is not required to implement AML rules and regulations, such as know-your-customer procedures and record-keeping requirements, which are commonplace at banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some countries have taken drastically different approaches. China, for example, banned mining outright in 2021. Prior to the ban, nearly 50% of global Bitcoin mining occurred in China. In response to the new restrictions, cryptocurrency mining companies relocated to other jurisdictions, including Russia, Kazakhstan, Iran and the US. Despite the ban, however, an analysis of hash rates, which can be a proxy for measuring total levels of mining, indicate that there are still mining operations in mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following subsections offer recommendations that countries should consider to restrict abuse of this type of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consider the Risk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall lack of rules around businesses that offer crypto-mining services poses a problem for securing the international financial system against illicit actors. The typologies outlined in this paper detail various methods that criminal networks and sanctions evaders can exploit to generate relatively “clean” streams of revenue – that is, revenue not linked to a specific criminal group or individual or prohibited activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the risks posed to the international financial system, states should, at a minimum, consider their relative risk exposure to crypto mining from a cyber security standpoint, and identify associated risk with businesses within the industry. This includes understanding the scale and scope of mining-centric businesses within their jurisdiction, which is not always straightforward – especially if there are no registration or licensing requirements. At a minimum, countries should include their crypto-mining industries within national risk assessments.42 To aid with understanding risk and mitigation strategies, operators of crypto-mining enterprises should be included in domestic public–private partnerships centred on cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jurisdictions should be especially concerned if sanctions evasion or other types of illicit financial activity have previously been associated with their jurisdiction. It is important to note that countries have an obligation to implement and enforce international sanctions. In the case of North Korea, for example, states are required to prevent the provision of financial services or economic resources to North Korea. While crypto-mining services may not fit neatly within the definition of a “financial service”, they are nonetheless an economic resource that North Korea could exploit to support its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understand Regional Risk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor countries should consider is regional risk exposure. There could be negative spillover effects from neighbouring jurisdictions that incentivise crypto-mining businesses, such as by offering cheap energy or establishing free trade zones with favourable crypto-mining laws. For example, a country with little or no crypto-mining activity but active cryptocurrency exchanges may face significant risks from illicit actors mining in one region and cashing out in another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collect and Verify Beneficial Ownership Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries need to identify and verify individuals who have ownership and control of crypto-mining facilities located in their jurisdictions. As shown in the second section, illicit actors can exploit such facilities for laundering or sanctions evasion purposes, so it is critical to identify who is behind operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FATF outlines that countries should take measures to prevent the misuse of corporate vehicles for criminal purposes by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding the risk associated with legal arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making legal persons and legal arrangements sufficiently transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Requiring corporate vehicles to provide accurate and up-to-date basic and beneficial ownership information to competent authorities in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, to detect large-scale mining facilities that are not registered as businesses, law enforcement can look at spikes in energy consumption, as the proof-of-work mining process requires a substantial amount of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Require Customer Identification and Verification&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries should also consider modifying registration requirements for commercial and remote mining enterprises. At a minimum, regulatory authorities should require these companies to retain customer identifying information for law enforcement purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most types of crypto-mining activities would not meet the definition of a VASP, and thus not be subject to AML rules and regulations, collection of customer information by remote crypto-mining businesses is highly recommended. By undertaking the following checks on remote clients when establishing business relations these facilities can ensure sanctions compliance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recording the full name, date of birth, nationality and address of the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verifying the information provided to ensure the use of official government identification documents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keeping a record of cryptocurrency addresses used by the customer to receive generated funds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If illicitly obtained funds are linked to the remote crypto-mining business, holding this customer information will aid in law enforcement investigations. Furthermore, these facilities need to ensure they do not accept funds from sanctioned entities by screening customer information against relevant sanctions lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criminal networks and state actors have both used crypto mining to generate nearly anonymous streams of revenue. While the scale and scope of these illicit operations is largely unknown, the risk posed to the international financial system is clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a rapidly evolving industry, new innovations also bring new opportunities for illicit actors to exploit, and governments are failing to recognise risks associated with mining. To mitigate the risks that mining can generate, it will be important for governments to think outside traditional AML frameworks. Defining a crypto-mining company as an MSB, for example, may be akin to trying to place a square peg in a round hole.

  &lt;li&gt;余慧明指中共立《國安法》「炒熟香港人」 官質疑煽動仇恨&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;余慧明稱《國安法》為「惡法」 官：就算唔鍾意都唔可以觸犯&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第113天。余慧明繼續作供，就《國安法》宣布實施後所撰的〈迷霧裡 黑夜終於響起號角聲〉，余解釋撰文是望港人「唔好對《國安法》淨係得個恐懼」，而是應繼續思考如何合法抗爭。法官陳仲衡關注文中「中共已按捺不住直接炒熟香港人」是否煽動對中共的仇恨，余否認，指只是陳述中共將《國安法》「加插」在《基本法》附件三，無經本地諮詢便在港實施；又形容是「中共單方面炒香港人」，嚇怕外資、令經濟不穩，猶如向港人開戰。余亦指很多港人不贊成《國安法》，但港府無將意見向中央表達，法官李運騰笑說報紙每天都有報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又表示，曾預期被DQ和取消選舉，但無想過「連議會都未入去就拉人」；她亦強調若政府拒絕談判，會反對所有議案，「我認為投下一票反對票係冇錯㗎。」余亦確認衞生服務界無召開過協調會議，她不曾收過及看過協調文件，最終亦因選民資格認證爭議令該界別初選結果不具約束力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱衞生服務界無召協調會議不曾收過及看過界別協調文件&quot;&gt;余稱衞生服務界無召協調會議、不曾收過及看過界別協調文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選衞生服務界的前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明繼續作供，余昨稱2020年4月曾問戴耀廷能否「順便」辦衞生服務界初選，獲戴回覆視乎可能性。她今續確認6月9日前無與組織者和其他候選人見面，她是當天記者會後，才獲競選團隊告知戴會上宣布衞生服務界也會有初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/emNwJ37.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年6月9日 35+記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又指，衞生服務界無開過協調會議，戴耀廷亦沒有與她提過其他選區討論過的題目；就「35+計劃」和「民主派衞生服務界協調機制協議」文件，余被捕前均無收過也無看過，而就文件所有內容，「我哋都冇傾過點樣可以代表到我哋有個協議喺度」，因她向戴稱想辦初選的原因，只是想選出一人代表民主派出選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文件提及衞生服務界有兩個指定票站，余指戴耀廷原曾提及有4個，但因街工退出初選而減至3個，戴有在6月24日創立的衞生服務界 WhatsApp 群組提及，群組成員還包括余慧明、李國麟、劉凱文、袁偉傑4名候選人，及趙家賢、鍾錦麟和時任民主動力總幹事黎敬輝，余同意該群組是與組織者溝通的唯一渠道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱無就替補及棄選機制與組織者討論棄選機制無協議&quot;&gt;余稱無就替補及棄選機制與組織者討論、棄選機制無協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就替補機制和棄選機制，余指無與組織者討論，但她認為如勝出後不幸被DQ，「我係應該可以指明另一個人去代替我出選」，同意即「靈童制」，不過她庭上才知道此名字；又指她於初選後曾約其他候選人開會，但只得劉凱文出席，她有向劉提出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tJ0M1lk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余亦指就棄選機制，即落敗者不准參與正式選舉，並沒有協議，她認為有人「輸咗初選都照參選」的情況「避免唔到」，「但我就可以出嚟話佢哋出嚟鎅票，咁既然大家都應該會譴責佢哋依個行徑嘅話，咁佢地就會輸囉。」陳慶偉發笑，李運騰亦說那或是余的願望，但有否與其他候選人達成協議？余說「協議唔到」，亦不知棄選機制是計劃的一部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，余有從任何途徑得悉初選有棄選機制嗎？余說「我唔知『墨落無悔』算唔算」，但除此以外則沒有。陳慶偉問那「三投三不投」呢？余說沒有，稱接近投票日時才聽過，「但我冇關心佢呢個 programme 搞緊啲咩，因為我自己都好忙碌。」李運騰問余是否得悉「三投三不投」曾在《蘋果日報》賣頭版廣告，余指在審訊文件夾才看過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱組織者決定初選結果無約束力參與者無可奈何&quot;&gt;余稱組織者決定初選結果無約束力、參與者無可奈何&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余其後表示，2020年7月10日、初選投票前一日，衞生服務界群組內4名初選參與者與組織者，曾就選民資格認證發生爭議，當時有四個方案，他們花很多時間討論，但「達唔成一個共識」，組織者最終決定用方案三，即投票者出示職員證就可證明是該界別人士，但初選結果對參選人「不具規範性」、「冇約束性」，並叫民主動力將決定發布給所有人，指衞生服務界初選結果「只供參考」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Myd0V4z.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 余慧明（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余並指，「依個係大會主辦單位所選擇嘅結果，我哋係無可奈何囉」、「我哋都唔滿意㗎」，指她自己希望結果有約束性，而李國麟則無明確表示要有約束性。余並指事後曾發文解釋自己立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱合法抗爭為重要考慮罷工曾問法律顧問意見&quot;&gt;余稱「合法」抗爭為重要考慮、罷工曾問法律顧問意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示余慧明5月23日於《香港獨立媒體網》刊出的〈迷霧裡 黑夜終於響起號角聲〉，余指同由她於 Facebook 專頁發布，獨媒轉載，撰文背景是當時人大已公布會就「港版國安法」立法，她「希望香港人唔好對《國安法》淨係得個恐懼」、「覺得做咩都冇用」，「應該繼續去思考點樣可以合法地抗爭」，「爭取我哋一直追求嘅民主、真普選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余同意，「合法」對她來說是重要考慮，她在2020年初組織醫護罷工亦有考慮，「因為我始終係一個工會嘅代表，所以我好着重我自己做嘅嘢係咪符合法律嘅容許之下嘅」，而當時「為咗保障我啲會員」，她有確保整個罷工程序符合法律程序，亦有問過法律顧問意見。石書銘問，抗爭的合法性考慮對余有多重要？余微微發笑並湊前咪高峰：「好重要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱立國安法非攬炒為中共單方面炒香港人&quot;&gt;余稱立《國安法》非「攬炒」、為中共「單方面炒香港人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文章提及「中共已按捺不住直接炒熟香港人，任誰也不能置身事外」，法官陳仲衡關注，余用中共「炒熟」港人的字眼，會否煽動（stir up）對中共的仇恨？余不認為會，解釋因她只是陳述中共將《國安法》「加插」在《基本法》附件三的決定，即「唔需要經過本地嘅立法、亦都冇經過本地嘅一啲諮詢，直接就可以喺香港度實施」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳仲衡質疑，余並非陳述事實，而是用「炒熟」一詞。余解釋，因當時有人用「攬炒」形容此行為，「但我唔認為依個係一個攬炒，因為依個係中共單方面炒香港人」，故使用「炒熟」，並解釋認為中共行為可能嚇怕外資、令經濟不穩定，令香港無法維持「國際大都會」的名譽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余奮力迎戰對手為政府先傾後砌為爭取平等對話機會&quot;&gt;余「奮力迎戰」對手為政府、「先傾後砌」為爭取「平等」對話機會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文章提到「面對中共赤裸裸上陣，香港人只可奮力迎戰。各路戰線，要堅持去做」，余解釋「奮力迎戰」指要繼續以不同戰線抗爭。李運騰指要戰鬥便需有對手，余的對手是誰？余思考了一會說：「當時嘅語境係政府囉，係拒絕聆聽民意嘅政府」，解釋因當時很多香港市民也不贊成《國安法》實施，「但香港政府係冇將依個意見表達畀中央。」李運騰笑說，「報紙每日都有報導。（“It was reported at the newspaper everyday.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，戰爭是關乎生死，余將政府視為對手，是排除任何談判的可能嗎？余說「絕對不是」，陳慶偉笑問，即「先砌後傾」？（余昨稱自己願談判，但會「先砌後傾」，解釋「砌」是擺出高姿態，事先宣揚反對一切議案。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余今重申，這是一種高姿態談判手段，「但係最重要係政府必須放下佢高高在上嘅身段，佢先可以同我哋一齊傾囉，即係我哋唔會關閉咗我哋嘅溝通大門。」陳慶問，即余為了令政府放低身段，會「先砌後傾」？余指認為是可行方法，指是要爭取一個「平等啲」的對話機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱反對所有議案為擺高姿態談判認為投下一票反對票係冇錯嘅&quot;&gt;余稱反對所有議案為擺高姿態談判、認為「投下一票反對票係冇錯嘅」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章稱「當初要爭取議會過半，全面反枱，迫使政權解散立法會進行破局。這個目標一日未達成，一日亦要堅持，哪怕政權DQ也好，取消選舉亦好，目的只為向全界都揭示香港人已失去昔日人權與自由。」，余指「全面反枱」指她「會繼續全面將所有嘅議案係投反對票」，「我哋係要反客為主，將個話語權攞返去自己手上。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，余使用的語言如何表達她是準備好談判的訊息？余指無很明確展示，「因為我係要展示我要擺出一個好高嘅姿態，同政府談判。」李追問，會高到令人認為她不準備談判嗎？余指不會，舉例醫護罷工時他們與政府同樣擺出好高的姿態，「但係事實上，其實係有一個 negotiation 出現咗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指那或是罷工的情況，但重申余文中無提「談判」，讀者或認為其主張與戴耀廷「攬炒十步」類似，令特首下台、國際制裁、中共倒台。余先指「我係冇睇過戴耀廷嗰個攬炒十部曲」，而且「我係想向選民同埋公眾展現我嘅決心，唔會輕易退讓，但我唔會將我嘅談判嘅策略都擺埋出嚟畀人睇㗎嘛」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，但余是威脅（threat）政府談判？余即說：「我冇 threat 喎，我用『迫使』咋喎，如果你話用 threat，我應該話威脅政權解散（立法會）㗎啦喎」，指這是她對文字的理解。余續同意，她是迫使政府談判，向其訴求妥協。陳仲衡問，而如政府不這樣做，余就會做出文中所言的行為？余同意，指「我認為投下一票反對票係冇錯㗎」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱曾預想dq和取消選舉-但無想過票都未投就拉&quot;&gt;余稱曾預想DQ和取消選舉 但無想過「票都未投就拉」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「哪怕政權DQ也好，取消選舉亦好」，辯方問余慧明當時還預期政府採取其他行動嗎？余說「嗰陣時淨係諗到嗰兩樣嘢，冇諗過會拉人囉，即係連議會都未入去就拉人咁樣，即係票都未投就拉咁樣」，並在法官追問下指，即她成功當選並「喺投下反對票之前，已經畀人拉咗喇」。余又指，就她提及的有機會取消選舉「事實上亦都發生咗吖」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指要有心理準備爭民主路很長和平抗爭亦消耗大體力&quot;&gt;余指要有心理準備爭民主路很長、和平抗爭亦消耗大體力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「大家必須作好生理與心理準備，要不做順民，不再發聲；否則，便奮力迎接與中共的背水一戰！」，余解釋「心理準備」是要有準備「爭取民主之路會好長」；至於「生理準備」，「我絕對唔係話鼓吹緊大家要上街，即係街頭抗爭嗰啲」，而是進行和平的抗爭手法也會消耗很大體力。石書銘一度問是暴力抑或非暴力抗爭，余指是較暴力的示威，但強調「依樣嘢都係視乎返警方用暴力鎮壓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續解釋就和平抗爭，如罷工需要很多不同持分者溝通，包括醫管局高層、政府、會員、公眾和傳媒，該過程「好費心力」，尤其前兩者「唔聽我哋嘅說話」更費其心神。余又指如2019年6月16日的遊行，由起點行到終點也要至少6至8小時，如每星期都有，大家都需要一個「好強健嘅體魄」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;文章提背水一戰-余稱反抗不一定使用暴力戰爭都會有negotiation&quot;&gt;文章提「背水一戰」 余稱反抗不一定使用暴力、「戰爭都會有negotiation」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「奮力迎接與中共的背水一戰」，陳慶偉問是否即一條「不歸路（road with no return）」，因「背水」指身後有河流，只能向前戰鬥。余先說看不到此解說，又指向前行不代表一定要戰鬥，並解釋她是「首尾呼應」文中早前提到「面對中共赤裸裸上陣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，因此余也是談及「先砌後傾」？余一度不同意，指因中共已實施《國安法》，她比喻此行為「已經向香港人開戰喇」，而他們只是「做一個反抗」，不代表一定使用暴力行為，「咁你戰爭入面都會有 negotiation 啦。」陳說他就是提議余文章的意思也是「先砌後傾」，但余卻稱不同意，「我在給你出路（“I’m giving you a way out.”）」，余說：「OK，我 get 到喇」，多名被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方再問余是否預期談判，余重申「我係會有 negotiation」，無寫明是因不想將談判手段「擺埋出嚟畀人睇」，但又不想令公眾認為她很易退讓，不同意她無論如何也不會退讓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱從無發表要求外國制裁言論&quot;&gt;余稱從無發表要求外國制裁言論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於文中提到「國際戰線」，余昨解釋是透過媒體向國際社會展示香港發生街頭運動、醫護於疫情罷工的原因，都是政府拒絕聆聽民意，而她望國際輿論令港府有壓力，如想維持香港國際都會地位和聲譽，就要停止高壓手段鎮壓人民、聆聽訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余今指，文中意思與昨日解釋相若，引起國際關注是其原意，「可以引到幾多關注就另計囉」，並強調「我從來都冇發表過要求外國制裁嘅言論」，只是希望政府感受到壓力下聆聽民意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指政府無法運作指公務員罷工稱受基本法保障&quot;&gt;余指「政府無法運作」指公務員罷工、稱受《基本法》保障&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中亦提到：「有效的三罷是不設時限的，直至社會停擺，政府無法運作，必須回應訴求為止」，就「政府無法運作」，余解釋是其想像，若公務員也參與罷工應會影響政府部門運作，但要視乎規模，亦同意是談判籌碼。石書銘問余有考慮合法性嗎？李運騰指余已回答不想違法，石追問余腦海中有無特定法例，惟李運騰指余並非法律專家，陳慶偉亦說「你是問她撰文時有無查詢香港的法律？現實點！」，石指她是問余的心態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余在雙方討論期間，一度答是《基本法》第27條（列明香港居民享有罷工的權利和自由），又主動說「我相信公務員都會有保障，因為《基本法》應該保障咗全香港人」，但陳慶偉指他們在跟余的代表律師說話，「我們不是在辦研討會」，李運騰亦重申辯方是問余無資格回應的法律問題。李其後改問，余當時認為公務員罷工是否合法，余說「絕對係」。石書銘欲再問為什麼，陳慶偉不准許，指余的理解或對或錯，而她將合法性放到最優先的位置。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指訪問用字比自己立場更激進無要求下架因會帶來公關災難&quot;&gt;余指訪問用字比自己立場更激進、無要求下架因會帶來「公關災難」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續引余慧明4月22日刊於《香港獨立媒體》的訪問〈【專訪】從組織工會到走進議會 余慧明：我要真攬炒！〉，指訪問引述余稱「一定要用任何方法去推翻而家呢個政權、呢個政府，先可以做到一個改變」，問余有否被引述錯誤。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余指訪問刊出前記者無給予她看，刊出後她獲發文章連結並閱讀，認為有些字眼「係比我嘅立場更加激進嘅」，而有些位置「我覺得係唔完全反映緊我當時表達嘅意思」，但她無要求修改或下架，因當時是競選階段，如這樣做會帶來「公關災難」，故選擇「冷處理」。余並指就該句話，她不肯定是否確切引述（exact quote），但肯定她有用過類似「推翻呢個制度」和要民選政府的字眼，而她認為「政權」等於政府，「推翻政權」等同「林鄭下台」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰亦問題目中「我要真攬炒」是否余的說法，余說認為該標題是記者或編輯根據她早前文章〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉而擬定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱望爭制度改革林鄭下台無意思&quot;&gt;余稱望爭制度改革、林鄭下台無意思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又指，正如她3月的〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉也強調要爭取制度上改革，指「你純粹改咗個執政者，係冇意思嘅對我嚟講，因為林鄭落台，你搵個林鄭2.0上去，係冇改變過」。李運騰問，但若那人願意對話呢？余指「咁依個可能係一個改變嚟嘅」，辯方再問如制度一樣，但在位者願意對話，余還堅持要推翻制度嗎？余回應認為她在爭取一個較民主、公平的制度，「咁當然我都會願意同佢傾咗先，睇吓佢係咩態度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/68UTBa5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第113天。余慧明繼續作供，表明其預設立場是對議案投反對票，除非政府回應五大訴求，否則會反對一切議案直至政府回應為止；但余亦指，五大訴求中最重要是雙普選，若政府能提供確實時間表她便可接受，其他訴求則可由民選政府實行。余又重申反對一切議案是其高姿態談判手法，法官問她是「扮硬淨」抑或「真硬淨」？余強調「我係會講得出、做得到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就余在《國安法》後發文稱「惡法壓境，極權肆虐……我們與政權再無斡旋餘地」，余指「惡法」是形容《國安法》，撰文望顯示決心，即使《國安法》後仍不會恐懼和讓步，因爭取五大訴求沒有違反《國安法》。法官李運騰指，無人要求余熱愛《國安法》，但「就算你唔鍾意都唔可以觸犯」，余指當時仍相信投票無觸犯《國安法》，故望鼓勵選民於初選投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指認同墨落兩點聲明遂簽署自視為抗爭派與泛民有別&quot;&gt;余指認同「墨落」兩點聲明遂簽署、自視為「抗爭派」與泛民有別&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明繼續作供，就「墨落無悔」聲明，余指6月10日晚從競選團隊 WhatsApp 群組得知流傳該聲明，她當時有看過，「最着眼」當中兩點聲明，而她認同該兩點聲明，故與團隊討論了一會後決定簽署，又指簽署「純粹想顯示我咁堅定嘅立場畀我啲選民睇」，無意呼籲其他人簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余同意她看到聲明前已有否決財案的想法，而她當時不知道其他區有否就運用否決權一點討論。陳仲衡指，若余有讀到前一段提及「在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎」，不會認為有討論過嗎？余說如當時有仔細看應會有此想法，但當時她認為該段文字僅鋪排聲明背景，她亦無參與過協調會，故該段「對我嚟講冇乜意思」。余亦認為，「認同若支持度跌出各區預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」一點，勉強來說「唔係太適用」於其選區，因衞生服務界只得一席，不過余認為簡單而言是「輸咗就唔好選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就聲明標題「抗爭派立場聲明書」，辯方問余會否自視為「抗爭派」。余指該詞當時應該很新，「但係如果我簽得依個聲明書，咁我都會認為自己係抗爭派囉」，又指另一原因是她也有「堅定意志」，「我係想令自己同普遍嘅泛民係有啲分別。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指提名表由助手填寫無細看認為35目標是爭民主派議會過半&quot;&gt;余指提名表由助手填寫無細看、認為35+目標是爭民主派議會過半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就提名表格，余指是由助手預先填好，她6月19日簽署後，助手翌日提交，「我係冇乜點樣睇過呢份表格。」陳仲衡問余是政治新手、首次參選，不會花時間閱讀提名表格嗎？余指其正職很忙，加上當時初選準備工作很忙碌，而她不視閱讀表格為準備工作一部分，認為純粹是報名表格。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指出表格兩處錯處，其中見證部分有余的簽署，她指收到審訊文件夾後細看發現應「出錯咗」，「唔應該係由我本人見證我自己填㗎嘛」，如她當時有細看無理由留意不到。李運騰笑言似乎余的助手也沒細看，余同意。另一錯處為表格政綱將「五大訴求」誤寫為「五大缺求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就提名表格條款「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」，余指當時無留意到，但如她有看到，就協調會議共識部分，無開協調會的她「會覺得唔關我事囉」，亦認為應指向地區直選的事，但「大會唔會為我哋依個界別特登設計多一張 form 出嚟㗎嘛」。余又指，理解「35+」的目標是「爭取民主派議會過半」。辯方問除過半外還有其他目標嗎？余說：「冇㗎啦喎，淨係35+咋喎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱雙普選為最重要訴求有確實時間表會接受-但非實現就停止追求其他&quot;&gt;余稱雙普選為最重要訴求、有確實時間表會接受 但非實現就停止追求其他&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就提名表格附上的政綱，余指以為一定要填寫，故着助手「求其整一張 poster」應付，該政綱她不曾印刷和派發。當中「我若當選，必定承諾行使反對權利反對一切議案，直至香港政府全面回應五大訴求，決一不可為止」一句，余指正確表達其意思但不全面，因她雖想展示決心，但仍會談判。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續重申認為五大訴求中最重要為「立即實行雙普選」，其他訴求則可在雙普選後透過可認真反映民意的民選政府實行，而「只要政府係有個實在、白紙黑字寫到明嘅時間表，我都可以解釋畀我嘅選民聽，我會接受」；而若政府「反口」，「咁我就根據我嘅承諾，行使返我嘅反對權利，直至政府再次回應我為止。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰關注「立即」一詞，指余曾說普選不能一夜實現。余回應是立即實行一個確實、確切的時間表，用「立即」是想展示決心。惟法官陳仲衡引余慧明於另一訪問提及，政權「一定要回應五大訴求缺一不可，而唔係即係可能回應其中一兩個訴求，就當係可以解決到呢個問題」，指是「缺一不可」，而非僅回應一兩個訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余同意，但「唔代表我實行咗雙普選之後我就會停止吖嘛，我要確保嗰個民選政府，都要做埋第二、第三、第四個訴求，咁咪就係『五大訴求、缺一不可』囉」。而就列出的五大訴求無提林鄭下台，余重申因林鄭下台無法解決問題，要爭取制度改革。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱永遠企喺雞蛋一方-官質疑與案無關不准辯方發問&quot;&gt;余稱「永遠企喺雞蛋一方」 官質疑與案無關不准辯方發問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘續就每項訴求發問，就「撤回送中惡法」，余同意已達到；就「撤回暴動定性」，余指認為出現該訴求是因每當有暴力事件發生，「政府只會一味就係話我哋係使用暴力，一味譴責，甚至乎抹黑緊我哋整場嘅運動」，陳仲衡問余用「我哋」一詞，是站在抗爭者一方？余答：「我永遠企喺雞蛋嘅一方」，又問：「我可唔可以繼續講？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉質疑為何要深究，石書銘指他是問及余的底線，即政府如何回應才可接受、她何時會反對政府議案，惟陳慶偉多番指看不到有何需要，李運騰亦指余已回答。余其後同意，當選後會在投票前諮詢其界別，陳仲衡即問她稱會否決所有議案，如何能就所有議案諮詢選民？余指不是就所有議案諮詢，如政府不回應五大訴求她仍會反對一切議案；但若局勢有變、政府開始回應，她難確保民意是否仍會堅決「五大訴求，缺一不可」，那時就要諮詢選民。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱預設立場為反對議案-除非找不到反對原因&quot;&gt;余稱預設立場為反對議案 除非找不到反對原因&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後關注，余慧明當選後如何決定投票意向。余指她雖於競選期間表明會反對一切議案，但「唔代表我唔睇個內容就會投反對」，她仍會研究政府政策流弊，正如疫情時一直有就政府防疫措施作出批評和建議。李運騰問若議案與五大訴求無關呢？余指其政綱已表明反對一切議案，投票支持她的選民亦認同其政綱，故會投反對；又指會研究政策流弊仔細分析予選民，「我就算投反對票我都係有理有據嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡質疑，余並非衡量議案利弊，而是找理由反對，余指「利與弊都可以睇到嘅，但係我會詳細列舉個弊多過利」。李運騰再指即余已決定反對議案，其後再找原因，余答：「我個預設嘅立場係投反對票，所以除非嗰個議案係令我搵唔到任何一個反對嘅原因」，同意可按字面解讀其政綱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱認為爭取五大訴求無違國安法-官一度稱就算你唔鍾意都唔可以觸犯&quot;&gt;余稱認為爭取五大訴求無違《國安法》 官一度稱：就算你唔鍾意都唔可以觸犯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就余慧明7月7日於發布的〈【初選意義】〉文章，余指非全由她所撰、助理處理，但她有背書（endorse）。當中提及「惡法壓境，極權肆虐」，余指「惡法」是指《國安法》，因認為條文很模糊，令人觸犯紅線；至於「極權」是指無理會人民反對聲音、支持《國安法》通過的香港政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「我們與政權再無斡旋餘地」，余重申想顯示決心，即使《國安法》立法後，「我都唔會恐懼，我都唔會作出讓步，除非政府係釋出佢嘅善意，放低佢傲慢嘅身段同我哋再商討點樣可以繼續爭取我哋嘅五大訴求，因為我認為爭取五大訴求係冇違反國安法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰關注余將《國安法》形容為惡法，說：「無人要求你熱愛《國安法》，但說可以違反《國安法》是另一回事。（“Nobody asks you to love it. Nobody requires you to love it. But it is another thing to say that one can violate it.”）」法庭傳譯一度未能翻譯，李續手持一枝筆指住余，直接以中文說：「就算你唔鍾意都唔可以觸犯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續解釋文章意思，「就係立咗《國安法》之後，我哋要參加初選嘅，都唔好恐懼；亦都鼓勵緊選民，即使有《國安法》之下，我仍然相信投票係冇觸犯到《國安法》，所以我係想鼓勵選民，喺初選嗰兩日出嚟投票。」余又指，她「絕對唔係」籲人違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑是扮硬淨抑或真硬淨-余稱投反對講得出做得到&quot;&gt;官質疑是扮「硬淨」抑或真「硬淨」 余稱投反對「講得出做得到」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余其後重申，提到「無斡旋餘地」是展示決心，但不欲公開談判手法，否則如「自揭底牌」。法官追問是否誇張手法，余指「或多或少都有」，但她「真係好想展示畀其他人睇，我係會使用一個高姿態嘅談判手法囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問，故余是扮演「硬淨（tough）」，還是真的「硬淨」？余說：「咁如果政權唔同我傾嘅話，我係會堅持否決，我會投反對議案，係依樣嘢我係會講得出做得到」，又強調「我只係認為作出退讓嘅應該係政府囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指國安法後不講國際戰線推翻&quot;&gt;余指《國安法》後不講「國際戰線」、「推翻」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後問《國安法》後余慧明的政綱有否改變，余指提名表格政綱無變，但宣傳單張和發言時有特意不再講「國際戰線」，因看過《國安法》條文後認為即使並非要求國際制裁，亦可能被視為「勾結外國勢力」，她亦無再用一些較敏感字眼如「推翻」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余認為投反對票非干犯國安法爭取五大訴求非解散立會&quot;&gt;余認為投反對票非干犯《國安法》、爭取五大訴求非解散立會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就余慧明7月8日的選舉造勢大會，辯方展示《獨媒》報導〈【立會選戰】民主派4人戰衛生服務界 余慧明：要將抗爭意志帶入議會〉，余確認黃之鋒、朱凱廸、張可森、劉頴匡、何桂藍和劉澤鋒也有到場，解釋她望邀請到越多候選人幫她站台越好，並會揀選一些「立場比較進取」和「唔係泛民」的人。余指候選人是由競選團隊邀請，她事前無就會上發言與他們討論，故他們發言與她無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問及支持「攬炒」候選人或被DQ的應對，報導指「余慧明坦言國安法沒有任何標準可供參考，全憑政府定奪，但她不想『自我審查』、『被噤聲』，不會為了當選而選擇暫時隱藏『攬炒』、『抗爭』等信念，希望『由心發聲』，不想違背一直以來的信念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余指當時應指選舉主任或會用很低門檻詮釋《國安法》，DQ與她本身有否犯法為兩回事，故她不會自我審查，重申認為投反對票只是行使議員職能，「依個都係《基本法》之下已經寫咗㗎喇，所以即使係啟動依個機制，我都唔認為係干犯緊《國安法》。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就報導提及余望「借『35+』之力否決法案，爭取重組立法會」，余指她非爭取解散立法會再重選立法會，「我一直爭取嘅都係『五大訴求，缺一不可』」，強調會就一切議案投反對票。李運騰再問即使議案與五大訴求無關？余指若議案與五大訴求不相關、政府也無意回應五大訴求，「我就會投反對，依個係我預設嘅立場，真係除非政府係做咗啲嘢令我回心轉意，而依個係我嘅談判手法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱戴耀廷為憲法專家-故相信初選及其政綱合法&quot;&gt;余稱戴耀廷為「憲法專家」 故相信初選及其政綱合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明續確認，有出席7月9日的初選記者會，當時相信初選和她的政綱都是合法，而戴會上說法亦令她相信是合法。余欲解釋時，李運騰打斷指法庭有謄本，知道戴談及初選合法性。余說：「正確，因為佢係一個憲法嘅專家」，李運騰即說：「Well，他說他是，那是他在記者會上的說法」，余指戴「好似冇自介為憲法專家」，李說：「我向你保證他有」，但沒關係，法庭有謄本。多名被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jusOsAB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年7月9日 民主派初選記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續確認，於7月14日在衞生服務界群組收到戴耀廷發訊息：「我公開訊息說35+目的，是運用基本法賦予立法會的權力包括否決財政預算案，今（令）特區政府問責，不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府，供大家參考。」余指事前其界別參選人無與組織者討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱重組警隊文件具參考價值減少編制為可行方法&quot;&gt;余稱重組警隊文件具參考價值、減少編制為可行方法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就余慧明家中被搜出的「重組／解散警隊可行嗎？」文件，余指非她撰寫，從集會得到後認為就「追究警暴，重組警隊」的訴求具參考價值故保留。余又並指當中提及減少警隊編制是可行方法，「例如我哋每一日都見到（法院）下面嘅警力分布」，李運騰指「每日都在減少（which is decreasing everyday）」，余再說：「但都係仍然有好多，所以我認為絕對有呢個空間去減少警隊編制」，李運騰笑稱法院曾發生玻璃幕牆破裂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tvaJakE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第112天。本案最後一名被告、參選衞生服務界的前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明開始作供，表示組織工會是她參與政治的開始，工會於2020年初「武漢肺炎」時發起工業行動要求封關，以保障市民性命安全及保護醫療系統免崩潰，惟醫管局拒回應訴求，工會要求與特首談判亦不果。余又指曾獲「中間人」行會成員林正財告知，擬將全面封關訴求包裝為「禁止世衞定為高危地區的人來港」向政府推銷，惟翌日出台卻僅為隔離措施。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余形容當局回應的態度「絕對影響到」她之後參選的決定，明白到如果無足夠話語權，「政權或者掌權者係唔會同我傾、唔會理我」，因政府非民選產生；加上2019年政府對市民訴求視若無睹，「一味武力打壓示威者」，故選擇參選。余又指，曾擔心衞生服務界多於一名參選人會「鎅票」令建制得利，遂問戴耀廷能否「順便」辦衞生服務界初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余慧明開始作供-指組織工會是參與政治開始&quot;&gt;余慧明開始作供 指組織工會是參與政治開始&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信昨作供完畢，今由本案最後一名被告、參選衞生服務界的前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明作供。正還柙的余慧明，身穿棕色外套、黑色長裙，在兩名女懲教陪同下步向證人台，其代表大律師石書銘一度上前與余握手，余精神不俗表示：「我OK」旁聽親友亦向余說：「加油呀！」余握拳放胸口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9aq4zZa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 余慧明（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余宣誓後，接受大律師石書銘主問。余現年36歲，已婚，於香港出生和長大，2010年畢業於香港中文大學護理學系，成為註冊護士，並受僱於醫管局，於2011年成為威爾斯親王醫院深切治療部護士，2017年成為深切治療部專科護士，但同年轉為醫療信息管理助理主任，於醫管局總部工作。余確認，2019年前從沒有參與任何政治活動。石書銘一度問余為何會轉職，法官打斷問為何要知道，石解釋這與余為何參加政治和初選有關，但陳慶偉重申看不到如何有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石改問余如何開始參與政治，余表示：「我認為係由我組織工會嘅開始，係我參與咗政治嘅開始。」余指她有參與醫管局員工陣線的籌委會，工會於2019年12月4日刊憲成立，余其後獲理事會選為主席。余並指，當時醫管局有約8萬名員工，工會成立初期有約1,000名會員，而2020年1月底宣布罷工時，會員人數曾上升到接近2萬人的高峰。石欲問余發起工會的原因，惟陳慶偉再打斷說「no」，李運騰亦不准發問，着問下一題。石書銘指那與余涉足政治有關，惟二人再搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/utoV1sa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指2020年1月武漢肺炎消息傳出-罷工為促封關保醫療系統及市民性命安全&quot;&gt;余指2020年1月「武漢肺炎」消息傳出 罷工為促封關保醫療系統及市民性命安全&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問工業行動的主要議題，余慧明解釋在2020年1月時，「我哋其實已經留意到中國武漢嗰邊，有一個武漢肺炎嘅疫情消息出現咗」，他們望用很和平的手法，如曾發公開信予政府和醫管局望正視問題，因當時病毒未流入香港。而發動工業行動最主要原因，「都係想保障返香港市民嘅性命安全，同埋保護返香港醫療系統避免崩潰嘅狀態嘅，所以我哋希望醫管局同埋政府可以回應我哋嘅訴求，及早進行封關嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余並解釋，根據會章，「即使我哋理事會決定咗一個工業行動，我哋都要召開一個特別會員大會……因為經過咗一個合法嘅程序……」，惟法官陳慶偉打斷，指認為與案無關，「我們不是就COVID展開獨立調查。」石書銘再問余有否獲會員授權，惟陳慶偉打斷着問下一題。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 2020年2月3日醫護罷工第一日，醫管局員工陣線到醫管局大樓與局方對話。（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指醫管局及政府回應態度絕對影響其參選決定曾收中間人林正財訊息&quot;&gt;余指醫管局及政府回應態度「絕對影響」其參選決定、曾收中間人林正財訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，罷工於2月3日開始，2月7日結束，期間曾與政府和醫管局磋商，「基於佢哋回應嘅態度，絕對影響到我之後參選嘅決定。」余指罷工前曾用電郵邀請時任食物及衞生局局長陳肇始與他們傾，但不獲回應；至罷工開始，醫管局最初接受與他們進行公開對話，但對話中「佢係完全冇直接回應我哋嘅訴求，只係不停咁遊花園」，故當晚宣布談判破裂，進行第二階段罷工。余當時亦認為在封關議題上，「淨係醫管局係話唔到事」，故想邀請時任特首兼抗疫督導委員會主席林鄭月娥「落嚟同我哋一齊傾」，但最終收到醫管局電郵指「特首係唔會同我哋傾」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余亦透露，於罷工第二天宣布翌日會去特首辦找特首時，曾收到她認為是代表政府的中間人透過一位「我認為係比較接近民主派嘅醫生嘅中間人」的訊息，在法官追問下指是時任行政會議成員林正財。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CVG4VDo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 時任行政會議成員 林正財（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余指林當時向她表示，會嘗試將全面封關的說法包裝成另一個意思相若的措施，向政府推銷，林當時說法是「禁止由世衞公布嘅高危地方嘅旅客進入香港」，余認為可以接受。惟第二日政策出台，卻轉為由內地來港人士要進行14天強制隔離，余認為「同我哋嘅預期係有落差」，因此於罷工第三天繼續罷工爭取訴求。余解釋時，李運騰一度着她毋須解釋，指「我們沒有興趣，我們不是審這個議題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指無法進一步爭取封關順應會員民主投票結果結束罷工&quot;&gt;余指無法進一步爭取封關、順應會員民主投票結果結束罷工&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明強調，「我一直都係想同政府同埋醫管局溝通，而唔係單方面進行一個工業行動。」罷工終於2月7日結束，余解釋最後一日要決定會否延長罷工繼續爭取訴求時，曾號召會員到醫管局總部嘗試與高層對話，並到他們辦公室門外靜坐等他們出來，但「佢哋一直將我哋拒諸門外」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/a9HfBNK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年2月7日醫護罷工最後一日，醫管局員工陣線到醫管局總部門外靜坐。（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余指「當時我哋感到極度嘅失望同埋唔甘心」，但認為「已經冇辦法爭取到進一步嘅封關」，同時亦了解有部分會員對病人擔心，「佢哋放唔低喺病房繼續作戰緊嘅同事」，故最終發起投票表決，最終7千多名會員投票，有4千多票反對、3千多票贊成，「所以我哋順應咗呢個民主投票嘅結果，結束咗罷工。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余解釋參選是因無足夠話語權政權唔會理我但立會過半可有話語權&quot;&gt;余解釋參選是因無足夠話語權政權「唔會理我」、但立會過半可有話語權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明續指，她罷工後開始考慮參選立法會，解釋參選有兩個原因，其一是「基於我喺2019年見證到政府對市民嘅訴求視若無睹，只係一味武力打壓示威者」；其二是罷工中她與政府和醫管局直接交手的經驗，「令我明白到一個道理係，如果我冇一個足夠嘅話語權呢，政權或者掌權者係唔會同我傾、唔會理我嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，余慧明認為政府只有在被迫時才會聆聽意見？余答：「我認為佢哋唔聽我哋嘅理由，係因為佢唔係一個民選嘅政府」，「我嘅睇法係，要有足夠嘅話語權，佢先會望到我哋囉。」余並在法官陳仲衡追問下解釋，「民選政府」就是雙普選下，行政長官產生方法是一人一票選出，「依個政府就會真正向市民問責囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，當時衞生服務界議員為香港護士協會的李國麟，他並非工會成員，理解為獨立人士。而余決定參選時，曾與工會同事討論參選地區直選抑或功能組別，但最後分析會員基礎，大部分為衞生服務界選民，加上對李國麟表現「唔滿意」，故於3月中時決定參選立法會衞生服務界。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cBHPPlN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 時任衞生服務界議員 李國麟（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余指當時尚未留意到有初選，也無看過戴耀廷和區諾軒的任何文章，但連登和 Telegram 群組等也有討論立會過半和「35+」，亦有很多文章分析如民主派於議會過半就可取得立法會控制權，「就有一個話語權喺度，咁依個正正就係我哋想要嘅嘢。」余當時也無與其他民主派候選人討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余話語權指35後有權力反客為主討論五大訴求&quot;&gt;余：「話語權」指35+後有權力反客為主討論「五大訴求」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明其後解釋，「話語權」是指當民主派取得35席後，「我哋係有一個權力可以 set 到一啲 agenda，咁我哋就唔係再跟住政府嘅 flow，唔係再跟住政府嘅 agenda 去做一啲審議，而係我哋反客為主，拎返五大訴求上嚟，做一個審議」，同意即民主派會與政府談判。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰關注，若取不到35+，民主派還會有話語權嗎？余指認為話語權即談判籌碼，如失去否決權，「我認為係冇咗咁大個籌碼，個話語權係少咗。」不過余指，「個話語權少咗但唔等於冇嘅」，「因為我仍然係可以擺出一個高姿態去同政府去談判，只不過同罷工嗰時一樣啦，如果我冇一個話語權，政府咪可以選擇唔理我囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指曾聯絡戴耀廷提出能否順便辦衞生服務界初選認為是搭單&quot;&gt;余指曾聯絡戴耀廷提出能否「順便」辦衞生服務界初選、認為是「搭單」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於參與初選的經過，余指2020年4月時估計時任衞生服務界議員李國麟會競逐連任，亦知道劉凱文有意參選，但該界別只有一席，如多於一位參選人就會造成「鎅票」，「鷸蚌相爭、建制得利」。余指當時於網上論壇的新聞，留意到戴耀廷在地區直選正辦初選，故「打算可唔可以借助到佢哋個平台，順便搞埋衞生服務界嘅初選」，而她無特別留意戴的其他主張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余遂從工會成員取得戴耀廷電話，向戴發訊息看有否可能在辦地區直選初選時順便辦衞生服務界初選，余不記得戴的確實回應，但大意是「睇吓有冇依個可能性啦」。余指，至6月9日記者會戴耀廷宣布辦衞生服務界初選前，她沒有再聯絡戴，「因為我覺得我哋只係搭單去搞初選啦，如果搞得成，咪去囉；如果搞唔成嘅，咁可能到時再算。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6XKeGpb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又指5月中曾接受《立場新聞》專訪，有齊4位衞生服務界潛在候選人，故她感覺該界別「應該係搞得成初選」。石書銘問，那余期間有與其他「被指為組織者（alleged organizer）」區諾軒、趙家賢和鍾錦麟溝通嗎？陳慶偉打斷指「他們不是被指為組織者，他們是組織者」，余慧明表示沒有。余亦沒有與另外3人討論初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XG6q22f.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第112天。余慧明繼續作供，就其文章〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉，余解釋是為爭取五大訴求，並理解「攬炒」是借助電影對白「if we burn, you burn with us」，當時市民「已經畀政權燒着緊」，她望以任何合法方法增加政府拒聽民意的代價，即使或利益受損、「冇咗份工」；又指「攬炒」雖帶來雙輸局面，但「始作俑者係政府」。余又強調其目標並非「攬炒」，而是爭取雙普選，提出「攬炒」和否決所有議案並非「恐嚇」，是擺出高姿態與政府談判。余強調「我哋從來都係有得傾」，關鍵是政府是否願放下身段聆聽民意，若政府拒談判便會反對預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文中提到「向醫管局及政權作出強而有力的控訴」，余直言「7.21、8.31、10.1，我哋真係唔可以好似政府咁話要向前看就 move on 囉」，並指運動中「冇一個政府官員要問責落台」、「冇一個警員要為自己嘅暴力行為負上責任」，但有很多示威者被拘控。余不認為只有市民一方要承受代價，而她願意嘗試用任何方式令政府「直視民意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指攬炒為即使利益受損仍要增加政府代價始作俑者為政府&quot;&gt;余指「攬炒」為即使利益受損仍要增加政府代價、始作俑者為政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選衞生服務界的前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明續作供，辯方展示3月31日於《香港獨立媒體》發布的〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉，余指約於3月30日於個人 Facebook 專頁發布，其後獨媒無獲其授權轉載，但文章應完整及準確。而她這麼早撰文，「純粹為正選鋪路」，但當時未知有初選，並在法官詢問下指可將文章解讀為參選宣言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問及標題的意思，余解釋她將「爭取五大訴求」比喻為一個旅途，若政府繼續堅持不回應民意，爭取五大訴求的時間「可能會好長」；至於使用「攬炒」，是因爭取五大訴求時，「我係願意嘗試用任何合法嘅方法，即使個過程之中我可能會利益受損，可能會冇咗份工，都要增加政府拒絕聆聽民意嘅代價。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，她並不是從戴耀廷借用「攬炒」一詞，解釋該字眼於2019年已曾出現，當時網上很多人已有使用，其文章亦與3月25日公民黨記者會和3月26日戴耀廷召開的35+記者會無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指攬炒借助if-we-burn-you-burn-with-us-指望在法律框架下令政府回應民意&quot;&gt;余指「攬炒」借助「if we burn, you burn with us」 指望在法律框架下令政府回應民意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余並解釋她理解2019年社會運動中「攬炒」的意思，「係借助咗一個電影嘅對白：“If we burn, you burn with us.”。」李運騰問是《飢餓遊戲》的對白？余同意，指認為當時的市民「係已經畀政權燒着緊」，「因為佢完全唔理市民嘅意見、唔聆聽市民嘅聲音，強行推動《逃犯條例》嘅修訂，令到事件演變成越嚟越多嘅衝突。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，她理解「you burn with us」，是示威者或市民角度「要令到政權都付出代價」，如發動大三罷令政府「面對一個好重大嘅政治壓力」，而該行動也是《基本法》保障下的權利和自由。余強調，她希望以「非暴力」的方法，在法律容許的框架下做一些抗爭，令政府聆聽民意、回應訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，余是談及雙輸局面？余說：「其實呢個唔係我想要，我想要嘅係一個 win-win」，陳慶偉笑出聲。李運騰指即使余不想，但「攬炒」基本上就是談及一個雙輸局面。余表示明白，但強調「依個局面點解會產生，係因為政府唔聆聽民意囉」，李追問但結果會是雙輸？余說：「係，但係個始作俑者係政府。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余並指，罷工時曾形容「政府攬炒緊我哋香港市民大眾」，到特首辦示威時亦曾高舉「停止攬炒」的標語，望政府封關保障市民利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指議會內攬炒非目標-目標為爭雙普選&quot;&gt;余指議會內「攬炒」非目標 目標為爭雙普選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文章的主要訊息，余指是「議會內嘅抗爭，我哋可以做到啲咩……而議會外又有啲咩抗爭嘅手法」，並指出文中一段：「『攬炒』議會，爭取35席後為手段，然後全面否決所有政府提出的議案為目的，藉此觸發基本法第五十條，令特首宣佈解散立法會，制造憲政危機，此為制度內的『攬炒』。與此同時，制度外的『攬炒』就要透過組織『大三罷』，達成罷工、罷市、罷課，令社會停擺，務求煞停一切暴政，達致制度性的改革，再共同建構重光後的香港。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余解釋，議會內「攬炒」是要令政府付出代價，「佢唔可以任意通過佢想過嘅議案」；但同時市民和議員都要付出代價，可能失去「派糖」議案如消費券。惟余強調，「議會內嘅『攬炒』，唔係我想要嘅目標」，「我嘅最終目標係爭取到雙普選」，政府之後就可推行為民造福的政策，而非「惡法」和「大白象工程」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又預期在否決預算案前，「政府已經會同我哋傾」，因當立法會選舉結果一公布，「政府其實已經會睇到民主派係攞到幾多席，就等於我哋攞到幾多話語權」，談判亦會開始。李運騰問，即最好是民主派不用否決財案？余同意，重申罷工時曾講過無數次，「如果政府肯封關嘅話，醫護人員係唔會罷工。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指採取高姿態談判手法非恐嚇-指我哋從來都係有得傾&quot;&gt;余指採取高姿態談判手法非恐嚇 指「我哋從來都係有得傾」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡關注，余慧明提到爭取35席為「手段」，全面否決所有政府議案為「目的」，余承認「呢度係寫得唔好」，因其最終目的「唔係想要否決所有議案」，而是望煞停暴政，達致制度性改革。而她認為「暴政」是拒絕聆聽人民聲音、粗暴打壓人民、面對反對聲音時「解決方法係解決提出問題嘅人」、並推行違背港人意願的政策。石書銘問，她是形容施政態度抑或一個特定政府？余指是施政態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余文中亦指泛民主張的「又傾又砌」應畫上句號，她解釋過往泛民主派與政府談判時「意志唔夠堅定、好易作出退讓」，亦「好易比人睇穿佢嘅底牌」，舉例李國麟於2015年政府「綑綁式銷售」購買水炮車的財政預算案上曾投贊成，但余認為新一屆立法會應要由一些「意志比較堅定」的議員入立法會爭取五大訴求，令政府向市民問責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Q9pjjdd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即余慧明認為就五大訴求不能退讓？余否認，指「我係採取一個高姿態嘅談判手法」。李運騰追問，即余會以「攬炒」的恐嚇（threat）迫使政府回應五大訴求？余說「呢個只係一個姿態，唔係一個恐嚇」，強調「我哋從來都係有得傾嘅，只不過係政府擺出一個高姿態。」李運騰問，那余的做法與「又傾又砌」有何分別？余指「我認為我嘅意志係會比佢哋更加堅定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問余會否讓步，余解釋：「我哋一直高舉住我哋要爭取五大訴求，但我認為最重要嘅係爭取到雙普選，因為只要爭取到雙普選之後，我認為其他嘅訴求都可以解決」，同意雙普選是她的底線。余續指，但何謂實行真普選，「依度係有得傾嘅，因為我知道雙普選唔會話叮一聲，第二日就變到出嚟畀我，但起碼我要政府畀到一個好實在嘅時間表畀我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余自言先砌後傾若政府拒絕談判會對預算案投反對票&quot;&gt;余自言「先砌後傾」、若政府拒絕談判會對預算案投反對票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續確認，文章無明確表示她會與政府談判，因想向選民展示她會採取高姿態的行為作談判手段，「我會形容自己係先砌後傾」。陳仲衡指余沒有寫出來，余說「因為我怕咁樣寫出嚟呢，就會令到人哋覺得我同啲泛民冇分別囉」，陳志全、林卓廷和法官陳慶偉等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，但事實上余與泛民無分別？余說「我認為我自己會比佢哋企得更硬㗎」，指因泛民可因一些民生議題妥協，但她主要想向選民解釋「如果我哋制度上一日唔改變嘅話，我哋都搵唔到一個解決嘅方法」，並指「政治實際上操作，你係冇辦法避免傾呢樣嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉質疑她是欺騙公眾、玩文字遊戲，余說：「唔係呀，因為我真係會投反對票囉，係有啲泛民連反對票都唔敢投。」陳仲衡問余是談及預算案？余說：「係呀」，同意其底線就是雙普選。陳慶偉續問「先砌後傾」，即余會不論內容，先否決預算案？余不同意，指因對她而言「『砌』係擺出一個好高嘅姿態，事先宣揚我會反對一切議案」。陳慶偉指即她不會這樣做，余說「咁要視乎政府係採取咩態度回應囉」。陳問，若政府拒絕與他們談判，余會對預算案投反對票？余答：「係呀，會呀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指憲政危機主導權從來在政府手無留意是戴耀廷主意&quot;&gt;余指「憲政危機」主導權從來在政府手、無留意是戴耀廷主意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余另解釋，「憲政危機」是當民主派取得35席，政府仍拒回應民意，就會產生行政和立法機關的分歧局面，政府必須面對很大政治壓力，並要透過兩次否決預算案令特首解散立法會及下台的《基本法》機制解決。李運騰指那並非余自己想出來，她由其他地方讀到？余同意，重申是論壇和 Telegram 的討論，她自己也有看過《基本法》相關條文，但無留意是戴耀廷主意，並強調觸發憲政危機的主導權「從來都喺政府手入面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指三罷是政府不回應訴求結果如政府願聽民意願停三罷與政府傾&quot;&gt;余指三罷是政府不回應訴求結果、如政府願聽民意願停三罷與政府傾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文中提及：「我與同伴萌生組織工會的念頭，希望團結有共同理念的同業，凝聚力量發動全民三罷，令社會停擺，向醫管局及政權作出強而有力的控訴。」余解釋，「令社會停擺」是她想像全民三罷會發生的事，如巴士地鐵停駛、經濟活動停止。李運騰指余還談及罷課，基本上是日常生活停擺。余同意，但強調「呢樣嘢其實唔係我哋想見到，不過政府唔回應訴求嘅時候，呢個係最壞嘅結果囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余重申，文章主軸是要爭取五大訴求，「我會嘗試係用法律容嘅框架之下，作出我嘅抗爭。咁當然啦，如果政府係隨時聆聽民意嘅話，我哋係願意停止做呢啲三罷，而係同政府傾囉。但重點就係要政府放低佢嘅身段，放低佢傲慢嘅態度，嚟同我哋展開對話囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余控訴反修例無警員為警暴負責無官員問責下台-指林鄭應下台&quot;&gt;余控訴反修例無警員為警暴負責、無官員問責下台 指林鄭應下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「向醫管局及政權作出強而有力的控訴」，就向政權的控訴，余指2019年示威者上街示威，「換嚟嘅係政府越嚟越高壓嘅手段去鎮壓，然後同市民講，我哋要回復正常。」惟余指，「我認為依樣嘢唔可以得過且過，即係發生過嘅事，7.21、8.31、10.1，我哋真係唔可以好似政府咁話要向前看就 move on 囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續說：「喺依場運動當中，冇一個政府官員要問責落台，亦冇一個警員要為自己嘅暴力行為負上責任，但同時間，已經有好多示威者被拘捕、被檢控，我認為依個係冇辦法接受嘅，我唔認為點解淨係市民一方要承受個代價」，因此她提「控訴」，是「我係願意嘗試用任何嘅方式，令到呢個政府係要直視民意囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於對醫管局的控訴，余指2019年，「佢要求我哋員工要政治中立，但係發生理大事件嘅時候，啲催淚彈水炮車喺QEH（伊利沙伯醫院）外面橫飛嘅時候，佢冇理過嗰度返工放工嘅員工嘅安全，佢亦都冇理過喺病房硬食TG嘅病人，只係擺幾部空氣清新機就算，佢從來冇對警暴作出任何譴責，我認為醫管局係企咗喺政權嘅一邊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;到了2020年，「我認為佢對於罷工嘅處理手法非常之差劣，隨後疫情嘅處理亦都反應好緩慢，佢係置公眾利益於不顧，所以我認為，人工比特首仲要高嘅醫管局行政總裁，應該喺疫情之後落台問責。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，那特首呢？她也應下台嗎？余說「依個我係認為係嘅」，重申「我爭取嘅雙普選，係要選出一個民選嘅政府」，因林鄭當時並非民選政權。石書銘一度問，余曾提到7.21、8.31、10.1，認為法庭應知悉，惟陳慶偉打斷表示不關心，陳仲衡亦指只會留意相關的證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RgBrAga.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第112天。余慧明表示，認為在政府漠視民意、與市民僵持不下的情況下，制度上的變革，即透過一人一票選出立法會和特首的「真普選」，可反映民意並解決困局，並強調雙普選從來都是《基本法》承諾。法官陳慶偉聞言以英國脫歐為例，指支持和反對者相差甚微，難言政府是反映所有人民意；又指民主制度不一定要普選，有國家並非實行普選也不會被視為較不民主，舉例英國首相並非由普選產生，上議院亦毫不民主，何桂藍聞言大笑。余慧明回應，起碼外國可辦公投彰顯民意，「我哋連公投都冇」；又指英國議會也有很多議員是民選，惟香港在「完善選舉制度」下的議會，直選議席更少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱破局為以雙普選突破政府市民僵局強調為基本法承諾&quot;&gt;余稱「破局」為以雙普選突破政府市民僵局、強調為《基本法》承諾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選衞生服務界的前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明續作供，就2020年3月於《獨媒》刊出的〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉一文，提及「要破局，必須由制度上的變革開始，甚至把制度推倒重來也在所不惜。今年立法會選舉可能是破舊立新的好時機」，被問「破局」意思，余解釋當時政府和市民爭持不下，政府漠視民意、以暴力鎮壓人民，市民就用暴力回應武力鎮壓，余不想見到此僵持局面，故望尋求突破，並認為制度上的變革，即她一直很想追求的「真普選」，「係可以解決依個困局。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指將「制度推倒重來」，是因現時制度不夠好，政府和立法會未能完全反映民意，故望以雙普選的新制度取代舊制度，即一人一票選出特首和立法會議員。惟余強調，「呢個新嘅制度，從來都係《基本法》承諾，而唔係我自己突然間變出嚟想要嘅」，形容是在《基本法》合法制度內爭取「一個制度嘅重置」，「唔係一個武力、亦都唔係一個制度之外嘅 mechanism。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡關注，若余只是望在制度框架內改革，為何提及在所不惜把制度推倒重來。余強調，其意思並非將香港整個制度、即三權分立的局面推倒重來，只是希望特首和立法會議席均透過普選產生，特首仍須中央任命、向中央負責，但同時「都要向下面嘅市民負責任」。余亦指，推倒重來與香港是中國的一部分、及中央政府權力架構無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱真普選可反映民意-官指英首相亦非普選產生&quot;&gt;余稱真普選可反映民意 官指英首相亦非普選產生&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就「比起追求假希望，不如尋求真『攬炒』，或許才會為香港帶來一線生機」，余解釋假希望是即使市民「乜都唔做」，政府也會突然作出妥協、「突然回應晒五大訴求」，但她認為這機會是零；而尋求真「攬炒」就是在議會內外的攬炒，望令政府受壓，面對「堅持己見」或「順應民意」的局面。李運騰問即「攬炒」是可能？余指認為要到政府拒絕聆聽民意，「好極端嘅狀態」下才會發生。李追問基於余的描述，政府當時還不夠極端嗎？余說：「如果係夠極端嘅話，應該真係出現咗大三罷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉說還有一個可能，就是不是所有人都同意余的立場。余表示明白，因此認為追求真普選是解決公平性問題的方法，因支持追求民主和五大訴求的人，應可揀選較貼近民主派的特首；但若局勢轉變便可能揀選建制派特首，「正正就係反映緊民意」。陳慶偉問，所以余是追求更民主的制度？余說「當然」。陳慶偉指那不一定是普選，指「更民主」可以指除普選外的任何東西，余回應「但係我暫時淨係認為普選先至可以解決到嗰個局勢嘅問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳說香港的情況是這樣，因《基本法》寫明普選，但也有國家沒有實行普選，但不會視為較不民主。余回應視乎政府施政態度，「如果佢係可以真正反映民意嘅……」，不過陳慶偉打斷說那很困難，指就英國脫歐公投，支持和反對兩者相差不足1%，無論如何也不能說政府反映所有市民的民意，指是互相讓步（give and take）和制度的問題。余說：「但起碼外國有個公投可以令到民意得以彰顯，我哋連公投都冇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指只是以此為例子，他不記得英國曾辦過多少次公投，又說「例如在英國，首相並非由普選產生」，被告欄的何桂藍聞言即大笑出聲，再以手掩口。陳續指，英國國會分為上議院和下議院，但上議院毫不民主（by no means democratic）；但亦指他同意余，在香港的情況，《基本法》列明最終會有普選。余表示明白，但指「人哋個議會都有好多議員係民選出嚟啦」。陳慶偉指下議院當然全部民選，但上議院不然，余再說：「我哋完善選舉制度之後嘅議會，直選議席係更加少。」辯方續就其他問題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，2016年的英國脫歐公投，支持脫歐為51.89%，支持留下為48.11%，兩者相差3.78%。而英國採用直接選舉制，由議員選出約650個下議院議員，如一個黨擁有絕對多數議員，該黨將組成下屆政府，該黨黨魁會成為首相。至於英國上議院有約780名議員，他們非經選舉產生，包括神職人員和貴族，但權力較下議院小。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余稱2019年後功能組別不可只着眼業界利益應將港人利益擺先&quot;&gt;余稱2019年後功能組別不可只着眼業界利益、應將港人利益擺先&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，余表示文中一個很重要的訊息，就是鼓勵擁有功能組別資格的選民，由超區轉回功能組別，解釋因4月2日是申請的限期。陳仲衡關注文中哪處提及，余引述她提到：「所有立法會議會席位包括功能組別都不再屬於某界別利益，而應向全港市民問責」，又指「如果要爭取個話語權，梗係攞到越多席位越好啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，該句看來是着選民不應只看業界利益。余同意，指在立法會普選下，所有議席均應由直選產生。李追問，似乎余是指她投票時或會違背業界利益，因認為那代表更大更廣的公眾利益？余同意，指「經歷過2019年社會事件之後，我認為即使係功能組別都唔可以淨係着眼於自己嘅業界利益」，功能組別「應該要將香港人嘅利益擺先」，而其後訪問也有提到若業界利益與公眾有矛盾時會如何投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余指光復香港是真正實行港人治港&quot;&gt;余指「光復香港」是真正實行港人治港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就文中提到：「這是一個考驗耐性與決心的時代，要進行這場時代革命，就看大家對光復香港有多大耐性與決心。」余表示由2019年開始，「我哋一直爭取制度上嘅改革，係一場革命」，故稱呼該場運動為「時代革命」。至於「光復香港」，余形容是「令到以香港人優先、真正實行港人治港高度自治方針嘅香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainians often left their homes with only the clothes on their backs and a small bag — an all-too-common experience in a world experiencing record high levels of forced displacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, unlike many other displaced populations, almost all Ukrainians were able to bring their smartphones, a near-unmatched level of tech savviness, and supportive, tightly woven online networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This connectivity has presented new opportunities to assist vulnerable people; it has also put those same vulnerable people face-to-face with new online threats that can translate into very real physical danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukraines-digital-connectivity&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s Digital Connectivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HPh8yEO.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digitization has always been central to President Zelensky’s vision of Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promises surrounding digitization served a critical role in his almost entirely virtual campaign. At the time, it was seen as a way to both fight corruption and engage the country’s younger generation. However, the long-term impacts of his administration’s efforts in this area can be seen both in the success of the war effort and in the options now open to displaced Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just months after Zelensky’s election in 2019, the Ukrainian government established the Ministry of Digital Transformation — a trailblazing effort to transform government through the creation of the “state in a smartphone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the goal of making 100 percent of government services available online by 2024, the Ministry of Digital Transformation quickly mobilized to launch Diia — meaning “action” — a mobile app and web platform centralizing citizen access to public services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Ukraine became the first country in the world to issue digital passports through Diia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After February 2022, the Ukrainian government worked to ensure that Ukraine’s digital connections were both protected and strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IbsCOiN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky’s administration has partnered with Starlink, the European Union, and European telecom companies to ensure that Ukrainians maintain internet connection during the war. This has been essential to countering Russian attempts to control information flows about the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining internet access is also critical to ensure that displaced Ukrainians — both within Ukraine and across international borders — are able to access to public services, personal networks, and aid resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ukraine’s level of digital connectedness has spurred new opportunities and innovations to aid displaced Ukrainians across several critical areas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ukraines-diia-app&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s Diia App&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed with the motto, “the government in a smartphone,” Diia has brought essential public resources to the fingertips of Ukrainians both within and outside of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launched in 2020, Diia was downloaded on the phones of one-third of the adult Ukrainian population by 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diia has been at the center of the digital effort to aid Ukrainians. As of May 2023, 70 percent of Ukrainian-owned smartphones have Diia installed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through Diia, Ukrainians can register as displaced and have access to digital forms of the identification document that they need to cross borders. They can also provide digital signatures on official documents using biometrics, pay taxes and fines, collect cash payments, receive compensation for damaged property, donate to the war effort, register a child or a business, report information about Russian troops, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;internet-and-connectivity&quot;&gt;Internet and Connectivity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stable and secure internet connections have been critical to keeping Ukrainians connected with resources, aid, and their digital networks during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starlink, a satellite constellation that provides internet coverage to countries across the world, has been critical to ensure that Ukrainians — as well as Ukrainian hospitals, energy sources, educational institutions, and businesses — have access to fast and stable internet. Starlink was also responsible for restoring internet connection in cities such as Irpin, Bucha, Borodyanka, and Chernihiv.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nokia, in partnership with the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation, started a project to modernize internet networks across Ukraine, ensuring that Ukrainians and Ukrainian institutions retained internet access in the face of physical bombardment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Commission and the European Parliament coordinated with European telecom providers to reduce costs or freely provide roaming and international calling within the European Union and Ukraine for displaced Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;services-and-assistance&quot;&gt;Services and Assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many Ukrainians having to quickly flee their homes, a number of different platforms have been created to connect displaced Ukrainians to key information, assistance, and aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Alarm app by Ajax Systems serves as a digital air raid siren that helps provide safety warnings to all Ukrainians with smart phones even if municipal air raid sirens are destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UN Refugee Agency’s (UNHCR) online dashboards outline key information about each refugee-receiving country, so that Ukrainian refugees have information on how to access public services and aid and how to report fraud and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Host governments have similarly created online platforms for Ukrainian refugees seeking assistance, including the “Dopomoha,” platform launched by the Romanian and Moldovan governments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UNHCR’s system also allows Ukrainians to register with their biometric data to collect cash aid payments at ATMs across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;housing&quot;&gt;Housing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of online platforms have been created to match Ukrainian refugees with short- and long-term housing opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Online projects have been started by many companies and organizations to match Ukrainian refugees with short- and long-term housing opportunities, including  betterplace.org, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Station F (France), Wunderflats (Germany), EU4UA, Prykhystok, Ukraine Now, HomesforUkraine.eu (Austria), Casafari, Shelter UKR, TakecareBnB, Icanhelp.host, and UkraineTakeShelter.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to help aid organizations prioritize where to work, some projects are collecting comprehensive data on displacement patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The International Organization for Migration (IOM) Displacement Tracking Matrix has tracked internal displacement data in order to create a more accurate picture of the state of internal displacement in Ukraine to aid the IOM’s and other aid organizations’ efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;supplies-and-resources&quot;&gt;Supplies and Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many organizations are focused on distributing essential supplies such as food, water, shelter materials, and power banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Projects such as the Ukrainian Defense Fund and Gorillas have created apps to collect and distribute supplies on the ground to people within Ukraine and in areas with high numbers of Ukrainian refugees, such as across the Polish border.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other projects, such as Lifesaver and Techfugees, have focused on providing more specific supplies — power banks — ensuring that Ukrainians can maintain mobile access even when power is out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transportation&quot;&gt;Transportation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of different platforms have been created to help displaced Ukrainians travel safely to their desired destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Techfugees, in partnership with Citizens of Our Planet and Chili Piper, has created a detailed virtual guide for Ukrainians on transportation options for traveling within Ukraine or to cross international borders into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Companies such as Uber and Flixbus have offered free trips for refugees — especially around the Ukraine-Poland border.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ride-sharing apps such as Uklon  and BlaBlaCar have worked to organize carpools for Ukrainians fleeing the war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;employment&quot;&gt;Employment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many Ukrainians out of work due to the war, online platforms have been created to help connect displaced Ukrainians with job opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those looking to work in tech, Employ Ukraine seeks to match Ukrainians with tech positions in EU companies and allows the companies to pay them directly through the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google created a $5 million fund to provide cash awards and Google support to Ukrainian start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;education-and-culture&quot;&gt;Education and Culture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to maintain a sense of normalcy, some organizations are utilizing online tools to connect displaced Ukrainians with educational and cultural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Laptops for Ukraine” is an EU initiative to collect and distribute laptops and smartphones for schools as well as other public institutions to ensure that public service provision can continue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Levebee was funded by the European Union to serve as an app to support the continued education of Ukrainian children during the war. Children can learn math, languages, and other subjects remotely on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In light of the destruction of parts of Ukraine during the war, the European Competence Centre for Cultural Heritage (4CH) created the Supporting Ukrainian Monuments Initiative, which digitizes and preserves Ukrainian culture online.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;missed-connections&quot;&gt;Missed Connections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cKIVAq3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As comprehensive as the digital platforms helping displaced Ukrainians are, certain demographics are at risk of being left behind as they try to access vital resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of organizations have found that elderly people have struggled to adjust to the mass proliferation of digital tools. A UNDP report found a significant digital divide across different age groups in Ukraine, with over 46 percent of older Ukrainians reporting in early 2022 that they never use the internet. Another study found that 53 percent of Ukrainians have a “below average” level of digital skills — an issue that has become a central focus for the Diia.Education team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, people with irregular status are unable to register for Diia, as the user’s information must be registered with the Ukrainian immigration system to gain access to the app. Moreover, users need a Ukrainian bank account and a taxpayer number in order to go through the identification process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequentially, as discussed in a recent CSIS piece, stateless persons in Ukraine are also unable to use the app because they lack any proof of nationality, birth certificates, passports, or residence permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, according to an interview with a civil society organization conducting programming in Ukraine, Ukrainian citizens who reside in Russian-occupied territories such as the Donetsk and Luhansk regions cannot safely use Diia. Using Diia could put them at risk while under Russian occupation, as doing so would mean that they admit to retaining Ukrainian citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gap in availability of services and centralized information puts people already vulnerable to exploitation at additional risk of being left out of assistance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities-for-exploitation&quot;&gt;Opportunities for Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/razAFfz.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Ukrainians navigate their journey away from the conflict, the same access to digital information that facilitated their escape can also leave them vulnerable to dangers just as real as those they left back home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;i-trafficking&quot;&gt;I. Trafficking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actors with malicious intentions have also capitalized on this proliferation of new digital platforms designed to help Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even prior to Russia’s invasion, Ukraine faced high levels of human trafficking, as both an origin and destination country for victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the UN migration agency, over 300,000 Ukrainians have been victims of human trafficking since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men, women, and children are all at risk of trafficking, including forced labor, forced sex work, and forced begging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Via kidnapping or coercive recruitment, victims are frequently trafficked to various locations around Europe and Eurasia, such as Russia, Poland, Iraq, Spain, and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as displaced Ukrainians are using digital tech to help them navigate complex journeys, traffickers are becoming more adept at using these resources to identify, mislead, and capture people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2022 a Europol-sponsored hackathon identified at least 30 online platforms created to exploit Ukrainian refugees, 10 of which explicitly targeted them for trafficking. In May 2022 an EMPACT action day monitored 125 online platforms, leading to the identification of nine suspected human traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a PBS report showed evidence of online listings for rent-free housing in exchange for sex work and housework, as well as scam online advertising for intermediaries who claim to help with immigration paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, the moderators for Facebook groups established to match Ukrainian refugees with resources — including housing arrangements — have witnessed potential traffickers attempting to contact vulnerable people, particularly women traveling alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, the proliferation of online aid networks has opened a new portal for traffickers to target, locate, and capture displaced Ukrainians in search of assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ii-misuse-of-information&quot;&gt;II. Misuse of Information&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A generalized lack of trust in available information, combined with complex, confusing, or missing language on official government websites has driven people to overly rely on peer-to-peer information seeking through informal channels. Many of these platforms, such as Facebook, Telegram, and WhatsApp are particularly susceptible to mis- and disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malign actors — including the Russian state — use these networks to spread false information. During the March 2022 invasion, a variety of popular Telegram channels spread false information claiming that Russia had taken critical Ukrainian cities. Soon after the March 2022 invasion, Russian actors used social media platforms to attempt to discredit reports about their attack on a Mariupol hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, many small organizations and startups created their own online platforms in the wake of the invasion but failed to keep them updated. While likely unintentional, the proliferation of online information sources resulted in “digital litter” — an abundance of broken links and websites with outdated or false information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People trying to plan how to flee Ukraine, find resources, or locate employment opportunities must sort through outdated, unclear, or even false information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iii-cybercrime&quot;&gt;III. Cybercrime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad actors see opportunity in vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberspace is filled with scammers, hackers, and websites that seek to take advantage of people in search of jobs, legal assistance, or humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, nine people were arrested for operating over 400 phishing sites claiming to offer financial benefits to Ukrainians. They are estimated to have stolen over $3,360,000 from approximately 5,000 victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People receiving displaced people in their homes have also become targets online. Fraud schemes, including fake financial assistance for hosts, fake donation websites, and illegitimate fundraising campaigns have led people in host countries to send money directly to scammers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, some host countries are worried that malign actors are using unknowing hosts to gather sensitive data about refugees from Ukraine. For example, government officials in Poland, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom have warned of fake letters circulating on social media asking hosts of Ukrainian refugees to share personal information about their guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iv-toxic-online-narratives-and-hate-speech&quot;&gt;IV. Toxic Online Narratives and Hate Speech&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the invasion, there has been an uptick in hate speech acts propagated via social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2023 there were reports of anti-Ukrainian narratives circulating through Polish Twitter, with some tweets using xenophobic hashtags. A study by the Centre for Information Resilience concluded that compared to previous years, 2022 saw an increase in the use of nationalistic slurs against Ukrainians on Twitter and Telegram, including from verified blue-check accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telegram channels dehumanizing the plight of Ukrainians and distributing hateful and disturbing media — sometimes depicting corpses or attacks alongside hateful narrations and captions — were identified as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These practices can be both a root cause of forced displacement and a protection threat to the displaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, these narratives can cause potential host communities to reject migrants; in others, they might lead refugees to be more reticent to accept aid from legitimate sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogue actors have successfully exploited online platforms to promote trafficking and cybercrimes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, the use of mis- and disinformation and the proliferation of toxic online narratives and hate speech can be prevented.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-protection&quot;&gt;Digital Protection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QpL89Gn.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even as the war wages on, actors making use of digital tools can work to support the safety and integrity of information and services provided to displaced Ukrainians.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;i-fight-cybercrime&quot;&gt;I. Fight Cybercrime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aid actors implementing digital programming should work to train refugees and volunteers on how to spot and combat suspicious activity online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, UNHCR, according to interviews, is conducting training on digital issues with its staff in Ukraine. IOM Ukraine has similarly taken an innovative approach to training displaced Ukrainians on how to spot online threats. IOM developed two online games (one targeted at children and one at adults) where users engage in a “quest,” making a series of difficult decisions mirroring the experiences and threats faced by displaced Ukrainians during the war. At the end of the game, the pros and cons of each decision are explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to helping users learn to make smarter decisions about whom to trust when on the move, IOM’s platform has also been used to offer current information — including a road map — on best practices for displaced persons. However, while the game itself is digital, it does not address the threats that Ukrainian refugees are likely to encounter in the digital landscape. This gap has at least partially been filled by the Diia.Education team, which developed online guides and simulators walking Ukrainians through combating human trafficking, promoting online safety for children and elderly populations, and implementing best practices for cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ii-improve-vetting-for-digital-programming&quot;&gt;II. Improve Vetting for Digital Programming&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations must implement stringent vetting procedures for aid and programming that is organized or advertised online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNHCR has already started upping vetting procedures for volunteers and discouraging beneficiaries from accepting help from unregistered volunteers. Similarly, Airbnb.org — the company’s nonprofit arm — implemented a vetting procedure to review hosts before they were matched with displaced Ukrainians. Still, the vetting procedures of various organizations, including Airbnb, have been criticized as falling short of what is necessary to truly protect the displaced, in part because they did not include substantive background checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing a comprehensive vetting process is often laborious for an aid organization and can slow down aid dispersal. However, it is critical to ensure that aid programs do not place the displaced directly in harm’s way. Similarly, although efforts to individually vet volunteers and share locations are smart practice, the onus should not be on vulnerable displaced persons themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iii-reduce-digital-litter&quot;&gt;III. Reduce Digital Litter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital litter leads displaced persons to rely on misleading or unavailable information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both governments and other actors should work to clear the web of outdated portals and simplify language online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several organizations and researchers are now aware that the abundance of unusable links and outdated information online represents an important downside to using the digital space to distribute information. There are many in the tech space who are willing to volunteer to clear digital litter if the right campaigns are run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, social media influencers and actors should be urged to carefully date and archive any information they publish and, should efforts cease, be responsible for clearing their digital footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since many of these independent platforms are born out of a need for clearer information and conciseness, governments should work toward simplifying their website language, date and update content, display information in different languages and dialects, establish Q&amp;amp;A sections in their portals, and enable chatbots or a channel for feedback and questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iv-work-with-ukrainian-civil-society-to-create-trust&quot;&gt;IV. Work with Ukrainian Civil Society to Create Trust&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If digital programming is going to be effective, displaced Ukrainians must be able to trust the information they find online. Actors should look to campaigns created in other contexts to create a campaign promoting trust in credible online information. Notably, lessons could be taken from the “Confía en el Jaguar” campaign — launched by UNHCR and Facebook in Mexico in 2016 — which used the symbol of the jaguar to mark trustworthy migration information available through social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along similar lines, IOM created a Telegram hotline for Ukrainians looking to quickly verify online information. By scanning a QR code, users are taken to a Telegram chat room, linked with a hotline where users can engage with a real person in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNHCR has similarly launched a pilot of its messaging service (first piloted in Ecuador in 2020), offering frequently updated automated responses to aid queries. The platform also functions to connect refugees with specialized staff to help them answer questions that cannot be answered by the messaging service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By working proactively to fight cybercrime, improve vetting procedures, reduce digital litter, and create trust in online information, state and non-state actors alike have the opportunity to develop a virtual world where displaced Ukrainians can thrive, despite the realities of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukraines-digital-future&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s Digital Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ahDpG6d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much of the world has rallied to support Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital innovations like Diia have rightly been celebrated as a means to keep Ukrainian refugees connected, despite the devastation caused by the ongoing Russian war of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, a proliferation of digital resources and aid has translated to a growth of new, unmoderated platforms. While many of these initiatives were created with good intentions, many also lack the controls to prevent exploitation. Global actors should take care to avoid creating opportunities for malicious actors to exploit digitally connected — yet still vulnerable — displaced Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Ukrainian refugees are getting smart about their interactions online and implementing their own vetting procedures. But they shouldn’t have to do this work alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals and aid organizations seeking to use digital tools to help Ukrainians have a responsibility to engage in digital protection and to consider all of the uses — and misuses — of the platforms and resources they create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine pushes forward toward the end of the war, the decisions made today about the country’s digital space have the opportunity to shape its reconstruction process. Building a safer digital space now means that Ukraine will be all the more ready to embrace a truly digital future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of cyber war hyperbole, unhelpful headlines such as Newsweek’s “The Rising Risk of a Cyber Pearl Harbour” in 2021 usually grab the everyday reader’s attention but limit our understanding of the far more important dimension of these cyber incidents: how states and non-state actors use cyberspace below the threshold of war to further their strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when scrolling down The New York Times’s tag on “cyberwarfare”, most of the reporting concentrates on espionage and activities such as information operations and subversion – which in practice, is a more accurate reflection of what goes on in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the jury is still out on alternative concepts to “cyber war” that can appropriately capture the effects of cyber operations below the threshold of armed conflict and how they might transform intelligence activities. The book Deter, Disrupt or Deceive: Assessing Cyber Conflict as an Intelligence Contest offers some options – although it does not seek to be conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To what extent is it worth considering that states are actually involved in a continuous “intelligence contest” in cyberspace?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-a-trap-reassessing-the-vocabulary&quot;&gt;It’s a Trap! Reassessing the Vocabulary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the ongoing war in Ukraine has illustrated, the obsession with the concept of “cyber war” is not just about the latest news headlines; rather, it has resulted in deep miscalculations about the role of cyber operations in conflict and crisis scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first miscalculation from the hyperbole around “cyber war” is the heightened expectations of what cyber operations can and should deliver. Having been known for numerous disruptive cyber incidents, Russia’s cyber operations at the outbreak of the war in Ukraine were commonly depicted as contrary to expectations. There was no widespread or particularly significant impact from Russian destructive cyber operations, no cyber takedown of Ukrainian critical national infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exemplifies how “cyber war” can also fail to grasp how effects are shaped by a culture of strategic doctrine – as is particularly the case with Russia’s conceptualisation of cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the focus on decisive and short-term effects of cyber operations, especially in conflict situations, has also led to a paradoxical dismissal of the cumulative effects that operations have as part of a wider contest between state and non-state actors. Russian cyber activity during the war has still revealed a largely unprecedented deployment of capabilities, with at least nine new wiper malware families, two ransomware attacks and the targeting of 100 organisations in Ukraine. According to companies such as ESET, Microsoft, Mandiant and other large threat intelligence companies, Russia has used a record amount of data-destroying malware on Ukraine, showcasing an accelerated pace of deployment of cyber capabilities in conflict scenarios. This in turn has also contributed to the reuse of many of these capabilities in at least other 25 countries, which showcases the cascading effects of sub-threshold capabilities. Despite these numbers – and within this particular context – cyber operations have not been the decisive or primary tool in the conflict. They have, however, contributed to the broader friction of war – be it in the operation of infrastructure, communication or leveraging the information space to push their narratives about the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-intelligence-contests&quot;&gt;On Intelligence Contests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American University Professor Joshua Rovner suggests that activities in cyberspace are more about intelligence than the use of force. He argues that strategic behaviour in cyberspace will rarely surpass the threshold of armed conflict, but states will continuously engage in an “intelligence contest” through sabotage and covert action. Rovner defines the intelligence contest as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A race among adversaries to collect more and better information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A race to exploit information to improve one’s relative position.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reciprocal effort to covertly undermine adversary morale, institutions and alliances.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A contest to disable adversary capabilities through sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A campaign to preposition assets for intelligence collection in the event of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Countries recognise the importance of having an institution to engage in cyber operations – but it does not mean that all do so&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the concept seeks to illustrate is that the dynamics of contestation among states in cyberspace extend far beyond the tactics of cyber operations and the battlefield itself, and play into strategic competition among state and non-state actors. As noted by the UK’s National Cyber Force (NCF), while cyber operations are not expected to be strategically decisive, they are effective when “combined and co-ordinated with the activities of partners to achieve a shared goal”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies as much to cyber security as it does to offensive cyber. One example of the former is that in May 2023, Ukraine, Ireland, Iceland and Japan announced that they would officially join NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence. While the deal opens the door for greater exchange between NATO and non-NATO countries, the occasion sends a relevant message of expanding technical and strategic alignment between countries in the face of growing geopolitical contestation in the Indo-Pacific and amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offensive cyber capabilities should be seen as part of a much wider policy toolkit to respond to hostile activities in cyberspace. Likewise, offensive cyber capabilities can be used to respond to other threats such as terrorism, disinformation or child sexual exploitation. In short, a cyber incident does not necessarily merit a cyber response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2021, approximately 45 countries have launched military cyber organisations (that is, cyber commands) and nearly 35 of those possess an offensive mandate. While capacities and capabilities vary, both Western and non-Western countries recognise the importance of having an institution to engage in this contested environment – but it does not mean that all do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategies vary as to how countries engage in this contest. The US Cyber Command, which defends the Department of Defense’s information systems, supports joint force commanders with cyberspace operations, and defends the US from significant cyberattacks, has developed complementary concepts of “defend forward” and “persistent engagement”. Meanwhile, the UK’s NCF has published a document outlining operating principles for its own approach to offensive cyber which is in line with a broader vision outlined in the 2023 Integrated Review Refresh to deter, defend and compete across all domains. Central to the NCF’s approach is the doctrine of “cognitive effect”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, should we then consider “intelligence contest” as the most accurate means of defining the nature of cyber operations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics of the concept have argued that the scale and scope of operations in cyberspace fundamentally change the nature of intelligence (especially covert action), resulting in a “difference in kind and not merely degree”. As some have argued, the 2016 Russian interference during the US elections shows that smaller activities can result in aggregated strategic effects – eroding trust and confidence in society. So, what are the consequences of framing cyber operations as an intelligence contest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsible-cyber-operations--long-road-ahead&quot;&gt;Responsible Cyber Operations – Long Road Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One risk when intelligence becomes the main qualifier to describe the nature of cyber operations is that it could alter public perceptions on what activities their government is conducting in cyberspace. Public understanding may also differ depending upon the oversight mechanisms in place within a particular national context. The outcome of framing cyber operations around intelligence activities could be for better or worse, depending upon the national context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cyber might play a significantly different role depending on the respective country’s primary threat concern&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the UK has a detailed regulatory framework when it comes to intelligence activity. In addition, the NCF’s recent guide outlines the importance of robust oversight and accountability as a core element for responsible operational planning – a key part of our latest project at RUSI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, less capable states contract cyber mercenaries for easier access to opportunities in developing and deploying capabilities. While commercial hacking tools have legitimate applications in support of national security and law enforcement objectives, they are also subject to misuse and abuse. As of 2023, 74 countries have reportedly used spyware and between 2015 and 2017, and EU member states have allowed surveillance technology to be exported more than 317 times. It is not always the case that states will contract well-known spyware vendors either – there is a complex market of companies promoting open-source intelligence tools that can be coupled with other sophisticated add-ons and services. In this regard, the intelligence contest concept does not help with addressing these kinds of dynamics. Instead of clarifying what kinds of intelligence activities are permissible, it overemphasises state-to-state spying rather than domestic activities – usually more appealing to less developed economies that can buy off-the-shelf products to meet their internal needs. What is then the applicability of the intelligence contest? To whom does this concept apply?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand the motivations of countries beyond the usual cyber powers in developing and deploying cyber capabilities. As illustrated by Saudi Arabia, Mexico, India and many other Western and non-Western countries, it might be more profitable for countries to develop their own cyber capabilities to conduct surveillance of citizens within their own national territory and abroad than to primarily do it among states. As states across the development spectrum enhance their capabilities, cyber might play a significantly different role depending on the respective country’s primary threat concern – which in turn will also affect how they engage in strategic competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries might also be influenced by the NCF’s guide on cyber operations, as it provides some initial thoughts for establishing processes and guidance relating to cyber operations. However, there is a risk that some countries will see cyber operations as intelligence activity only, to be conducted against a foreign or external threat. A different and more worrying scenario takes place when countries seek to aggressively use capabilities against internal threats, with little oversight, as has been the case with commercial hacking tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-contest-for-a-few&quot;&gt;A Contest for a Few?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crucial and yet overlooked question within this debate is: “who can engage in this intelligence contest?” While many countries have developed cyber commands and have sought to enhance their capabilities, the intelligence contest still arguably remains a game to be played by a small group of countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be too much to assume that countries beyond the pool of cyber powers can effectively achieve significant cumulative effects through cyberspace in conjunction with other diplomatic and/or commercial strategies, despite their eagerness to outsource capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the 45 countries that have established military cyber organisations (and others) will continue to search for other levers to develop their own capacities, away from cyber. It is also questionable how applicable and operationalisable the intelligence contest in cyberspace is for developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, how the term “intelligence contest” increases the understanding of cyber operations remains unclear. There are geographical, capability and conceptual challenges as well as consequences of the framing that require further assessment. Regardless, it is better than using the term “cyber war” to define state activity in cyberspace – although whether that is enough is yet to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-legacy-of-collaboration-at-risk&quot;&gt;A Legacy of Collaboration at Risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In West Africa, a new breed of rice that can withstand flooding and drought has allowed farmers to triple their productivity, improving local economies and feeding thousands of people. In regions from South America to Scotland, new green technologies are generating an abundance of clean energy. And in Southeast Asia, hundreds of millions of children have been protected from deadly Japanese encephalitis through life-saving vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these projects is contributing significantly to the collective future of humans and the planet. And all of them hinge on partnerships in health, technology, and business between the United States and its greatest strategic rival: China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the Green Super Rice feeding thousands in West Africa, for example. It leverages 40 years of Chinese research on rice seeds accelerated with the financial muscle of U.S. philanthropy. Meanwhile, China’s ability to develop and produce low-cost vaccines — for safeguarding the health of its own enormous population as well as supporting millions in the Global South — has been bolstered by know-how and support from the West, particularly through global health research collaborations, assistance with regulatory reforms, and the navigation of global qualification and distribution channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples, but a tiny sample of social impact collaborations underway around the world, remind us that endeavors advancing human health and development often fall beyond the purview of any single country; multinational and multisectoral partnerships are increasingly required. Specifically, they underscore the importance of continued engagement by two of the world’s greatest economic and technological powers, as well as the need to find ways to continue such collaborations in smart, informed, geopolitically sensitive, and mutually beneficial models. Truly game-changing innovations and opportunities with great social impact are within reach; and yet, many will depend on initiating, continuing, or expanding collaborations between partners in the United States and China to augment the global public good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this reality sits alongside stark and uncontestable truths: that the relationship between the United States and China over the past 10 years has worsened to one of its lowest historical ebbs, that policy and national sentiment have negatively reshaped the countries’ perceptions of — and working exchanges with — each other, and that we are in an era of aggressive competition that threatens progress in some of this work. As the trajectory of this new great power competition continues to play out, what will happen to the substantial historical legacy of partnership between these two nations on issues of critical social impact? Will it be possible for would-be collaborators on either side of the Pacific to navigate these rocky waters without being immobilized by political risk, thwarted by sanctions, or hamstrung by the potential for reputational damage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes are high. Between global climate change, food insecurity, and the very real threat of future pandemics, humanity is facing truly existential challenges. Against that backdrop, it is imperative to examine these opportunities and constraints, then reimagine new mechanisms and narratives — safe harbors — where China and the United States can continue to leverage their collective expertise for the global public good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay explores the reasons such a dialogue is needed, the risks at play, and some options for moving forward. Its aim is not to wish away deeply competitive features of the U.S.-China relationship, but rather to accept that these dynamics will persist and then generate understanding of and support for actively reimagining U.S.-China transnational collaborations in key areas of development. It seeks to advance thinking around ways to identify and pursue opportunities that support U.S. interests for multilateral social impact projects with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is imperative to examine these opportunities and constraints, then reimagine new mechanisms and narratives — safe harbors — where China and the United States can continue to leverage their collective expertise for the global public good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not take an expert to appreciate that the relationship between China and the United States is among the most complex, fraught, and critical on earth. Nor does this paper suggest that U.S. policies toward China — or vice versa — are misguided. Quite the contrary. Albeit without access to much of the intelligence behind the current stances, this is written with full awareness of the many potential threats that each nation perceives in the other. Acknowledging the realities — and the fact that aggressive competition between these two powers is only likely to increase — this essay proposes that we need a new set of principles and mechanisms to guide continued collaboration among scientists and activists in health, climate, food security, and humanitarian relief. The well-being of the world depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-journey-toward-global-development-impact&quot;&gt;China’s Journey toward Global Development Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among confrontational policies, rhetoric, and media coverage, it is easy to lose sight of or underappreciate China’s historical and current role in global development. In part, China’s work in countries across much of the Global South, with deep roots in the “South-South” brotherhood of developing economies starting back in the 1950s, is hard to track or understand. China’s historical role in global aid and development has often been opaque — deeply tied to its political interests in specific countries, often delivered as part of infrastructure or other economic packages, and generally done through bilateral (state-to-state) mechanisms or as part of larger investment deals. Without delving into a discourse on China’s philosophy and approach to global development, of which there are many, suffice it to say that China has taken a very different route from the West. Most notably, China has been slow to embrace multilateral initiatives (through large multicountry organizations) or to actively participate in large globally coordinated development or humanitarian initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, the many strands of China’s international collaboration have knitted together a clear commitment and broad narrative that are increasingly notable in terms of their scale and political importance. A range of bilateral scientific projects in health, agriculture, water and sanitation, and climate greatly expanded in the 1990s through the 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at global health as an example, U.S.-China collaboration quickly expanded after the two countries’ relations were normalized in 1979, particularly through exchanges and knowledge sharing with experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who worked with partner organizations to lay the health infrastructure groundwork that led to the establishment of China’s own CDC in 2001. With support from U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and coordination from regulatory authorities like the World Health Organization (WHO), China has become an essential linchpin in helping to eradicate polio through vaccine production and monitoring systems. China has also played a major role in combating tuberculosis (TB) and malaria — two of the world’s top infectious killers — by working with the World Bank, the British Department for International Development, Japan, the Netherlands, the WHO, the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and other international NGOs to dramatically cut infection rates through improved detection, technology, and treatment. Altogether, China’s work on TB has benefited some 668 million people, prompting the World Bank’s lead economist studying health in East Asia to call it “one of the most successful TB projects ever seen.” China also brought lessons learned in the fight against malaria to Africa. Its research program to find new treatments for malaria led to the discovery of artemisinin, now the basis of the world’s most effective antimalarial drugs. Overall, in the words of Pedro Alonso, director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme, China’s healthcare advancements have had a global “ripple effect.” This success was not solely the result of international aid. China’s spending on research and development in 2017 — at $200 billion — was nearly seven times its investment just a decade earlier, much of it in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these collaborations have taken on a different tone and approach in the past decade. President Xi Jinping has embarked on an aggressive campaign to build China’s geopolitical influence, especially with the Global South, and has placed global health and development as a critical piece of that work. Such initiatives include a broad set of mechanisms, and approaches include the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) for infrastructure development involving 70 countries across South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa; the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a multilateral cooperative making social-improvement loans available to 91 member nations; and, more recently, a Global Development Initiative to aid nations’ continued recovery from the economic devastations of Covid-19. In his 2021 speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Xi explicitly stated that China would use its growing global influence to further the public good in science, food security, and other areas, calling on the world community to join in renewing a shared commitment to balanced, inclusive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, the impact of these ambitious-sounding initiatives has been unclear and comparatively modest, depending on whether you are measuring political influence or actual social development impact. Some argue that these have been poorly executed approaches driven by China’s agenda to expand its economic and strategic interests across the world; others see them as glimmers of potential for the possibility of using the enormous resources, manpower, and research capacity of the world’s second-largest economy to focus on critical global issues. For the latter to be realized, China needs to dispel anxiety by clearly demonstrating that these initiatives work for their intended beneficiaries, not just China’s interests. Regardless, they certainly represent notable change in a country long criticized for failing to address global poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china-and-the-united-states-working-together&quot;&gt;China and the United States Working Together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this context, many of China’s international collaborations have focused on global social impact by partnering with various U.S. organizations. In some cases, these partnerships have lasted more than a century. The Rockefeller Foundation, for instance, has maintained significant programs in China since 1913, funding — and shaping — the education of generations of doctors at Peking Union Medical College, as well as supporting humanitarian causes during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since opening its Beijing office in 2007, the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has managed a portfolio of philanthropic grants and initiatives that includes programs to help China improve the quality of its medical products toward normative international standards, as well as contribute efforts to the fight against TB, HIV, and other diseases in China. The Gates Foundation has also provided technical assistance and support to Chinese efforts directed at low resource needs elsewhere in the world, including safe Chinese vaccines, innovations in agriculture and sanitation, and improved scientific research opportunities between Chinese and global scientists. In conjunction with the Beijing Municipal Government, the foundation launched and co-funded the Global Health Drug Discovery Institute (GHDDI), based at Tsinghua University, to help orient and leverage research and innovation toward critical diseases across the globe for which cures and treatments are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Gates Foundation is actually a latecomer. The Asia Foundation has been active in China since the late 1970s. The World Wildlife Fund has been working to promote conservation efforts in China — from forest management to wetlands conservation and species protection — since 1980. Johns Hopkins University and Nanjing University opened the Hopkins-Nanjing Center for Chinese and American Studies in 1986. The Ford Foundation began working on U.S.-China issues in the 1960s through funding China studies centers in the United States, before establishing a Beijing office in 1988. Greenpeace has been working there since 1997. And the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the U.S. side, this long association attests to the fact that for decades, the United States valued international exchanges as a form of “soft diplomacy.” The first Fulbright agreement signed by the United States was with China in 1947. And even during the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, U.S.-funded exchange programs supported some 20,000 international students for study in the United States each year. An increasingly large proportion of them have come from China. By 2019, 370,000 students from China were enrolled in U.S. schools, accounting for about 34 percent of foreign students in the United States. Most Chinese students in the United States have indicated a strong desire to stay in the United States, which underscores the importance of the programs but increasingly raises concerns in both Beijing and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China welcomed these partnerships as well for many years — in part as a recipient of aid as a developing country with health and development programs focused on China, and in part as a component of its expanding global footprint across Africa and other regions of the globe, where it also has a strategic interest in “soft power” politics. The technical assistance provided to Chinese government agencies, academic institutions, and even companies through these programs significantly elevated China’s know-how and engagement on critical social issues, and even today it continues to be welcomed by Chinese and U.S. authorities on specific issues such as HIV/AIDS prevention and cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-geopolitical-winds&quot;&gt;Changing Geopolitical Winds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many international observers hoped that mounting tensions between China and the United States would be a passing phase, provoked by Donald Trump’s anti-China rhetoric and vanishing with his exit from office. Others suggested that as Xi Jinping consolidated power with a third term as leader of the Chinese Communist Party, his antipathy toward the United States might ease. But the divide has only become more entrenched, with the Biden administration solidifying a framing of China as the primary U.S. strategic competitor with numerous policies, sanctions, and commitments, and the Xi administration expanding its anti-U.S. policies and rhetoric. With schisms playing out militarily, technologically, economically, and ideologically, more observers are speaking in cold war terms — and expressing concerns about the potential for some event, such as a confrontation over Taiwan, to trigger a “hot war.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been written by foreign policy experts about the nature and origins of this divide. This essay does not reiterate that analysis but hopes to advance a discussion of global good collaboration with full acknowledgement of the challenging landscape. Within a context of mutual distrust, the international community will need to develop new narratives and mechanisms through which academics and advocates can continue to make progress on urgent humanitarian needs. And it must undertake this quest while still struggling with the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war, which have added thorny new layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one time, health-related collaborations were viewed as politically acceptable, a safe harbor shielded from politics. But the panic and confusion around Covid-19 upended that tradition. First, questions about the origins of the virus itself — and whether it came from a lab in Wuhan — did significant damage to whatever trust existed between China and the West around common health concerns. The resulting accusations, misinformation, and counter-misinformation have created considerable tension. That fracture was compounded by questions about the WHO and whether it had helped China to cover its tracks during the first weeks of the pandemic. Later, new global tensions arose amid poor alignment between China and the West on confronting the pandemic. It has become increasingly difficult to understand how scientists and policymakers can rebuild trust in preparing for or responding to a future epidemic, although it is a hopeful sign that both countries contributed to the emerging Pandemic Fund established by the World Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At one time, health-related collaborations were viewed as politically acceptable, a safe harbor shielded from politics. But the panic and confusion around Covid-19 upended that tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s refusal to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and indeed its amplification of Russian propaganda about the invasion, has further strained U.S.-China relations. Even though China has refused to supply lethal assistance to Russia, it has significantly increased its economic links with its northern neighbor. In short, this inhospitable environment for strengthening or expanding critical collaborations has forced many partners to play defense in order to sustain any momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-chilling-impact-on-global-collaboration&quot;&gt;A Chilling Impact on Global Collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of this challenging political environment and this era of great power competition, collaboration on social issues like health, climate, and agriculture has been disrupted or slowed down, and the future of this important work is becoming increasingly hazy. Data and anecdotes abound, from the dramatic drop of exchange programs mentioned above, to the fear of sanctions impacting scientific research, to Chinese interference with foreign companies’ activities, to the U.S. government’s approach to scientists and scholars of Chinese origins, and beyond. Over the past 10 years, several foreign NGOs operating in China have withdrawn or reduced services voluntarily or involuntarily, including Mercy Corps, Habitat for Humanity, and the Li Ka Shing Foundation. While difficult to ascertain, the amount of foreign philanthropy donated to China has also decreased, and the number of life science research collaborations have been curtailed, due more to geopolitical tensions than the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues are more than rhetorical; they directly impact the operations of organizations working to collaborate. Under China’s new Foreign NGO Law, all social sector activities are now subject to increased oversight by the Public Security Bureau. Partnerships with China also must operate within a new environment in the United States: bipartisan support of anti-China policies and increased scrutiny about its activities by government agencies and political leaders. Rigorous vigilance and full transparency are always wise when working on such issues, but this new climate creates a tangle of new bureaucracies and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far more challenging is the potential chilling effect of these government policies on mid-level bureaucrats. This is true on both sides of the Pacific. With officials disinclined to pursue any opportunity that might suggest political endorsement, social impact activists confront a distinct paralysis — a hesitance to go after even the lowest-hanging fruit. During the Covid-19 pandemic, many global offers to China for support or interventions from foreign parties, for example non-Chinese mRNA vaccines, were not even considered by many Chinese officials given the political sensitivities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chilling effect has also impacted scientific collaborations. Jenny J. Lee, a professor at the Center for the Study of Higher Education at the University of Arizona, surveyed scientists, professors, and graduate students at 83 U.S. universities to determine how U.S.-China political policies were affecting research. More than 42 percent of Chinese scientists said they felt they were being racially profiled, even surveilled, by the U.S. government. Nearly 20 percent said that over the past three years they had prematurely or unexpectedly ended or suspended collaborations with colleagues in China. “This is actually undermining the U.S.’s ability to be globally competitive,” Lee observed. “Scientists are less likely to collaborate with China, less likely to host Chinese scientists, less inclined to apply for federal funding, which means smaller projects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like in every country, there are always challenging “red zones” around social impact work; in China, these include any effort to advance democracy or human rights, as well as any focus on Tibet, Xinjiang, or Taiwan. The strain around those engagements has flowed into other areas — such as data sharing or the use of technologies that raise concerns about misuse or national security concerns. Any such collaborations with commercial players must carefully consider the implications of a growing list of entities for which sanctions might apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this decoupling continues, and neither Chinese nor U.S. authorities and non-state actors provide clearer opportunities for collaboration, the chances of tackling major global challenges will be diminished. Partnerships between organizations from both the United States and China remain essential as they study, prepare for, and respond to issues on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities-for-safe-harbors-ahead&quot;&gt;Opportunities for Safe Harbors Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news in this dire scenario is that both governments recognize these risks. High-level officials on both sides of the Pacific have made clear public statements about the potential for further collaboration advancing the global good. In the fall of 2021, both countries surprised the world by issuing a joint statement at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow. “In the area of climate change, there is more agreement between China and the U.S. than divergence, making it an area with huge potential for our cooperation,” said Xie Zhenhua, China’s chief negotiator on climate. John Kerry, the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, echoed the same: “The United States and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate, cooperation is the only way to get this job done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, the June 2023 meeting between President Xi and Secretary Blinken in Beijing reportedly focused on broader areas for cooperation. According to China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, “President Xi pointed out that the two sides need to remain committed to the common understandings he and President Biden had reached in Bali, and translate the positive statements into actions so as to stabilize and improve China-U.S. relations.” Blinken reiterated that both sides “agree on the need to stabilize our relationship” and that China and the United States should focus on areas of common interests. As Singapore foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan commented when meeting Blinken ahead of his trip to Beijing, “There are many global, planetary issues — climate, pandemics, even cyber security — which require the United States and China to work off the same page and be key pillars for a global system which will help increase resilience to threats to welfare, health and prosperity for people all over the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The less-good news is that these statements have been vague, sometimes contradictory, and generally unsupported by details about the policies, mechanisms, timeline, or authority under which any such partnerships might advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why the discussion is so urgent: the situation calls for nongovernment actors — perhaps a consortium of foundations, NGOs, or research institutions — to fill in the gaps and delineate safe harbors for collaboration in the waters ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several hopeful strands of government-approved policies and civil society engagements to build upon. Beyond the climate engagements, there have been several track 1.5 or 2.0 dialogues between key Chinese and U.S. actors regarding global health and other issues. Policies that would have had enormous unintended consequences on global health and food security, such as proposed legislative language to prohibit China-sourced elements in any vaccines as part of the U.S. commitment to fund Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, have been avoided. In addition, new broad-based commitments on both sides of the Pacific, like the Biden administration’s “Invest, Align, Compete” policy and Beijing’s new Global Development Initiative, might offer political frameworks in which potential collaborations could be advanced, though there is much uncertainty about both models. There have been additional commitments by both the United States and China to multilateral mechanisms such as the UN World Food Programme and the new Pandemic Preparation Financial Intermediary Fund of the World Bank, which offer some ideas for further alignment and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That is why the discussion is so urgent: the situation calls for nongovernment actors — perhaps a consortium of foundations, NGOs, or research institutions — to fill in the gaps and delineate safe harbors for collaboration in the waters ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these are promising islands of hope in the increasingly turbulent sea of issues, more directed and focused efforts are needed. This could be structured joint initiatives that are clear in their global social goals (and not related to national security) and detached from politics at home, along the lines of the Global Health Drug Discovery Institute referenced above; agreements for exchange of data and information that are shaped and managed in a way that both countries might accept, for instance on pandemic early-warning systems; or more philanthropic-led joint initiatives to collaborate in the case of third-country humanitarian responses, such as the cooperation during the West Africa Ebola epidemic. But given the new moment and particular conditions of the current great power competition, the parties at hand also need to both study how this has been done in the past and reimagine better ways for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;global-precedents&quot;&gt;Global Precedents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these discussions, seizing the opportunity to create safe harbors for continued collaboration feels urgent. And we can look to history as a guide. Effective social impact partnerships, even during intense confrontation, are not unprecedented. In fact, examples abound. China and the United States can take inspiration from mechanisms such as the water-sharing agreement between India and Pakistan that has endured since 1960, despite the two countries’ strained political relationship; the “humanitarian pauses” that evacuated civilians from conflict zones like Israel/Palestine and Syria; or vaccination campaigns and other public health risk-mitigation work undertaken during refugee crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most relevant example is the highly successful “science diplomacy” campaign between the Soviet Union and the United States that eradicated smallpox during the height of the Cold War, when U.S. virologist Albert Sabin worked with two Soviet virologists to produce an oral polio vaccine — even as all three were being watched by a suspected KGB agent at Sabin’s lab in Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the vaccine was tested, deemed safe by the WHO, and licensed for production, Soviet scientists developed the technology for producing hundreds of millions of doses. Together, this health-focused collaboration between two political rivals eradicated smallpox in two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-now&quot;&gt;What Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, most observers believe prospects for accelerating development impact work with China over the next decade look grim. But social impact activists are realists, driven by optimism. To build collaboration, there are two needs upon which to focus: a more nuanced narrative regarding U.S.-China relations and a reimagined, clearer set of mechanisms for creating safe harbors for collaborative endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;narrative&quot;&gt;Narrative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shaping a new narrative in the midst of hardline government policies is difficult. But it is critical to emphasize an effort mission-driven by social impact concerns, rather than politics. At a minimum, a new framing can outline the ways in which non-state actors (such as NGOs, philanthropies, and businesses) are uniquely well positioned to continue shaping collaborative programs in areas of mutual self-interest, all without violating their respective governments’ policies or approaches. Most importantly, the narrative must make plain that these relationships are not part of a zero-sum game, where one side wins and the other loses. Rather, in thinking about climate change mitigation, global public health, food security, and development financing, it is more effective — and realistic — to advance an “all boats rising” perspective. Mutual self-interest in Washington and Beijing can drive progress in all of these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mechanisms&quot;&gt;Mechanisms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any meaningful discussion also would need to explore the actual mechanisms through which collaborations could flourish. What those are and how they should work is beyond the scope of this essay. But the examples provided may offer inspiration for new efforts to pick up the baton and stride forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding opportunities for engagement might start, for example, with “surgical strikes” on climate and health — targeted partnerships on key issues. Would such discrete efforts be sustainable? In an environment of conflict, would innovators, activists, and officials have the “cover” they need to devise creative solutions to the world’s shared problems? One model for action might involve a coalition of like-minded think tanks and philanthropies, acting in alignment with both governments while operating independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector may offer hints too. For example, a major boost to the World Wildlife Fund’s work on conservation in China came from Apple, the electronics company, which partnered with the wildlife group in 2015 to work with Chinese forestry companies on ways to reduce logging impacts, mitigate fire risk and chemical use, and increase worker safety. China — the world’s largest consumer and producer of paper products — has since protected 1 million acres of forestland in accordance with standards set by the international Forest Steward Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the consequences of getting this wrong are not trivial. While it is not hard to imagine a group of Western non-state actors operating in the sort of model sketched above, nothing in China is so neatly separated from government oversight. This reality would naturally raise concerns that the independence of one side could be weaponized by the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, would China be acting as China alone, or as a representative of the developing world? In an era of democratic decline, could collaboration with China end up aiding authoritarian regimes around the globe? For example, if Washington supported making qualified, lower-priced, China-sourced drugs widespread for fighting disease in sub-Saharan Africa, might it risk subsidizing an emerging marketplace that would advantage China economically, against the United States?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-way-forward&quot;&gt;The Way Forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forty years witnessing the impact of human-to-human work on areas of mutual concern across borders and boundaries reinforces the conviction that it is possible to build partnerships that run complementary to government policy, even in authoritarian states. Yes, the questions outlined in this essay are complex. But the problems confronting our planet demand that the United States fight its way through them with China as a partner — if only in this limited context. The first step forward lies in refining the narrative that frames this work. Brookings and CSIS have already begun that important conversation, jointly launching the Advancing Collaboration in an Era of Strategic Competition project earlier this year. The purpose of this essay is to deepen it — and to turn up the volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ventures like this will always attract naysayers, who attribute any positive response from China as stemming entirely from national self-interest. But experience while running the global health nonprofit PATH offers another interpretation. At the time, China had a vaccine for Japanese encephalitis that had protected millions of Chinese children, while other global sources were too expensive for the markets in Southeast Asia where the disease was rampant. When PATH approached the Chinese manufacturer, the Chengdu Institute of Biological Products (CDIBP), about making its vaccine available outside the country’s borders, cost-benefit analyses and political chess were trumped by defining a common goal that would greatly benefit many children, which could not be done without working together. Over 300 million children have been protected from a terrible disease through this collaboration. “When it became evident that this vaccine could change the world,” one leader on the project later recalled, “[CDIBP] said, ‘What do we need to do?’”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李予信完成作供 指黨否決財案「統一口徑」無約束力、從無講過亦無採納&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0ounAPi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（22日）踏入審訊第111天。李予信今續接受盤問，就被搜得的初選論壇筆記不止一次提及否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求，李指只是公民黨資深顧問抄黨的「Line to take（統一口徑）」，但理解非百分百要求候選人說出當中內容，只是參考、無約束力，視乎臨場發揮和「自己想唔想講」，他在論壇「從來冇講過亦從來冇採納過」。法官質疑，若公民黨候選人可自由偏離黨的統一口徑，那制定有什麼意思？李指為「原則性嘅展示」、「展示緊黨嘅一啲態度為先」，但各區區情、每名候選人身分等均不同，故實際上講法也不一樣。而就另一份黨的統一口徑文件提到避免講「攬炒」，李指公民黨不支持「攬炒」，但又提否決預算案是「有矛盾」和彈性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，李亦否認自己當選後打算跟從黨立場，重申雖無向公眾表明，但有透過選舉宣傳暗示此訊息。李予信今完成4日作供，明將由本案最後一名被告、參選衞生服務界的余慧明作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李指成為候選人後無深究墨落無悔不太重視該聲明&quot;&gt;李指成為候選人後無深究「墨落無悔」、不太重視該聲明&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信今繼續接受盤問，就公民黨6月11日簽署的「墨落無悔」聲明，李早前供稱無參與任何討論、與他無關，指他當時並非潛在候選人，「我冇去關心」。李今在盤問下指，他於6月13日後才獲准參選，而參選前很多政治人物和參選人也有分享該聲明，故他知悉亦有「快䁽過」，但在正式成為候選人後就無再繼續深究，「因為當時我唔係好重視呢個聲明。」李又指，不知道公民黨「用個黨嘅名擺喺個聲明度呢個動作」，但從黨的帖文看到其聲稱自己加入了聯署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示該6月11日的帖文，提及「公民黨已加入聯署【墨落無悔 堅定抗爭】聲明書」，又提到「我們早於3月25日召開記者招待會，當時已承諾尊重民主派初選機制；立會過半後政府必須落實五大訴求，否則公民黨將行使《基本法》賦予的否決權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李指賴仁彪無畀壓力一定要講某啲承諾理解為彈性&quot;&gt;李指賴仁彪「無畀壓力一定要講某啲承諾」、理解為彈性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪指，帖文無提及就否決預算案有彈性，但李早前指譚文豪曾向他稱「有彈性」，李看到帖文後有問譚嗎？李指他沒有問，譚於5月底的會面亦沒有承諾他當選後會給予彈性，但譚「鼓勵我繼續持有我本來所講嘅政綱」，並指李選超區時要謹守他作為街頭舞蹈藝術家和社工區議員兩個「好特別嘅身分」，指其政綱與身分相連，因此李理解該彈性「係展現於鼓勵我繼續持有呢個政綱呢件事上面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，彈性也體現於6月13日後，賴仁彪指黨可讓他參選，「我理解係黨能夠用佢嘅資源去支持我作為一個候選人嘅選舉理念同政綱，佢亦都冇畀我任何嘅壓力，要我一定要講某啲嘅承諾。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李指黨統一口徑無約束力非百分百嚴格要求候選人講&quot;&gt;李指黨「統一口徑」無約束力、非百分百嚴格要求候選人講&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，鄭達鴻被搜出選舉「論壇天書」，李予信也有收到類似的文件嗎？李指有，解釋準備選舉時，黨資深顧問 Masun 負責撰寫「line to take（統一口徑）」，該顧問也會參與候選人的媒體訓練（media training），並因每區的區情、形勢和關注點也不一樣，而「落去同我哋候選人傾一個 tailor made 嘅講法」，「所以我理解嗰個 line to take 唔係完全一百分之一百 strictly 要求候選人 exact wording 去講嗰啲嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示從李搜得、題為「Draft 5 LTT」的文件，李解釋是黨整體使用的統一口徑，不止有5個版本，但不記得共有多少；至於另一份「初選論壇（4/7錄影）」，李解釋主要為論壇準備，由資深黨顧問和李競選團隊一兩個成員草擬和修改，參考黨的統一口徑再加上自己區情形勢寫成。李指他知道內容，且「最緊要就係，其實呢份 document 只係一個參考，而所有論壇表現好睇臨場嘅發揮、同埋我自己想唔想講，係冇約束力嘅」。李又指，該文件最原始版本應在6月，其後不斷更改，最新版本為7月2、3日，但不肯定呈堂文件是否最新。他同意超區論壇於7月4日錄影，7月6日廣播。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 李予信&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李指公民黨唔畀講攬炒又反對財案有矛盾-曾與資深顧問談及&quot;&gt;李指公民黨「唔畀講『攬炒』」又反對財案有矛盾 曾與資深顧問談及&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「Draft 5 LTT」提到「避免自己講『攬炒』字眼」，李同意是公民黨一貫看法；文件亦提及「35+後否決預算案，令政府停擺，就是攬炒，令香港民不聊生」，以及民主派如議會過半「提出否決政府議案，係我哋反制暴政嘅強力武器，其實係俾最後一次機會林鄭政府去回應市民嘅訴求，只要政府同意回應五大訴求、重啟政改，同埋撤回國安法，民主派就會按照正常方式審議政府議案，根本唔會停擺」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問李收到文件後，曾否向黨資深顧問表示不同意？李指該段文字「其實就係反映黨嘅立場嘅彈性嘅存在，不過好模糊地存在」，因公民黨不支持「攬炒」，「佢都識講，『攬炒』會令到民不聊生」，但同時又有否決預算案的說法，「唔畀講『攬炒』又講反對財政預算案」，「兩者係矛盾嘅。」李指他有與顧問馬生談過該「立場上嘅彈性同矛盾」，馬針對其街舞藝術家和社工區議員身分，着李「講返我想講嘅嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇文件提勿太老實勿有問必答-李指為論壇技巧因論壇非100講道理&quot;&gt;論壇文件提勿太老實、勿有問必答 李指為論壇技巧、因論壇非100%講道理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示「初選論壇（4/7錄影）」文件，法官關注寫有「X太老實 X有問必答」。李指是論壇技巧，「佢意思係唔好人哋問咩你就講晒咁多咁」，陳志全發笑。陳慶偉指，因此李是在誤導？李否認，陳追問何謂「X太老實」，李答「因為政治嘅論壇唔係講緊道理」，陳慶偉發笑，李遂更正「應該唔係講緊100%嘅道理」。李運騰微笑問，即有些問題並非真問題，而是陷阱？李說「可以咁樣講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，李是說他們不要相信政治人物所說的話？李指政治人物發言時要強調一些訊息，喚起更多關注，「依啲都可以好有理性基礎，但係喺論壇上面，因為個時間好短，可能叫你十秒回應一個好大嘅議題，咁你就要記得自己好想畀公眾知道嘅理念。」李運騰說，基本上就是說他想說的話，李說「其實我係咁理解嘅」。法官陳仲衡續說，「不要在庭上這樣做，重要是先答問題，之後再提供解釋」，旁聽發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;統一口徑提35後以否決權迫政權落實五大訴求-李稱從無講過也無採納&quot;&gt;「統一口徑」提35+後以否決權迫政權落實五大訴求 李稱從無講過也無採納&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續說，「我的問題不是一個陷阱，而是一個真正的問題」，法官陳慶偉和陳志全發笑。控方續展示李的論壇文件，提到：「入到立法會第一件事想做啲咩？35+後以否決權迫令政權落實五大訴求，係我哋當今出選人嘅共識。」李解釋「呢個係抄返（黨）LTT（Line to take），一模一樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續向李指出，他當時知道初選候選人有共識否決預算案爭取五大訴求，惟陳慶偉指控方要記得李沒有出席過協調會。李續回應他不知道，亦不同意控方指他知道，「因為我連黨入面都觀察到有唔同立場，民主派陣營亦都有唔同嘅講法，我嘅論壇入面都顯示緊呢個事實。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，李事實上曾否於選舉論壇採納該句「Line to take」？李說：「從來冇講過亦從來冇採納過。」萬德豪問李沒有講過是否因為無人這樣問，惟陳慶偉即打斷指留待陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑如可自由偏離制定統一口徑有何意思-李原則性展示&quot;&gt;官質疑如可自由偏離、制定統一口徑有何意思 李：原則性展示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引文件提到「能夠做到議會過半真係好重要，咁我哋先可以反制暴政，喺議會裡面擋住23條呢啲惡法，另一方面可以透過否決所有政府提出嘅議案同撥款，包括財政預算案，逼使政府重啟政改、落實五大訴求」。李指該句「都係抄（黨）LLT，都係馬生嘅作品」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，所以這是馬生想李說的話？李說不肯定，但指團隊會將相關資料放在一起給他看，他不記得有否跟馬說不會於論壇提，「但最尾我係冇講嘅一定。」萬德豪續問，而否決財案的部分一直在所有類似文件出現？李同意，指「我理解都係抄黨嘅 LTT，亦都有我冇講嘅部分」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，有趣地所有公民黨參選人也有相同的統一口徑，那如他們可以自由偏離黨的統一口徑，那制定統一口徑有什麼意思？（“… free to deviate from the LTT, then what’s the point of having one?”）李表示，「其實 LTT 係一個展示緊黨嘅一啲態度為先，但實際上嘅講法呢，每個候選人嘅身分、佢所代表嘅業界利益，同埋地區直選嘅區情，都係會好唔一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡打斷指，因此有 LTT，但也有個別和不同（exemptions and disagreement）的情況？李說「係，可以咁理解，係有彈性」。李運騰指他明白有彈性，但若分歧大到根本連一個共同共識也沒有，「為何要有這個統一口徑？（“Why bother to have this line to take?”）」李說：「我理解為係一個原則性嘅展示，例如一國兩制⋯⋯」惟陳慶偉即打斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李無告訴公眾不跟黨立場否決-但指宣傳有暗示此訊息&quot;&gt;李無告訴公眾不跟黨立場否決 但指宣傳有暗示此訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示李予信的論壇「Drilling Record」文件，提到「自己政綱／議題（夾黨）」，列出工廈、囚權、追究警暴等，李解釋即自己的政綱議題與黨議題「相夾到嘅地方」。李並解釋，「Drilling」指「media drilling」，是「一種練習嘅 session」，他會重複回答一些問題和重複自己想講的理念，「睇吓講得好唔好、有啲乜嘢改善、或者有啲咩嘢內容需要更正。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪最後問，李曾否告訴公眾他不會跟從黨立場，否決預算案以爭取五大訴求，李回應：「我冇咁樣講過，因為我有透過我嘅宣傳 imply 一個咁嘅訊息。」萬最後指出控方案情，指李當選後有意跟從黨立場，串謀與其他被告取得立會過半，無差別否決預算案，迫使政府回應五大訴求，李不同意。萬再指李有意顛覆國家政權，李答：「我無意顛覆國家政權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李作供完畢-余慧明將作供&quot;&gt;李作供完畢 余慧明將作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方盤問完結，大律師關文渭沒有覆問，李予信案情完結。代表本案最後一名被告余慧明的大律師石書銘表示，余會作供，料需時少於兩天，問現在抑或明日開始？法官陳慶偉指明日開始，林卓廷說：「吓？」案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，有旁聽人士向余慧明喊：「加油呀！努力呀！聽日見！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第110天。李予信繼續作供，表示超區初選落敗、宣布不參與立法會選舉後，7月底獲時任黨魁楊岳橋指示報名參選港島，理解楊當時因DQ憂慮而作出準備。李指郭榮鏗、楊岳橋和郭家麒三人被DQ後，楊一度要他停止申請，惟他已交表、未能取回表格，向楊表示「好 frustrate」，楊則回答「阿信，it’s OK」，李其後得悉原參選港島的鄭達鴻同被DQ。不過李表示，理解他並非鄭達鴻的「Plan B」，他交表前亦不曾諮詢或通知鄭達鴻。此外，原表示擬不作供、參選衞生服務界的余慧明，其代表大狀指索取指示後，余將會作供。余為本案最後一名被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選超區的前公民黨東區區議員李予信繼續作供，他早前供稱於超區初選落敗，於7月15日宣布不參與正式選舉，李今同意於2020年7月30日報名參與港島區立法會選舉，而他不曾參與港島區初選。李解釋，他於7月29日中午收到時任黨魁楊岳橋電話通知，指黨有機會徵召他參與港島區選舉。當時該區由鄭達鴻出選，李理解楊當時因DQ憂慮而作出一些準備，故在前一日要準備提名。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指當晚至翌日早上仍在找提名，取齊提名和填好表格後便等候指示，當時公民黨未有人被DQ。李並指7月30日下午約1時，楊岳橋致電他「叫我去入紙報名喇，可以」，李遂與助理一起到上環選舉事務處，約兩時多開始進行申請程序，提交逾100個提名及公民黨予他的5萬元現金按金。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指完成手續後獲發收據，行出大廳時便收到楊岳橋指示，當時郭榮鏗、楊岳橋和郭家麒已被DQ，楊「叫我去停止呢個申請動作」。李指他即回頭找職員，「就話我啱啱遞完張 form，但我而家想收返個申請」，惟職員拒絕，表示根據制度，退選只能透過正式申請一份退選申請書辦妥。李指職員其後給他一份文件，但記不清楚是否該表格，他並告訴楊岳橋「我收唔走嗰張申請」，「我向佢表示好 frustrate，因為攞唔返」，楊則回覆「阿信，it’s OK」，並叫他先回公民黨總部，容後再商討。李並於當天近4時、尚在選舉事務處時收到鄭達鴻被DQ的消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱立法會截止報名日-曾陪梁嘉善報名新西&quot;&gt;李稱立法會截止報名日 曾陪梁嘉善報名新西&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信同意，當晚約7時楊岳橋召開記招，交代有關DQ事宜，當時無人有時間再商討他收回申請一事。至記招完後，楊岳橋着李「hold 住個申請先，聽朝再算」。至7月31日的立法會正式選舉截止報名日期，李稱當天中午到曾獲通過排楊岳橋新東名單第二的梁嘉善辦公室，因他理解當時的討論「係究竟其他選區嘅好似我呢個情況徵召嘅人，報唔報名好」。李同意，理解梁嘉善同樣為被公民黨徵召的人，但不肯定其會員狀態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，看到梁收到指示要去報名參選新界西，並指「因為我係唯一一個一早報咗名嘅徵召者，所以31號我淨係坐喺度睇嘅啫」，並陪伴梁去報名。李在法官追問下指當時無人指示他要做什麼，「我純粹係陪伴佢，因為大家都係徵召者」，不過同日傍晚，政府宣布將選舉延後一年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱理解不是鄭達鴻plan-b交表前不曾諮詢或通知鄭達鴻&quot;&gt;李稱理解不是鄭達鴻「Plan B」、交表前不曾諮詢或通知鄭達鴻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭續展示選舉事務處的文件，顯示「Te-wing chi（戴穎姿）」於7月31日報名港島區。李理解戴與公民黨有關係，指於2016年認識戴，她當時為公民黨實習生，至2020年「應該係」鄭達鴻競選團隊員工，因他4至5月中探討成為鄭名單第二時曾在鄭的辦事處見過戴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，不知道戴是否被公民黨徵召參選和是否代表黨參選，也不知道她是否鄭達鴻「Plan B」。至於李本人，「我理解我唔係鄭生嘅Plan B」，但除他以外當時不知道公民黨有派其他人參選港島。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭續問，李是否從無被DQ，惟法官即打斷指當時選舉已延期。關續指，但李已交表，可於翌日被DQ，法官陳慶偉笑言「我不認為公務員是那麼有效率」，法官陳仲衡亦着辯方要現實。陳慶偉並指，認為辯方提出戴小姐的議題是完全與案無關。關續表示完成主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻的大律師黃宇逸其後進行盤問，李予信同意，他提交正選提名表格前不曾諮詢或通知鄭達鴻，亦不知鄭曾否被任何公民黨的人諮詢或通知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第110天。李予信今接受控方盤問，就楊岳橋於公民黨記者會指若政府不回應五大訴求，否決每個法案和撥款是「莊嚴承諾」，李指黨內議員以往也有投票不一致的情況，「so far 冇嘢可以 bound（綑綁）到所有公民黨立法會議員一致去投票」，亦認為該承諾未必會兌現。李又指就否決財案立場與黨不同，但無公開表達，遭法官質疑如他沒有黨的支持便「什麼也不是」，他要跟從黨立場。惟李指其政綱已反映他以選民利益為先，若黨不批准他豁免跟黨立場投票，「我都會照跟自己意向投票，就即管睇吓個黨有啲乜嘢嘅後果畀我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，《國安法》條文頒布後，認為提及否決權的政綱或違法，即通知團隊停派舊單張並設計新單張，將含有公民黨政綱的內容「全部放棄」。李又指，除目標議席外不知超區初選有其他協議，指多年來協調均談及議席和配票策略。李亦指他無收過超區協調文件，主控萬德豪指他至少有看過，惟法官李運騰質疑控方說法有何證據，指李並無被搜出該文件，「你是代表控方，你指出案情時要有基礎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑公民黨記者會非推廣選民登記-李指選民登記可助爭議會過半&quot;&gt;控方質疑公民黨記者會非推廣選民登記 李指選民登記可助爭議會過半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選超區的前公民黨東區區議員李予信今早完成主問，由主控萬德豪進行盤問。就前黨友鄭達鴻早前供稱黨團負責立法會最前線政策，李指「我當時咁樣猜測，但 actually 係點樣我唔清楚」；至於鄭稱黨團凌駕執委會，李亦稱不知道兩者互動實際上是怎樣，「無從評論邊個高權力啲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就公民黨3月25日記者會，楊岳橋提到若特首不回應五大訴求，「公民黨係會同佢唔客氣⋯⋯以後政府每一個法案、財政撥款申請，我哋都會否決，呢個亦都係一個莊嚴嘅承諾」，而政府如仍不退讓，也會「義無反顧」否決預算案，並希望能促成35+「一齊否決」預算案。公民黨事後將記者會摘要於 Facebook 發布，李同意有轉發該帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 梁家傑（左）、楊岳橋（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續質疑，李於記者會上手持「議會過半 實現五大訴求」的紙牌，指記者會並非如李所說是關於選民登記。李不同意，指屬論述層面、是選民登記一部分，理解「選民登記係可以貢獻於爭取議會過半呢個目標」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方欲追問時，陳慶偉稱理解李指該些紙牌是用來吸引人做選民，李同意，並指黨推廣選民登記是想更多人支持民主派。李運騰指，尤其是想人支持公民黨？李指「可以咁講」，但會上訊息提及尊重、團結，「我理解就係有個大局觀喺度」，即取得議會過半。萬指若過半便可落實五大訴求？李稱「我哋唔知係咪真係落實到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李重申記者會訊息混合發言者有矛盾&quot;&gt;李重申記者會訊息混合、發言者有矛盾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信早前形容，記者會訊息「混合」，楊岳橋等稱否決所有撥款，但郭家麒又指預算案合理會支持。萬續質疑，據楊岳橋記者會上說法，很清楚（crystal clear）公民黨立場就是否決預算案爭取五大訴求，並非李所說的「混合訊息」。李不同意，指「有好多人講嘢」。陳慶偉追問，雖然其他人說了不同的話，但公民黨於記者會的立場還是很清楚？李運騰亦問，不同人的訊息並沒有彼此矛盾？李均不同意，認為有矛盾，但同意主題是清楚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱黨議員投票不一致理解公民黨未必兌現否決財案莊嚴承諾&quot;&gt;李稱黨議員投票不一致、理解公民黨「未必兌現」否決財案「莊嚴承諾」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，李予信曾否告知楊岳橋，若他當選後不會跟隨黨立場，否決預算案以爭取五大訴求。李指他無這樣說過，但公民黨以往也有出現「議員投票唔一致」的情況，「so far（至今為止）冇嘢可以 bound（綑綁）到所有公民黨立法會議員一致去投票」，他當時亦有此理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，但以往公民黨議員有不同投票立場時，黨有作出過「莊嚴承諾」嗎？李指不記得。陳續指，莊嚴承諾並非「口輕輕」許下、應該被兌現，否則就會令選民失去信心，因此公民黨3月許下此莊嚴承諾時，完全是打算兌現。惟李指「我理解係未必會兌現」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，公民黨以往曾許過多少「莊嚴承諾」？惟李運騰指，李予信只於2018年入黨，問題是否對他公平。李予信續在追問下，指公民黨在2018至2020年曾做過很多承諾，李運騰追問，但重要到會召記招表明作出莊嚴承諾？李再指不記得。陳慶偉亦提到，3月25日記者會上黨魁楊岳橋和黨主席梁家傑均坐在中間，問李看過多少次這樣的安排？李指二人份量較高，公民黨開記招時都是坐中間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑李過往均跟黨立場惟至控罪核心始稱不跟-李指政綱有反映&quot;&gt;官質疑李過往均跟黨立場、惟至控罪核心始稱不跟 李指政綱有反映&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指李予信是公民黨的鐵粉（die-hard fan），一直跟從黨的立場（line），那為何7月時改變？李指他入黨前一直關注公民黨，成為支部會員後很多工作、守則和政治原則上，也會參考公民黨的說法、他亦同意；但就否決預算案的立場，「其實喺嗰個 moment，我係有唔同嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指他就是要測試李，並追問若李一直跟從黨路線，為何偏偏在本案控罪的中心議題（centre issue of the charge），才有不同的做法？李解釋：「因為依個部分就直接同我想參選做立法會議員嘅初衷好有關係，而依樣嘢係我之前未 encounter（遇上）過嘅。」陳慶偉續指，若不是鄭達鴻「拍膊頭」，李不會成為區議員，又指「我不是要貶低你，不過沒有公民黨的支持，你什麼都不是（“Without the support of the Civic Party, you are simply — put it this way, I am not trying to be derogatory — nobody.”）」，李說：「可以咁樣講嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，李予信決定參選時需要黨的支持，因此要跟從黨立場，亦從沒有向公眾提及他不會跟黨否決預算案。李指他對公眾所有講法和訊息，都是根據其參選理念和原則，「無論喺公開嘅發言、單張、文宣、論壇，我嘅訊息都係一致同清晰」，但承認無公開講過，不會跟從黨立場否決預算案以爭取五大訴求。陳慶偉即說：「但你可以，不是嗎？在你新印的單張，你可以說我以選民利益優先，不論黨的立場如何。」李指「依個訊息我從來都係咁樣強調」，他未必用文字直接表達，但政綱內容有反映，均清晰談及整體社會市民利益和他特別關注的群體。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱理解黨資助有考慮其政綱若申豁免投票不獲批-仍會跟自己意向投票&quot;&gt;李稱理解黨資助有考慮其政綱、若申豁免投票不獲批 仍會跟自己意向投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻早前稱，公民黨有豁免跟隨黨立場投票的機制。李續同意，若不跟隨黨立場投票須申請豁免，未必會批准，而若不獲批，「我都會照跟自己意向投票，就即管睇吓個黨有啲乜嘢嘅後果畀我」，但承認當時沒有提過會申請。而李早前供稱黨最終願資助他40萬初選經費，法官陳仲衡問獲得該資助有否任何責任伴隨，陳慶偉亦問李會否認為自己應負一些責任，例如對黨忠誠？李指「都會有呢個理解」，但當時未有就「莊嚴承諾」的講法「有一個咁 specific 嘅關注」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前亦稱，5月底與譚文豪會面，指其所倡議政策需要錢，與黨立場或有出入。李今再指6月5日晚與選舉策略委員會會面時，譚亦是委員之一，李將曾向譚提過的政綱，即他在單張和論壇提及、一些需要爭取撥款的項目寫下予委員會，「所以佢 finance 我嘅決定，我理解其實佢有考慮過我所持有嘅政綱同想法係點樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5RrST9s.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，但前提是政府回應五大訴求、公民黨不否決預算案，李才能提出其項目，並問李有向委員會提過，會將其政綱放在黨的莊嚴承諾前嗎？李指當時無討論過，只能說理解如他所持理念和政綱能得到黨支持，「入到議會無論點都好，我都會繼續跟進」，「無論政府回唔回應（五大訴求）都好，我都會繼續去咁樣講、咁樣投票。」陳慶偉問，李予信想黨支持其政綱，那認為黨也會想他支持其政策嗎？李說「會有咁樣嘅理解」。萬德豪其後指，李從無意圖申請豁免機制，以不跟從黨否決預算案的立場，李不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱政綱或違國安法-着團隊停派並設計新單張-全棄公民黨政綱&quot;&gt;李稱政綱或違《國安法》 着團隊停派並設計新單張 全棄公民黨政綱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就李予信於初選提名表格提交的政綱，提及「爭取議會過半35+，以關鍵否決權促使政府落實『五大訴求』」，控方指是楊岳橋之前提過的「莊嚴承諾」。李指講法相若，控方可以這樣聯想，但「我嘅政綱同依個講法係矛盾嘅」。李追問下表示，當時無反對用此政綱，而他授權其他人交表，提交時知道亦同意表格附上此政綱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指《國安法》實施後，公民黨秘書處於6月30日晚或7月1日早上，為所有候選人發電郵，「一次過轉晒」所有公民黨候選人政綱為「無字政綱」，他其後獲告知此事，但無參與決定過程、不知確實由誰下決定、亦無人諮詢過他，而他理解「之前嘅政綱可能有問題，同《國安法》相違」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，李認為舊版政綱有問題？李指「我當時有咁諗過」，指《國安法》6月30日晚出爐後，他看過條文加上自己一些判斷，「我第一時間通知我嘅選舉團隊，立即停派舊嘅單張，同埋立即設計一個新嘅單張，將包含有公民黨政綱嘅內容呢，全部放棄。」李盤問下指之後沒有告訴選民他已放棄相關政綱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於 Facebook 帖文，李指3月25日記者會帖文內有選民登記網頁的連結，認為是該帖文焦點，故沒有刪除。控方質疑即使選民登記截止、《國安法》生效後李也沒有刪除，李指「因為已經沉晒底㗎喇個 post」，尤其選舉最熾熱的宣傳期曾發布很多帖文，「當時我都唔再在意啲咁舊嘅 post 喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李理解初選規則衍生自共識除目標議席不知其他協議-指是對多年協調理解&quot;&gt;李理解初選規則衍生自共識、除目標議席不知其他協議 指是對多年協調理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就提名表格提及「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」，李指他沒有出席超區協調會，亦不知黃文萱有否出席，但承認當時想知道「嗰個協調嘅共識係啲乜嘢」，「因為喺我嘅概念，初選其實就係關於協調，如果我參與初選連協調嘅共識係啲乜都唔知嘅話呢，我好難繼續參與落去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指當時無問黃文萱、也無問戴耀廷或區諾軒，但曾問秘書處總幹事歐飛，因他對每區協調、選舉策略或形勢「好有認知」，「我問佢係最快嘅。」庭上早前顯示紀錄，李曾問歐飛「我想知道超區初選既規則係點？」，獲悉超區目標議席是「3+1」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪質疑李只是問及初選的規則而非共識，李指當時理解「啲規則係衍生自呢個共識嘅，都係字眼上問題」，認為他問有什麼規則要參選的人遵守，意思就是共識。萬問共識即是協議？李認為無衝突，指有共識去遵守規則也屬「協議咗嘅情況」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，除了該些規則，李還知道初選有協議嗎？李指他不知道，強調其焦點和當時概念，就是「咁多年嚟初選嘅協調都係講緊個議席、配票嘅策略，如果就住依個目標有任何嘅協議，其實都係衍生一啲嘅規則，去約束參選人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李指不知公民黨記者會發言與初選協調共識有何關連&quot;&gt;李指不知公民黨記者會發言與初選協調共識有何關連&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前同意，曾出席3月30日公民黨「立法會選舉心戰室核心小組」會議，紀錄提及「上星期三各團隊聯合召開記招，各團隊認為成功為民主派設定選舉議程，力爭透過立法會選舉議會過半迫使政府落實五大訴求，為未來民主派繼續就選舉作出協調及合作提供基礎」，李指不記得當時是否確實用「基礎」一字。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，李看到上述提名表格條款時，有否想到在「心戰室核心小組」會議上提及，關於民主派協調的基礎？法官陳慶偉一度指問題很差勁，控方再問後李說「冇呀，太遙遠呀」，並指看到6月20日的條款時，不會想起3月會議提及的一個點，反而頗肯定他是基於向黨就初選規則追查所得到的認知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指出案情，指李當時知道的協議不止是有關議席數量，李實遠比這知道得多，李不同意。陳慶偉續指，李除了知道超區目標議席為「3+1」，亦知道公民黨參與初選的基礎，是要在立會取得過半後否決財案，這亦是「莊嚴承諾」？李不同意，指「我唔知道公民黨講嘅嘢，同埋所謂初選協調嘅共識嘅 linkage 喺邊度」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱無看過超區協調文件控方指出有看過-官質疑提問基礎&quot;&gt;李稱無看過超區協調文件、控方指出有看過 官質疑提問基礎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，不清楚提名表格條款中「民主派35+公民投票計劃」是指一份文件。萬德豪展示「35+立會過半計劃 民主派區議會（二）協調機制協議」文件，李指他無看過。萬續指，文件是由戴耀廷於5月12日以 WhatsApp 廣播發給超區參選人。法官李運騰即打斷說：「5月12日？他當時成為參選人了嗎？」萬說未，但指他是問李是否知道，李予信答他不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續向李指，他事實上曾獲發該文件，李不同意。萬再指至少李有看過該份文件，惟李運騰打斷，表示「抱歉萬先生，你有什麼證據基礎這樣說？你是代表控方，你指出案情時要有基礎」。萬指有證據公民黨有潛在候選人參選超區，李運騰指，「但坦白說，我看不到你有任何基礎指出該案情，你沒從他搜出這份文件、無法證明他在廣播名單上，你有什麼基礎？」，並再語帶無奈攤出雙手：「算了，你已問了，而他也答了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續在盤問下表示，無讀過戴耀廷於2020年4月至5月的文章，亦沒有興趣。控方一度指如李曾排鄭達鴻第二，會有興趣了解組織者的說法，惟李強調當時只是探討排鄭達鴻第二，「但係從來冇落實過」，亦不同意因此有讀過戴的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱曾看過投票宣傳片稿但無留意楊岳橋說話發布後僅確實有看過自己部分&quot;&gt;李稱曾看過投票宣傳片稿但無留意楊岳橋說話、發布後僅確實有看過自己部分&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就公民黨7月10日發布的初選投票宣傳片段，李指於6月20日拍攝前獲發一張「紙仔」要「拎住嚟背」。李早前稱拍攝前僅獲發自己講稿，不知道他人確實會說什麼，萬德豪今問李有否要求看其他人講稿，李稱「有嗰份稿」，他「唔記得好清楚」拍攝前有否讀過，「但係應該有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就片中楊岳橋承諾若特首未能落實五大訴求，公民黨將否決政府法案和預算，萬問李看到時沒有提出反對？李說沒有，「因為我焦點擺咗喺自己講嗰幾句度」、無用心留意楊會說的話，又指當時不斷要記住自己的部分，「唔想有咁多NG」，以便更快完成工作，而楊拍攝時他不在場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，片段發布前，僅曾在錄影後即時看過自己的回放（playback），他當時無表達需在發布前看全片。片段於7月10日發布，李指他有看過，但忘記有否「由頭到尾逐秒睇晒成段片」，並指據其處事手法，「我會即刻飛去睇吓自己拍成點、好唔好睇咁嘅」，故只能確實有看過自己的部分，至於楊岳橋談及否決財案的部分則不記得有否看到。控方質疑片段只長2分鐘，李指當時忙於拉票，「我十幾個鐘都喺條街度」，其餘時間也是睡覺和休息。萬再追問即李連2分鐘也懶得看？惟法官打斷指這就是李的答案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審，李予信將繼續接受盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, it briefly assesses the policy ideas and approaches in the DCPR and makes suggestions for how the Department could sharpen its thinking and approach ahead of the next major review, likely due after the next general election.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overall-assessment&quot;&gt;Overall Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We offer three headline assessments of the DCPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, because of the fiscal constraints under which it was produced, the DCPR centres on policy ideas and approaches rather than on new capabilities. The white paper contains a large number of policy ideas. But, as the chapter-by-chapter analysis below indicates, very few of them are new. We suggest that those who will be planning and leading the next major review would benefit from familiarising themselves with what has gone before, including the 2010 and 2015 white papers (and previous ones) and the defence green paper in early 2010. The DCPR arguably – even if not deliberately – serves a similar function to that green paper, setting out a broad menu of issues that will need to be considered again in the next major review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the DCPR sets out a series of worthy high-level goals but is very light on detail and contains no clear sense of prioritisation. The original Integrated Review, Defence Command Paper (DCP) and Defence and Security Industrial Strategy (DSIS) were crammed with commitments – anecdotally, they added up to more than 250 in total. The DCPR contains dozens more. We suggest that those leading the next major review should consider carefully how to prioritise the key outcomes relating to force structure, capabilities and policy and planning approaches. It would be much more useful to select a dozen or so major targets and to build robust implementation and monitoring functions to ensure that these key outcomes are being delivered effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, we observe that, despite the rhetoric, the “Integrated Review” has hardly lived up to its billing. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) was the first attempt to conduct an integrated defence and wider national security review, and even then produced two back-to-back white papers. The 2015 SDSR produced a single, integrated white paper. The 2021 exercise produced three separate white papers. In all cases, these major reviews were followed by minor ones only a few years later, as with this year’s “refreshes”. Those designing the process for the 2025 reviews should consider in advance which of these models they would prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-mods-strategic-approach&quot;&gt;The MoD’s Strategic Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new purpose for Defence proposed by the DCPR – “to protect the nation, and to help it prosper” – is clear. And the six “design principles” that will inform the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) approach – threat-led, adaptable, Allied by design, integrated, innovative and digitised – look sensible, although none are new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inverted structure of the body of the DCPR – with chapters on the key elements of the “Defence Enterprise” in Part 1 and on the more traditional policy fare of white papers in Part 2 – suits the limited ambition of this document, but would not work so well for a full-scale review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-1--securing-and-maintaining-strategic-advantage&quot;&gt;Part 1 – Securing and Maintaining Strategic Advantage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DCPR can be applauded for literally putting people first, in Chapter 1. It challenges the notion that headcount is the appropriate measure of the “size” of the UK’s armed forces and their capability – a notion that takes little account of the mechanisation of warfare and the latter-day profusion of uncrewed and lightly-crewed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter commits to “taking forward” the recommendations of the recent Haythornthwaite Review on the terms and conditions of military service. Many of these – for example, “zig zag or portfolio careers” – are not new. The key test will be how quickly the MoD implements them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major theme is skills, with a particular focus on enhancing digital skills. It is good to see the Defence Academy put at the forefront of this – and the commitment to working closely across government and with industry and academia. But the paper gives little sense of how Defence collectively and the Defence Academy in particular will drive through the skills agenda with the energy and pace required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoD civil servants will be disappointed by the single – and largely boilerplate – paragraph on the vital contribution of “our Civil Servants”. The next review should not treat the MoD’s civil service workforce as an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 follows several earlier reviews in emphasising the MoD’s intention to modernise and transform defence through science, innovation and technology. The MoD says it will increase its investment in advanced research and development and align its Science &amp;amp; Technology (S&amp;amp;T) programmes with the five critical technologies identified by the National S&amp;amp;T Council: Artificial Intelligence, Engineering Biology, Future Telecommunications, Semiconductors and Quantum Technologies. The MoD also plans to develop its capabilities in robotics, human augmentation, directed energy weapons and advanced materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Improving operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness has featured in every major post-Cold War defence review. Unless a markedly different approach is taken this time, it is difficult to see how there will be decisive change&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on lessons learned from how the Ukrainian armed forces have operated, these steps aim to accelerate the speed of operational decision-making, contribute to increased productivity in the force and improve lethality. Pound for pound, investment in these technologies collectively has the potential to increase the battlefield capability of the UK armed forces to a much greater extent than any increase in personnel numbers, although it will likely require significant re-rolling and upskilling of current personnel and the recruitment of new personnel with the skills required to operate such technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensible too is the move away from a platform-centric approach in favour of focusing on the military effects that are required, along with autonomy, digital and data-centric capabilities. It remains to be seen whether the MoD will reduce its investment in major platforms and how it will prioritise the development of these promising ideas to the extent required to really move the dial on the technology-led modernisation of the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3 covers plans to improve the Department’s performance in the acquisition of defence capabilities. Like other Western defence departments, the MoD has grappled with this challenge for decades with limited success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document declares that “….we must buy simpler platforms more quickly and design into them the capacity to upgrade at speed…” and “[we] must force ourselves to accept solutions that are good enough…” Amen – but how is this to be achieved? Open-systems architecture, spiral development, more emphasis on exportability, encouraging project leaders to remain in post for longer, and greater attention to front-end planning are all laudable, but they are not new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is new? The stress on timely delivery over perfection may not be, but it is described with greater conviction (and aligns with one of the conclusions of the recent Australian Defence Strategic Review). It would be good to hear a ringing endorsement from industry. Setting a maximum five-year commitment for acquisition programmes (three years for digital) is new, but it is not clear how this will be enabled or enforced. And, how will a thematic (as opposed to domain-centric) approach to capability development contribute to the improvements sought, and how will this work in practice? Further detail and clearer plans will be required to measure progress towards achieving these goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his annual RUSI lecture in December 2022, the Chief of the Defence Staff foreshadowed a major drive to increase the productivity of the armed forces through greater levels of lethality and readiness. We had expected to see more detail in the DCPR, but Chapter 4 does not provide this clarity. Improving operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness has featured in every major post-Cold War defence review. Unless a markedly different approach is taken this time, it is difficult to see how the DCPR will deliver decisive change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are encouraged to see that work is now underway to review the current Defence Operating Model. In our view, the recommendations of the 2011 Levene report on Defence Reform were applied in a one-sided manner. The delegation of financial authority to the Commands was not accompanied by the strengthening of the corporate framework and the Centre of the Department which Levene had envisaged – resulting in an erosion of financial discipline and a model which is ill-suited to making the defence-wide adjustments that the contemporary strategic context requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-2--operational-ambition&quot;&gt;Part 2 – Operational Ambition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to the debate over UK defence and security policy during the seven years since the Brexit referendum, perhaps the most significant phrase in the DCPR is: “… we will develop a force that is optimised to warfight in the Euro-Atlantic and in defence of our homeland”. Such clarity is overdue and very welcome – as is the focus on deterrence in Chapter 5. This paper follows the IRR in speaking of “An Integrated Approach to Deterrence and Defence”; why both documents could not have used the simpler US formula of “Integrated Deterrence” is a mystery. While the paper updates the reader on the Defence strands of deterrence, it does not adequately fill the gap we identified in the IRR: it says little about the integration of defence and civil capabilities to enhance deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On nuclear, the DCPR notes that “we have… committed to a once-in-two-generations programme of modernisation of our nuclear forces” – a decision taken many years ago which sustains the concept of nuclear deterrence we have had since the late 1990s. Like the IRR, it says little about the fundamental changes in the global strategic balance since then, not least the dramatic growth in China’s nuclear capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening message of Chapter 6 is that the MoD will “evolve” the previous DCP’s concept of “persistent engagement” to a “global campaigning approach”. We expressed some scepticism about the former in our commentary at the time – and the DCPR does not entirely still our doubts. In principle, a “campaigning approach” makes sense. But it is hard to see how Defence will “double the effect that we seek to achieve in the world” by 2030. The specific commitment to create a “Global Response Force” does not appear much different from the Joint Rapid Reaction Force announced in the Strategic Defence Review of 1998 and updated in most of the major reviews since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While it may be true that the security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions is indivisible, it is important that all concerned have a shared understanding of the limits of the military commitment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intention to continue to grow the Global Defence Network is welcome. The chapter also records the decision (taken since the previous DCP) to transfer leadership of the Network to Strategic Command – but does not explain how this will make a difference in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures to increase defence exports are sensible, although few are new. UK defence exports appear to have grown significantly during the international turbulence since the start of Russia’s war on Ukraine. But some of the longer-term trends may be less favourable, including the increasing demand from key customer states for higher levels of indigenous development and production. A more penetrating examination of this area will be required in the next review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 7 covers international relationships. One of the UK’s strengths, in contrast to its adversaries, is its extensive array of alliances and partnerships. Bringing this subject to life without descending into a long list of friendly states around the globe is a familiar editorial and diplomatic challenge. The most striking features are the resurfacing of the EU and the space given to the Five Eyes and other Indo-Pacific partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We applaud the renewed acknowledgement of the importance of the EU to UK security: “The UK will use the new momentum in the relationship to develop forms of direct cooperation, as we already intend to do through the PESCO project on military mobility”. A key task will be to ensure that the UK is not frozen out of EU capability cooperation programmes which would benefit UK Defence in the round, including the defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may be true in one sense that the security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions is indivisible, it will be important that all concerned have a shared understanding of the limits of the military commitment. The DCPR manages to tread this fine line, including by apparently stepping back from the somewhat bolder language in the March 2023 AUKUS statement on the deployment of submarines to Western Australia. Continuing to tread this line successfully in the future will be testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language on Strategic Resilience in Chapter 8 is the clearest sign yet that the MoD has fully absorbed its importance in an era of great power confrontation. We welcome the commitment to work with other government departments to implement the government’s 2022 Resilience Strategy. This will be a huge undertaking, made more challenging by the state of the economy and the public finances. The skills and capabilities of the UK’s armed forces are widely acknowledged. But the MoD will need to strike a balance between playing its full part and recognising where the lead falls to other departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis placed on the Reserves is striking. Finding a way to make service in the Voluntary Reserves more attractive, particularly to young people of all backgrounds, should be a priority. The MoD should expand on its plans to turn the ex-regular reserve forces into a “Strategic Reserve”. We have always found it odd that so little use is made of ex-regular forces for defence purposes, even though adequate incentives and the cooperation of civilian employers would be a prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where the MoD will need to elaborate publicly on its plans is the commitment to introducing an integrated air and missile defence system. Questions include how the maximum benefit will be secured from close engagement with NATO’s system, and how it will improve the dispersibility of UK forces for self-protection, given the substantial contraction in the number of airbases and other defence sites in recent decades. We wonder whether the MoD really has the bandwidth to engage effectively in the range of resilience-related activities mentioned in this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been relatively little commentary on the DCPR, likely because of the timing of its publication, but also due to its modest content. The MoD did not expect to have to update the 2021 DCP so quickly – although the history of defence planning suggests this was likely. As this article has brought out, the DCPR contains a range of worthy ideas but sparse detail on how these will be delivered, so leaves many questions unanswered. There will be important decisions on force structure, capabilities and planning approaches to be made in the 2025 review. Whether that review leads to the acceleration of plans to further modernise the UK’s armed forces and wider defence capabilities will depend on whether the incoming government decides to make further significant investment in defence. No doubt preparatory work is underway in the MoD to make the case for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0m9XZ9k.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（18日）踏入審訊第109天。前公民黨東區區議員李予信繼續作供，就他拒任鄭達鴻第二，但其後改參選超區，李解釋自己想做立法會議員，但「排第二係唔會做到」，而當時譚文豪曾問他參選意向。李指曾與譚會面，提及他所倡的政策理念或與公民黨否決所有撥款和議案的立場有出入，譚指他可繼續講其主張，李理解其言下之意是黨就否決的立場「有彈性」、他成功出線再算。李其後申請黨內「徵召機制」參選超區被拒，理解黨因他勝算不高無法全數資助其40萬初選經費。不過李於6.12一周年涉非法集結被捕後，獲告知引起黨內高層和黨員關注，並獲得捐獻，黨遂重新考慮支持他出選，李終於6月19日宣布參選，但於初選落敗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就公民黨簽署的「墨落無悔」聲明，李指與他無關，因他當時並非公民黨潛在候選人，「我冇去關心」；而他無出席過協調會議，決定參選後不知道初選規則，向黨查詢方獲告知超區「坐三望四」，理解是協調目標。李亦指，提及否決財案的選舉單張為公民黨共用，但《國安法》後無再派發亦刪去相關字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問為何改選超區-李稱想做立會議員但排第二係唔會做到&quot;&gt;被問為何改選超區 李稱想做立會議員但「排第二係唔會做到」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前公民黨東區區議員李予信今繼續作供，他昨供稱，曾拒絕參選港島的前黨友鄭達鴻提議排其名單第二，但其後報名黨內「徵召機制」參選超區。法官李運騰關注李曾告訴鄭他想專注地區工作，但兩三星期後突然又下定決心獨自參選，為何會有此心意的改變？李欲回答時，法官押至今處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李今解釋，「其實當時我可以形容我係想做立法會議員」，而與之前心態不同在於「排第二係唔會做到立法會議員嘅」。李並指，他想做立會議員是因當時或因社會政治氣氛較緊張，政府代表不太聆聽區議員意見；他亦望為被政府於抗疫基金遺忘的業界爭取撥款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱黨高層找人填補黃文萱位置-譚文豪曾問他有無意向參選&quot;&gt;李稱黨高層找人填補黃文萱位置 譚文豪曾問他有無意向參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，就時任公民黨沙田區議員黃文萱原欲參選超區但及後退出，他5月最後一星期得悉黨高層正找人填埔黃的位置，而當時譚文豪曾致電他，言下之意問他有無意向參選超區，李回答「有」，並談及一系列政策和問題想透過立法會處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指一兩日後，應在5月27至30日之間，譚相約他到其立法會議員辦事處再傾談，李指會面很短暫，他向譚指有一系列政策和理念想透過立法會選舉說出來，惟它們有機會與早前黨稱否決所有撥款和議案的主張「有出入」，「簡單啲嚟講我係要錢，而之前黨有啲講法就係反對撥款，即係唔要錢，但我選舉嘅主線將會係不斷講一啲需要錢嘅項目。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李指其政綱要錢與黨有矛盾-理解譚文豪言下之意有彈性&quot;&gt;李指其政綱「要錢」與黨有矛盾 理解譚文豪言下之意有彈性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李記得譚回應，「選超區呢最緊要嘅係知名度，而依樣嘢係我當其時欠缺嘅」，故譚建議他應好好運用他「社工區議員」及「街頭藝術舞蹈家」的兩個身分，「因為佢知道我跳咗十幾年街舞。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，就其政策和理念與黨說法有矛盾，譚無正面去解決，但譚有提及「你可以繼續講你想爭取嘅嘢」，因這些東西與其身分有很密切的關係。李理解譚言下之意，是黨就否決所有撥款和議案的立場「係有彈性嘅，亦都唔係一個已經決定咗或者係好實在嘅一個講法，係一個 undecided 嘅議題」，譚亦認為「我成功出線到初選，先至再算啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱黨因財政和勝算問題-拒絕其徵召機制申請&quot;&gt;李稱黨因財政和勝算問題 拒絕其徵召機制申請&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信同意，6月2日中午向公民黨秘事處總行政主任 Pancy Ho 發電郵，提交5個區議員名單報名參與「徵召機制」，其中一位是黃文萱。李6月5日獲確認報名，顯示他是唯一表示有意參加的公民黨區議員。李同日晚上接受公民黨選舉策略委員會的面試，展示政綱及選舉的財政預算和計劃，「因為我當其時希望黨可以資助到我，我冇咁多錢」。李解釋就超區初選和正選分別保守估計需40萬和160萬元，他當時望黨可以全額資助初選，就正選費用則可借貸、如他成功當選再分期付款歸還，但「結果係傾唔成功」，委員會告知他就初選經費，「佢哋 expect 係 grant（資助）7萬蚊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，於6月6日出席諮詢會，向黨內區議員介紹參選理念和政綱，約於6月8日再接受品格審查委員會面試。辯方大律師關文渭指會上是否問及他有否隱瞞的事及可能被對手利用的黑材料，例如有多於一個女朋友，李同意。法官陳慶偉續笑着問：「有多於一個女朋友有什麼問題？（“What’s wrong with more than one girlfriend?”）」多人發笑，陳再說：「如果他是未婚（single），有什麼問題？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，他6月9日收到時任副主席賴仁彪電話，表示經過上述3次面試，「有時黨都要作出一啲困難嘅決定」，並告知李其徵召機制申請不成功。李不記得賴解釋時的確實用字，但「最尾我哋 come up 咗係同財政關係」，理解賴言下之意是勝算和經費上，「個情況就好似一個投資嘅決定咁樣，佢覺得我開出嗰個 financial 嘅要求呢，黨滿足唔到呀。」李認為，初選的40萬資助是「最大嘅問題」，因黨僅可資助其中7萬，其餘33萬需由他向黨借貸。法官陳慶偉問，因李勝算不高，所以黨無法借33萬給他？李答：「我係咁樣理解嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱公民黨於610宣布重啟徵召機制&quot;&gt;李稱公民黨於6.10宣布重啟徵召機制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信同意，秘書處於翌日、即6月10日再向所有黨內區議員發電郵公布決定，提及徵召機制再啟動，李撤回申請，李稱「依個係佢哋嘅說法」，並重申前一日與賴仁彪通電話後，「我就知我自己唔能夠代表公民黨參加選舉。」李指他遂重整心態，「決定再做返自己區議員應該做嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉一度問及李的財政狀況，李指2019年畢業後至2020年間，主要任陳淑莊兼職助理，月入約6至7千元，亦很偶爾會有街舞表演收入；而他任區議員後月薪約3萬5千元，至2020年6月時銀行存款約有3至5萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱不知道69初選記者會與墨落無關因當時非潛在候選人&quot;&gt;李稱不知道6.9初選記者會、與「墨落」無關因當時非潛在候選人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就6月9日初選記者會，李稱當時不知道，亦不知道組織者會上說的話，因當時尚未確認黨是否接納他參選，故只是埋首關於籌備選舉的工作、是「預備埋班去選」的心態，如接納就可「去馬」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就鄒家成等人6月10日晚發起「墨落無悔」聲明，公民黨於翌日中午以黨名義簽署，李亦表示「我沒有參與黨內任何關於『墨落無悔』聲明嘅討論」，與「墨落」無任何關係。陳慶偉問，是因為李在公民黨的階級太低嗎？因他只是支部黨員。李稱是其中一個原因，而且「我當時並不是公民黨嘅潛在候選人，我冇去關心」。李亦同意，他曾於 Facebook 轉發3月25日公民黨記者會帖文，但沒有轉發黨有關「墨落無悔」的帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱612一周年被捕後獲捐獻支持-黨重新考慮派他出選超區&quot;&gt;李稱6.12一周年被捕後獲捐獻支持 黨重新考慮派他出選超區&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就李予信其後為何重新出選超區，鄭達鴻曾供稱李2020年6月12日參與街頭活動「被邀請入警署」後，黨才討論找李參選超區，因黨擔心在街頭「貢獻」不足，想被攻擊時「可以有呢樣嘢講出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信今指2020年6月12日，即6.12一周年紀念日，有北角街坊向他表示「佢啲仔女都落咗去」，而在場很多防暴警察、他很擔心，故「叫我去睇吓」。李遂去了銅鑼灣，及後被警方以非法集結罪名拘捕，李稱當晚是用區議員身分到場，惟法官李運騰打斷指不是要就該案審訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ex5meLG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年6月12日 李予信於銅鑼灣被捕（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，其後被帶到東區醫院，獲公民黨三名律師楊岳橋、梁嘉善和彭皓昕探望，他翌日獲得警署擔保。法官李運騰問李予信之後參選超區，與被捕有關嗎？李指有關係，提及是「基於警暴」；又指賴仁彪其後致電他，指李被捕後引起了一些黨內高層和黨員關注，故有一些來自他們的捐獻支持李出選超區，「所以之前呢，因為財政理由退出呢，而家黨就可以重新考慮，去解決我之前嘅財政問題，支持我出選超區」，賴並提及因有捐獻，故可達到李當初提出40萬的財政要求，意味李初選可獲得全數資助，而賴「冇多講勝算」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱不知初選規則曾向黨查詢-獲告知超區民主派坐三望四&quot;&gt;李稱不知初選規則曾向黨查詢 獲告知超區民主派「坐三望四」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，賴仁彪其後「要好從速咁 resume（重啟）返嗰個徵召機制嘅程序」，李亦要再取得15名黨內區議員支持和再辦多一次區議員大會。李指當時並不知道初選的規則，亦無出席5月13日的超區初選協調會議，而他曾於6月17日向公民黨秘書處總幹事、「大內總管」歐飛發訊息稱：「HI AUFEI，有點急…我想知道超區初選既規則係點？我係阿信」，庭上展示相關紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指當時是與賴仁彪通電話兩三日後，他正「好急咁籌備緊我要參加超區初選」，而李當時就初選規則的概念是每區均有目標議席，並要就該目標做決定。李指發訊息後，歐飛即時致電他講解初選規則的前設，指超區形勢是民主派在五席內可「坐三望四」，視乎建制派出多少張名單，而第五張名單不可報名，且投票率要夠高等。李指他曾追問「條數點計」，歐飛着他找賴仁彪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示公民黨區議員群組的紀錄，顯示6月18日賴仁彪曾發訊息提及「早前李予信議員曾表達有意參加區二立選，但由於經濟負擔問題，所以主動要求中止程序。612晚上阿信被無理拘捕事件得到極大關注，有心人得知阿信出現選舉經費問題，因而向他表達願意捐款支持鼓勵他重新考慮出選。立法會黨團及候選人即時作出討論，並支持重啟相關程序」，並重新安排於6月18日及23日舉行區議員諮詢會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李619首次公開宣布參加初選無提及否決預算案&quot;&gt;李6.19首次公開宣布參加初選、無提及否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李其後於6月19日發訊息予賴仁彪，問「我想知道更詳細取四席條數係點計」，賴遂將一份公民黨有關超區選情內部分析的簡報發給他。李同日出席公民黨於中環的初選街站，首次公開宣布參加初選，並指當時從無講過否決預算案，街站發言期間亦無人提及，但其後的問答環節有人提及。李同日於 Facebook 發文宣布參選，但同樣無提過否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱國安法前就初選投票拍片-事前僅獲發自己講稿無參與發布決定&quot;&gt;李稱《國安法》前就初選投票拍片 事前僅獲發自己講稿、無參與發布決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就公民黨7月10日在 Facebook 發布的「【7.11 7.12 初選】兩分鐘睇初選點投票」片段，楊岳橋片中承諾若特首未能落實五大訴求，公民黨將否決政府法案和預算，鄭達鴻曾稱片段講稿因《國安法》作出刪改。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李確認，公民黨秘書處職員「KAYEE」於6月19日曾發訊息給他，提到就初選投票拍片，並通知李和楊岳橋、譚文豪、鄭達鴻及郭家麒5名參選人於翌日拍攝的時間地點。李指拍攝前獲發他自己的講稿，不知道其他人確實會說什麼，但據其認知均是教人投票的內容，而當天到達時鄭達鴻剛拍攝完成。李並指由拍攝片段至發布期間，均無看過片段成品。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示第八次選舉經理會議紀錄，提及「投票片改了兩轉，預計不遲於7月2日提供 third cut，予選舉經理人提供意見」，李指他沒有出席，只有其選舉經理和代理人出席，但無印象獲告知會上情況，亦無參與片段發布的決定、沒有被諮詢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱單張提否決財案為公民黨共用國安法後無再派發並修改單張&quot;&gt;李稱單張提否決財案為公民黨共用、《國安法》後無再派發並修改單張&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續確認，於6月20日提交初選提名表格，理解當中「支持和認同戴耀廷和區諾軒主導之協調會議共識」，意思是民主派需要有個協調，並聯想到早前向歐飛和賴仁彪查詢超區協調目標，應是「坐三望四」，「咁我係認同呢個目標嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並確認，表格附有寫上「越打壓 越頑強」及他大頭照的政綱，提到公民黨將全力爭取議會過半35+，「以關鍵否決權促使政府落實『五大訴求』」。李指該政綱是公民黨「中央 share 用嘅政綱」，「我記得黨亦都提，交表嘅時候係用呢個政綱」，李當時亦無其他現成已設計好的政綱可以用。李並解釋5月底時已醞釀政綱的意念與倡議，至6月13日得悉可出選後就「同 designer 去夾」，當時是「一路設計緊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續同意，初選超區 WhatsApp 群組於6月24日建立，他是群組成員之一，但群組內無提及否決預算案。而他6月27日將設計好的單張分兩批付印，首批1,000份於6月28至29日的街站「派咗七至八成左右」，至於另外5,000份於6月30日中午才可領取，但最終他「一張都冇派到」，解釋因當時有消息指晚上《國安法》將出爐，故決定晚上「觀察住嗰個法例嘅條文，睇吓有啲咩事發生」。李最終一直保管餘下未派的單張及5,000份單張，直至被捕，亦僅就首1,000份單張、而非5,000份單張申報選舉開支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上展示該款單張，寫有「顛覆想像」，同樣提及公民黨將全力爭取議會過半35+，以關鍵否決權促使政府落實「五大訴求」。李重申該內容是其團隊「從黨公用嘅 template 攞返嚟」，並於《國安法》前設計和印刷。李續指，《國安法》後曾修改單張，無再提及以否決權促使政府回應五大訴求，並修改部分字眼，他於7月3日分批印刷共14,000份，全部派畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱初選論壇從無倡否決財案-初選落敗得票僅2&quot;&gt;李稱初選論壇從無倡否決財案 初選落敗得票僅2%&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信其後於7月4日出席初選論壇，同意論壇上從來無倡議否決預算案，而會上鄺俊宇曾問李是否願意入議會提倡社會福利政策幫助基層，李表示當然願意，又提及社福政策最大的流弊，「我覺得一筆過撥款係毀滅咗好多社工嘅夢想，係對於好多嘅社福界嘅機構、高層同前線出現矛盾，呢個係一定要喺議會入面繼續去跟進」，又指作為議員，「市民嘅福祉一定係要我哋去捍衛。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 鄺俊宇（左）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，於7月11至12日初選投票日，附在提名表格的政綱並無張貼於票站外，而是如鄭達鴻早前供述改為「無字政綱」。鄭作供時曾展示該單張，寫有「以言入罪 無字政綱 SPEECH CRIMES ARE AGAINST FREEDOM」。而李最終於初選落敗，只有2%得票，他並於7月15日記者會公開宣布不會競逐超級區議會正式選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第108天。參選超區的前公民黨東區區議員李予信今開始作供，表示2016年因協助公民黨立會競選而接觸鄭達鴻等人，並於2018年底獲鄭邀請參選北角錦屏區，遂加入公民黨成為支部黨員，並成功當選。惟李指支部黨員權力受限，不能出席會員大會及投票、不能參選執委等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就公民黨提及否決預算案的3月25日記者會，李稱獲秘書處通知出席，指是呼籲選民登記，他認為理所當然要幫手；並形容會上得到「混合嘅訊息」，一方面楊岳橋等提出否決所有撥款，但郭家麒則稱若預算案合理會支持。李並指當時「我從來冇表達過，亦都冇諗過參與該屆嘅立法會選舉」，他會上也無發言。而李會後曾出席公民黨「立法會選舉心戰室核心小組」會議，李指當時有如「新入公司嘅員工，入咗一間高層嘅房」，他僅曾就疫情議題發言一次，亦無人向他解釋過邀請他出席上述記招和會議的原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信開始作供-稱2016年獲鄭達鴻邀請代表公民黨參選區議員&quot;&gt;李予信開始作供 稱2016年獲鄭達鴻邀請代表公民黨參選區議員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選超區的李予信今開始作供，接受大律師關文渭主問。李今身穿黑色上衣、深啡色長褸和白色長褲，以基督教宣誓。李確認，1993年生於香港，2020年案發時26歲，明天將踏入30歲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yI5BOiS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李予信&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李同意，於2014年首次接觸政治，他於香港大學專業進修學院（HKU SPACE）社會科學系副學士畢業後，任街工實習生，主要關注基層和勞工權益，同年入讀中大社會學系，翌年轉讀社工學系，因「想服務香港年青人同埋基層」。而李大學於公關公司任兼職時，公司於2016年負責公民黨立法會選舉港島區競選工作，參選名單包括陳淑莊和鄭達鴻，而李獲指派與公民黨聯絡，為他與該黨的首次接觸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，該次選舉後與公民黨「冇好頻密嘅接觸，可能大時大節講一兩句恭賀嘅說話咁」，而他2018年底臨近畢業時思考畢業後的出路，得出結論是他很想做一些與社區或青年政策倡議有關的工作。李並指，當時任東區丹拿選區區議員的鄭達鴻剛好電話聯絡他，表示公民黨正就2019年區議會選舉作準備，認為當時在其選區旁的錦屏區「值得新人去嘗試」，公民黨亦正找人為康怡區的區議員接班。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 陳淑莊（右）與鄭達鴻（左）競選2016年立法會選舉港島區（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，當時鄭邀請他出席一個飯局，與會者包括時任公民黨執委陳淑莊和賴仁彪，席間他們「詳細地傾過個可能」，李最終同意以公民黨名義競逐北角錦屏區，指選擇北角主要基於其工作理念，他望為基層爭取一些資源和為舊區規劃作出一些貢獻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李加入公民黨港島支部-當選區議員後倡政府防疫基金援助被遺漏業界&quot;&gt;李加入公民黨港島支部 當選區議員後倡政府防疫基金援助被遺漏業界&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信表示，他當時尚未加入公民黨，而同意參選後第一步便加入成為公民黨香港島支部黨員，並於2018年11月27日收到確認電郵，同意電郵提到一國兩制原則。李並解釋，支部黨員為最基本成員身分，但權力有很多限制，不能出席會員大會及於會上投票、不能參選執委會成員、不能出任黨魁、司庫、秘書長等高級人員職位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，他亦成為兼職地區發展主任，指是培養地區工作者的系統，要出席基本社區工作手法、法庭知識、輔導諮詢知識等訓練，並獲公民黨實報實銷資助進行地區服務；他亦於2019年1月任時任立法會議員陳淑莊的兼職議員助理，主要從地區接收投訴轉介立法會及處理文件等支援工作。李同年5月完成大學課程，7月21日成為註冊社工：「我喺19年7.21朝頭早收到社工證。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李其後於11月當選為東區錦屏選區區議員，指他上任前民建聯蔡素玉已於該區任職逾20年，近兩屆均自動當選。而李上任後任東區區議會社會福利及安老事務委員會副主席，曾提倡支援社區創傷、失業援助金等社福政策，亦爭取糖水道天橋拆卸，及處理區內交通擠塞和衞生黑點問題。李又指，2020年初政府發放第一輪防疫抗疫基金，但當時收到一些被遺忘的行業投訴，包括藝術團體、健身中心、舞台工作者、技藝教育中心如跳舞學校和拳館等，嘗試游說政府將援助覆蓋支援他們營運。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱不知325記者會前有籌備會議-獲悉記招呼籲選民登記無需發言&quot;&gt;李稱不知3.25記者會前有籌備會議 獲悉記招呼籲選民登記、無需發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;公民黨3月25日舉行記者會，時任黨魁楊岳橋曾承諾若政府不回應五大訴求，會否決所有政府議案、撥款及預算案致特首下台。李予信確認有出席該次記者會，但對鄭達鴻早前供稱會前曾舉辦籌備會議並不知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，記者會前一日，一名公民黨秘書處女員工電話通知他出席，介紹是一個呼籲選民登記的記招，因當時選民登記將截止，有逼切性呼籲大家盡快登記。李指聽到介紹後，「我就覺得好理所當然要幫手嘅，因為我係新任嘅區議員，咁登記選民呢啲咁地區性嘅嘢，從來都係地區工作者去做」，故他很快答應出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李確認，當時公民黨有32名區議員，但不知道他被揀選出席記招的原因，稱「冇人同我解釋過個原因」。而該員工亦無詳細講誰會於記者會發言、會傳遞什麼訊息，並指他並無需於會上發言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉一度問，李於記者會前一天才突被要求出席，該記者會對他來說是完全意料之外（surprise）？李說「其實唔會好愕然嘅」，解釋黨很多時辦記招或街站等活動，也會邀請一些成員去撐場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱出席記招時從無表達亦無想過參與立法會選舉&quot;&gt;李稱出席記招時從無表達亦無想過參與立法會選舉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續確認，記者會出席者包括時任立法會議員郭家麒、楊岳橋、郭榮鏗、譚文豪、黨主席梁家傑，東區區議員鄭達鴻、沙田區議員黃文萱、油尖旺區議員余德寶，及擬參選立法會飲食界的林瑞華和大律師梁嘉善。而當時立法會議員坐前排手持「35+選民登記生成器」的紙牌；李予信和鄭達鴻等則站在後排，手持「35+議會過半，實現五大訴求」的紙牌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jZLXGxS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年3月25日 公民黨記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，出席記招時仍是公民黨支部黨員身分，解釋章程規定支部黨員要最少成為12個月才有資格成為普通黨員，且要申請才做到，而他當時無申請，但同意無規定支部黨員不可參選立法會選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就各出席者，李指黃文萱無參加初選，但其後有報名新界東正式選舉；余德寶當時無表明有意參選，「佢同我一樣都冇發言，淨係企咗喺後面」，並約於5月「公開講到明唔會參與」。他不記得梁嘉善當時是否黨員，亦不知她會否參選立法會，而梁最終無參加初選，但後被黨徵召於7月31日報名參選新界西，他不知道原因。至於李本人，他指當時「我從來冇表達過，亦都冇諗過參與該屆嘅立法會選舉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱記者會訊息混合-楊岳橋等稱否決所有撥款-郭家麒稱不會&quot;&gt;李稱記者會訊息「混合」 楊岳橋等稱否決所有撥款 郭家麒稱不會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，當時從記者會得到一個「混合嘅訊息」，一方面清晰聽到楊岳橋、郭榮鏗、譚文豪3人提到反對所有法案、議案和撥款，要政府回應五大訴求，並提到《基本法》就否決預算案後安排的規定。但另一方面郭家麒發言時「好強調財政預算案嘅合理性」，舉例「如果撥款係胡亂畀警察嘅開支嘅話呢、如果唔合理的話呢，咁議員係有責任否決」；但「如果預算案係合理、得到市民支持嘅話呢，無論選到35席40席呢，其實都會支持」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0cm3fqs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 郭家麒（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦指，林瑞華當時發言「有一個位好觸動到我」，指林提及「政府啱啱提出一個荒謬嘅禁酒令」，而李正幫助的被遺忘的業界也受政府停業令影響，故很明白林所說的「業界利益」。李續指，總括而言他會上聽到一些關於否決所有撥款的說法，但似乎郭家麒又不會否決所有撥款的說法，而林瑞華則爭取業界支持，故形容當時記者會訊息「混合」，「但有一個一致嘅訊息就係，要政府聆聽民意同埋選民登記」。李並同意，他在黨內年資很淺，會上無反對楊岳橋等人說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱獲邀出席心戰室核心小組會議-理解與選民登記及樁腳有關&quot;&gt;李稱獲邀出席「心戰室核心小組」會議 理解與選民登記及「樁腳」有關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信續表示，記者會後，被秘書處職員邀請出席3月30日的「立法會選舉心戰室核心小組」第三次會議，除鄭達鴻和梁家傑外，曾出席記者會的人士均有參與，亦有其他區議員。被問會議目的，李指大意是記者會後「可能有啲嘅檢討同埋有啲嘅工作」，而因有些工作應與他有關，故答應出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示會議紀錄，李表示於事後看過「心戰室核心小組」的名字，理解是關於立法會選舉籌備的討論、或一些論述思考上的會議，但當時他理解「係同我距離有啲遠嘅，因為我只係一個上任3個月嘅區議員」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，李知道他為何被邀請出席嗎？李指有兩個理解，首先他出席了3月25日記者會，記得楊岳橋有提及他身後有一些新的區議員，「佢哋係可以幫大家做選民登記」；其次是在傳統立法會選舉，區議員有機會做「樁腳」的角色，需在選舉時做一些地區上的支持，「呢兩個就係我當其時諗到我自己嘅身分同立法會選舉有關係嘅地方。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱會議如新入職員工進入高層房-僅發言一次&quot;&gt;李稱會議如新入職員工進入高層房 僅發言一次&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就紀錄提及「與會者同意，現階段公民黨可透過發表文章，進一步闡述星期三記招的論述」，並提及由黃文萱發表文章。李解釋當時輿論不斷講議會價值、亦有非建制派政治人物提過「議會係冇用」，故會上應有探討如何將議會價值透過文章彰顯出來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/t38fIqX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭續指，參與者發言均會被記錄，但看不到李發言的紀錄。法官陳仲衡指「與會者同意」一句，李會是其中一個同意的人。李續解釋，「其實嗰一日嘅會議呢，我可以形容為好似一個新入公司嘅員工，入咗一間高層嘅房⋯⋯咁呢間房入面就有啲立法會議員講緊啲立法會層次上嘅大事啦，咁我當其時其實就真係坐喺度㗎啫，咁我記得我唯一一個發言嘅時候呢，就係喺後面嘅」，而就「與會者同意」的部分，他印象中無任何決議過程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，但李予信同意應再發文闡述立場？李指當時理解每個記招後都會有文章解釋黨的發言和論述，認為「係一個好平常嘅工作」，亦無任何異議，但當時無跟進、不清楚黃文萱有否撰文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱不知道屬哪個團隊&quot;&gt;李稱不知道屬哪個團隊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡關注紀錄亦提到「各團隊」，李指理解是不同立法會選區候選人的工作團隊。陳問李屬於那隊？李說：「我唔知道我係邊個團隊。」李運騰續指李是東區區議員，看來屬於港島團隊，李表示「其實呢個團隊冇一個好官方嘅認證，你係咪一個團隊嘅意思」，又指他有機會是港島區的「樁腳」，但在會議紀錄的文字上「我唔清楚佢係咪 regard 我 as 嗰個團隊嘅一員」。李並指，不知道會議紀錄是草稿抑或正式紀錄，同意紀錄從鄭達鴻辦公室檢取。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱會議與選民登記有關喚起關注選舉-官稱有保留&quot;&gt;李稱會議與選民登記有關、喚起關注選舉 官稱有保留&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續引紀錄指，會議是「心戰室核心小組」的第三次會議，李予信此前一定有參與多過一次會議。李不同意，指該會議是他第一次參與，他前兩次無出席；而他是出席會議時才知道他成為了該小組的一員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續問，李指楊岳橋曾稱區議員可幫助選民登記，而他們獲邀出席會議的目的就是幫助選民登記，但會議紀錄卻完全無提過？李指會議紀錄上無，但「口頭上應該有講」，紀錄「未百分百準確」；而他不記得事前有否收過會議議程，但「我理解其實呢個會入面所有嘅討論，都係同選民登記有關係」，因「選民唔會無啦啦走嚟登記」，而是需要一些論述和解釋；又指每區關注議題也有出入，故理解會議存在意義是討論有什麼重點論述可在地區層面解釋給街坊聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，故會議並不是關於選民登記的流程，而是關於更高層面的事？李同意，認為是「喚起關注選舉」的工作層面。陳慶偉指能理解李稱會上討論是為了吸引選民投票支持公民黨，但若李稱該些討論是為了選民登記，他則有保留，並主動稱相信大家均有在街上被人問「先生，登記咗做選民未呀？」的經驗，陳志全、林卓廷等發笑。陳續提高聲線指，「而你不會說『我們想要這、想要那，入到議會我們會做這、做那』，不！我只會給你5秒鐘時間！然後我就會走開。」陳仲衡亦指，李不會告訴選民有關會上討論的「國際戰線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續解釋，在傳統政黨的工作，「我哋會視肯畀我哋吸引登記做選民嘅市民呢，其實好有機會喺將來嘅選舉投返畀我哋。」陳慶偉即高聲說：「為什麼？如果你來問『先生你登記咗未，我依家同你登記』，你怎知道我會投票給你？」李續指據其地區工作經驗，如擺街站幫人登記做選民，區內就會說「阿信幫人登記緊做選民喎」，形容是讓選民知道他在服務選民的其中一個工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱無人解釋邀他出席記招或心戰室會議原因&quot;&gt;李稱無人解釋邀他出席記招或心戰室會議原因&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指假設李所言正確，但這是一個由黨魁主持、有立法會議員和部分區議員出席的高層次會議，關於如何喚起市民關注並幫助黨於立法會選舉的選情，而在公民黨三十多名區議員中，為何會叫作為新人的李予信出席此會議？李說：「冇人去好詳細解釋過點解我喺記招或者呢個 meeting 嘅原因。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱會上唯一就疫情影響發言郭家麒曾關注否決財案會否阻礙振興經濟&quot;&gt;李稱會上唯一就疫情影響發言、郭家麒曾關注否決財案會否阻礙振興經濟&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信其後補充，登記選民時會向市民點出社會問題如疫情，並闡述議會可幫助解決，有部分是會議上提過的內容。李又指會上唯一一次發言，就是討論到關於疫情後的經濟復蘇時，立法會議員問到地區上有否關於疫情影響的聲音，他遂舉手說有，並提及有接觸被防疫基金「遺忘」的業界代表，有相約他們去立法會開會，將有行動向政府爭取援助。法官李運騰再質疑與選民登記有何關係，李稱與登記流程關連不大，但與論述層面有很密切關連，同意是爭取社會對黨的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李欲再解釋時，法官陳慶偉打斷問及相關性，李運騰亦指認為辯方意圖顯示被告曾提出需政府支持的方案，他想與政府合作而非反政府，指法庭已理解。李亦確認，郭家麒會上曾提及，「民主派否決預算案迫政府落實五大訴求的策略，會否阻礙振興經濟的措施，建議要求政府將警察的撥款用作救市，以爭取市民支持」，亦吻合他在記招說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱無收過心戰室核心小組會議紀錄&quot;&gt;李稱無收過「心戰室核心小組」會議紀錄&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後再質疑，會議紀錄提到設計選舉文宣、開設選舉經理群組等事項，問李予信是否同意選民登記是會上次要關注，首要關注是公民黨如何於立法會爭取更多議席？李不同意，指選民登記與立法會得票和策略上的考量其實並非互相排斥，「喺思緒上係要統一咁去考量。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，會後無收過這份會議紀錄，他是被捕後開審才在審訊文件夾看到；又指之後有去過多於一次「心戰室核心小組」會議，但「依一刻事隔三年之後，我的確係唔記得咗」。李又指，就所有會議均從無收過會議紀錄，理解紀錄「唔係畀我哋睇」，是供秘書處職員存檔及執行，像他這種參與者「記得有咩要做就自己去做」，如就介紹選民登記的原因和論述「用個腦記住就得喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第108天。李予信繼續作供，表示參選港島的前黨友、同案被告鄭達鴻，曾於2020年4至5月問他「（港島名單）排佢第二好唔好」，二人曾探討該可能性；惟李認為自己剛任區議員，忙於處理地區工作，如還要頻密落區派傳單，難以發揮其工作理念關注的議題，終在5月中向鄭表示不想做第二，並退出其選舉預備工作。李續指，其後前黨友黃文萱決定不參選超級區議會，他並於6月初報名黨內「徵召機制」參選超區。法官關注，李曾告訴鄭達鴻自己想專注地區工作，但兩至三星期後突然又下定決心獨自參選，為何會有此心意的改變？李欲回答時，法官打斷問答案是否很長，辯方確認，法官遂押至明早處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信稱曾探討正式選舉排鄭達鴻名單第二的可能-但無協議&quot;&gt;李予信稱曾探討正式選舉排鄭達鴻名單第二的可能 但無協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選超區的前公民黨東區區議員李予信繼續作供，李的前黨友、鄭達鴻早前曾稱，李予信於3月至5月時原排其港島名單第二。李予信今指，二人「冇一個協議，只係一個可能性嘅探討」，該討論應於4至5月中進行，「有一次鄭達鴻同我講過，排佢第二好唔好。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0ccfVTV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄭達鴻（左）、李予信（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注李是於初選抑或正式選舉排鄭達鴻名單第二，李指他當時知道公民黨會參加初選，但鄭問他時無指明是初選還是正式選舉，「我淨係得悉到排第二就係9月嗰個（正式）選舉係排第二，我冇深究過關於初選嘅事情」，理解鄭是談及正式選舉。陳仲衡指，但要參與正式選舉，二人都要參加初選？李指當時是這樣猜測，「但係實質上冇人同我傾過關於初選嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，最終於5月中，「我係冇同意做佢嘅第二」，不過該討論無向公眾公布，只有公民黨內部得知，他不清楚當時黨高層如何看，亦無從得知他們有否被通知，但當時猜測可能會有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;公民黨5月特別會員大會通過出選名單-鄭達鴻無安排名單第二&quot;&gt;公民黨5月特別會員大會通過出選名單 鄭達鴻無安排名單第二&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信同意，5月30日公民黨召開特別會員大會，他以無投票權的支部黨員身分列席。辯方展示會議紀錄，李確認有收過，會上楊岳橋宣布原有意參選超區的黃文萱決定退出，最終通過6張出選名單，其中鄭達鴻出選港島區，但沒有安排名單第二的人選，至於梁嘉善則排新東第二位，與李今早稱終報名參選新西不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/x2hxbFI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
▲ 梁嘉善（左）、黃文萱（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;紀錄亦顯示，會上授權執委會在無法召開特別會員大會時，決定候選人最後出選名單，主席梁家傑並匯報公民黨已參與了35+計劃，並指2019年12月成立的選舉策略委員會，會繼續尋找參選超區和替補的Plan B候選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱因剛上任忙地區工作遂不排鄭達鴻第二-惟與黃文萱不選超區無關係&quot;&gt;李稱因剛上任忙地區工作遂不排鄭達鴻第二 惟與黃文萱不選超區無關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黃文萱不再參選超區，李予信指於5月最後一個星期，已從公民黨立法會議助聽到「阿萱唔選喇」。李運騰問，而李不屬於公民黨高層人員的圈子？李說：「係，我唔屬於嗰個圈，因為我只係支部嘅會員」，同意高層會比他更早知道該消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，李予信不做鄭達鴻的名單第二，與黃文萱退選超區有關係嗎？李表示沒有關係，「但係又有啲時間上嘅巧合，都影響咗我之後嘅少少決定」，解釋5月中時曾向鄭達鴻表示「其實我就想唔做第二」，因他剛上任要處理很多地區和抗疫支援工作，很忙碌，而當時只有他與全職助理兩人，「其實都好吃力，如果我仲要好頻密做一啲落區派傳單嘅工作呢，其實我覺得喺工作理念上，唔係好發揮得到我當時關注嘅議題」，因此向鄭交代後，「我就退出咗佢個團隊喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，李予信說退出團隊，即曾經加入？李指「團隊」並非「一個好official嘅認證」，指鄭有一個一起工作的選舉群組，「如果我探討緊參選可能嘅時候，都會接觸到嗰個團體」，而他最後是退出鄭的「選舉預備工作」，至5月尾就有議助傳出黃文萱不再選超區的消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李確認終循徵召機制報名超區-官問為何有心意改變&quot;&gt;李確認終循「徵召機制」報名超區 官問為何有心意改變&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示由公民黨秘事處總行政幹事於5月31日，向所有公民黨區議員發出題為「2020年立法會換屆選舉啟動徵召機制」的電郵，邀請他們參選超級區議會，並指有意參加者須於6月2日下午3時前收集5名區議員的支持，其後要接受面試並出席諮詢會，向所有黨內區議員介紹政綱和宣言，並要於6月9日前提交15個區議員的書面支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指他有回覆表示有意參選，於6月2日提交一個5名區議員的名單，表示有興趣參與該「徵召機制」，並於3日後獲回覆確認收到報名。法官李運騰問，李予信於兩日內要找5人支持，時間很緊迫，而他其後要再找多至少10人支持，且全部須為區議員？李予信一一同意。李予信續同意他是「好新」的黨員，李運騰問，那獲得15人支持是否容易？李予信說「都要花啲時間」。李運騰再問，而這需要他的一些決心？李予信回應：「都可以咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問：「你兩三星期前才告訴鄭達鴻你想專注地區工作，但兩三星期後突然又下定決心參選，而且還是獨自參選，為何會有這個心意的改變（change of heart）？」李說：「我可以解釋，正如……」，惟法官陳慶偉打斷問是否很長，關文渭笑言非常長。法官遂將案件押至明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 12 August, the G20’s Anti-Corruption Ministerial Meeting convened for the last time under the current Indian presidency. Unsurprisingly, asset recovery was a key area of focus for the G20 participants. Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to making the recovery and return of proceeds of crime a key policy objective – both at the domestic level by enforcing effective legal powers, tools and measures, and at the international level via effective coordination and communication, and timely execution of cross-jurisdictional asset recovery requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to say that asset recovery has been a hot topic in the world of financial crime over the last year. From Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, which led many G20 countries to step up their response to the proceeds of crime, to the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) increased interest in the topic, organisations and governments across the world have committed to increasing their efforts to recover stolen assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there are multiple reasons why policymakers should be paying more attention not only to catching criminals, but also to recovering the assets they’ve stolen. Recovering assets from criminals is an effective deterrent, underlying the principle that crime does not – or should not – pay. For countries that have been decimated by corrupt politicians, recovered assets can be reinvested in education, infrastructure and other projects, increasing public trust and strengthening the rule of law and democratic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G20 has a crucial role to play in global asset recovery efforts, not least as G20 countries are very often the destination of choice for plundered assets. The lack – or inefficacy – of asset recovery and return mechanisms has a devastating impact on the economies of the countries from which the assets are originally stolen: it halts growth, increases inequalities and corrupts democratic processes. There is, therefore, a moral imperative for G20 countries to boost their efforts in relation to asset recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-g20s-approach-to-asset-recovery&quot;&gt;The G20’s Approach to Asset Recovery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopes were high when India was placed at the helm of the G20. The country had previously argued for the inclusion of asset recovery in the G20’s anti-corruption commitments in 2018. Under the Indian presidency, “strengthening asset recovery mechanisms related to corruption” has been identified as one of the priority areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This commitment is echoed at the global level by the FATF’s approach to enhancing global asset recovery mechanisms. Last year, the FATF and Interpol announced an initiative to upscale the global response to asset recovery and “to deprive criminals of their dirty money”. This includes revising the FATF’s Recommendations 4 and 38, a long overdue action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite some improvement over the last 15 years, it is clear that current international asset recovery mechanisms are still not good enough&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time, however, that asset recovery has been a focus of the G20. In 2011, the G20 adopted nine principles on asset recovery. Inter alia, the principles require countries to make asset recovery a policy priority, implement legislation to support the application of global anti-money laundering standards, establish a wide range of legislative options for asset recovery, and adopt laws that facilitate international cooperation. Under the Indian presidency, resources have been collated from a small number of G20 countries (currently Canada, Mexico, Turkey and India) to provide step-by-step guides to asset tracing, requesting mutual legal assistance and asset recovery in each jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, G20 countries have been engaged in many initiatives to improve global asset recovery mechanisms, focused in particular on the sharing of information and expertise. For example, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil are members of the GAFILAT Asset Recovery Network which was established in 2009 to facilitate the identification, tracing and recovery of criminal proceeds. Data shows an increased number of consultations since the network’s inception, especially in relation to drug-trafficking offences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these actions are commendable. However, despite some improvement over the last 15 years, it is clear that current international asset recovery mechanisms are still not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-the-current-state-of-asset-recovery-in-the-g20&quot;&gt;Assessing the Current State of Asset Recovery in the G20&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While asset recovery is undeniably a key area of focus for G20 countries, at the national level the results still leave much to be desired. The latest FATF Mutual Evaluation Reports (MER) for some G20 countries provide a mixed picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa, for example, has a moderate effectiveness rating on issues related to asset confiscation. The authorities have managed to demonstrate positive results in the recovery of proceeds of crime, particularly in the areas of fraud and economic crime. However, wider efforts on recovering assets from state capture and proceeds moved to other countries have been less successful and have only been undertaken more recently. Following its mutual evaluation, South Africa was grey-listed by the FATF; as part of its action plan, it has to address issues around enhancing the identification, seizure and confiscation of proceeds and instrumentalities of a wider range of crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Indonesia has also achieved a moderate level of effectiveness on asset confiscation according to the FATF. One of the key elements of the country’s anti-financial crime strategy is optimising asset recovery, and while the authorities do pursue illicit assets laundered abroad, the amounts effectively recovered transnationally are low. The most recent Mutual Evaluation Report shows the assets that have been repatriated to victims in cash, which amounted to only €4.75 million from 2017 to early 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While new laws to boost recovery are welcome, what is needed from Global North countries is operational capacity and a willingness to engage with “victim” countries in the Global South&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the European level, MONEYVAL, the Council of Europe’s anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing body, warned in its annual report for 2022 that the recovery of proceeds of crime against states is insufficient. According to its chair, Elżbieta Frankow-Jaśkiewicz, there is an “urgent need for [European countries] to greatly improve their results in confiscating and managing criminal assets, adopt stricter sanctions and increase the number of convictions for serious money laundering offences”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are signs that some G20 members are listening to calls for better international cooperation and providing increased assistance to developing countries. In November 2022, France introduced a mechanism aimed at returning the proceeds of the sale of illicit assets that have been confiscated in the country. The law enables the state of origin to make requests for mutual legal assistance for the return of assets. States can now bring an action before French courts to seek redress and have rights of ownership – this can be done via the opening of an independent investigation in France or by starting civil proceedings. While new laws to boost recovery are welcome, however, what is needed from Global North countries is operational capacity and a willingness to engage with “victim” countries in the Global South. This is currently one of the main weaknesses of G20 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exception, Italy, has been regarded by many as a “beacon” for asset recovery efforts. Italians understood quite early on that mafia members could still operate from inside prison walls. What really hurt them was taking their assets. The country is now one of the leaders in the recovery of assets globally and has created dedicated asset recovery liaisons in relevant host countries. Early this year, the country’s Guardia di Finanza also hosted a Learning and Development Forum on behalf of the FATF to share best practices and “make a difference in the fight against financial crime”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-more-do-g20-countries-need-to-do&quot;&gt;What More Do G20 Countries Need to Do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was argued in a previous commentary on G7 commitments that stale thinking and paraphrased commitments were the main threat to the group’s efficacy in the fight against illicit finance. The same can be said about the commitments made by the G20. There are clearly pockets of good practice across the G20, and G20 countries are rightly promising higher international standards. But, as ever, these promises need to be followed by concrete action, particularly when it comes to areas where the G20 should excel, like information sharing and international collaboration. The step-by-step guides referenced above are a case in point; so far, only four G20 countries have contributed, but these could prove to be an invaluable resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As India’s presidency of the G20 comes to a close, its successor, Brazil, should continue to prioritise asset recovery and – in particular – the G20’s commitments around improved international collaboration and coordination. The last Ministerial Meeting noted the countries’ commitment to update their information on existing guides to international cooperation requests, which is a promising start. If asset recovery remains a priority for the G20 – and if G20 countries can deliver on their commitments – the fight against corruption might stand a chance of seeing some much-needed improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（16日）踏入審訊第107天。柯耀林選舉經理陳展浚今接受控方盤問，表示因柯耀林票源與范國威重疊，故望與對方「鬥快」簽署「墨落」，但柯簽署時「連鄒家成係邊個都唔識」，亦無與「抗爭派」聯繫的想法；而柯初選論壇稱會兌現初選簽署的「協議書」，只是指「贏咗有得選，輸咗冇得選」。陳又指《國安法》後曾審視文宣內容並更小心用字，但無再審視「墨落」和移除帖文，因認為《國安法》不會追究7月1日前的事。此外，控方高級檢控官陳穎琛今盤問時，多番被法官質疑盤問方式，指其提問重複、毫無用處，着她善用法庭時間，法官陳慶偉更一度指「這是一條很差的問題」。陳展浚今完成3日作供，新東案情完結，參選超區的李予信明將開始作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱柯出席協調會前無通知組織者-控方引戴訊息質疑&quot;&gt;陳稱柯出席協調會前無通知組織者 控方引戴訊息質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林前助理、選舉經理陳展浚昨完成主問，今接受控方高級檢控官陳穎琛盤問。陳同意與柯認識十年，被柯邀請作證，自視與柯關係緊密，關心柯亦想幫他。就首次新東協調會議，陳稱柯由區鎮樺通知時間地點，據他所知柯無通知組織者會出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示趙家賢與戴耀廷的 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示戴發出的出席者名單包括柯耀林。陳指不清楚戴為何知道柯會出席，陳慶偉問故他稱柯無通知組織者是「揣測」？陳重申以他所知柯沒有告知組織者，「我相信如果有呢件事，佢會同我講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳引柯稱會上提初選目的為五大訴求因爭拗嘥時間提早離場&quot;&gt;陳引柯稱會上提初選目的為五大訴求、因爭拗「嘥時間」提早離場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳展浚昨稱柯當晚提早離開會議並致電他，陳今指柯於8時半致電他，指已得悉初選程序，包括新東初選如何進行，及目標議席「6+1」等3點共識，但無提替補機制；柯並指當時有人應因「恩怨」問題爭執，但因距離遠而「唔係太聽得清楚」，他「唔知道嗰啲人拗緊乜嘢」、「覺得好嘥時間」，故離開會議，有份爭執的包括將軍澳青年力量陳緯烈，陳同意與柯所屬的將軍澳民生關注組是敵對關係（rival）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lMwEqVE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳展浚&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦指，柯稱會議提及初選其中一個目的是爭取五大訴求，「但冇講過係由邊個講」，據陳所知柯當天於會議亦沒有發言。柯也無提到戴稱會就「共同綱領」討論、能同意的事項會變成文件讓大家簽署，及有與會者提及戴的「攬炒」文章。而陳其後從有出席的區鎮樺，確認當天餘下會議都是爭執，但區沒告知他內容，他亦無問。控方問陳沒興趣知道？陳說「冇回應」，追問下稱他想知但應忘記問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱柯初選前認識區諾軒戴耀廷-惟無儲存戴電話&quot;&gt;陳稱柯初選前認識區諾軒戴耀廷 惟無儲存戴電話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，柯告知他「民主動力」是會議的主持，但無提過區諾軒。陳確認區是前民主黨員，他和柯於初選前均認識區和有其電話；而柯亦認識戴耀廷，但無將其電話儲存，解釋戴處理票站時曾 WhatsApp 柯，柯向陳展示電話，清晰顯示為電話號碼、無儲存為聯絡人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示從趙家賢手機擷取的新東 WhatsApp 群組紀錄，顯示於6月24日由戴耀廷創立，柯是群組成員。陳慶偉指，明顯地表面看來，戴於柯仍是民主黨成員時就有其電話號碼，因紀錄顯示戴將其電話儲存為「Ricky Or (DPHK)」。陳說不一定，但在法官追問下答「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟辯方大律師唐樂山指出，上述紀錄是從趙家賢手機擷取，故是趙儲存柯的電話為「DPHK」，不是戴耀廷。陳慶偉指明顯該紀錄是從趙擷取，但群組是由戴耀廷創立。唐重申電話是由趙儲存，指戴不會將自己命名為「戴耀廷教授（HKU）」，林卓廷大笑，楊雪盈等亦發笑。陳慶偉一度手指向屏幕重申，但群組是由戴創立；李運騰則指紀錄顯示的聯絡人或反映趙而非戴手機，並與陳耳語片刻，陳續說：「好，繼續。（“Right, carry on.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑選舉涉大量金錢-陳卻無派人出席第二次會議&quot;&gt;官質疑選舉涉大量金錢 陳卻無派人出席第二次會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第二次會議，陳展浚指柯耀林核心團隊大約有12至13人，少數為義工，但柯無派任何代表出席，陳亦沒有安排，解釋當日進行區議會大會，最後三小時大部分動議均由他們提出，而團隊大部分人為西貢區議員，無人手出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉質疑，據早前證供，柯在初選和正式立法會選舉要花共至少180萬，「但你卻沒派任何人出席第二次會議。」陳重申當天的確無人手，而大埔團隊區鎮樺亦同因大埔區議會超時無出席，「我都冇辦法。」陳慶偉再指，但180萬對組織鬆散的區政聯盟而言是很大金額？陳同意，「所以好大機會都係由候選人自己出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指據他所知無第三次新東會議。控方問那他是否從無聽過柯耀林投訴，沒有從組織者收到文件？陳答：「係，但係點解要投訴？」陳慶偉指因組織者處事草率鬆散，「你看，你要花180至250萬在一些沒有白紙黑字紀錄的事上！什麼都沒有（nothing）！」陳稱：「但過去選舉協調嘅情況都係差唔多。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱柯耀林無看戴耀廷和區諾軒文章的習慣和興趣&quot;&gt;陳稱柯耀林無看戴耀廷和區諾軒文章的習慣和興趣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳同意，他被指派告知柯耀林最新的政治發展，亦有閱讀有關初選的文章。控方續展示戴耀廷於《蘋果日報》發布的〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉、〈攬炒的定義和時間〉及〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉，陳均稱無看過，指他有閱讀《蘋果日報》的習慣，但「專欄比較少睇」、對「蘋果論壇」無甚印象，又指當時不關注由35+組織者發布的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦指他甚少看戴的 Facebook，近年較少看區諾軒文章，他與區關係「一般普通、冇乜特別」；至於柯耀林有否看戴耀廷 Facebook 和區諾軒文章，陳說：「我淨係知佢冇呢個習慣同興趣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aqjrskt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就柯6月討論「墨落」時曾於區政聯盟「2R戰略討論處」群組說：「呢份嘢講到明會否決財政預算案，戴教授而家都唔講啦」，陳昨稱柯當時感覺戴無再寫文章提及否決預算案。控方質疑即柯有看過戴文章，陳重申柯無看、亦無此習慣和興趣，「總之個講法就係唔覺得新聞再有、或者再有呢啲嘅議題提及過」，「總之係佢有個印象就係唔覺得戴耀廷仲有，冇補充。」陳其後同意法官指，該訊息表面看來柯知道戴以往說過什麼，並指他自己也知道戴以往說過的話，指是來自新聞一般觀察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;群組紀錄顯示，柯亦曾發布《蘋果日報》連結，標題為〈【李八方online】素人反枱 民主派初選會拉倒？〉，控方問柯是否主動找初選相關新聞。陳指他「無從判斷」，亦無印象有否打開該連結。李運騰問陳的上司發出連結，有沒有問他為何這樣做？陳笑道：「其實呢件事好小事嚟嘅，每一件事問我開唔開 link 真係冇可能記得。」李再說但這是有關初選，而陳是柯的選舉經理，陳即說：「我諗唔到呢條問題有咩嘢關係」，林卓廷聞言大笑，李運騰說：「可能有人會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳認為無需再了解69記者會&quot;&gt;陳認為無需再了解6.9記者會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就初選記者會，陳表示事前不知道3月26日的記者會，事後「好似喺新聞睇過」，但無告知柯，他在柯出席首次協調會議前亦無任何準備。至於6月9日記者會，陳指有團隊成員將相關訊息轉發至群組，就是他知道的所有詳情。李運騰再問陳作為選舉經理，沒有嘗試再了解記者會發生的事？陳指覺得無此需要，亦認為訊息已如實反映初選如何進行，無需要再向柯作補充。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱與范國威票源重疊望鬥快簽墨落&quot;&gt;陳稱與范國威票源重疊望鬥快簽「墨落」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落無悔」聲明，陳展浚指當時認為鄒家成是發起人，亦知他是新東潛在參選人，他曾透過 Facebook 私訊鄒，問如何加入該聯署及表示有興趣，獲回覆「OK」，但記不起具體時間，亦不能確定是在柯確認簽署前或後。陳亦同意，當時鄒無答他如何加入聯署，他也沒再問，無法肯定是否成功為柯加入聯署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，似乎其團隊想比范國威和梁國雄更早簽署，因有人於群組提及「最緊要早過饅頭雄同范國威」。陳回應因看到越來越多人簽，「所以先有想同范生鬥快呢個情況」，但指「我從來都冇諗住同阿梁國雄鬥快，個別人有個別意見，我冇辦法代表佢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問為何陳想比范國威更早簽署，陳稱范也是將軍澳民生關注組創辦人，基本上與他們票源重疊，票源上是其中一個主要對手。陳慶偉追問，即比范更早簽署，會令其選民轉為支持柯？陳指「我又唔覺得一個聲明嘅威力可以大到咁，只不過係個行為上面可能係快過佢，純粹係一個比較」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ccCLNmw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 范國威（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後問，團隊當時唯一的考慮，就是要比范國威更快簽署？陳同意，但在李追問下改稱「快過范國威簽係我哋其中一個主要嘅考慮」，而「唔係唯一」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱柯耀林連鄒家成係邊個都唔識無與抗爭派聯繫的想法&quot;&gt;陳稱柯耀林「連鄒家成係邊個都唔識」、無與抗爭派聯繫的想法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦表示，當時無向組織者查詢該聲明。控方指他不想知道聲明如何出現？陳指「我唔係唔想」，但似乎無充足時間讓他考慮。陳亦指柯耀林無叫他找更多關於聲明的資料，「佢連鄒家成係邊個都唔識」，並同意柯曾問他誰是鄒家成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳並同意，當時為帖文製作圖片，寫有「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭 抗爭派立場聲明書」。陳慶偉問將柯與「抗爭派」聯繫是誰的想法，陳說他們無此想法，又指「呢個只不過係聯署帖文嗰張圖，請問法官閣下個關係喺邊度？」。陳其後同意，在「墨落」加名並不會顯示柯與抗爭派有聯繫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱墨落提否決權非共識-官追問下認不知道&quot;&gt;陳稱「墨落」提否決權非共識 官追問下認不知道&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問，陳展浚是否同意「墨落」兩點聲明是協調會議共識，惟法官李運騰指控方是在問陳對聲明的意見，指陳無出席會議，「他對聲明的理解不會比我們更好（just as good as ours）。」陳重申有建議柯耀林簽聲明，而他只集中於「墨落」上的兩點聲明，認為其他內容不重要，他亦無法判斷柯有否閱讀全文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續引柯 WhatsApp 提到：「暫不需理會，靜觀其變，呢份嘢可能成為DQ理據，我未正式宣布參選，有時間」，問陳是否同意柯當時看過聲明並有自己意見。陳重申「無從判斷佢係咪完全睇晒」，李運騰說沒關係，這是由法庭決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳盤問下重申，認為「墨落」第一點聲明除認同五大訴求外，其餘均非協調會議達成的共識。李運騰追問柯耀林於首次會議早走，如何得知不是共識，陳指該三點共識是柯認知協調會達成共識的一切，「就係咁多，冇補充」。李再重複問題，陳說：「我唔明你問題，定係翻譯出咗問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李稱問題很簡單，就是柯提早離開，怎知共識不是在他離開後達成？陳說：「我頭先已經講過，我哋根據我哋認知達成嘅共識就係嗰三點，我冇補充」，後同意即是他不知道。控方欲再追問，惟李運騰指問題重複，並笑說「而他會說他沒有補充」，陳志全和林卓廷等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑無向柯講述對墨落非強制否決的理解-陳不同意&quot;&gt;控方質疑無向柯講述對「墨落」非強制否決的理解 陳不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就陳昨稱，理解「墨落」中運用否決權一點無強制須否決預算案，他今確認於決定簽署「墨落」當晚、與柯耀林3至4分鐘的通話中，有與柯討論過他上述理解。控方指出，陳事實上並無與柯提過庭上他對該點的理解，陳說「唔同意，我唔係好明你個問題嘅事實基礎喺邊度」，其後再稱他有向柯「簡單提及過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方問柯曾否表明非攬炒一分子-官質疑問題毫無作用&quot;&gt;控方問柯曾否表明非「攬炒」一分子 官質疑問題毫無作用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林於6月19日提交提名表格，陳確認柯簽署前曾閱讀表格第二點有關認同戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，但無說或問什麼。控方續展示柯翌日的 Facebook 帖文，提到當天《國安法》細節已公布，「我知道參選甚至如果當選，已經一半踏入監牢，但係面對暴政，絕不退縮」，問為何柯認為自己會犯法，及是否與簽署「墨落」有關，惟陳慶偉均即打斷着問下一題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再問，柯曾否表明他並非「攬炒」的一分子，陳慶偉說「這是一條很差的問題（“I think that is a very bad question.”）」，李亦說「恕我直言」，指即使柯有這樣說過，如何能幫助控方，並指舉證責任在控方，不能以此反證其案情（“By establishing the negative, doesn’t help you build a positive case.”），「這問題毫無用處。（“… the question is useless.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱地區直選不方便直接與劉凱文合作婉轉表達反攬炒-官質疑邏輯&quot;&gt;陳稱地區直選不方便直接、與劉凱文合作婉轉表達反「攬炒」 官質疑邏輯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳穎琛表示會嘗試另一方法，惟李運騰指由他來，並問柯有否提過不同意「攬炒」的意念。陳回應：「我哋喺內部嘅討論，同埋經過同（衛生服務界）劉凱文嘅合作，其實都表達到出嚟。」陳仲衡指，但他們是想選民而不只是內部知道，問選民如何知道。陳展浚指「地區直選就唔方便用咁直接嘅方法，咁所以我哋咪用咗個婉轉嘅方法。」陳慶偉提高聲線問：「陳先生，你認真嗎？」陳展浚答：「認真。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續在法官陳仲衡詢問下確認，劉凱文並無簽署「墨落無悔」。陳仲衡續問那據其邏輯，透過與柯合作，人們也會認為劉支持或同意「墨落」？陳回應：「劉凱文反對攬炒嗰個形象嗰個立場，絕對大過我哋有簽聲明呢個認知，公眾多數認識佢就係因為佢反對攬炒。」控方質疑公眾如何知道，問劉提到反對攬炒的訪問有否附在柯的選舉單張和 Facebook，陳指沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱國安法後審視文宣-惟無移除墨落以免被攻擊&quot;&gt;陳稱《國安法》後審視文宣 惟無移除「墨落」以免被攻擊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於就戴耀廷7月8日及9日記者會，提到「35+計劃」目標及違反《國安法》的風險，陳展浚均稱無印象，亦不知7月時戴曾就初選合法性公開發言。陳同意，對《國安法》實施感到擔心，「我哋有審視文宣嘅內容，用字更加小心」，但沒有再審視「墨落」亦沒有移除帖文，因柯若刪文或會被攻擊「退縮」或「做乜突然間 delete 咗」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑控方重複提問着善用法庭時間&quot;&gt;官質疑控方重複提問、着善用法庭時間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳穎琛續指，柯認為聲明或違《國安法》，卻在《國安法》後仍保留該帖文，惟陳慶偉不耐煩打斷說「Thank you」，示意問下一條問題，李運騰亦指如控方已問了問題，不要只用另一方式再問一次，「你已經得到了答案，請善用法庭時間。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳穎琛續問及柯參選宣言，陳展浚同意該帖文由柯認可（endorse）發布。陳穎琛續指文末附有柯「墨落」帖文的連結，指柯無就此說過任何話？惟陳慶偉再大聲不耐煩打斷：「謝謝，陳小姐」，李運騰亦指證人已肯定地說柯耀林認可此帖文，「為何你一直重複問同一條問題？你還想說什麼？」陳慶偉亦指：「重複與說服是兩個完全不同的概念（“Repetition and persuasion are two completely different concepts.”）」，陳仲衡亦說：「你想問一些東西與你有東西要問，兩者是有分別。（“There is a difference between you want to ask something and you have something to ask.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;初選論壇提兌現協議書-陳指屬贏咗有得選輸咗冇得選&quot;&gt;初選論壇提兌現「協議書」 陳指屬「贏咗有得選，輸咗冇得選」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後問及初選論壇上，柯耀林曾表示「我哋會兌現今次我哋初選簽嗰個協議書，我哋係會支持所有⋯出選初選嘅候選人」，問柯指「協議書」是什麼。陳指是初選提名表格，指柯認知協議是「贏咗有得選，輸咗冇得選」，因此「就算林卓廷贏咗，佢都唔會因為一啲過去嘅恩怨，而唔支持勝出嘅人」，陳志全發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱認為七一前國安法不追究&quot;&gt;陳稱認為七一前《國安法》不追究&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳穎琛其後問可否進行小休，法官陳慶偉關注還有多少要問，陳說會非常短，陳慶偉續着繼續提問。陳穎琛遂俯身問左右兩邊的萬德豪和周天行，後向法官指：「若是這樣，我們盤問完結」，陳仲衡問「那短的部分呢？」，庭上傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，控方除了指證人所說的不正確，有沒有任何案情要向他指出？陳穎琛續向陳展浚指，柯耀林發布「墨落」聲明，是有意圖依從（comply）該聲明。李運騰即邊皺眉邊張大嘴巴，神情錯愕。陳展浚指不同意，並指柯無移除聲明其中一個原因，是「我哋認為7月1號之前嘅嘢，《國安法》係唔會追究嘅」，故無因《國安法》實施而審視或移除之前的東西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱曾問鄒家成如何加入聯署-覆問下確認無問自言記憶較混亂&quot;&gt;陳稱曾問鄒家成如何加入聯署 覆問下確認無問自言記憶較混亂&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後進行覆問，就陳今早稱不記得何時私訊鄒家成問如何加入聯署，辯方展示訊息紀錄，顯示6月11日凌晨12時46分，陳向鄒稱來自柯耀林團隊，「我哋願意加入聯署」，鄒覆「好」。陳確認，當時已是柯發布「墨落」帖文後逾20分鐘。辯方問，故陳今早稱曾問鄒如何加入聯署，是記錯了？控方和法官指是引導性問題。陳續同意法官指，訊息無問如何加入聯署，指「因為剛才我作供時都提到對於呢個記憶係比較混亂，有張圖係比較好」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳展浚作供完畢-李予信明作供&quot;&gt;陳展浚作供完畢 李予信明作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示覆問完結，柯耀林案情亦完結。這意味新東案情完結，16名被告中只餘下參選功能組別超級區議會的李予信，及衞生服務界的余慧明未開展辯方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;選舉經理稱「墨落」無強制用否決權 憂不簽遭攻擊遂促柯耀林簽署&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/H1ITjZc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第106天。柯耀林選舉經理陳展浚續作供，供述團隊討論是否簽署「墨落無悔」的經過，其中柯曾於群組表示「呢份嘢講到明會否決財政預算案，戴教授而家都唔講啦」，亦憂聲明成為DQ理據。不過陳認為聲明內容可接受，應考慮簽署，因無強制何時何地或是否須否決預算案，只提到該權力「係其中一個 option」；亦認為聲明是「保守與進步的分界線」。陳並指，當時柯的潛在對手工黨郭永健及人民力量等均已簽署，擔心發起人或隨時截止聯署，並標籤或攻擊其他無簽署者，故凌晨致電柯促他決定，柯終決定簽署。陳並指，柯從無向他表達會否決預算案，但不移除聲明是怕被攻擊，指柯於區議會被本土派針對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又表示，團隊思維進步，但不代表手法激進，他們不同意用「攬炒」爭取民主，而「進步」是指不會像傳統民主派般「淨係坐喺個冷氣房度」、投完票「話民主今日最黑暗就算數」。法官李運騰一度笑言在冷氣房可做到很多事，「我在冷氣房寫判詞。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳認為墨落聲明無強制須否決預算案僅列為一個選項&quot;&gt;陳認為「墨落」聲明無強制須否決預算案、僅列為一個選項&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林的助理及選舉經理陳展浚續作供。陳昨表示，曾為柯耀林於 Facebook 發布「墨落無悔」聲明帖文，事前有與柯於 WhatsApp 討論。辯方大律師唐樂山今展示名為「2R戰略討論處」的 WhatsApp 群組對話紀錄，陳指於2020年5月成立，是柯耀林（Ricky）和區鎮樺（Ray）討論選舉的地方，成員最主要為兩人的團隊，但選舉完結和本案拘捕發生後，很多人也退出群組，包括區鎮樺，陳於半年前進行截圖時群組只餘下3人。至於陳昨稱沙田區政丁仕元和李永成也有意參選，陳指二人其後也無進一步意欲或行動參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;紀錄顯示，6月10日晚區鎮樺於群組轉發鄒家成「墨落無悔」聲明連結，稱「又夾硬夾人」，陳展浚其後亦轉發「墨落」聲明全文，表示：「應要考慮 內容係啱 呢個係保守與進步的分界線」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 2018年12月12日 59人宣布退出民主黨（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問「內容係啱」的意思，陳解釋「墨落」聲明第一點提及認同五大訴求，「喺嗰個時空底下呢，認同五大訴求係一個作為民主派最基本嘅基礎」；至於「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，陳認為否決財案「的確係《基本法》賦予立法會議員嘅其中一個權力」，但聲明「冇強制何時何地或者係咪必須要實行呢個權力，佢只係講呢個權力只係其中一個 option（選項）嚟㗎啫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「墨落」第二點「我認同若支持度跌出各區預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」，陳指「我哋認為係新界東協調會嘅共識，亦都係初選最重要嘅基礎」，因此認為聲明「整體睇落去講嘅嘢係冇乜問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱從新聞得悉運用否決權非新東協調會議共識&quot;&gt;陳稱從新聞得悉運用否決權非新東協調會議共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳展浚同意法官陳仲衡指，他無在該 WhatsApp 對話提到上述就運用否決權的理解，但他之後曾與柯通電話談到，「法官大人可以繼續靜候聽咗先。」陳續解釋認為就第一點聲明，除認同五大訴求外，不認為其餘內容是共識，「因為至少李永成就反對。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 李永成（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，但柯只曾出席首次協調會議的頭半部分、缺席第二次會議、無收到文件，根本不知道會議發生何事。陳同意未能完全知悉會議內容，亦無向李永成或組織者查詢，但新聞提及李永成對否決財案有不同意見，故「達成共識呢樣嘢應該就係冇發生到囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，因此當陳說「內容係啱」，是指這是會議上同意的事項，抑或聲明兩點可以接受？陳指是「內容係睇落去可以接受」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指柯對聯署有擔心-憂成dq理據或違國安法&quot;&gt;陳指柯對聯署有擔心 憂成DQ理據或違《國安法》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，若認為運用否決權非協調共識，為何柯耀林在 WhatsApp 提到「墨落」有機會成為DQ理由。陳展浚解釋因當時已「講緊會立《國安法》」，柯不知道DQ的紅線或準則，又指「佢不嬲對於一啲聯署、各式各樣嘅聯署都有擔心嘅」，尤其當有機會立《國安法》，便認為有機會成為DQ理據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，即當時柯認為「墨落」有機會違《國安法》？陳說「可以咁講」，並重申柯「覺得好多嘢都有風險」，因認為《國安法》無詳細解釋或任何標準，即使未頒布條文，亦有「好強烈嘅擔心或者恐懼」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，那為何陳展浚起初又說柯對政治無興趣、不閱讀新聞，只透過陳了解政治議題。陳展浚指無提過柯對政治無興趣，只是他工作很忙，「佢係冇咁嘅習慣去閱讀一啲可能比較政治性嘅新聞例如戴耀廷嘅文章等」，並依靠他們就政治發展作更新，但不代表柯對於立《國安法》等完全無基本認知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱因否決權非共識但墨落發起人放進聲明-區鎮樺才稱又夾硬夾人&quot;&gt;陳稱因否決權非共識但「墨落」發起人放進聲明 區鎮樺才稱「又夾硬夾人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續關注，當時群組無提及「墨落」第一點並非協調會議共識，陳展浚回應，相信區鎮樺稱「又夾硬夾人」就是此意思。陳慶偉問，既然陳認為並無強制否決，那為何當時不向柯解釋，「我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力」一句，其實是「我會考慮運用基本法賦予立法會的權力」？陳先說「我哋嘅認知呢係呢個冇強制性」，並在追問下反問：「其實我哋都唔係發起或者草擬聯署一方，咁點解要自己去修改嗰個內容呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續在追問下，指不知道新東第二次協調會上，就「會」、「會積極」運用否決權有激烈的討論。陳慶偉問既然如此，他如何能說這是共識，陳指「我從來冇提及過否決財政預算案係任何共識喎」，並重申認為該點並非共識，但「墨落」發起人卻放進聲明，因此區鎮樺才稱「又嚟夾人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注柯曾稱聲明講到明否決財案-陳指柯無向他表達過會否決財案&quot;&gt;官關注柯曾稱聲明「講到明」否決財案 陳指柯無向他表達過會否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰亦關注，就陳展浚稱「墨落」無強制須用否決權，柯耀林似乎不同意，並引柯於群組稱：「呢份嘢講到明會否決財政預算案，戴教授而家都唔講啦」。陳表示，柯在「墨落」發布前或後不曾向他表達過有意否決預算案，亦曾表達他不同意「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，從上述訊息字面上來看，陳認同柯對聲明中運用否決權一點的理解與他不同嗎？陳說字面上是這樣，但在之後的口頭討論，柯曾表示「覺得戴教授已經冇提呢樣嘢，或者冇任何文章或新聞講呢個意思」，感覺「呢個聲明再 raise 返呢件事出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續指，「我以為柯先生依靠你提供資訊」，陳同意，但指柯亦是物業管理公司的營運總監，「所以佢每日都會摷啲報紙，點都睇到 topic（標題），因為佢會睇啲招標廣告。」李運騰聞言搖頭，並問因此柯有閱讀報紙的習慣？陳說：「佢有閱讀招標廣告嘅習慣」，庭上傳出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱路線上需與民主黨有區別-因墨落看上去進步故應簽署&quot;&gt;陳稱路線上需與民主黨有區別 因「墨落」看上去「進步」故應簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於簽署聲明為何屬「保守與進步的分界線」，陳解釋「只要進步過民主黨嘅話呢，就係進步，唔係保守」，而當時認為「睇落去個聲明係進步嘅聲明，所以應該要考慮（簽署）」，黃碧雲與林卓廷對視而笑。陳續解釋，「因為大家都喺民主黨退黨出嚟」，故參選立法會時路線上需有些區別；亦相信民主黨決策程序較慢，就是否簽署聲明應「冇咁快做到呢個決定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱柯被本土派針對-曾因倡建周梓樂陳彥霖紀念公園被掟人血饅頭&quot;&gt;陳稱柯被本土派針對 曾因倡建周梓樂陳彥霖紀念公園被掟「人血饅頭」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於與本土派的關係，陳指在西貢區議會「本土派其實都幾針對我哋」，原因與區議會選舉協調和區議會議題上的衝突有關，「可能有啲恩怨」；又指將軍澳民生關注組曾動議將兩個由西貢區議會出資興建的公園，改名為周梓樂和陳彥霖紀念公園，本土派議員葉子祈遂向柯「掟『人血饅頭』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱工黨郭永健簽署後即致電柯耀林望盡快做決定-柯終同意簽署&quot;&gt;陳稱工黨郭永健簽署後即致電柯耀林望盡快做決定 柯終同意簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就柯耀林最終如何決定簽署「墨落」，對話紀錄顯示當晚鄭仲文提到「人力落水了，柯生快動員」，陳展浚表示「遲簽冇乜用」，至翌日零時12分，柯耀林稱他早上7點要開街站，而何聞達於零時18分轉發「墨落」聲明，提到「唔掂，即跟，郭永健跟咗」，陳展浚即回覆「同意」，並於3分鐘後回覆「打左比柯生 跟」，至零時24分何聞達再稱「最緊要早過饅頭雄同范國威」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問郭永健簽署有何特別，陳解釋曾與郭永健合作，認為「佢都唔係咁快做決定嘅人」，而郭立場較溫和，「大家都係潛在競爭對手，佢都跟咗，我哋需要跟」。陳並指，柯稱要開街站後便「上床瞓」，而陳覆「同意」後立即致電柯，「佢嗰陣未瞓着，不過都懵懵地」，陳遂告知柯人民力量、公民黨和工黨郭永健已「跟咗」，他們很擔心發起人會否隨時截止聯署的更新或參與，「繼而標籤或者攻擊其他冇簽嘅人」，故致電柯「希望盡快做出一個決定」。而陳「攞咗 instruction」後，立即回覆群組指柯會簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後指，鄭達鴻曾供稱公民黨討論是否簽「墨落」至6月11日下午，陳承認當時較混亂，故就公民黨是否已簽署「唔肯定」。至於「最緊要早過饅頭雄同范國威」一句，陳解釋是指「最緊要早過梁國雄同范國威」，而范當時未簽署，至翌日下午才簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳發布墨落時將柯耀林名字置於郭永健前-認是小學雞行為&quot;&gt;陳發布「墨落」時將柯耀林名字置於郭永健前 認是「小學雞行為」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳展浚續指，他遂在聲明加上柯耀林名字，並於 Facebook 發布。辯方展示柯的帖文，問郭永健比柯耀林早簽署，但為何柯的名字排得比郭前，余慧明和林卓廷等發笑，陳笑說「呢啲俗稱啲小學雞行為嚟嘅」，承認「純粹係唔想落後佢啫」，多人發笑。法官李運騰關注，帖文提到最後更新時間為「00:13」，比陳與柯耀林通電話決定簽署更早，陳指該時間只是「手動打落去」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又確認，當時群組有人不同意此做法，區鎮樺於凌晨約1時稱「我覺得個問題要停一停」，認為就是否簽署「墨落」應先停下討論，惟當時柯已簽署。區亦稱「現在我同柯，一個名在超區，一個在新東」，陳解釋柯出席超區協調會後已不考慮參選超區，不過當時區依然想柯參選超區，而區最終無參加初選，但有簽署「墨落」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指柯從無提倡否決財案-但無移除墨落因怕被攻擊&quot;&gt;陳指柯從無提倡否決財案 但無移除「墨落」因怕被攻擊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問，若柯從來沒有提倡否決預算案，為何不移除「墨落」帖文。陳指「因為我哋驚畀人攻擊啦」，而且本土派區議員葉子祈「經常 mon 住我哋啲 Facebook」。李運騰問，那他們也有否「mon」人 Facebook？陳說：「我哋會，但係我哋唔會 mon 完人之後即刻 cap 圖，發現 delete 咗嘢之後即刻開 post 鬧。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，留意到柯在發布「墨落」後亦提及「民協施德來都簽咗」，陳指柯「純粹可能見到其他都係標籤溫和民主派嘅人都簽咗」。李指，故柯也有留意其他人？陳說始終「發生咁大個聯署，咁大家都會留意事態發生，或者好多時 Facebook 都會睇到好多人 update」。李指似乎柯不需其他人告知他事態發展，陳說「咁冇衝突」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指極權指過分使用武力的警方及容許它的政府&quot;&gt;陳指「極權」指過分使用武力的警方及容許它的政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問及柯耀林的選舉文宣，包括宣傳短片、政綱、和選舉單張，陳展浚均稱有份撰寫內容和設計。就宣傳片段提到「極權壓境之際，更要頑強迎戰」，配上將軍澳尚德邨十字路口的警民衝突相片，陳解釋當時基本上每晚都發生衝突，他們會進行協調、調停或被捕支援，並認為警方有些行動使用暴力並不合理，相信當時警方的「過分武力執法」是「得到政府嘅授意或者縱容」。陳同意，片段提到「極權」是指過分使用武力的警方，及「容許佢過分使用武力嘅政府」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於片段提到參選是「希望立法會能夠多一個行動派」，陳指既指在立法會內做一個「勤力、盡責」的議員，運用議會力量和平台爭取民主、為社區政策或議題努力為市民發聲；亦指「唔係淨係坐喺冷氣房入面，更加要身體力行」，如落社區調停警民衝突，柯亦同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官屢提醒陳展浚就柯耀林想法作供-屬傳聞證供&quot;&gt;官屢提醒陳展浚就柯耀林想法作供 屬傳聞證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就提名表格，陳同意為柯耀林提交，而他從柯得悉首次會議共識（辦初選、「贏咗有得選，宣咗冇得選」、目標議席為「6+1」）的認知沒有改變，法官提醒柯的說法屬傳聞證供。表格附上柯的參選宣言，提到港人要放棄舊有想法，不再被傳統影響抗爭，陳指是不希望港人繼續沉迷經濟發展，應更多關心香港民主進程，鼓勵人投票。惟法官再質疑所有人也能閱讀宣言內容，而證人無法就柯的想法作供，即使事前二人有討論，亦可能是傳聞證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方再問及陳有份草擬的選舉單張是否與預算案有關，惟陳慶偉再指這不是陳的政綱，而是柯的政綱，「柯先生決定不作供沒問題，但你不能問他在想什麼」，李運騰亦指不能要求證人猜測柯的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指柯耀林團隊與劉凱文聯合宣傳-是較婉轉表達反對攬炒&quot;&gt;陳指柯耀林團隊與劉凱文聯合宣傳 是較婉轉表達反對「攬炒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續確認，柯曾與參選衞生服務界的劉凱文聯合宣傳及印發聯合單張，指因劉是將軍澳街坊，亦是年輕進步的民主派，但手法上與他們一樣溫和；又指劉旗幟鮮明反對「攬炒」，而他們亦不同意用「攬炒」方式爭取民主。陳仲衡指單張無表明柯不同意「攬炒」，陳承認當時是使用「比較婉轉」的方法，因當時有很多報導均顯示劉反對「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，「我哋思維進步，但唔代表我哋手法要激進」，在李運騰追問下指「進步」是指「我哋唔係好似傳統民主派咁淨係坐喺個冷氣房度，願意做更多嘅行動去實踐爭取民主」。李運騰笑言在冷氣房可以做到很多事，「我在冷氣房寫判詞」，旁聽人士發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續問陳指行動是什麼？陳指包括在衝突現場監察警方執法並嘗試調解，他們曾成功阻止防暴隊進入屋苑行動或施放催淚彈；又指要用議員權力監督政府，「唔係投完票，話民主今日最黑暗就算數喇。」李運騰說那不是在冷氣房完成嗎？陳僅重申議員不能只在冷氣房，亦指單張提到「站在衝突前線，與手足同路並肩同行」，不代表無調停雙方衝突。陳慶偉遂指，即使兩人曾聯合宣傳，但不代表他們有相同政綱，辯方指會留待陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳終表示，以他所知，柯沒有與其他人達成協議否決預算案以迫使政府回應五大訴求，亦無協議顛覆國家政權。唐樂山表示主問完畢，控方明早進行盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

Yet other signs, such as Prigozhin shaking hands with officials from the Central African Republic (CAR) in Saint Petersburg while the 2023 Russia-Africa summit was unfolding, or Russian flags being flown during the Niger coup this July, suggest that Russia’s influence in Africa is here to stay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current volatile situation calls for a coolheaded look at the fundamentals of Russia’s existing footprint and its forays across the continent, to better assess how they might evolve and how to address them. Russia’s breakthroughs in Africa are owed in part to a rekindling of Soviet-era relations. Yet the Kremlin’s remarkable advances on the continent throughout the last decade also result from twin contemporary efforts: adept diplomatic reengagement with key regional players and opportunistic predation in areas where Western powers are either absent or in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the U.S.-led effort to form a global coalition aimed at isolating Russia internationally has indeed strengthened the transatlantic alliance, it has not yet fully convinced the rest of the world, including countries on the African continent, to break ties with Moscow. In fact, many across Africa regard the war in Ukraine as primarily a Western problem and are preoccupied with protecting their own national interests. Even with the war and sanctions straining Russia’s economy and defense sector, the Kremlin retains sufficient ties with the continent to challenge Western narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines Russia’s creeping influence over Africa, assessing Moscow’s historic legacy as well as the current diplomatic, economic, and military-security links that contribute to the region’s continued willingness to engage with Russia. In doing so, particular attention is paid to the Russian private military company (PMC) Wagner Group, which has been playing an important role in forging ties between the Kremlin and different African nations, despite the uncertainty following Prigozhin’s rebellion in June 2023. It then offers analysis and recommendations to Western policymakers, outlining new approaches the transatlantic community should adopt to counter a rising Russia in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-kremlins-playbook-in-africa-from-diplomatic-to-military-footprint&quot;&gt;The Kremlin’s Playbook in Africa: From Diplomatic to Military Footprint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is commonly argued that the hesitancy of many African states to openly condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is rooted in the deep Soviet-era ties Moscow forged with the continent, which continue to generate a lot of sympathy and respect toward Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from the mid-1950s, as Africa turned into another important Cold War battleground, the Soviet Union became actively involved in reshaping the continent’s political and security landscape by granting generous economic and security assistance programs to many different local Marxist, anti-colonial, or anti-U.S. groups. By supporting independence movements during a period of colonial conflict and aiding governments that faced internal or external confrontation, the Soviet Union managed to penetrate all the major countries across Africa, including but not limited to Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Mozambique. The Kremlin supplied those states with weapons and equipment, provided military training and advisers, and developed relations between the Soviet and various African intelligence communities, ultimately creating “a long-term legacy of Soviet hardware and operational culture throughout Africa.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8G7xTQu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Leonid Brezhnev, general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, meets with the new Egyptian president, Anwar al-Sadat, in Moscow, the latter seeking political support and military hardware from the Soviet Union for use in Egypt’s imminent war with Israel, 1971.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the newly established Russian Federation—finding itself in political and socioeconomic turmoil—was forced to disengage from the continent, which meant that its generous economic and military assistance programs came to an abrupt halt. For around two decades after the Soviet collapse, Russian activity in Africa was marginal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-diplomatic-reengagement-with-africa&quot;&gt;Russia’s Diplomatic Reengagement with Africa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow’s first visible attempts to reengage with the continent started in the mid-2000s. In 2006, President Vladimir Putin visited the Republic of South Africa, followed by his successor Dmitry Medvedev’s trips to Egypt, Angola, Nigeria, and Namibia in 2009. The Kremlin doubled down on its diplomatic efforts following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, when the first round of Western sanctions against Russia forced Moscow to actively seek new geopolitical partners and business opportunities. Since 2014, various high-ranking Russian state officials—including Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev, and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov—have frequented different African states and signed multiple bilateral military, economic, and security cooperation agreements, as well as written off billions of dollars in African debts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s return to Africa has also coincided with (and has been encouraged by) the reduced U.S. engagement with the continent, including the 2018 decision under the Trump administration to scale back U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the region despite the growing terror threat in many African nations. Moscow was quick to fill that security void. In 2019, President Putin hosted the first-ever Russia-Africa summit at the Black Sea retreat of Sochi, aimed at reinforcing Russia’s standing as a reliable strategic partner on the continent and securing military contract agreements with different nations, including the Nigerian government, which agreed to purchase Russian attack helicopters. In July 2023, despite the war, sanctions, and Western pressure, 17 heads of African states attended the second Russia-Africa summit, signing several agreements with Russia on prevention of arms race in space, cooperation in informational security, and combating terrorism on the continent. Moscow also promised to write off additional debts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wW9NlK4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ President Putin, African leaders, and heads of delegations pose for a group photo at the second Russia-Africa summit held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, on July 28, 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ongoing diplomatic efforts, encompassing high-level visits, debt relief, and strategic partnership agreements, have proved to be particularly useful at the United Nations. The Kremlin has been able to count on the backing of many African nations on key UN votes, including the 2014 General Assembly resolution condemning the Russian annexation of Crimea, the 2018 resolution urging Moscow to demilitarize the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, and the 2022 resolution decrying Russia’s attempted annexation of four Ukrainian regions. In all three cases, a considerable number of African countries voted against the proposed resolutions, abstained, or did not show up for the vote, thus directly or indirectly contributing to the Kremlin’s efforts at challenging the United States and its allies within international frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russo-african-economic-and-trade-relations&quot;&gt;Russo-African Economic and Trade Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to strengthening diplomatic ties with African states, the Kremlin has also expanded its economic footprint on the continent. For instance, trade revenue between Russia and African countries almost doubled from $9.9 billion in 2013 to $17.7 billion by 2021. Grain exports are of particular importance, as nearly 30 percent of Africa’s grain supplies come from Russia. Moscow’s leading trade partners in the region are countries in North Africa—particularly Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco—which together account for approximately 67 percent of Russia’s total trade with the continent. Moscow mainly exports wheat, coal, refined petroleum, and electronics to these states, while importing fruits, sugar, and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s recent withdrawal from the Black Sea grain deal—which enabled Ukraine to safely export grain to different parts of the world, including Africa—may benefit Moscow’s own grain exports by cutting Kyiv out of the global market and increasing the dependence of a number of African republics on Russian grain. Moscow has maintained that it will do “all it can” to shield Africa from the negative consequences of the halted grain deal, with President Putin asserting that “our country is capable of replacing Ukrainian grain on a commercial and a gratuitous basis.” During the 2023 Russia-Africa summit, Putin even promised to start shipping free grain in the next several months to six African nations significantly impacted by the cancellation of the grain deal: Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Mali, Somalia, Eritrea, and the CAR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of Russia’s economic outreach to Africa is that it is dominated by Russian companies that are either partially or fully owned by the state, including oil and gas giants Rosneft, Tatneft, and Gazprom, which carry out major hydrocarbon projects in North Africa. Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear power company, has also been actively engaged with different countries across the continent. For instance, in summer 2022, it received permission from an Egyptian regulator to start building Egypt’s first nuclear power plant, based on the 2017 agreement signed between President Putin and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The plant is expected to become fully operational by 2030. Rosatom also funds different educational and cultural exchange opportunities in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields to support the Kremlin’s soft power efforts in Africa. In addition to energy deals, Moscow has also boosted cooperation with different states rich in natural resources, primarily diamonds. For instance, Alrosa, Russia’s top diamond mining company, has expanded its operations in Angola, Congo, and Zimbabwe. Importantly, according to some African scholars, “Russia is highlighting collaboration over aid” when seeking lucrative business opportunities in Africa, thus stressing partnerships of equals, “and that message is tempting to some leaders who view the West’s outreach as patronizing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, despite Russia’s ongoing efforts to build stronger business and trade ties with the continent, the Kremlin’s economic engagements in Africa today are modest when compared to those of the Soviet Union, as well as those of the modern-day China, United States, and European Union. While trade revenue between Russia and African countries comprises around $17.7 billion, Africa’s trade value with the European Union, China, and the United States currently stands at $295 billion, $254 billion, and $65 billion, respectively. Russia also invests little in Africa, representing less than 1 percent of total foreign direct investment (FDI) going to the continent. Moscow’s main competitive advantage against the global powers seeking to expand their footprint on the continent is therefore its ability to render relatively cheap security and military services, including arms transfers, as well as anti-insurgency training and consultancy services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russo-african-defense-and-security-cooperation&quot;&gt;Russo-African Defense and Security Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Kremlin continues to be a small player in Africa when measured by its economic and trade relations, it retains strong defense and security ties with the continent, spanning arms sales, joint military training programs, and Russian PMC activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is the chief arms supplier to Africa, accounting for 40 percent of African imports of major weapons systems between 2018 and 2022. This has been higher than the total arms imports from the United States (16 percent), China (9.8 percent), and France (7.6 percent) during those years. According to a report by the RAND Corporation, Russian weapons sales to Africa have increased from around $500 million to over $2 billion annually in recent years. The key importers of Russian weapons systems are the North African countries Algeria and Egypt, with 73 percent and 34 percent of their arms imports, respectively, coming from Russia. Both states have purchased billions of dollars’ worth of weapons and equipment from Moscow since 2013, including the Su-24, Su-30, and MiG-29 combat aircraft, as well as the S-300 missile systems, among others. Besides Algeria and Egypt, many other countries across the continent also receive Russian matériel, including but not limited to Mali, Sudan, the CAR, and Angola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons explaining the dependency of African countries on Russian-made weapons and equipment. Modern Russian arms are usually cheaper than their Western alternatives and compatible with Soviet-era stocks retained by many states on the continent. Additionally, unlike the United States and its allies, the Kremlin does not make its arms deliveries contingent upon adherence to democratic principles or the protection of basic human rights; it has sent armor, combat aircraft, and missile systems to different war-torn countries in Africa—including Libya, where it has supported eastern Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar’s fight against the UN-recognized Government of National Accord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides arms transfers, Moscow has advanced military diplomacy in the region by engaging different African countries in Russian-led military forums and exercises, including the International Army Games, which since 2015 has been attended by around a dozen African states, such as Angola, Algeria, Congo, Mali, and Zimbabwe. The Kremlin has also organized the annual naval (“Friendship Bridge”) and aerial (“Defenders of Friendship”) exercises between the Russian and Egyptian armies and supported UN peace operations in Congo, Western Sahara, Sudan, and South Sudan by providing a limited number of military observers. Yet, while the official Russian military presence might seem modest, it is usually supplemented by Russian PMC activities, which have been rather extensive on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the exact numbers of Russian private military companies or operations in Africa are difficult to estimate, available reporting shows that there have been at least seven Russian PMCs that have carried out at a minimum 34 operations in 16 African countries since 2005. PMCs became particularly active in the mid-2010s following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its intervention in the Syrian war in 2015, both of which enabled Russia to advertise and offer its PMC services—from providing private security and military training to conducting combat operations—to different governments and separatist groups across Africa. According to RAND, Russian PMCs have a substantial presence in the CAR, Sudan, and South Sudan. They are also found in a number of other African states, including Congo, Gabon, Libya, Mali, and Madagascar. What makes the proliferation of Russian PMCs in Africa particularly noteworthy is that, in virtually all cases, they have strong ties with the Kremlin. As Major Thomas D. Arnold of the U.S. Army argues, “Russia effectively trades PMSC [private military and security company] services for access and economic concessions in resource-endowed fragile states.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most prominent among the Russian PMCs operating in Africa is the Wagner Group, owned by Prigozhin, an infamous Russian businessman dubbed “Putin’s Chef” whose notoriety increased immensely following his June 2023 short-lived armed mutiny against the Russian government, and particularly the Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD). However, prior to the June uprising, the Wagner chief was known as one of President Putin’s most loyal subordinates. For instance, in 2018, the United States indicted Prigozhin for financing a Russian troll factory that had spearheaded Moscow’s efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. As for having strong links to the Russian government, Wagner forces were allegedly trained along with the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation’s (GRU) special forces units. The PMC gained notoriety for its participation in the 2014 Ukrainian and 2015 Syrian conflicts. In Syria, due to Wagner’s assistance to the Assad regime, several Prigozhin-owned or closely linked companies struck exclusive oil and gas deals with the government, thus enabling the Kremlin to get its share of Syria’s energy revenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner adopted and further developed a similar strategy in Africa, where it has advised tottering leaders, run pro-government and disinformation campaigns, conducted military training and anti-insurgency operations, and, in return, secured concessions in extractive industries, particularly gold, diamond, and uranium mining. For instance, in CAR, at various times since 2018 up to 1,900 “Russian instructors” (i.e., Wagner and its subsidiaries) have provided escort protection to the country’s senior officials, including President Touadéra, and have assisted the Russian MOD with arms deliveries and on-site military training. In return, the Kremlin has been able to explore “the possibilities of the mutually beneficial development of Central African natural resources,” with Prigozhin-linked companies spearheading gold and diamond mining efforts in the republic. In Sudan, Wagner has provided site security to Prigozhin-owned gold mining companies and has been actively involved in strengthening ties with General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), a deputy head of Sudan’s ruling council, to establish its first naval base in Port Sudan. Similarly, in Libya, the Kremlin reportedly sent up to 1,200 Wagner contractors to aid General Khalifa Haftar, a de facto ruler of eastern Libya in control of a significant share of the country’s oil reserves, in exchange for securing economic concessions that included Russian oil giant Rosneft’s access to the country’s lucrative oil market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Demonstrators hold banners and a Russian flag in the capital city of Bangui, CAR, in March 2023. Taking advantage of the security vacuum created by the departure of French troops from the country, Moscow first sent “military instructors” to CAR in 2018, followed by hundreds of Wagner troops in 2020 at the request of President Touadéra to help him fend off a dangerous rebellion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia’s military presence in Africa, focused on the strengthening of both official and unofficial channels of defense-security cooperation with different African states, has proved to be a cost-effective way for the Kremlin to gain considerable political and economic leverage on the continent that even the 2022 war in Ukraine has been unable to undermine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-continued-progress-in-africa-despite-the-war-in-ukraine-and-domestic-fissure&quot;&gt;Russia’s Continued Progress in Africa, despite the War in Ukraine and Domestic Fissure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Russia’s military shortcomings in Ukraine—including incurring significant personnel and equipment losses, struggling to produce advanced weapons systems, and increasing reliance on Soviet-era defense equipment—there have not yet been any tangible signs of African countries actively seeking to replace Moscow as a chief arms supplier or military partner. In fact, throughout 2022, a number of countries on the continent initiated new or continued existing military cooperation agreements with the Kremlin. Cameroon, for instance, signed a new defense deal with the Russian MOD entailing joint military trainings, and Mali received military equipment from Moscow. In 2023, the Russia-Africa summit participants agreed to establish a new permanent Russo-African security mechanism, aimed at combating terrorism and extremism on the continent. However, some negative trends have also been observed. For example, Algeria and Egypt, which have long been listed among Russia’s top five arms purchasers globally, slowly started to lessen defense ties with the Kremlin in 2022. Yet, considering the large reliance of both countries on Russian-origin arms, they will most likely maintain defense cooperation with Moscow in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the Russian armed forces, Wagner has sustained significant losses in Ukraine. In May 2023, Prigozhin openly accused the Russian MOD for not supplying his PMC with enough ammunition during the fight for the city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. A month later, this disagreement led to the Prigozhin-orchestrated “march for justice” against Moscow, which, even if brief, has given rise to a number of questions connected with the stability of the Putin regime, as well as the future of Wagner in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HkpDe1i.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Wagner soldiers sit on the top of a tank in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, on June 24, 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the uprising, experts believed that, even if Wagner were to be sidelined in Ukraine, the PMC would not “fade into obscurity.” Instead, it would pivot back to Africa, where it still retained a comparative advantage against the backdrop of a new wave of insurgencies spanning the continent, resuming limited-scale “expeditionary operations and supplying muscle to fragile states in exchange for access to valuable resources.” Indeed, in March 2023, Wagner was already actively recruiting new contractors willing to serve terms ranging from 9 to 14 months in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also argued that, by putting a private army to work in the region, Prigozhin was able to at least partially fund Wagner’s war effort in Ukraine. This, in most cases, was achieved by expanding the PMC-linked mining operations across the continent. For instance, in exchange for supporting regime stability in CAR, Wagner reportedly gained some degree of control over the country’s international airport, flying gold worth billions of U.S. dollars that it had been mining in CAR from the capital of Bangui straight to Moscow. According to some estimates, despite the allied sanctions imposed on Russia, Moscow’s gold reserves reached an all-time high in the first quarter of 2023. Similar to in CAR, Wagner continued to exploit the existing power struggle in Sudan, allegedly assisting the country’s General Hemedti through Wagner’s Libyan partner General Haftar, and thus attempting to preserve Russia’s ongoing gold mining operations in Sudan and advance the Kremlin’s interests of building a naval base along the Red Sea in Port Sudan. Experts believe that, if Moscow is ultimately successful at gaining port access in Africa, it will be well positioned to “disrupt naval and maritime passage along the central and eastern Mediterranean, and establish coastal airfields that would make global transit of Russian aircraft—including anti-submarine aircraft—possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the June mutiny, the Kremlin is now forced to come up with a plan dealing with the reorganization of Wagner’s ongoing operations in Africa as seamlessly as possible. As one of Prigozhin’s people stated after the uprising, “entire sectors of Russian foreign policy are dependent on the assets of Wagner PMC abroad, and if they are removed, there will be a rapid compression of Russian influence, more in Africa, to a lesser extent in Syria.” In fact, the CAR leadership has already expressed concerns regarding the Wagner chief’s highly precarious position inside Russia and how this would impact the PMC’s presence in the country; yet the leadership has also declared readiness to sign contracts with other Russian “instructors,” should Moscow decide so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, no matter how the war in Ukraine plays out or how the fate of Prigozhin is ultimately decided, the Kremlin will likely have strong incentives to maintain its use of PMCs—including a restructured Wagner Group or its subsidiaries—in Africa to ensure uninterrupted access to the continent’s gold reserves, among other benefits, and to destabilize Western strategic partnerships with different African states. Importantly, as the invasion of Ukraine will inevitably produce more veterans seeking adequate remuneration amid Russia’s wartime economy, it can be expected that Russian PMCs might expand the size and scale of their current operations in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-do-now-new-offer-new-tactics-and-new-branding&quot;&gt;What to Do Now? New Offer, New Tactics, and New Branding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s forays in Africa present the West with serious strategic dilemmas, as letting Russia expand further affects the United States and allied interests, but attacking it head-on can backfire and end up fueling Moscow’s narrative, something recently experienced by France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the West cannot afford to stand idle and resort only to “strategic patience,” as the stakes are too high considering that Africa is the continent with the youngest and fastest-growing population, with daunting challenges that have direct consequences for global security and stability. Russia is both uninterested and unable to foster sound and sustainable development in Africa, as it does not provide substantial aid nor capacity building beyond the military-security realm. Instead, its entrenchment can only compound the challenges that Africa faces and comes with major risks, especially for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it would be delusive to expect new grand strategies at times when the United States and Europe struggle to sustain their joint efforts in the two most pressing theaters of strategic competition: Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific. Traditional key Western stakeholders in Africa such as the United States and France have both recently heralded a “reframing” of their approaches, in which the security component is relegated to the background, to the benefit of political, economic, and social engagements. This is a sound evolution—especially considering that ongoing Russian efforts in these arenas are rather limited—but it leaves free ground for Russian progress in the security realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new rules of engagement for the West to confront Russia in Africa therefore stand somewhere between “strategic patience” and “grand strategy.” This section lays out recommendations for Western policymakers, stressing the importance of equal footing cooperation with African partners in order to offer attractive and efficient alternatives catered to the region’s security and prosperity aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overarching-recommendations&quot;&gt;Overarching Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Devise a security cooperation package that will be principled but not transactional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s current approach of providing security assistance through Wagner remains attractive to many African nations despite it being expensive in the longer term (local governments have to pay the PMC for its services in addition to accepting its multiyear commercial conditions, while also losing at least part of Western aid and risking sanctions). This is because the “regime survival package” offered by Russia in the region, which is beset by chronic instability and military coups, supersedes any other potential gains from traditional cooperation agreements advanced by Western partners, which are usually based on institutional capacity building instead of securing the authorities themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mali, for instance, Wagner agreed to provide the Malian authorities with helicopters and ammunition that the French were always reluctant to consider due to rising levels of violence and continued insurgencies, among other reasons. This issue calls for a more horizontal and less vertical Western approach to cooperation that will remain principled, but not based on conditions. Western security assistance should thus ultimately serve political objectives that are consistent with the transatlantic community’s values and principles, but due diligence should be conducted upstream through arms control policies and downstream through accompaniment and monitoring—not during the negotiation phase or political engagement, so as to alleviate the sentiment that Western support is a politically motivated bargaining chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redouble efforts in the energy domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia does not thrive in Africa only through Wagner and security assistance, even though its efforts in this regard are particularly extensive. Moscow also offers assistance in the energy domain, notably through a push for nuclear energy to meet the continent’s growing needs. While Western countries are late to engage in energy diplomacy in Africa, they should redouble their efforts, as this will be one of the key parameters of strategic competition on the continent. Engaging in energy diplomacy is also central to countering the widespread narrative that Western countries are only interested in plundering the continent’s resources for their own prosperity, without benefiting Africans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build strategic partnerships free from “neo–Cold War” perceptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be recognized as a preferable alternative to Russia, the West should direct its efforts toward the key “swing states”: major regional players that maintain close ties with the Kremlin, such as Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, and Egypt. Yet the Western reengagement should not resemble a neo–Cold War approach, forcing the countries to take sides through “carrots and sticks.” Instead, it should take the form of a strategic dialogue aimed at better understanding why these African states maintain ties with Russia, in order to assess if the West can offer something more attractive. The West should also strengthen partnerships with other countries on the continent committed to building functioning institutions, robust militaries, and strong technological bases, including but not limited to Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya, and Botswana, especially when those countries are courted by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Actively prove Russian narratives wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West should continue exposing the failures of corrupt regimes, especially those that engage in mafia-type deals with the Russian government, as well as widespread atrocities and human rights abuses committed by Russia-linked groups—including Wagner paramilitaries—in Africa. But perhaps more importantly, the United States and the European Union should promote their own success stories in the region, while also reflecting on the legitimate concerns of many African nations. The West should also invest more in establishing or supporting reliable local pan-African media outlets promoting African voices and perspectives on key regional issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engage with new partners that are more palatable to the African public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many African countries are enthusiastic about increased “South to South” cooperation and would welcome engagement with leaders from the Global South. However, these relations remain largely nascent at this stage, as the major nonaligned states such as Brazil or India are also figuring out how to best engage with Africa. In the longer term, increased “triangulation” between Africa, the Global South, and the West could prove mutually beneficial, with India and Brazil becoming the key partners in this effort as they are pro-democracy without appearing anti-Russian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preserve an ability to act against traditional and potential new threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s continued advances in Africa are also risk multipliers, with the most prominent one being rising levels of terrorism in the countries where Russians, including Wagner fighters, set foot. According to the 2022 Global Terrorism Index, 48 percent of all terrorism-related deaths worldwide occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, with three of the top ten countries—Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger—all having a Wagner presence. Increased levels of terrorism coupled with the ongoing Russian hybrid warfare efforts in the region—including information warfare and cyberattacks, weaponization of migration, and disruption of critical infrastructure—have the potential to further fuel instability and insecurity on the continent. Facing these threats implies that the West should retain certain capabilities in the region, including defensive equipment and airlift options, to protect both Western citizens and African partners in case of serious violent outbreaks, as well as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities to disclose intelligence on Wagner’s nefarious activities on the continent to partners in Africa and dissuade them from partnering with the PMC. Finally, the United States and its allies should also retain an ability to carry out defensive strikes against Wagner in the event of an assault, as happened in Syria in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;country-specific-recommendations&quot;&gt;Country-Specific Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The United States: Africa is too important to be let down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently published public documents, as well as statements by U.S. government officials, show Washington’s eagerness to treat African countries as peer partners, which undoubtedly is a positive development. But to be effective, the United States should adopt a whole of Africa strategy rather than only a sub-Saharan strategy, especially when it comes to challenging Russian advances across the continent, given the interconnectedness between North Africa, the Sahel strip, and sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Europe: Get serious about “Europeanisation.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France has been the main prey of Russia’s forays in Africa. Anti-French sentiment and the Russian disinformation apparatus have become so entrenched in certain parts of the continent that any French-led effort to turn the tide tends to result in adverse outcomes. France has therefore opted for a transformation of its relations with Africa, presented by President Macron on February 27, 2023, as an intention to build a “new, balanced, reciprocal, and responsible relationship” underpinned by the expressed needs of African partners. This entails a reduction of France’s military personnel across the continent, following the termination of the Barkhane counterterrorism operation in Sahel late last year, and co-management with African partners of French military bases on the continent (except for the one in Djibouti dedicated to the Indo-Pacific strategy). The expectation is that reducing the focus on security and defense will move the otherwise rich Franco-African cooperation into the limelight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Europeans welcome the ongoing reorientations in France’s strategic thinking. Yet if Paris lowers its profile, this requires others to step up, both at the national and EU levels. Paris has pushed for years for Europeans to get more involved in Africa—for example through the Takuba task force in the Sahel, or more recently through the “Team Europe” coordinated initiative between member states and EU institutions resulting in trips to Ethiopia, Niger, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite genuine French efforts at coordination, the view in some European capitals has sometimes been that France looks after its own interests in Africa, and then seeks partners to share the burden. Right or wrong, this view could prove an obstacle for Paris. In the meantime, France’s unique know-how and assets, let alone francophone connections and the importance of the African diaspora in France—the largest in Europe—will remain indispensable. Paris should therefore be genuine in its effort to empower other Europeans to take on increased responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the national level, some European countries are expected to step up and seem to be willing to do so. This is the case for Germany, which has steadily increased its presence in the Sahel and recently completed its first-ever Sahel strategy. With a less visible colonial record on the continent, Germany could appear as a more acceptable partner than France in many places. Some perceived German weaknesses at the European level, such as its absence from the UN Security Council or its alleged leniency vis-à-vis Russia, could conversely prove to be assets for building confidence with Africans. But Germany will need to convince African states that it can be not only an assistance provider but also a partner for security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain also nurtures ambitions to become a strategic partner to Africa. Madrid has repeatedly voiced its interests for increased collective engagement with the Global South—notably Latin America and Africa—through EU or NATO efforts, and it will continue advocating for this cause during its presidency of the EU Council in the second half of 2023. In its recently released “Africa strategy,” Madrid pledges to send a warship to the Gulf of Guinea to fight piracy and increase security in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the United Kingdom, although not a member of the European Union, remains one of the most knowledgeable European players on Africa-related issues, as well as one of the most active and experienced actors confronting Russian threats worldwide. Despite a low interest for Africa in its Integrated Review, London heralds that it will keep prioritizing Europe’s “wider neighborhood.” Therefore, the country could become an important player in the region, should it have the political will to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, at the European level, the most recent declaration of the European Union–African Union summit held in February 2022 has committed to renewing and enhancing “cooperation for peace and security.” EU missions in Africa, which were generally assembled upon French request, have been collateral victims of Russia’s progress. The European Union seems aware of the need to change its approach and is experimenting with new forms of partnership—such as the one with Niger, in which the African country was given the lead on operations, with European supply of equipment through the European Peace Facility and growing bilateral support from several member states. Although the coup in Niger has put an end to this experiment in a very fragile state, this approach was certainly going in the right direction and could be replicated in other, more stable countries. In general, the European Peace Facility, as an instrument initially conceived of in Paris to support its own efforts in Africa (taking over the Africa Peace Facility) and later reoriented to support the Ukrainian Armed Forces, should be supported in a way to fund efforts in both theaters. The European Peace Facility has the potential to be a very competitive instrument, with due diligence carried out up front to ensure that arms are supplied into safe hands, for clear and shared objectives. Failing to do so could add to the sentiment of double standards and frustration in the relations between Africa and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

But the task of convincing the Japanese public is far from complete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white paper entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mod.go.jp/en/publ/w_paper/wp2023/DOJ2023_Digest_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;Defense of Japan 2023&lt;/a&gt;” had a difficult task, coming less than eight months after the publication of three major and headline-grabbing national security policy documents. Japan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cas.go.jp/jp/siryou/221216anzenhoshou/nss-e.pdf&quot;&gt;National Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (NSS), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mod.go.jp/j/approach/agenda/guideline/strategy/pdf/strategy_en.pdf&quot;&gt;National Defense Strategy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mod.go.jp/j/approach/agenda/guideline/plan/pdf/program_en.pdf&quot;&gt;Defense Buildup Program&lt;/a&gt;, released in December 2022, announced historically significant commitments, including a dramatic increase in defence spending, acquisition of long-range strike weapons, and a pivot in force posture to reinforce the island chain that extends from the main islands down to Taiwan. This made for a hard act to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet policymaking is only half the battle, and as Japan begins the implementation process, there are reasons to suspect that this could prove the harder part. Considerable gaps still separate the ambition from the reality. After generations of being educated in an identity as a pacifist nation and relying on the US to shoulder the main burden of Japan’s defence, Japanese society and other government departments have to be convinced of the need to provide the country with the resources to assume primary responsibility for its own defence in an era of – as the white paper diplomatically puts it – “changes to the power balance”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one indicator of this gap, we need only follow the money. The December 2022 commitments to increase the defence budget triggered a still unresolved debate on the question of finance. Initially, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida proposed to source the money through higher taxes. This partly reflected concern over Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio, which stands above 250%. Opting for tax rather than borrowing also sends a more convincing signal that the increases are sustainable. If all goes to plan, by 2027 Japan should be on track to have the third biggest defence budget in the world. However, opposition to this approach – including from inside the ruling party – caused Mr Kishida to back off. Among the competing demands on the budget is an expensive programme designed to raise the birth rate, inter alia by doubling child support. But the same demographic trends that are making it harder to hit military recruitment targets are also shrinking the tax base. The government is now reported to be considering selling off some of its stake in Japanese companies – worth over $200 billion – to help raise the money. A law was passed in June to create a defence funding pool made up of such non-tax revenues. Some combination of tax, debt and other resources now appears more likely. However, the one-off nature of non-tax solutions is a disadvantage from a strategic point of view, and Kishida’s retreat reveals how far the government still has to go to convince key constituencies of the urgency and importance of resourcing a stronger and more independently capable defence capacity. Clearly, there is more to be done on the public diplomacy front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The white paper offers a renewed effort of presentation that seems intended to bring home to the Japanese population and others the rationale for the planned build-up in defence capabilities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence white paper published on 28 July 2023 contains hardly any new information about the threats facing Japan and the capacities it needs to confront them. Rather, it offers a renewed effort of presentation that seems intended to bring home to the Japanese population and others the rationale for the planned build-up in defence capabilities that is necessary to achieve deterrence in the current context. Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada launches this narrative in the opening line of the white paper’s foreword with a bold historical assertion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The world is at a turning point in history. The international community is facing its greatest trial since World War II, and we have entered a new era of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests a greater trial than the Cold War, which was hardly “cold” at all for the region around Japan. Is Hamada’s rhetoric pure hyperbole, or is he justified in the judgement that the present era’s challenges surpass those of a period that saw an unbroken chain of Asian wars – from the Chinese civil war, the Vietnamese war of liberation and the Malay “emergency” in the 1940s, through the Korean war in the 50s, the Indonesian “confrontation” and renewed Vietnam War in the 60s, to Vietnam’s invasion of Cambodia and the China’s invasion of Vietnam that lasted until the end of the 1970s?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, we have to step into the shoes of the officials responsible for Japan’s security. From this perspective, while there was incessant violence in Asia during the Cold War, the threat to Japan itself and to the stability of the basic principles of the world order that allowed for Japan’s return to sovereignty and rise to prosperity may appear more severe now than they did then. Mr Hamada’s foreword continues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is an unprecedented situation. A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council has shown disregard for international law by launching an aggression against a sovereign country and repeating rhetoric and actions that can be interpreted as threats of nuclear weapons use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of disregard for law, naked conquest, and nuclear threats by a neighbour of Japan might seem bad enough, but it is only part of Japan’s security problems. A closer neighbour, North Korea, has not only developed nuclear weapons and long-range delivery systems (which it flies over Japan and sometimes drops into surrounding waters), but its ability to do so while under sanctions by the UN Security Council justifies doubts about the reliability of that institution itself, as well as the attitude of China to its responsibilities as a permanent member. If Beijing’s inability to acknowledge Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was not enough cause for concern, its military has taken to patrolling the seas and airspace around Japan together with Russian naval and airborne nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The combination of disregard for law, naked conquest, and nuclear threats by neighbouring Russia is only part of Japan’s security problems&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the white paper makes the following evaluations. North Korea’s military activities pose a “grave and imminent threat to Japan’s national security”. Russia’s military activities in the Indo-Pacific region, together with its strategic coordination with China, are described as of “strong security concern”. China’s current external stance, military activities, and other activities are described as “a matter of serious concern for Japan and the international community”, presenting an “unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rate of change in the security environment that justifies a shift in Japan’s defence is communicated in a special feature titled “An Era of Upheavals: 10 Years of Change”. This era begins in 2013, the year of Japan’s first NSS, and coincidentally the year Xi Jinping topped his titles of Communist Party General Secretary and Chairman of the Central Military Commission by becoming President of China. This section contains numerous upward-tilting graphs detailing the increase in threats; Japanese defence investment; and cooperation with Japan’s ally the US, “like-minded” countries, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Japan’s defence establishment has drawn two main conclusions: that there is a need to defend the country “by ourselves” (by implication not relying as much on the US), and to achieve deterrence that makes the opponent think “attacking Japan will not achieve its goals”. In material and technological terms, Japan has the wherewithal to achieve both objectives. The question is whether Japan’s population – particularly its taxpayers and would-be military recruits – can be convinced that this is a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

The graphs, maps, and tables in this report only highlight a limited range of the complex changes involved, and reliable data are often lacking for the years after 2020. They still show, however, that the civil and military role of the world’s major powers is in a process of dramatic and unpredictable change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-key-impact-of-chinas-emergence-as-a-major-global-economic-power&quot;&gt;The Key Impact of China’s Emergence as a Major Global Economic Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has emerged as an economic superpower that rivals the United States in many ways, although the total economic power of modern democracies — most of which are strategic partners of the United States — vastly exceeds the size of the Chinese economy, trade efforts, and efforts in technology and research and development. China also faces major internal challenges created by outside restrictions and economic sanctions, its handling of Covid-19, and state interference in its economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, China is already competing with the economies of developed democratic states on a global level. Its “belt and road” efforts to establish economic ties to developing states and control critical minerals and resources. It may succeed in creating a rival economic bloc that can function and grow outside the “rules-based order” democracies created after World War II, and it is already competing in its relations with a number of developing states and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trends presented in this report show that this competition may well become an ongoing confrontation between China and its allies, and developed democracies and their strategic partners, unless radical changes take place in Chinese policies and leadership. And — as is discussed shortly — is a growing level of civil confrontation that is being matched by military confrontation as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-diminished-global-economic-role&quot;&gt;Russia’s Diminished Global Economic Role&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following graphics show that Russia is not an economic superpower now that it has lost control of most East European states and many of the Central European and Asian elements of the former Soviet Union. Russia has long lagged badly in total economic growth, trade, research and development, and all the other major areas of economic power. Russia’s size, geographic position, and large oil and gas reserves do, however, still make it a key global power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-uncertainties-in-the-civil-impacts-of-economic-power&quot;&gt;Key Uncertainties in the Civil Impacts of Economic Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be stressed, however, that current trends can only tell part of the story. Any analysis of economic and civil power will be shaped by many key trends that cannot be quantified. They include the longer-term impacts of the economic stresses between and within developed states, the impact of internal politics, the impact of demographic change and population pressure, and the impact of global warming. They also include the degree to which the developed democracies can succeed in cooperating and creating truly functional economic strategic partnerships. As yet, governments often rely far more on rhetoric about such cooperation than on taking tangible action, although there are positive indicators as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphics in this analysis also do not include the developing world. Here, the allocation of international economic power has generally favored developed states. As the UN, World Bank, IMF, and a host of NGO reports make clear, many states have failed to move towards effective development and face major challenges from failed or corrupt governance, repression and internal division, population pressure, limited water supplies, and climate change. For all the former rhetoric about globalism, this includes at least one-third of the world’s nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are cases like India, where the trends in global power could move in other directions. While they are not yet positive enough to include in this analysis, India has overtaken China as the world’s most populous state, has a GDP of some $9.3 trillion, and ranks high in terms of total military spending. Several major petroleum states in the Gulf are taking positive steps to develop beyond a reliance on energy exports, as are some states in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. For all the failings in the developing world, they are also important potential successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-of-trends-in-military-power&quot;&gt;The Impact of Trends in Military Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphs and tables that follow show that the United States remains the world’s largest military power, the one with the most combat experience and highest levels of total spending and investment in modernization, and the one with the strongest strategic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also clear, however, that the United States already faces growing competition from China, particularly in the Pacific and in the Indian Ocean as well. In the case of Taiwan, competition has already turned to serious confrontation and the risk of war. Once again, China has vastly increased its capabilities since 1990, as well as its military links to other Asia power. Much depends on the United States’ ability to strengthen its strategic partnerships with Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and other Asian states — as well as European states with major power projection capabilities like Great Britain and France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uncertainties-driven-by-the-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;The Uncertainties Driven by the War in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the United States and its strategic partners face a major challenge from Russia and one that current U.S. national strategy tends to seriously understate. As the graphics show, Russia may not have an economy that can fully support its present conventional forces, but it remains a major threat to the United States’ European strategic partners and NATO, and the Russian military threat must be given equal priority with that from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trends shown in this analysis do not generally go beyond 2021 and cannot reflect the many longer-term changes in the military balance that are growing out of the war in Ukraine. It is clear, however, that the United States and its NATO allies are engaged in major proxy war, supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russia. They also are already rebuilding NATO’s overall level of extended deterrence against Russia, and doing so at a time when Vladimir Putin, Russia’s leader, has made it clear that he sees NATO as a major and continuing threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no current way to predict how the war in Ukraine will change the overall balance of military power and how and when it will end. It seems almost certain, however, that as long as Putin rules Russia, the United States and the rest of NATO will be engaged in a new Cold War, and one which will effectively match a similar Cold War between the United States and its strategic partners in Asia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-return-to-nuclear-forces&quot;&gt;A Return to Nuclear Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the final sections of this analysis also show, these two Cold Wars have a major nuclear dimension. The race to build up conventional military power is, in some ways, being outpaced by a new nuclear arms race. This race not only reflects the near collapse of nuclear arms control but a potential return to major tactical, theater, and dual-capable nuclear forces. It also is clear that Russia is now only a superpower to the extent it has inherited a massive legacy of nuclear weapons and technology from the former Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s Rising Economic Power Has Vastly Outstripped Russia and Competes with the U.S. and EU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparative Military Spending is Highly Uncertain, but the U.S. still has a Clear Lead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China has made sustained major rises since 2000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia has lagged badly since the early 1990s, but has made significant increases as a result of the Ukraine War.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/O5Ir3vB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Estimates Do, However, Reflect a Major Rise in Russian Spending Since 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The previous SIPRI data reflect a major increase from $65.9 billion 2021 to $86.4 billion in 2022, but this is not a serious rise not relative to the increases made by the U.S., China, and major NATO states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IISS report that the draft Russian 2023 budget, submitted to to the State Duma on 30 September 2022, showed that final core spending for 2022 rose from an original proposal of RUB3.50tr (USD50.0bn) to RUB4.68tr (USD66.9bn), with a corresponding rise in total military spending from RUB4.98tr (USD71.1bn) to RUB6.15tr (USD87.9bn).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reuters reports that Russia spent 2 trillion rubles ($26 billion) on defence in January and February 2023, a 282% rise over the 525.4 billion rubles in the first two months of 2022, and driven by the conflict in the Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other estimates emerging from a Google search indicate Russia’s official 2022 military budget could be 4.7 trillion rubles ($75bn), or higher, and reach $84 billion for 2023. This is 40% more than initial military budget announced in 2021. They also estimate that Russia plans to spend a total of $600 billion on military and the police between 2022–2025, or $150 billion a year&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Military Spending Has Led To a Massive Force Modernization Effort that Continues in 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rises in spite of COVID crisis, investment crisis, and other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Government fiscal revenues down 30-40% in some months of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military spending up more than 7% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Planned to increase by 7.2% in 2023&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arms Transfers Provide an Important Indicator of Comparative Strategic Influence and Security Assistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. has cancelled its report on World Military expenditures and arms transfers, and there now is no reliable declassified estimate of the actual market value of arms sales.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SIPRI does, however, provide an well structure estimate of the total value of major weapons transfers based on estimates of comparable prices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These SIPIR estimates indicate the the U.S. retains a massive lead over other providers of arms transfers and had 40% of the world total in 2018-2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia had a 16% share.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other major arms sellers were largely strategic partners of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China only had a 5.2% share, although it was increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia Only Remains a True Military Superpower in Nuclear Forces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Nuclear Capability Is Growing Sharply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seems to be more than doubling its stockpile of nuclear weapons. May have risen from around 200 to 350 by 2020. 272 operational for exiting missiles and bombs and 78 for new systems. Possibly grew by 118 warheads during 2020-2021. Estimates for 2023 are 410 weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have detected 270+ new missile silos. 119 in Northwestern China seem to be for ICBMs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chinese Military Power estimates China may have some 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030, most deployed on systems capable of ranging the continental United States”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China has rejected arms control initiatives and provides steadily less transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is improving nuclear command and control and battle management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deploying advanced solid-fuel mobile ICBMs (DF-21 &amp;amp; DF-31/DF-31A/DF-32AG), MIRV’d liquid fuel ICBM (DF-5B), new MIRV’d DF-41 ICBM, Type 094 SSBN with JL-2 SLBMs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing low noise 096 SSBNs and a 9,000 kilometer range 096 SLBM.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Progressively harder to determine what theater and short-range delivery systems may become dual-capable. DF-21 MRBM (2,150 KM) and DF-26 IRBM (4,000 KM) known to be nuclear. DF-21 is precision strike, dual-capable and could deliver low-yield nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modifying H-6 nuclear bombers to H-6N with refueling, missile carrying capability. H-20 stealth bomber in development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;May be evolving far beyond countervalue second strike capability. Examining use as theater warfare threat?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The ultimate in disposing one’s troops is to be without ascertainable shape. Then the most penetrating spies cannot pry in nor can the wise lay plans against you. It is according to the shapes that I lay plans for victory, but the multitude does not comprehend this. Although everyone can see the outward aspects, none understands the way in which I have created victory.” (Sun Tzu)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;柯耀林選舉經理作供 指柯曾令不可提「光時」、港獨及「攬炒」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（14日）踏入審訊第105天。參選新東的區政聯盟前召集人兼前西貢區議員柯耀林，今傳召選舉經理陳展浚作供，陳稱區政聯盟為鬆散的組織，成員團體互不代表和從屬，而柯曾考慮參選新界東和超級區議會，但於超區協調會議看到有岑敖暉後，認為岑知名度很高、他參選超區無任何空間，終決定參選新東。陳並指，柯只曾出席首次新東協調會議但早走、缺席第二次協調會議，亦無收過任何協調文件，而他無向組織者查詢會上內容，因認為組織者有責任就重要事項主動通知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又表示，曾為柯發布「墨落無悔」聲明帖文，而柯自2019年區選便命令團隊不可於宣傳材料提及「光復香港 時代革命」和支持港獨，初選時亦不容出現「攬炒」二字，指他們團隊均認為如癱瘓政府運作，「香港會何去何從呢？癱瘓咗又點樣呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方傳區政聯盟執委柯耀林助理作供&quot;&gt;辯方傳區政聯盟執委、柯耀林助理作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成上周作供完畢，新東餘下3名被告林卓廷、梁國雄及柯耀林均不作供，只有柯耀林傳召一名辯方證人。辯方大律師唐樂山今傳召曾任柯助理和選舉經理的陳展浚作供，陳確認於2012年任民主黨實習生、被分配到將軍澳工作時認識時為民主黨黨員的柯耀林，同年柯排劉慧卿名單參與立法會選舉。陳於2013年加入民主黨、2016年退黨，柯亦於2018年退黨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡關注陳如何知道，陳指因當時在柯耀林與林卓廷爭拗的風波中，柯帶領59人退黨，「我中間係有參與全程個過程同埋規劃」；並確認柯於2017年從馬來西亞返港，為2019年區議會選舉準備時，他已成為柯的助理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;助理稱柯要求定期更新區議會事務及政治發展&quot;&gt;助理稱柯要求定期更新區議會事務及政治發展&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳確認，柯於2004至2011年任西貢廣明區議員，並於2019年再度當選，其後他正式成為柯的議員助理。陳指柯並非全職區議員，他同時是一間物業管理公司的全職營運總監、廣明苑業主立案法團主席，亦是將軍澳民生關注組主席和區政聯盟召集人；而陳與柯每日會通電話，如時間許可一星期至少有三晚一起吃飯和開會，至初選期間陳任柯的選舉經理，基本上每日見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PUWh3H3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，柯會在平日晚上和周末處理區議會事務、與市民會面，而因柯「工作真係好繁忙」，故要求他們定期甚至每天向他更新區議會事務和政治發展，柯每天與他通電話時亦會問及，但陳「有冇同佢講、講漏咗佢都唔會知道」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區政聯盟會章提一國兩制原則下爭取民主&quot;&gt;區政聯盟會章提一國兩制原則下爭取民主&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳展浚同意，柯耀林自2000年就是將軍澳民生關注組成員，初選期間任該組織主席；陳則是組織召集人，組織主要關注將軍澳地區工作和參與西貢區議會的選舉和議會事務，但並非政黨，只是跨民主派政黨地區組織，成員包括獨立人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳並指，將軍澳民生關注組與沙田區政、大埔及北區團隊，為區政聯盟的三大團體成員，聯盟很多成員是從民主黨和新民主同盟離開，而陳是執委會成員，其有份草擬的會章第一條為「在一國兩制大原則下，爭取民主、維護自由、捍衛法治，團結社區力量，為香港市民服務」，亦規定只能以團體成員身分加入。惟陳表示，2020年3月區政聯盟進行改組，不再以團體形式運作、要以個人身分加入，主要是應付沙田區政有逾半成員退出的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;助理稱區政聯盟為共享資源成立-組織鬆散成員團體互不代表及從屬&quot;&gt;助理稱區政聯盟為「共享資源」成立 組織鬆散、成員團體互不代表及從屬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳並指，不論改組前後，「理論上」都是由執委會管理聯盟事務，但2019年區議會選舉後，執委會無再開過一次正式會議，故改組時無即時修改會章，至2021年才修改。法官李運騰一度指，若然如此改組便違反會章，陳指「唔可以咁講」，因他們有「追認」並將「團體」字眼改為「個人」。李一度說：「這對我來說在法律上完全不合理。（“None of that makes any legal sense to me.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續確認，區政聯盟是一個組織鬆散的組織，基本上三大團體就代表三大地區，「有自己完全嘅自主性，我哋互不代表，互不從屬。」辯方問若組織如此鬆散，為何會存在？陳指組織成立是望為2019年區議會選舉和2020年立法會選舉「共享資源」，「只不過希望有一個共同嘅組織名義。」李運騰問，那會章第一條是否組織真正的目的？陳同意，並指區政聯盟支持者來自區議員「樁腳」，票源與民主黨和新民主同盟高度重疊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;助理稱獲鍾錦麟告知有初選柯參加初選主要目的為得知支持度&quot;&gt;助理稱獲鍾錦麟告知有初選、柯參加初選主要目的為得知支持度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就參加初選的經過，陳展浚指於2020年3至4月時，時任西貢區議會主席兼前民主動力副召集人、新民主同盟的鍾錦麟，詢問他們有否意欲參加初選和選舉協調，他即時通知柯耀林。陳並解釋，在西貢區議會中，將軍澳民生關注組與新民主同盟「衝突都幾大」，主要透過他和鍾作雙方溝通區議會和選舉協調事務的渠道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，柯當時有表達對參加初選的興趣，「因為無論有冇初選，我哋都計劃必然參與2020年嘅立法會選舉」，又指據過往經驗，一名候選人參加初選需30至50萬選舉經費，參與正式選舉至少需150至200萬，若直接參加直選，「柯生好大機會要按樓」；故參與初選最主要目的是望做民調以知道柯的支持度，如支持度低就不參與直選，可「慳返啲錢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，柯並非區政聯盟唯一一個考慮出選的候選人，初期考慮出選的還包括大埔及北區團隊的區鎮樺，以及沙田區政的丁仕元和李永成。被問柯對參選哪區有興趣，陳指「其實唔係主要佢有興趣，係其他人希望佢出選超區」，而將軍澳民生關注組則想他參選新界東；陳指柯本人對兩區均持開放態度，視乎其他人如何商討和決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;助理稱柯首次新東協調會議早走因西貢區議會開會缺席第二次會議&quot;&gt;助理稱柯首次新東協調會議早走、因西貢區議會開會缺席第二次會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就4月14日的首次新東協調會議，陳展浚指柯耀林有出席但早走，並於離開後即時致電他，指會議中段開始「有啲人因為一啲恩怨不斷喺度爭拗」，故離場並約陳於將軍澳共膳。陳指當晚9時看到柯，柯稱會議達成一些共識，包括辦投票而非民調、「贏咗初選有得選，輸咗冇得」、新東出線名額為「6+1」。法官指柯的說話屬傳聞證供，辯方指並非依賴其說話真實性，只是作為背景。陳並確認柯當時未決定參選超區抑或新東，當時「靜觀其變」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，據他所知區鎮樺也有出席首次會議，區並通知柯5月5日第二次新東會議，但柯終無出席，因西貢區議會當晚開會到晚上10時。辯方展示會議出席紀錄，陳確認當天列席，而鍾錦麟和柯耀林均由約早上9時半開會至晚上10時40分。陳指因當天大埔區議會亦超時，故區鎮樺也無出席第二次會議，他事後從新聞報導得知李永成有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指他無問李永成會上發生何事，因李也有意出選新界東，「大家係內部競爭關係，唔係好方便」；而當時亦「冇呢個意識去問」組織者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;助理稱柯曾出席超區協調會議-因岑敖暉知名度高遂不考慮超區&quot;&gt;助理稱柯曾出席超區協調會議 因岑敖暉知名度高遂不考慮超區&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，柯當時未決定參選新東抑或超區，並於5月14日出席超區協調會議。柯事後告訴陳，看到岑敖暉出席會議，認為岑「知名度好高」，「佢覺得計過數，超級區議會冇任何空間」，故不再考慮參選超級區議會；而柯於初選截止提名前兩三日才決定參選新界東。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;助理稱無收過協調文件無查詢因認為組織者有責任主動通知&quot;&gt;助理稱無收過協調文件、無查詢因認為組織者有責任主動通知&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，他無從組織者、柯耀林及區政聯盟收到任何有關協調會議共識和協議的文件和草稿。法官陳仲衡問，他們無出席第二次會議、亦無從組織者收到文件，不會想從組織者知道會上發生何事嗎？陳說：「如果係有重要嘅事項，協調者係有責任主動通知我哋，即使我哋冇出席。」李運騰指，但當時柯耀林並無表明會參選新界東，陳仍認為組織者有責任就重要決定通知他們？陳說：「係，因為無論邊個出選，區政聯盟都好大機會派人出選。」法官陳慶偉追問，為何陳會認為組織者有責任通知潛在初選參與者，陳展浚重申因區政聯盟「明顯係好大機會會參與直選，咁所以佢都係需要接觸返我哋，如果我哋冇出席，係要話返畀我哋聽究竟係咪有任何決定」，聯盟只是未定出選人選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指認為區政聯盟應問組織者，因他們不想在無勝算的正式選舉花百多萬，並再追問為何當時無興趣向組織者查詢。陳展浚指因認為其中一個組織者鍾錦麟也知道他們因區議會事務缺席第二次會議，如該次會議內容「真係咁重要，佢會通知我哋，佢冇同我哋講，我哋就唔問」。陳仲衡指，但鍾當天也同於西貢區議會開會，不知道協調會議發生何事，陳展浚說：「咁可能佢哋民主動力事後有溝通。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VMTLFgl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鍾錦麟（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續說，因此陳是說，區政聯盟樂意將所有責任推給其他人、自己則不用承擔任何責任？陳說：「誒法官閣下，我唔知你點樣理解，我只係將事實去講返出嚟嘅啫。」陳慶偉追問他的理解與陳展浚理解是否一致？陳說只能說他們頗依賴組織者主動提供最新發展，「如果你覺得我哋呢方面做得不足，呢個都係事實嚟嘅，因為我哋的確係一個幾鬆散嘅組織」；又指他們只是出席了第一次會議，「理解嘅嘢就係咁多」，組織者之後無任何更新，再找他們已是有關票站事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，因此柯報名參選新東前，只曾出席第一次協調會議的頭半部分，並缺席第二次會議，亦從沒有從組織者收到任何文件，實際上他對協調會議上說過的事知道很少？陳同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;助理稱柯耀林曾令團隊不可有光時港獨及攬炒&quot;&gt;助理稱柯耀林曾令團隊不可有「光時」、港獨及「攬炒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就柯耀林 Facebook 發布的「墨落無悔」發問，陳指柯的 Facebook 專頁除了柯外，還有約十人包括他管理，施德來和陳志全聞言面露驚訝和發笑。陳並指，帖文基本上由團隊其他人撰寫，柯不會撰文，但重要的帖文會由柯看過後才發布，涉地區事務的則未必全部看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦確認，就柯所有選舉宣傳材料包括片段和單張，均由團隊成員草擬，陳審批和最終修改，再交柯做最終決定和修改。至於柯曾否就相關內容作出指示，陳指由2019年區議會選舉開始，柯便命令全個將軍澳民生關注組、包括其團隊，「唔可以有『光復香港 時代革命』口號，同埋係支持港獨嘅」，而「初選期間都唔容許有『攬炒』呢兩個字出現」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問柯曾否定義「攬炒」，陳稱他們無很詳細定義，但柯與他們整個將軍澳團隊的看法，也是：「如果癱瘓政府嘅運作嘅話，香港會何去何從呢？癱瘓咗又點樣呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，柯 Facebook 的「墨落無悔」聲明是由他發布，事前他有與柯於 WhatsApp 討論。辯方明將展示相關紀錄，案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（11日）踏入審訊第104天。鄒家成繼續接受盤問，表示戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議只是發起「墨落無悔」的「導火線」，刺激他們思考「要簽啲乜嘢」去展現抗爭意志，但他們並非想製作一份以協調會議為基礎的協議、聲明無寫上會議已達成共識的項目，「墨落」中會運用否決權迫特首回應五大訴求、及支持度不足須停止選舉工程兩點聲明，均是具爭議或暫時未有共識。法官陳慶偉問，發起「墨落無悔」是否填補戴耀廷留下的空白（fill the gap of Benny Tai）？鄒不同意。而就主控萬德豪指，鄒發起「墨落」是想集結人一起否決預算案，鄒說：「萬專員，我哋之間係唔係有咩誤會呀？唔同意」，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，張可森當時加上「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」，是承上啟下，諷刺戴耀廷「講咗嘅嘢唔算數」及帶出「墨落」兩點聲明；亦「畫龍點睛」，精要之處在「選民」，強調參選人如反悔要接受選民問責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議與墨落無悔僅導火線未必有密切因果關係&quot;&gt;鄒稱戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議與「墨落無悔」僅導火線、未必有密切因果關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成第6日作供，今續接受控方盤問。開庭前，有旁聽親友向鄒家成說：「今日最後一日」，鄒說「希望係啦」，有親友回應：「加油呀捱埋今日呀。」甫開庭，鄒笑着向主控萬德豪問：「Mr. Man, you don’t need Monday right?」林卓廷等發笑，萬德豪笑問：「Why are you asking me?」鄒答：「我會全力配合。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方盤問焦點，在於鄒家成等人發起的「墨落無悔」聲明，是否戴耀廷原擬要求參選人簽署的協調會議共識。控方先引鄒家成2020年6月與張可森和梁晃維的訪問發問，被問「點解發起抗爭聲明」時，鄒表示：「一路開幾次會都話係有一個共同綱領大家要簽，但喺無通知我哋嘅情況底下，跟住就開咗個記招跟住就話唔需要簽，嗰陣先知原來係唔需要簽。我哋第一個感覺就話我哋要簽返啲嘢喎，唔可以畀泛民主派單方面去撕毀約章。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒同意，他提及「一路開幾次會」是指新東協調會議。陳慶偉指理解鄒說法亦是指向其他兩人，鄒否認，並重申訪問前「我哋冇夾過」，3人均是「自說自話」，記者問題也是「當場先知」。李運騰提到，而鄒提到的感受，是其他兩人也有的感覺？鄒說根據當時討論，「我估佢哋應該都有呢個感覺」，追問下稱「我相信嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就訪問提到要簽「共同綱領」，鄒同意是指「已達成共識的共同綱領」，而提到不想被泛民撕毀約章，是想就已達成的共識簽署。萬問，因此3人發起「墨落無悔」？鄒認為「未必有一個好密切嘅因果關係」，指戴稱毋須簽文件的說法只是發起「墨落」的背景和「導火線（triggering point）」，刺激他們思考要簽什麼文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱無將4點協調共識放墨落-因無助展現抗爭意志&quot;&gt;鄒稱無將4點協調共識放「墨落」 因無助展現抗爭意志&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續說，而「墨落」不一定反映協調會議已同意的事項，可能「更進一步」？鄒同意，指「因為我哋唔係想整一個以協調會議為基礎嘅協議呀嘛」，故聲明「其實冇寫一啲已達成共識嘅項目喺度」。李提到，但聲明提及「最大公因數」，「墨落」兩點聲明（即會運用否決權，及如支持度不足會停止選舉工程），是否就是「最大公因數」？鄒否認，指辦初選、辦論壇、「贏咗有得選，輸咗冇得選」、及以靈童制為替補機制4點共識，才是他們討論時「搵到五區嘅最大公因數」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並強調，沒有將上述4點放進「墨落」，「因為對我嚟講一件事還一件事」，發起「墨落」目的就是想「展現抗爭意志」和「保障返一啲政治素人」。鄒指他的確同意想簽一份由初選籌組平台提供的文件，因這是他參加兩次新東會議後的想法；不過當戴稱毋須簽，就刺激他們思考「我哋需要簽啲乜嘢去展現我哋嘅抗爭意志」，經討論後得出兩點聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪再問，鄒認為「墨落」是一個好機會，讓他放進4點共識讓人們簽署嗎？鄒說不會，「因為嗰4點係無助於展現抗爭意志嘅，我覺得一般市民大眾根本就唔 care 嗰4點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指張可森擬墨落理應無悔一句-諷刺戴耀廷講咗嘅嘢唔算數&quot;&gt;鄒指張可森擬「墨落理應無悔」一句 諷刺戴耀廷「講咗嘅嘢唔算數」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落」提到「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」，鄒引張可森指這是「畫龍點眼」的說法，精要之處在於「選民」兩字，張想強調「墨落」是面向公眾的聲明，「要接受問責嘅對象係選民，而唔係我哋三個或者其他參選人」。萬德豪說任何公開聲明也是面向公眾，鄒說：「所以佢想畫龍點睛加呢句說話囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續主動交代背景，「畀大家再了解多啲個 picture」，指「墨落」初稿標題原只是「本土派立場聲明書」，但張可森「想昇華成個聲明，叫我哋畀啲時間佢再諗多一個標題」，終加上「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭」，並改為「抗爭派立場聲明書」，內文亦加入「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」一句。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，「點睛」之處是運用否決權迫使特首回應五大訴求？鄒指「墨落」兩點聲明當然是重點，但重申精要之處在「選民」。李運騰問，即鄒想透過聲明告訴選民他們進入立法會會做的事？鄒說：「我同意㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續說，但看到聲明的選民並不會知道參與者之間達成過的協議，根本不存在「失信」，鄒重申「之前協調會議達成咗嘅共識係唔重要嘅……選民根本冇興趣知道嗰4點」，而「墨落理應無悔」一句主要指參選人簽了「墨落」並同意聲明中的兩點，如最後違反承諾就等於「失信於選民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指如那是真的，該句便應附在提及兩點聲明的第三段。鄒指因此他曾提過據張可森說法，該句是「過渡句」，「佢話想產生一個承上啟下同畫龍點睛嘅作用」，張一方面想「承上」諷刺戴耀廷「講咗嘅嘢唔算數」，另一方面想「啟下」談及兩點聲明，「佢有佢嘅堅持啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指草擬聲明時亦考慮該點是否具爭議-指會運用否決權重要亦具爭議&quot;&gt;鄒指草擬聲明時亦考慮該點是否具爭議 指會運用否決權重要亦具爭議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒在盤問下續指，協調會議4點共識對選民不重要，是因無助展現抗爭意志，但認為辦初選和論壇、及贏輸機制是對參選人重要，至於靈童制他則不太重視。陳慶偉打斷指，認為靈童制對參選人和選民重要，指黃之鋒於九東會議就此爭論，如他投選黃之鋒，也想知道誰是他的 Plan B；陳亦認為贏輸機制對選民重要，舉例若他投票予萬德豪，而萬落敗仍參加正式選舉，他一定不會投選他。陳又主動提到「三投三不投」，指如果贏輸機制不重要，「吳政亨為什麼要花這麼多錢在《蘋果日報》賣廣告？要賣給誰看？《蘋果日報》的目標讀者是誰？是公眾！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒說「嗱我初選真係唔識佢（吳政亨）㗎」，又笑着回應，「其實我同意你講嘅嘢，我啱啱已經準備講你啱啱講嘅嘢喇」，被告和旁聽席發笑。鄒並指討論以靈童制抑或排名制作替補機制時，大家都不想被DQ後自己主張的理念無人繼承，舉例如他被DQ，用排名制便會由范國威代表他，但「支持我嘅人未必係會投畀佢范國威嘅」。鄒續指對他而言，靈童制「我覺得係常識嚟㗎喇」，新東亦幾乎無爭拗，在2016年立法會選舉亦已開始使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又重申，沒有將靈童制寫進「墨落」，是因屬五區共同共識，並指「我喺 set 一個聲明嘅時候，決定咩 point 呢，除咗係覺得能夠展現抗爭意志呢個考慮之外，亦都有具爭議性或者當時未有共識嘅考慮」。陳仲衡問，鄒是指因戴耀廷未能就參與者同意的事項提供聲明簽署，故3人決定就未取得共識的事項發布聲明？鄒說：「呢個真係我哋當時討論個次序。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉表示明白，但若然如此為何不在聲明表明：戴耀廷曾提出就已同意的事項簽協議但食言、而這不重要，重要的是有未取得共識的事項，而發起人望邀請人就此簽署。鄒說：「我覺得交代咗喎，你啱啱講嘅嘢都正正係我哋嘅諗法嚟。」陳慶偉問，因此「墨落」是一份補充文件，補充（complement）共同綱領？鄒重申，原本達成的共識是「墨落」的背景，而會運用否決權一點有很大爭議性，他們三人亦覺得重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒不同意墨落是嘗試填補戴耀廷留下的空白&quot;&gt;鄒不同意「墨落」是嘗試填補戴耀廷留下的空白&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問到，梁晃維於訪問稱：「既然如果戴教授佢唔希望好似送上一個魔鬼嘅祝福，令到好多人被DQ嘅話，咁就不如我哋作為有意參選人 take up 返嗰個責任，所以就會有呢個聲明書出現」，問是否指因戴耀廷不想簽署文件，故3人發聲明就是承擔製造DQ風險的責任？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒重申，戴稱不想製造「DQ紅書」，故三人決定發起一個自願性質的聲明，讓參選人自行承擔被DQ風險。陳慶偉續問，即3人嘗試填補戴留下的空白（「fill the gap of Benny Tai」，即頂替戴無做的事）？鄒不同意，亦不同意會予聲明讀者此印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱草擬墨落時將項目分成有共識及具爭議或暫未有共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱草擬「墨落」時將項目分成有共識、及具爭議或暫未有共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒盤問下續指，不知道新西和港島有否就否決財案達成共識。萬德豪問他有無興趣知道？鄒說「其實都唔係話咁有興趣」，旁聽發笑。鄒續提到討論草擬「墨落」時，曾將協調會議上討論過的項目分成兩個類別，有如「兩個籃」，一個是「最大公因數」，即已達成共識的事項；另一個是「具爭議性」或「暫時未有共識」的項目。而當時他帶領以新東協調會議為藍本一起討論，並第一時間說明第二次新東會議的爭拗，將否決預算案「揼咗落去具爭議性呢個籃度」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪追問他不想知道新西和港島會議的事？鄒指因當時主要想梳理兩個籃內有什麼，「既然我搵到喇，咁我哋就冇再進一步去討論，即係份『墨落無悔』趕住出街呀。」鄒並指，其後找出辦初選等4點共識，放進有共識一籃。至於就「我認同若支持度跌出各區預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」一點，則放進「暫時未有共識」一籃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱出線人數未達共識-故停止選舉工程一點寫得較籠統&quot;&gt;鄒稱出線人數未達共識 故停止選舉工程一點寫得較「籠統」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒解釋，雖然這點在新東無爭議，但梁晃維當時提到港島「好煩好複雜」，出線人數未傾好、「又無啦啦話有四票」；張可森則稱九西連目標議席亦未傾好，亦有區指要「n（目標議席）+1」或「n+2」，故他們終將該點聲明「寫得籠統少少」，讓其他區參選人未來仍有一個商討的空間。他們亦認為該點「幾重要」，因是保障政治素人，故也放進「墨落無悔」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉指，如這是鄒的關注，聲明卻無提及出線名單數目、或該數目如何決定。鄒同意沒寫明，解釋因當時有數個區連出線人數和目標議席都未達共識，故只寫上「可得議席範圍」；亦因有選區會於初選後再討論出線名單，遂故意無寫上棄選的時間點，以讓簽署人跟從該區得出的結果。鄒又強調，棄選機制是初選邏輯，亦保障本土政治素人，「可能因為我哋三個都係政治素人，我哋睇到個重要性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指他明白該點精神如「三投三不投」，及對素人的重要性，但再指如鄒關注出線名單數，為何不在聲明寫明，又指三人當時應在想戴耀廷遺漏了一個重要的事項，「重要到認為你們要填補空白！」鄒回應，認為各區協調會議並非沒有處理棄選機制，而在可見的未來亦不是會沒有共識，他認為聲明已清晰交代，至於法官指議席數目不清晰、沒有寫明「6 6 4 4 3」，「係因為其他區都仲傾緊吖嘛」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指，控方的立場就是，這兩點其實就是參與者達成最重要的共識，所以鄒家成3人才決定將這兩點放進「墨落」，但鄒說有關目標議席未有共識，故是測試鄒的邏輯，問鄒是否明白，惟鄒搖頭，亦指沒有要再解釋的事項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落無悔非35計劃參選人共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落無悔」非「35+計劃」參選人共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就鄒早前稱「墨落無悔」與「35+計劃」無關，萬問若然如此，鄒實可自己發表聲明，無需叫其他人簽署一份聯合聲明？鄒回應：「我係可以有呢個選項，但我冇選擇呢個選項。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬指鄒沒有這樣做，是因為想集結其他人一同在立會過半後否決財政預算案？鄒望着萬說：「萬專員，我哋之間係唔係有咩誤會呀？」引來哄堂大笑，鄒續說「唔同意」。萬再問，「墨落無悔」的內容，是否「35+計劃」參選人達成的共識？鄒說「不是」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（11日）踏入審訊第104天。鄒家成繼續接受盤問，表示五大訴求中最重視雙普選，但若政府回應除雙普選以外的四個訴求，他也會接受，指爭取訴求需要長時間、五大訴求並非一步登天：「袋住先啦！爭取雙普選真係唔係一時三刻做到。」控方質疑鄒是「妥協」，鄒不同意，並指若政府不回應五大訴求，只是給予「甜頭」來「氹」議員投贊成票，此情況下投贊成才屬妥協；但在這情況下，他仍會對預算案投反對票，強調「有回應（五大訴求）先至有得傾」，亦同意張可森稱「抗爭就係不容妥協嘅藝術」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒今完成6日作供，步入囚室前頻頻向旁聽和律師席抱拳致謝。新東餘下3名被告林卓廷、梁國雄及柯耀林均不出庭作供，柯耀林一方將傳召一名辯方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張可森曾發文稱新西與會者同意會運用否決權-鄒指沒看過&quot;&gt;張可森曾發文稱新西與會者同意會運用否決權 鄒指沒看過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成繼續接受盤問。他在盤問下同意，知道張可森和梁晃維有 Facebook，但「未 friend 到成日睇」，對他們有關初選的帖文也未必有興趣。控方續展示張可森6月11日、即「墨落」發布後翌日的帖文，提到與鄒和梁晃維一同發起「墨落」，及新西協調會議上所有人都逐一表明，同意「會運用立法會權員的權力，包括否決財政預算案，要求政府落實五大訴求」。鄒指沒有看過該帖文，亦無獲張告知，他亦無出席過新西協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱政府回應五大訴求才有得傾即使有甜頭亦不妥協&quot;&gt;鄒稱政府回應五大訴求才「有得傾」、即使有「甜頭」亦不妥協&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就張可森於3名發起人的訪問提及，「香港而家討論緊嘅唔係政治，唔係咩妥協嘅藝術，唔係開天殺價、落地還錢，唔係我哋一開始話攬炒，然後佢回一回價我哋又唔攬炒」，鄒指理解張意思是不會看到預算案「派吓錢、或者講吓起醫院咁樣」就會「妥協」。萬德豪指張意思是3人一開始就想「攬炒」？鄒指應無此意思，張亦無向他解釋過如何看「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引張提及，「我哋香港而家討論緊嘅係抗爭，即係如果政治係妥協嘅藝術，抗爭就係不容妥協嘅藝術」，鄒同意其說法。萬追問，即不會妥協、不會談判（negotiate）？鄒說要視乎如何看「妥協」，並指理解張可森稱不容妥協意思是，如果政府在財政預算案可能「畀咗啲甜頭」予立法會議員或民眾、但不回應五大訴求，「我都係投反對票㗎喇」；而「除非你回應咗五大訴求啦、除非你喺 budget 度畀我睇到你有回應啦，有回應先至有得傾囉」，鄒亦同意張的看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問若只回應部分訴求會否談判-鄒稱視乎政府是否有心推動&quot;&gt;被問若只回應部分訴求會否談判 鄒稱視乎政府是否「有心推動」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬問，而即使政府只回應一個或兩個訴求，鄒亦會同意與政府談判？鄒指，「最重要係睇政府個態度係咪有心去推動」，指看過財政預算案、與政府官員有對話，「傾完之後其實你都大概有個了解㗎喇，呢個過程我覺得都係一個談判過程。」鄒又指，如果政府不回應五大訴求，用其他方法「氹啲立法會議員去投贊成票」，此情況下投贊成便屬「妥協」，故張稱「抗爭係不容妥協」，是指「爭取五大訴求係唔可以妥協」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬指，但如果政府無回應雙普選，鄒會滿意嗎？鄒承認五大訴求中最重視爭取雙普選，但「真係要好整體睇吓政府如何回應」，亦「真係好難逐個逐個訴求抽走再問我點樣睇」。鄒又指要視乎回應時間：「我假設去到十年之後，其實啲示威者都坐完監咁濟㗎喇，咁要求政府釋放示威者仲有冇意義呢？所以其實係好複雜㗎答呢條問題」，並指除了政府已回應的兩個訴求（撤回逃犯條例和6.12暴動定性），餘下三個訴求中（釋放所有示威者、成立獨立調查委員會及雙普選）「雙普選係應該要堅持到底嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱若政府僅不回應雙普選會袋住先-控方質疑屬妥協惟鄒否認&quot;&gt;鄒稱若政府僅不回應雙普選會「袋住先」 控方質疑屬「妥協」惟鄒否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，如果在2021年預算案，政府願回應除雙普選以外的四個訴求，鄒會滿意嗎？鄒說：「我會呀。」萬追問：「你會？你會接受？」鄒再說「我會呀」，指「因為爭取訴求係需要長時間」，重申爭取五大訴求「唔係要一步登天，背後更重要嘅精神係，一種鍥而不捨、繼續爭取嘅精神，所以要逐步逐步嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬追問，即使對鄒來說，雙普選是最重要的訴求？鄒笑言：「袋住先啦！」多人發笑，鄒續說：「爭取雙普選真係唔係一時三刻做到嘅，要搞諮詢都要時間。」法官李運騰續指，但由當選至政府翌年發表預算案，只有很短、以月計的時間，鄒同意。萬續問，那鄒認為他所說的是妥協嗎？鄒再重申：「我唔同意喎，因為我爭取緊五大訴求吖嘛。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續引張可森提及：「當你簽咗呢張嘢（「墨落無悔」）應承咗嘅時候，你絕對唔可以反悔，唔可以話我哋政治就係妥協㗎嘞，所以我哋一開始開個價咁高希望可以落返嚟」，惟鄒說：「佢冇講爭取五大訴求要一步登天喎，Mr. Man。」萬再問，那鄒曾否告知選民他不是要一步登天？鄒指沒有，指他甚少與選民就五大訴求溝通，他在初選期間「主要都係宣揚香港民族理念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒重申運用否決權無達共識-墨落無悔並非重申立場&quot;&gt;鄒重申運用否決權無達共識 「墨落無悔」並非「重申」立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦再質疑「墨落無悔」是協調會議共識。就3名發起人在6月19日向組織者發出的訊息，提到當時共39位以上參與者以個人或政黨名義簽署，並指「初選原設共同綱領，有意以『運用包括否決財政預算案之基本法賦予的立法會權力，迫使特首回應五大訴求。』的素人以及政黨因此共同目標而集結」。萬德豪問「共同目標」是否否決預算案。鄒指應是按「墨落」的結果理解，即有39人因為「墨落」的第一點聲明而「集結」簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬亦指訊息提到「初選原設共同綱領」，鄒解釋是指協調會議原本有討論過否決權議題，但中間有些拗撬，最後有39個人或政黨同意。法官陳仲衡指，但似乎整段也是談及戴耀廷記者會稱毋須簽協議之前的事，鄒不同意，指「如果唔係唔會出到『墨落無悔』39個人嘅結果出嚟啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，而訊息提到「在戴教授決定參與者毋須簽署共同綱領後，雖然大部份參與者有簽署『抗爭派立場聲明書』重申自己堅定的立場」，故「墨落」是「重申」運用否決權的立場？鄒問控方是否指參與者原本一直同意會運用否決權一點，而他們有「墨落」後簽署，故是「重申」立場，萬同意。鄒說：「我只能夠講，我個人上，我由持至終都係支持嘅」，而他不是代表其他簽署者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱不獲發新東協議文件癱瘓議會不包括解散立會&quot;&gt;鄒稱不獲發新東協議文件、「癱瘓議會」不包括解散立會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續確認，就「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」文件，「冇發過畀我。」萬續問鄒是否沒有反對協議內容，惟法官陳慶偉指鄒沒收過文件。萬指這是控方案情，林卓廷說「吓」。李運騰續指若證人已否認，控方沒有基礎繼續提問，但引文件提及首7張名單參與官方選舉，問是否有達成共識，鄒同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就鄒家成於新東初選民間論壇提到，每個代議士都應有心理準備「用任何手段，癱瘓每一個議會嘅進行」，鄒指不包括解散立法會。萬續指，而鄒當時知道否決預算案，特首可解散立法會？鄒說：「《基本法》係咁寫，」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後指出案情，指鄒家成與其他被告串謀取得立法會主導權，無差別否決預算案，迫使特首或政府回應五大訴求，並意圖顛覆國家政權，鄒表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒作供完畢-林卓廷梁國雄柯耀林不出庭作供&quot;&gt;鄒作供完畢 林卓廷、梁國雄、柯耀林不出庭作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示盤問完結，大律師陳世傑指沒有覆問，亦不會傳召證人，辯方案情完結。鄒完成6日作供，在懲教陪同下步回被告欄，一度向旁聽席微笑戚眉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷的大律師沈士文及代表梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸其後分別表示，林卓廷和梁國雄均選擇不作供亦沒有證人。代表柯耀林的大律師唐樂山則指，柯選擇不作供，但會傳召一名事實證人，意味新東案情將完結。法官李運騰笑指：「我必須說這星期的尾聲有些驚喜（surprises）。」案件押至下周一（11日）續審，除柯耀林外，尚餘參選超區的李予信和衞生服務界余慧明未開展辯方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，鄒不住向旁聽親友揮手，又指向自己做睡覺手勢，步入囚室時又不停雙手抱拳作揖，向旁聽人士和律師道謝。&lt;/p&gt;

From a military perspective, this is the kind of reconnaissance any capable nation would engage in against a potential opponent to identify targets and possibly prepare them for cyberattack. What was misleading in these reports is that critical infrastructure in Guam was not the primary target. The primary targets, particularly those that would support U.S. forces in any engagement over Taiwan, are located in the United States. China is engaged in a major cyber reconnaissance effort against them. If China is willing to accept the risk of broadening a conflict over Taiwan, it may decide that cyber actions against civilian infrastructure in the United States could usefully disrupt communications and the flow of material needed for military operations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese decisionmaking on the use of offensive cyber operations against civilian critical infrastructure will be shaped less by the likelihood of detection and attribution and more by a desire to manage escalation and retaliation. China may decide not to use wide-scale cyber disruption and reserve its efforts for espionage. A decision on how and where to use cyberattacks will also be shaped by the progress (or lack thereof) in any Chinese offense; a lack of success could lead to more aggressive cyber actions. The broad calculus for China’s decisionmaking will likely involve weighing the relative military advantage gained from cyberattacks on critical infrastructure against the probability that such attacks would provoke a harsh U.S. response or expand the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of China’s decisions will be shaped by resource constraints. Cyberattacks are often tailored for specific vulnerabilities and targets have a greater chance of success but take time (usually a few months) to develop. Even China faces limits on skilled personnel. These two factors suggest some prioritization of targets for cyberattack. A Chinese priority list of targets will be shaped by a balance between the likely military payoff and the political risk of expanded conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This estimate assumes that China does not engage in reconnaissance of targets unless it is considering attacking them. It is also based on Russian and U.S. practice in using offensive cyber actions against opponents’ critical infrastructures during invasion. China’s Strategic Support Force, created in 2015, combines space, cyber, electronic, and information operation capabilities. Published Chinese military doctrines discuss the central role of informatized warfare, the importance of the cyber domain in any conflict between the United States and China, and strategies to achieve “dominance in the space, cyber, electromagnetic, and possibly psychological domains.” The intent is to disrupt, paralyze, or destroy an opponent’s operational capabilities. This makes it likely that China has considered attacks on critical U.S. civilian infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most probable targets fall into three categories: The first would be electrical power facilities. The second would be the pipelines and railroads in the continental United States that connect to these locations. The third would be the logistics and communications networks, including those that support supply chains for manufacturing precision-guided munitions and military aircraft. Primary targets would include telecommunications systems in cities and regions where naval and air bases are located, such as California, Hawaii, and Washington State. All are logical targets for cyber disruption, and many are located on the United States’ Pacific Rim. Disruptions at such targets would provide near-term, tangible military advantage and would be conducted in parallel with Chinese cyber actions against military targets, such as information systems and advanced weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The broad calculus for China’s decisionmaking will likely involve weighing the relative military advantage gained from cyberattacks on critical infrastructure against the probability that such attacks would provoke a harsh U.S. response or expand the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s planning is likely bound by a desire to minimize the probability of a general war with the United States. Cyberattacks against targets in the continental United States and Hawaii could threaten to prolong any conflict and make it unmanageable. The question for China’s leaders is whether quick and precise strikes on civilian critical infrastructure with temporary effects justify this strategic risk. In preparing to defend against cyberattacks, however, the United States cannot assume that China will decide on a minimalist course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;likely-targets&quot;&gt;Likely Targets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All digital targets are vulnerable to some degree. Pipelines, for example, stretch for thousands of miles across several states and traverse sparsely populated areas. They are digitally controlled, with many possible points for both cyber and physical disruption. The ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline showed that short-term disruption can produce political benefits. Although the Biden administration (led by the Transportation Security Administration) is taking steps to reduce risks, there are many possible digital and physical targets along the length of a pipeline, and hardening them will take time. Electric grids have always been considered high-value targets and the potential vulnerabilities of electrical grids are well-known. There has been progress in reducing vulnerability in the years since the 2007 Aurora test showed how a cyberattack could cause physical damage to an electrical power generator, but electrical power generation and transmission remains perhaps the most valuable target for disruption by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China could also target the communications infrastructure for disruption. Ukraine’s telecommunications infrastructure was a key target for Russia. In a Taiwan scenario, this could include attacks on undersea fiber-optic cables and communications satellites. It could also include kinetic attacks on physical infrastructure. Like pipelines, undersea fiber-optic cables stretch thousands of miles. They are most vulnerable in relatively shallow waters. Something as simple as a fishing trawler hooking and breaking a cable is effective. It is also likely that China will attempt to disrupt, blind, or disable both military and commercial satellites for reconnaissance, navigation, and communications. China may not distinguish between military and commercial satellites, and commercial satellites play an essential role in U.S. military communications. Chinese officials have privately complained about Starlink. China has practiced jamming and spoofing satellite signals for navigation, and media reports and leaked U.S. documents state that China has developed cyber “weapons” for use against U.S. satellites. Using cyber methods against satellites is less intrusive and less escalatory than kinetic attacks (though these cannot be ruled out) but may also have a lower probability of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine war points to the vulnerabilities of the precision-guided munitions (PGM) supply chain and the importance of steady resupply. These are complex munitions, so delays in obtaining even a single part can slow or stop production. The experience of European allies in the 2012 air campaign against Libya, where they depleted their PGM stocks within a few days, is suggestive of the benefits of disrupting the PGM supply chain. The United States (and regional allies) can prepare for this by stockpiling PGMs, but Ukraine shows that consumption rates are higher than expected. A combined cyberattack could disrupt PGM production and resupply. However, it remains an open question as to whether disruption to PGM resupply would provide the near-term benefits most useful to China, since the damage could take weeks to appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks on other critical infrastructures are possible but offer less of a benefit to China. Disrupting financial networks may provide secondary benefits if credit cards won’t work and cash is unavailable. Disrupting municipal traffic control systems would provide temporary (and easily remedied) disturbances. Civil air traffic management systems are likely targets since civilian air freight will play a role in the resupply of high-value equipment (like PGMs), but the effects of a cyberattack on air traffic control could be quickly remedied, given U.S. experience in dealing with air traffic disruptions. Attacks on other infrastructures are unlikely to provide any military or strategic benefit. Water supply in key metropolitan areas may be one exception to this, since telecommunications and electricity depend on it. In all instances, deciding on targets, their location, and whether to strike them using cyberattacks will require a careful calculation of immediate military benefit weighed against the strategic risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;factors-affecting-chinese-decisions-to-use-cyberattacks&quot;&gt;Factors Affecting Chinese Decisions to Use Cyberattacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Ukraine, given U.S. military setbacks in the Middle East and Xi Jinping’s belief that the West was in irreversible decline, the Chinese government likely overestimated the level of action they could engage in without risk. The Western response to Ukraine, including sanctions against Russia and financial and military support for Ukraine, has led China to recalculate the costs of action against Taiwan, but domestic political pressures could still impel Xi to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is currently unlikely that China will use force to occupy Taiwan, if it does decide to do so, it would undoubtedly prefer a short, sharp conflict, sinking a few U.S. carriers while holding off any U.S. response until its forces occupied the country. The PLA has, after all, been practicing some kind of Taiwan invasion scenario for 70 years. Their calculations may be similar to those made by Axis forces before World War II: that a sharp, decisive blow against U.S. naval and air forces in the Pacific region at the onset of conflict would stop the United States from intervening and dissuade it from continuing the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factors that shape the calculations that apply to critical infrastructure are the comparative risks of striking civilian versus military targets, and the risk of striking targets in the continental United States. If China chose to attack civilian infrastructure in the continental United States, the most effective cyber actions against critical infrastructure would unavoidably affect several large U.S. cities, such as San Diego, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Honolulu. Collateral damage is inevitable if electrical power, telecommunications, and fuel pipelines are attacked. These are civilian infrastructures, but they are legitimate targets. The United States has attacked similar targets in the past, showing restraint when it believed it would quickly occupy opponent territory and need these infrastructures for itself. China does not face similar constraints, and the risk of civilian casualties from cyberattack in these cities is extremely low — the intended result is most likely the disruption of critical infrastructure, not physical damage or casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China may consider targeting Washington, D.C., in the hope that disruption to power and communications in the nation’s capital would slow any U.S. response; however, the degree of resilience found in national command systems and the risk of a fierce U.S. response to a cyberattack on the capital suggest that Chinese efforts at disruption in D.C. are unlikely. It is also likely that China would prefer to reserve cyber tools for intelligence gathering rather than disruption since it has had a long record of remarkable successes against the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese planners face the complications of having to consider attacks on U.S. military facilities located in allied territory, particularly Japan. If Japan has not entered the conflict, it would be in China’s interest not to attack targets in Okinawa or other areas. If Japan has entered the conflict, China will need to decide if it targets only U.S. military facilities in Japan, attacks Japanese critical infrastructure that supports these facilities, or disrupts some broader range of targets. Moving up this target ranking risks expanding and prolonging any conflict, so China may — if it is reasonable (though participants in a conflict tend to become less reasonable the longer it continues) — minimize cyber actions against Japan. The most likely outcome is that in the context of armed conflict, China will decide it has little to lose by launching cyberattacks against Japan’s military and critical energy and communications infrastructures and will seek to maximize disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One assumption behind this analysis is that economic warfare (e.g., striking targets in order to degrade the opponent economy and industrial capacity as opposed to striking targets that directly support military operations in order to disrupt them) is unlikely. Although some argue that China has engaged for decades in long-term, low-level economic warfare, this assertion is unsupported by any direct evidence and Chinese intentions are best described as espionage to build its economy and technological capabilities. In a short conflict, the military benefits of economic warfare would arrive too late to change the outcome and striking civilian manufacturing targets (such as factories) risks expanding the conflict. Although there could be benefits to disrupting production at oil refineries or semiconductor fabs, this benefit is smaller than in the past given the globally distributed nature of supply chains, which creates a fair degree of resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks are most effective when combined with other weapons, including conventional delivery systems, PGMs, unmanned aerial vehicles, and electronic warfare (EW). This combination can cripple command networks and advanced weapons systems and, if done at scale, may overwhelm defenders by exploiting a rapid pace and large scale of action. Against Taiwan, the United States should expect to see a combination of cyber and kinetic attacks. Coordinated kinetic and cyber action against targets in the United States are very unlikely (with the exception of Guam, which is within easy missile range of China). Kinetic actions against targets in the continental United States or Hawaii would create an unmanageable risk of escalation for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;influence-operations&quot;&gt;Influence Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption of critical infrastructure may not be the only target of Chinese cyber efforts. China could use its trove of personal information on millions of U.S. officials, civilians, and service members to send intimidating or confusing emails, text messages, and social media posts to them and their families (as the Russians have done in Ukraine). Officials in one Asian country have said that China used its access to telecommunications systems in that country to send politically oriented text messages to all mobile phone users in the country and something similar could be done to Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia attempted to blend cyberattack, EW, and psychological operations in its invasion of Ukraine. Russian EW systems (such as the Leer 3) were able to connect to Ukrainian mobile telephone networks, both to disrupt communications and to collect and send messages. These have had limited success in Ukraine given the political circumstances. The Chinese have not shown the skill of the Russians in influence operations, but the population of Taiwan will be a target for text, email, and video messages — perhaps generated by new artificial intelligence tools — intended to create confusion and emphasize the futility of resistance. The United States should also expect Chinese actors with a presence on U.S. social media platforms to plant disinformation aimed at U.S. media and audiences. China will also try to inject disinformation into global media about U.S. losses and (if there is opportunity) collateral damage to civilian targets from U.S. actions. Artificial intelligence provides a way not only to make more convincing digital falsehoods, but also to inject them at speed and at scale against the target population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A global audience, some of which is inherently hostile or predisposed to distrust the United States, is a better venue for China’s influence operations than the United States given the broad consensus among the American population and leaders on the need to compete with China and the intense reactions that attacks on U.S. territory have generated in the past. The United States cannot assume that Chinese aggression against Taiwan will be met with universal disapproval. Russian propaganda about Ukraine has been successful in Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America despite clear evidence of its aggression. China could similarly engage these audiences. A Chinese campaign could attempt to exploit pacifist sentiment in Asian countries like Japan, but if China is seen as the aggressor, it will likely not gain traction with regional audiences. This suggests that Chinese influence operations will be unsuccessful with U.S. and Northeast Asian audiences but more persuasive in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reconnaissance-is-a-warning-not-necessarily-a-prelude&quot;&gt;Reconnaissance Is a Warning, Not Necessarily a Prelude&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are likely targets and this analysis does not consider the effect of cyberattacks, which may be limited even if successful, particularly if ships, satellites, aircraft, and air defenses are well defended. However, given the complexity of digital networks and the unevenness of cybersecurity preparation in the United States, if China decides to attack critical infrastructure, some attacks would be likely to succeed. Efforts to create a “zero threat architecture” are misleading in the context of military action by state actors. There will always be some success for cyberattacks, so the goal should be not to prevent but to minimize these successes and to be resilient in the continued provision of digital services when defense inevitably has failed. A later white paper will discuss defending against cyber actions during armed conflict, but planning must consider how to continue necessary operations and services despite cyber disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conducting reconnaissance is not always a prelude to attack. Russia has conducted strategic reconnaissance against the United States for decades without acting on it. Reconnaissance is, however, an indication of both increased risk and opponent intentions that should guide U.S. preparations for defense. It should be assumed that some percentage of Chinese cyberattacks against U.S. targets would succeed, making the issue a matter of how to ensure resilience and recovery. Even if Chinese cyberattacks against U.S. critical infrastructure are unlikely, the United States needs to prepare for them, improve cyber defenses for the most probable targets, and test its capacity for response and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent article, Admiral James G Stavridis, the former NATO SACEUR, suggested that a NATO-led convoying system in the Black Sea could go some distance towards alleviating the costs of Russia’s de facto blockade of Ukraine following President Vladimir Putin’s withdrawal from the grain deal. While Stavridis makes a number of important points, a convoying system would be an impractical solution to the challenges posed by a blockade, one which would incur significant risks for uncertain gains. Instead, an approach to meeting the challenge of the blockade should be built on two pillars: circumvention in the short term, and a wider effort aimed at coercing Russia back into a settlement in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem-with-convoys&quot;&gt;The Problem with Convoys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several issues with using the Iran–Iraq Tanker War of the 1980s as an analogy for a potential full-scale convoying operation in the Black Sea. The first issue is that to a far greater extent than the Tanker War, the outcome of a contest to move grain through Ukrainian ports will be determined by the attitudes of insurers. US convoying operations during the Tanker War mitigated but did not eliminate the high war risk premiums demanded by insurers, not least because they were restricted to reflagged Kuwaiti vessels. The reason that neither Iraq nor Iran was able to seriously impact the other’s oil exports and the global economy was that the profit margins involved in moving oil justified the transit even in the face of higher insurance rates – something that is not as true for grain. Moreover, Iraq was able to circumvent the Iranian blockade using overland pipelines to Turkey and Yanbu in Saudi Arabia. While convoying was a useful means of both defending the principle of freedom of navigation and forestalling the Soviet Union’s efforts to increase its influence in Kuwait, its economic impact was marginal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the major challenge facing Ukraine is that insurers’ risk perceptions will likely drive a spike in war risk premiums, which could make movement in the Black Sea effectively unprofitable, or even lead to coverage being withdrawn. While convoys could resolve this underlying challenge by reassuring shipowners, they could also have the opposite effect. The sight of NATO and Russian assets operating cheek by jowl could just as easily increase perceptions of war risk. Russia could exacerbate this risk through acts of brinkmanship such as risky aerial manoeuvres, much as it has done recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second major issue with convoys is that the Russian threat to shipping in the northern Black Sea is in certain ways dissimilar to the Iranian one. Iran sought to interdict or attack vessels at sea using the assets of its navy and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), making the presence of nearby friendly combatant vessels a useful deterrent. Russia’s fleet has largely avoided the northern Black Sea since the Moskva incident. The risk posed by Ukrainian coastal defence cruise missiles such as the Harpoon and Neptune has largely eliminated the surface vessels of the Black Sea Fleet as a presence in the northern Black Sea. The primary tools of blockade for Russia are naval mines – which it can seed using a range of capabilities including its Kilo-class submarines – and missile strikes on storage sites on the ground. Convoys can usefully deter things such as the interdiction and boarding of vessels, but are of less value in the face of a mine threat. Indeed, in instances such as the Bridgeton incident during the Tanker War, US assets had to form up in columns behind a double-hulled tanker as a defence against mines. The mine challenge could be a basis for deploying mine countermeasures (MCM) vessels – something discussed in the original article – but as will be articulated more fully later, this is a separate consideration from convoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third consideration, acknowledged by figures such as Stavridis, is the degree to which the Montreux Convention constrains policy options. Considering that the aggregate tonnage of all non-Black Sea navies at any given time cannot exceed 45,000 tonnes (around the weight of five Ticonderoga-class cruisers) and that vessels must rotate out of the region after 21 days, the ability of non-Black Sea countries to maintain credible forces in the region will be circumscribed irrespective of whether they are willing to commit more vessels. Of course, a Turkish decision either to void certain restrictions or to participate in a convoy system itself could change this dynamic, but this remains unlikely. A convoy system could only work in practice if it was led by those members of NATO that are also Black Sea states, with a somewhat token presence provided by Allies from beyond the region. This implies that smaller members of the Alliance would bear the lion’s share of the cost and risk – something they are unlikely to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a real risk of escalation, as acknowledged. While Russia is unlikely to directly attack a NATO member, there are a number of avenues to inadvertent escalation. For example, if a NATO vessel struck a mine like the USS Samuel B Roberts did during the Tanker War, the Alliance would be faced with an unpalatable choice between escalating or choosing not to attribute the damage (and thus perhaps incentivising intentional efforts to clandestinely attack its vessels). A weaker opponent may act in risk-acceptant ways that draw it into clashes with a stronger rival – as Iran’s IRGC did with the US Navy on several occasions. Brinkmanship by both sides can create room for misunderstandings, as was nearly the case during the Cold War when a Soviet Tu-16 buzzing a US carrier pitched into the sea in an incident which could have been misinterpreted as a shootdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-short-term-approach-circumvention-and-limited-support-to-shipping&quot;&gt;A Short-Term Approach: Circumvention and Limited Support to Shipping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are short-term solutions that adopt elements of the proposals put forward by proponents of a more forward-leaning NATO role, but which do not require the Ukrainians and their partners to run the risks of a full-scale convoying operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foremost among these is circumventing the blockade. Both overland routes and riverine transit via the Danube offer alternatives to the Black Sea. In the past year, Ukraine’s riverine ports such as Izmail have seen a substantial increase in the volume of shipping that they have handled. While not sufficient to completely offset the impact of a blockade, this could substantially mitigate the challenge. Unsurprisingly, these ports have come under sustained air attack by Russia. The challenge of air defence, while complex and resource-intensive, can be resolved by the provision of additional platforms to Ukraine. A more ambitious course could see Ukraine’s partners defend these areas from cruise missiles directly. Given their proximity to the borders of a NATO state, a defensive counter-air mission over these riverine ports need not be framed as an entry into the conflict, but rather as a means of mitigating risk. The fact that such a mission would involve intercepts of missiles and not manned aircraft limits the risk of escalation. To be sure, any such decision would need to be taken alongside efforts to define the geographical limits of NATO support to avoid mission creep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second palliative would be subsidising overland transport. Thus far, the costs of overland transport and the reluctance of European states such as Poland to expose their own farmers to competition from Ukrainian produce – which is more price-competitive in nearby countries than it is after a long and costly transit – have meant that the EU’s grain corridors have had limited utility for Ukraine. Subsidising the transit of Ukrainian goods to ensure that they do not stay in EU countries could be a ready fix to this conundrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ultimately, the only long-term guarantee of freedom of navigation in the Black Sea is a settlement with Russia; anything short of this will not solve the problem of war risk premiums&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a basis for a more limited approach to directly challenging the blockade. Clearing mines through channels in the western Black Sea could allow some vessels to depart from Odessa, especially if the effort was combined with a bolstering of Ukraine’s ground-based air defences. There is an obvious utility to vessels such as MCM ships, but the value of a wider convoying effort is less clear. Because of the Black Sea Fleet’s restricted freedom of action in the face of the Ukrainian coastal defence cruise missile threat, the risk to vessels at sea will come primarily from mines, and they are likely to be most at risk when they are stationary targets in port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, MCM vessels operating on their own would be vulnerable to Russian attack (though Russia’s difficulty in sinking the Ukrainian tank landing ship Yuri Olefirenko at sea demonstrates real challenges with dynamic targeting). It should be noted, however, that even a convoy in the Black Sea would theoretically be at risk of being sunk if Russia wished to invest the resources into doing so. The deterrent to this would be the wider implications of a direct attack on a Western vessel, not the vessel’s own defences. While it might be regarded as counterintuitive to deploy vessels in such a manner, it is worth noting that this is precisely what Western European deployments such as the Armilla patrol did during the Tanker War by utilising naval vessels that were unarmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given their limited tonnage and lack of offensive armaments, MCM could be rotated into the region in larger numbers and with less escalatory risk. The task of navies, then, would be to brief insurers on the fact that the absence of convoys does not mean that channels are unsafe, given the low likelihood of direct Russian interdiction by surface platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to air defences, NATO members such as Greece and Bulgaria which currently operate S-300 batteries could be encouraged to play a role here. Similarly, the US Army’s Iron Dome batteries, which may have some utility against threats such as UAVs, could be donated if – as argued by some – they are deemed unfit for the environments in which the US expects its ground forces to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with this, a multilateral effort to provide state-backed insurance could be utilised to further mitigate the financial risk undertaken by vessels’ owners. This is something Iran did to good effect during the Tanker War when it underwrote 15% of the cost of insurance. This contributed to Iran’s oil exports rebounding to pre-war levels by the late 1980s, despite the Iraqi air threat to terminals like Kharg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each approach is likely to be extremely expensive and involve diplomatic and financial costs. Countries are loathe to part with capabilities such as air defences, and subsidising transport is likely to be exceedingly expensive. However, the ability of a new Iranian regime to achieve the latter goal in the 1980s demonstrates that it is not impossible, while the former is less diplomatically challenging than organising a multilateral convoying effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-long-term-coercing-russia-into-a-settlement&quot;&gt;The Long Term: Coercing Russia into a Settlement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the palliatives described above can only work in the short term, however, given the costs involved. Ultimately, the only long-term guarantee of freedom of navigation in the Black Sea is a settlement with Russia; anything short of this will not solve the problem of war risk premiums. The question for Ukraine and its backers, then, is how Russia can be coerced into entering a settlement and respecting it. The importance of the ability to counter an opponent’s blockade with one’s own punitive measures, thus denying them the perception that time is on their side if they only wait, is an enduring lesson of naval combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if Ukraine’s ongoing offensive proves immensely successful, Crimea might cease to be a springboard for Russian coercion, and the country’s Azov ports might open. That said, it is worth planning for a more conservative outcome in which both sides remain deadlocked and Russia seeks to grind Ukraine down through a long-term campaign against the country’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Ukraine’s ability to compel Russia to re-enter some form of agreement on shipping (even if hostilities continue) will be predicated on its capacity to counter-escalate. There are several avenues by which this might be done. Firstly, Ukrainian forces can contest Russia’s own commercial vessels’ freedom of navigation at or near ports. The uncrewed assets used near Sevastopol could serve as a useful tool to harass shipping, and though Russia would likely deploy countermeasures, this could still drive up insurance rates. Presumably such vessels could also be used as minelayers – though their carrying capacity might be somewhat limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the immediate term, it will likely prove more viable to mitigate the effects of the blockade by circumventing it&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, a more concerted effort could be made to identify and interdict the grey shipping upon which Russia’s own economy depends. Though it is politically and legally challenging to seize vessels on the high seas, states with territorial waters that straddle transit chokepoints can deny these vessels access if they are not suitably insured against environmental risks. NATO countries that currently straddle such chokepoints include the UK and France (in the case of the English Channel and Gibraltar) and Turkey (at the Bosporus). Of course, it is unlikely that a unanimous approach to interdicting such vessels will be achieved, but heightened pressure in this area could still increase the costs for Moscow and contribute to enabling subsequent negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most crucially, however, Ukraine must be able to limit the Black Sea Fleet’s ability to operate out of Sevastopol. The threat of Ukraine accomplishing this could be sufficient to compel Russia to re-enter a settlement. We might consider, for example, how the Houthi movement’s ability to impose costs on its opponents and effectively shut down key ports and cities such as Marib with ballistic missiles played an important role in driving the anti-Houthi coalition towards a settlement in Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming the current lines stay broadly stable, the Ukrainians would need either cruise or ballistic missiles with a range of over 300 km to achieve this. While it is presently unlikely that the US-made ATACMS will be provided to Ukraine, other options exist. For example, a concerted effort could be made to expand production lines for Storm Shadow – a weapon already in Ukraine, but one that the country must use sparingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative would be to use the soil of friendly states to commence the production of indigenous designs such as the Grom-2 ballistic missile in sanctuaries safe from destruction by Russian airpower. More immediate means of contesting Russian commercial ports could include low-cost UAVs, which appear to have been used in Russia itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another capability which could conceivably abet a counter-blockade but which would presently be difficult to manufacture in Ukraine is submersibles capable of carrying torpedoes – something currently being prototyped by, among others, a UAE-based Ukrainian firm. Production lines for such capabilities could be set up on the territory of NATO members which currently sit within the Black Sea, enabling their transfer without the need to violate article 19 of Montreux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are legitimate concerns regarding the escalatory risks involved in giving Ukraine the capacity to act against Russian interests at reach. That being said, generating the capacity to – for example – manufacture missiles for Ukraine will be time-consuming, and could thus give both parties the diplomatic space to re-enter a settlement. Even a latent threat to reinforce Ukraine’s offensive capacity could be useful, irrespective of whether it is acted upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there are no ideal solutions to the challenge posed by Russia’s blockade. Though appealing, the obvious immediate palliative of a convoy system is likely to be unworkable in practice. Though many issues impede such a solution, as discussed, its primary flaw is the fact that it does not obviate the most significant challenge facing Ukrainian exports – the fact that high war risk premiums will likely remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the immediate term, it will likely prove more viable to mitigate the effects of the blockade by circumventing it. Though costly, circumvention via routes such as the Danube offers the most immediately viable method of limiting – if not quite eliminating – the impact of the blockade. Alongside this, allied navies can make genuine immediate contributions in areas such as mine countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium to long term, the most viable route to a resumption of Black Sea shipping from Ukrainian ports is a campaign to progressively increase the pressure on Russia’s own maritime posture in the region, as well as to impose costs in other areas, with a view to eventually reaching a durable settlement which at a minimum separates the issue of freedom of navigation from the wider conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9PSRQLV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（10日）踏入審訊第103天。鄒家成繼續作供，表示受邀出席抗爭派記者會，理解「冇一個確切嘅人去組織」，而會上除讀出的立場聲明外並無共同發言。就岑敖暉會上指若「暴政當道、魔警橫行」，相信不論內容也會否決預算案，鄒認為岑並非主張無差別否決，因岑曾向他提過「唔通政府掟幾千萬查警暴我都投反對票？」，鄒亦認為只要政府於預算案有回應五大訴求已足夠。法官陳慶偉指，但「五大訴求」口號是「缺一不可」而非「一個即可」，鄒回應「五大訴求，缺一不可」的精神不是要求「一步登天」，而是即使政府回應一個或兩個訴求後，仍鍥而不捨繼續爭取。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒今完成主問，續接受控方盤問，表示雖認為35+不可能，但無於初選論壇表明，是因論壇始終由一班「相信35+有可能」的人舉辦，故想「禮貌少少」，「費事搞禍人哋個場」。而就《國安法》後帖文稱「有啲嘢我唔可以繼續講」、但相信過去理念已表達清楚，鄒同意當時仍擁抱過去表達過的理念，無論《國安法》有否落實，其理念也一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱受邀出席抗爭派記者會標準為非傳統泛民初選勝出者&quot;&gt;鄒稱受邀出席抗爭派記者會、標準為非傳統泛民初選勝出者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成第5日作供，辯方就2020年7月15日抗爭派記者會發問。鄒同意，本土抗爭派於初選有很好的成績，召開記招是為了多謝選民，並向泛民主派「伸出橄欖枝」。法官陳仲衡問記招由誰發起，鄒認為「冇一個確切嘅人去組織」，而他是前一日受邀出席，印象中是張崑陽、岑敖暉、黃之鋒其中一個，「但我真係唔肯定係邊個。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指邀請他的人有提及出席人士的標準，他理解是「非傳統泛民嘅初選勝出者」，而該人無特別講為何想開記招，鄒亦覺得，選舉完結後開記招向民眾宣布一些訊息「係好正常嘅事」。法官陳慶偉提及陳志全無被邀請（陳早前稱獲朱凱廸邀請但拒絕），因他不是傳統泛民，鄒指他不知道陳有否被邀請，但「我自己唔會將佢咁樣分類」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱除抗爭派聲明外無共同發言會上發言僅代表發言者自己&quot;&gt;鄒稱除抗爭派聲明外無共同發言、會上發言僅代表發言者自己&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，於同月14日約好時間、地點，並於翌日早上約10時到達記招場地學聯會址，指有關記招事宜「全部都係嗰日朝早先至一齊傾」，他們首先討論當日發布、後於會上讀出的「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」。陳仲衡問誰帶領討論？鄒說「其實冇㗎，大家有意見就講出嚟」，而他們當時使用「Google Doc」，「有幾個人一齊打（字）緊」，認為每個出席者均看過該篇聲明，「大家都同意咗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師陳世傑問，那除了該聲明，記者會上還有否任何共同發言（joint announcement or statement）？鄒指「除咗呢個聲明冇喇」。鄒並指，記招前有討論如何處理記者提問，「除咗指名道姓之外，其他問題呢就大家想答就自己答⋯⋯如果自己想補充，就自己攞支咪去講。」陳世傑問，會上回應是代表在場所有人抑或發言者自己？鄒說：「佢自己。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒同意王百羽梁晃維就否決財案及攬炒議會等發言&quot;&gt;鄒同意王百羽、梁晃維就否決財案及攬炒議會等發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續就其他人發言回應，法官陳仲衡問到王百羽提及：「我哋嗰個最大公因數就一定係講緊堅決反對財政預算案，如果五大訴求無落實嘅話，依個係我哋共同嘅諗法」，是代表所有人發言？鄒說：「其他人我唔知，我自己個立場一直都係話，如果財政預算案我見唔到關於五大訴求嘅內容，我個人都係會投反對票」，指他同意王的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3A1obQr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於梁晃維強調一旦進入立法會，「無論我哋係對政府嘅提案定係財政預算案去投下反對票，呢一個都係我哋作為代議士嘅一個合法權利…我哋亦都繼續提倡議會攬炒嘅路線，係逼使政府係向人民低頭」，鄒表示「我同意呀」，其後在盤問下稱與梁從無就「攬炒」有任何討論，故不完全知道梁當時意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒不同意岑敖暉主張無差別否決指岑曾反問唔通政府掟幾千萬查警暴也反對&quot;&gt;鄒不同意岑敖暉主張無差別否決、指岑曾反問「唔通政府掟幾千萬查警暴」也反對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而被問會否否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求，岑敖暉回答如能進入議會，「我哋係會好堅定行使基本法賦予畀代議士嘅權力，所以答案係：是嘅。」鄒指不同意岑這句話，認為他「答得唔係好清楚」，不過指岑其後被追問「即係無論嗰個財政預算案嘅內容係咩嘢都會否決？」時，有提到「唔係㗎」，並重新再答：「如果香港係已經落實咗五大訴求，如果係有真普選嘅話，我相信我哋係會有磋商嘅空間；但係如果仍然今日係暴政當道、魔警橫行嘅話，我相信我哋係無論咩嘢內容都係會否決呢一個財政預算案嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JQsSrgy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 岑敖暉（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒表示，認為岑不是談及「無差別」否決財案，而他同意岑此說法。惟陳慶偉指岑雖無用「無差別」一詞，但提及「無論咩嘢內容都係會否決」，實際上傳達了該訊息。鄒不同意，認為岑當時提到「暴政當道、魔警橫行」是指政府不回應五大訴求的表現，如政府有回應五大訴求，這些情況應不會出現，而如果繼續出現，則代表政府無回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指認為政府有回應五大訴求已足夠非一定全落實才不反對&quot;&gt;鄒指認為政府有回應五大訴求已足夠、非一定全落實才不反對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問，岑敖暉是指否決預算案的決定性因素（determining factor），是五大訴求有否「落實」？鄒同意，但補充就他而言「我覺得係『回應』已經夠」，「唔一定要五個（訴求）齊晒之後先⋯⋯」李運騰打斷，質疑岑要求五大訴求「落實」、但鄒只是要求「回應」，二人立場是否不同？鄒指「可能因為我識佢」，故認為岑用「落實」一字「唔係話一定要晒五大訴求先會再同政府傾」，並在李追問下稱不同意岑說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰笑指，鄒早前稱同意，現在又說不同意。鄒重申，理解岑敖暉該句表達如政府無回應五大訴求，即「暴政當道、魔警橫行」繼續持續的情況下，「budget 入面都唔會見到關於五大訴求嘅內容，咁就投反對票喇」。而他記招前無與岑就預算案有任何討論，但記招後岑曾向他提及：「唔通政府掟幾千萬查警暴我都投反對票？」，令他知道岑並非主張無差別否決財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱五大訴求非一步登天為鍥而不捨繼續爭取精神&quot;&gt;鄒稱五大訴求非一步登天、為鍥而不捨繼續爭取精神&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉即指，「五大訴求」的口號並非只有「五大訴求」，是「五大訴求，缺一不可」，而非「五大訴求，一個即可（only one met）」。鄒回應：「我覺得『五大訴求，缺一不可』背後嘅精神，並唔係要求一步登天，而係一個即使政府回應咗一個或者兩個（訴求）之後，一種鍥而不捨繼續爭取嘅精神。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，最後政府永遠也不能滿足他們的要求（appetite），指「你看，政府已經落實了其中一個訴求，即撤回《逃犯條例》」，鄒說「同意做咗」，陳說而撤回修例後又發生了這一連串事件。不過陳指理解鄒的回應，相信岑敖暉當時不是指落實所有訴求，而是如政府將回應部分訴求、部分訴求有機會落實，就不會否決，鄒同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱極權是不受制約有權勢者欺壓無權勢者-官打斷稱毋須深究&quot;&gt;鄒稱極權是不受制約有權勢者欺壓無權勢者 官打斷稱毋須深究&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於岑敖暉其後再提到立法會議員「絕對有權利喺每一個法案、每一個議案、每一個撥款都係投否決，呢一個係喺《基本法》賦予立法會議員非常之清晰嘅權利」，鄒表示同意，並理解岑只是強調「立法會議員係可以投反對票」、是《基本法》賦予立法會議員的權利，「佢並沒有話佢將來要每一樣嘢都投反對票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦問及鄒家成會上提到「我哋係時候要向世界，向香港人展示，我哋同呢個極權搏鬥嘅決心」，「極權」的意思。鄒指「我覺得極權係一個狀態嚟嘅，一種不受制約嘅有權勢者欺壓無權勢者嘅狀態，形成呢個狀態有兩個條件⋯⋯」，不過陳慶偉打斷說對政治看法無興趣。陳世傑追問「極權」與香港有何關係，惟陳慶偉再打斷說不認為需深究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒同意若預算案無反映五大訴求開支-會向政府提問談判&quot;&gt;鄒同意若預算案無反映五大訴求開支 會向政府提問談判&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成其後接受代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文盤問，同意2020年時已知道，議員可向各部門就預算案開支提問，而他曾提及以五大訴求為「唯一優先標準」審視財案，是將五大訴求與預算案連繫，並同意至少就成立獨立調查委員會、及重啟政改達至雙普選兩個訴求，均「需要用錢」，他打算當選後於討論預算案時就此發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉庭上早前提及「鉛水事件」獨立調查委員會，指無出現在預算案。沈士文續展示2016至17年度立法會財委會時任議員單仲偕就預算案的查詢，以及行政署長的回覆。主控萬德豪質疑，鄒當時並不在立法會會議，為何要就文件發問，沈士文指想問鄒當時是否打算入議會後利用此機制問這類問題。陳慶偉指太空泛，並認為毋須深入這些細節，指他提到鉛水事件獨立調查委員會，只因該調查突然出現，而他意思是如果調查委員會突然出現，預算案不會為該項目有所準備，但明白如預算案有項目是查警暴，鄒家成當然會表示小心審視預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文回應，展示該文件是指出鉛水事件獨立調查委員會的開支，於翌年預算案反映，陳慶偉指那與現時要裁決的議題無關，指鄒已表明會審視財案有否五大訴求的內容。鄒續同意，2020年時政府無回應成立獨立調查委員會等訴求，而他一旦當選，會優先向政府施壓要求成立調查委員會和落實雙普選，如政府回應會預期在2021年預算案反映，如看不到相關開支便會向政府提問，「到底對於呢兩個訴求，佢哋會點樣處理」，亦可謂在財委會與政府的「談判」階段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指不認識柯耀林不知李永成是沙田區政成員&quot;&gt;鄒指不認識柯耀林、不知李永成是沙田區政成員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表區政聯盟前召集人柯耀林的大律師唐樂山其後盤問，鄒同意，首次新東會議上人們「出出入入」，他不認識柯耀林，不知道他有否出席會議。而鄒第二次會議有與兩名民主黨代表就「會運用」否決權字眼爭論，辯方問鄒是否認得李永成是其中一個反對其動議的人？鄒指「如果坐喺我對面嗰個人係李永成，咁佢係有反對嘅」，又指「其中一個（反對）一定係林卓廷嘅代表」，但不知另一人身分。鄒又指，不知道李永成自2018年已不再屬民主黨，亦不知他是「區政聯盟」下「沙田區政」的成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒同意國安法後仍擁抱過去理念&quot;&gt;鄒同意《國安法》後仍擁抱過去理念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成其後接受主控萬德豪盤問，就鄒家成7月5日帖文〈對不起，我回來了〉，提及「国安法過咗，或者有啲嘢我唔可以繼續講，以前準備嘅好多文宣、易拉架都已經用唔著，但相信我嘅理念喺過去已經表達得清清楚楚，亦都希望各位香港人會理解」，萬德豪指鄒沒有表明放棄過去理念，鄒說：「的確冇呢個意思。」萬問，因此當時鄒仍擁抱過去表達過的理念？鄒答「係」。萬指而不論《國安法》有否落實，鄒的理念也一樣？鄒再答「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方追問有否提過dq-官指替補機制一直是協調會議題肯定有提&quot;&gt;控方追問有否提過DQ 官指替補機制一直是協調會議題肯定有提&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成又同意，於參選宣言提到「我唔奢望喺殖民者嘅制度下可以議會過半奪取政治權力」，是表達35+不可能，因政府會以DQ阻民主派取35+，又指就個人會否被DQ，「我唔會評估為低（風險）嘅」。鄒續指，無在協調會議向人表示他會被DQ、也不記得有無人這樣提及，而他認為DQ議題貫徹整個初選，「一定有」參選人提過，但講不到是在何時何地由誰提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪欲追問，陳慶偉打斷指看不到為何要就此盤問，指替補機制一直是協調會議的議題，因此肯定有提到DQ，並着控方直接問問題。萬追問，有參選人提及會有DQ風險？惟陳慶偉打斷指「當然，不然呢？」。萬遂問，而沒有人說過他一定會被DQ？鄒答：「黃之鋒一定有講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2rnCED4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱無在論壇直接提35不可能因費事搞禍人哋個場&quot;&gt;鄒稱無在論壇直接提35+不可能因費事「搞禍」人哋個場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒遂同意，於初選論壇提過35+的可能性「非常之低」，但「的確冇用呢個『不可能』嘅字眼」。萬質疑若鄒一直認為35+不可能，為何不直接在論壇說出，鄒說「因為我諗住有禮貌少少，即係個論壇始終都係由一班相信35+有可能嘅人搞嘅，費事去人個場，好似搞禍人哋個場咁，所以就講非常之低」，並指「如果睇返成個初選論壇嘅 transcript，應該唔會覺得我覺得35+有可能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱與團隊較專注香港民族論述無看過戴耀廷文章&quot;&gt;鄒稱與團隊較專注「香港民族」論述、無看過戴耀廷文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於有否看過戴耀廷文章，鄒盤問下指當時較少留意時事，因準備選舉時與團隊較專注「香港民族」的論述、花較多時間製作單張。而他知道戴是知名政治人物，但案發時不知道他在《蘋果日報》和Facebook專頁撰文，沒有「like」戴Facebook，亦從沒讀過戴3至4月發表的文章，沒聽過戴談及有關「攬炒」的意思。控方追問沒有人告訴鄒？鄒說「真係冇」，指與團隊成員「傾香港民族比較多」，他與協調會議參與者亦「冇乜交流」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成早前承認與張可森和梁晃維發起「墨落無悔」聲明，今指4月時知道二人有興趣參與立法會選舉，遂「friend 搭 friend 咁樣見吓面、傾吓偈」，但初時無特別留意他們有否參加協調會議、無就此討論，只是「傾吓閒偈」，但在討論「墨落」的「嗰一刻」，「我肯定佢哋有出席過協調會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mmqthIs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒否認戴耀廷首次會議介紹攬炒文章提運用否決權&quot;&gt;鄒否認戴耀廷首次會議介紹攬炒文章、提運用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新東協調會議情況，萬德豪引述趙家賢證供，問首次會議是否有一名本土抗爭派向戴耀廷表示，曾讀過他在《蘋果日報》的文章並支持其主張。鄒指首先他不認同當時已有「本土抗爭派」的概念，其次他無留意當時有與會者提及戴耀廷的文章。惟萬續追問該人發言取態、戴之後是否再介紹「攬炒」文章，鄒重申無聽到亦無印象有介紹，戴亦無提及會運用基本法權力否決預算案、以此作為籌碼與中共談判，亦無印象戴提及當選後任期或只有7個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱一直理解否決veto為投反對票vote-against&quot;&gt;鄒稱一直理解「否決（veto）」為「投反對票（vote against）」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就鄒稱於第二次會議動議「會運用」否決權，萬指鄒在協調會和在「墨落無悔」都用了「否決（veto）」，鄒同意中文是用「否決」。萬指，但「否決」只能在立會過半後達到？鄒說「否決呢個中文字對我嚟講，一直都係 vote against（投反對票）呢個意思，唔係得我一個咁諗嘅，前立法會議員都一直係咁樣形容」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬遂問，鄒曾否告訴公眾，「否決」不是指取得過半後否決議案？惟法官陳仲衡打斷，指如鄒家成一直認為兩字意思一樣，如何向公眾解釋，萬終指留待陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒重申預算案無回應五大訴求會反對墨落已向選民交代對財案立場&quot;&gt;鄒重申預算案無回應五大訴求會反對、「墨落」已向選民交代對財案立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就抗爭派記者會岑敖暉的發言，法官陳慶偉問及若今天仍「暴政當道、魔警橫行」，鄒家成會否不論內容仍否決預算案。鄒指最重要的核心是政府有否在預算案回應人民訴求，「如果有，我相信都唔會暴政當道、魔警橫行」。陳慶偉指那不是其問題，並重複問題，鄒指「咁要首先處理咩係暴政，咩係魔警」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指其問題非常直接，認為鄒不想答他問題，鄒說「唔係」。陳問那是否要就他問的每隻字下定義？鄒說「如果有疑問我會照問」。陳說所以鄒不明白他的問題，鄒說「問多一次，唔好意思」，陳指他已問了兩次，鄒續說「答案係不會」。陳說因此鄒完全明白他的問題，鄒稱「我想嘗試吓進一步……」，但遭法官陳仲衡打斷，再問如到了辯論預算案時，政府和警察仍與舉行抗爭派記者會時的一樣，鄒會否否決，鄒重申：「審視完財政預算案之後，如果入面都係冇同五大訴求相關嘅內容，我都係會投反對票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬其後問，鄒有否告訴選民他不同意岑敖暉的說話，鄒說沒有，並指「『墨落無悔』已經係其中一個地方話畀選民知道，我會點樣處理財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後就6月17日鄒家成與張可森和梁晃維受訪片段發問，並指片中顯示訪問問題，但無寫在謄本，望即場播片截圖。法官陳慶偉後下令休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成稱倡「香港民族」並非港獨 指一國兩制下港人理應享自主權&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FUwsVuj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）踏入審訊第102天。鄒家成繼續作供，就初選論壇提到「對抗中華民族嘅入侵」，鄒指民族是建基於文化、價值等形成的共同體，「中華民族」與「香港民族」有別，是合理化損害港人利益和干預港人自主權的宣傳工具，他宣揚「香港民族主義」旨在高舉族群利益。法官質疑鄒稱無推動港獨，但又提自主是有矛盾，鄒不同意，指港人在《中英聯合聲明》下除國防、外交，理應享有一系列自主權，惟在無落實雙普選下，一國兩制無真正落實過。鄒早前稱「香港民族」與港獨不同，法官李運騰今指鄒是否實際上推動港獨或屬爭議點之一，法官陳慶偉亦指明白兩者分別，但不代表不會考慮，鄒為了建立香港民族理念是意圖顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另就論壇提到議員應入議會「打交」，鄒指意指「自衛」，從無想過開會期間「主動冚佢（建制派）一巴」，「呢個太痴線喇」；至於用任何手段癱瘓每個會議，他只是望盡力阻止「惡法」通過，承認「誇張咗」。鄒又同意帖文故意以簡體字陳述「国安法」是表達反對，但無想過違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱國安法後調整選舉文宣-刪香港民族殖民字眼&quot;&gt;鄒稱《國安法》後調整選舉文宣 刪「香港民族」、「殖民」字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成今第4日作供，鄒昨提及《國安法》頒布後曾考慮退出初選，但哽咽稱：「我發覺我根本就做唔出退選嘅決定，我覺得我無法離群眾而去。」鄒今甫開庭向代表大律師陳世傑表示：「唔好意思陳大狀，我琴日表現有啲失禮」，陳笑着叫他向法庭道歉，法官陳仲衡笑說記不起鄒有什麼失禮，陳慶偉亦笑說要喚醒記憶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續引鄒2020年7月5日發布的帖文〈對不起，我回來了〉，提及「如果我繼續原本嗰套主張，唔單止我，我嘅團隊成員，幫手派 leaflet 嘅義工，同埋幫我貼海報嘅黃店都一定會出事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指當時擔憂過往發表的言論會否有機會違反《國安法》，亦憂如果繼續參選，「被捕嘅未必只係我自己，而係我嘅團隊成員、我嘅義工等等，都可能受到牽連」，故當時除了調整選舉文宣、嘗試避免違反《國安法》，亦安排團隊成員聯絡義工表示：「如果你感到恐懼嘅話你就退出，我哋唔會介意嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱過去宣揚過係一個事實-但在肅殺環境下港人會知道為何調整&quot;&gt;鄒稱「過去宣揚過係一個事實」 但在肅殺環境下港人會知道為何調整&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，鄒提到「如果我繼續原本嗰套主張」，是提出假設、抑或實際放棄某些主張？鄒指是後者，並重申如他繼續派原有文宣「全部都有機會被捕」。李追問那除了口號，實質內容（substance）有否改變？鄒指有，指整套選舉文宣口號有更改，所有旗幟、易拉架、傳單亦全部重新印過，主要減少用一些對體制批評較尖銳的字眼，亦無再談及「香港民族」或「殖民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續指，但帖文最後提及「但相信我嘅理念喺過去已經表達得清清楚楚，亦都希望各位香港人會理解」，指鄒不是說會改變政綱，而是過去已表達清楚。鄒同意，表示「即係過咗去嘅嘢我都捉唔返㗎啦，過去宣揚過係一個事實，我改咗啲文宣係一個事實」，而「喺一個咁肅殺嘅環境底下，其實香港人會知道點解參選人會做呢啲調整」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱帖文故意用簡體字国安法-指表達反對但冇諗過違反國安法&quot;&gt;鄒稱帖文故意用簡體字「国安法」 指表達反對「但冇諗過違反《國安法》」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，理解鄒指推動「香港民族」不代表推動「香港獨立」，若這一直是其理念，為何帖文不解釋清楚他不是推動香港獨立。鄒解釋，因認為「香港民族主義」會被理解為分裂國家或港獨言論是來自部分人的「誤解」，而他於選舉如此提出主要是想「高舉族群利益」；而他與團隊當時思考繼續參選的意義，「我哋覺得係堅持埋最後呢十日左右嘅選舉嘅日子已經足夠喇，所以喺啲政治理念上面我哋唔想再解釋太多、講太多。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，留意到帖文全部用繁體字，只有在提及「国安法」時才用簡體字，問是否故意（deliberate），鄒答「係」，解釋因《國安法》經「附件三」立法，並非經立法會立法。惟李運騰質疑《基本法》也沒有經立法會立法，鄒停頓了一下續回應：「我唔鍾意用返繁體字去講《國安法》」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒在法官陳仲衡追問下，同意提及「国安法」可理解為抗議的標誌（sign），並指「我的確反對《國安法》」，當時其中一個繼續參選的意義亦是「表達一種反對《國安法》嘅聲音，但冇諗過違反《國安法》」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱中華民族是合理化損害港人利益宣傳工具香港民族與中華民族不同&quot;&gt;鄒稱「中華民族」是合理化損害港人利益宣傳工具、香港民族與中華民族不同&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就6月28日的新東初選論壇發問，就鄒提及「我諗我今次參選嘅目的非常之旗幟鮮明，我就係要宣揚香港民族主義，因為要建立一個民族出嚟，我哋先能夠對抗到中華民族嘅入侵」，陳仲衡問「中華民族嘅入侵」是否指中國共產黨，鄒否認，指「中華民族對我嚟講，係一個用嚟合理化損害港人利益、干預港人自主權嘅宣傳工具」，又指「我認為喺殖民統治之下，背後操控嘅人，正正就係擁抱中華民族思想嘅人，而呢種殖民嘅統治方式係會弱化一個民族嘅根基，所以我就喺選舉入面宣揚香港民族嘅理念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指他概念上有困難，問鄒是否認為「香港民族」作為一個族群（ethnic group），與「中華民族」是不同，鄒說：「我認為係嘅，因為一個民族係建基於語言、文化、價值、歷史、命運而形成嘅共同體，香港人喺歷史上面對於價值嘅追求……」，惟陳慶偉打斷，指不認為需要深究（“I don’t think we have to go into all these.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱港人理應享自主權-除非落實雙普選-否則一國兩制無真正落實&quot;&gt;鄒稱港人理應享自主權 除非落實雙普選 否則一國兩制無真正落實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，鄒一方面說並非推動港獨，但一方面又提到「自主權」，是否有矛盾（inconsistency）？鄒不同意，表示認為在《中英聯合聲明》和一國兩制下，「除咗國防同外交之外，香港人理應係享有一系列嘅自主權」，法庭傳譯一度未能譯出《中英聯合聲明》，被告欄的林卓廷即說：「Sino British Joint Declaration 呀！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，認為中國與香港之間的關係，基礎是建基於《中英聯合聲明》，而一國兩制是源於兩地族群的利益和所擁抱的價值均不同，因此認為「除非落實雙普選，否則一國兩制都冇真正落實過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱明白香港民族與港獨分別-但不代表不會考慮建香港民族概念屬意圖顛覆政權&quot;&gt;官稱明白香港民族與港獨分別 但不代表不會考慮建香港民族概念屬意圖顛覆政權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指鄒可能是對、可能是錯，法庭毋須判斷，但鄒同意《中英聯合聲明》只是由英國和中國政府決定，而非香港人決定嗎？鄒說「呢個亦都係好多香港人耿耿於懷嘅地方」，李運騰即打斷指可以問下一議題，並指被告到底是否實際上推動香港獨立，或是一個當前爭議的問題（live issue），問辯方是否需澄清。陳世傑續問鄒，香港獨立和自主權概念的分別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過陳慶偉打斷指認為已聽夠了，指辯方只是問同一問題，鄒家成亦只會重複答案，並指鄒已表示他不是提倡香港獨立、或香港應成為獨立的主權國（sovereign），只是認為一國兩制無按《中英聯合聲明》完全落實、香港無被給予完整的自主權；不過陳慶偉亦指，李運騰說法或許也有道理，因本案是控告被告意圖顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續補充，一如既往，無論控方或辯方證人的說法也不一定能當成真實（taken as face value）。而鄒早前稱「香港民族」與港獨「唔一樣」，陳慶偉指他們明白「香港獨立」和「香港民族」的分別，但與此同時，這不代表他們不會考慮，鄒為了建立香港民族理念，是意圖顛覆國家政權（“We are not saying that we would not take into the evidence that in order to build up the Hong Kong Ethnic idea, that he was intending to subvert the state power.”），指這是兩回事。陳世傑最後再問，鄒有否意圖提倡香港獨立，惟陳慶偉指鄒已答過他從無此意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;稱擁護基本法同時指屬殖民工具-鄒如忽略現實考慮-信仰只淪為自我麻醉&quot;&gt;稱擁護《基本法》同時指屬「殖民工具」 鄒：如忽略現實考慮 信仰只淪為「自我麻醉」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒昨供稱擁護《基本法》，惟法官李運騰指，鄒論壇亦提及「一國兩制、基本法、立法會通通都係精心設計嘅殖民工具」，與其說法如何一致。鄒說「呢個有啲複雜嘅，等我用好簡單嘅方式講解吓」，續指擁護或效忠是從「信仰」的角度去看，「信仰能否強化，必須結合現實嘅考慮，如果忽略現實嘅考慮，你嘅信仰只會淪為一種自我麻醉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，人大釋法和不落實雙普選，是令一國兩制、基本法和立法會被視為殖民工具的「條件」，他反對這些條件，並認為要落實雙普選，一國兩制、基本法和立法會「先至能夠產生佢哋本身應該產生嘅功能」，又指「當我哋見到佢落實得唔完美嘅地方，再受到我哋信仰嘅驅使，我哋先會調整我哋當下嘅決定，令到自己嘅信仰得以實踐」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問是否支持想像中基本法-鄒支持本身應該要產生嘅功能&quot;&gt;官問是否支持想像中《基本法》 鄒：支持本身應該要產生嘅功能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即鄒支持一個不存在的、或只存在於其想像中的《基本法》（exists only in your imagination）？鄒回應：「我係支持佢本身應該要產生嘅功能。」陳慶偉說，或許不是想像，而是鄒的解讀（interpretation），並舉例不同人對聖經也有不同解讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續指，鄒論壇提及立法會仍是港人「覺得要維護嘅一個制度」，李運騰問，即鄒對立法會功能和工作有自己看法，並認為當時立法會無行使其正當功能？鄒表示，議會理應產生的功能是「普世」的，就是「制衡行政機關」，但他之所以說是殖民工具，「係因為佢嘅制度並不民主，行政機關亦都會用一啲唔公義嘅手段去阻止人參選」，並依賴立法會「去落實好多損害香港人利益同意願嘅政策、法案、議案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇稱不再讓泛民繼續主導話語權-鄒指2020年世代更替下望改變立法會格局&quot;&gt;論壇稱「不再讓泛民繼續主導話語權」 鄒指2020年世代更替下望改變立法會格局&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡關注，鄒提到想以議會制衡，但論壇亦提及「更加重要就係唔可以再畀泛民主派繼續主導呢個香港嘅話語權」。鄒解釋，話語權是透過立法會原本的「反抗格局」而形成，如立法會只有泛民主派一把聲音，「市民大眾就會接收到啲乜嘢嘅聲音。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，當時是針對議會內議政內容的數量及質素，指如只是審視一些「鎂光燈」下的議案和法案，再加上提出的私人草案或修正案不足，「話語內容就會變得單調乏味」，故他一直望選出最多抗爭意志的代議士，就是「希望透過改變原本立法會入面嘅反抗格局，從而產生一股更加強大制衡行政機關嘅力量」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，即鄒認為傳統泛民主派做得不好，想有人取代他們？鄒答「有好有唔好」，並指「我認為當時時代嘅改變，市民大眾要求立法會議員做得更多……」李打斷指，簡言之當時泛民並非代表主流聲音，鄒不同意，指正因覺得他們「代表緊好多市民嘅聲音」，才說他們主導香港的話語權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問，但若大部分人支持傳統泛民，有什麼問題？鄒指：「2020年就出現緊呢個巨變」，簡單而言「係世代更替，經歷緊、演變緊、進化緊」。陳仲衡問，而鄒認為應由像他的人取代傳統泛民？鄒說：「我當然唔能夠取代，但我希望我係其中一把可以改變嘅聲音」，認為泛民「可以做得更好」，採取更主動的做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱2020年dq性質由阻港獨聲音改為阻民主派取35&quot;&gt;鄒稱2020年DQ性質由阻港獨聲音、改為阻民主派取35+&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鄒論壇提到：「我諗DQ喺2016年嚟講，嗰條實嘅紅線就係香港獨立吖嘛，而家政權就係阻止緊香港獨立嘅聲音去進入呢個議會。但係到今日2020年，呢一個DQ，已經唔再係阻止異見嘅聲音，佢係阻止緊香港人奪權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒解釋，「奪權」是指「奪取議會控制權」，而據2016年選舉經驗，DQ紅線是主張「香港獨立」的參選人，但2020年DQ性質已改為「要阻止民主派攞35+」、所有參選人都可能會被DQ，「因為有DQ嘅存在，我哋唔會攞到35+㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇稱入議會打交-鄒指意指自衛&quot;&gt;論壇稱入議會「打交」 鄒指意指「自衛」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了組織者籌辦的初選論壇，鄒家成稱於7月初亦出席了由將軍澳居民舉辦的新東初選民間論壇。鄒的 Facebook 於7月7日發布該論壇片段節錄，提及鄒被問到「有冇做開運動？入到議會會唔會打交？入到去最想揪低邊個？」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並於論壇回答：「如果你話喺入面揀一個對手去揪低佢呢，咁我諗，所有嘅親中派，每一個都應該我要砌低佢嘅」，又指「入去會唔會打交，呢一個唔單止係我鄒家成要做嘅事，係每一個今日參選嘅代議士都應該要做嘅事」，而就算有無《國安法》和以言入罪，每個代議士都應有心理準備「用任何手段，癱瘓每一個議會嘅進行」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒表示，「打交」是網民提問的用字，他的意思是「自衛」，當時腦海浮現陳志全被工聯會（郭偉強）使用暴力的畫面。李運騰指提問者顯然不是指「自衛」，鄒是迴避問題、不想得罪提問者？鄒指當時論壇講求「快問快答」，「真係冇咁多考慮」，而「打交」亦非他入議會的目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，帖文並非由他發布、是由團隊成員幫手，因該論壇「應該唔係咁多人睇」，他們想幫他「宣揚得遠少少」，印象中團隊發文前沒告知他，他翌日才知道。鄒又指，7月前所有 Facebook 帖文均由他或團隊另外一兩人幫手執筆，他全部知道亦同意，但7月起競選活動越來越多，故他很少處理 Facebook，當時亦無認為應移除帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇稱砌低每個親中派-鄒指望多方面取勝&quot;&gt;論壇稱「砌低」每個親中派 鄒指望多方面取勝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鄒稱要「砌低」每一個親中派，鄒解釋在議會辯論上、甚至長遠而言，「我希望佢哋喺場選舉會輸，即係多方面都希望可以贏佢哋。」被問是否指肢體暴力，鄒說：「如果受到襲擊，咁當然都包括埋啦，但我真係從來冇諗過要開開吓會，去主動冚佢（建制派）一巴咁……呢個太痴線喇」，有被告和旁聽人士輕輕發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇提癱瘓每一個會議-鄒稱望盡力阻惡法通過認誇張咗&quot;&gt;論壇提「癱瘓每一個會議」 鄒稱望盡力阻惡法通過、認「誇張咗」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「用任何手段，癱瘓每一個議會嘅進行」，鄒指是口誤，應是「每一個會議」，並笑言「『癱瘓』呢度個意思係阻止個會議進行啫，呢度的確係誇張咗」，又指要「癱瘓」會議是「因為惡法嚟緊」，但不是指《國安法》，而是議會內政府想推動的「惡法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，但鄒是提到「每一個會議」，意思是政府提出的所有議案也是惡法（evil）？鄒指整句意思是對其他參選人表達一個「期望」，即就算有《國安法》，入到立法會也要盡力阻止惡法通過，又望他們有心理準備、做心理建設，每個會議也有機會面對這種情況。鄒並重申提及「任何手段」和「癱瘓」，「係真係誇張咗」，「只係想表達大家要盡力去做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟法官陳慶偉指，鄒家成此前稱立法會是應除去的殖民工具，認為鄒並沒有誇張，實是與其證供符合。鄒回應，「除去殖民工具」是指「反對立法會被視為殖民工具的條件」，主要指不民主的制度和不公義的政治操作；至於阻止惡法「係喺呢一個體制之下會做嘅事情」，兩者有分別。陳仲衡亦指，鄒回答時無提及「惡法」，鄒同意，但指當時面對「入去會唔會打交」的問題時，已預設了是因推動惡法而出現「打交」的混亂場合。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續表示，就論壇發問完畢，會問及抗爭派記者會，但關注「共謀者原則」的應用，望再審視相關內容。陳世傑申押至明日續審獲法官批准，並預計明天會完成主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，鄒家成向步出被告欄的施德來說：「好攰呀！」，並向前彎身。&lt;/p&gt;

This article explores how the Russian armed forces have adapted traditional artillery practices to overcome challenges and achieve greater efficacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery is central to the Russian way of war, so it is beholden upon Western forces to properly understand how it has been applied in Ukraine. Russia’s artillery war is best analysed through two mechanisms: artillery doctrine – which provides the foundation for how artillery use has changed – and what artillery practitioners refer to as the gunnery problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gunnery problem is the same regardless of country, and describes the technical challenges involved in hitting a target with indirect fires. These challenges include accurate acquisition and use of meteorological data, which will impact flight path and speed; and survey data, which is critical to identifying where the firing gun is located and where it is pointing, as well as accurate location of the target. An additional element of the gunnery problem is calibration of the gun and ammunition. This involves measuring the temperature of the ammunition, the barrel wear, and the velocity of each shot if possible. If this information can be paired with sufficiently accurate target coordinates, an artillery battery will be able to fire for effect from its first rounds and will require fewer adjustments. The traditional approach without this is to fire rounds from a single battery and observe their deviation from the target. Corrections are made using forward observers, laser targeting systems and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery rounds will disperse along the range of fire as well as the line. The range refers to accuracy in front of or behind the target. Line refers to dispersion on either side of the target, as a result of which tube artillery produces a beaten zone that is approximately cigar shaped. It is important to understand the gunnery problem because it dictates what artillery forces must do to affect a target. The willingness of users to understand the gunnery problem, as well as doctrine, dictates efficacy. Because of this, the ability of the Russians to account for these technical limitations and achieve the commander’s desired effect provides a useful benchmark for Russian artillery efficacy in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;doctrine&quot;&gt;Doctrine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Russian forces manoeuvre to fire, Western forces fire to manoeuvre” is a neat encapsulation of Russian doctrine compared with the West. Put simply, Russia uses artillery as its primary form of lethality in the deep and close battles. Its combined arms elements are charged with positioning themselves so that the artillery can deliver destructive effects against their opponents. This is a high-level simplification, but it is an important distinction to make. For static operations, the Russian forces should be expected to control artillery centrally and coordinate its actions through the artillery chain of command. A defensive brigade should be assigned a brigade artillery group (BrAG) from its parent army, which consists of two battalions of self-propelled howitzers and a battalion of multiple rocket launchers. The available literature indicates that a BrAG would deploy 2–4 km behind the edge of the defence and occupy an area 3–5 km wide by 1–2 km deep. It would provide additional firepower over organic assets at the frontline to defeat enemy forces on the approach and if they broke through. It is also common for artillery formations up to a battalion to be attached to a tank or motorised rifle battalion and provide immediate fire support. Attachment indicates a strong command relationship and involves the combined arms commander directing artillery fire missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent analysis published by RUSI indicates that on parts of the frontline, Russia has not deviated from this concept. Two batteries of tube and one of rocket artillery were assigned to each battalion tactical group in the opening mobile phases of the conflict. The static nature of fighting that followed has led to the centralisation of artillery under artillery brigades. However, Ukrainian soldiers interviewed for this article indicated that Russian artillery units were laagered up to 12–15 km behind the frontline, and that they spend the night even further away. They only approach the frontline to conduct fire missions and withdraw as quickly as possible, indicating that doctrine on proximity has given way to concerns over survivability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While Russian artillery fire is highly effective, ammunition constraints combined with force dispersion have imposed limits upon its application and driven a reliance upon precision&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attachment of artillery formations to combined arms units is also discussed in Russian military journals covering the war. One article relates a case of an officer skipping the artillery commander altogether and sending his requests directly to battery commanders. This has resulted in articles explaining how a commander should designate and report targets directly to a battery commander. Another example reportedly involved “improvised mortar platoons”, which were temporary mortar teams established by a mechanised commander from regular infantry. This methodology provided immediately available fire support from three mortars that did not require additional clearance or process to fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gunnery-problem&quot;&gt;The Gunnery Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it therefore appears that Russian doctrine has been followed in Ukraine, this offers only a partial impression of the Russian artillery war. The methods used to address the gunnery problem help to complete the picture and indicate that Russian artillery fire is highly effective, although ammunition constraints combined with force dispersion have imposed limits upon its application and driven a reliance upon precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia entered Ukraine with several pre-established developments designed to improve artillery accuracy. One example is shock-fire tactics, a principle discussed in 2018, which employs UAVs, artillery-locating radars, tanks and artillery to coax an enemy into firing before conducting counter-battery fires. Shock-fire shortens the targeting cycle and improves the accuracy of fires by combining at least two forms of target location. It was developed through deployments in Syria and Ukraine. It has been used in some form in Ukraine, and Ukrainian artillery officers told RUSI that Russian counter-battery fire is very fast and accurate when conducted using artillery-locating radar and UAVs together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the system works, Russian targeting cycles can be completed in three minutes, while others take 30. The former is essentially the limit of what is physically possible – a 155mm shell fired to 25 km will take 75 seconds to reach the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reconnaissance-fire-system&quot;&gt;Reconnaissance-Fire System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reconnaissance-fire system (recce-fire) is a development of a Soviet-era concept designed to pair tactical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets with precision strike artillery in real time. Strelets is the implementation of this concept, connecting sensors to shooters in as close to real time as possible. Recce-fire requires the target to be engaged with precision munitions such as the 2K25 Krasnopol 152mm laser-guided round. Target designation can be provided by ground-based laser systems or the Orlan-30 UAV. Video footage showing precise strikes on Ukrainian vehicles or buildings is likely a result of Krasnopol use. Prior to the war, recce-fire was expected to be critical for counter-battery engagements. Ground-based laser targeting is evident, but some Russian documents indicate that the Russian armed forces have struggled to get forward observers to perform their role in Ukraine. Many prefer to use UAVs, a safer but potentially less effective solution. The efficacy of Krasnopol has also been challenged. One Russian textbook on artillery indicates that Krasnopol’s accuracy is severely degraded by low-hanging cloud cover, variable terrain and a host of other conditions that make it a difficult munition to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Russia has made extensive use of loitering munitions like Lancet-3, which can be coordinated with a separate UAV to conduct reconnaissance and targeting or flown manually to search for and strike individual targets. This is likely a response to several factors: Ukraine’s use of dispersed guns, the availability of Krasnopol and the associated targeting assets, as well as the presence of electronic warfare, which degrades Lancet considerably. Ukrainian commanders told the author that while Lancet is more prevalent in some areas than artillery, in others it is rarely seen. The use of Lancet also suggests that Russia has struggled to counter dispersion with its pre-existing targeting structures and doctrine. The gunnery problem means that while a single howitzer in a tree line might be quickly identified, the chances of hitting it with unguided munitions are low unless excessive mass is applied. When considered against the backdrop of Russia’s own ammunition challenges, the use of loitering munitions is therefore a logical alternative. However, the lethality of Lancet is often insufficient. it is apparent from videos that crews can hear the munition approaching, as they often have time to disperse before it strikes. One officer also said that although he had seen his gun “destroyed” several times online, it remained alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;weight-of-fires&quot;&gt;Weight of Fires&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional artillery practices focused on the weight of fires, which refers to the quantity, density and intensity of artillery fire required to achieve an effect. Accuracy is important – there is no point firing shells into an empty field – but only insofar as it ensures that most shells are having an impact upon the target. The proliferation of reconnaissance and precision strike assets has led Western artillery forces to focus on precision, leading to what Amos Fox terms the precision fallacy. Fox posits that precision strike munitions have led commanders astray with the promise of hitting a target. However, he notes that single precision munitions may fail to destroy their target because they lack the necessary lethality. Russian military academics have echoed this sentiment and note that artillery units have re-learned the value of the weight of fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Artillery is a formidable component of the Russian military, with occasionally best-in-breed targeting cycles and a doctrine that allows it to overcome deficiencies elsewhere&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soviet gunners were provided with targeting tables detailing the number of shells needed to defeat different types of targets. For instance, 12 122mm howitzers would require 600 rounds to engage enemy infantry across a 33-hectare area. All 600 rounds would be delivered in 15 minutes, showing the intensity of fire that is needed. Weight of fires is shaped significantly by physics and psychology. The first 45–60 seconds of a fire mission will generally drive infantry into cover, so Soviet and Russian gunners have focused on delivering most of the required ammunition in the first 5–6 minutes. Thereafter, the heat generated by the firing and repositioning of guns generally limits the rate of fire to 1–3 rounds per minute. Firing at a higher rate for longer would degrade the barrel and accuracy. So, to achieve the necessary weight of fires it is essential to ensure that there are enough guns available to engage the target, otherwise the necessary quantity and intensity of fires will not be deployed in the relevant timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian writers have emphasised this principle in journal articles, which suggest that Russian artillery may be struggling to achieve the weight of fires necessary to meet its doctrinal obligations. This may be a result of the extreme dispersion that is evident in Ukraine, as well as the lack of ammunition that has impacted more recent operations. Dispersion makes coordination of massed fires more difficult; in theory, systems like Strelets allow guns to disperse and fire on a single target, but they rely on good communications and training. Accuracy is improved through UAVs, but if Russian forces are struggling to concentrate their artillery, then one would expect their ammunition consumption to increase as they try to destroy targets with fewer guns available. Attrition also plays a role: Russia is likely to have lost many of its guns and most experienced crews. However, Russian attacks are often preceded by extensive indirect fire; Russia’s ammunition consumption and accounts from Ukraine both support this argument. Recent reports indicate that 70% of Ukraine’s casualties are a result of artillery fires. It is clear therefore that despite challenges, Russian artillery is having a significant impact on the Ukrainian armed forces and delivering effects through a combination of innovative tactics and technology, as well as a reliance upon its traditional doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-sum&quot;&gt;In Sum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief analysis of Russian artillery practice in Ukraine indicates that while it has demonstrated variable levels of efficacy, on the whole it is a formidable component of the Russian military, with occasionally best-in-breed targeting cycles and a doctrine that allows for artillery to overcome the deficiencies of Russian combined arms forces. It has built a significant ability to find and strike targets over a wide area, and likely retains the ability to mass fires against targets of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indirect fire support operates on mathematical principles of certainty. Approaches to this differ: Western forces, for instance, seek an economy of effort and resources in the application of fires. They tend to pay close attention to all aspects of the gunnery problem to ensure that their fires achieve effect with optimal ammunition consumption. The evidence from Ukraine suggests that Russian forces have combined both approaches: the use of UAVs, radar and precision munitions indicates that accuracy is essential for certain tasks, but attaining the weight of fires remains critical.&lt;/p&gt;

But the violence is assuming an uncontrollable momentum of its own, creating exponential difficulties for belligerents and peacemakers alike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 100 days in, Sudan’s conflict shows no signs of abating. Across the capital, clashes remain concentrated around Omdurman and Bahri, Khartoum’s sister cities, with a single airstrike killing at least 37 people and Grad rockets saturating residential neighbourhoods. Despite dwarfing Mohamed Hamdan “Hemmeti” Dagalo’s RSF, SAF is on the back foot after failing to relieve the disparate garrisons making up its frontline. Dismissed by many as a “vanity project”, a passable imitation of a working military, the army displays little of the capacity or doctrine necessary to sustain a counterinsurgency, having outsourced such functions to the very group it is now fighting. The top brass appears divided over operational planning, and morale among poorly paid ground-troops is often shaky. Perhaps as a consequence, heavily armed convoys from Hattab Camp were decimated along Al Ingaz Street, a major north-south artery, while trying to reach SAF’s beleaguered Signal Corps – the latest in a series of costly setbacks that have left much of the military’s senior leadership, including Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, seemingly cut off in the nearby General Command complex. With the defenders reportedly short on fuel, “even some army backers suggest the RSF [could be] on the cusp of a decisive victory”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not a foregone conclusion. Hemmeti’s supply lines are stretched, and SAF is still entrenched across Khartoum’s outskirts, with ready access to the Sudanese coastline and support infrastructure further north. Additionally, al-Burhan is only the face of a polycentric “khakistocracy”, a metropolitan syndicate of Islamist elites, corporate cronies and riverain officers – the so-called “community of the state” – desperate to preserve their privilege and social standing from rural revolutionaries. Should the compound fall, it is therefore entirely plausible that the conflict will grind on, bringing with it serious problems for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dangerous-refractions&quot;&gt;Dangerous Refractions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although possibly benefiting from a war of attrition in material terms, the military is experiencing existential pressures that will only worsen over time. Primarily drawn from Awlad Al-Bahr (Ja’aliyyin, Shaigiyya and Danagla) ethnic networks clustered along the Nile, SAF’s generals cast themselves as national custodians, an indispensable arm of the Sudanese state “mid-wifing” modernity, social consciousness and manifest destiny. But battlefield blunders and mounting casualties are taking a toll on their narrative. Having already urged retired soldiers to re-enlist, al-Burhan delivered another televised address in late June demanding a general mobilisation. Despite some evidence of refitted or newly deployed units, manpower shortages persist across the capital, leaving the army reliant on a variety of quasi and unofficial forces – former intelligence operatives, paramilitary groups like the Central Reserve Police, armed Islamists, and rumoured “Shadow Brigades” – to offset its losses. This dependency is not only damaging to SAF’s cohesion but anathema to its internal logic, accelerating the “fragmentation of sovereignty” Sudanese officers have long feared. By trying to reimpose some (imagined) monopoly over the use of violence, the army’s survival could paradoxically now be tied to a steady process of “militiafication”, leaving it one (depleted) security outfit among many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the RSF – a rudimental patchwork of militiamen – have carved out a comparatively strong position in recent months, drawing on fleets of “technicals” and a well-catered stockpile of weapons and munition – mortars, anti-aircraft guns, anti-tank missiles and drones – to consolidate control over most of central Khartoum. Supplemented by armoured vehicles from captured military bases, they can also deploy Man-Portable Air Defence Systems or “man-pads”, presenting a marked risk to civil and military aviation. Furthermore, Hemmeti enjoys strategic depth across South, West and Central Darfur, enabling his forces to conceivably hold out for years. But a protracted conflict raises other difficulties. Much of the RSF is incentivised by “money and clan solidarity [rather] than ideology”, and amid the polyglot membership produced by wartime recruitment, social revolution may not necessarily be bound up under the Dagalo brand alone. With SAF freezing the group’s bank accounts and constraining its cashflow, significant portions of this “force for hire” could become unmanageable, breaking off in pursuit of more lucrative opportunities. Signs may already be discernible as strains on RSF logistics exacerbate pillage and marauding, weakening Hemmeti’s half-baked populist appeal and driving the creation of several field courts to prosecute his own men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sudan’s upheaval should not be considered a binary contest between SAF and the RSF so much as a “welter of complex struggle”, integrating a raft of conflicts from the regional to the hyperlocal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, drawn-out hostilities in Sudan’s long-congested political marketplace are likely to accentuate a litany of smaller, localised disputes. Across “resource-rich, drought-prone” Darfur, fighting is assuming an ethnic flavour as Mahamid and Rizeigat gunmen – many affiliated with the RSF – attempt to capture land and water sources. Fur and Masalit civilians have been systematically targeted, with mass killings recycling the same “tactics, techniques and procedures” of the early 2000s. Reports describe not only the deliberate destruction of “homes, schools and hospitals [and] water, electricity and communications infrastructure”, but the torching of local markets and the palace of the Masalit Sultanate. Such is the scale of devastation that Khamis Abakar, Wali of West Darfur, was himself assassinated hours after condemning the attacks as a “genocide”. Police – often “outmanned and ill equipped” non-Arabs – have called on “their communities to arm and defend themselves” in turn, with some appealing to the army for support. Within months, cities like Al-Geneina hosted a medley of rival factions: former insurgents and signatories of the Juba Peace Agreement patrolled the eastern districts; much of the suburbs were ringed by Janjaweed; paramilitaries controlled the governor’s house; and SAF occupied the airport. This decentralisation of violence not only breeds a new crop of spoilers but generates its own momentum, further splintering Sudanese authority into “thousands of fragments and micro-powers of local character”. Porous boundaries; weak institutions; and shared kinship, patronage and political networks also mesh Saharan borderlands together, with Hemmeti’s Rizeigat tribe spanning western Sudan and Chad, and its wider fraternity – the Baggara confederation – stretching to Niger. As a result, conflict is readily exportable, raising the possibility of a regional conflagration that is exponentially harder to regulate or resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign meddling is already evident from reports of Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar – a beneficiary of RSF support during his assault on Tripoli in 2019 – supplying Hemmeti with hardware, medicine and fuel. The US likewise accused the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary company, of exporting surface-to-air missiles from the Central African Republic. Even those nominally pushing for peace have picked sides, with Cairo remaining a staunch supporter of al-Burhan, partly due to close structural linkages with the Sudanese army and a pressing need for allies in negotiations over Ethiopia’s Renaissance Dam. Certain analysts are even going as far as to suggest that Egyptian fighter jets have directly participated in SAF’s bombing campaign. Similar – if more covert – dynamics are playing out in the Gulf. In theory, Saudi Arabia and the UAE share little interest in a prolonged conflict after years of tying over the Sudanese state – and coterminous systems of graft and patronage – with loans, rents and aid. In November 2022, Riyadh’s Public Investment Fund pledged $3 billion to improve economic infrastructure across Khartoum, while months earlier, the Emiratis stumped up $6 billion in construction projects, agriculture and deposits for the Central Bank. Consequently, both – as members of the Quad (alongside the US and UK) and the Arab League – have pushed for a ceasefire and immediate humanitarian access. But many dismiss the UAE’s credibility as a “neutral arbiter”, given Dubai’s regular consumption of Sudanese gold and ongoing ties to RSF companies and media outlets. In April, for instance, footage surfaced of the group using thermobaric shells that reportedly trace back to UAE stockpiles, leading some to speculate that the “Abu Dhabi Express” – a complex web of commercial proxies and illicit arms flows – could in reality extend across Darfur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under such conditions, Sudan’s upheaval should not be considered a binary contest between SAF and the RSF – entities that are themselves volatile composites of different actors and interests – so much as a “welter of complex struggle”, integrating a raft of conflicts from the regional to the hyperlocal, which proliferate far beyond the immediate control of either al-Burhan or Hemmeti. This is not to deny agency or culpability for war crimes and well-documented atrocities, but reflects the increasing difficulty of delivering solutions that can sufficiently address the centrifugal propensities of long-running violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;immediate-priorities-and-cautionary-tales&quot;&gt;Immediate Priorities and Cautionary Tales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A credible ceasefire is, of course, paramount. Over a third of Sudan’s population was aid-dependent before the fighting, and an additional 3.3 million are now displaced. Internally displaced persons, refugees and migrants – many of them itinerant farm-hands – face not only insecurity but diminishing labour demand and little in the way of reliable transit, cutting off incomes as market prices “sky-rocket”. The World Food Programme anticipates around 2.5 million more people will experience “acute hunger” in the coming months, pushing the country to a “record high”. Crucially, Susanne Jaspars and Lutz Oette also describe a shift in the “nature and scale” of the crisis, increasing deprivation across urban communities and leaving the conventional modalities for emergency relief obsolete or insufficient. Additionally, international supplies are largely confined to Port Sudan, awaiting clearance from the notoriously apathetic Humanitarian Aid Commission, a regulatory body allegedly associated with Sudanese Military Intelligence. With civil service salaries unpaid and local law and order collapsing, there is not enough capacity or infrastructure to offset these blockages. Where alternatives have been found, either via resistance committees or improvised administrative solutions, they continue to be waylaid or completely derailed by violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The focus on high-level brokerage neglects the breadth, complexity and dynamism of grievances only loosely affiliated with the war’s “master-cleavage”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, external negotiations have understandably focused on suspending hostilities, delivering aid and demilitarising “hospitals and essential public facilities”, albeit to little avail. Among these pressing needs, however, it is vital that mediators avoid their past follies when engaging the “men with guns”. A demoralising track record of foreign peace-making in Sudan not only features the Framework Agreement but stretches back to the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement and various initiatives in the 1990s, which saw elite-centric bargains repeatedly “displacing civil politics and raising the … currency of violence”. In the process, these “make-do outcomes” tended to side-line or quash the very civic activism necessary for helping peace stick, reproducing (and entrenching) the same structures of violence that precipitated conflict in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, there seem to be encouraging lessons already being learned. The imposition of US sanctions on Al-Junaid, Tradive General Trading LLC, and parastatals like Defence Industry Systems and Sudan Master Technology conforms with recommendations made by NGOs and advocacy groups, as does the appointment of a dedicated Special Envoy from Washington. High-level diplomats routinely emphasise the importance of “civilian leadership”, and there is belated interest in supporting resistance committees. But platitudes and standalone policies do not translate into a “practical plan” for resolving the conflict. Though the UK and EU are launching similar financial measures, it is doubtful that they will find traction without buy-in from the UAE, or be able to stem “localised outbreaks of fighting and Arab mobilisation” across Darfur. At the same time, UK and Emirati officials resented being initially left out of US-Saudi negotiations, undermining the Quad’s collective relevance, and there remains little convergence between the “military-focused” Jeddah talks and parallel diplomatic tracks fronted by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the AU, Egypt and Chad. Without harmonisation, or at least efforts to shore up better coherence, international engagement could very quickly become “quixotic”, if not completely redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus on high-level brokerage also neglects the breadth, complexity and dynamism of grievances only loosely affiliated with the war’s “master-cleavage”. As SAF and the RSF increasingly resemble fragile coalitions, dealings between Hemmeti and al-Burhan may have no real bearing on the myriad of private conflicts now shaping Sudanese violence. As a result, conflict resolution is unlikely to work if involving the generals alone and could undermine much-needed atrocity prevention if “massacres and war crimes…[are] ignored under the exigencies of peacemaking”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although a renewed appetite for dialogue is emerging, Sudan’s so-called strongmen are caught in a self-destructive strategy, undermining their own authority as they try to build leverage for a carousel of negotiations. In the process, fighting is becoming ever more diffused, distorted and unstable. While a ceasefire is therefore imperative, it is not enough: mediators need a plan for what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;《國安法》頒布後一度考慮退出初選 鄒家成哽咽稱「做唔出」、「無法離群眾而去」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sKnJYrG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（8日）踏入審訊第101天。鄒家成繼續作供，表示《國安法》頒布後曾考慮退出初選，因當時與團隊研究條文，判斷參選人最多只因過往言論有機會被捕，而他過往對體制及政府批評較「尖銳」，「香港民族主義」亦可能被扭曲成分裂國家和港獨言論，加上條文「涵蓋範圍好廣、字眼好模糊、刑罰好重」，如「盲人摸象」。惟鄒指他終決定繼續參加初選，庭上哽咽稱：「我發覺我根本就做唔出退選嘅決定，我覺得我無法離群眾而去」。鄒續指，當時與團隊重新尋覓參選的意義，認為「繼續參選本身就係一個意義」，他亦商討如何調整競選工程以繼續參選，遂更改選舉口號和單張，將口號由「拒絕殖民 民族抗暴」改為「抗擊暴政 捍衛尊嚴」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就提名表格條款「擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特區」，鄒指他效忠的是理應能產生憲法應有功能的《基本法》，及「會受憲法約束」和「保障市民大眾權利」的政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引鄒家成3人向組織者發訊息-鄒稱由團隊成員草擬&quot;&gt;辯方引鄒家成3人向組織者發訊息 鄒稱由團隊成員草擬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成今第3天作供，辯方展示初選組織者 WhatsApp 群組訊息，顯示趙家賢於6月19日曾轉發署名為「抗爭派立場聲明書」發起人鄒家成、張可森和梁晃維，上款為「致初選籌組平台」的訊息，鄒指由張可森負責發出，由鄒其中一名團隊成員幫手草擬，他負責批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;該訊息提及3人發起聲明已逾一星期，共收到39位以上參與者以個人或政黨名義簽署，意味除民主黨、街工及社民連等外大部分人已簽署。聲明續提及「初選原設共同綱領，有意以『運用包括否決財政預算案之基本法賦予的立法會權力，迫使特首回應五大訴求。』的素人以及政黨因此共同目標而集結，期望以初選方式讓香港選民選出合適的代表披甲上陣。若無此共同綱領，恐怕初選只會淪為議席的『分餅機』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聲明又指，戴耀廷決定參與者毋須簽署共同綱領後，雖大部分參與者有簽署「墨落」重申堅定立場，但亦有原先出席協調會議的參與者明言杯葛初選。聲明又指協調會議的共識及「墨落無悔」亦包括認同若支持度不足須表明停止選舉工程，「這是否代表部分拒絕簽署聲明書的參選人可以無視我們早前的共識，甚至無視初選的結果？有見及此，希望初選主辦單位回應。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱如無法展現抗爭意志不如抽籤惟重申否決財案非協調共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱如無法展現抗爭意志「不如抽籤」、惟重申否決財案非協調共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成表示，當時着團隊成員按「墨落無悔」原文草擬一段訊息予初選籌組平台，告知他們有多少人已簽署，並就「墨落」的兩點聲明寫一些訊息，但無特別指明如何寫，「我由佢發揮然之後我再睇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續解釋訊息內容，指「墨落無悔」聲明運用否決權一點是想展現抗爭意志，「我哋認為如果無法向選民展現抗爭意志嘅話，呢個初選就失去一個意義，咁不如抽籤就算啦」，亦是上述恐怕初選只淪為議席「分餅機」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官李運騰關注，「初選原設共同綱領」一段似乎談及已達成共識的事項，鄒不同意，重申在新東並無就運用否決權達成共識；而「共同綱領」指協調會議上「原本傾過嘅嘢」，但不代表有達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱大黨不簽墨落令素人擔心參選無保障-望組織者提供保障&quot;&gt;鄒稱大黨不簽「墨落」令素人擔心參選無保障 望組織者提供保障&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於杯葛初選，鄒指記得當時新西協調會議，有街工的人想杯葛初選。法官陳慶偉問是否因街工認為不能否決有利草根的預算案？鄒說「應該唔係」，指爭議應是街工「好似係想輸咗初選都繼續選官方選舉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問，訊息是否想向組織者表達應有簽署的協議？鄒不同意，解釋是想發訊息予初選籌組平台，通知他們發起了「墨落」，而較關鍵信息是「墨落」的第二點（「認同若支持度跌出各預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」），因當時不少政治素人擔心，部分大黨不簽署甚至公開批評「墨落無悔」，到底是因為運用否決權一點、抑或是因為第二點，即他們初選落敗仍想繼續參加官方選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RUpiQQp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年6月19日，街工舉行記者會宣佈有意參選立法會，6月29日發佈聲明改為表示不會參選。（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指這些素人擔心參加初選「好似冇一個保障」，因此發訊息望平台能保障其他參加者。鄒並同意，他與張可森和梁晃維均是政治素人，也有相同擔憂，惟最終組織者並沒有回覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱簽署提名表格時無細心留意條款-理解目標為攞35&quot;&gt;鄒稱簽署提名表格時無細心留意條款 理解目標為「攞35+」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成確認，於6月20日提交初選提名表格。就表格第二段：「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」，鄒指理解是新東協調會議達成的共識，亦沒有將「民主派35+公民投票計劃」理解為一份文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡追問那他簽署時如何理解，鄒笑指「其實我當時冇細心睇呢句句子，我諗住簽個名就參加初選」，又指「我有留意到有呢句嘢喺度嘅，但我冇細緻去逐粒字睇呢一句」。鄒後在法官追問下指，理解「目標」為「攞35+」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問提名表格是否對鄒家成回應-鄒稱無將擔憂與提名表格聯想埋一齊&quot;&gt;官問提名表格是否對鄒家成回應 鄒稱無將擔憂與提名表格「聯想埋一齊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續提到，鄒家成3人此前發訊息要求組織者保障政治素人的利益，擔心傳統政黨參選人食言、初選落敗仍參加正式選舉，而提名表格第二段，字面上似乎就是回應此關注，問鄒為何不要求組織者澄清該點的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/31U5jsX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 左起：張可森、鄒家成、梁晃維（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒先回應嚴格而言，他們「冇要求佢哋要做一啲嘢去保障我哋，其實只係問吓佢哋，其他人係咪真係想反悔呀咁樣嘅啫」，又指「當時真係冇諗過」問組織者，因覺得部分傳統泛民主派食言「其實都係佢哋嘅事，初選籌組平台其實都好難控制佢哋嘅」，訊息「純粹係表達擔憂嘅啫」。陳仲衡指，但訊息提到望組織者回應，鄒同意，「但係佢哋最後冇回應。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，鄒稱組織者沒有回應，但提名表格第二段可能就是組織者的回應，再問鄒有否問組織者究竟談及什麼「共識」？又指區諾軒提過，如有人問他「目標」的意思，他會指是「共同綱領」文件，並問鄒是否明白。鄒回應：「盡力去理解啦，我理解阿陳慶偉法官你啱啱講嘅嘢，只不過係有人問初選平台嘅人，佢哋就會答啦」，但鄒表示：「我冇將當時關於 WhatsApp 入面個擔憂，同呢個 nomination form 聯想埋一齊， 我的確冇呢個聯想。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，即使當時有這個「小擔憂」，即其他參選人落敗或仍繼續參加官方選舉，「其實我都係會繼續參加個初選㗎喇」，而即使他們真的這樣做，「已經係初選完結咗之後嘅事喇，既然係咁，不如到時再算啦」，只是6月中時他覺得要向組織者表達此擔憂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱效忠理應產生功能的基本法會受憲法約束及保障權利的政府&quot;&gt;鄒稱效忠理應產生功能的《基本法》、會受憲法約束及保障權利的政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於提名表格第6點「我特此聲明，我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」，被問為何認同該點，鄒指《基本法》是香港的憲法，「憲法理應產生嘅功能係約束當權者嘅權力，同埋保障市民大眾嘅權利」，而他認為立法會議員所奉行的精神，與《基本法》理應要產生的功能是吻合，「我效忠嘅係會受憲法約束，同埋會保障市民大眾權利嘅政府。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，鄒有否區分《基本法》應該的說法，和實際上的說法（“… what the Basic Law should say or what the Basic Law in fact says”）？鄒指有。李再問，故鄒說擁護《基本法》，是擁護哪種《基本法》？鄒回答：「我覺得《基本法》喺香港嘅實踐係未如理想嘅。」惟陳仲衡即打斷，指問題並非《基本法》的實踐，又嚴厲指：「不要嘗試迴避問題，面對問題並回答，你有足夠的經驗知道你是否在回答我們的問題。（“You are experienced enough to know whether you are answering our question.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續回答：「我效忠一本，理應能夠產生憲法理應產生功能嘅《基本法》。擁護又好，效忠又好，我覺得係一個好私人嘅情感，同一個人嘅信仰係有密切嘅關係，你要強化一個信仰……」，惟陳慶偉打斷，指認為已聽夠了，指簡言之鄒是擁護他所相信的《基本法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱參選宣言無意圖顛覆政權-官稱帖文不證自明&quot;&gt;鄒稱參選宣言無意圖顛覆政權 官稱帖文不證自明&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就鄒家成 Facebook 帖文發問。就6月21日的〈繼承民族意志，掀起反殖浪潮——立法會新界東初選參選宣言〉，鄒解釋主要宣布會參加初選和交代政治理念。陳世傑問他想傳遞什麼訊息，惟法官陳慶偉指不認為需要問（go through that），認為帖文內容不證自明（self-explanatory）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問及「生於九七主權移交之年，自我有記憶以來，就只係不斷見證住香港嘅沉淪同赤化」中「沉淪同赤化」的意思，鄒向法官表示：「法官閣下，我知道你哋未必想我好詳細咁樣解釋呢個參選宣言，我用一個好簡短嘅方式快快趣趣講咗佢好冇呀」，被告席傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉笑說他完全明白鄒的聲明，只是辯方大狀問及字詞意思，並指除非字詞是模糊，否則會按字面理解，又指基本上「赤化」就是指「一國一制」、「香港成為中國的一部分」、「香港受共產黨管治」，指「我們全都知道那是什麼意思」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問，那鄒在帖文中的用字，有沒有意圖顛覆香港或中國政府？鄒說：「不論係呢度用嘅赤化又好、殖民又好，撕破畫皮都好，都沒有呢個意圖。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示6月25日帖文〈我只係一個普通香港人〉，指鄒昨提及「攬炒」的意思，並問帖文「同殖民者設計嘅議會制度攬炒到底」一句中，「攬炒到底」的意思與鄒昨提到的有否分別？鄒說「冇分別，『攬炒』同我主張嘅議會抗爭，同剛才嗰篇嘅參選宣言入面嘅『撕破畫皮』，同埋『衝擊體制』一樣意思」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱國安法頒布後曾考慮退出初選-指字眼模糊刑罰重如盲人摸象&quot;&gt;鄒稱《國安法》頒布後曾考慮退出初選 指字眼模糊刑罰重如「盲人摸象」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示「35+計劃新東信息發布區」群組紀錄，顯示由6月24日設立，鄒家成同日加入，但於7月2日退出。被問為何退出，鄒指「因為《國安法》頒布之後，我諗過退出初選」，並指基本上是6月30日《國安法》頒布後已「諗緊呢件事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問鄒做了什麼，鄒說「交代少少個背景啦，可能有少少長」，陳問：「可以簡短嗎？」，庭上傳出笑聲，鄒說「盡力」。鄒續說，6月30日晚擺完最後一個街站後，他返回辦公室，與選舉團隊一起等待《國安法》條文，至晚上11時他們已立即看條文，「我哋研究過《國安法》條例，當時嘅判斷係，參選人最多只係因為過往嘅言論而有機會被捕。」陳世傑指這是鄒的恐懼，陳慶偉說或是鄒的印象，鄒說「可以咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，他其後與團隊研究過往發表的言論，覺得過往對於體制和政府的批評都「比較尖銳」，加上當時認為「香港民族主義」有機會被扭曲成「分裂國家」和「港獨」的言論，亦因覺得《國安法》「涵蓋範圍好廣、字眼好模糊、刑罰好重，情況如同盲人摸象」，「所以睇完之後，我一度考慮緊係咪要退出初選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱發現根本做不出退選決定-我覺得我無法離群眾而去&quot;&gt;鄒稱發現根本做不出退選決定 「我覺得我無法離群眾而去」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問那他決定是？鄒家成說：「繼續參加初選。咁中間發生嘅嘢我唔詳細去講，主要就係處理完情緒之後，恢復咗思緒……」，說罷微微低頭沒有作聲。陳說：「你選擇繼續（“You decided to press on.”）」，鄒停頓一兩秒後抬頭，略哽咽說「係」，並清了兩下喉嚨。陳續問，而鄒7月2日退出群組時，仍在考慮是否繼續初選？鄒再略哽咽說：「當時考慮緊」，身旁的法庭傳譯主任遞上紙巾，鄒輕輕擦拭眼和鼻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示7月5日〈對不起，我回來了〉，問是什麼帖文，鄒續哽咽說：「簡單嚟講，我喺考慮緊初選嘅時候，我發覺我根本就做唔出退選嘅決定，我覺得我無法離群眾而去」。鄒續說：「總之有一晚我就打電話比我團隊嘅成員，我就同佢講，不如繼續，咁佢就話『全部人都ready，爭你一個』，咁我就同佢講，咁你幫我 call 齊人，第二日開會，我今晚返屋企準備一下」，鄒說時聲線持續微微顫抖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱認為繼續參選本身就是意義-國安法後改用較溫和口號&quot;&gt;鄒稱認為繼續參選本身就是意義 《國安法》後改用較溫和口號&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續說，團隊其後開會，主要談及兩件事，他欲談及第一件事時，陳慶偉打斷稱不認為需深究，總之最後鄒決定繼續參選。陳世傑問，但鄒有否做什麼改善在《國安法》下的處境？鄒聲音開始平復：「我下一句就準備講喇，我哋重新尋覓繼續參選嘅意義啦，我哋認為繼續參選本身就係一個意義」，而第二項討論就是「如何調整個競選工程，繼續參選」，他們遂更改了選舉口號和調整一些選舉單張。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 鄒家成（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒遂確認，他將口號由「拒絕殖民 民族抗暴」改為「抗擊暴政 捍衛尊嚴」，解釋想盡量避免用一些可能會被認為「好尖銳」、或「可能會被扭曲成會違反《國安法》」的字眼。陳世傑問是用較溫和（softer）的字眼？鄒說「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉說，認為「抗擊暴政」和「民族抗暴」意思大致一樣（more or less the same），但理解鄒是想要令口號變得更溫和（tone down），並問鄒何時決定改口號。鄒說7月5日〈對不起，我回來了〉的文章，可理解為「我正式決定繼續參選嘅一個時間點」，他亦是在當時更改口號。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後就該帖文發文，呈堂文件呈黑白，左上角寫有「Telegram」，法官李運騰一度稱該帖文在 Telegram 發布。鄒指左上角的「Telegram」字眼只代表「我開緊 Facebook 前一個 app，我用緊 Telegram」，而「眼前見到呢個 page 其實係 Facebook嚟嘅」。法官陳慶偉其後下令休庭，明續就該帖文發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成步入被告欄前，向旁聽親友說：「好渣呀真係！」，又笑說：「Sorry, unexpected.」，親友發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France’s relationship with Niger has been anchored by their mutual need – France’s demand for uranium and Niger’s dependence on France’s financial support and military protection. Niger is the source of a substantial portion of the EU’s uranium imports and meets 15% of France’s uranium requirements as well as a fifth of Europe’s uranium needs. This symbiosis, however, is strained with the advent of the coup, challenging France’s continued relevance and influence in Niger and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coup is the physical manifestation of the simmering resentment against “Françafrique”, the contentious economic and diplomatic ties between France and its former African colonies. This isn’t just an outpouring of the Nigeriens’ frustrations; it reflects the broader African sentiment against perceived neo-imperialism. France’s controversial military operations in the Sahel region, including Serval and Barkhane, have not only been ineffective in curbing jihadist insurgency but have indirectly fueled their growth. As Gérard Araud, a former French ambassador, aptly remarks, “every liberating army becomes, after a while, an occupier.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contemporary crisis also exposes the EU’s ambiguous Africa strategy. The EU is at a crossroads – escalating tensions in Niger could potentially discourage it from imposing sanctions on Russia, a key uranium supplier, thereby compounding the bloc’s dependence on foreign resources. It’s not just about immediate uranium supply; it’s about reassessing the EU’s broader relationships and strategies in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-approach-in-africa&quot;&gt;Russia’s approach in Africa&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Europe grapples with the reverberations of its colonial past, another power has stealthily navigated the African political waters, extending its reach and consolidating its influence. This is Russia, operating under the banner of anti-neocolonialism and led during many years by the shadowy businesses of Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has massively funded disinformation campaigns in Africa, and supported by its Wagner Group, who has woven its web across Africa, securing interests and leveraging instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s renewed focus on Africa was clearly exhibited in the Russia-Africa summit in Sochi in 2019, and more recently, in St. Petersburg. Russia paints itself as the sturdy backbone of African security. Here, Putin brilliantly exploited soft power, offering debt relief and humanitarian aid to African nations while positioning Russia as a counterbalance to Western influence. His anti-neocolonial rhetoric, combined with gestures of respect towards African sovereignty, are part of a shrewd strategy to recalibrate Africa’s geopolitical alliances. One of the most interesting outcomes of the recent 2023 Russia-Africa Summit was the agreement on the creation of a new permanent Russian-African security mechanism, aimed at combating terrorism, extremism, transnational crime, and ensuring food security. Offering both training to African servicemen and law enforcement and supply of weapons – occasionally gratis – to strengthen African sovereignty and to save African leaders from the pain of former colonial powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wagner Group’s actions in Africa reflect the complexity of Russia’s strategy. It has been instrumental in advancing Russian interests in nations like Mali and the Central African Republic, but recent events suggest it might be asserting its own agenda, independently of the Kremlin. The Wagner rebellion fiasco raises questions about the dynamic between Putin and the private military company. Is Putin the puppet master, or is the Wagner Group a beast too big to control?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coup in Niger presents a compelling case study in this narrative. The sight of Russian flags waved by coup supporters was an ominous sign of shifting alliances. While there’s no concrete evidence of Wagner or Russia directly instigating the coup, their potential gain from the ensuing instability cannot be ignored. Prigozhin’s offer of Wagner’s services to the coup leaders adds another layer to this geopolitical puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;piecing-the-geopolitical-puzzle-together&quot;&gt;Piecing the geopolitical puzzle together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation demands a deeper understanding of the multi-faceted approach of Russia and the Wagner Group in Africa. Each coup, every summit, each show of support or condemnation forms a piece of a grand geopolitical jigsaw puzzle. Russia’s growing influence in Africa, like the mythical Hydra, seems to thrive amidst chaos and uncertainty. However, each new head of this Hydra that emerges offers an opportunity for vigilance and comprehension of Russia’s complex and ever-evolving strategy in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent coup in Niger was not an unforeseen event, but a climactic endpoint of an ongoing political tension that had been building for months. Niger, one of the only two non-military regimes in the G5 Sahel, was balancing on the edge of a precipice, mired in corruption and insecurity. Whispers of a coup had been circulating since February, with the turning point coming from within the presidential guard, instigating other factions to seize control. The capital, Niamey, more exposed to jihadist attacks than its G5 counterparts, buckled under the strain of constant threats and the influx of displaced residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interpret this coup as a step backwards in democracy, but for a nation worn out by years of corruption and mismanagement, it serves as a necessary reaction. It is a bleak tableau where jobless youth and impoverished rural communities are the hardest hit. In such a scenario, any change, including a coup, signals a potential for much-needed reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst Niger’s political tumult, a stark resentment towards France is fuelled in Niamey. While ECOWAS condemns the coup, the West grapples with a diplomatic quandary: how to assist without colonial echoes. Anti-French sentiment, amplified by Russian influences, is not inherently anti-European. The West must pivot: the diplomatic roadmap ahead calls for the West to prioritise authentic partnerships over paternalistic approaches. There must be a shift from merely offering aid to fostering mutual understandings, from imposing conditions, to soliciting African-led solutions. The tri-border region, a migration and extremism nexus, demands stability, especially in the tri-border area of Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso, crucial for migration routes and vital to countering extremism.Ultimately, the coup in Niger serves as a wake-up call to the international community. It underscores the urgent need for a comprehensive reassessment of relationships with Africa, to move away from the shadows of colonialism and towards equitable partnerships. It also highlights the need to carefully dissect Russia’s sophisticated approach in Africa, which challenges the status quo and dictates the need for a coordinated international response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every move and countermove in this intricate game of geopolitics, the international community must remain alert and adaptive, ready to confront Hydra’s next gambit. After all, it is not just about surviving the immediate storm but navigating the complex currents of power, influence, and survival in a world that continues to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomatic recalibration is not a choice, it is a must.&lt;/p&gt;

The continued economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, China’s more insular nationalism, the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and widening U.S.-China strategic competition are shuffling U.S. and Chinese comparative advantages across the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local attitudes toward the United States and China — and views of their respective strategic and economic roles in the region — are a vital component in this strategic competition. They constitute the metrics of soft power and influence and need to be considered when predicting where regional governments are likely to align on any given issue. But there are huge gaps in country-by-country opinion polling on these fronts, and there has been little rigorous analysis of the elite and public opinion polls that do exist. Instead, policymakers in Washington and regional capitals alike tend to make assumptions about Southeast Asian opinion using anecdotes or tiny elite samples, often from just a couple of countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper collates and weights available country-level polling data to provide a more rigorous assessment of elite and public opinion regarding the United States and China. To find comparable data across a range of polls, the analysis is limited to just three questions for both public and elite opinion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do the (elites/public) of this country have warmer feelings toward the United States or China?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which of the two do they consider the most important strategic power in the region?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which do they consider the most important economic power in the region?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these assessments is assigned a level of confidence — low, medium, or high — based on sample size, national representativeness, and volatility in the available polling. The table below shows the assessments that can be made with medium or high confidence. In all other cases, there has either been no polling or assessments can only be made with low confidence — meaning pronouncements that “Country X thinks Y” should be treated with skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ErMwqfj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Southeast Asian Public and Elite Opinion toward the United States and China.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: P indicates public opinion, E indicates elite opinion. Source: Author’s analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each country section below details the available polling, along with a brief overview of the state of U.S. relations and a survey of relevant economic indicators to provide context for some of the polling data. In all cases, China is the leading trading partner (often by a very wide margin) and in many cases the leading investor. The United States is a significant provider of development assistance as defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but this pales in comparison to the trade and investment figures, as well as nontraditional loans and other forms of assistance. This economic imbalance is reflected in public and elite opinion that China is the leading economic power in the region — a finding shared in every country for which there is sufficient data, except the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to assume that in most of the countries for which there is insufficient data, publics and elites would identify China as the region’s leading economic power. But no such assumptions can be made about which nation they would deem the region’s leading strategic power or which they have warmer feelings toward. In the available data, Chinese economic influence is not correlated either positively or negatively with overall public and elite attitudes toward it, nor are public and elite feelings about China and the United States necessarily aligned. Of the three countries for which the data allows confident assessments, public and elite preferences for one power over the other only align in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS Southeast Asia Program hopes to expand this research in the future with additional polling data and other indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;public-opinion&quot;&gt;PUBLIC OPINION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For public opinion polling, this white paper relies on a range of surveys conducted either by international organizations that cover a broad span of countries or country-specific public opinion survey institutions or think tanks. Both use nationally representative samples and are generally reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that most public opinion polls are country-specific limits their utility for cross-country assessments of attitudes toward the United States and China. The surveys ask different questions of respondents, many of which are rooted in specific cultural or linguistic contexts. This is why the analysis in this white paper is limited to just three broad questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/interactives/international-methodology/all-survey/all-country/all-year/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pew Global Attitudes survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled nationally representative samples of 1,003 adults in Malaysia and 1,001 in Singapore. The margin of error was 4 percentage points in Malaysia and 3.7 percentage points in Singapore. The 2019 Pew Global Attitudes survey polled a nationally representative sample of 1,035 adults in the Philippines with a margin of error of 4.3 percentage points. Findings from these surveys are treated with high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2017/08/01/globally-people-point-to-isis-and-climate-change-as-leading-security-threats/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pew Global Attitudes survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled a nationally representative sample of 1,000 adults in Vietnam. The margin of error was 5.2 percentage points. Findings from this survey are treated with medium confidence because of their age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 &lt;a href=&quot;https://6389062.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6389062/Canva%20images/Democracy%20Perception%20Index%202023.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Democracy Perception Index&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled 1,053 online respondents from Indonesia, 1,054 from Malaysia, 1,057 from the Philippines, 1,007 from Singapore, 1,051 from Thailand, and 1,053 from Vietnam. The poll was commissioned by the Alliance of Democracies and conducted by Latana, which describes itself as “an AI-powered brand tracking solution.” The sample sizes in each country were large enough to be statistically rigorous, and results for each were weighted by age, gender, and education level. But as an online-only poll that reaches respondents using third-party news, shopping, sports, and gaming apps and websites, its samples are unlikely to be as representative as those from traditional pollsters. The poll likely overrepresents those who are wealthier, live in urban and suburban areas, and are the most online. In addition, Latana does not make clear whether the polling questions were asked in local languages or only in English, and the exact role of its machine-learning technologies in collecting and analyzing results is unclear. For these reasons, the findings from this survey are treated with medium confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://interactives.lowyinstitute.org/features/indonesia-poll-2021/topic/global-powers-and-leaders/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lowy Institute’s 2021 Indonesia Poll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; surveyed a nationally representative sample of 3,000 Indonesian adults across every province. The margin of error was 1.8 percentage points. Findings from the survey are treated with high confidence except where a plurality of respondents chose “don’t know,” in which case they are treated with medium confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://merdeka.org/v2/download/china-poll-2022-report/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Merdeka Center’s 2022 public opinion survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on perceptions toward China polled a nationally representative sample of 1,204 adults across all Malaysian states, with a margin of error of 2.9 percent. Findings from this survey are treated with high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

Findings from this survey are treated with high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sws.org.ph/downloads/media_release/pr20230207%20-%20The%202023%20SWS%20Survey%20Review.pdf#page=27&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;December 2022 SWS quarterly survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled a nationally representative sample of 1,200 Filipino adults across all regions of the country, with a margin of error of 2.8 percent. Findings from the survey are treated with high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://egfound.org/2023/06/modeling-democracy-caught-in-the-middle/#Specific-Findings&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurasia Group Foundation’s 2023 survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled a nationally representative sample of 500 Singaporean adults and a sample of 500 Filipino adults representative of the online population in the country. Findings from this survey are treated with high confidence for Singapore, and medium confidence for the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion&quot;&gt;ELITE OPINION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to public opinion polling, elite opinion surveys center specifically on policy experts, academics, civil society representatives, business leaders, and in some cases, government officials. For elite opinion, this report relies mainly on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iseas.edu.sg/articles-commentaries/state-of-southeast-asia-survey/the-state-of-southeast-asia-2023-survey-report-2/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;State of Southeast Asia survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. ISEAS polls a mixture of academics, business leaders, civil society and media representatives, government officials, and personnel at international organizations. Its surveys are extremely valuable to policymakers and analysts of Southeast Asia, and they provide data points that cannot be found anywhere else. But as with any survey, it has its limitations and does not claim to be equally rigorous for every country in the region. To the contrary, ISEAS presents its results as a reflection of elite opinion in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as an institution, rather than that of Southeast Asia as a region or of its constituent countries. It drives home that point by weighting each country’s responses not by population or number of respondents, but as 10 percent of the total, reflecting their coequal status within ASEAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 ISEAS survey included 1,308 individuals, down from 1,507 in 2022. The largest number of respondents, 208, came from Singapore, where ISEAS is based. The smallest number, 99, came from the Philippines. In all other cases, the number of respondents was over 100. The size of these response pools relative to each country’s population, and therefore the extent to which they are representative of each country’s elite, varies widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no agreed-upon standard for how large a response pool must be for an elite survey to be considered representative. And given the nature of elite surveys, it is impossible to create truly representative samples. But as one point of comparison, the East-West Center’s 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://asiamattersforamerica.org/uploads/publications/2022-Asia-Matters-for-America-Public-and-Elite-Opinion.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asia Matters for America survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. government and business elites included 1,446 respondents, or 1 for every 230,000 Americans. For 2023, the ISEAS survey appears most representative of elite opinion in Brunei, where it surveyed roughly 1 out of every 4,000 residents, and Singapore, where it surveyed roughly 1 in every 30,000. Answers for these two countries are assigned a high confidence score in this white paper. After that, the ratio of respondents to population was about 1:75,000 in Laos, 1:125,000 in Cambodia, and 1:275,000 in Malaysia. These countries’ answers are assigned medium confidence scores except in cases of extreme year-over-year volatility, which reduces some to low confidence. Answers for the remainder of countries are assigned low confidence due to the small ratio of respondents to population, which was about 1:500,000 in Myanmar and Thailand, 1:740,000 in Vietnam, 1:1,200,000 in the Philippines, and 1:2,300,000 in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amadorresearchservices.com/publications/national-security-survey-2022%3A-results-%26-findings&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amador Research Services poll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the Philippines included 1,249 respondents, mainly from academia and the military or security services, with a much smaller number from civilian government, business, and civil society. It surveyed roughly 1 in every 90,000 residents of the Philippines, for which it is assigned a medium confidence score. By combining this with the ISEAS 2023 and 2022 surveys (the latter having surveyed 1 in every 285,000 residents, warranting a medium confidence score), it is possible to assess with high confidence whether Philippine elites have warmer feelings toward the United States or China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS Southeast Asia Program is aware of other elite opinion polling conducted in the region (e.g., the Foreign Policy Council of Indonesia’s annual ASEAN-China Survey) but none that ask comparable questions about both China and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessing-toss-ups&quot;&gt;ASSESSING TOSS-UPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper determines public opinion on each question to be a “toss-up” if the findings are within the margin of error. Since elite polls do not have margins of error, toss-ups are assessed if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the results for the United States and China on a given question are within 5 percentage points;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;different polling questions touching on the same issue provide contradictory answers; and/or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;responses to a specific question alternate between the United States and China in consecutive years. Responses that alternate in consecutive years between one power and a toss-up are still assessed to favor that power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For trade statistics, this report relies on the UN Comtrade Database. Where discrepancies exist between reported import and export flows between the United States, China, and Southeast Asian countries, this report relies on the figures reported by Southeast Asian countries; this not only allows for a common base from which the authors can assess Washington and Beijing’s trade engagement with a country relative to its overall trade balance, but one rooted in Southeast Asian economies’ perspectives. Meanwhile, for statistics related to foreign capital investment and aid, this report relies on the Lowy Institute’s Asia Power Index and Southeast Asia Aid Map, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brunei&quot;&gt;Brunei&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ ties to Brunei are underdeveloped, but the sultanate is a key partner in regional diplomacy and economic affairs; the 2021 Myanmar coup took place during Brunei’s chairmanship of the ASEAN, whose initial approach to the crisis was shaped by Bruneian interlocutors. In terms of economic affairs, Brunei remains forward-leaning on trade issues: It was a party to the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (P4) agreement that eventually expanded into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), is now a signatory to both the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and is participating in negotiations on the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no rigorous public opinion polling of Bruneian views on the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MS1DCIC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elite opinion surveys conducted by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore suggest an ongoing shift in Bruneian views among government, business, media, and academic experts toward power dynamics in the region. When asked about a hypothetical scenario in which the region was forced to align with one of the two strategic rivals, a slim majority of Bruneian respondents in the 2023 survey, 55 percent, selected China over the United States. This is down from 64.2 percent in 2022 — but the Bruneian sample size of 53 respondents in the 2022 survey was problematically small and should be treated with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a crosscutting piece of evidence, Bruneian elites in the ISEAS survey evinced more negative feelings about China than the United States. In 2023, 21.7 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a steep fall from the (again, to be treated skeptically) 67.9 percent who responded this way in 2022. Only 13.3 percent of respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to the 50.9 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruneian elite opinion is much clearer when it comes to which power has more influence in the region. Just 13 percent of respondents in 2023 identified the United States as holding the most political and strategic influence in the region, down from 34 percent the previous year. By contrast, 45 percent of respondents identified China as the primary political and strategic power in Southeast Asia, up from 39.6 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISEAS survey respondents were even more lopsided on economic issues. About 44 percent of Bruneian respondents viewed China as the most influential economic power in the region, though this is way down from 85 percent in 2022. By contrast, less than 7 percent identified the United States as the most economically influential in 2023, up from the 2 percent who said so in 2022. These sentiments accurately reflect China’s outsized role in Brunei’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 120 Bruneian individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to just 53 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-1&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the UN Comtrade Database, trade in goods between Brunei and the United States amounted to $230 million in 202l, or just 1 percent of Brunei’s trade volume that year. This was down from $359 million in 2019 and $373 million in 2020. Meanwhile, China’s trade with Brunei stood at $2.8 billion in 2021, or approximately 14 percent of the sultanate’s total trade that year. This is a sharp increase from $1.1 billion in 2019 and $1.75 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also Brunei’s most important source of foreign direct investment, according to the Lowy Institute’s Asia Power Index, accounting for an astounding 94 percent of the country’s inbound foreign capital investment between 2012 and 2021. By contrast, the United States accounted for only 1 percent of all foreign capital investment into Brunei over that period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brunei does not currently receive Official Development Assistance (ODA) from the United States, as categorized by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD. China does not provide ODA in the traditional sense but does offer loans and other assistance that may be interpreted as aid by recipient governments and publics. According to the Lowy Institute’s Southeast Asia Aid Map, between 2015 and 2021 China spent and committed $1.08 million in assistance to Brunei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cambodia&quot;&gt;Cambodia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia and the United States have maintained a strained, often tense relationship in the decade since Prime Minister Hun Sen cracked down on political opposition, independent media, and organized labor in the country. The deteriorating state of human rights and democracy in Cambodia, exemplified by opposition figure Kem Sokha’s recent sentencing to 27 years’ house arrest under spurious charges of treason and the banning of the opposition Candlelight Party ahead of national elections, complicate Washington’s efforts to forge closer ties with Phnom Penh. And while the United States should continue to emphasize human rights concerns in its engagement with Cambodia, it also should constructively engage with Cambodian leadership, not least because of the kingdom’s growing political and economic reliance on China. This reliance — and the perception that Cambodia has irrevocably aligned itself with China — masks the fact that Phnom Penh still sees significant value in enhancing ties with Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no rigorous public opinion polling of Cambodian views on the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion-2&quot;&gt;Elite Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1R67Lkc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute’s 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey provides a window into the thinking of at least some Cambodian elites. Surprisingly, 73 percent of Cambodian respondents selected the United States when forced to choose between one or the other great power. This was one of the highest levels of elite support for the United States among the countries surveyed by ISEAS — and a complete reversal from 2022, when only 18.5 percent of Cambodian respondents chose the United States. Such a huge swing in opinion needs to be taken with an equally large measure of caution. Rather than signaling a radical shift in worldview within Phnom Penh’s elite circles, it seems more likely that respondents are treating the question as a barometer for their feelings about recent events, such as Hun Sen’s 2022 visit to Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 18.6 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a slight increase from the 17.2 percent who responded this way in 2022. In contrast, among Cambodian elites in 2023, only 9.7 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to the 28.4 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other responses to the ISEAS survey were more consistent over time and therefore seem more illuminating. A meager 17.9 percent of elites surveyed in the 2023 survey identified the United States as the most important political and security power in the region, compared to 17.3 percent in 2022. This stands in contrast to the 72.4 and 75.3 percent of elites who identified China as the most significant political and security power in 2023 and 2022, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, 75.4 percent of Cambodian respondents identified China as the predominant economic power in Southeast Asia. This was the largest share of any country in the region and reflects Cambodia’s growing economic dependence on China. This figure represents a slight dip from 84 percent in 2022 but still far surpasses the percentage of respondents who believe the United States is the predominant economic power in the region (2.2 percent and 4.9 percent in 2023 and 2022, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 133 Cambodian individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 80 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-2&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary U.S. economic weakness in Cambodia is investment — not trade, where it remains competitive. Trade in goods between Cambodia and the United States amounted to $7.8 billion in 202l, or 17 percent of Cambodia’s trade volume that year. This is a substantial increase from $4.7 billion in 2019 and $5.6 billion in 2020. China’s trade with Cambodia stood at $11.2 billion in 2021, or approximately 24 percent of the kingdom’s total trade. This is up from $8.6 billion in 2019 and $8.2 billion in 2020. But the directionality of Cambodia-U.S. and Cambodia-China trade is reversed. An overwhelming majority of Cambodia-U.S. trade — $7.5 billion out of $7.8 billion in 2021 — consists of Cambodian exports to the United States. By contrast, Cambodia exported just $1.5 billion in goods to China in 2021 while importing $9.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2012 and 2021, U.S. foreign capital investment into Cambodia amounted to just 5 percent of the country’s inbound foreign investment. China accounted for 24 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $912 million and committed $1.04 billion in assistance to Cambodia between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $4.27 billion and committed approximately $6.25 billion in assistance to Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indonesia&quot;&gt;Indonesia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guided by its longstanding “free and active” foreign policy and history of nonalignment, Indonesia has sought to maintain balance in its relations with Washington and Beijing. While the presidency of Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has seen significant developments in Sino-Indonesian cooperation, primarily due to congruity between the president’s development and infrastructure agenda and Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, Indonesia has also boosted security ties with the United States and its allies. This includes Indonesia’s participation in the Garuda Shield exercises, which expanded last year to the Super Garuda Shield, now “one of the biggest joint, multinational exercises in the Indo-Pacific region.” Yet while the Indonesian public is more inclined toward the United States than China, Indonesian strategic elites appear more divided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;public-opinion-3&quot;&gt;Public Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nsXtnh1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lowy Institute’s Indonesia Poll 2021, a nationally representative survey of Indonesian public opinion, demonstrates a modest preference for the United States among the public. Only 42 percent of respondents trusted China to act responsibly in the world, a decline of 18 points since 2011, while approximately 56 percent signaled that they trust the United States, a decline of 16 points over the past decade. However, the surveys were taken 12 years apart, so there have probably been a lot of ups and downs not captured in those numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has risen to the top of the Indonesian public’s threat perception, with 49 percent of respondents believing that China poses a threat to Indonesia over the next 10 years. And when asked to rank perceptions toward countries on a “feelings thermometer” scale ranging from 0 degrees (coldest feelings) to 100 degrees (warmest feelings), Indonesian respondents ranked the United States at 60 degrees and China at 53 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked which country will be the leading military power in Asia in 20 years, 36 percent of Indonesians identified the United States, down from 58 percent in 2011. Just 22 percent expected China to be the region’s leading military power, largely unchanged from 25 percent in 2011. Those who lost confidence regarding the United States moved to the “don’t know/refused” category, which accounted for 36 percent of responses, up from 11 percent in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarter of Indonesian respondents in 2021 expected the United States to be the leading economic power in Asia in 20 years, basically the same as the 23 percent who answered this way in 2011. Slightly more, 31 percent in 2021, expected China to be the leading economic power in 20 years, which is significantly less than the 52 percent in 2011. As with the question about military power, the number of Indonesians saying they don’t know which country will be the leading economic power leapt, reaching 36 percent in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to military and economic power, the Indonesian public seems to give a slight edge to the United States and China, respectively. But a plurality in both cases is unsure. This suggests that the balance of public opinion on either question could change; in fact, it may have already in the year and a half since Lowy conducted its last poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only other recent poll of Indonesian public opinion on China and the United States appears to be the 2023 Democracy Perceptions Index, conducted by Latana on behalf of the Alliance of Democracies. This online-only, artificial intelligence-driven poll is not as rigorous or representative as Lowy’s but provides useful data points. Respondents were evenly split, with 27 percent holding a positive view of the United States and 24 percent a negative view, for a net approval of +3 percentage points. In comparison, 27 percent held a positive view of China and 22 percent a negative view, for a net approval of +5 percentage points. This difference is within the margin of error, and nearly half of respondents held a neutral view or had no opinion about each power, making it a toss-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EaQFdH7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opinions of the Indonesian elites surveyed by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute are ambiguous and sometimes contradictory. They provide useful data points, but the sample sizes involved are not sufficient to assess Indonesian elite opinion with confidence. The 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey found that if forced to choose between major powers, only 46 percent of Indonesian respondents would side with the United States, down from 56 percent the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the same Indonesian elites evinced stronger negative feelings toward China than the United States. Approximately 57.8 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a slight rise from the 51.1 percent who responded this way in 2022. Meanwhile, 50.4 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” a difficult-to-explain swing from the 29.8 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, 35.5 percent of surveyed elites identified the United States as the most important political and security power in the region, effectively unchanged from 35.1 percent in 2022. Meanwhile, 29.8 percent of elites surveyed in 2023 identified China as the region’s primary political and security power, a fall from the 38.2 percent who responded this way in 2022. The narrow margins and year-over-year reversal of fortunes suggest these should be treated as a toss-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly 71.1 percent of Indonesian strategic elites surveyed by ISEAS in 2023 identified China as the most influential economic power in Southeast Asia (up from 67.9 percent in 2022), with only 5 percent selecting the United States (down from 8.4 percent in 2022). This is an accurate reflection of their respective levels of economic engagement in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 120 Indonesian individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 130 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-3&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Indonesia and the United States amounted to $37.1 billion in 2021, or 9 percent of Indonesia’s trade volume that year. This reflects a boost in trade flows between the United States and Indonesia, up from $27.2 billion in 2019 and $27.3 billion in 2020. But China’s trade with Indonesia, at $110 billion in 2021, was triple that of the United States and accounted for approximately 26 percent of Indonesia’s total trade. China-Indonesia trade rose sharply since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, up from $72.9 billion in 2019 and $71.4 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also lags far behind China on the investment front. Between 2012 and 2021, the United States provided foreign direct investment amounting to 8 percent of all of Indonesia’s inbound foreign investment. China more than doubled that, accounting for approximately 20 percent of inbound investment in that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $1.89 billion and committed $1.42 billion in assistance to Indonesia between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $15.1 billion and committed a whopping $18.2 billion in assistance to Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;laos&quot;&gt;Laos&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-Laos relations are underdeveloped, although Vientiane is an active player in both ASEAN and the latticework of Mekong-related subregional arrangements, including the Mekong-U.S. Partnership. Its proximity and economic exposure to China has led to assumptions that Laos is closely aligned with Beijing. This perception is heightened by Laos’s debt crisis, which is driven mainly by loans from China and gives Beijing enormous leverage over Vientiane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OaLxkas.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no rigorous public opinion polling of Lao views on the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion-4&quot;&gt;Elite Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ieeXnWk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISEAS 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey found that 59 percent of Lao respondents would favor the United States if forced to choose between the two major powers. This is a significant reversal from 2022, when only 18 percent responded this way. The scale of this shift warrants skepticism, especially because the size of the Lao response pool in 2022 was problematically small and more than doubled between the two surveys. It might indicate the directionality of a shift in Lao elite feelings about China or the United States but should not be taken at face value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came to negative perceptions, 16.8 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a significant drop from the 40.9 percent who responded this way in 2022. Only 5.6 percent of Lao respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 50 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just 13.1 percent of elites surveyed in 2023 identified the United States as the most important political and security power in the region, a slight increase from 9.1 in 2022. This stands in contrast to the 30.8 percent of respondents who believed that China is the most important political and security power, a steep decline from the 75 percent who responded this way in 2022. This nearly 45-point swing warrants caution, but the gap between the responses for China and the United States remains large enough to say with some confidence that Lao elites view China as the predominant strategic power in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 20.6 percent of Lao respondents identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, an immense drop from 86 percent in 2022. The enormity of this change is highly suspicious, especially given China’s continued economic dominance in Laos. Rather than an honest assessment of China’s economic power, respondents may have been signaling their growing unease with the degree of Vientiane’s dependency on Beijing amid the debt crisis. In terms of Lao views of U.S. economic influence, only 5.6 percent of respondents believed that the United States is the region’s predominant economic power, up slightly from 4.5 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 107 Lao individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 43 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-4&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Laos and the United States amounted to only $334 million in 2021, or 3 percent of Laos’s trade volume that year. This is a significant improvement from $108 million in 2019 and $155 million in 2020. But it is less than a tenth of China’s trade with Laos, which stood at $3.6 billion, or 27 percent of Laos’s total trade, in 2021. Trade volume between China and Laos that year narrowly exceeded its 2019 total of $3.4 billion after having fallen to $2.8 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is nearly as dominant on the investment front. It accounted for 25 percent of Laos’s inbound foreign capital investment between 2012 and 2021. The United States provided only 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $366 million and committed $427 million in assistance to Laos between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $6.48 billion and committed $8.08 billion in assistance to Laos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;malaysia&quot;&gt;Malaysia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-Malaysia cooperation remains robust, but domestic political instability and successive changes in government have impaired Washington’s ability to forge deeper ties with Putrajaya. Defense cooperation has become routinized, including through the Keris Strike and Bersama Warrior exercises, and economic cooperation remains a key area of opportunity, including through Malaysia’s participation in IPEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although views toward China have declined worldwide, nationally representative surveys conducted by Pew demonstrate that the Malaysian public generally favors China over the United States. Approximately 60 percent of Malaysian respondents in 2022 held favorable views toward China, compared to 44 percent who held favorable views toward the United States. And 62 percent of Malaysian respondents trusted Xi Jinping to “do the right thing regarding world affairs,” compared to 53 percent for Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Merdeka Center’s 2022 survey of Malaysian public opinion toward China found that approximately 39 percent of respondents viewed China favorably, compared to 45 percent with a neutral impression of China, and just 12 percent with a negative impression. Moreover, approximately 70 percent of respondents perceived the current relationship between China and Malaysia to be “good,” a slight increase from the 67 percent who responded this way in 2016. The Merdeka Center has not conducted recent public opinion polling of Malaysian attitudes toward the United States, but these results provide greater confidence in Pew’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2023 Democracy Perception Index, Malaysians were more evenly split. This poll found that 37 percent of Malaysian respondents held a positive view of the United States and 25 percent held a negative view, for a net approval of +11 percentage points. By comparison, 39 percent held a positive view of China and 26 percent a negative view, for a net approval of +14 percentage points. The difference is within the poll’s margin of error, making it a toss-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When forced to choose between the United States and China in the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 54.8 percent of Malaysian strategic elites selected China and 45.2 percent selected the United States. This is an inversion of 2022, when 43 percent selected China and 57 percent selected the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States does moderately better when it comes to negative perceptions. Approximately 48.4 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a slight decrease from the 51.1 percent who responded this way in 2022. In contrast, 38.7 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 34.1 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slim plurality of Malaysian respondents in 2023, 35.5 percent, believed that China is the predominant political and strategic power in the region, while 33.9 percent believed the same for the United States. This represents a decline for China from 51.1 percent in 2022 and an increase for the United States from 24.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 65.3 percent of Malaysian respondents believed China is the predominant economic power in the region, down from 72.6 percent in 2022. In contrast, just 13.7 percent of respondents believed the United States is the primary economic power in Southeast Asia, up slightly from 11.9 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 124 Malaysian individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 135 Malaysian respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-5&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China nearly doubles the United States in both trade and investment flows in Malaysia. Trade in goods between Malaysia and the United States amounted to $52.4 billion in 2021, or 10 percent of Malaysia’s total trade volume that year. This reflects a general upward trend in recent years, with trade up from $39.9 billion in 2019 and $42.6 billion in 2020. China’s trade with Malaysia stood at $101.6 billion in 2021, or approximately 19 percent of Malaysia’s total trade that year. That is a substantial increase from $76.4 billion in 2019 and $78.8 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of foreign direct investment, the United States accounted for approximately 15 percent of Malaysia’s inbound foreign investment between 2012 and 2021, while China accounted for 29 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $57.7 million and committed $79.1 million in assistance to Malaysia between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $4.96 billion and committed $17.1 billion in assistance to Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;myanmar&quot;&gt;Myanmar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. ties with the military junta in Myanmar have been all but nonexistent since the February 2021 coup. The United States has frequent informal engagements with the opposition National Unity Government (NUG) but limited contact with the various ethnic armed organizations and Peoples’ Defense Forces that make up the bulk of the country’s resistance forces. The junta has turned toward China — along with India, Russia, and a few others — in the face of isolation by the wider international community. China also maintains informal contacts with the NUG and some ethnic armed organizations, though probably with limited ability to reverse widespread anti-China narratives among the opposition. These shifts mean that the generals in Naypyidaw have shifted decisively toward Beijing, while most of the opposition likely prefers the United States. But given the civil war, these assumptions are impossible to test rigorously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CRRzMxu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There does not appear to be any rigorous public opinion polling of Myanmar views on the United States and China either before or since the coup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion-6&quot;&gt;Elite Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YtKzzvJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most elites polled by ISEAS in 2022 and 2023 were likely to have been either part of the civilian government ousted in 2021 or affiliated with media, academia, business, and nongovernmental organizations sympathetic to the opposition. They provide useful data points, but the sample sizes involved are not sufficient to assess Myanmar elite opinion with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When forced to choose between the United States and China in the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 67.8 percent of Myanmar respondents selected the United States, a fall from 92 percent in 2022. On this and all other Myanmar responses to the ISEAS survey, the opinions of broadly defined “elites” are likely very different from those of the narrower band of military, government, and business elites running the current junta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about their confidence in China’s ability to “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, about 80 percent of these respondents said they had little to no confidence, a slight decline from the 88.8 percent who responded this way in 2022. In contrast, approximately 30.5 percent of respondents stated that they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to the 11.5 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in terms of political and strategic significance, approximately 49.6 percent of Myanmar respondents believed the United States is the predominant political and strategic power in the region, up from 19.7 percent in 2022. This compares to 40 percent who believed China is the primary power, a precipitous drop from 70.9 percent in 2022. These huge swings seem to reflect a significant shift in the kinds of elites ISEAS surveyed. The Myanmar sample size in 2023 was less than a third of 2022’s, and it had a much larger proportion of businesspeople — 29 percent compared to just 3 percent — and a much smaller proportion of self-identified government officials — 26 percent compared to 45 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, given the scale of China’s economic engagement in Myanmar, 72 percent of respondents to the 2023 ISEAS survey identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, compared to only 14 percent for the United States. By contrast, in the 2022 ISEAS report, 83.4 percent of respondents selected China as the region’s primary economic power, with only 6 percent selecting the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 115 Myanmar individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 350 Myanmar respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-6&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Myanmar and the United States amounted to $799 million in 2021, or less than 3 percent of Myanmar’s trade volume that year. This figure is reflective of the overall collapse of U.S. engagement and the country’s economic tailspin since the coup. But trade flows were not that much larger before the coup — $1.2 billion in 2019 and $1.3 billion in 2020. China’s trade with Myanmar, by contrast, stood at $8.7 billion in 2021, or 29 percent of Myanmar’s total trade that year. This is a marked decline from $12.2 billion in 2019 and $11.9 billion in 2020 but shows that the junta remains reliant on China amid international isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with trade, China was a much larger investor in Myanmar before the coup and remains one today. Over the past 10 years, the United States has accounted for less than 4 percent of foreign direct investment into Myanmar, while China has accounted for more than 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $1.18 billion and committed $1.41 billion in assistance to Myanmar between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $2.23 billion and committed $10.9 billion in assistance to Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;philippines&quot;&gt;Philippines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of all the United States’ Southeast Asian partners, the Philippines has received the most time and attention from Washington under the Biden administration. Political and security cooperation with the United States has grown during the first year of the Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. government, resulting in the recent expansion of the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, as well as more serious thinking in Manila on how to better network with the broader web of U.S. alliances in the region. Major shifts in U.S.-Philippines relations reflect not only longstanding support for the alliance among strategic elites and the public, but also growing anxieties about China and its aggressive behavior in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;public-opinion-7&quot;&gt;Public Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ncWkfWv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public opinion polling conducted by PulseAsia in June 2022 found that 89 percent of respondents evinced either a “great deal” or a “fair amount” of trust in the United States. This represents an upward shift of 5 percentage points from the last time Pulse Asia conducted this survey in September 2019. By contrast, only 33 percent of respondents expressed trust in China, a slight increase from 25 percent in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results are largely consistent with public opinion polling conducted in December 2022 by Social Weather Stations (SWS). The SWS survey found that the Filipino public broadly trusts the United States, which holds a net trust score of +74 percentage points, calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents selecting “little trust” from the percentage selecting “much trust.” These results mirror SWS’s past findings, with the United States not having dipped below +55 net percentage points since the start of the Benigno Aquino III administration in 2010. By contrast, China’s net trust score was -6 percentage points, a slight rise from recent years but still significantly lower than that of other regional partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results in turn echo surveys conducted by Pew on Filipino attitudes toward the United States and China. Pew’s 2019 Global Attitudes Survey, the last to ask Filipinos about their opinions and which surveyed 1,035 Filipinos from May–June 2019, found that 80 percent of Filipino respondents held a favorable opinion of the United States, compared to the 42 percent who held a favorable opinion of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Democracy Perception Index found a similar preference for the United States among Filipino respondents. In that poll, 67 percent of Filipinos held a positive view of the United States and just 5 percent negative, for a net approval of +61 percentage points. In contrast, 31 percent each held positive and negative views of China, for a net approval of 0 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the Eurasia Group Foundation’s 2023 Caught in the Middle: Views of US-China Competition Across Asia report found that, across a survey of 500 Filipino respondents representative of the online population in the Philippines, approximately 81.6 percent of respondents held a positive view of the United States, compared to the 18.4 percent who held a negative view. This stands in stark contrast to the 30.2 percent of Filipino respondents who held a positive view of China and the 69.8 percent of respondents who held a negative view. Approximately 64 percent of respondents who held negative views of China attribute this sentiment to Beijing’s military destabilization of the region. When asked to consider the impact of U.S.-Philippine military cooperation, 85 percent of respondents believed that such cooperation has had a positive impact, compared to 33.5 percent of respondents who believed that China-Philippines military cooperation has had a positive impact. In terms of diplomatic influence — interpreted here as being akin to strategic influence — 49 percent of Filipino respondents believe that the United States holds the most influence, compared to 22 percent of respondents who selected China. While a plurality of Filipino respondents selected ASEAN as the region’s predominant economic power, approximately 24 percent of respondents selected the United States, while roughly 20 percent selected China, assessed here as a “toss-up.” The report also found that, when aggregating the mean score of four soft power variables to form an overall soft power measurement, the United States scored 10.3 out of a 1–16-point scale in the eyes of Filipino respondents, compared to 6.4 for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CvxSrZo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elite polling by ISEAS in the Philippines provides useful data points, but the sample size involved in 2023 is not sufficient to assess Filipino elite opinion with confidence. Comparing its findings to other elite surveys with larger sample sizes, however, allows a confident assessment of the topline question of whether Filipino elites have warmer feelings toward the United States or China. When forced to choose between the two in the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 78.8 percent of Filipino respondents selected the United States, a slight fall from 83.5 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about their confidence in China’s ability to “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, approximately 62.7 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence, a drop from the 82 percent who responded this way in 2022. Meanwhile, among Filipino elites in 2023, only 20.2 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” roughly on par with the 22 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A survey of approximately 1,200 Filipino strategic elites — including policy experts, uniformed personnel, and academics — conducted by Amador Research Services in November and December 2022 provides greater confidence to the finding that Filipino elites prefer the United States to China. Asked with which countries the Philippines should strengthen partnerships, 69 percent of respondents said the United States, compared to just 39 percent for China. This survey represents a much larger number of elites but is more heavily weighted toward academia (44 percent of respondents) and the military (38 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plurality of Filipino respondents to the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 44.4 percent, identified the United States as the primary political and strategic power in the region, down slightly from 51 percent in 2022. Meanwhile, about 30.3 percent of respondents believed China is the predominant strategic power in the region, down from 37 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, a plurality of 36.4 percent of Filipino respondents identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, a significant drop from the 65.8 percent who answered this way in 2022. The size of this swing should be treated with a high degree of skepticism, especially because the number of Filipino respondents to the ISEAS survey plummeted by more than 75 percent in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 99 Filipino individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 400 Filipino respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-7&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between the Philippines and the United States amounted to $20.1 billion in 2021, or 10 percent of the Philippines’ trade volume. This represents a return to pre–Covid-19 levels, which stood at $20.1 billion in 2019 before dipping to $17.4 billion in 2020. But China’s trade with the Philippines is nearly double that of the United States. It reached $39.7 billion, or about 20 percent of the Philippines’ total trade, in 2021. This surpasses the $36.6 billion in bilateral trade in 2019, after which there was a sharp drop to $31.8 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is more competitive with China on foreign direct investment in the Philippines than in most of the rest of the region, though it still lags. The United States provided 15 percent of the Philippines’ inbound foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, compared to 22 percent provided by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $1.40 billion and committed $1.27 billion in assistance to the Philippines between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent only $262 million in assistance to the Philippines, a figure that pales against the $6.28 billion it committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;singapore&quot;&gt;Singapore&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a formal treaty ally, Singapore is of critical importance to U.S. interests in the region. The city-state’s longstanding defense partnership with Washington is vital to U.S. forward presence, providing access, basing, and overflight privileges. Singapore has also played a leading role in shaping the region’s economic architecture, exemplified by its participation in the CPTPP and IPEF, in addition to its efforts to forge a web of digital economy agreements with partners worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;public-opinion-8&quot;&gt;Public Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rm9WE0t.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While views toward China have slumped in much of the world, nationally representative surveys conducted by Pew demonstrate that the Singaporean public favors China over the United States. Approximately 67 percent of Singaporean respondents in 2022 held favorable views toward China, compared to 51 percent who held favorable views toward the United States. These findings are largely consistent with Pew’s data from 2021, in which approximately 64 percent of respondents held favorable views toward China and 51 percent held favorable views toward the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 Pew Global Attitudes Survey also asked Singaporean respondents with which country it is most important for the city-state to have close economic relations. Respondents chose China more often than the United States (49 and 33 percent, respectively). Given the context, it is reasonable to treat this as analogous to asking which country Singaporeans see as the leading economic power now and in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2023 Democracy Perception Index, Singaporean respondents were more evenly split, but still favored China slightly. This survey found that 44 percent of Singaporeans held a positive view of the United States and 24 percent a negative view, for a net approval of +20 percentage points. A slightly higher 49 percent held a positive view of China and 20 percent held a negative one, for a net approval of +29 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the Eurasia Group Foundation’s 2023 Caught in the Middle: Views of US-China Competition Across Asia report found that, across a nationally representative survey of 500 Singaporean respondents, approximately 47.8 percent of respondents held a positive view of the United States, compared to 52.2 percent who held a negative view. This falls short of the 55.7 percent of Singaporean respondents who held a positive view of China and the 44.3 percent of respondents who held a negative view. When asked to consider the impact of U.S.-Singapore military cooperation, 81.7 percent of respondents believed that such cooperation has had a positive impact, compared to 71.9 percent of respondents who believed that China-Singapore military cooperation has had a positive impact. In terms of diplomatic influence — interpreted here as being akin to strategic influence — 42 percent of Singaporean respondents believe that the United States holds the most influence, compared to 38 percent of respondents who selected China. Moreover, some 52 percent of Singaporean respondents also hold the view that China is the most influential economic power in Asia. The report also found that, when aggregating the mean score of four soft power variables to form an overall soft power measurement, the United States scored 7.7 out of a 1–16-point scale in the eyes of Singaporean respondents, compared to 7.9 for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gpfMAmz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singaporean elite opinion as reflected by the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey is markedly different than that of the public. Considering that ISEAS is a Singapore-based institute, its elite network in the city-state is probably its most robust, and the answers for Singapore therefore the most representative of any country in its dataset. About 61 percent of Singaporean respondents favored the United States if forced to choose between the two major powers, though this is down from 77.9 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, 56.3 percent said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, compared to the 69.8 percent who responded this way in 2022. In contrast, only 38.5 percent of respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 31.1 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of political and strategic importance, 33.2 percent of Singaporean respondents viewed China as the region’s primary political and strategic power, down from 48.2 percent in 2022. Approximately 48.1 percent of Singaporean respondents selected the United States as the region’s primary political and strategic power, up slightly from 46.8 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like their neighbors, most Singaporean elites view China as the primary economic power in Asia, with 70.7 percent of respondents to the State of Southeast Asia saying as much in 2023, down from 81.1 percent in 2022. This is in stark contrast to the mere 13.5 percent who selected the United States as the primary economic power in Asia, up slightly from 12.2 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 208 Singaporean individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 222 Singaporean respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-8&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States remains more competitive when it comes to trade with Singapore than it is in most of the region, but the gap is widening. U.S.-Singapore trade amounted to $79.8 billion in 2021, or 9 percent of the city-state’s total trade volume that year. That was largely unchanged from $78.3 billion in 2019 and $75.4 billion in 2020. Meanwhile, China’s trade with Singapore stood at $122.3 billion in 2021, or approximately 14 percent of the city-state’s total. That was up substantially from $100.7 billion in 2019 and $98.7 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the United States maintains a sizeable advantage when it comes to investment in Singapore, providing 27 percent of the country’s inbound foreign direct investment over the past 10 years. China provided just 11 percent during this timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore does not currently receive ODA from the United States as categorized by the OECD, nor does it seem to receive anything that might be considered aid from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thailand&quot;&gt;Thailand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Thailand is one of the United States’ five Indo-Pacific allies, the U.S.-Thailand relationship has stagnated in recent years, partially due to ongoing political instability following Thailand’s 2014 coup. Although cooperation at the operational level remains robust, Thailand receives less attention from the Biden administration than non-allies such as Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yfUGr4K.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only recent public opinion polling of Thai views on the United States and China appears to be the Democracy Perception Index, which can only be treated with medium rather than high confidence for reasons explored in the methodology section. The 2023 survey found that 49 percent of Thai respondents held a positive view of the United States and just 9 percent held a negative one, for a net approval of +40 percentage points. By comparison, 49 percent held a positive view of China versus 18 percent negative, for a net approval of +22 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YDeb6J4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISEAS surveys of Thai elites provide useful data points, but the sample sizes involved are not sufficient to assess Thai elite opinion with confidence. A narrow majority of Thai respondents to the 2023 State of Southeast Asia poll, approximately 57 percent, picked the United States in a hypothetical scenario in which the region were forced to choose sides between the two powers, which is unchanged from 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked whether China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, 56.9 percent of Thai respondents said they had little to no confidence, up from 47.9 percent in 2022. In contrast, 34.7 percent of respondents in 2023 had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 26.5 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, 45.8 percent of Thai respondents identified China as the region’s predominant political and strategic power, down from 55.6 percent in 2022. Meanwhile, only 36.1 percent selected the United States as the region’s predominant political and strategic power, though this is up from 27.4 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 74 percent of Thai respondents to the 2023 State of Southeast Asia poll identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, a slight rise from 69.2 percent in 2022. Meanwhile, only 9 percent of respondents selected the United States as the predominant economic power in the region, a slight fall from 13.7 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 114 Thai elites responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 91 Thai respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-9&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Thailand and the United States amounted to $55.8 billion in 2021, or 10 percent of Thailand’s trade volume that year. This was up from $45.8 billion in 2019 and $49.5 billion in 2020. China’s goods trade with Thailand was nearly twice as large, at $103 billion in 2021, or approximately 19 percent of Thailand’s total trade and nearly a quarter of its imports. This was up substantially from $73.9 billion in 2019 and $79.6 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States remains the larger investor in Thailand by a narrow margin. It provided over 13 percent of Thailand’s inbound foreign direct investment in the past decade, during which China accounted for approximately 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $374 million and committed $473 million in assistance to Thailand between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $2.27 billion and committed $21.6 billion in assistance to Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vietnam&quot;&gt;Vietnam&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam has been a focal point of U.S. diplomatic engagement during the Biden administration. Its status as a claimant in the South China Sea disputes and the harassment the country regularly faces at the hands of the China Coast Guard and its maritime militia have led Hanoi to take incremental steps to boost security cooperation with the United States. And Vietnam’s emergence as a hub for high-end manufacturing makes it an attractive destination for companies seeking to diversify away from reliance on China, meaning Hanoi will inevitably play a key role in the region’s increasingly complex economic architecture, including the Biden administration’s IPEF. While Vietnam maintains strong ties with China, particularly at the party level, historic animosity and current tensions limit the level of influence Beijing has over Hanoi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only recent public opinion polling of Vietnamese views on the United States and China appears to be the Democracy Perception Index, which can only be treated with medium rather than high confidence. The 2023 survey found that 70 percent of Vietnamese respondents held a positive view of the United States and just 5 percent held a negative one, for a net approval of +65 percentage points. Meanwhile, 35 percent held a positive view of China, compared to 25 percent negative, for a net approval of +12 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This echoes the older but more rigorous findings of the spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey, in which Pew found that about 80 percent of Vietnamese respondents identified China’s power and influence as a major threat to global peace and security, while only 21 percent said the same of the United States. This far surpassed the second most identified threat, climate change, which was selected by 61 percent of Vietnamese respondents. Vietnam was the only country polled in which China was identified as the top global threat, suggesting a unique and deep-seated antipathy. But without more recent polling, the Vietnamese public’s preference for the United States over China can only be assessed with medium confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISEAS surveys of Vietnamese elites provide useful data points, but the sample sizes involved are not sufficient to assess Vietnamese elite opinion with confidence. When forced to choose between the two major powers in the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 77.9 percent of Vietnamese respondents selected the United States, an increase from 73.6 in 2022. This was second only to respondents from the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked whether China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, 78.7 percent of Vietnamese respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence, up from the 64.6 percent in 2022. In contrast, only 19.8 percent of Vietnamese respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 12.5 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, 55.2 percent of Vietnamese respondents identified China as the region’s predominant political and strategic power, up slightly from 52.8 percent in 2022. Only 27.2 percent of respondents in 2023 selected the United States as the region’s predominant political and strategic power, down from 32.6 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, 69 percent of Vietnamese respondents in 2023 identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, down slightly from 71.5 percent in 2022. Only 9.6 percent of respondents selected the United States as the predominant economic power in the region, a slight fall from 16.7 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 136 Vietnamese individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 112 Vietnamese respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-10&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Vietnam and the United States amounted to $111.5 billion in 2021, or approximately 17 percent of Vietnam’s trade volume that year. These trade flows are growing rapidly, up from $75.8 billion in 2019 and $90.8 billion in 2020. But they are also imbalanced, consisting of $96.3 billion of goods flowing from Vietnam to the United States, or 29 percent of Vietnam’s total exports, and $15.2 billion flowing the other direction, less than 5 percent of Vietnam’s imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s trade with Vietnam stood at $165.8 billion in 2021, or approximately 25 percent of the country’s total trade that year. It is not outpacing the United States in Vietnam as badly as it does in most of the region, but this trade is also growing rapidly, up from $117 billion in 2019 and $133 billion in 2020. And it is imbalanced in the other direction, with $55.9 billion in Vietnamese exports to China in 2021, accounting for 17 percent of Vietnam’s total export volume, and $109.9 billion in Chinese imports, or 33 percent of Vietnam’s total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two great powers are on par with each other when it comes to investment in Vietnam. Over the past decade, the United States was the source of approximately 7 percent of Vietnam’s inbound foreign direct investment, while China accounted for approximately 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $896 million and committed $1.10 billion in assistance to Vietnam between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $2.37 billion and committed $7.29 billion in assistance to Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia resides at the forefront of U.S.-China competition. The region has significant leverage to shape those relations, but country-by-country variance in Southeast Asian perspectives toward the United States and China helps explain why regional institutions such as ASEAN struggle to navigate great power rivalry. This variance also carries important implications for whether Washington and Beijing can successfully carry out their agendas. The one who is more responsive to intra-regional differences is likely to find more success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The available polling indicates that the United States enjoys more soft power and popularity than China across most of the region. Even with major gaps in public polling, majorities in the most populous states — Indonesia, and especially the Philippines and Vietnam — prefer the United States to China. Whether that is still true of most elites in Southeast Asia is unclear. In any case, the overall preference for the United States among regional publics is a significant advantage for Washington as it endeavors to coax governments into aligning with it on a range of issues, or at least keep regional states from aligning with China on issues that would damage U.S. interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soft power and popularity matter, but so do perceptions of hard power and the ability to deliver concrete benefits. Elites and publics in every country for which there is sufficient data, except the Philippines, see China as the predominant economic power in Asia. Most of their counterparts in places where the data is lacking probably do too. And the reality is that on most metrics, China is widening the economic influence gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Indonesian and Philippine publics still views the United States as the leading strategic power in the region, but who knows whether their counterparts in the rest of Southeast Asia agree. The same is true of most elites. Other than in Singapore, it is unclear whether elites among the United States’ most important Southeast Asian allies and partners — Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam — still see it as the predominant strategic power in Asia. This would accurately reflect the United States’ still considerable military advantages, as detailed for instance by the Lowy Institute’s Asia Power Index. But perceptions do not always match reality; more polling is needed on this front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington needs to be more attuned to how individual countries perceive their relations with the United States and China and shape its levers of engagement accordingly. Growing concern regarding China’s behavior and intentions create diplomatic and economic openings across the region, and Washington should advance a positive political, security, and economic agenda to meet the moment. One component should be an expansion of public and elite opinion polling in Southeast Asia so the United States can better understand how it is being perceived, target initiatives where they can have the greatest impact, and judge year-over-year progress.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成稱發起「墨落無悔」為展抗爭意志 聲明無約束力亦非協調會議共識&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成稱不信「35+」、惟有「政棍」明知不可能仍「販賣假希望」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZBBPqXG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）踏入審訊第100天。鄒家成今就「墨落無悔」聲明作供，表示戴耀廷2020年6月9日記者會宣布參選人毋須簽文件以免製造「DQ紅書」，是他和張可森、梁晃維發起「墨落無悔」的「導火線」，他質疑戴做法「有冇咁兒戲」、是「退縮」表現，望透過聲明展現抗爭意志、防範初選落敗者繼續參選，而參選人是自願簽署，自行承擔DQ風險。鄒又指，「墨落」並無約束力，如簽署者反悔發起人「咩都做唔到」，但聲明面向公眾，故如違承諾「要接受問責嘅對象都係選民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，「墨落聲明」的結構是由他制定，再由張可森草擬，當中談及會運用否決權的字句是來自戴耀廷在新東協調會議上的說法。惟鄒強調，該點雖會上有討論，但無達成共識、亦非初選協調會議共識，而參選人簽署「墨落」後，是就「墨落」所寫聲明形成表面共識，但無提倡無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱戴耀廷宣布參選人毋須簽文件-為他與張可森梁晃維發起墨落無悔導火線&quot;&gt;鄒稱戴耀廷宣布參選人毋須簽文件 為他與張可森梁晃維發起「墨落無悔」導火線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選新界東的鄒家成今繼續作供，步入法庭後向旁聽席微笑揮手。鄒在大律師陳世傑主問下表示，無收過「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」的文件。法官李運騰關注文件提及「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，問新東是否有協議使用「會運用」，鄒不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就「墨落無悔」發問，鄒家成表示，理解戴耀廷6月9日記者會表示毋須參選人簽文件，因不想製造一個「DQ紅書」予藉口行政機關DQ候選人，而「我認為6月9號個記招，係一條導火線，令到我同埋另外兩位，即係張可森同埋梁晃維，發起『墨落無悔』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒質疑戴耀廷決定有冇咁兒戲係一個退縮&quot;&gt;鄒質疑戴耀廷決定「有冇咁兒戲」、「係一個退縮」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，他約於6月10日中午才從網媒得知戴耀廷曾於6月9日召記者會，當時他有兩個想法，首先戴在協調會上一直表示，能達成共識的項目「會變成一份文件畀參選人簽署」，亦是他接收到的訊息，但戴在無通知過參選人的情況下，突然開記招指不需要簽署文件，「我就覺得：有冇咁兒戲呀？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，其次是戴耀廷稱不想製造「DQ紅書」，但鄒認為據2016年選舉經驗，DQ紅線應是「主張香港獨立」，但協調會上無討論與港獨有關，「所以我唔明驚啲乜嘢」。鄒並指，「如果係因為一啲消息人士去施壓又好、定唔知點樣啦，而選擇突然宣布唔需要簽署文件呢，係一個退縮。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱先後聯絡張可森梁晃維-表示要簽返啲嘢去展現抗爭意志&quot;&gt;鄒稱先後聯絡張可森梁晃維 表示「要簽返啲嘢去展現抗爭意志」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續指當時約為下午3時，「我記得我係先同張可森聯絡」，分享上述想法，張有看記招亦同意其想法，鄒續指「要簽返啲嘢去展現抗爭意志」，張同意；鄒其後再聯絡梁晃維說相同的話，梁也同意，三人遂開設一個 Telegram 群組討論。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 左起：張可森、鄒家成、梁晃維（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注，為何鄒家成會聯絡參選新界西的張可森，鄒指他大概4月時已認識張可森和參選港島的梁晃維，「我哋見過面、傾過偈，覺得幾啱傾」；至於為何要找其他區的參選人，「其實冇諗咁多嘅嗰一刻」。鄒並同意法官陳仲衡指，他是為整個初選、而非只是其選區做一些事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱聲明自願簽署無約束力-如違承諾接受問責對象是選民&quot;&gt;鄒稱聲明自願簽署無約束力 如違承諾接受問責對象是選民&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，三人很快決定要發起一個網絡聲明，主要有三個目的：一，向公眾展現抗爭意志；二，防範其他人初選落敗都繼續參加官方選舉；三，「呢份聲明係比大家自願去簽嘅，咁就由得其他參選人自行去承擔返可能會被DQ嘅風險」，這亦是回應戴耀廷6月9日記招的擔憂。陳世傑問，該聲明是一份聲明抑或協議？鄒答「佢只係一個聲明」，如人們同意就可選擇簽署，他一度指「情況類似民建聯喺街頭搞一個簽名活動咁樣」，惟法官指不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，「墨落無悔」是一份「無約束力」的聲明，「事實上佢簽完『墨落無悔』，佢最後係反悔嘅話，其實我哋三位發起人，咩都做唔到。」法官陳仲衡指，但聲明提到「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」，鄒同意，指「墨落」是一份「面向公眾」的聲明，「如果參選人違反承諾，佢要接受問責嘅對象都係選民。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱三人討論約一小時後-由張可森執筆起草&quot;&gt;鄒稱三人討論約一小時後 由張可森執筆起草&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落無悔」的草擬過程，鄒家成解釋「負責執筆起草嗰個，係張可森」，而張正式草擬前三人曾討論了約一小時，張約於4時開始「閉門草擬」，草擬途中遇到問題也會再問，最終他們6時半左右收到初稿，三人修改一次後，接近8時完成最終版本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，3人一早決定晚上9時發文，並於8至9時期間嘗試分別私下將「墨落」的最終版本發給他們認識的參選人。鄒解釋，此做法一來「純粹禮貌上，早少少通知我哋認識嘅參選人」，二來亦因「正式出街嗰一刻，我哋都想多返少少人名喺呢度，唔係淨係得我哋三個」，而他們只是通知而非諮詢他們意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱發布墨落前曾各自通知非同區參選人&quot;&gt;鄒稱發布「墨落」前曾各自通知非同區參選人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，他只曾將聲明發給黃子悅，解釋「只係因為我電話有佢 number 啫，冇咩特別」，他並不知道張和梁分別私下發給誰。鄒並指當時向黃指聲明於9時會「正式出街」，問黃有否興趣簽署，黃說「好」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注，為何參選新東的鄒，會聯絡參選新西的黃子悅，問鄒沒有其他新東候選人的聯絡電話嗎？鄒指，三人事前已表示不想將聲明私下發給同區參選人，「因為始終覺得好似係同區嘅競爭者，咁就唔想好似私底下 send 畀你好似教你點樣選舉咁樣」，形容是「刻意安排」。鄒並指就其他新東參選人，「如果我話係咪要搵佢哋搵唔到呢，唔係」，但當時無特意將新東參選人加入電話簿。鄒並在法官追問下指，三人就聯絡其他人沒有分工，「只係避免 send 畀自己同區。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒重申，不記得張可森和梁晃維聯絡了什麼人，而他們各自聯絡參選人後將收集到的名字整合，並於9時一起在 Facebook 發布，但聲明發布時有多少名字他「真係唔記得」，不過連同三人在內「應該係10個內」。鄒亦指沒有指示過其他人要在自己 Facebook 發布，供他們自行考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒供述簽署流程-包括在google-doc加名及聯絡發起人&quot;&gt;鄒供述簽署流程 包括在Google Doc加名及聯絡發起人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落無悔」加名的方法，鄒家成解釋，當時「反應都叫做幾踴躍，啲名都好亂」，故他於6月10日晚或11日早上曾開設一個所有人都可以編輯的「Google doc」檔案，讓自己整理名單，而張可森和梁晃維有向其他人私下發布該文件的連結，他亦會「隨緣」在 Facebook 看有沒有人發布聲明，並更新「Google Doc」的名單，間中就會按名單編輯 Facebook 的帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，為何聲明最底有「*如希望參與聯署，請聯絡鄒家成/張可森/梁晃維」一句，鄒答：「咁搞得一個公開嘅聲明，都叫做打開門做生意，咁就梗係想越多人簽越好啦，因為個目的係要展現抗爭意志啊嘛。」鄒同意，除上述兩方法，亦可透過聯絡發起人簽署，當時亦有人私下 Facebook inbox 他表示想加名，但並非參加初選的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落是以五區為基礎的聲明-曾獲張可森和梁晃維提供九西九東資訊&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落」是以五區為基礎的聲明 曾獲張可森和梁晃維提供九西九東資訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就「墨落無悔」的內容，鄒家成表明「『墨落無悔』個結構，係我制定嘅」，即包括第一至四段和兩點聲明，但不包括第五段。鄒其後就聲明內容解釋，就「我們認為，在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎」，鄒稱是指五個地區的初選協調會議，「『墨落無悔』係一份以五區作為基礎嘅聲明。」至於「共同綱領」，鄒指是五區協調會議上的「議程（agenda）」，即協調會議上「所有傾過嘅項目」，但不一定有取得共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注，聲明發起人只來自3個選區，他們如何得知其他區都有討論同樣的綱領？鄒指三人有各自分享自己區協調會議的情況，而九西的資訊由張可森提供，但不知道他聯絡誰，而張可森或梁晃維亦有告知他九東的資訊，但他不記得是誰說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱協調會議共識包括辦初選等4點-惟亦有未達共識項目存差異&quot;&gt;鄒稱協調會議共識包括辦初選等4點 惟亦有未達共識項目、存「差異」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問協調會議達成什麼共識，鄒指有4點：辦初選、辦初選論壇、以靈童制為替補機制、及「贏咗有得選、輸咗冇得選」。法官陳慶偉問，最後一點即與「墨落」的第二點聲明「我認同若支持度跌出各區預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」一樣？鄒指「唔完全一樣」，指前者是「棄選機制」其中一個分支，另一分支是目標議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就聲明「考慮到立場差異，此一綱領已達致抗爭陣營光譜的最大公因數」一句提到的「差異」，鄒解釋「喺初選協調會議上面，大家係有啲爭拗嘅」，可理解為在討論「墨落無悔」一刻「暫時未有共識嘅項目」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱兩點聲明為焦點所在引張可森稱畫龍點睛處在向選民交代&quot;&gt;鄒稱兩點聲明為「焦點所在」、引張可森稱「畫龍點睛」處在向選民交代&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」一句，鄒解釋是一個「過渡句」，「根據張可森嘅講法，佢係話想產生一種承上啟下，同埋畫龍點睛嘅作用」，林卓廷、陳志全和施德來等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，是否即想令讀者注意到該句之後出現的兩點聲明為重點？鄒同意，亦同意因此聲明標題為「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭」。鄒並指，該兩點「當然係聲明嘅焦點所在」、「當然係聲明嘅重點」，而據張可森的說法，「嗰個畫龍點睛嘅精要之處，在於向選民交代。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落會運用否決權一句非協調會議共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落」會運用否決權一句非協調會議共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，若協調會議的共識只是鄒家成所說的4點，究竟有什麼爭議（controversial）令戴耀廷不想人簽署有該些共識的文件？並笑指戴也宣布了會有初選、之後也會有論壇直播、「贏咗有得選」亦是協調根本概念，該4點有什麼如此秘密（secretive）或具爭議性，令戴不想簽文件？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成回應，看到6月9日記招後「的確係有少少詫異嘅」，他亦不清楚各區達成了什麼共識。但就「墨落」第一點聲明：「我認同『五大訴求，缺一不可』。我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求，撤銷所有抗爭者控罪，令相關人士為警暴問責，並重啟政改達致雙普選」，他指並非共識，舉例戴在新東會議只表達他個人對五大訴求的看法，但並非大家「真係 round 一圈」去討論的議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱戴耀廷新東會上重複否決權句子-自己憑記憶寫予張可森草擬墨落&quot;&gt;鄒稱戴耀廷新東會上重複否決權句子 自己憑記憶寫予張可森草擬「墨落」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，就「我認同『五大訴求，缺一不可』。我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」這一部分字眼，「係我喺 Telegram 打（字）畀張可森嘅」；至於之後「撤銷所有抗爭者控罪，令相關人士為警暴問責，並重啟政改達致雙普選」的部分，他則不知道，應是張自己寫，但他們曾討論五大訴求的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續展示新界西的協議文件，指會運用否決權一句與「墨落」幾乎一樣。鄒同意兩者有相似之處，並解釋戴耀廷有在第二次協調會議讀出該句。法官關注李運騰是從文件讀出、抑或是憑記憶讀出，惟鄒沒有正面回應，並指不記得當時有否抄低整句句子，但該句在協調會議有重複數次，他是「憑記憶打返出嚟畀張可森去寫呢句嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官主動展示新東及新西協議文件-稱與墨落字句一致問是否巧合&quot;&gt;官主動展示新東及新西協議文件 稱與「墨落」字句一致、問是否巧合&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰笑着問，會上重複的次數足以令他記清楚該句？鄒說「其實呢句好好記㗎」，後答「係」。李亦問，因此該段其實是受戴耀廷影響，即鄒是跟隨戴的說法？鄒指戴耀廷讀出該句時有提到「積極」，但他就根據新東爭拗改為「會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再要求展示新東協議文件，用字為「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，問「墨落」出現相似句子，是否只是巧合？鄒重申「墨落」用「會運用」是他在第二次新東協調會議的動議，因此「未必稱得上為巧合，而係嚟自我嘅經驗」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落聲明起源並非共識簽署後是就墨落聲明形成共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落」聲明起源並非共識、簽署後是就「墨落」聲明形成共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，因此鄒家成是將一些並無達成共識的內容放進聲明？鄒說「我的確係想推銷聲明裡面第一點」，重申目的是聲明所列「為確保抗爭陣營參選人，有最基本的抗爭意志」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指但那會減低彈性，因戴耀廷曾稱加入「積極」是為保留彈性。鄒指戴無特別提「係唔係想保持彈性」，只提到意思是「可以否決、可以唔否決」。李指那正是彈性，鄒即說：「可以否決可以唔否決嘅話，咁我唔知寫嚟做乜嘢。」李運騰笑指他同意，並指因此鄒是想展示抗爭意志，望用最清楚的寫法，避免模棱兩可？鄒同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒再同意，就運用否決權的第一點聲明會上有討論，但沒有達成共識，強調「墨落無悔」聲明起源並非來自共識，「當有人同意兩點聲明，佢簽署之後，我哋就會形成一個表面上嘅共識，就係有某一個數量嘅人同意呢兩點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒不同意墨落無悔向組織者施壓重申無提倡無差別否決財案&quot;&gt;鄒不同意「墨落無悔」向組織者施壓、重申無提倡無差別否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問，而鄒是想將聲明通知組織者？李運騰亦問，鄒是想透過聲明的簽署人數，向組織者施壓？鄒不同意，並同意李運騰指聲明是面向公眾，無意向組織者施壓。不過鄒亦同意，之後曾將聲明及簽署人數發給組織者，陳問是想讓組織者知道情況？鄒說「呢個係之後嘅事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就鄒早前供稱，會以五大訴求為「唯一優先標準」審視預算案，他今同意認為議員的責任是爭取五大訴求，而以五大訴求為審視預算案的基礎，亦是恰當履行議員職責。鄒亦指，他在「墨落」並無提倡無差別否決預算案，亦對簽署者沒有任何約束性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）踏入審訊第100天。鄒家成繼續作供，表示與發起「墨落無悔」聲明的張可森和梁晃維均不相信「35+」，而初選意義是選出最多具抗爭意志代議士，「墨落」與「35+」無關，只是將參選人政治理念帶到選民面前，展示抗爭意志。鄒又提及，有三類人表面主張35+有可能，包括明知35+不可能但仍「販賣假希望」的「政棍」、覺得35+有可能的天真理想主義者、及覺得35+無可能，但有政治勇氣和承擔望讓全世界知道，無論如何努力「當權者係唔會畀民主派攞到35+」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又表示，曾聽聞不少傳統泛民要求戴耀廷勿要大家簽文件，認為戴稱毋須簽文件是來自傳統泛民意思；而他直至收到審訊文件夾前無聽過「攬炒十步」，並理解「攬炒」為「側重於自我犧牲」的態度，從不是禁忌，反而很常見，「有權勢者打壓無權勢者，有反抗，就會形成『攬炒』」，而攬炒目的是拉近雙方政治勢力，為和談帶來可能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落並無以35作為前提遵守棄選機制不代表能取35&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落」並無以「35+」作為前提、遵守棄選機制不代表能取「35+」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續就「墨落無悔」聲明作供，他今早供稱發起聲明為展示抗爭意志，惟並無約束力。鄒下午被問及聲明與「35+」的關係，他同意「35+計劃」目的是取得立會過半，但「墨落無悔」並沒有以「35+」作為前提。法官陳仲衡指，但就聲明支持度不足須停止選舉工程的一點，與「35+計劃」很有關。鄒不同意有很大關係，指棄選機制概念的確來自「35+計劃」，但參選人遵守不代表會取得「35+」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒重申，「墨落」的主要目的是「為確保抗爭陣營參選人，有最基本的抗爭意志」，法官李運騰即質疑，棄選機制與「抗爭意志」無關。鄒承認兩者的確無直接關係，放在聲明是因認為這是初選的「基本邏輯」，以保障出線者勝出的機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱發起人俱不信35選出最多具抗爭意志代議士方為初選意義&quot;&gt;鄒稱發起人俱不信「35+」、選出最多具抗爭意志代議士方為初選意義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，留意到鄒將「35+計劃」和「初選」進行區分，鄒同意，並同意初選是「35+計劃」的一部分，而35+計劃「只係一個名嚟㗎啫」，「35+」代表議席的目標、亦是組織者想達到的目標，但這不是他的目標，並強調「個議席目標點樣決定，唔會影響到初選個意義」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師陳世傑續問，那初選是否用來達到「35+」的手段？鄒指「個人認為唔係」，指「選出最多具備抗爭意志嘅代議士，先係（初選）最大嘅意義」，同意其看法與組織者不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱聲明將參選人政治理念帶到選民前競爭惟不知其他簽署者動機&quot;&gt;鄒稱聲明將參選人政治理念帶到選民前競爭、惟不知其他簽署者動機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問及，因此無論「35+」或「35-」，對鄒家成來說也是沒有分別，他仍然會繼續發起「墨落無悔」？鄒回應，「基本上我哋三位發起人，都唔相信35+」，而正因他們對未來議會想像都是「35-」，在此前提下，他們認為選出最多具備抗爭意志的代議士才是比較「合情合理」和「實際可行」，並覺得要用一些方法向選民展現抗爭意志，「將參選人嘅政治理念，帶去選民面前競爭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰笑言，而結果是差不多所有人都有簽署聲明。鄒續指，「墨落」是初選競選時其中一個有爭拗的議題，「其他簽署人簽嘅動機係咩，我的確唔知」，「我哋三個做嘅嘢就係提供一個聲明畀大家去簽署，佢哋點樣用呢個聲明，我哋亦都唔知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱表面對35積極有三類人-包括明知不可能仍販賣假希望&quot;&gt;鄒稱表面對35+積極有三類人 包括明知不可能仍「販賣假希望」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成其後在法官追問下重申，以他對張可森和梁晃維的認識，他們3人均不相信「35+」。李運騰笑言，似乎有很多參與者均不相信35+，那鄒協調會上聽過人向戴耀廷稱35+是不可能、或說戴天真嗎？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒說沒有，並主動表示認為對35+採取「比較積極」態度的人，主要分為三類，第一類是「明知35+冇可能，但佢不停去講35+，然之後講35+之後，好似民主會立即降臨咁樣」，鄒並指曾於傳單和街站形容該些人「販賣假希望」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而第二類人「可能真係覺得35+有可能嘅，帶住一絲嘅希望睇吓可唔可以搵到一個攞到35+嘅機會」，鄒認為他們「類似一種帶一點天真嘅理想主義者」，但當時沒有直接這樣說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第三類人，鄒指是「有一啲嘅政治嘅勇氣或者政治嘅承擔」，認為他們「覺得35+係冇可能，但佢哋都會盡力去完成呢個任務，目的其實係想話畀全世界知道，無論我哋點樣努力都好，當權者都係唔會比我哋攞到35+」，亦即「撕破假象嘅表面」。鄒並指他是因應第一類人而有自己的主張。李運騰問，所以他將自己視為第三類人？鄒說：「我係第四類人」，即引來哄堂大笑，惟鄒欲再解釋時被法官打斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官追問時着鄒想清楚-鄒自言諗得好清楚並稱墨落與35無關&quot;&gt;官追問時着鄒想清楚 鄒自言「諗得好清楚」、並稱「墨落」與「35+」無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉要求鄒再想清楚共有多少類人，鄒笑言「其實數唔晒嘅」，因每個小區也可產生一類人，並指頭三類「表面上都會主張35+係有可能」，惟陳慶偉指不是，指頭一類人是認為35+不可能但「販賣假希望」，而「假希望」即是不真實的。鄒苦笑說：「我知、我知……我明呀，我啱啱所講嗰三類人……」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉打斷說：「聽着，想清楚」，鄒說：「我諗得好清楚㗎喇。」陳再說：「因為我不想你現在捏造（make up）證據」，鄒反問：「咁我而家，要點？」旁聽席傳來笑聲，陳遂要求鄒給出最後答案。大律師陳世傑一度問鄒有關第四類人，鄒微笑說「搞掂頭三類先啦」，重申表面上會看到他們主張35+，李運騰問即告訴人35+是可能？鄒說「exactly!」，並指上述純粹是他對他們內在想法的分析。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後說，鄒是指第一大組可分成三個小組，而他們都是相信35+是可能？鄒兩度重申只是「表面上」。陳追問，即他們是否相信35+是可能？鄒說：「不如我哋掉走個大組啦。」陳說：「聽着，我沒有建立大組，是你建立」，又指「我不想你亂說話和一時衝動（“… say something randomly and at the spur of the moment”）」，並嚴厲說「我再給你多一次機會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒其後再次重複對3類人的看法，並形容首類人「係政棍嚟嘅呢類，我形容呢一類係政棍、販賣假希望嘅政棍」，至於第3類人，鄒重申雖然他們明知35+不可能，但目的是想讓香港人或世界知道，「無論我哋點努力都好，當權者係唔會畀民主派攞到35+。」鄒最後指，「墨落無悔」與35+沒有關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒認為戴耀廷記者會稱毋須簽文件-是來自傳統泛民主派意思&quot;&gt;鄒認為戴耀廷記者會稱毋須簽文件 是來自傳統泛民主派意思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後就約於6月17日後進行、由媒體「Spark」對「墨落無悔」3名發起人的訪問發問。被問到是哪家媒體，鄒指有些模糊，記得是由「張可森搵返嚟」、應是某大學的媒體，張向他和梁晃維稱記者想找他們「講一講『墨落無悔』」，和順便介紹自己和講述政治理念，而訪問中「我哋自說自話，事前冇夾過嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示謄本，鄒家成在訪問被問為何發起「墨落無悔」聲明時，提及開會時一直指有共同綱領要大家簽署，但在無通知他們情況下就召開記招指不需要簽：「我哋第一個感覺就話我哋要簽返啲嘢喎，唔可以畀泛民主派單方面去撕毀約章……撕毀緊成個香港民族對於未來嘅想像。」鄒解釋是指戴耀廷稱會讓大家簽文件，其後又突然稱「唔畀簽」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡關注，鄒提及不可讓「泛民」單方面撕毀約章，是不視自己為「泛民」一部分？鄒指此處「泛民」是指「傳統泛民主派」，並指6月9日戴耀廷開記者會前，曾聽聞不少傳統泛民主派約見戴耀廷，並要求戴勿要求大家簽文件，故認為戴記者會所說「其實係嚟自傳統泛民主派嘅意思」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱部分傳統泛民包括岑子杰批評墨落是夾人&quot;&gt;鄒稱部分傳統泛民包括岑子杰批評「墨落」是「夾人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續引張可森訪問提及「如果佢哋係可以了解到呢個時代係需要啲咩，係回應到呢個時代要前進嘅方向嘅話，其實你唔會覺我哋係夾你嘅」，被問「夾」是什麼意思，鄒指張當時是回應就「墨落無悔」是「夾緊人」的批評，該些批評來自部分傳統泛民主派，他當時意識到或留意到的是社民連岑子杰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱攬炒為自我犧牲態度目的拉近雙方勢力為和談帶來可能&quot;&gt;鄒稱「攬炒」為自我犧牲態度、目的拉近雙方勢力為和談帶來可能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張可森訪問亦提及「攬炒」，陳世傑問鄒對「攬炒」的理解，鄒指「『攬炒』對我嚟講係一種態度、一種側重於自我犧牲嘅態度」，並認為2020年初選要延續這種「攬炒」精神，有兩種具體表現，第一是他早前提及實踐議會內「寸土必爭」，第二是「不惜自我犧牲都要阻止惡法」，即「盡力喺議會裡面阻止」的態度。鄒並認為，上述兩種實踐均是在2020年立法會有機會被政權針對、DQ、追討薪金，而行政機關要付出的代價就是「受到制衡」和「推動唔到佢哋想推動嘅惡法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，「『攬炒』從來都唔係一個禁忌」，而且很常見，舉例勞工向資方提出一些改善工作環境的條件，如加薪或減低工作時數，並表明如資方不改善工作環境就會罷工，鄒認為罷工本身就是「攬炒」。鄒又指，「有權勢者打壓無權勢者，有反抗，就會形成『攬炒』」，並認為「攬炒」目的，就是「拉近雙方嘅政治勢力，為和談帶來可能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱無看過戴耀廷攬炒十步&quot;&gt;鄒稱無看過戴耀廷「攬炒十步」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問，鄒家成當時留意到戴耀廷提倡「攬炒十步」嗎？鄒說「我冇睇過」，亦不知道戴當時有關「攬炒」的主張。鄒並指，首次聽到「攬炒十步」是在收到審訊文件夾時，陳指是2021年，鄒稱不記得當時是否已收到文件夾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問張可森梁晃維訪問發言是否代表鄒-鄒都可以呀&quot;&gt;官問張可森梁晃維訪問發言是否代表鄒 鄒：都可以呀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後要求播片，被問到為何發起「墨落無悔」，梁晃維提及如初選協議在如此鬆散情況下定下、無確切文件證明大家也同意，實在不能估算初選後各派人會否繼續堅持參與，甚至入議會後是否會履行當初對港人的承諾，而既然戴耀廷不希望令到多人被DQ，「咁就不如我哋作為有意參選人 take up 返嗰個責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張可森則表示，「墨落無悔」四字是他所寫，望港人或從政者意識到「我哋有啲嘢根本上係唔同咗」，現時不再是討論政治、妥協的藝術、或一開始說要「攬炒」但「回一回價」又不「攬炒」，現時討論的是「抗爭」，而抗爭是不妥協的藝術，「當你簽咗呢張嘢應承咗嘅時候，你絕對唔可以反悔。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;片段播畢後法官陳仲衡問，因三人是一起發起「墨落」，張可森和梁晃維談及為何發起「墨落無悔」的部分，也是代表鄒所說？鄒答：「都可以呀。」陳慶偉亦指，留意到鄒在另外兩人說話時不時點頭，鄒說「我有留意到」。陳續問，那鄒是否不同意他們說法？抑或指他們只是在表達自己意見？鄒回應：「唔會唔同意佢哋嘅諗法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱主問大約到一半&quot;&gt;辯方稱主問大約到一半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑最後問到，鄒訪問提及初選論壇「係唯一一個場地去同泛民主派一個交鋒」，問他為何這樣說，鄒稱因以往也沒試過有一個像初選論壇的平台「畀各門各派嘅人去交流」，而論壇可讓大家就不同政治理念交鋒，繼而尋找民主運動出路。陳仲衡指鄒訪問不是提到「交流」、而是「交鋒」，鄒認為「差唔多啫」，指在論壇語境就是「交鋒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示，已完成就「墨落無悔」的盤問，並指現時大約已到主問一半。法官陳慶偉笑言只到一半？李運騰亦關注下一個議題。陳指會問及提名表格、Facebook 帖文、選舉論壇、WhatsApp 群組等，預計星期四或之前完成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明天續審，只於下午開庭。散庭時，鄒向親友說：「好鬼攰、真係好鬼攰。」&lt;/p&gt;

How groups, whether nonstate actors or states party to a conflict, construct norms, which includes expectations of femininity and masculinity, is crucial to understanding violence.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;These constructions impact the roles imagined, the behaviors normalized, and the treatment of different gendered groups. Traditional gendered narratives have often been resurrected by all sides to the Ukraine conflict, with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s appeal to women, mothers, sisters, and fiancées to support their loved ones in battle; the image beamed around the world of a wounded, pregnant Ukrainian woman curled on a stretcher; and comments made by the UK defense secretary that President Putin is suffering from “small man syndrome” providing just some examples.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these narratives are flawed, reductive, and unhelpful for long-term conflict resolution. They also undermine advancements in the field of women, peace, and security. The presentation of men as defender-warriors and women as fragile and requiring protection contends with the reality of Ukrainian women taking up arms, masks the existence of other potentially vulnerable identity groups, and ultimately impedes the adoption of an inclusive approach to the conflict and any postconflict settlement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has proven much more adept at producing unconventional gendered war propaganda, refusing to denigrate Russian troops and emphasizing women’s active participation in the conflict. Yet, the imagery of female “gun-strapped blonde soldiers” still exceptionalizes women’s participation in the war. Meanwhile, there are some concerns that Ukrainian women are not treated as equal to men in terms of military mobilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief analyzes the ways in which gendered narratives have been employed during the war in Ukraine. It reflects on the traditional use of gendered narratives in the field of security and draws on the author’s research on the role of gender in the field of terrorism. It then explores how these narratives have been deployed by parties to the conflict in Ukraine and the implications of this approach. It does not provide a detailed gendered analysis of the Ukraine conflict or a comprehensive linguistic analysis of the various traditional and social media datasets available. Instead, it aims to demonstrate the hypothesis that gendered narratives used in the conflict and security space, including by those working on counterterrorism issues, often promote flawed understandings about the nature and impact of violence, which can have counterproductive policy implications. The recommendations are aimed at policymakers working in the fields of conflict, security, and terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-power-of-gendered-narratives&quot;&gt;THE POWER OF GENDERED NARRATIVES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How leaders use strategic narratives is widely accepted as a soft power in the realm of global politics, conflict, and terrorism.9 Strategic narratives are a means for political actors to construct a shared meaning of international politics and a tool to articulate a position on a specific issue and to shape the perceptions, beliefs, and behavior of domestic and international actors. Their “narrators” are primarily elites (government leaders, security experts, consultants, policy analysts, etc.) who construct and communicate them to the general public through speeches, press conferences, official documents, and more. Narratives have grown in significance in particular due to the introduction of social media, which provides another arena to demonstrate power, critique, and even mockery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politicians routinely employ gendered metaphors in foreign policy legitimation. These rely on often preexisting essentialist understandings of women in national culture and mythos and on stereotypes prevalent in the foreign policy and security realms, which are shaped by and assumed to be the realm of men and male actors. This contributes to a gendered framing in which masculinity is superior to femininity. Military institutions, among others, may present women as victims, “damsels in distress,” in need of protection and as ancillary to conflict due to their physically “inferior” attributes and maternal or peaceful disposition. Countless examples of these narratives can be found, throughout history, more recently deployed by policymakers and terrorist groups alike during the “Global War on Terror.” The international intervention in Afghanistan was accompanied by images such as the liberation of Afghan women from the Taliban, indelibly associating the two ideas in the public imagination. Narratives of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant targeted men as soldiers of war while messages for women focused on their roles as mothers, sisters, and lovers. Similar images and narratives appear in the development field and are visible even in the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These narratives are underpinned by the assumption that physical strength is associated with masculinity, which trumps the alternative, physical weakness, which is associated with femininity or effeminate men. Masculine men are often described as war-fighters possessing traits such as leadership, heroism, physical dominance, and aggression. Similar narratives have also been deployed by violent extremist groups drawing on notions of violent masculinity, including feelings of entitlement and supremacy, and gendered grievances, such as shame and emasculation, in their propaganda to recruit and retain committed members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reductive-or-just-false&quot;&gt;REDUCTIVE OR JUST FALSE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narratives have implications, a fact that is often poorly understood by policymakers. If a strategic narrative is a tool for leaders to shape perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors, it is understandable that it is not always entirely accurate and may even be harmful. As a result, the rhetoric can clash with the local reality. Justifying interventions in Afghanistan on the rationale of the liberation of Muslim women reflected ignorance of critical information about Muslim women, Afghanistan, the Taliban, and the realities of the U.S. invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Russian foreign policy propagated through mass media has presented Ukraine as a neo-Nazi state in need of defeating. The war is therefore presented as a holy crusade in defense of the motherland. In fact, Russian leaders use “motherland” when it is something to be protected, “fatherland” when the situation calls for aggression. Russian narratives intimate Ukraine’s supposedly subordinate role in geopolitical terms by describing Ukraine as a “loose woman in need of saving by its older brother.” Ukrainian male politicians are presented as “sissy boys” and no match for “real men” of pro-Russian politics. President Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov are presented as the masculine ideal, compared to the seemingly deviant male (sissy boys) and female protagonists (damsels in distress), to legitimize the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These narratives have been undermined by unfolding events on the battlefield and challenged by President Zelenskyy’s success at presenting his country as “a progressive, gender-egalitarian, LGBTQ-friendly, 21st-century democratic power.” These narratives also rarely acknowledge that conflict creates a range of lived experiences for different identity groups. Popular Western narratives referring to the horrors facing women and children in every address urging support of the conflict are not the full picture. Some women may indeed be more vulnerable during conflict, particularly those who are from ethnic minorities or poorer communities. Yet, people with disabilities may also lose access to vital infrastructure or public services, while sexual violence toward all people is exacerbated by conflict. LGBTQ+ groups also face risks in this conflict. President Putin has mentioned “gender freedoms” more than once to justify Russia’s war against Ukraine and simultaneously crack down on its own citizens. Over the last decade, gender and LGBTQ+ issues have become central targets of repression in Russia aimed at protecting President Putin’s regime from perceived domestic threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gendered stereotypes depicting women as civilian victims also clash with the reality of Ukrainian women’s active participation in conflicts. Women became eligible for the draft in December 2021, and by 2022, more than 13,000 women were assigned combat status for their service in Donetsk and Luhansk. It is unknown how many women currently serve in the armed forces, although estimates range from 10 to 25 percent, but there is evidence of a growing recognition of women’s ability to contribute to the war effort in a variety of ways. This gives Ukraine a way to buttress its military in numerical terms relative to Russia, which confines the majority of women in its military to noncombat roles. Approximately 41,000 women serve in the Russian military and constitute 4.3 percent of active duty forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Zelenskyy’s narratives have also resisted conventional wartime militarized sexist stereotypes. One analyst observed that “rather than denigrate the Russians by implying they mistreat their women or demonizing their men as monsters, for example, he has blamed the war on Putin directly.” First lady Olena Zelenska’s use of social media includes pictures of women in military uniform in the trenches or women as part of rescue crews with the caption “Our new opposition has a female face to it.” Women combatants are also visible in international media coverage. Headlines shout, “Women Rush to Ukraine’s Defence” and “Ukrainian Women Stand Strong Against Russian Invaders.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If women are not purely damsels in distress, the alternative narrative of gun-strapped blonde soldiers is just as reductive. These types of images in Western and Ukrainian media emphasize the significance of Ukrainian women fighting, which reinforces the notion that women’s participation in wartime violence is exceptional and therefore newsworthy. Women’s participation in armed conflict therefore becomes characterized as abnormal or even “monstrous.” Ukrainian women, however, express similar motivations as men for fighting, that of defense, preservation, survival, and continuity of the state. The Ukrainian military’s claim of being a champion of gender equity also falls short of reality, evidenced by the leadership’s refusal to allow women into senior ranks and most notably by restricting women from command positions outside of women-specific roles or placing them in roles that are distanced from actual combat. Female soldiers also complain of shortages of gear in appropriate sizes and lack of access to military education and training programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military recruitment posters and politicians’ adoption of military-style clothing reflect that the government’s more recent efforts to mobilize its citizens for war are infused with masculine narratives. Focusing on men’s masculine status as soldiers, protectors, or fathers “reinforces masculinist and heteronormative gender ideologies.” This focus ignores the fact that, despite universal forced conscription, many men do not wish to fight and have left the country illegally or are hiding from local military recruiters in plain sight among the roughly 7.1 million people who are internally displaced, 40 percent of whom are male. Those who have left legally because, for instance, they have three or more children are subject to sexist ridicule from fellow Ukrainians and often have trouble renting housing and getting work because landlords and employers may not trust their military exemptions. Meanwhile, men also experience sexual violence during conflict but may deliberately use words such as “abuse” or “torture” rather than recount the sexual aspect of the violence they have incurred for fear that this may compromise their masculinity. Male sexual violence disturbs gender relations for its tendency to strip men of their masculine status as soldier or protector and deliberately feminizes them or labels them as homosexuals in the eye of the perpetrator. This, in turn, further “feminizes conflict-related sexual violence, trauma and vulnerability.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A greater concern is the clash of President Zelenskyy’s progressive narratives with certain Ukrainian military policy. “Forced universal conscription of men in Ukraine and Ukraine’s breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk [is] resurrecting binaries of men as defender-warriors and women as fragile and needing protection.” Although exemptions to conscription were permitted, an immediate effect of this provision was that refugee flows from Ukraine overrepresented women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has serious human rights implications. There are indications that Russian forces appear to be operating under the assumption that all males are combatants, even though unmobilized men retain their civilian status under international law. Men are disproportionately represented in the civilian casualties of the war. Of the 6,595 adult civilian fatalities where the individual’s sex was known, 2,575 were identified as men while 1,767 were identified as women. This pattern was witnessed during the Bosnian war, the most infamous example being the Srebrenica massacre of 7,000 unarmed men and boys. A true gender-integrated military would deconstruct the idea that the distinction between civilian and combatant is based on gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The declaration of martial law has also reinforced the ambiguous position of women who want to serve and the traditional gender norms that position women primarily as victims of rather than participants in armed conflict. This has implications because it determines the international legal regime under which women are protected and affects their access to wartime and postwar resources such as rations, veterans’ benefits, and rehabilitation programs. Similar concerns have been noted in the terrorism field where experts have observed serious implications in the prosecution, risk assessment, and management of women violent extremists in prison (e.g., more lenient sentences for female returnees or insufficient facilities in prisons for women, especially for mothers). Women may also struggle to access rehabilitation and reintegration programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;undermining-the-potential-for-resolving-conflict-and-violence&quot;&gt;UNDERMINING THE POTENTIAL FOR RESOLVING CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burden of responsibility for conflict resolution does not fall on narratives alone. As one international relations expert observed, “Conflict generated by aggressive or militant leaders with vested interests in escalating conflict is generally not amenable to reduction unless intentions change.” Yet, changing images and narratives are part of conflict resolution. Policymakers and commentators point to soft power as one way to reduce tensions, mitigate conflict, and find common ground in international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempts by some Western leaders to undermine President Putin through ridicule are therefore contentious. President Putin is pivotal to Russian narratives. Political legitimacy is centered around a patriarchal understanding of President Putin as a hypermasculine “real” man. In June 2022, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace hit out at President Putin’s “macho” view of the world, which he said was based on “small man syndrome.” His comments came after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated that President Putin’s war in Ukraine was a “perfect example of toxic masculinity.” At the Group of Seven summit around the same time, leaders also mocked President Putin over his infamous bare-chested picture on a horse. Deploying belittling gendered narratives may rally domestic audiences but could constrain political action in the longer run. In fact, ridiculing President Putin feeds into Russia’s own narratives that the West does not respect or understand Russia, which strengthens the Russian leader’s position. If conflict is to be reduced and resolved, hostile imagery eventually must change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither are Russian narratives intrinsically linking militarism with masculinity helpful. Male endorsement of traditional masculinity can be associated with negative outcomes in relation to conflict resolution. It follows that men endorsing beliefs about manhood might avoid the use of conflict resolution strategies perceived as feminine. The Ukraine war has also witnessed a return to gendered narratives about NATO as a “muscular military power,” with “less attention paid to the human stories underpinning the war, particularly the voices of Ukrainian women and their agency, or a concern with how to reach beyond audiences primarily interested in military power.” The WPS agenda has been entirely missing from NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg’s briefings following the numerous high-level meetings and summits that NATO has held in response to the war. Despite commitments in policy, the United States, NATO, and the European Union have done little to demonstrate the mainstreaming of gender in addressing the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This undermines the possibility of a lasting, inclusive peace reflective of the whole of Ukrainian society. Women and other marginalized groups have been largely sidelined from real decision-making at national and global levels in the conflict. An acknowledgement of the gendered impact of armed conflict, as well as the impact on LGBTQ+ communities, is also missing. This draws attention to what many feminists had feared: the disjuncture between the rhetoric and the reality of the global commitment to the WPS agenda. As a result, certain groups and tools that NATO has at its disposal to support a more inclusive response to the war are being sidelined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some steps have been taken, particularly on the Ukrainian side, to move away from conventional, stereotyped gendered narratives in the conflict. This is reflective of the reality on the ground, which has mobilized the entire Ukrainian population against the Russian invasion. Yet, reductive gendered narratives are still prevalent, including among NATO and other Western actors. These narratives have real-world implications that can undermine the safety and security of Ukrainian men and women and are an impediment to longer-term peace and stability in Ukraine and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the terrorism field, the value of narratives and strategic communications to counterterrorism is widely accepted by governments. In academia, research has increasingly focused on how terrorists communicate and what works in response. In part inspired by a desire not to reproduce the narratives of terrorist groups, pushback has been seen in the counterterrorism field. Policymakers and practitioners increasingly recognize the importance of avoiding gender misconceptions and stereotypes, which can ignore women’s capabilities to contribute to counterterrorism and countering violent extremism (CVE) efforts in a range of areas, including as policy shapers, educators, community members, and activists, and acknowledge that a better understanding of the relationship among gender, terrorism, and counterterrorism can help improve counterterrorism and CVE efforts. The Islamic State group’s successful recruitment of women has also challenged perceptions that women are always vulnerable, peaceful, or moderate. This progress is just one of the reasons why it is disappointing that parties to the Ukraine conflict are deploying traditional gendered narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following conclusions and recommendations draw on some of the lessons from the counterterrorism space over the last two decades and are aimed at policymakers and practitioners involved not only in Ukraine but in the wider field of conflict and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leaders should avoid using gender-stereotyped narratives to legitimize military operations. With regard to Ukraine, gendered narratives may strengthen President Putin’s justification for the invasion while ridicule may enhance Russia’s claims that the West does not respect or understand Russia. In the field of terrorism, policymakers need to avoid emulating the narratives deployed by violent extremist groups and promote women’s active role in efforts to counter terrorism and prevent and counter violent extremism. Reductive narratives are damaging to people of all genders and potentially undermine longer-term conflict resolution and efforts to defeat terrorist groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers could draw on the Ukrainian experience to normalize women’s participation in conflict and to emphasize that unmobilized men are civilians. A gender-integrated approach to security must deconstruct the idea that there is a difference between civilians and combatants based on gender. This normalization also needs to address the gender norm stereotypes that are often reproduced around women’s participation in violence and conflict. Additionally, the narrative normalization must be accompanied by the expansion of resources for female or other often marginalized participants, including ensuring access to rehabilitation and reintegration packages for women combatants and women terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers and media should avoid exceptionalizing women’s participation in the conflict. How the media portrays women’s participation in conflict and terrorism can influence public opinion. For example, media attention on the case of Shamima Begum in the United Kingdom entrenched the public, possibly political viewpoint that Begum was “exceptional” and that “extraordinary” measures should be taken against her, including the deprivation of British citizenship. Media training is key to combating sensationalism and polarization while maintaining independence and authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers should adopt an intersectional approach to understanding conflict and terrorism. Countries such as Canada, Finland, France, Spain, and Sweden say they have a feminist foreign policy. Yet, mentions of the deeply gendered harms inflicted by this war and how to better protect people of all genders have been limited. Greater efforts are needed to identify the specific humanitarian needs and the lived experiences of all individuals experiencing conflict and terrorism-related violence in order to more fully account for how inequalities of all kinds influence how and why people engage in violence and how they are impacted by it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite commitments in policy, the United States, NATO, and the EU have done little to demonstrate the inclusion of gender in addressing the conflict. NATO should publicly acknowledge the relevance of a gender perspective and uphold commitments to UN Security Council Resolution 1325 beyond emphasis on the deployment of women as part of NATO’s Response Force. NATO should also explore the use of instruments, such as the NATO Civil Society Advisor Panel, to reach out to Ukrainian civil society and ensure a diversity of voices are heard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成開始作供 稱參加初選為宣揚香港民族理念、選出最多具抗爭意志代議士入立會&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成指協調會倡「會運用」否決權惟被「敷衍」 民主黨代表反對稱或失淺藍票&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成稱以「五大訴求」為「唯一優先標準」審視財案、無意癱瘓立會及要求特首下台&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/S0oGUle.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第99天。參選新界東的鄒家成開始作供，表示參選立會原因是宣揚「香港民族」理念、爭取五大訴求，及執行立法會議員監察制衡政府和「為人民發聲」的職務。鄒指，五大訴求具壓倒性民意支持，且合情合理合法合憲，作為議員應為人民爭取；又指確立香港民族地位是他從政最大願景，而香港民族核心是港人治港，與五大訴求追求民主政制、自由自主的精神相通，故支持五大訴求。鄒庭上解釋本土派理念時，被法官打斷指毋須深究，惟鄒亦指出「香港民族」理念與港獨「唔一樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，認為35+目的就是奪取立法會過半議席，理論上可增加談判籌碼，而他參加初選目的同樣為宣揚香港民族理念、望選取最多「具備抗爭意志」的代議士進入立法會，及認為「無篩選」的初選可讓參選人獲民意授權。鄒亦指，曾擔心作為政治素人要在初選勝出相當困難，但回歸宣揚香港民族理念的「初心」，終放低贏輸考慮，把握初選作為平台宣揚他擁抱的理念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成開始作供-稱參選立會為宣揚香港民族理念&quot;&gt;鄒家成開始作供 稱參選立會為宣揚「香港民族」理念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成今開始作供，他身穿黑色西裝、打黑色領帶，在兩名懲教陪同下步入法庭，向旁聽席及律師點頭。鄒到達座位時向旁聽席雙手合十鞠躬，並微笑舉起拳頭，坐下後與身旁法庭傳譯交談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成其後宣誓，接受大律師陳世傑主問。鄒同意，他於1997年2月出生，現正還柙，此前與母親和4個姐姐同住。鄒案發時23歲，正修讀大學護理系，2020年4月向學校申請休學，為參加立法會選舉準備，而他2019年有參加區議會選舉但落敗。陳世傑問為何他想參選，鄒說：「第一，宣揚香港民族理念；第二，爭取五大訴求；第三，執行立法會議員嘅職務，即係監察政府、制衡政府、為人民發聲等等。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指五大訴求追求民主政制-與香港民族核心理念相通故支持&quot;&gt;鄒指「五大訴求」追求民主政制 與「香港民族」核心理念相通故支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問為何想爭取五大訴求，鄒家成指以兩個角度回答，首先從立法會議員職務的角度，五大訴求是「具壓倒性民意支持」的訴求，而且「合情合理合法合憲」，可在《基本法》框架下達成，「作為立法會議員，應該係要為人民爭取訴求同埋發聲」；而從政治理念角度，「確立香港民族嘅地位係我從政嘅最大願景」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指：「『香港民族』嘅核心，係港人治港；『五大訴求』背後嘅精神，係追求民主政制、自由自主、制度公義，即係港人治港嘅表現。基於我認為五大訴求同我嘅政治理念相通，所以我支持。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問鄒認為何謂五大訴求，鄒表示：「第一，撤回逃犯修訂條例；第二，撤回612暴動定性；第三，釋放所有因為反修例而被捕嘅示威者；第四，成立獨立調查委員會調查警暴；第五，要求重啟政改，達致雙普選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒解釋本土派以本土利益優先與香港民族理念相通-官打斷指毋須深究&quot;&gt;鄒解釋「本土派」以本土利益優先、與香港民族理念相通 官打斷指毋須深究&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續指，鄒家成提到本土意識和「香港民族」，能否簡單解釋是什麼意思。鄒指「本土派」即是「以本土嘅利益為優先，致力守護本土嘅價值、文化、語言等等，我認為本土理念同香港民族理念相通」。惟法官李運騰打斷指不認為需要深究，鄒說「最後一句講埋得唔得呀，唔好意思」，惟李說「No.」。陳世傑續問，「本土意識」和「香港民族」與香港獨立有關嗎？鄒答：「唔一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指奪過半議席本身就是35目的-理論上可增談判籌碼&quot;&gt;鄒指奪過半議席本身就是35+目的 理論上可增談判籌碼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問及協調會議，鄒家成表示，理解協調會議是為9月立法會選舉而準備的工作，最初聽到由戴耀廷和區諾軒提議舉辦，而「35+」意思就是「奪取立法會過半議席」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問那「35+」的目的是什麼？鄒說「個目的就係爭取立法會奪取過半議席囉」。法官陳仲衡問，那取得過半後的目的是什麼？鄒說：「佢本身就係一個目的。」李運騰追問，要達至什麼目的（to what end）？鄒重申：「過半議席囉。」李追問：「但之後呢？（“But then what?”）」鄒答：「理論上就係增加一個談判籌碼。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱無人邀請下主動報名參與新東首次協調會&quot;&gt;鄒稱無人邀請下主動「報名」參與新東首次協調會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒確認，他有出席兩次新東協調會議，但「沒有人邀請我」，而他於2020年3月尾至4月頭時已萌生參加立法會選舉的念頭，當時有朋友告知他戴耀廷和區諾軒「好似搞緊協調會議」並告知他時間地點，他遂向此朋友「報名」，表示想出席首次會議。鄒指該朋友並非圈內人，純粹認識一些區議員，而當時辦協調會議的消息傳播得很遠，幾乎所有區議員都會知。而鄒稱參加首次會議的原因，「純粹想聽吓啲人講啲乜嘢，睇吓啲人就住9月立法會選舉有啲咩嘢嘅睇法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒參加初選目的宣揚香港民族理念選出最多具備抗爭意志代議士&quot;&gt;鄒：參加初選目的宣揚香港民族理念、選出最多「具備抗爭意志」代議士&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問參加初選的主要原因，鄒家成指有三點，首先「選舉本質上係一個廣受市民大眾關注嘅政治活動，係一個宣揚政治理念嘅好平台」，故他參加初選的首個目的「係希望可以宣揚香港民族理念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其次，鄒指初選本質上是一個「去蕪存菁」、「具競爭性」的政治活動，加上他認為35+不可能，故認為「選出最多具備抗爭意志嘅代議士進入立法會，係初選嘅意義」。李運騰指他不明白，鄒提到35+不可能和選出最多具抗爭意志的人入立會之間邏輯上的關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒解釋，基於他認為35+不可能的議會想像，故「要喺35-嘅可預期嘅未來底下，去尋求更大力度嘅制衡行政機關嘅力量」，「協助香港人選出最多具備抗爭意志嘅代議士」，指這是他當時思考的理路，想告知法庭「我嗰陣係咁樣諗嘢嘅啫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指判斷參選人有否抗爭意志交選民決定&quot;&gt;鄒指判斷參選人有否抗爭意志交選民決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰仍面露疑惑，惟陳慶偉笑指「那沒有邏輯的」，並指鄒意思是因為35+不可能，所以初選本質上是選擇最具抗爭意志的人與政府抗爭，鄒同意，指「類似就係更新球隊球員嘅諗法」。陳續說，而球隊人數並不重要，鄒只是想隊伍有最強的球員，鄒同意。法官陳仲衡續以足球隊為例，指鄒如不能組成11人隊伍，也嘗試組成10人隊伍？陳慶偉補充：「甚至只有1人」，鄒同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後問，鄒指初選是要找出最強抗爭意志的鬥士（fighter），但初選如何達致這點？陳並手指向被告席，指他們均來自很闊的政治光譜。鄒回應，要回答此問題，「就回歸到，到底我哋有一張選票，我哋點樣去判斷一個參選人有沒有抗爭意志嘅問題」，陳慶偉指，即是看選民的選擇？鄒指「我的確認為判斷一個參選人有冇抗爭意志係交畀選民決定」，但在競爭過程內，參選人當然可以互相質疑、互相比併。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指初選為無篩選選舉戴耀廷從無提誰有資格參加初選&quot;&gt;鄒指初選為「無篩選」選舉、戴耀廷從無提誰有資格參加初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，第三個參加初選目的，是因初選是一個「無篩選」的選舉。惟陳慶偉即打斷問為什麼，質疑鄒說法不全然正確，指戴耀廷說過只有認同五大訴求的人才能參與，而劉偉聰也提過初選性質不民主，因為會令選民無法選擇大批候選人。鄒解釋，因在新東協調會議，他從無聽過戴耀廷提及「邊個有資格參加初選、邊個冇資格參加初選」；而他認為一般指的「篩選」，是指「第三方嘅權力機構行使公權力去阻止人參選」，而初選並無出現過這個過程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指他明白，但認為只有第三方篩選的說法不全然正確，因立法會選舉是由政府舉辦，由政府進行篩選，而政府嚴格而言不是第三方；而就初選，雖戴耀廷在新東會議沒有這樣說，但不認為戴會讓建制派人士參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱初選可予參選人獲民意授權奉行為人民請命精神&quot;&gt;鄒稱初選可予參選人獲民意授權、奉行為人民請命精神&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒回應，第三方不是指第三或第四、第五個機構，但選舉主任DQ候選人，「我理解為已經僭建咗一個權力嘅部門去處理呢個事情」，並指最關鍵的是「係唔係行使緊公權力去阻止人參選」。鄒又指，戴耀廷「當然係可以阻止建制派參加初選啦，因為呢個係民主派嘅初選」，情況就如社民連辦黨內初選，也要社民連黨員才可參加，「因此我哋又返到去到底咩人先係可以參加民主派初選啦係咪？我會答㗎喇，我覺得五大訴求……」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟李運騰打斷，指毋須知道鄒的意見，而是關注鄒的證供，指戴耀廷無提參加初選資格，似乎與區諾軒證供不同。法官陳慶偉則指，「35+計劃」文件也有提及參選資格，惟鄒指他無收過該份文件，會上也沒有討論、提及或傳閱該份文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒其後補充有關參加初選的第三個目的：「我覺得初選係一個冇篩選嘅選舉，佢係一個機會畀參選人獲得民意授權，奉行為人民請命嘅精神。關於初選嘅參加目的，我冇嘢補充。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指選舉理應是參選人與選民間的事-行政機關以公權力阻參選便屬第三方&quot;&gt;鄒指選舉理應是參選人與選民間的事 行政機關以公權力阻參選便屬第三方&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而鄒小休後就政治篩選的說法補充，表示認為選舉「理應係參選人同埋選民之間嘅事」，行政機關有責任提供一個公平公正的選舉，「如果行政機關行使公權力去阻止人參選，呢個行為本身就係第三方行使公權力去做呢個篩選，因此行政機關就係第三方。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱為宣揚民族理念-放低贏輸考慮參加初選&quot;&gt;鄒稱為宣揚民族理念 放低贏輸考慮參加初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後問，參加立法會選舉是否一定要參加初選？鄒指參加首次協調會議前，他無期望過一定會搞初選，而會上決定辦初選後，「我都冇諗過要參加初選住」，因作為「政治素人」，「我自己知道相對於其他參選人，我嘅政治資本冇咁豐富，例如我冇參選好豐富嘅經驗啦、冇大黨支持、亦冇足夠嘅選舉籌備資金去支持我參加選舉」，因此他當時已經擔心，「我要用一個半月嘅時間，由無人認識，到要初選勝出，係相當困難嘅事情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過鄒指會議後，他與選舉團隊討論，「我哋回歸到我哋嘅初心，就係宣揚香港民族理念，所以我哋放低咗贏輸呢個考慮，把握一啲焦點平台，去宣揚一啲我哋擁抱嘅政治理念」，這亦扣連他參加初選的第一個目的，並指「冇嘢補充」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉笑指他明白，就是鄒不一定要參加初選，但想透過參選提倡其理念，鄒同意，並強調這是他參加完首次協調會議後產生的想法，「因為當時我已經尋找緊參加初選嘅意義。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZczsbzU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第99天。鄒家成繼續作供，新東焦點落在協調會議就否決權的討論，鄒今表示，戴耀廷在第二次會議首度提出「會積極運用《基本法》權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，他當時動議改為「會」運用，惟感覺遭主持的程張迎「敷衍」。鄒承認當時有少少「着咗（ignited）」，並向戴稱不應用如此「模棱兩可」的字眼，民主黨代表則反對其動議，表示這會令他們失去中產和「淺藍」的票，亦指不獲授權投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指當時回應為何經歷完2019年運動，「你哋仲可以講呢啲嘢？你哋瞓醒未呀？」最終戴出來「打圓場」，指「『積極』比冇已經係行前一步」，並轉為討論其他事宜，會上終無舉行投票亦無達成協議。鄒指，他說話時有用肢體語言，但氣氛未去到面紅耳赤、拍枱說粗口的地步，而會後他有就會上不禮貌態度向戴耀廷道歉。鄒並指戴曾稱如有時間會再開多一次會，惟最終並沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指戴耀廷首次新東會議提出擬共同綱領預期有文件簽署&quot;&gt;鄒指戴耀廷首次新東會議提出擬「共同綱領」、預期有文件簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選新界東的鄒家成繼續作供，談及新東協調會議情況。鄒同意，2020年4月可謂他首次參與「35+計劃」的事情，而4月14日首次會上由戴耀廷帶起討論，戴提及將就「共同綱領」的項目討論，達成共識的項目就會變成一份文件讓大家簽署。鄒指當時無特別說誰會簽，但合乎邏輯去想應是參加初選的人會簽；並同意首次會議後，預期之後會有一份文件予大家簽署。鄒亦指會上沒有討論亦沒有人問及誰可參加初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱由始至終不相信35神話&quot;&gt;鄒稱由始至終不相信35+神話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉追問鄒是否期望所有選區都簽同一份文件，鄒先說「應該各區各一份」，其後更正指是「新東自己有一份」，至於其他區「我真係唔知」、亦無預期過會有，他亦沒有想過要所有區有同一份文件。陳慶偉指，但這會很奇怪，因若各區想法不同，如有選區想否決預算案來爭五大訴求、有選區不想，「35+計劃」成功的機會就會減少。鄒回應：「我當時冇諗咁多，可能因為我由始至終，都唔相信35+呢個神話」，並在法官問追下指他協調會議沒有這樣表達，但有在 Facebook 和選舉論壇表達。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指戴曾稱或有第三次會議但終無召開&quot;&gt;鄒指戴曾稱或有第三次會議但終無召開&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，至5月5日第二次會議同樣期望會簽署協議。陳仲衡問他有沒有問及文件的去向？鄒指他沒問過何時有文件，直到6月9日戴耀廷記者會；而他當時亦期望會有第三次協調會議。李運騰問為何有此期望，鄒指因戴耀廷於第二次會議曾表示，如之後有時間會再開多一次協調會議，「但要睇有冇空間」，惟最終沒有開。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱協調共識包括61指戴耀廷認為新東有潛質多取一席&quot;&gt;鄒稱協調共識包括「6+1」、指戴耀廷認為新東有潛質多取一席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續確認，第一次會議達成3點共識，包括辦初選、「贏咗有得選，輸咗冇得選」、及出選名單數目為「6+1」，並指後兩者統稱為「棄選機制」。至於第二次會議則達成兩點共識，包括辦論壇和以靈童制為替補機制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問及，鄒稱想選出最多意志最強的鬥士入立法會，但「6+1」安排不會令成功機會減少嗎？鄒指最終會否派7隊出選是依賴民調結果，而他不熟悉民調如何運作亦無問過，亦無就此表達意見。鄒並指印象中「6+1」由戴耀廷提議，但沒有參與者反對。李運騰問故雖戴提議「6 6 4 4 3」，但他本人在新東卻提議「n+1」？鄒說以其理解，新東以6為目標議席是根據上屆立選結果而暫定，但戴覺得「新東有潛質攞多一席」，故用民調看看「有冇機會攞多一席」。鄒亦不知其他區有否「+1」的安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱第二次會議戴耀廷首提會積極運用否決權&quot;&gt;鄒稱第二次會議戴耀廷首提「會積極運用」否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，在首次新東會議後，鄒家成有否收過總結會議的文件、即名為「35+新東」的協調文件初稿，鄒指「我冇收過」，而首次會議亦無討論過否決權事宜。鄒指他第一次聽到相關討論，是在5月5日第二次會議，大家自我介紹後不久，戴耀廷提出「會積極運用《基本法》嘅權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，戴並補充意思是「可以投，可以唔投」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱動議改為會運用否決權並要求投票-惟遭程張迎敷衍致討論激烈&quot;&gt;鄒稱動議改為「會」運用否決權並要求投票 惟遭程張迎「敷衍」致討論激烈&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒表示他續提出動議，「我動議用『會』而唔要『積極』兩個字」，並要求投票。陳慶偉問，為何戴耀廷一開始就用「會積極運用」的字眼？指此前證供指，那是一個用來妥協的字眼，鄒說「我唔知」。法官追問鄒為何這樣提出，鄒說：「我會解釋嘅，但係唔知可唔可以我依照返當時事件發生嘅次序，然後我再慢慢解答。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續表示，他提出動議後，其中一位主持會議的「（時任沙田區議會主席）程張迎先生」，「佢敷衍我嘅動議、敷衍我嘅睇法，俗啲講就係，我覺得佢 hea 緊我啦」，陳志全和柯耀林等發笑。鄒指，覺得程當時「打算無視我嘅動議」，並想直接討論下一個議題，而對他來說，「我覺得程張迎先生呢一個主持會議嘅方式，先係令到個討論開始激烈嘅原因。」翻譯將激烈討論譯為「heated exchange」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y178xfX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 程張迎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問，激烈（heated）是什麼意思？從何而來？陳慶偉說：「Because 程張迎 hea him」，多人發笑。陳世傑再問激烈從何而來（“Where does the heat come from?”）？鄒重申是不滿程主持會議的方式，但他具體說過什麼，「我覺得佢敷衍緊我，我真係唔記得」。法官陳仲衡續問，「你當時『着咗』（ignited）？」法庭傳譯翻譯為「跟住你着咗燈」，多人大笑，鄒說：「少少啦。」法官陳慶偉笑說：「他當時很年輕，可以理解的（“He was young, you see, understandable.”）」，庭上再傳出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指向戴耀廷稱不應用模棱兩可字眼氣氛未去到面紅耳赤&quot;&gt;鄒指向戴耀廷稱不應用「模棱兩可」字眼、氣氛「未去到面紅耳赤」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續指，他當時開始解釋其動議，並對戴耀廷說：「唔使你講我夠知道，作為立法會議員，可以否決、可以唔否決啦。（但）我哋唔應該用啲咁模棱兩可嘅字眼，既然五大訴求咁清晰，政府冇喺 budget 回應，咁咪投否決囉。」法官陳慶偉續說，「當然你當時會提高了一點聲量，不會像今天這麼平靜」，鄒笑說：「我而家內在都好激動㗎！」林卓廷哈哈大笑，庭上笑聲一片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，「其實嗰個『激烈咗』呢，係相對於本身水靜鵝飛嘅協調會議氣氛，真係未去到面紅耳赤、又拍晒枱企晒起身講晒粗口咁嘅」，而他當時講完後，戴耀廷就冷靜回應「咁你個意思即係點？」，鄒說完並問法官「呢 part OK？」，一直托頭專心望向鄒的陳慶偉說：「If you are OK, I’m OK.」，再引來大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒庭上畫出新東會議座位表-坐民主黨代表對面但不認得是誰&quot;&gt;鄒庭上畫出新東會議座位表 坐民主黨代表對面但不認得是誰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，他遂向戴重申動議「會」運用權力一字，其後就有人反對。鄒續主動向法官提議：「不如我進入下一個部分之前，我簡單講一講當時個座位啦，唔知道法官閣下有冇興趣？」，並即場以法庭比劃當時會議場地面積，指房間大小從被告席後方的牆到大律師 Trevor Beel 的位置；長度則由另一面牆到大律師黃宇逸的位置，黃宇逸一度舉手和笑着站起身，鄒與他打招呼，李運騰指面積約為400呎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指房內以很多桌子砌成一個長方型，並在陳慶偉要求下即場畫出座位表，笑言「但我畫功唔係好靚」。鄒續解釋，若分為兩個「U」型，右邊坐着程張迎、戴耀廷、區諾軒，而程的右邊是民主黨代表，區的左邊則是他、再到何桂藍，換言之他與民主黨代表坐在對方對面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而U的左邊有劉頴匡、呂智恆、社民連代表、沙田區政代表和將軍澳青年力量代表，但鄒不記得他們座位，並指兩次會議均有約30多人出席，主要發言者才坐在桌子旁，部分人則坐在後面。鄒並指，他當時不認識民主黨代表，是庭上聽過莊榮輝和李永成的名字，才知民主黨代表有機會是他們，「但因為我真係唔識佢哋，我唔知邊個打邊個。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱會上有人批評傳統泛民行禮如儀不記得社民連代表發言&quot;&gt;鄒稱會上有人批評傳統泛民「行禮如儀」、不記得社民連代表發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問及鄒講述與程張迎的「激烈」討論，鄒微笑說「激烈」的並非討論，他只是要求程重新就他提出的動議做討論，「我冇鬧佢嘅」，林卓廷大笑。鄒續指，他重提動議後，兩名男民主黨黨員出聲反對，其中一個是林卓廷代表、另一個則無提是代表林卓廷。鄒續在法官陳慶偉追問下，指他記得會上有人批評傳統泛民主派「行禮如儀」，但不是由他所說，亦記得不是特別指民主黨；鄒亦不記得街工有否出席，指有關否決財案的辯論，他主要與民主黨代表對話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指就對話過程「咁肢體語言一定有啦」。陳慶偉指他與民主黨代表「隔住張枱喎」，鄒補充是「手勢嗰隻肢體語言、唔係肢體衝突」，陳問有「手指指（finger pointing）」？鄒說：「我係講嘢有肢體語言啫，我唔係咁樣指住」，邊說邊舉起手指做指人的動作，並笑說：「咁你話有冇一兩下指住佢，我唔知呀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，陳寶瑩有否站起表達社民連立場。鄒稱記得陳寶瑩無出席，而是吳文遠出席，但記得他無「企起身」、亦不記得他說過什麼；至於首次會議，他亦記得陳寶瑩無出席。李運騰追問，即陳寶瑩沒出席過任何一次會議？鄒笑說：「咁講啦，其實我係坐監之後先知道陳寶瑩個樣係點樣嘅」，引來哄堂大笑，坐在旁聽席的陳寶瑩亦跟着發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Xp9Ztof.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳寶瑩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉說，因此若陳當時在場，鄒也不知道？鄒同意，但補充記得首次會議社民連代表是吳文遠和岑子杰，「咁佢兩個係我喺電視見得比較多嘅政治人物，所以我認得佢哋」，至於「你話會唔會佢哋旁聽仲有多一個女士呢，我就真係唔知喇」。陳慶偉追問，那會上有人提過若政府落實全民退保，社民連會支持預算案嗎？鄒說不記得，至於街工有否提過若預算案對基層有利便不會否決，鄒指「可能有人講咁上下嘅說話」，但不知發言者是否街工代表。小休時，鄒家成與陳寶瑩互相揮手笑着打招呼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱提出動議後民主黨代表反對-稱會失中產和淺藍票中委會無授權&quot;&gt;鄒稱提出動議後民主黨代表反對 稱會失中產和淺藍票、中委會無授權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續講述民主黨代表對其動議的反對情況，指有黨員提及「呢個主張會令到佢哋失去中產票同埋淺藍嘅票」及「中委會冇授權佢哋去投票」，但不記得是由誰說，亦有提出很多他覺得「模棱兩可」的審視標準，如反問「做呢樣、做嗰樣，又投反對票呀？」，但不記得舉了什麼例子。鄒並指當時回應：「點解經歷完2019年以五大訴求為主軸嘅社會運動之後，你哋仲可以講呢啲嘢？你哋瞓醒未呀？」，又質問他們「搞初選嘅意義係乜嘢」，「到底點解香港人2020年需要搞一場初選？」，惟他們無回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，但鄒今早提及初選目的是取得過半議席，既然如此為何仍要問民主黨取得答案，鄒回應因他覺得初選意義「不在於此」，並理解「35+」為一個「大會嘅目的」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指戴耀廷以時間有限擱置討論-終未達協議&quot;&gt;鄒指戴耀廷以時間有限擱置討論 終未達協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，之後還有其他人發表意見，「但我真係唔記得喇」，並指由戴耀廷提出該議題到爭拗接近尾聲大約歷時15至20分鐘，有人反對也有人支持，之後戴「就叫做出嚟打圓場咁啦」，表示「時間有限，仲有嘢未傾」、「之後有時間再傾」，並決定將此議題擱置，續討論論壇和替補機制事宜，最終沒有就否決權字眼舉行投票，亦沒有達成協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，因此不是戴耀廷以「積極」用字嘗試迎合否決和不否決兩方的分歧？鄒指在新東第二次會議，「我的確唔覺得佢有咁嘅表現」，但戴在「打圓場」時有表示「『積極』比『冇』已經係行前一步」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒否認會上提無差別否決及癱瘓政府等-會後就不禮貌態度向戴道歉&quot;&gt;鄒否認會上提無差別否決及癱瘓政府等 會後就不禮貌態度向戴道歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問及，鄒家成在第二次會議有否提過會無差別否決預算案，及會用盡一切手段迫政府回應五大訴求，鄒否認，並指當時的爭拗主要關於審視預算案的標準，及批評泛民以往言行，而非爭取五大訴求的方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就黎敬輝筆記指鄒曾說「如我們不決意，如何說服香港人於初選投票，推我地入去立法會癱瘓政府」，鄒亦沒有說過，也沒說過癱瘓政府。陳慶偉望着鄒家成笑出聲，並問：「你肯定沒有？」鄒答：「係」，他亦不認識黎敬輝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，在會議完結後與戴耀廷有一個短暫對話，他向戴表示「我會參加初選」，並就剛才會上的不禮貌態度向他道歉，之後戴就叫了一個他不認識的人前來取得他的電話號碼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BX6HBN1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第99天。鄒家成繼續作供，就他在協調會議主張「會」否決預算案，鄒稱與「無差別」否決有別，因他目的是爭取五大訴求、以五大訴求為「唯一優先標準」審視財案，若預算案「一蚊都唔關（五大訴求）事」便要反對。鄒又強調，若政府落實五大訴求會在預算案反映，惟法官李運騰質疑鄒無做過立法會議員，法官陳慶偉亦提到過往曾主持的「鉛水事件」獨立調查委員會無列在預算案。鄒並指，會透過積極審議和將議會資訊帶去社區和網絡，向政府施壓要求回應五大訴求，但他無意以癱瘓立法會及要求特首下台為施壓手段，認為林鄭下台「冇意思」，「個制度一日唔變，邊個上台都一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，當局曾於2016年回覆議員就預算案的提問，指2016/2017年行政署「其他僱用服務及專業費用」較上一年度增加4,400萬，主因包括食水含鉛超標調查委員會所需法律服務開支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱會否決與無差別否決有別是以五大訴求為唯一優先標準審視財案&quot;&gt;鄒稱「會否決」與「無差別否決」有別、是以五大訴求為「唯一優先標準」審視財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成今作供，提及第二次新東協調會議上，曾就戴耀廷提出的「會積極運用《基本法》權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，動議改為「會」運用字眼，因認為不應用如此「模棱兩可」的字眼，但遭民主黨代表反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師陳世傑續問，鄒提到的「會否決」和「無差別否決」一樣嗎？鄒說「唔一樣」，表示他所說的「會否決財政預算案」，目的是「爭取五大訴求」，「對我嚟講，就係以五大訴求作為唯一優先嘅標準，去審視財政預算案。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EJEQDym.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表鄒家成的大律師 陳世傑&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，即是作為談判籌碼？鄒指當時無特別去想是否談判籌碼，「我純粹覺得，群眾要求五大訴求，咁我哋就要入議會，為人民爭取五大訴求」，並解釋政府如在預算案有一些促成五大訴求落實的撥款內容，就會再根據整份預算案的利弊，再決定投票取態；而「如果審視完財政預算案，入面係一蚊都唔關事嘅話，我覺得就要投反對票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續解釋，他是第二次協調會議後才萌生這想法，認為是會上有關否決權的爭拗刺激到他有此想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落無悔已向政府表明就財案看法談判存在於審視財案過程內&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落無悔」已向政府表明就財案看法、談判存在於審視財案過程內&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續關注預算案如何反映五大訴求，指首先政府已撤回《逃犯條例》，故不會在預算案反映，鄒同意。陳慶偉並指鄒當然要先向政府提出訴求並作商討，才會反映在預算案。鄒回應稱「墨落無悔」聲明書本身是一個公開及事先表達的立場，「我覺得呢個已經係向緊政府表達，我哋對財政預算案嘅睇法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續認為，談判「根本就存在喺審視財政預算案嘅過程裡面」，指財政司司長發表預算案前，議員會收到司長二讀時發表的演辭，及牽涉每個部門撥款的管制人員報告，議員其後可向各部門提交書面提問，「基本上就問乜都得」，而之後進入特別財委會階段，「根本就係一個談判嘅階段」，在談判過程可看到預算案有否回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒引盧偉聰說法-指個人認為撤回612暴動定性早落實&quot;&gt;鄒引盧偉聰說法 指個人認為撤回612暴動定性早落實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉追問，但像「撤回暴動定性」如何反映在預算案？鄒提到第一次協調會議上，戴耀廷有就「五大訴求」發表意見，提及當時社會已在討論不用再提撤回612暴動定性，因不想影響爭取雙普選的進度；而鄒個人亦認為此訴求「一早已經落實咗」，指2019年6月12日後不久，時任警務處處長盧偉聰曾見記者說：「我唔係話大家係暴徒。」法官李運騰打斷，指不認為需知道所有細節，並指最終是否暴徒並不是警務處長決定，而是法庭決定。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 時任警務處處長 盧偉聰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並在法官追問下指，戴會上提到對五大訴求的理解，與他的理解並無不同，而戴當時並非談及參加初選資格，只是提到「出面有好多人爭取五大訴求、要求五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑鄒家成未做過立法會議員-如何得知預算案必反映五大訴求&quot;&gt;官質疑鄒家成未做過立法會議員 如何得知預算案必反映五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰亦追問，鄒是想看到政府花錢回應五大訴求、抑或想政府回應五大訴求？指兩者或不一樣。鄒回應：「以撥款嘅方式回應五大訴求，就係促成五大訴求嘅落實」。李運騰續說，但鄒從來無做過立法會議員，鄒說：「係，但我識得睇電視同睇 YouTube」，李再說：「所有人都可以，中學生都可以」，再指鄒未做過立法會議員。鄒續說：「正因為我唔係一個立法會議員，所以我會嘗試喺唔同嘅途徑去學習點樣做一個立法會議員，我中學嘅時候……」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟李運騰打斷，並說「我知道你想學習一些東西，亦有不少東西是你要學習，其中一樣就是聆聽問題」，並指其問題是鄒如何知道政府對五大訴求的回應必然會花錢，而即使要花錢，又必然會反映在預算案？鄒再回應指，財政預算案是政府未來如何用錢的計劃，「要落實五大訴求，就會喺 budget 反映」，鄒欲舉例，惟李運騰打斷指知道這是鄒當時所相信的就可以了&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官以鉛水事件為例-指獨立調查委員會訴求不會反映在預算案&quot;&gt;法官以「鉛水事件」為例 指「獨立調查委員會」訴求不會反映在預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後續問，成立獨立調查委員會的訴求，會如何反映在預算案。惟李運騰認為不需要問，指是鄒家成相信預算案會反映，而他不是會計、沒有金融背景、沒做過立法會議員，法庭只關注他當時的想法。鄒家成一度望向被告席方向搖頭苦笑，並主動謂：「如果覺得我講得好空泛，不如我試吓畀例子啦」，惟法官陳慶偉阻止，並主動提到他本人曾主持由前立法會議員黃碧雲有份要求成立、有關「鉛水事件」的獨立調查委員會，而該調查委員會從來沒有反映在預算案。陳慶偉提到黃碧雲時，黃一度在座位上舉手示意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KIcVDGF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃碧雲&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，他不是要批評鄒，只是以此為例，指「鉛水事件」突然出現，從沒有寫在任何預算案，因此即使當局回應鄒家成這個訴求，也不會反映在預算案。陳又指這可以是鄒家成的想法，「但我在告訴你我的真實經驗（“But I am telling you my real experience.”）」，又指獨立調查委員會涉數以千萬開支。陳說話時何桂藍不斷在位上說話，林卓廷和陳志全等亦有討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續表示，法庭並不關注鄒家成想法的對錯，而是關注他當刻所信的如何影響其行為，「他可能是對、可能是錯，但我們無需就此下決定。」陳世傑追問，因此該訴求可能或可能不會反映在預算案？鄒回應就「鉛水事件」的例子，獨立調查委員會是由立法會主導，該提案方式是不會在預算案顯示。李運騰重申不關注其想法對錯，而是他所相信的如何影響他行為，不用再深究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，食水含鉛超標調查委員會由行政長官會同行政會議根據《調查委員會條例》於2015年委任，獨立調查委員會相關開支，由財政預算案總目142「政府總部：政務司司長辦公室及財政司司長辦公室」下分目000「運作開支」中支付。當局曾於2016年回覆時任民主黨立法會議員單仲楷就預算案的提問，指2016/2017年行政署「其他僱用服務及專業費用」較上一年度增加4,400萬，主因包括食水含鉛超標調查委員會所需法律服務開支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年，時任公民黨立法會議員陳淑莊在審議財政預算案時，亦曾向當局問及沙中線獨立調查委員會的開支，行政署長當時回覆指截至2019年2月28日，開支合共約3,550萬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成稱議會內寸土必爭以五大訴求為標準審視財案-迫政府回應五大訴求&quot;&gt;鄒家成稱議會內「寸土必爭」、以五大訴求為標準審視財案 迫政府回應五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續表示，同意向政府施壓，迫使政府回應五大訴求。被問用什麼手段，鄒指涉他主張議會內「寸土必爭」的抗爭方式，即積極審議每一個議案和法案、積極提出修正案和私人草案，並將議會資訊帶去社區和提升到網絡層面，「希望借此產生一股更加強大制衡行政機關嘅力量，為落實五大訴求帶來可能」；至於另一手段就是已提及的「以五大訴求作為唯一優先標準，審視財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，施壓手段不包括癱瘓立法會，亦不認為立法會會被癱瘓。陳世傑追問原因，鄒說「如果根據法庭一直講嗰個35+之後係癱瘓到立法會……」，惟李運騰即打斷，並以手指指向鄒家成嚴肅指出：「我必須澄清，法庭從來沒有這樣說過，你或許之前聽過，但這不是法庭的說法，你要非常清楚區分。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒說「明白，唔好意思」，續指就庭上聽到民主派取得35+後可癱瘓立法會的說法，「我認為唔可能，因為我覺得35+從來都唔可能」，又一度稱解散立法會權力「從來都喺特首度」。法官指解散立法會是另一回事，陳仲衡則指陳志全曾稱如立法會有35+，立法會或開不到會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱無意圖癱瘓立會及要求特首下台&quot;&gt;鄒稱無意圖癱瘓立會及要求特首下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒說：「如果咁樣為之癱瘓立法會嘅話，咁我覺得係會有可能發生」，但指他從沒有意圖癱瘓立法會。至於以迫特首下台為手段來迫使政府回應五大訴求，鄒表示：「我從來冇打算要求林鄭下台，我覺得佢下台冇意思，個制度一日唔變，邊個上台都一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續指將就「墨落無悔」聲明發問，望下一日處理。李運騰關注陳曾稱有200條問題，現時問了多少，陳指問到第46條，李問他能否再縮短提問，陳表示在嘗試。案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳志全被質疑無提35+願望無法實現 反問「生日許願世界和平你覺得可達到？」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BIc0FU6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（3日）踏入審訊第98天。控方引述陳志全街站發言，問他參選目標是否對抗「港共政權」，陳指民主派在議會的對手是建制派和政府，要求改變政策不完善之處、並就港人想得到的向政府施壓，「咁呢個係咪叫做對抗政權呢？如果呢個係咁咪係囉」。控方又質疑，陳於街站提到願望是達成35+，但沒提35+是無法實現，陳即反問：「當你生日許願話世界和平嘅時候，你覺得世界和平可唔可以達到吖？」，並指雖認為35+可能性低，但「贏到多過人哋咁梗係好事」、「係你個願望嚟咋嘛」。法官問他是「抱最好的希望，但做最壞的打算」？陳答：「我做人不嬲都係咁樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方引譚得志在初選論壇稱，會以否決預算案爭取五大訴求，及如政府「一人派十皮嘢」也會反對，陳否認代表其立場，直言「人人派十萬你都否決，畀人斬啊真係」。陳今完成3天作供，散庭後興奮說：「哇做完喇，真係開心喇！」，而下一名作供的被告鄒家成今特意穿上西裝上庭，他將於明天開始作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱抗爭到底是指盡力開會發言等-因有議員未盡全力抗爭&quot;&gt;陳稱「抗爭到底」是指盡力開會發言等 因有議員未盡全力抗爭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全今繼續接受盤問，開庭前，料在陳志全之後作供的鄒家成，首度身穿黑色西裝、打上黑色領帶入庭，多名旁聽人士起哄，紛紛驚嘆：「哇，好靚仔呀！」、「原來咁靚仔嘅！」，鄒微笑，有旁聽人士亦上前對他舉起拇指，鄒報以拇指微笑回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;開庭後，周天行再次引述昨播放陳2020年6月底的將軍澳街站片段，提到無論誰當選，「喺未來都要同心協力抗爭到底，包括我哋之前話，不惜運用基本法賦予立法會議員嘅權力，嚟去否決財政預算案，迫使林鄭月娥政府重啟政改，回應五大訴求，達至雙普選」，指陳的發言清楚說明「抗爭到底」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳笑着反問：「你認為係咩呢？」李運騰指控方是指陳發言提到「抗爭到底」的意思，問抑或有其他意思。陳指昨日已看畢片段，強調「抗爭到底」意思就是議員要開會、加入委員會、發言質詢等，不可因作為少數派輸了，就說「你投我多啲，投我入去下次先可以改變到」；而陳推銷「抗爭到底」口號，是因過去有議員抗爭「未盡全力」、「未做足」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指雖以前提否決財案但林鄭無法話事-惟即使如此也要投票展現力量&quot;&gt;陳指雖以前提否決財案但林鄭無法話事 惟即使如此也要投票展現力量&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全續補充，「運用基本法權力，包括否決財政預算案」一說他當然在街站講過，「我都唔需要迴避呢樣嘢。」惟法官陳仲衡即指陳志全不是說「包括」否決財案，而是「不惜」否決，指兩者有別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全同意，但如昨日重申，他之後有說「今時今日依個 step 已經跳咗」，意思就是他以前雖在不同情況說過運用基本法權力否決預算案，但現在「我已經唔係同你講呢樣嘢、呢個唔係我嘅主題」；而他續提到林鄭月娥是「傀儡」，就是指「其實邊個做都係咁㗎啦，不過即使係咁，大家都要出嚟投票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方問對抗林鄭無用應對抗中共-陳就算是傀儡不代表可完全不理&quot;&gt;控方問對抗林鄭無用應對抗中共？ 陳：就算是「傀儡」不代表可完全不理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問何謂「邊個做都係咁」，陳解釋是指林鄭只是執行指令、「話唔到事」。李追問，意思是即使特首下台，也不會改變政府政策？陳指「我驚我過份解讀、為咗自己辯護咁樣，但應該有呢個意思囉」，並重申他當時是指無論如何，大家都要出來投票，「唔好講話要唔要政府回應、改變呀，（最低限度）都可以展現到香港人嘅力量。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行追問，因此陳志全意思是對抗（fight against）林鄭月娥無用，應對抗中共？陳說：「咁又絕對唔可以咁講」，並以修訂《逃犯條例》一事為例，指也是由林鄭月娥宣布「壽終正寢」。陳續說，雖然相信林鄭要有中央政府「首肯」才可做此決定，但在議會或香港「我哋對口單位都係特區政府」，「所以你又唔能夠話就算佢係傀儡，可以完全唔理佢，因為佢都係透過佢嘅手佢嘅口佢嘅政策，令到香港人生活可以改善。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦主動補充，就「包括我哋之前話」一句提到「我哋」，「我唔想拖其他人落水」，指他用「我哋」其實是令人「唔好覺得咁自我中心」的說法，「即係有時唔講『I』，講『we』咁解啫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳反問向政府施壓是否對抗政權指自己是可合作對象為鐵一般事實&quot;&gt;陳反問向政府施壓是否「對抗政權」、指自己是可合作對象為「鐵一般事實」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續引陳於街站提到，議會戰線是抗爭運動的一部分，而議席和議會均是「工具」，「抗爭至係我哋嘅目標，對付呢個港共政權，對付呢個國安惡法至係我哋嘅目標」。周指陳參加初選的目標，就是要對抗「港共政權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳回應，民主派作為反對派，在議會內的對手就是建制派和特區政府，他們每日都要「鬥智鬥力」找出政策上不完善之處要求改變，並向政府施壓要求落實港人想得到但政府不肯落實的事，「咁呢個係咪叫做對抗政權呢？如果呢個係咁咪係囉」。但陳補充，他與建制派和政府，很多情況下也要合作，才能達成改善港人生活的政策，而無論在建制派抑或政府官員之間，「我都係一個可以合作可以溝通嘅對象，呢個係鐵一般嘅事實。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全其後欲舉例，惟陳慶偉打斷，指明白陳過去會與政府合作、亦知道陳的往續，但陳同意他在街站上從沒有提及他會與政府合作通過議案，反而提到會對政權「抗爭到底」嗎？陳說「當然」，指當時街站除了呼籲在初選投票，亦是告知市民《國安法》的危險，並笑言：「當你講緊呢樣嘢嘅時候，你唔會再話我又同政府好合作、我又幫佢過過咩草案咁，咁好分裂㗎嘛個人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dT9Dfc7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳志全&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱議會戰線指積極發言提問不讓建制派快刀斬亂麻通過大量議案&quot;&gt;陳稱議會戰線指積極發言提問、不讓建制派「快刀斬亂麻」通過大量議案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續指，但「對付（港共政權）」一詞應與陳志全提到「議會戰線」、「抗爭」等一同解讀。陳回應在街站也有提及「唔好畀佢有好日子過」，意指如議員不在場、不積極提問發言，可能政府一日已可通過很多議案撥款，而「守住議會戰線」就是指「唔好畀佢快刀斬亂麻」，在港人不知情下通過很多撥款議案，舉例政府可能想一星期內通過議案，「咁我哋守住不斷發言或者提問就可以令佢兩三個禮拜過到」，亦是一直以來他講議會戰線的原則。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又主動指，以往民主派與建制派矛盾「冇咁大」時，可能立法會星期三黃昏就開完會；但他進入議會後，多數都要星期四下午或夜晚才開得完，「咁我話冇畀佢哋有好日子過呢，就係佢哋星期三晚想去馬場跑馬呢都去唔到。」陳欲再補充，惟陳慶偉打斷指相信已聽夠了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑提35為願望但無提無法實現-陳生日許願世界和平你覺得可否達到&quot;&gt;控方質疑提35+為願望但無提無法實現 陳：生日許願世界和平你覺得可否達到？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續引陳志全街站提及今年有3個願望：「第一個當然係民主派嘅議席過半；第二呢，我係希望快必可以當選；第三呢，先至到我自己連任。」周質疑早前稱認為35+機會很微的陳，提到願望是達成35+，但卻從沒有提及35+是無法實現（not achievable），陳志全即加快語速反問：「當你生日許願話世界和平嘅時候，你覺得世界和平可唔可以達到吖？」被告席的鄒家成微笑以手勢示意陳冷靜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續指，可以理解陳的答案是「不」？陳欲解釋，惟法官李運騰打斷，指不認為證人需要再解釋，指：「願望是一個渴望，能否達成是另一回事。（“A wish is a desire, whether it is achievable is a different aspect.”）」陳慶偉續問，那陳志全在街站是說自己也不相信的話嗎？陳指認為「希望」和「相信」沒有衝突，雖然認為35+可能性很低，「但係呢個贏多一席得一席、贏到多過人哋咁梗係好事嚟㗎，咁係你個願望嚟咋嘛。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指發言最後也有提到對於有人說35+，「得到咁梗係好啦」，但「就算唔得，我哋都要好努力喺議會裡面工作」，並重申「就算覺得佢（35+）唔能夠得到或者唔係好大可能性，但係希望得到呢個，係冇衝突囉我覺得」。法官陳仲衡問，所以陳志全是「抱最好的希望，但做最壞的打算（“So you were hoping for the best, but prepared for the worst?”）」？陳回應：「我做人不嬲都係咁樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方問陳是否知戴耀廷對35目標看法-官打斷稱已問過&quot;&gt;控方問陳是否知戴耀廷對35+目標看法 官打斷稱已問過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續再問及陳志全對初選目的之認知，問陳是否知道戴耀廷於7月6日記者會，提到35+目標是運用基本法賦予的權力否決預算案，迫特首下台。陳指無看記者會直播、僅看事後報導，當時無特別留意。李運騰續問，由3月至7月，陳知道戴形容否決權為「大殺傷力憲制武器」嗎？陳重申從報導或「攬炒十步」文章知道大約意思，「但係咪 exact wording 我講唔到。」周再問，而陳同意戴有關35+目標的想法？惟陳慶偉打斷指昨天已問過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周再問陳是否知道戴於7月9日記者會，亦提及35+目標是取得立會主導權，行使憲制權力令港府問責，陳指不記得，因戴「講嚟講去都係嗰啲，都係差唔多㗎啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方就譚得志論壇發言發問-官指兩人同政黨不代表譚代表陳說話&quot;&gt;控方就譚得志論壇發言發問 官指兩人同政黨不代表譚代表陳說話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後就選舉論壇發問，周天行指沒爭議譚得志6月26日出席九東論壇，而陳志全出席6月28日新東論壇，並向陳指「兩者相隔兩日」，惟法官陳仲衡即不耐煩說：「你不需問這問題，對嗎？（“You don’t need to ask that question, do you?”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全在盤問下指，事前沒有與譚得志討論他論壇上會說什麼。周天行問，陳對譚論壇上要說的話不感興趣？陳答：「我哋唔係第一次選舉，選舉都係各自照顧自己，邊有咁得閒去傾吓你個論壇講咩、我個論壇講咩啫。」周追問二人屬同一政黨，不需商討出一致的做法嗎？惟陳慶偉即打斷說「thank you」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳志全稱無與譚得志討論論壇發言&quot;&gt;陳志全稱無與譚得志討論論壇發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續在盤問下指，沒有看九東論壇，但譚得志去完後有告訴陳自己「畀黃之鋒捅咗一嘢」，指黃「話佢（譚）曾經鬧過梁天琦係『無賴本土派』，問佢認唔認、問佢會唔會道歉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周欲追問，惟法官李運騰打斷，要求控方交代盤問的相關性，指兩人同屬一個政黨，不代表譚得志是代表陳志全說話，周回應會在結案陳詞處理。李運騰再指，控方要記住法庭已裁定「共謀者原則」並不適於《國安法》前的言行，除非有基礎譚得志在論壇上是代表陳志全說話。陳慶偉亦着控方直接問問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方問譚得志提否決財案是否陳立場-陳人人派十萬都否決畀人斬啊真係&quot;&gt;控方問譚得志提否決財案是否陳立場 陳：人人派十萬都否決，畀人斬啊真係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示謄本，譚得志提及：「如果我真係有幸入到去，兩次否決《財政預算案》丶癱瘓個政府、林鄭柒婆落台嚟到做 bargaining power（籌碼），爭取五大訴求、缺一不可，尤其是係獨立調查委員會，查嗰個警暴嘅問題，同埋公民提名嘅雙真普選」，又指「如果嗰個財政預算案，每個香港人派一幢樓喎、一人派十皮嘢喎咁，即係志偉呀，同埋阿文豪嗰啲，就平時都反對派錢㗎喇，但係今次派十皮嘢喎咁點呀？一樣反對，因為呢個係我哋嘅選舉承諾」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行問，這也是陳志全參與初選的立場？陳大聲答：「絕對不是呀，呢個仲違反人民力量所講嘅『全民直接回水』」，指人力「爭取咗咁多年」，由「Day 1」已要財政司司長「回水」，「人人派十萬你都否決，畀人斬啊真係」，林卓廷說「哇」。陳續說，譚從來沒有向他講過「人人派層樓、或者人人派十萬」也會否決財政預算案，「我覺得佢都可能係即場爆肚，不過我唔幫佢解釋啦，唔揣測。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳志全作供完畢-料明由鄒家成作供&quot;&gt;陳志全作供完畢 料明由鄒家成作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周最後指出，陳在2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日，與其他被告同意立會過半後無差別否決預算案，以迫使政府回應五大訴求，陳說「絕不同意」。周再指陳意圖顛覆國家政權，陳再說「不同意」，控方表示完成盤問。馬維騉表示沒有覆問，陳完成作供，微笑手執水杯和背包步入被告席，坐下後與鄒家成說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉表示完成辯方案情，料由鄒家成作供。代表鄒的大律師陳世傑表示，需更多時間索取指示，望押至明早開始案情。李運騰指望辯方能令主問盡量簡短，陳說：「你知道我會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭後，鄒家成向律師雙手合十，又主動搭陳志全的肩膊，步入囚室前李予信與鄒簡單交談。陳志全步出被告欄時，則興奮說：「哇做完喇，真係開心喇！」&lt;/p&gt;

As African leaders make their way back from the Russia–Africa Summit in St Petersburg, will we get hints about the company’s future on the continent and how should others respond?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 27 July African leaders made their way to St Petersburg for the second Russia–Africa Summit. The first summit four years ago majored on trade, investment and development. These are issues of concern to Africa but the agenda was Moscow’s. Discussions this time will be tainted by African states’ growing agitation at their place in the world, the economic costs of the Ukraine War, and by persistent problems of insecurity across Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wagner Group has been one of many imperfect answers to insecurity in Africa, or at least regime insecurity. Starting in Sudan, Wagner has been developing its presence on the continent since 2017. Under the Omar Al-Bashir government the company trained the Sudanese armed forces, guarded mineral resources and helped to suppress political opposition. In what has become a familiar pattern, Wagner received exclusive access to mineral and resource extraction by occupying mines and agreeing special deals and concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working alongside front and sister companies, since then the company has sold a menu of services to embattled African governments, including strategic communications, close protection, military training, offensive military operations and logistics. The Touadéra government in the Central African Republic (CAR) signed a contract with Wagner in 2018. Although now fully reliant on Wagner for regime security, it has survived despite effective state failure. In 2019 an ill-fated Wagner deployment to Mozambique saw company fighters bested by an Islamist insurgency. The company also supported rebel Libyan Arab Armed Forces. In Mali since 2021, Wagner has propped up the military government with force and crafted strategic communication campaigns that helped to exacerbate anti-French sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-the-appeal&quot;&gt;Understanding the Appeal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, Wagner has been effective in quelling insurgency and bolstering government authority, although not necessarily legitimacy. It has faced accusations of human rights abuses and international humanitarian law violations on several occasions. In Mali and CAR the UN working group on the use of mercenaries called for investigations following a number of reported rapes, attacks and killings of civilians. Among other things, in Libya in 2020 Wagner was accused of using landmines that killed civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In some cases, Wagner has been effective in quelling insurgency and bolstering government authority, although not necessarily legitimacy. It has faced accusations of human rights abuses and international humanitarian law violations on several occasions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the country-level, Wagner’s services are marketed by Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) representatives within embassies. Host governments such as CAR and Mali have agreements not with Wagner but with the Russian government. The government-to-government negotiations have allowed Wagner and linked Russian companies to benefit financially. Exploitation of commodities such as gold or timber in Sudan or CAR has in turn contributed to Russia’s sanction-busting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Wagner has also proven an effective foreign policy tool. In recent years, Africa was not high on Moscow’s priority list, but the Ukraine War gave it added significance. Russia has tried to win the narrative argument with key African states to avoid isolation. Both the St Petersburg Summit and Wagner are part of a “charm offensive”. With some success, Russia brands itself as an anti-colonial friend to African governments, untainted in comparison to France, the UK and the rest. The Wagner operation in Mali for example helped to change attitudes to the UN and French security missions, paving the way for France’s humiliating exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For selected African governments, then, the package of services on offer has proved appealing. Lectured by domestic and external critics, unable to persuade the UN or allies such as France to fight and die at scale in the face of insurgencies, they have been offered regime protection – at a price. Investigations have illustrated the risks associated with Wagner, but these are largely borne by marginalised populations in the periphery of host countries. Lawlessness may actually be an attraction in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-the-prigozhin-mutiny&quot;&gt;Implications of the Prigozhin Mutiny&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow knows that African host governments viewed its handling of the mutiny closely. Two days later, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov used Russia Today to reassure Mali and CAR that Wagner’s “work” in both countries would continue. It was therefore reassuring that around 500 new personnel arrived in CAR on a scheduled rotation in mid-July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good? Perhaps. But behind the scenes at the summit a sub-set of African leaders will press for clarity on Wagner’s continental operations. Yevgeny Prigozhin was on hand in St Petersburg to meet government representatives, and presumably to court new suitors. The target list could include a dozen or more states with whom there have been reports of Wagner interaction, from Zimbabwe, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and South Africa. The embattled military government of Burkina Faso and the fledgling junta in Niger will be front-runners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-scenarios&quot;&gt;Future Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin will not “abandon” Africa – that would taint its burgeoning brand as a trusted partner for needy governments. But that tells us little about Wagner which is being restructured and largely absorbed into the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Kremlin will not “abandon” Africa – that would taint its burgeoning brand as a trusted partner for needy governments&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One scenario is that the company is disbanded. There are around 20 other companies linked to the Russian government that could play “host” to Wagner personnel and services. Three are controlled by Gazprom, one by Rosatom. By going down this route, the Russian government would retain Wagner’s capabilities and might even enhance the aspect of deniability that has proven useful in the past. But the move would be disruptive. African field operations are managed by men loyal to Prigozhin, such as Dmitri Utkin or Ivan Aleksandrovich Maslov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if Wagner is downsized in Europe but licensed to continue its overseas operations, perhaps Prigozhin could remain at the helm in Belarus. The Kremlin could also reduce any residual risks that it felt around Prigozhin’s leadership by hiving off some of the “menu” of services to sister companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors will shape the direction of travel from now on. The fate of Russia’s combat operations in Ukraine will be one. A sound defeat for Russia in Ukraine would probably spell an end to Wagner’s Africa operations. But this is looking very unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second is resourcing. Until now, the Russian government has not had the bandwidth or resources to invest heavily in Africa and has had to subsidise the company nearly $1 billion per annum despite its income-generation schemes. With the Russian economy in a growth phase, there could be fresh resource on offer to promote or to support Wagner in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third issue will be the Kremlin’s overall prioritisation of Africa. The continent has been a low priority overall, hence the “outsourcing” of policy to the MFA. Whether or not the Kremlin takes a stronger hand in future, the tone and the commitments announced at the summit indicate a sharper focus by Russia. But the events in Niger also highlight the importance of elite and public opinion on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wagner-in-context&quot;&gt;Wagner in Context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week a UK Foreign Affairs Committee report charged the UK government with having for a decade “under-played and under-estimated the Wagner Network’s activities, as well as the security implications of its significant expansion”. It lamented the early withdrawal of UK troops from Mali in 2022 and pushed for further information on how the government will “tackle the challenge of states’ malign use of proxy PMCs”. The UK and the US have now sanctioned Wagner members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the report, coupled with events in St Petersburg will prompt some reflection. Wagner is a player in selected parts of Africa, and a feature of Russia’s foreign policy toolkit. But its wider importance can be exaggerated. A quick internet search throws up a small selection of the numerous private security and military operations in Africa which originate everywhere from Israel to France, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner may be projecting Russian foreign policy goals but it is useful to see it in this wider context. Wagner is one of many private military companies operating in Africa. When taken together with other admittedly very different “non-state” security providers and interventions (peacekeeping and stabilisation missions, train and equip projects, private security companies and community militias) it is striking how little has been achieved in improving security in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Western countries and the UN should be reflecting. They will not and should not match the Wagner offer. Sending troops or mercenaries to fight and advise during aggressive counterinsurgency operations is not on the cards for most. But hard thinking is needed about the persistent insecurity that Wagner and others latch on to. Better external security assistance – well mandated and overseen – can help. But there are also some uncomfortable truths that need airing about everything from state corruption, to extractive economic relations, destabilising military interventions as well as previous reluctance to resource peacebuilding or to back the regulation of private military and security operations. It may be too early to predict Wagner’s next move but the continent will remain open for the security business until all this changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yiqB3vi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（2日）踏入審訊第97天。陳志全今開始接受盤問，就法官關注初選是以立會過半為手段，達至否決預算案的目的，陳表示由始至終不認同否決預算案是初選目的，指理解初選最終目的就是贏得最多議席向政府施壓，要求回應五大訴求等。陳又指，取得過半自然有很多權力，「你唔講，政府都知道你有咩權力」，但認為否決預算案是很遙遠的事，當時想法是「選到至算」。法官問否決預算案是否迫使政府回應的最強大權力，陳指理論上很多人以為是，但操作上則不然，解釋若民主派過半，拒絕合作湊夠35人的法定開會人數，建制派連啟動會議的能力都沒有，「第一日都唔知開唔開到會」，財政預算案「首讀二讀都讀唔到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，陳表示不知道有新東協議文件，指該文件提到會派7張名單，但他認知一直是派6張名單，強調新東能獲6席已是奇蹟，若派7張名單會有很大風險，如他看過「一定會出聲」。陳亦強調，簽署「墨落無悔」聲明是因認同當中兩點聲明，而非因是協調會議共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱於2016年起任人力主席-直至被捕後退出人力&quot;&gt;陳稱於2016年起任人力主席 直至被捕後退出人力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉今早表示已完成主問，陳志全先接受李予信一方盤問，再接受主控周天行盤問。陳在控方盤問下指，應於2016年起任人民力量主席，直至2021年被捕後退出人力。他記不清譚得志何時開始任副主席，但一定是於2020年前，解釋自己本來打算做兩年主席再交予譚，但譚當時說「未ready」，「咁我唯有做多兩年。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 譚得志（左）、陳志全（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問譚是否於整個2020年都任副主席，陳說「應該都係」，並補充於原定的立法會選舉日2020年9月6日，「佢就被捕收押到而家喇。」翻查資料，譚當天因煽動罪被捕，後因該案及初選案還柙至今。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於曾代表陳出席新東會議的蘇浩，陳指他應於2018至2021年任人力副主席，是自己其中一個議員助理，指「每個同事都係向我負責」。至於曾帶證人X出席新西會議的梁家聲，陳記得他2020至2021年是人力執委。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問何時決定參加初選-陳如搞得成初選冇乜得揀都要參與&quot;&gt;被問何時決定參加初選 陳：如搞得成初選，冇乜得揀都要參與&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問何時決定參加初選，陳志全指「好難講話邊一日」，因民主派都知道該段日子正在辦初選，「如果係傾得成嘅話，咁我哋九成都係會參加㗎喇。」陳並指在庭上才得知有2020年1月飯局，而新東4月14日首次協調會議時，「唔係100%我諗都係8、90%（打算參與初選）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問譚得志何時決定參加初選，陳指要視乎九東何時決定辦初選，又指「其實我哋都係如果個初選搞得成，都冇乜得揀㗎嘛，都要參與」，並謂「可能我哋真係太熟喇，大家都假定大家會參加，冇問你參唔參加，我參唔參加咁」，加上執委會亦有討論，故譚無在某一日向他表明會參加。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱黨內參選需決議-指不能黑箱作業幾個人圍威喂&quot;&gt;陳稱黨內參選需決議 指不能「黑箱作業」幾個人「圍威喂」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問二人參選有否黨的正式決議，陳說人民力量是一個很細的組織，「但係呢我哋啲功夫都會做嘅」，確認初選前其中一次執委會會議有公告決定，人力派他們兩人出選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指雖大家都知人民力量只有他和譚得志會參選立會，「但係我哋唔可以話黑箱作業咁，自己執委會幾個人圍威喂就話我哋出選喇咁樣」，故此前有發訊息予所有會員問有否興趣參與立選及初選，但直至5月13日執委會會議也未有人報名，故昨展示的會議紀錄提到立法會選舉「黨內初選」暫時無會員報名。陳並形容，此操作目的「就係唔好後來畀人話你哋自己決定晒啲嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱初選目的是令民主派取得最多議席-惟無大殺傷力憲制武器概念&quot;&gt;陳稱初選目的是令民主派取得最多議席 惟無「大殺傷力憲制武器」概念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問及初選目的，展示戴耀廷3月22日發布的〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉，問陳志全有否看過。陳說不記得，並主動指「你逐篇問我我真係唔記得，但我肯定我睇過『攬炒十步』嗰篇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續確認，有看過3月26日戴耀廷等人所召記者會的報導，周天行遂指戴會上提及立會過半為「大殺傷力憲制武器」，問陳是否知道35+計劃的目標就是取得「大殺傷力憲制武器」，包括否決預算案的權力。陳說「周生嘅問題不斷強調嗰個憲制性武器」，但他不記得相關報導有否引述此說法；又指他當時知道初選目的就是令民主派取得最多議席，「如果議席過半，有好多嘢都可以做到」，但並無「大殺傷力憲制武器」的概念，對此也無特別想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱否決財案並非35計劃目的-終極目的是施壓要求政府回應五大訴求&quot;&gt;陳稱否決財案並非35+計劃目的 終極目的是施壓要求政府回應五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周續問，而陳知道35+計劃的目標（objective）是要取得否決權？陳慶偉糾正指初選目標是取得過半數，並指那只是用來達到目的之手段（a means to an end），而目的包括否決預算案。惟陳志全即表示：「由始至終我都唔認同嗰個end、嗰個目的係否決財政預算案喎」。陳慶偉說：「其中一個目的」，惟陳志全再說：「嗰個唔係end、唔係目的嚟㗎喎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，那陳志全理解初選最終目的是什麼？陳回應：「最終極嘅目的咪就係贏到最多嘅議席，跟住可以畀到最大嘅壓力比政府，要佢回應，其中最主要嘅就係五大訴求囉」，並補充此整體概念並非單從記者會報導而得知。周追問，而迫使政府回應五大訴求的「目標」是否決預算案？陳慶偉糾正是「手段」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指否決是好遙遠嘅嘢選到至算&quot;&gt;陳指否決是「好遙遠嘅嘢」、「選到至算」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全回應，「你攞到過半你自然有好多權力」，其中一個權力是否決預算案，而以他的認知、理解或者相信，如民主派僥倖取得35席以上，「由開票嗰剎那，你唔講，政府都知道你有咩權力啦。」陳又強調，「唔係去到話出年嘅4、5月先至去做嘢，而係整個過程」，解釋開票後政府已要找不同陣營去傾，否決預算案只是「其中一樣嘢，而且係好遙遠嘅一樣嘢」，「即係當其時我嘅諗法就係選到至算啦！你講到上天落水都係咁話啦！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問否決財案是否迫政府回應最強大權力-陳稱建制35-連會都開唔成&quot;&gt;官問否決財案是否迫政府回應最強大權力 陳稱建制35-連「會都開唔成」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問，那陳志全認為《基本法》賦予立法會的權力中，否決預算案是迫使政府回應五大訴求的最強大（powerful）權力嗎？陳搖頭說：「概念上、理論層面上，可能好多人都以為係，但係操作層面上，其實唔係囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續着法官「畀多少少時間我，畀少少耐性」，並解釋35+下政府面對的問題，是支持政府的建制派不足35席。陳續解釋立法會法定人數為全體議員一半，即35席，故如民主派不合作湊夠法定人數，「其實單憑建制派，係連啟動會議嘅能力都冇。」陳又指，「如果建制派係35-嘅話，佢哋連法定人數都唔足夠，如果民主派唔幫手湊法定人數，根本個會都開唔成，連個財政預算案嚟立法會首讀二讀都讀唔到！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問，但若沒有否決預算案兩次，就不會造成特首下台？陳志全答：「根據嗰個《基本法》嘅條文係。」陳慶偉續向陳志全說：「我想我知道你在說什麼，你說沒有35席，立法會不能開會，故根本無需否決，因為根本不能討論預算案」，陳志全說：「係第一日都唔知開唔開到會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指情況可能是這樣，但陳仲衡意思是「特首依然會是特首」。陳志全說：「係，大家坐喺度你眼望我眼咁樣」，陳慶偉笑說不，因為沒有召開會議，「你們可能透過電視你眼望我眼」，陳笑說「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱譚得志曾告知九東會另交文件-惟無討論亦無看過內容&quot;&gt;陳稱譚得志曾告知九東會另交文件 惟無討論亦無看過內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，參選九東的譚得志提交表格時附上共同綱領，陳指曾獲譚告知九東會交多一份文件，他當時掌握不到是否叫「共同綱領」，並僅回應「我哋新東就冇喎」，而二人無討論文件內容，他亦沒問譚拿文件來看，指選舉期間二人「各自照顧自己嘅嘢」，沒有討論政綱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳在盤問下也指不知該共同綱領上的條款是九東共識。周天行問即譚沒告訴他？陳說「其實佢知唔知道我都唔知」，笑言譚有否出席九東協調會抑或由其他人代出席，「我到今日都搞唔清楚。」陳亦指，當時沒有主動問代表他出席新東會議的蘇浩，新東有否類似文件，笑指「如果有佢就話畀我知啦，冇理由有，佢唔話畀我知㗎嘛」，蘇亦已在執委會報告。陳指區諾軒亦沒有告知他新東有類似文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱不知新東協議文件-指如看過定會出聲-因新東派7席好大風險&quot;&gt;陳稱不知新東協議文件 指如看過定會出聲 因新東派7席好大風險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳盤問下續指，不知道有「民主派新界東協調機制協議」文件，而除提名表格外，亦無印象從組織者收過其他文件。陳昨供稱，理解初選共識是辦公民投票、目標議席數量、以靈童制為替補機制和辦選舉論壇4點，他今補充對當中目標議席數目也「有啲糊塗、或者唔係好清晰」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，蘇浩曾提及新東最嚴謹，他理解是目標議席為6席就派6張名單出選，惟控方展示的協議文件卻提到首7張名單可參選。陳指「如果我當其時睇到呢張嘢，我一定會出聲囉」，並指他對該4點共識「其實真係好模糊㗎，因為連議席都有個問號仔喺度㗎」。法官指文件提到目標議席6席，只是派出7張名單，陳是對出選名單數目不確定，陳同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳並指，他首次得悉可派7張名單出選，是在初選完結後，排第7的范國威也報名參加正式選舉，而他初選論壇時「冇諗過呢條問題」，因一直認為新東能獲6席已是奇蹟，「保住6席已經係個目標喇」，而派7張名單報名「真係會有好大嘅風險，係連6席都保唔到嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑陳志全早知派7張名單出選-陳可能講錯&quot;&gt;控方質疑陳志全早知派7張名單出選 陳：可能講錯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後引述陳於6月底的街站片段，提到民主動力宣布新東有12張參選名單，會從中「選出7張參與9月立法會選舉」，質疑陳當時已知道有7張名單。陳指「而家諗返可能係嗰陣時講錯囉」，指該街站是一兩個小時的街站，「我係冇稿，隨心咁揸住個咪不停不停咁講嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又強調，一直認知新東是派6張名單，重申新東取得6席已是奇蹟，「7席係接近冇可能，甚至係會有反效果」，並記得初選後他曾做訪問提到勝出的6人「拖住手一齊贏」，惟其後排第7的范國威發訊息給他說：「慢必，你咁講我唔使選啦！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳確認同意墨落兩點聲明遂簽署-理解聲明我們是指抗爭派&quot;&gt;陳確認同意「墨落」兩點聲明遂簽署 理解聲明「我們」是指抗爭派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「墨落無悔」聲明，控方問陳志全是否將自己與抗爭派連繫（associate yourself）？陳不同意。李運騰指「連繫」可有很不同的意思，若控方只是說陳認同（endorse）聲明，是並無爭議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引聲明提到戴耀廷前一日召記者會表示不會要求參選人簽署共同綱領，問陳是否知道。陳指當然他簽署時，「我有成個聲明䁽過嘅」，但他簽名就是同意聲明書中的兩點聲明，至於兩點外其他字，「其實我係冇好嚴謹咁去考究。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而對聲明中多次用「我們」，陳指「嗰啲我都係理解為佢哋嘅聲明，佢哋講嘅嘢」，即草擬聲明書的「抗爭派」，但他當時無考究誰執筆寫該聲明書。陳又指，他不肯定當時有否看畢6月9日記者會或知戴有這樣提過，但笑指「佢咁樣寫出嚟，我諗佢都唔會屈阿戴耀廷無中生有啩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指簽署墨落時無考慮是否協調會議共識&quot;&gt;陳指簽署「墨落」時無考慮是否協調會議共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「我們認為，在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎」，陳重申「共識」就是蘇浩告知他辦初選的4點共識。周天行續問，「墨落」兩點聲明與陳提到的4點共識如何相關？法官李運騰指，控方是問陳確認的4點共識並不包括「墨落」的兩點（即會運用基本法權力和支持度不足須停止選舉工程），為何仍會認同這篇聲明？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就支持度不足須停止選舉工程一點，陳指「願賭服輸」是「成個初選嘅精神嚟㗎嘛」，「應承咗如果輸就唔選，呢個係好正常嘅嘢。」陳又強調他簽署聲明是因認為該兩點「冇乜問題」，但就沒有如控方般分析，他同意的兩點「唔係所謂嘅初選協調會議共識」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指簡言之，即陳認同這份聲明，是因為他同意這兩點？陳同意。李追問，而不是因為在協調會議有協議？陳停頓了約5秒，說他能知道協調會上的事情是相當有限，「啫係如果你話最嚴謹，就係叫返蘇浩嚟問呢兩點協調會有冇傾過呀」，但他沒有這樣做，並補充他只有在不同意或對某點質疑或猶豫時，才會向蘇查詢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳重申不認為墨落綑綁否決財案-控方欲追問遭官質疑不明白證人證供&quot;&gt;陳重申不認為「墨落」綑綁否決財案 控方欲追問遭官質疑不明白證人證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳其後重申，不認為「墨落無悔」是指「贏咗選舉嘅人要一致投票去否決財政預算案」，認為聲明意思是要運用基本法賦予的權力去爭取五大訴求，而其中一樣是否決預算案的權力。周天行再問，但35+計劃的目的，不就是取得參與者共識去取得立會過半嗎？陳說：「咁『35+計劃』話明『35+』，梗係希望攞多一席得一席，就係希望攞到35+啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周再指因此他不太明白陳為何說35+計劃不是綑綁所有當選人，惟陳慶偉打斷指這是兩回事，反問「你明白他的證供嗎，周先生？」，周說他明白，他正嘗試澄清，惟陳說沒有事要澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;人力墨落配圖寫團結必須共同綱領-陳指為對民主派期望不代表已達到&quot;&gt;人力「墨落」配圖寫「團結必須共同綱領」 陳指為對民主派期望不代表已達到&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示人民力量 Facebook 有黃底黑字「團結必須 共同綱領」的配圖，問與陳昨提到的「共同政治行動綱領」是否一樣。陳解釋圖片是他和譚簽「墨落無悔」後義工製作的配圖，他理解是強調一直以來對民主派合作的期望，「如果我哋要合作、我哋要畀外界覺得我哋團結，我哋就要共同綱領囉。」陳又指以此圖作為「墨落」配圖，不代表「墨落」已達到他對共同政治行動綱領的期許，只是重申如民主派要合作要予市民團結感覺。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳確認為新東whatsapp群組成員與戴耀廷通唔夠5個訊息&quot;&gt;陳確認為新東WhatsApp群組成員、與戴耀廷通唔夠5個訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉亦一度關注，陳志全是否認識戴耀廷。陳指「叫做識啦，我諗從政嘅人個個都會認識呢個人」，並指他有戴的電話，但直至今日「夾埋通過唔夠5個 message」，他亦不知戴和蘇浩有否溝通。陳並指譚得志認識戴，亦應互相有電話，指佔中時戴曾辦很多商討日，「譚得志係比較熱衷同戴教授商討嘅。」陳另確認他是新東信息發布區群組成員，控方指陳在群組與組織者溝通，陳說：「我只能夠話我係呢個 WhatsApp 群組嘅成員囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信一方展示立會投票紀錄-指公民黨投票立場不一致&quot;&gt;李予信一方展示立會投票紀錄 指公民黨投票立場不一致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，代表李予信的大律師關文渭今早盤問陳志全時，展示2016年《醫生註冊修訂條例草案》二讀的投票紀錄，指公民黨有人投贊成、反對和棄權；至於2017年《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集修訂條例草案》，關指當時法律界不支持，而公民黨除時任法律界議員郭榮鏗投棄權，其餘議員均投贊成。陳志全確認並指類似情況「唔係少出現」，很多時功能組別不會跟大隊投票，會因業界利益而棄權或「行咗去唔投票唔表態」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭欲再展示另一投票紀錄，惟法官問及相關性。關解釋是有關鄭達鴻提到公民黨的「豁免跟隨黨立場投票機制」，望顯示直至2020年6月，公民黨仍然不一致投票。惟李運騰質疑，陳志全如何得知該些議員申請了豁免、或出現該些情況是因運用了該機制，陳慶偉亦指可能該議員是與黨爭論並主動違背黨立場。陳慶偉續問有沒有人質疑沒有豁免機制，關說沒有，陳說「正是！那問來有什麼意思？」，關說是要證人確認該紀錄，陳再問為何要他確認，關續指完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（2日）踏入審訊第97天。陳志全接受盤問，法官關注陳於2020年6月底初選街站提及「不惜」運用基本法權力，以否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求，陳強調他當時是鼓勵選民投票，或「隨口噏」。庭上續播放街站完整片段，陳志全提到以往參選如「爭獎牌」，但今時今日是「爭住去犧牲」，並指當時擺街站遭警察抄身分證，亦可能有拍片，但他說「你唔使拍我吖」，指「無論係DQ嘅罪證又好，未來呢個國安惡法嘅罪證又好，我哋都係光明正大嘅」，有被告聞言發笑。陳在街站又質疑，國安法指定法官由特首揀選，一定是選被告斬人也讚他有「高尚情操」的法官；又批評《國安法》如「強姦香港市民」之餘還要說是「性交轉運」，指香港人「最低限度都要識嗌唔好」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方問陳是否代表人民力量-官指受審是被告非人民力量&quot;&gt;控方問陳是否代表人民力量 官指受審是被告非人民力量&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續就陳志全6月底的將軍澳街站發問，指他提到「抗爭到底」，陳指是選舉口號。周天行問該口號是否陳志全、譚得志和人民力量的口號，陳笑說：「其實冇分得咁清楚，我又係人民力量，快必又係人民力量」。周指，故陳說的話代表人民力量？惟李運騰打斷周天行：「為何你對於被告是否代表人民力量這麼執着（obsessed）？最終受審的是這名被告，不是人民力量。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周續引述陳志全曾於街站提及：「今次大家搞初選，已經將個人或者黨派嘅利益係放埋一邊㗎喇，無論邊個出線邊個當選，喺未來都要同心協力抗爭到底，包括我哋之前話，不惜運用基本法賦予立法會議員嘅權力，嚟去否決財政預算案，迫使林鄭月娥政府重啟政改，回應五大訴求，達至雙普選。」周問「抗爭到底」的口號，是否包括否決預算案，迫使政府回應五大訴求？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指不同意，又稱「嗱我都預咗你會問我呢題，但你都唔可以淨係睇呢一句嘅」，並重申昨已提到在街站或宣傳片均有提及35+可做到的事，但不會講得「太過誇或者實得」，以免予選民「empty promise（空頭支票）」。陳並建議法庭留意他完整發言，指他說出上述發言後，有提及「但係今時今日似乎呢個 step 已經跳咗喇」，着選民不要太大期望，因林鄭月娥已變成「話唔到事」的「中共傀儡」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指當天街站主軸是鼓勵人投票，「對峙一啲無力感，對峙一啲覺得投票冇用、議會冇用嘅人」，強調就算達不到35+、不能令林鄭回應，初選如果有很多人出來投票，已是選民力量的展現，比起建制派指「簽咗百幾萬嘅簽名（支持《國安法》）運動」的力量「大好多」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官關注陳志全提不惜是準備好運用否決權-陳指隨口噏&quot;&gt;法官關注陳志全提「不惜」是準備好運用否決權 陳指「隨口噏」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡關注，陳志全提到「不惜」，故不只是以此作為《基本法》權力的例子，而是表示已準備好運用否決權。陳指可能現時「睇文字就好似個語氣係重啲」，並問能否回放片段，因當天「冇稿冇盛，我當時就係隨口咁樣噏出嚟」。陳仲衡指，是辯方大狀馬維騉決定不播片。陳指片段很長，他不是強烈要求法庭要立即看，也不想浪費法庭時間。惟陳慶偉指這並非浪費時間，並要求播放全長38分鐘的片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳街站指以往議員爭獎牌今時今日爭住去犧牲&quot;&gt;陳街站指以往議員「爭獎牌」、今時今日「爭住去犧牲」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續播放片段，陳志全提及香港人過去一年「變咗好多」，「返唔到轉頭」，故要「抗爭到底」，而抗爭包括街頭、網上、議會、國際和黃色經濟圈戰線，強調每一條戰線都要盡最大努力，入到議會要盡全力抗爭，與港共政權、中共抗爭到底。陳又指，以往民主派參選猶如「爭獎牌」，但今時今日是「爭住去犧牲」，「攞到嘅議席唔係話畀我哋去享受呢個議席帶嚟嘅榮耀，而係準備作出最大嘅犧牲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指國安法下初選或是投票表態最後機會&quot;&gt;陳指《國安法》下初選或是投票表態最後機會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指初選目的就是盡量減少同路人競爭，不會「鷸蚌相爭」，亦是「推動呢一場運動」。陳單張提到「儘管民間初選不盡完善，卻可能成為投票表態嘅最後機會」，解釋因「《國安法》壓境，可能都已經拉咗去坐監喇⋯⋯你未報名已經拉咗你喇」，而香港眾志的年輕人提到「初選得到越多嘅支持，係代表中共要DQ佢哋係越樣衰，但係中共真係唔怕樣衰呀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到被問是否怕DQ，「我就話冇得怕㗎，因為把刀喺中共嘅手上，喺港共嘅手上」，並形容政府2016年引入的參選人「確認書」為「僭建物」，指若政府要求簽署支持《國安法》，「我覺得所有民主派嘅朋友唔應該簽，因為咁樣係背叛香港人，係背叛呢場運動。」陳又指，已作最壞打算未必能參選，因可能所有現任民主派議員也會被DQ、「全部民主派冇得入閘」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指國安惡法強姦香港市民之餘還要說性交轉運&quot;&gt;陳指國安惡法強姦香港市民之餘還要說「性交轉運」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦談及對司法制度和《國安法》看法，指就張舉能委任首席法官議案投反對票，「唔好再畀個假象大家睇話香港有咩嘢司法獨立呀，我哋要尊重法庭嘅司法系統。」陳又形容現時中共推「國安惡法」，「可以架空我哋法庭」，甚至「拎返去北京審都仲得」，而法官由林鄭月娥揀選，「佢會揀一啲咩嘢法官呢？梗係揀啲有高尚情操嗰啲法官喇，即係斬人都有高尚情操嘅法官⋯⋯呢啲仲係咪我哋以前香港所謂嘅司法獨立？」三名法官聞言時面無表情，繼續觀看電腦螢幕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，當局「將國安惡法講成好似香港嘅救命護身符」，是「守護神」、「中共送畀香港嘅大禮」，但「我就要踢爆佢國安法唔單止唔係一啲好嘢，簡直係要強姦香港市民，喺強姦香港市民之餘，仲要話呢個係性交轉運喎……仲話對你好呀，係對香港好呀，立咗國安惡法呢就繁榮穩定喇、長久至遠喇」，「我哋覺得中共而家係咁同香港人攬炒。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，香港如步入文革時代、以言入罪，「如果香港人唔反抗，係逆來順受，即係佢強姦你，你話哦，好舒服呀咁樣，咁樣冇人可以幫到我哋㗎」，「所以香港人，最低限度都要識嗌唔好。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指街站遭拍片如成國安法罪證也光明正大&quot;&gt;陳指街站遭拍片如成《國安法》罪證也「光明正大」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，「未來呢場抗爭運動，我哋唔知道我仲可以行幾遠，可能聽日佢就拉咗我」，並指剛才開街站被一班警察圍住，「我從來都未試過候選人或者議員呢要抄身份證嘅」，但還是遭抄身分證，又被要求拍攝單張相片，「可能亦都係拍低晒我哋講咩嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指「我話成份（單張）畀你，畀多幾份你都得啦，啊警察，係咪呀」，又說「你唔使拍我吖，我而家 Facebook Live 緊嘅，你上我網咁咪睇得晒囉，我講乜嘢你覺得係罪證，無論係DQ嘅罪證又好，未來呢個國安惡法嘅罪證又好，我哋都係光明正大嘅」，林卓廷、鄒家成等聞言發笑，旁聽席亦傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到，「抗爭到底」的意思是「咬住唔放」，「邊個可以咬住唔放呢，邊個就係最尾有機會贏」，「對啲保皇黨如此，對林鄭政府如此，對共產黨亦都如此。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播畢片段後，法官下令休庭，案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Political warfare is the employment of all the means at a nation’s command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An ambitious blueprint has been drawn for building a modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization, sounding a clarion call of the times for us forging ahead on a new journey.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-xi-jinping&quot;&gt;– Xi Jinping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;China is conducting an unprecedented campaign below the threshold of armed conflict to expand the influence of the Chinese Communist Party and weaken the United States and its partners.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This campaign involves sophisticated Chinese espionage activities, offensive cyber operations, disinformation on social media platforms, economic coercion, and influence operations targeting companies, universities, and other organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report offers one of the most comprehensive analyses to date of Chinese political warfare activities and examines China’s main actions, primary goals, and options for the United States and its partners. It sheds new light on the scope and breadth of Chinese activities and comes to several conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, China is conducting an increasingly active and aggressive campaign to penetrate a wide range of U.S. academic institutions, companies, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The scale of China’s actions in the United States is unparalleled. As one Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) senior official told the authors, “The system is blinking red right now. We have not seen this level of Chinese intelligence and influence activity in and around the U.S. homeland ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, for example, the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) have arrested or indicted numerous individuals for espionage, cyber operations, and illegal influence campaigns. The list includes an indictment against the codirector of a U.S.-based think tank for acting as an unregistered foreign agent for China and other actions, a series of aggressive cyberattacks against senior U.S. government officials and companies such as Microsoft, and the expansion of Chinese intelligence collection sites in such countries as Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, China has been involved in an expansive campaign to monitor, harass, and coerce residents of the United States and other countries as part of an extralegal repatriation effort known as Operation Fox Hunt. In 2023, for example, the FBI arrested two individuals, “Harry” Lu Jianwang and Chen Jinping, in connection with operating an illegal police station in Manhattan, New York City, for China’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS). In 2023, DOJ also indicted dozens of MPS officials for conducing online intimidation against Chinese nationals residing in the United States who were critical of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the report details that China’s top target for political warfare — by far — is the United States. Chinese actions against the United States are more expansive than is generally known and include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s intelligence services, such as the Ministry of State Security (MSS) and MPS, are engaged in extensive human intelligence, signals intelligence, and other types of intelligence collection as part of political warfare — including intimidating Chinese diaspora in the United States. In examining over 100 Chinese espionage cases directed at the United States and U.S. entities, this report concludes that Chinese intelligence operations are not just pervasive, but they are used to plan and execute all of China’s other political warfare activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese organizations, including units within the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), are involved in a cyber campaign against U.S. and other international corporations, universities, government agencies, media, think tanks, nongovernmental organizations, and other targets. These efforts are designed to help China leapfrog ahead of the West by skipping the extensive and time-consuming research and development phases for new technologies. China’s cyber operations are also intended to influence foreign and domestic audiences, assist with offensive military campaigns, and improve the country’s artificial intelligence and big data analytics capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information and Disinformation Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; China is engaged in extensive  information and disinformation activities overseas — including in the U.S. homeland — designed to influence decisionmaking and popular support to gain a competitive advantage. Beijing seeks to tightly control the image of China abroad, including by influencing companies, organizations, and individuals that criticize China, from the National Basketball Association to Hollywood studios.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United Front Work:&lt;/strong&gt; The CCP is involved in aggressive efforts to extend its reach overseas through united front work, which involves activity to protect and bolster the image of China and the CCP. United front work includes activities to influence individuals in such countries as the United States who are well positioned to amplify China’s preferred messaging on political, economic, and other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular Military Actions:&lt;/strong&gt; The PLA, PLA Navy, PLA Air Force, PLA Rocket Forces, People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia, research organizations, and private security companies linked to China are involved in widespread efforts to expand Chinese influence below the threshold of armed conflict. Chinese organizations are involved in near-seas activities (which focus on securing Chinese interests around such areas as the South and East China Seas) and farseas activities (which are global in scope). This report constructs a dataset of Chinese private security companies that shows that there are nearly two dozen Chinese private security companies operating overseas, including in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Coercion:&lt;/strong&gt; China has penetrated — or attempted to penetrate — virtually every sector of the U.S. economy, as well as many of its partners such as the United Kingdom. In addition, China is engaged in the threat or imposition of economic costs or inducements to influence decisionmaking and popular support in other countries to gain a competitive advantage. There has been considerable focus on the Belt and Road Initiative as part of a broader effort to influence foreign governments. As this report highlights, however, another concerning Chinese initiative is the Digital Silk Road, which aims to spread Chinese influence through telecommunications, e-commerce, hardware, software, big data, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and other digital infrastructure across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools are part of a broad strategy of &lt;em&gt;political warfare&lt;/em&gt;, which U.S. diplomat George Kennan described as “the employment of all the means at a nation’s command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives.” The U.S. public and other international audiences are often unaware of the full nature and scope of these Chinese activities, including those that target U.S. and other Western companies, government agencies, universities, news media, digital platforms, and other NGOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools are not mutually exclusive but are sometimes overlapping, reinforcing, and occasionally even duplicative and competitive. China presents a “whole-of-state” approach to political warfare. Multiple organizations are involved, such as the PLA, MSS, MPS, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, United Front Work Department, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A wide range of non-state or quasi-state actors are also involved, from hacktivists to private security companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, China has several strategic goals in conducting political warfare. The most important is preservation of the CCP’s rule. Another is expanding Chinese influence and weakening the United States as part of balance-of-power competition. These goals are in line with China’s national strategy of achieving “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts.” China also conducts political warfare — rather than armed conflict — to avoid conventional war and refrain from provoking other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these activities, the United States and its partners have been slow to identify and counter Chinese political warfare. This needs to change. Moving forward, there are several core components of an effective strategy to compete with China. These components include continuing to ground U.S. responses in democratic principles; improving the United States’ understanding of China through a more systematic analysis of the country; improving defensive measures, including increasing U.S. counterintelligence resources; conducting a more effective offensive campaign; and deepening relationships with partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. policymakers have been more comfortable with defensive measures to protect the United States from Chinese intelligence operations, cyber operations, propaganda, united front work, and other activity. But U.S. and partner offensive measures are also essential to help achieve several goals, such as reversing China’s expansionism and influence by competing on a sustained basis across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the Cold War, Kennan authored a U.S. State Department Policy Planning Staff memorandum on political warfare that remains relevant to today’s competition with China. He noted that a significant part of great power competition involves activities below the threshold of conventional and nuclear warfare. Today, China is heavily involved in many of these activities. As this report documents, China also has significant weaknesses and vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Together with its partners, the United States now needs to develop a comprehensive approach to compete in this arena that is consistent with its democratic principles and values. The clock is ticking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Confronted with drastic changes in the international landscape, especially external attempts to blackmail, contain, blockade, and exert maximum pressure on China, we have put our national interests first, focused on internal political concerns, and maintained firm strategic resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-xi-jinping-1&quot;&gt;– Xi Jinping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This report examines Chinese political warfare, which includes actions below the threshold of conventional warfare designed to achieve a state’s national objectives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Examples include intelligence operations, cyber operations, information and disinformation operations, united front work, irregular military action, and economic coercion. These measures have also been referred to as gray zone actions, irregular warfare, asymmetric activities, or even unrestricted warfare. An analysis of political warfare is essential for two main reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, much of the U.S. focus on China has been on the growing conventional or nuclear capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and other organizations. As one report from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) concludes, the PLA is “developing the capabilities to conduct joint long-range precision strikes across domains, increasingly sophisticated space, counterspace, and cyber capabilities, and accelerating the large-scale expansion of its nuclear forces.” Based on these concerns, the United States has concentrated on building conventional and nuclear capabilities to deter China with the help of its partners — and to fight China if deterrence fails. The United States’ 2022 &lt;em&gt;National Defense Strategy&lt;/em&gt; focuses on the conventional and nuclear threat from China and ways that the United States and its partners could sustain and strengthen conventional and nuclear deterrence. In addition, the majority of DOD planning scenarios and operational plans (OPLANs) center on conventional war with China. The same is true with wargames over the past few years, which have focused on such scenarios as a Chinese conventional invasion of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actions are necessary. The United States and its partners need to continue developing military capabilities for deterrence and — if deterrence fails — warfighting. But these measures are not sufficient. As this report finds, Beijing is conducting a wide range of activities below the level of armed conflict designed to protect the CCP, weaken the United States and its allies, and expand Chinese power and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there is a growing body of work on Chinese political warfare and related activities. But most assessments have been relatively narrow and focused on one of the following areas: PLA gray zone activities, especially by the PLA Navy, PLA Air Force, PLA Army, People’s Armed Police, China Coast Guard, and People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia; cyber and disinformation operations, including activity by the PLA Strategic Support Force; or intelligence operations, including activity by the MSS and MPS. For example, there has been a great deal of research and analysis on Chinese gray zone activity, particularly actions by the PLA. Yet most of this work has focused on military actions by the PLA — not broader political warfare by a range of Chinese organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disaggregating Chinese political warfare into various parts — and not analyzing the sum of its parts — misses China’s broad and systematic attempts to expand power and influence across multiple areas. Chinese political warfare cannot be fully understood piecemeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research-design&quot;&gt;RESEARCH DESIGN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report asks several questions. What actions is China conducting against the United States and its partners as part of political warfare? What are China’s main goals in conducting political warfare? Finally, what options do the United States and its partners have to counter these Chinese activities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, this report applies a mixed-methods approach. It compiles quantitative data on several issues — such as counterintelligence cases, cyber incidents, and Chinese private security companies — to better understand Chinese political warfare and assess trends over time. For example, the chapter on intelligence operations reviews more than 100 U.S. indictments of individuals accused of conducting activities on behalf of China. The chapter on Chinese irregular military activities constructs a database of Chinese private security companies that have operated outside of China, sample locations in which they are reported to operate, the types of services they have provided, and some of their known clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the report utilizes several types of qualitative information to better understand Chinese political warfare. Members of the research team collected and analyzed Chinese documents, including documents from CSIS’s open-source project, &lt;em&gt;Interpret: China&lt;/em&gt;. The chapter on information and disinformation relies on a body of English-language primary source speeches from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the CSIS &lt;em&gt;Interpret: China&lt;/em&gt; database. The CSIS team also scraped and analyzed the tweets of prominent Chinese Communist Party (CCP) spokespersons. Furthermore, the intelligence chapter analyzes one of the few unclassified Chinese-language documents illuminating China’s approach to intelligence: a book by two Chinese intelligence veterans, Huo Zhongwen and Wang Zongxiao. The chapter on irregular military activities relies on a variety of primary and secondary sources, including Chinese research publications, government white papers, press releases, and speeches by officials; analysis and data reported by U.S. and partner governments and research institutions; and satellite imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, CSIS analysts conducted interviews with U.S. government officials, academic and corporate subject matter experts, and officials from several foreign countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-warfare&quot;&gt;POLITICAL WARFARE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As used in this report, political warfare refers to activities short of conventional and nuclear warfare that are designed to expand a country’s influence and legitimacy, as well as weaken its adversaries. Political warfare is not new. As historian Hal Brands concludes, “During the Peloponnesian War, Athens and Sparta sought to widen each other’s internal divisions. During the Cold War, it would have been odd had America not waged political warfare against the Kremlin, since the nuclear revolution made it so essential to win without violence.” The Soviet Union and United States utilized political warfare during the Cold War to achieve several goals: weaken a population’s trust in its institutions of government (whether in the United States, the Soviet Union, or their allied countries), establish or widen cleavages between individuals and groups in society, and establish or exploit divisions between allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, political warfare includes tools of statecraft that governments can use to shift the balance of power in their favor without fighting each other directly, such as disinformation, cyber operations, intelligence operations, and economic coercion. Political warfare is designed to strengthen a state and weaken its adversaries by sowing or exploiting internal divisions, creating schisms within and among its partners, and draining its resources and energy. Other government officials and scholars have used different terms — such as irregular warfare, hybrid warfare, gray zone activity, asymmetric conflict, and the indirect approach — to capture some or all of these activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As U.S. State Department diplomat George Kennan observed, “Political warfare is the logical application of Clausewitz’s doctrine in times of peace” — that is, in the absence of direct armed conflict. “Such operations are both overt and covert,” Kennan explained. “They range from such overt actions as political alliances, economic measures [such as the Marshall Plan during the Cold War], and ‘white’ propaganda to such covert operations as clandestine support of ‘friendly’ foreign elements, ‘black’ psychological warfare and even encouragement of underground resistance in hostile states.” As Kennan argued, the creation and survival of the British Empire and the Soviet Union were in part caused by their effective application of political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political warfare involves actions that impact the cost-benefit calculations of states and their populations without resorting to brute force, which can often have high costs in blood and treasure. Political warfare can include several components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; The practice of obtaining political, military, economic, and other intelligence to coerce or otherwise gain a competitive advantage over an adversary. For the purpose of political warfare, these intelligence activities are more than just routine espionage since they are designed to weaken adversaries below the level of armed conflict. In addition, intelligence collection plays a critical role in informing and supporting all other components of political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Actions taken through unauthorized access to computer networks to coerce or otherwise gain a competitive advantage over an adversary, ranging from denial of service to disruption and confusion, to physical, real-world effects like destruction of equipment through penetration of an industrial control system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information and Disinformation Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; The collection and dissemination of information to influence decisionmaking or popular support. As highlighted in Chapter 6, China has also used a specific type of influence operation, termed “united front work,” to gather information on, manage relations with, and attempt to influence individuals inside and outside of China — including individuals in overseas communities that hold political, economic, or academic influence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular Military Actions:&lt;/strong&gt; Activities taken by military forces — or units directly or indirectly linked to military forces — to coerce or otherwise gain a competitive advantage over an adversary below the threshold of armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Coercion:&lt;/strong&gt; The threat or actual imposition of economic costs or inducements on a target to influence decisionmaking or popular support and to gain a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political warfare is distinct from conventional warfare, which has sometimes been referred to as “regular” warfare. Conventional warfare involves the direct use of army, navy, air force, and other military capabilities to defeat an adversary’s armed forces on a battlefield; control territory, populations, and forces; or annihilate an enemy’s war-making capacity. Political warfare is also different from nuclear warfare, which involves the use of — or threat to use — nuclear weapons against adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might object that the concept of political warfare can include almost anything a state does below the threshold of armed conflict. But this would be incorrect. The vast majority of state activity overseas — such as routine diplomacy, development work, humanitarian assistance, and trade — are not examples of political warfare. States engage in numerous other actions that have nothing to do with political warfare, such as public financial management, infrastructure construction, asset management, market engagement, rule of law, and governance. What pushes an activity into the arena of political warfare is when its goal is to expand a country’s power and weaken its adversaries as part of balance-of-power competition. Political warfare is &lt;em&gt;power politics short of conventional war&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might also be uncomfortable with using the term “warfare” to describe nonviolent actions such as economic coercion and information operations. But that is not how countries such as China see it. They apply a broad view of warfare as a struggle between competing entities and not just the use of brute force. China has used terms such as the “three warfares” (三战), which includes media, psychological, and legal warfare. None of the three warfares involves the use of violence. As the Chinese general Sun Tzu remarked, the supreme art of war is to “subdue the enemy &lt;em&gt;without fighting&lt;/em&gt;.” Other countries have also conceptualized warfare as including nonviolent actions. For example, Iran has utilized terms such as &lt;em&gt;jang-e narm&lt;/em&gt; (soft war), which includes such activities as propaganda and disinformation to influence others. Likewise, Russia has used terms such as &lt;em&gt;aktivnyye meropriyatiya&lt;/em&gt; (active measures) as a tool of warfare against the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political nature of political warfare is a critical component because states can use a range of tools below the threshold of armed conflict to influence, deter, or coerce others. Chinese activities are particularly well suited for examining the concept of political warfare because of the ubiquitous role of the CCP, a political party, in society. The party has only strengthened under President and General Secretary Xi Jinping. As China expert Jude Blanchette contends, “Xi is surrounded by advisers who think primarily in political, not military terms.” The result has been that political warfare is an important component of China’s tool kit. “Chinese military planners began to focus on ‘informationalization’ of the PLA,” notes David Kilcullen, “bringing it into the modern digital era and renewing their emphasis on political warfare.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All countries — or at least all aspiring powers — utilize political warfare. But the Chinese practice of political warfare is different from many other countries in several respects. First is its size and scope. A much larger component of the Chinese government is engaged in political warfare than is typical of historical cases, and Chinese organizations are involved in a wide range of activities. During the Cold War, for instance, U.S. special operations forces and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were primarily engaged in political warfare for the United States, while the KGB was the main actor for the Soviet Union. But China has leveraged the PLA, MSS, MPS, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, United Front Work Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other agencies. Second, China is heavily engaged in co-opting, attempting to co-opt, and coercing Chinese diaspora populations overseas. This has led to a growth in extraterritorial activity — such as the establishment of so-called police stations overseas — to monitor, co-opt, and even harass Chinese citizens. Third, China under Xi Jinping is unusually concerned about protecting its image overseas and countering criticism from a wide range of actors, such as educational institutions, corporations, research organizations, media (including social media), and governments. This paranoia may be partly a desire to preserve the CCP’s rule — and indeed Xi Jinping’s legacy — and to prevent domestic opposition and instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;caveats&quot;&gt;CAVEATS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several limitations of this research. First, there are notable challenges in understanding China’s intentions, capabilities, and actions. China — including such organizations as the PLA — is opaque. China translates a limited amount of information into English. Western governments and academics have failed to translate into English and make publicly available some of China’s most important military documents, speeches, and reports. Most Americans have to rely on what the CCP chooses to translate into English using state-run media and propaganda outlets. In addition, the Chinese system is structured in such a way that there is tremendous secrecy about the role that senior officials play and the mechanisms of government. To deal with these challenges, this report qualifies its judgments based on analyzing the available evidence, sourcing information, and highlighting information gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, some Chinese political warfare activities are designed to be clandestine, making it difficult to assess what the Chinese government is doing, either directly or indirectly through proxies or partners. These proxies and partners can include front organizations, hackers, private security companies, fishing vessels, media organizations, spies, non-governmental institutions, and others. Because of the clandestine nature of some aspects of political warfare, it is sometimes impossible to know with certainty whether and how the Chinese government was involved. Again, this report has tried to qualify its judgments and document its primary and secondary sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, this report relies on unclassified and open-source information. Even classified assessments that use signals intelligence, human intelligence, satellite intelligence, and other types of intelligence face information hurdles and gaps in knowledge. A reliance on open-source information presents even greater hurdles. Nevertheless, taking pre-cautionary steps — such as qualifying judgments where appropriate and identifying gaps in information — still leads to a useful understanding of Chinese political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, this report is still able to compile a useful overview and understanding of Chinese political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-of-the-report&quot;&gt;OVERVIEW OF THE REPORT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this report is divided into the following chapters to better understand Chinese political warfare. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the strategic logic of Chinese political warfare. Chapter 3 analyzes Chinese intelligence operations, which are important to all other aspects of political warfare. Chapter 4 focuses on Chinese cyber operations, including offensive cyber activities. Chapter 5 examines Chinese influence efforts, including information and disinformation operations. Chapter 6 explores united front work. Chapter 7 examines China’s irregular military actions, including using such means as fishing vessels, the People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia, and private security companies. Chapter 8 explores Beijing’s global economic coercion. Finally, Chapter 9 outlines how the United States and its partners can better counter Chinese political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-strategic-logic-of-chinese-political-warfare&quot;&gt;THE STRATEGIC LOGIC OF CHINESE POLITICAL WARFARE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sino-U.S. relations already cannot return to their former state. In response to the United States’ multi-pronged attack and wide-ranging suppression, China must consider and formulate long-term and strategic response strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-ni-guihua-and-zhu-feng&quot;&gt;– Ni Guihua and Zhu Feng&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;China has a long history of political warfare.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Between the third and fifth centuries BC, for example, Wu Qi, Sima Rangju, Sun Bin, Sun Tzu, and others were influential in the art of covert and clandestine activities. More recently, an assessment by two People’s Liberation Army (PLA) officers concluded that the “use of asymmetrical measures, which create power for oneself and make the situation develop as you want it to, is often hugely effective.” This chapter provides an overview of Chinese political warfare. It asks two sets of questions: What are China’s main goals in conducting political warfare, and how does China conceptualize the use of these activities? What are the primary organizations involved in political warfare? To answer these questions, the chapter examines Chinese and other primary and secondary sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter makes two main arguments. First, China has several strategic goals in conducting political warfare. One set of goals is preserving the CCP, expanding Chinese power and influence, and weakening adversaries as part of balance-of-power competition. In addition, China aims to compete with the United States and other countries while avoiding conventional war and limiting security fears that might come from conventional military activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, numerous Chinese institutions are involved in political warfare, such as the PLA, Ministry of State Security, Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, United Front Work Department, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. There are also a wide range of non-state entities involved in political warfare, such as hacktivist organizations, member of the Chinese diaspora, and private security companies. While the Chinese government attempts to establish a whole-of-nation approach to domestic and international security, there is neither one clear strategic concept for political warfare nor one lead agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two arguments suggest a complex bureaucratic structure of concepts, agencies, and actions involved in planning and executing political warfare. In some areas, such as intelligence operations and united front work, there is likely more centralization through the Ministry of State Security and United Front Work Department, respectively. But these activities are not always well synchronized. As the U.S. commander of the Office of Naval Intelligence assessed, “We have strong indications that Xi Jinping . . . is not aware of everything his security forces are doing. We think it’s a function of the unwieldiness of China’s governance model.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter is divided into four sections. The first examines Chinese strategic goals in using political warfare. The second discusses major Chinese concepts for political warfare, which include a mix of military, economic, ideological, and other efforts designed to gain a competitive advantage. The third section describes the main organizations involved in Chinese political warfare. And the fourth provides a brief conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-goals&quot;&gt;STRATEGIC GOALS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In utilizing political warfare, Chinese leaders likely have several goals that are interlinked. If implemented effectively, they can maximize benefits (such as expanding power and influence) and minimize risks (such as triggering security concerns and a balancing coalition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, China utilizes political warfare to preserve the CCP’s rule, expand Chinese power and influence, and weaken its adversaries — especially the United States. These goals are in line with China’s national strategy of achieving “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts.” Chinese leaders view the international security environment as increasingly hostile and the United States as a major competitor. “The Central Committee has brought together the entire Party, the military, and the Chinese people and led them in effectively responding to grave, intricate international developments and a series of immense risks and challenges,” Xi noted in his report to the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of “strategic advantage” (势 or shi) has long been an important aspect of Chinese strategic thinking and an influential component of military, diplomatic, intelligence, and other actions. Under shi, a state seeks a relative advantage over its opponent, no matter how slight. In this approach, shi is a dynamic — rather than fixed — concept and may evolve as the balance of power changes. As the Chinese scholar Zhongqi Pan argued: “What China fights for is not just national interests, but relative advantage in shi. . . . In terms of the strategic goal, China aims to build, accumulate and maintain a relative advantage of shi vis-à-vis other countries including the U.S. at regional level, and probably at global level as well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding Chinese power is part of Xi Jinping’s desire for a “great national rejuvenation” and for the PLA to become a world-class military by 2049. For Xi and other officials, the process of rejuvenation is in part a process of competition with its chief rival, the United States. This competition may not occur primarily on a conventional battlefield but rather in the economic, technological, informational, and diplomatic spheres. In the 20th National Congress report, Xi tasked the PLA with achieving the same three-stage military modernization plan (including a range of targets for 2027, 2035, and 2049) that has been in place since 2020. Part of China’s focus is maintaining a favorable external environment, including in the Indo-Pacific, in which countries align with and acquiesce to China’s policies and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China likely utilizes political warfare to limit provoking other countries. The tools of political warfare are critical for expanding Chinese power and influence without triggering major pushback — including causing a conventional war or, at the very least, prompting an adversary to establish a balancing coalition. The desire to prevent a balancing coalition has a long tradition in balance-of-power politics. The growing strength and potential threat of a rising power have historically led one or more states to balance against the emerging power. Balancing states can increase their own economic and military power (internal balancing) or band together with a coalition of countries (external balancing). Military conquest by the rising power invariably causes fear among neighboring states and potential challengers. But it is less clear that political warfare elicits the same type of security concerns. As Bonny Lin argues in her analysis of Chinese gray zone actions, “These international tactics offer China more indirect and, in some cases, less visible and seemingly legitimate ways to pressure countries that could invite less regional or international criticism and pushback.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, China likely pursues political warfare in a competitive environment to increase its power and minimize potential opposition. These activities are part of the broader goals of China’s rejuvenation by increasing military, economic, technological, political, and other forms of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-concepts&quot;&gt;KEY CONCEPTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve these goals, there are several concepts that China uses to capture aspects of political warfare. Table 2.1 highlights some of the key concepts, from strategic advantage (势) to military operations other than war (非战争军事行动).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of China’s most frequently used terms is military operations other than war (非战争军事行动, or MOOTW). For example, the 2020 edition of The Science of Military Strategy, published by the PLA’s National Defense University, includes a comprehensive chapter on MOOTW, which it defines as “non-war military operations carried out by a country or political group to achieve a certain political goal.” The PLA’s dictionary of military terms similarly defines MOOTW as “the armed forces’ use of military operations to protect national security and development interests that do not directly lead to war.” MOOTW has generally included stability operations, maritime rights enforcement, and other actions designed to expand Chinese influence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;concepts-relevant-to-political-warfare&quot;&gt;Concepts Relevant to Political Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asymmetric Means&lt;/strong&gt; (非对称): Use irregular means against an adversary, such as cyber warfare.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gray Zone&lt;/strong&gt; (灰色地带):Perform irregular military and other activity, including clandestine actions by Western countries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid Warfare&lt;/strong&gt; (混合战争): Orchestrate a mixture of conventional and irregular activity to achieve political objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Military Operations Other Than War&lt;/strong&gt;(非战争军事行动): Conduct non-war military operations to achieve a certain political goal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overseas Strategic Strong Points&lt;/strong&gt; (海外战略支点): Establish Chinese-operated ports abroad, such as seaports, using diplomatic and other means to provide easier and more cost-effective means of conducting military operations than working with a foreign port authority or commercial entity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peacetime Employment of Military Force&lt;/strong&gt; (和平时期军事力量运用): Conduct military activities to deter or coerce an adversary that poses a threat — but without resorting to conventional war.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Advantage&lt;/strong&gt; (势): Gain a relative advantage over the opponent, no matter how slight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Struggle&lt;/strong&gt; (斗争): Strive through violent or non-violent means to resolve what Marxist-Leninists deem to be “contradictions” in domestic and international society.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Warfares&lt;/strong&gt; (三战): Create an information advantage through public opinion warfare (舆论战), psychological warfare (心理战), and legal warfare (法律战).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United Front&lt;/strong&gt; (统战): Protect and bolster the image of China and the CCP, including by monitoring and countering criticism overseas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, the CCP’s Central Committee and the Central Military Commission approved an important concept for the PLA called the “three warfares” (三战). It includes three components: public opinion warfare (舆论战), psychological warfare (心理战), and legal warfare (法律战). Building on Mao Zedong’s contention that the military’s goal is to carry out “the political tasks of the revolution,” the three warfares offer a way for the PLA to establish and expand Chinese political power and influence at home and abroad without resorting to armed conflict. In this sense, the PLA is not a national military but rather the armed wing of the CCP, which defends the political power of the CCP. The components of the three warfares are intended to be reinforcing rather than mutually exclusive. Together, they are designed to help China wage information warfare against the United States and other competitors across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first component, media warfare, involves the use of broadcast, print, and online efforts to influence domestic and international public opinion in ways that support Chinese interests and undermine its competitors. China recognizes that newspapers, television, radio, social media, and even organizations such as civilian institutions are all legitimate mediums to influence populations. Overseas, China has waged media warfare through broadcasts of the state-run China Central Television (CCTV) and China Global Television Network (CGTN), inserts paid for by the Chinese government in newspapers such as the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and educational institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second component, psychological warfare, is designed to sow dissent, disaffection, and discord among soldiers and the civilian population of competitors such as the United States. Psychological warfare also leverages television, radio broadcasts, leaflets, and other mediums — much like media warfare — but it is designed to achieve military purposes. As one analysis in the PLA journal &lt;em&gt;China Military Science&lt;/em&gt; concluded, the goal of psychological warfare should be to “sap the enemy’s morale, disintegrate their will to fight, ignite the anti-war sentiment among citizens at home, heighten international and domestic conflict, weaken and sway the will to fight among its high-level decision makers, and in turn lessen their superiority in military strength.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third component, legal warfare, involves the exploitation of international and domestic law to assert the legitimacy of Chinese claims. &lt;em&gt;The Science of Military Strategy&lt;/em&gt; argued that for the PLA, “international law is a powerful weapon to expose the enemy, win over sympathy and support of the international community [for China], and to strive to gain the position of strategic initiative.” It went on to explain that China needed to publicize its “own humanitarianism and reveal a lot of the war crimes committed by the opponent in violation of law . . . to compel [the] opponent to bog down in isolation and passivity.” Influential Chinese military texts emphasize that the PLA should justify its military actions through legal means before beginning any conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Chinese leaders and experts have utilized other concepts to describe elements of political warfare, which are highlighted in Figure 2.1. These include asymmetric means (非对称), civil-military fusion (军民融合), cognitive domain operations (认知域作战), discursive power (话语权), discourse war (话语战), economic diplomacy (经济外交), gray zone (灰色地带), hybrid warfare (混合战争), overseas strategic strong points (海外战略支点), peacetime employment of military force (和平时期军事力量运用), strategic advantage (势), struggle (斗争), and united front (统战). China has also utilized such notions as the “holistic security concept” (整体安全概念) to expand the definition of security at home and abroad to include nearly a dozen fields, including political, territorial, military, economic, cultural, social, scientific and technological, information, ecological, financial, and nuclear security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;main-organizations&quot;&gt;MAIN ORGANIZATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several organizations involved in spearheading political warfare, such as the PLA, Ministry of State Security, Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, United Front Work Department, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As this report highlights, there are also nongovernment actors — from hacktivists to private security companies and Chinese citizens — involved in political warfare. Figure 2.2 highlights some of the most important state organizations and examples of their activities. While the Chinese government — especially the CCP — attempts to establish a whole-of-nation approach, there is no single, centralized organization involved in all of these political warfare activities. Instead, there are multiple overlapping entities that span the military, economic, political, ideological, intelligence, law enforcement, and other realms. As this section notes, there are a range of non-state actors — from fishing vessels to hackers — that are also involved in political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA is involved in a range of political warfare activities in addition to preparing for conventional and nuclear war and deterrence. The PLA sits under the broader command and control of the Central Military Commission, which is China and the CCP’s main national defense organization and is chaired by Xi Jinping. The PLA Navy (PLAN), PLA Air Force (PLAAF), PLA Army (PLAA), PLA Rocket Force (PLARF), and other organizations play important roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLAN, for example, has been involved in harassing and disrupting commercial activities in disputed territories as well as sailing into contested territory in the East China Sea, Senkaku Islands, Thitu Island, and other areas. The PLAAF has conducted air operations — including with unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) — in disputed territories and harassed specific commercial activities, including around the Spratly Islands, the Taiwan Strait, and other locations. The PLAA and PLARF have also conducted political warfare activities against such countries as India, including around the disputed China-India border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the People’s Armed Police (PAP) and the China Coast Guard (CCG) have been involved in political warfare activities. The PAP is a paramilitary force within China’s armed forces charged with maritime security and internal security. The CCG, which is subordinate to the PAP, is responsible for a broad range of maritime security missions and has as many as 1,040 regional and oceangoing patrol vessels. The People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM), which is a subset of China’s national militia, is involved in protecting maritime claims, conducting surveillance and reconnaissance, protecting fisheries, and conducting search and rescue missions. It is also involved in political warfare, especially to advance China’s disputed sovereignty claims in such areas as the South and East China Seas. These Chinese organizations have also leveraged non-state actors, including those involved in fishing. Mao Zedong argued that the PLA needed to leverage fishermen as an important component of competition, stating “The navy must also rely on the people; it must rely on fishermen. It must plant roots among the fishermen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China Coast Guard&lt;/strong&gt; Conducts maritime operations, including around disputed territory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia&lt;/strong&gt; Conducts maritime operations, including around disputed territory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People’s Armed Police&lt;/strong&gt; Conducts internal security, riot control, disaster response, and maritime rights protection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA Air Force&lt;/strong&gt; Conducts air operations — including with unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) — in disputed territories and harasses specific commercial activities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA Army&lt;/strong&gt; Orchestrates land-based operations to collect intelligence and conduct subversive activities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA Navy&lt;/strong&gt; Harasses and disrupts specific commercial activities in disputed territories and sails into contested territory in the East China Sea, Senkaku Islands, and other areas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA Rocket Force&lt;/strong&gt; Orchestrates land-based operations to collect intelligence and conduct subversive activities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA Strategic Support Force&lt;/strong&gt; Conducts offensive cyber operations, intelligence collection, and information operations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/strong&gt; Orchestrates information, disinformation, and misinformation activity and engages in subversive efforts to expand Chinese influence and power.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ministry of Industry and Information Technology&lt;/strong&gt; Oversees China’s network infrastructure and coordinates with technology companies and universities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ministry of Public Security&lt;/strong&gt; Monitors dissidents and foreigners, particularly those located within China.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ministry of State Security&lt;/strong&gt; Conducts intelligence operations (including against members of the Chinese diaspora) through human intelligence, signals intelligence, and other means; oversees counterintelligence; conducts cyber operations, including offensive cyber operations; and orchestrates a range of subversive activity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United Front Work Department&lt;/strong&gt; Conducts information, disinformation, and misinformation activity to protect and bolster the image of China and the CCP, including by pressuring individuals and organizations overseas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA has also been involved in influence operations through the Strategic Support Force (SSF), a theater-level organization established to centralize the PLA’s space, cyber, electronic, information, communications, and psychological warfare missions. The SSF combines technology and information systems into an organization that is critical for offensive cyber operations as well as intelligence gathering and technical reconnaissance. As part of its modernization effort, the PLA consolidated previously decentralized cyber units into the SSF beginning in late 2015 and throughout 2016 to improve the PLA’s combat capabilities. This effort was designed to create a more efficient and effective organization that could conduct cyber defense, espionage, and offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber operations are centralized under the Networks Systems Department. It includes the previous Third Department (3PLA), which housed the majority of cyber operations; Fourth Department (4PLA), which was responsible for computer network attacks; and the Informatization Department, which handled network defense. The Network Systems Department includes such elements as the 61726 Unit (Wuhan) and the 61786 Unit (Beijing). The 311 Base that oversees the three warfares is directly under the PLASSF, as are PLA Units 61486 and 61419, which have been tied to cyberattacks against European, U.S., Japanese, and South Korean officials. Figure 2.3 highlights some of China’s main military organizations, which all sit under the Central Military Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of State Security (MSS) is China’s main civilian intelligence and counterintelligence authority responsible for domestic and foreign intelligence operations. The organizational structure of the MSS consists of a central ministry, provincial state security departments, and state security bureaus. The 2017 National Intelligence Act gave the MSS broad powers to compel Chinese citizens and organizations to assist with intelligence activities as well as to monitor domestic and foreign individuals and entities. This power allows China to leverage a range of non-state actors to assist with intelligence collection. Indeed, China has historically relied on front organizations, contractors, and private citizens to conduct state-sponsored offensive cyber operations, which allows the government to claim deniability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSS is heavily involved in influence operations overseas, which is a critical aspect of political warfare. For example, the MSS’s Tenth Bureau infiltrates overseas Chinese student and dissident groups, the Eleventh Bureau engages Western diplomats and others, and the Twelfth Bureau manages front organizations designed to influence Western targets of influence. As MI5, the United Kingdom’s domestic intelligence agency, warned UK citizens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The motive behind Chinese intelligence service cultivation of Westerners is primarily to make “friends”: once a “friendship” is formed [they] will use the relationship to obtain information which is not legally or commercially available to China and to promote China’s interest. Cultivation of a contact of interest is likely to develop slowly: [they] are very patient. . . . The aim of these tactics is to create a debt of obligation on the part of the target, who will eventually find it difficult to refuse inevitable requests for favours in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SECURITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) is the lead domestic civilian police force, with responsibility for establishing public order, supervising public information networks, and conducting other law enforcement functions. It shares the counterintelligence mission with, and is directed by, the MSS. This shared mission with the MSS typically involves monitoring dissidents and foreigners located within China as well as policing the internet and social media platforms. The MPS’s Eleventh Bureau, the Cybersecurity Protection Bureau, is involved in targeting cybercrime and overseeing the protection system for information security. The MPS is involved in a range of political warfare activities, including influence operations, cyber activity, and monitoring members of the Chinese diaspora overseas through extraterritorial police stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) oversees China’s network infrastructure, including data security. The MIIT has coordinated with technology companies, including Huawei and Tencent, as well as elite universities to develop an open-source hosting platform in China, relying on Gitee, the Chinese alternative to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UNITED FRONT WORK DEPARTMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overseen by the Central Committee of the CCP, the United Front Work Department (UFWD) attempts to protect and bolster the image of the party by monitoring and countering criticism overseas — often by recruiting or pressuring the Chinese diaspora. The Chinese government considers members of the diaspora to be “overseas compatriots” (侨同胞们), who owe a measure of loyalty to the Chinese homeland. There is purposefully some confusion about UFWD activity, as MSS personnel have operated under the cover of the UFWD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the CCP has long emphasized the importance of united front work to conduct influence operations, with Xi Jinping calling it a “magic weapon” (法宝). Since 2015, Xi has advocated for the “Great United Front” and endeavored to reinvigorate united front work across the globe. Rather than leaving united front work only up to the UFWD, the Great United Front initiative supports united front work as a critical aspect of the CCP. United front work focuses on several targets: members of minority political parties (parties other than the CCP which are legally allowed to exist); general individuals who are not members of the CCP; intellectuals who are not members of the CCP; ethnic minorities; important religious figures; key corporate officials; members of the new social strata; students that are overseas or who have recently returned, including their relatives in the mainland; compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, including their relatives in the mainland; and overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and relatives of overseas Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) is responsible for the foreign relations of China, including formulating foreign policy, administering the nation’s diplomatic missions, representing Chinese interests at the United Nations, negotiating foreign treaties, and advising the State Council on foreign affairs. Foreign affairs officials have also been involved in political warfare actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the outbreak of Covid-19, for example, senior officials from the MFA were heavily involved in disinformation and misinformation — including efforts directed at the United States. Zhao Lijian, an MFA spokesman, wrote on Twitter in March 2020 that the U.S. military might have spread Covid-19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” he wrote. “Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” The claim that the U.S. Army had infected individuals in Wuhan was utterly false. Undeterred, the Chinese government amplified the claim on the official Twitter accounts of Chinese embassies and consulates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MFA was also involved in an influence campaign directed at the National Basketball Association, which is discussed in more detail in Chapter 5. In 2019, the Chinese government reacted angrily when Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team, supported protesters in Hong Kong. He tweeted: “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.” In response, the Chinese consulate in Houston released a statement expressing its “strong dissatisfaction” with Morey’s tweet, noting that “anybody with conscience would support the efforts made by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to safeguard Hong Kong’s social stability.” In 2020, the U.S. government retaliated by ordering China to close its consulate in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a range of state organizations — such as the PLA, MSS, MPS, MIIT, UFWD, and MFA — are integral to the planning and execution of political warfare. These organizations have frequently leveraged private citizens (including overseas Chinese), companies, and non-governmental organizations to assist in irregular activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this chapter shows, political warfare is an important aspect of China’s strategy of national rejuvenation. China conducts political warfare to expand its power and influence below the level of armed conflict and to minimize security concerns that might be triggered by conventional warfare. Chinese leaders are sensitive about being perceived as revanchist. During the 20th National Congress, Xi Jinping adamantly noted that China was only interested in “peaceful development,” including a desire to “further consolidate national security; fulfill the goals for the centenary of the People’s Liberation Army in 2027; make solid progress in building a Peaceful China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese state and non-state actors have conducted several types of activities as part of political warfare: intelligence operations, cyber operations, information and disinformation operations, united front activity, irregular military actions, and economic coercion. For example, the CCP has used its economic clout to suppress international criticism of its own violations of democratic principles and human rights. It has also pressured governments, international institutions, and the private sector to echo its preferred narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes are high. For the United States and the West at large, China is the chief ideological opponent, largest economic and technological competitor (including in such battlegrounds as microelectronics, 5G wireless technology, and artificial intelligence), most capable military challenger, and greatest geopolitical rival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help understand the nuances of China’s political warfare, the next chapter focuses on intelligence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intelligence-operations&quot;&gt;INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ability of foreign affairs, news, military, security, and other departments to collect information and intelligence has been significantly improved, and the ability of relevant leading departments to comprehensively evaluate information and intelligence has continuously strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-zhang-tuosheng&quot;&gt;– Zhang Tuosheng&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This chapter examines Chinese intelligence operations as part of political warfare, particularly Chinese actions against the United States.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; While espionage is a normal part of statecraft, this report focuses on the political warfare aspects of intelligence operations. Intelligence operations play a critical role in political warfare by helping states — in this case China — obtain political, military, economic, and other information to coerce or otherwise gain a competitive advantage over an adversary. Intelligence operations also play an important role in informing and supporting other components of political warfare, such as information and disinformation campaigns, united front activity, and economic coercion. As Linda Robinson concludes in her study of political warfare, “Political warfare places a high demand on intelligence.” As another assessment concludes, “Conducting political warfare by trying to build up foreign groups requires reliable intelligence about those groups’ motivations as well as about their capacities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few characterizations better describe the modern Chinese intelligence apparatus than a passage from the 2,400-year-old military treatise &lt;em&gt;The Methods of the Sima&lt;/em&gt;: “In general, to wage war: employ spies against the distant, observe the near.” Along these lines, this chapter analyzes how China’s military and civilian intelligence services employ spies as part of political warfare, with the primary intent of illuminating Chinese human intelligence (HUMINT) tradecraft and collection priorities. Overall, Chinese overseas intelligence activities are more centrally directed and driven by specific intelligence priorities than is typically acknowledged. Many — including the chief of the United Kingdom’s Security Service (MI5) — describe China pursuing a “thousand grains of sand” intelligence strategy, describing how China uses citizens in key positions to collect small pieces of information that together form a more complete intelligence picture. Such a strategy is much harder to disrupt. As this chapter shows, the empirical, open-source record indicates that Chinese HUMINT operations are methodical, resource intensive, and driven by well-defined intelligence priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter diverges from most existing literature on Chinese intelligence activities by analyzing Beijing’s HUMINT services through the lens of the HUMINT agent acquisition cycle, the five-phase process used by intelligence officers to spot, assess, develop, recruit, and handle human sources. This process is important in understanding Chinese political warfare. The analysis relies on a review of cases of known or suspected Chinese intelligence activities, with a particular focus on cases dating from 2015 to present. It includes an evaluation of court records from more than 100 U.S. indictments of individuals accused of conducting activities on behalf of China as well as analysis of similar cases overseas where that data is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Chinese primary source documents describing the structure and operations of the country’s civilian and military intelligence services are scarce, recent Chinese counterintelligence investigations and disclosures by intelligence and law enforcement agencies worldwide are generating an increasing volume of data that illuminates the operational tradecraft of China’s intelligence services. These disclosures expose key patterns and commonalities across cases during each phase of China’s efforts to recruit sources and to shape these sources’ collection. While the majority of data analyzed in support of this chapter were derived from U.S. federal court documents, there is ample evidence that the Chinese intelligence tradecraft and collection priorities apply equally to U.S. partners. As such, these findings — although largely focused on U.S. examples — can contribute to global efforts to detect and disrupt Chinese intelligence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this chapter begins with a brief overview of China’s intelligence services. It then proceeds into further analysis of how the Chinese intelligence services execute overseas operations across the spotting, assessing, developing, recruiting, and handling phases, which are critical for political warfare. Finally, this chapter examines Chinese intelligence and law enforcement efforts to intimidate and harass members of the Chinese diaspora living overseas — including in the United States — by such organizations as the Ministry of Public Security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-intelligence-services&quot;&gt;CHINA’S INTELLIGENCE SERVICES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary Chinese intelligence activities are primarily conducted under the 2017 National Intelligence Law. The law does not explicitly define the roles and responsibilities of the civilian and military agencies that comprise China’s intelligence community, but it describes many of the intelligence services’ broader authorities. For example, Article 7 requires that “all organizations and citizens shall support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts in accordance with the law, and shall protect national intelligence work secrets they are aware of.” Article 12 authorizes China’s intelligence services to “establish cooperative relationships with relevant individuals and organizations and retain them to carry out related work.” Both of these provisions establish the legal basis for some of the Chinese intelligence services’ key patterns of behavior, specifically their heavy reliance on various cut-outs and proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence serves a central role in broader Chinese Communist Party (CCP) history and lore. In 1931, three CCP spies who had penetrated the Kuomintang security apparatus provided early warning that a high-level CCP intelligence official had defected to the Kuomintang. Mao Zedong later claimed that this operation — known as the Three Heroes of the Dragon’s Lair — changed the course of the revolution by warning key underground cadre that they would soon be exposed. Among those who were saved was China’s future premier Zhou Enlai, who served a key role in Chinese intelligence and security affairs until his death in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese intelligence apparatus has been reorganized repeatedly since the founding of the CCP and the establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). While roles, missions, and organizational structure have changed, the one constant is that the CCP and China have maintained formalized, professional intelligence services since the party’s founding in 1927. This structure has evolved today into a broader Chinese intelligence community that includes both civilian and military elements, as outlined in Figure 3.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the civilian side, the Ministry of State Security (MSS) has been Beijing’s premier foreign intelligence service since it was established in 1983. The MSS is often described as combining the foreign intelligence collection responsibilities of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) with the domestic counterintelligence and counterespionage authorities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). This analogy is useful — up to a point — in describing the overarching mission of the MSS. However, the MSS combines these foreign and domestic authorities in unique ways when conducting its operations. This results in several hallmark characteristics of Chinese intelligence operations. Perhaps most notable is Beijing’s continued reliance on mainland China not just as a hub for operational oversight and coordination but for the actual business of recruiting and handling foreign sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSS is composed of a headquarters component and approximately 18 component bureaus. Each of these subordinate bureaus is assigned a number and charged with a specific functional or regional portfolio. For example, as of 2018, the Sixth Bureau was responsible for overseas collection on science and technology issues. The MSS also maintains provincial and city divisions and bureaus, such as the Shanghai State Security Bureau, the Beijing State Security Bureau, and the Jiangsu State Security Department (JSSD). Each of these regional MSS offices mirrors the numbered component structure of MSS headquarters so that the JSSD, for example, has its own Sixth Bureau that likely coordinates with the Sixth Bureau at MSS headquarters in Beijing. Several scholars over the years have scoured Chinese primary sources in an effort to map the specific structure, roles, and responsibilities of the MSS. However, the accuracy of this work is variable and often becomes quickly dated. One attribute that the Chinese intelligence services share with their Western counterparts is a tendency to reorganize, including the MSS’s rearrangement of bureau numbers. For example, MSS files disclosed in a U.S. court case revealed that the overseas science and technology bureau in the JSSD was renumbered from the Fourth Bureau to the Sixth Bureau in December 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) is China’s primary domestic security service. The MPS is mainly responsible for police work within China, but it also has extensive internal security authorities. Since the initiation of Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign at the 18th Party Congress in 2012, the MPS has been increasingly tied to overseas operations. These activities are less focused on collecting political, economic, or military intelligence information. Instead, they are an extension of a decades-long role for the MPS in “political security,” which includes efforts to exert pressure on overseas dissidents and perceived enemies. The MPS traditionally has undertaken domestic activities to send messages to its targets overseas, such as by arresting family members in China. The MPS continues this specific technique but is now augmenting this domestic pressure with deployments overseas to harass, intimidate, and repatriate overseas Chinese citizens who Beijing accuses of political or financial corruption. These activities are likely spearheaded by the MPS’s First Bureau, which is reportedly responsible for monitoring Chinese political dissidents who live outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States and its partners, the MPS’s overseas operations are arguably the most concerning of any of China’s overseas intelligence activities. This is because the MPS is engaged in operations that extend far beyond the boundaries of traditional espionage. Espionage — that is, spying on other nations to glean insights about their capabilities and intentions — is an accepted, acknowledged, and normal practice by intelligence agencies in the arena of geopolitics. MPS operations, however, are often something entirely different. In many circumstances, they manifest in egregious violations of another nation’s sovereignty or reflect a blatant refusal to accept international law. These operations involve attempts by Beijing to extend the arm of its increasingly authoritarian governance to any of its perceived enemies, anywhere in the world — even if it means violating the constitutions and laws of the democratic nations where the MPS conducts these activities. Examples include uncoordinated law enforcement activities on a global scale, with recent reports indicating that Chinese law enforcement elements have quietly established more than 50 “overseas police service centers” in 21 countries across five continents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), two branches are primarily charged with intelligence duties. The Intelligence Bureau of the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission is the PLA’s primary HUMINT arm, roughly equivalent to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Prior to the large-scale reorganization and modernization of the PLA in late 2015, the Intelligence Bureau was known as the Second Department of the General Staff Department of the PLA, more commonly known as 2PLA. The bureau was traditionally complemented by signals intelligence, electronic warfare, information operations, and offensive cyber capabilities within the Third Department (3PLA) and Fourth Department (4PLA). Of these groups, 3PLA maintains the highest public profile outside of China. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted five 3PLA computer network operators in 2014, and the economic espionage activities of one of the organization’s components (Unit 61398) were exposed by a U.S. cybersecurity firm in 2013 Both 3PLA and 4PLA were renamed and reorganized during a series of PLA reforms in late 2015, with both components likely integrated into the Network Systems Department of the PLA’s Strategic Support Force (SSF), which is also subordinate to the Central Military Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-intelligence-doctrine-and-the-agent-acquisition-cycle&quot;&gt;CHINA’S INTELLIGENCE DOCTRINE AND THE AGENT ACQUISITION CYCLE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter’s focus on examining Chinese intelligence operations through the lens of the agent acquisition cycle serves two purposes. The first purpose is to illuminate how China’s national-level intelligence collection priorities are operationalized by the intelligence services. This includes describing how the MSS and its counterparts identify and approach potential sources, task and handle these sources, and how the services work with specific customers to refine information needs and requirements. The second purpose is to examine how the various elements of the Chinese state — including the CCP, state research institutions, private companies, and the technical, cyber, and HUMINT elements of the intelligence services — contribute to Chinese intelligence operations. The goal is to provide a more coherent alternative to the common characterization of the Chinese intelligence threat as “one thousand grains of sand.” This term can lend the inaccurate impression that China’s activities are decentralized and opportunistic, while also opening the United States and its allies to criticism that they are indiscriminately targeting Chinese academics, students, businesspeople, and journalists by labeling them all as suspected agents of the CCP. The intent is to use fact-based, empirical evidence to illuminate Chinese intelligence tradecraft, which includes the activities of the state organs, affiliated research and development institutions, and various cut-outs, co-optees, and nontraditional collectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese primary sources describing Beijing’s modern approach to intelligence theory, doctrine, and operations are less abundant compared to writings on other security topics, particularly Beijing’s views on military modernization and strategy. Nevertheless, Chinese documents across the spectrum of national security strategy and doctrine reflect the abiding importance of intelligence in statecraft and warfare. Information is at the heart of Beijing’s military modernization efforts, which emphasize the pursuit of “information dominance.” While these documents reflect the enduring importance of intelligence to modern China, much of what Western scholars know about the specifics of how China’s clandestine services advance Beijing’s interests come from the U.S. prosecution of Chinese officers and agents, public warnings from Western leaders, and non-government analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the few Chinese-language documents available in the West illuminating China’s approach to intelligence work is a book published in 1991 by two Chinese intelligence veterans — Huo Zhongwen and Wang Zongxiao — titled &lt;em&gt;Sources and Techniques of Obtaining National Defense Science and Technology Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;. It describes a broader Chinese intelligence apparatus that is built to advance both national security and commercial interests. The book examines how science and technology collection is a shared responsibility across the intelligence services, research and academic institutions, and state-owned enterprises. It is a system that maintains no clear lines between military modernization and economic growth, a distinction that — at least in the United States — is a line established in intelligence policy and doctrine. As Huo and Wang conclude: “Intelligence work will become the heart of the new industrial revolution.” This perspective on intelligence can be observed in cases where China’s professional intelligence officers collaborate with science and technology institutions to identify collection requirements that advance China’s commercial interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huo and Wang’s work also describes China’s historical reliance on open-source information, which in their estimation accounted for 80 percent of China’s science and technology intelligence collection. Like the Soviets during the Cold War, China recognized the intelligence value of various Western periodicals and government reports, and Huo and Wang’s work methodically details the specific governmental and nongovernmental sources of technical insights that were of particular benefit to China’s commercial and military modernization. Nevertheless, they acknowledge that the remaining 20 percent of China’s intelligence needs “must come through the collection of information using special means, such as reconnaissance satellites, electronic eavesdropping, and the activities of special agents (purchasing or stealing), etc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the blurring of national security and commercial interests in China’s approach to intelligence collection, Huo and Wang argue that China shares with the West similar perspectives on the broader intelligence collection process, specifically the intelligence cycle. They emphasize the importance of developing collection requirements, identifying the most effective means of collecting against certain requirements, and “immediately [analyzing and studying] the feedback that has been received from the information consumer and adjust the collection process in a timely manner, thus improving the work of collection.” Although there is no definitive open-source Chinese intelligence doctrine available, the cases reviewed in support of this chapter strongly suggest that the MSS and its counterparts adhere to many of the same fundamentals of the traditional intelligence cycle and, as an extension of that cycle, the recruitment of human agents using techniques that are shared historically with China’s foreign counterparts, including the CIA, MI6, and Russian intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;spotting-and-assessing&quot;&gt;SPOTTING AND ASSESSING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall agent recruiting process can be thought of as a filter, as illustrated in Figure 3.1. At the top are the two broadest phases: spotting and assessing. Activities within these two phases are highly interconnected, as they are both largely analytic and, in most circumstances, passive. It is also in these two phases where there is ample evidence demonstrating how the Chinese intelligence services integrate all-source capabilities into their efforts to identify and evaluate potential human sources. Specifically, China’s intelligence services employ and often blend three primary techniques during the spotting and assessing phase: open-source intelligence analysis; domestic and overseas cut-outs, co-optees, and proxies; and technical operations, including computer network intrusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is during the spot and assess phases that HUMINT collectors begin the process of transforming customer intelligence requirements into actual collection. Depending on the specificity of the information need, the potential pool of sources that are initially spotted and assessed can range from exceptionally large to exceptionally small. For example, one U.S.-based spotter for the MSS simply sought contact with individuals with current or prior military or intelligence experience. Initial contacts would be routed back to MSS officers in China for further assessment of the individual’s potential access to classified or other non-public information that would be responsive to China’s information needs. In other circumstances, the spotting and assessing pool will be narrowly tailored, such as focusing on individuals who may have access to highly specialized technologies that would contribute to China’s economic or military modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CUT-OUTS, CO-OPTEES, AND PROXIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important trademark of Chinese intelligence operations is the use of various cut-outs, co-optees, and proxies. The use of such individuals — who often present themselves as businesspeople, students, or academics — creates a buffer of plausible deniability between China’s intelligence apparatus and its potential human sources. China’s clandestine services have not traditionally adopted the same operating models as their U.S., UK, Russian, or other counterparts. In these countries, intelligence officers are often celebrated for their ability to navigate hostile or denied environments. Leveraging various types of official or nonofficial cover, CIA, MI6, and KGB officers during the Cold War developed innovative and sophisticated tradecraft that they used to recruit and handle high-level sources within an adversary’s government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPOT&lt;/strong&gt; individuals who have the potential to fulfill intelligence requirements as identified by analysts or policymakers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASSESS&lt;/strong&gt; the placement and access of these individuals to determine if they can provide the desired information and initiate an evaluation of their motivations, vulnerabilities, and suitability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEVELOP&lt;/strong&gt; relationships with these individuals to further assess their motivations, vulnerabilities, and suitability and to explore their receptiveness to initial tasking for intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECRUIT&lt;/strong&gt; agents and formalize the relationship with an overt recruitment pitch or by paying them for information they provide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HANDLE&lt;/strong&gt; agents by relaying collection requirements, receiving reporting information, and conducting continued assessments of their placement and access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SOURCE: CSIS RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS; AND BURKETT, “AN ALTERNATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR AGENT RECRUITMENT.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s isolation during most of the Cold War fostered a very different HUMINT culture, one that involved a much less prominent overseas role for the intelligence cadre. Compounding this isolation was the paranoia of the Cultural Revolution, where the relentless focus on ideological purity and widespread suspicions of foreign influence resulted in purges within the intelligence and security apparatus. The MSS did deploy some personnel abroad — for example, under journalistic cover — during the Cold War, but their primary mission was unclear. They likely assisted broader efforts to spot and assess potential sources while also collecting insights and non-public information from individuals who believed they were speaking with Chinese state media. However, none were definitively tied to sensitive recruitments within the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Chinese intelligence services have traditionally preferred that recruitments and subsequent source meetings occur inside of China or a third country. The comparatively limited overseas footprint of China’s HUMINT officers likely nurtured the culture of using proxies and cut-outs as key components in the spotting and assessing phase. In the current era, social media and the internet are increasingly used for the spotting and assessing phases, though recent cases reinforce that overseas proxies continue to be key contributors to early-stage recruiting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes the case of Jun Wei Yeo, a Singaporean national who was convicted in the United States on charges that he was serving as a spotter and assessor for the MSS. Yeo received intelligence requirements from China-based MSS officers, who relied on Yeo to spot and assess potential U.S.-based sources. Yeo’s MSS handlers had a wide range of intelligence interests, with a particular focus on non-public U.S. government information. These taskings included requests for Yeo to identify sources who could report on Southeast Asia, the U.S. Department of Commerce, artificial intelligence, and the trade war between the United States and China. On multiple occasions, Yeo met separately with different MSS officers in China, all of whom issued identical tasking. These incidents further reinforce this chapter’s broader contention that Chinese intelligence collection is more centrally directed and organized than is often appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE ROLE OF OPEN-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE AND SOCIAL MEDIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the spotting and assessing phases, recent investigations and global intelligence service statements reflect that open-source intelligence analysis — particularly the exploitation of social media — has become a preferred technique for China’s intelligence services. According to U.S., UK, and German intelligence officials, Chinese intelligence officers and proxies have conducted thousands of soft approaches on LinkedIn in recent years. More than 10,000 such incidents have occurred in the United Kingdom alone, according to MI5 chief Ken McCallum. A 2017 study conducted by Germany’s domestic intelligence service, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV), found China’s intelligence approaches on LinkedIn to match the scale observed by MI5. In its report, the BfV disclosed several inauthentic profiles and front organizations, posting as headhunters, consultants, think tanks, and scholars, who the service assessed were working for Chinese intelligence. This shift toward social media in the early phases of the recruitment process offers the Chinese intelligence services a platform to conduct low-cost, low-risk activities in the early phases of the recruitment cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several notable investigations in the United States since 2017 reflect how China’s intelligence services use LinkedIn to identify and evaluate potential sources of classified information, trade secrets, and other non-public information. In many instances, Chinese intelligence uses LinkedIn to identify and contact current and former cleared government employees or to advertise various business, consulting, and employment opportunities that may interest former members of the intelligence community or U.S. Department of Defense. Jun Wei Yeo used social media, particularly LinkedIn, extensively in his activities on behalf of the MSS. Yeo created a fake consulting company and posted job opportunities on LinkedIn. He later claimed he received over 400 resumes, 90 percent of which were submitted by current and former U.S. government and military personnel with security clearances. Yeo then forwarded the resumes to MSS officers in China for further evaluation and guidance on potential recruitment options. Yeo augmented his efforts on LinkedIn by attending public events to contact individuals from lobbying firms or defense contracting companies who could be possible targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s bulk data theft campaigns — including operations targeting the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Equifax, Anthem, Marriott, and others — are examined in this report’s chapter on Chinese cyber operations (Chapter 4). Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the extent to which Beijing’s acquisition of this data can contribute to HUMINT operations. While these operations have been attributed to various elements of the Chinese intelligence services — primarily regional components of the MSS and the 3PLA — there is little definitive evidence available detailing how China may be weaponizing this data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the information from these operations could help HUMINT officers assess potential avenues to recruit a source. Examples might include verifying an individual’s current or prior relationship with the U.S. government, identifying whether that individual is in financial distress or poor health, scrutinizing their travel history, or shaping ways to develop an initial approach and a source development plan. Four factors typically influence an individual’s decision to spy for a foreign government: money, ideology, compromise, or ego, often referred to as “MICE.” What is known about the personal data that China has exfiltrated suggests that the information could be highly valuable for Chinese HUMINT recruiters weighing whether an individual may be vulnerable to certain recruitment approaches. The U.S.-based MSS spotter Jun Wei Yeo attested that these types of vulnerabilities, including financial troubles, job dissatisfaction, or familial issues, were what he was trained by the MSS to evaluate when assessing source candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;developing-and-recruiting&quot;&gt;DEVELOPING AND RECRUITING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotting and assessing are intended to narrow a pool of potential source candidates. It is against this smaller group that intelligence officers initiate the process of building a relationship with prospective sources. Key markers of this phase for Chinese intelligence operations include increased face-to-face contact, often in China during the source development phase. Overall, the majority of development approaches analyzed in support of this research involved offers of employment, business, consulting, or other financial opportunities, with a smaller set of individuals driven by ideological support for China and the CCP. Ultimately, postmortems of historic American espionage cases find that most spies are motivated by a combination of the MICE factors rather than by one factor alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developing and recruiting phases of the agent acquisition cycle substantially increase the volume of risk that a recruiting organization incurs. The spotting and assessing phases are largely passive, while the developing and recruiting phases are active and increasingly expose recruiters to potential discovery. China partially compensates for this risk during the development and recruitment phases by continuing its reliance on cut-outs, proxies, and other forms of cover. Chinese intelligence officers and their proxies primarily approach developmental sources under commercial or academic cover. There is a dual logic in this approach, providing plausible deniability to both recruiter and target. Recruiters present themselves as representing private or academic interests rather than China and the CCP. This approach may appeal to prospective recruits interested in rationalizing their openness to providing information to a foreign entity. In the case of Kevin Mallory, his responsiveness to initial contact via LinkedIn translated into an introduction to an individual who represented himself as working for a Chinese think tank, the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Despite these efforts to operate under the nominal cover of the academy, which is known to have close ties to the MSS, Mallory — as a former CIA and DIA officer — appears to have been aware that the individuals he met with were representatives of Chinese intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of approaches and initial taskings epitomize the developmental phases of HUMINT operations. Developmental recruits are often asked to share information that may be somewhat sensitive — though not classified — as a means to gauge the source’s responsiveness to tasking, as well as to lay the groundwork for gradually expanding the information-sharing relationship into more sensitive areas. The added exchange of money at this phase — even before any formal recruitment pitch — also establishes the terms of what will ultimately become a transactional relationship. In cases where the source is a U.S. government employee or cleared defense contractor, this information exposes the recruit to legal jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s development and recruitment of Shapour Moinian followed a similar pattern. After an initial approach on LinkedIn, Moinian traveled to Hong Kong to meet with an individual who claimed to represent a technical recruiting company seeking out aviation industry consultants. The Chinese recruiter claimed she was seeking Moinian’s “rich experiences and skills” for a client who was working on aircraft design. Moinian agreed to provide information and materials regarding various aircraft designed or manufactured in the United States, for which he was financially compensated. An unnamed UK aviation expert mentioned by MI5 in July 2022 also traveled repeatedly to China to be “wined and dined.” The Chinese interlocutors then asked and paid him for detailed technical information on military aircraft, at which point the UK government intervened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial cover was also a key feature of China’s recruitment of former FBI electronics technician Kun Shan “Joey” Chun. However, unlike the Mallory and Moinian cases, where the developmental phase required only of a handful of meetings, Chun’s relationship with Chinese intelligence took several years to reach the stage where he began meeting directly with Chinese government officials and providing them with sensitive FBI information. Chun’s relationship originated in 2005, when a China-based printer company solicited an investment from one of Chun’s relatives. Over the next five years, the Chinese company paid for Chun to travel on an annual basis, travel that he actively concealed from the FBI. In 2011, the company paid for a trip to Europe, where Chun met directly with a Chinese government official who told Chun he knew he worked for the FBI. At this stage, Chun began reporting information about FBI personnel, structure, technological capabilities, surveillance practices, and surveillance targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One variation of China’s efforts to appeal to commercial and economic interests of potential sources is the manner in which the intelligence services work through research institutes and universities. This includes recruitment into China’s so-called “talent plans,” such as the Thousand Talents Plan and the Hundred Talents Plan. Disaggregating the numerous licit and illicit mechanisms that China relies upon to acquire advanced technology from the United States is beyond the scope of this chapter. Nevertheless, several recent cases reveal how China’s state-affiliated research institutions and the talent plans have served as critical platforms for China to extract trade secrets and intellectual property (IP) from U.S.-based sources. Although many cases do not involve a direct connection between China’s research institutions and the intelligence services, there are some striking exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most notable is the trial of Yanjun Xu, an MSS officer who was the deputy division director of the Sixth Bureau in the JSSD. In that case, the United States disclosed how the Sixth Bureau, which is responsible for overseas collection of science and technology information, worked directly with organizations such as the Jiangsu Science and Technology Promotion Association, the Aviation Industry of China (AVIC), and the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronomics (NUAA) to arrange presentations and exchanges with overseas experts known to be working on technologies that were Chinese collection priorities. This included Xu in his capacity as an MSS officer directly arranging a set of discussions in China with experts from across the global aviation industry, including representatives of at least six of the world’s leading aerospace companies. As reflected in Xu’s communications with his intelligence customers within the Chinese science and technology apparatus, the purpose of these exchanges was to elicit sensitive IP and trade secrets, including items such as design manuals, design and simulation software, composites, power systems, and other information about civilian and military aircraft. The MSS often augments its human source development efforts during “exchanges” in China by conducting technical operations against their visitors’ devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the primary methods that China uses to spot, assess, develop, and recruit sources, the final element involves the specific tradecraft that China uses to handle its human sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;handling-sources-operationalizing-intelligence-requirements&quot;&gt;HANDLING SOURCES: OPERATIONALIZING INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s global intelligence activities are merely one element of broader political warfare. Nevertheless, they are a critical element of Beijing’s approach to security competition. China’s pursuit of various forms of classified U.S. defense and intelligence information contributes to broader efforts to secure an information advantage over the United States, particularly if Beijing were to learn information about the United States that Washington believes to be protected. This logic extends into the science and technology sphere, where Chinese intelligence operations are designed to fulfill key knowledge gaps for China’s commercial and military technology research and development efforts. China’s intelligence services play a crucial role in recruiting human sources to fulfill specific customer science and technology requirements for China’s economic and military advantage. It is in this area that the case of MSS officer Yanjun Xu is so striking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously noted, Xu was a senior MSS officer assigned to the JSSD Sixth Bureau, where he was responsible for collecting overseas science and technology information. In his activities, Xu worked closely with officials in various state entities, including AVIC and the NUAA, to refine aviation-related collection requirements. For example, in 2013, Xu exchanged messages with an official at AVIC who relayed specific information that the AVIC official was seeking from Boeing, including analytical tools for Boeing’s proprietary airframe and specific portions of the &lt;em&gt;Boeing Design Manual&lt;/em&gt;. These types of exchanges are critical in understanding the specificity of Chinese science and technology collection requirements that were directly passed from state-owned enterprises and research institutions to China’s foreign intelligence service. Separate communications revealed how Xu and the MSS would report back information that had been collected. In one instance, Xu sent detailed technical information about various aspects of the KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft, requesting that the recipient review the information and provide feedback on the MSS’s report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of insights into the inner workings of the MSS and its customers manifest in the ways that China handles its human sources. In Xu’s case, the MSS and the NUAA directly collaborated to shape the specific topics that visitors would brief during their presentations in China. In one case, Xu and the NUAA official worked in tandem to encourage a U.S.-based aerospace engineer to provide a presentation on highly technical topics related to GE Aviation’s trade secrets and IP. As the relationship between Xu and the engineer progressed, Xu was clear about how information requirements were being developed, writing to the engineer: “I will touch base with the scientific research department here to see what technology is desired and I will let you know what to prepare.” Xu later refined the specific areas of interest for the engineer, expressing that there was particular interest in software, system specifications, and design processes. Later, when the engineer expressed concern about sending certain information from his GE Aviation e-mail address, Xu responded: “It might be inappropriate to send directly from the company, right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overseas-harassment-and-repression&quot;&gt;OVERSEAS HARASSMENT AND REPRESSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese intelligence agencies have also been increasingly active in intimidating members of the Chinese diaspora overseas and in conducting influence operations. Many of these instances are part of Operation Fox Hunt, a global and extralegal PRC effort to monitor, harass, and in some cases repatriate Chinese diaspora living abroad. In June 2023, for example, a federal jury in New York convicted three individuals of stalking and coercing several residents of the United States. In April 2023, the FBI arrested two individuals, “Harry” Lu Jianwang and Chen Jinping, in connection with opening and operating an illegal police station in Manhattan, New York City. According to the FBI and DOJ, the two individuals were working for the Fuzhou branch of the MPS to locate and conduct coercive activities against Chinese dissidents living in the United States. Lu Jianwang’s official role was president of the America Changle Association NY, a nonprofit organization whose offices housed the police outpost. In its response to the arrests, the Chinese embassy in Washington described the organization as being “provided by local overseas Chinese communities who would like to be helpful” and that “they are not police personnel from China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a separate case, the DOJ charged 40 MPS officers in April 2023 with conducting an intimidation campaign against Chinese nationals residing in the United States whose political views and actions were critical of China. The DOJ has referred to this type of activity as “repression schemes.” Also in April 2023, a federal jury convicted Pras Michel, a Grammy-winning artist and former member of the hip-hop group Fugees, of working with the MPS to conduct a clandestine campaign to influence senior U.S. officials. More broadly, the Chinese government has conducted widespread harassment of Chinese critics of China abroad, though it is not always clear if — and to what degree — Chinese intelligence and law enforcement organizations are involved. Beginning in October 2022, for example, China was allegedly involved in making more than a dozen false bomb threats at luxury hotels and embassies in Europe, the United States, the Middle East, and Asia using the names of Chinese dissidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Operation Fox Hunt, China has also engaged in Operation Skynet, a parallel program to target the finances of Chinese citizens, including dissidents, residing overseas. According to the FBI, Operation Skynet includes PRC efforts to repatriate money by some Chinese living abroad “by both restricting and seizing assets still located in the PRC.” In 2022, for example, DOJ charged Sun Hoi Ying with conducting illegal activities as part of Operation Skynet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese diplomatic officials argued that these organizations — including the so-called police stations — were not actually engaged in police and intelligence work and that they were staffed by “volunteers” who were responsible for assisting Chinese nationals with routine tasks, such as renewing drivers’ licenses. In some cases, researchers identified connections between various overseas police outposts and specific regional components of the MPS, tying such stations directly back to Chinese intelligence and law enforcement. One study of these MPS stations assessed that there are at least 104 of these outposts across 53 countries. As an FBI investigation into a Chinese police station in New York City found, the MPS was unambiguously involved in harassing members of the Chinese diaspora in the United States. According to the lead FBI agent involved in the investigation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although the MPS is generally identified as the PRC’s primary domestic law enforcement agency — responsible for public safety, general criminal investigation, national security and internet security — its mission extends beyond law enforcement and into functions more associated with an intelligence service. The MPS routinely monitors, among others, Chinese political dissidents who live in the United States and in other locations outside the PRC. The MPS has used cooperative contacts both inside the PRC and around the world to influence, threaten and coerce political dissidents abroad. Indeed, I am aware that the PRC government has threatened and coerced Chinese political dissidents living in the United States in an effort to silence them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring the impact of Chinese intelligence operations as part of political warfare is challenging on several levels. The first challenge is defining what counts as intelligence operations in the modern era. China employs a wide range of licit and quasi-licit means to acquire sensitive and critical information. This includes investing in foreign firms that possess valuable IP that can support China’s military or commercial interests. It includes the use of “talent programs” and other joint research initiatives to facilitate the transfer of valuable technical knowledge back to Chinese institutions. As the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence acknowledged in a comprehensive study of the U.S. counterintelligence enterprise, competitors need not break U.S. laws to fulfill key intelligence collection needs. In one noteworthy recent study, a U.S. private intelligence firm identified 167 individuals connected to Los Alamos National Laboratory who had returned to China to work in areas critical to the PLA’s military modernization, including hypersonic weapons, deep-penetrating munitions, and undersea systems. A separate investigation by the Washington Post found that Chinese hypersonic researchers are simply purchasing from U.S. suppliers software that aids in designing and modeling hypersonic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are concerns about cyber-enabled economic intelligence efforts, which are analyzed in this report’s chapter on Chinese cyber operations (Chapter 4). The economic and strategic benefits of these activities are vast, particularly in terms of trade secrets, military technology, and sensitive U.S. government information stolen. In 2012, then head of the National Security Agency (NSA) General Keith Alexander described cyber-enabled economic espionage as “the greatest transfer of wealth in history.” The economic loss to the United States alone is often estimated at $30–600 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. economic losses also translate directly into Chinese military advances. Su Bin, a Chinese-Canadian businessman, assisted Chinese PLA cyber officers in their efforts to steal trade secrets regarding the C-17, F-22, and F-35 aircraft. This included more than 630,000 files — totaling more than 65 gigabytes — on the C-17 aircraft. Such theft allows China to evade the costs, both in time and money, to modernize its systems. For a sense of the scale of the investments that went into the three aircraft targeted during the Su Bin case, the U.S. government spent more than $100 billion over a period of more than three decades to modernize these airlift and fighter systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall economic damage caused by Chinese licit, quasi-licit, and cyber collection likely far outpaces that which can be attributed to the country’s HUMINT services. However, this is not to undersell the economic damage caused by HUMINT collection operations. Although not explicitly connected to the MSS, one recent U.S. conviction involved a scientist stealing trade secrets valued at $1 billion from a U.S. petroleum company. MSS officer Xu Yanjun worked to target GE Aviation’s processes for manufacturing composite jet engine fan blades, a technology that no other global company has duplicated in the more than 25 years since it was first certified by the Federal Aviation Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also difficult to measure the impact of Chinese efforts to acquire private information about U.S. and allied decisionmaking and policy, though it is critical to assess the totality of Chinese cases rather than isolated incidents. The reason is that Chinese intelligence officers have long recognized the value of what is often referred to as the “mosaic theory” of secrecy, in which individual facts can illuminate an otherwise opaque picture when integrated into a broader body of knowledge. As Huo and Wang wrote, “By picking here and there among the vast amount of public materials and accumulating information a drop at a time, often it is possible to basically reveal the outlines of some secret intelligence, and this is particularly true in the case of the Western countries.” Correspondingly, cases such as China’s successful recruitment of Candace Claiborne, a comparatively low-ranking U.S. State Department official, should be viewed merely as one piece within a broader mosaic. While Claiborne may not have operated within the inner circles of U.S. decisionmaking, her reporting on the periphery of these circles undoubtedly contributed to Beijing’s broader efforts to penetrate U.S. policy deliberations with respect to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a subset of cases that have undermined U.S. and allied national security in ways that are difficult to measure — but are likely significant. Consider the damage associated with the 2015 OPM breach, during which Chinese cyber actors stole detailed background investigation information for nearly 20 million U.S. citizens. This data included “Social Security Numbers; residency and educational history; employment history; information about immediate family and other personal and business acquaintances; health, criminal and financial history; and other details,” as well as “findings from interviews conducted by background investigators and fingerprints” for some individuals. From a HUMINT targeting perspective, the Chinese government — at a minimum — is in possession of detailed dossiers on nearly 20 million Americans who have applied for access to classified information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are the instances where Chinese agents have successfully penetrated U.S. intelligence agencies and gained access to government secrets, details of overseas intelligence operations, and the identities of U.S. sources in China. The first American intelligence officer charged with spying for China was Larry Wu-Tai Chin, a retired career linguist for the CIA’s Foreign Broadcast Information Service who passed classified information to Beijing for decades before his conviction in 1986. Prosecutors said of Chin at his trial, “For 30 years, he was a direct funnel from the American intelligence community to the People’s Republic of China.” Two more recent cases are those of Jerry Chun Shing Lee and Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, both former CIA case officers. Ma’s case, which is still pending, includes the submission into evidence of a 2001 video recording of Ma and a colleague meeting with MSS officers and revealing CIA officer identities, human asset identities, operational tradecraft, and security communication practices. Lee was convicted in a 2019 case where he was discovered traveling with a notebook that included “CIA-related operational notes from asset meetings, operational meeting locations, operational phone numbers, true names of assets, and information about covert facilities.” More broadly, China has expanded its signals intelligence collection capabilities against the United States by establishing intelligence collection facilities in Cuba, roughly 100 miles from Florida, and other locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s U.S. counterparts can attest, the public often only hears about intelligence failures, not successes. Nevertheless, the cases analyzed in connection to this chapter all included notable tradecraft failures on the part of the Chinese intelligence services. One of the more amusing is that, in the closing arguments at Yanjun Xu’s trial, his defense attorneys pointed to his poor tradecraft skills as a reason to doubt the U.S. government’s contention that he was a senior MSS officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some historians of Chinese intelligence have cited the country’s lack of a strong external HUMINT tradition as one of the reasons why Beijing has compensated by building a massive cyber operations capability. However, there are some types of information critical to China’s broader strategic interests that can only be pursued with human sources. Many of the cases cited in this chapter involved tradecraft that is likely unworkable in an era of heightened technical surveillance. This observation is doubly ironic given that China itself has built the world’s most advanced surveillance state. But China’s surveillance state only resolves half of the guidance from the 2,400-year-old &lt;em&gt;Methods of the Sima&lt;/em&gt; noted at the beginning of this chapter. While Beijing has nearly perfected its ability to “observe the near,” the current era of HUMINT will require China’s spies to modernize how they “employ spies against the distant.” And the success of Chinese political warfare will hinge, to some degree, on how well China can improve its HUMINT capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyber-operations&quot;&gt;CYBER OPERATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cyberspace has become a new pillar of economic and social development, and a new domain of national security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-chinas-military-strategy-2015&quot;&gt;– China’s Military Strategy (2015)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In January 2021, Microsoft’s John Lambert was on the edge of his seat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It felt like “the moment before a firecracker goes off. You know something’s going to happen and you want to know: How loud is this going to be?” The firecracker was a massive hack of Microsoft Exchange, a product used by an estimated 1 million businesses worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial hack was concerning but not historic. An attacker used a curiously specific piece of data — targeted email addresses — to break into servers and steal address books, calendars, and email. Then, as Microsoft prepared to issue a patch, a second wave hit. Tom Burt, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for security and trust, said “All of a sudden we saw hundreds a day and then that continued to escalate until we were seeing north of several thousand a day. It was a very significant and noisy escalation.” Victims included local governments, police, hospitals, Covid-19 facilities, entities in the energy and transportation sector, airports, and prisons. Security researchers estimated that China breached more than 30,000 servers in the United States and hundreds of thousands worldwide. One former national security official called the attack “massive” and said, “We’re talking thousands of servers compromised per hour, globally.” A security researcher told Wired magazine: “China just owned the world — or at least everyone with Outlook Web Access,” the researcher said. “When was the last time someone was so bold as to just hit everyone?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft publicly attributed the attack to China relatively quickly. Researchers at the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center indicated that the culprits were both known and unknown. Several known Chinese actors had been involved, along with a wide range of unknown groups apparently operating from inside China. All were using the same exploit. The attack was stunning in its scope and brazenness but was also the latest in a long line of increasingly aggressive Chinese attacks in the cyber domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines China’s cyber operations, which play an important role in political warfare. As Benjamin Jensen argues, “Cyber coercive campaigns are online political warfare. They work in an indirect and additive manner to coerce rivals and signal resolve.” Since 2014, China has hacked and stolen the data of about 80 percent of Americans. In early 2014, Beijing hacked the health insurance company Anthem and then over the next year exfiltrated an estimated 78 million names, birth dates, and social security numbers. Beijing also hacked the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in late 2014, an attack that became public in 2015, and stole 22.1 million records, including security clearance background checks. Then in 2017, Beijing hacked credit reporting agency Equifax and stole credit information for 147.9 million Americans. Between 2014 and 2018 Beijing hacked Starwood Hotels (later purchased by Marriott) and stole reservation, credit card, passport, and other travel information from an estimated 500 million people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This repeated collection of vast amounts of data means that Beijing knows more about Americans than Americans likely know about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Since 2014, China has hacked and stolen the data of about 80 percent of Americans.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this chapter shows, China has developed a robust set of capabilities in the cyber domain, complete with a revamped bureaucratic structure designed to transition seamlessly between political warfare and conflict. Attacks have intensified, mirroring the “wolf warrior diplomacy” and other increasingly assertive elements of Chinese state power. Beijing’s data theft is perhaps the best known of its endeavors, but it is only one part of China’s cyber operations. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) also uses cyber tools for intelligence collection, military operations, corporate advantage, and even personal financial gain for the operators. China almost certainly is turning a massive databank into a training field for advanced artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) systems. In addition, the Chinese government is using cyber tools to create sophisticated influence campaigns and appears poised to use cyber operations for real-world effects, including attacks that could endanger lives. China’s growing sophistication and increasing aggressiveness in its campaigns mean it can compete effectively with the United States and Russia, from penetrating defense contractors to holding critical infrastructure in the United States at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the CCP and its cyber tools are not 10 feet tall. As Chinese offensive capabilities have improved, defenses in the United States have become more focused and have been given increased resources. Government entities such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) have bolstered the security of U.S. government weak spots and raised awareness in the private sector about both the threat and the responsibility to secure one’s own systems. And China’s approach is hardly foolproof. Smoothing out the seams of the massive reorganizations within the bureaucracy from 2015 and 2018 will be challenging, just as adaptation is hard for every bureaucracy. Further, in contrast to Russia, which has hidden behind ambiguity over whether actors are criminals or state-supported or both, Beijing has been public about its attempts to bring a sprawling group of hackers under the close control of the state. The rest of the world would be justified in putting Beijing on notice that attacks emanating from Chinese territory are at the very least presumed acceptable to Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along these lines, this chapter seeks to explore a set of tools that function in the cyber domain to further the CCP’s larger foreign policy goals in the area of political warfare. There is crossover with other chapters — particularly those covering intelligence operations (Chapter 3), information and disinformation operations (Chapter 5), and economic coercion (Chapter 8) — because they are partially achieved using tools in the cyber domain. Examining cyber tools in its own chapter allows a thorough understanding of how China organizes itself to make the most out of use of these tools, from the bureaucratic structures in place to the decisions about how to focus efforts and deploy resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offensive cyber tools are programs designed to identify and exploit a vulnerability in an adversary’s networks, leading to the ability to map a network, find and extract data, damage computer systems, or potentially cause a system managed by a vulnerable network to function inappropriately, causing death or damage. Offensive cyber tools can establish a persistent presence for a wide range of uses, from information gathering to potential kinetic operations. Along that spectrum lie acts of cyber sabotage and eventually cyber warfare, which could include destruction of property or deaths of personnel. This chapter draws on Chinese strategy documents and military academic work to explore how Beijing approaches offensive cyber operations, nesting that activity under China’s larger strategy of “information warfare.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter is divided into the following sections. It reviews the creation and development of China’s cyber capability, maps the agencies and main actors responsible for China’s cyber program, and establishes China’s goals for its cyber program. Finally, it discusses the implications of China’s increasing skill set in cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-operations-a-key-element-of-information-warfare&quot;&gt;CYBER OPERATIONS: A KEY ELEMENT OF INFORMATION WARFARE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese doctrine views cyber operations as a core element of information warfare. The father of Chinese information warfare, Major General Wang Pufeng, summarized how information has become central to all aspects of warfighting in his seminal 1995 work &lt;em&gt;Information Warfare and the Revolution in Military Affairs&lt;/em&gt;. He wrote: “Information war is a crucial stage of high-tech war. . . . At its heart are information technologies, fusing intelligence war, strategic war, electronic war, guided missile war, a war of ‘motorization’ [jidong zhan], a war of firepower [huoli] — a total war. It is a new type of warfare.” Twenty years later, China’s 2015 Military Strategy spelled out the role of computer network operations, calling it a “new pillar of economic and social development” and a “new domain of national security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;网络空间是经济社会发展新支柱和国家安全新领域。网络空间国际战略竞争日趋激烈，不少国家都在发展网络空间军事力量。中国是黑客攻击最大的受害国之一，网络基础设施安全面临严峻威胁，网络空间对军事安全影响逐步上升。加快网络空间力量建设，提高网络空间态势感知、网络防御、支援国家网络空间斗争和参与国际合作的能力，遏控网络空间重大危机，保障国家网络与信息安全，维护国家安全和社会稳定。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Cyberspace has become a new pillar of economic and social development, and a new domain of national security. As international strategic competition in cyberspace has been turning increasingly fierce, quite a few countries are developing their cyber military forces. Being one of the major victims of hacker attacks, China is confronted with grave security threats to its cyber infrastructure. As cyberspace weighs more in military security, China will expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defense, support for the country’s endeavors in cyberspace and participation in international cyber cooperation, so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s strategy for information warfare developed over decades, and to implement this vision, China has established a robust cyber capability, both in-house in the security services and on a contract or volunteer basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-evolution-of-chinas-cyber-capabilities&quot;&gt;THE EVOLUTION OF CHINA’S CYBER CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s cyber program started as most others, with a group of cutting-edge hackers in a small community testing out new talents and capabilities as a side job or a hobby. In May 1999, the United States became a major target. In retaliation for the United States’ accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, “patriotic hackers” defaced U.S. government websites with messages denouncing the North American Treaty Organization. Then in August 1999, Chinese private hackers targeted 10 Taiwanese government pages and left statements saying, “There is only one China in the world and the world only needs one China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military and civilian organizations grew over time, and by the early 2010s, China was a robust and increasingly sophisticated cyber power. U.S. cybersecurity firms began to uncover the scope of Chinese activity. Between 2013 and early 2016, leading cybersecurity firm Mandiant tracked at least 72 civilian, military, and ostensibly private Chinese cyber organizations operating on the world stage. Another firm, CrowdStrike, evaluated China’s cyber posture in its 2015 Global Threat Report. It found 28 Chinese cyber groups pursuing defense and law enforcement targets and many other groups attacking targets in energy, transportation, government, technology, healthcare, finance, telecommunications, media, manufacturing, and agriculture. One such unit was People’s Liberation Army (PLA) operated Unit 61398, which has reportedly stolen terabytes of data from organizations worldwide since 2006. Mandiant identified 141 companies targeted by Unit 61398, of which 115 were in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2014, Chinese cyber activity had become widespread, aggressive, and noisy, likely in part because of the sheer number of actors engaging in cyber activity with unclear deconfliction and organization. China had three departments overseeing cyber activities: the PLA, which operated 12 specialized operation bureaus; Technical Reconnaissance Bureaus (TRB) for each military region; and the Ministry of State Security (MSS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the exact reasons for the timing are unclear, 2015 became a watershed moment for China’s cyber capabilities. Beijing appears to have decided that its cyber efforts needed better coordination and centralized control, and it embarked on a massive reorganization of its military cyber units. These efforts were likely built from Xi Jinping’s reforms launched in 2012, when he became general secretary of the CCP. At the 18th Central Committee meeting that same year, Xi told the Third Plenary that “in the face of the rapid development of Internet technology and applications, the current management system has obvious drawbacks, such as multi-management, overlapping functions, inconsistent powers and responsibilities, and efficiency.” A Xinhua article at the time compared the organization of China’s cyber operations to “water control at Kowloon,” suggesting uncontrolled growth and lack of organization, with a degree of improvisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some commentators have suggested that a summit between President Obama and President Xi in 2015 was a turning point. The United States had been increasingly vocal about its impatience with Chinese intellectual property (IP) and other data theft and had been increasing diplomatic pressure. That diplomacy culminated in a summit in Washington, D.C., in September 2015. At the summit, both powers agreed not to conduct economically motivated cyber espionage — a subset of China’s collection, but a large one. At the press conference announcing the agreement, Xi said, “China strongly opposes and combats the theft of commercial secrets and other kinds of hacking attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little evidence exists that the summit was causal. Given the timing of the rollout of a complicated reorganization in December, just a few months later, it was more likely the CCP had already planned the policy shift and used the summit as a way to win diplomatic points for a decision that was already made. Within a year of the summit, serious doubts had emerged about whether China had slowed down its cyber espionage activity, or whether it had in fact refocused its efforts. As a Council on Foreign Relations analysis concluded in 2016, Chinese entities “may be becoming more stealthy and sophisticated in their attacks,” noting that Assistant Attorney General John Carlin said China had reduced the volume of attacks but had become more focused and calculated. Leading cybersecurity researchers published papers reporting that the volume of Chinese cyberattacks on the United States had lessened, but espionage continued in particular strategically significant sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE GREAT REFOCUSING: THE CREATION OF THE PLA STRATEGIC SUPPORT FORCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s 2015 Military Strategy laid out a clear goal: “China will expedite the development of a cyber force and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defense, [and] support for the country’s endeavors in cyberspace.” In 2015, to further that goal, the PLA moved cyber capabilities from widely scattered and loosely coordinated forces into a largely coherent, centralized group within a new organization: the Strategic Support Force (SSF). SSF was created to prepare China for twenty-first century warfare, uniting most of the PLA’s cyber, space, electromagnetic, and psychological warfare capabilities under one chain of command. The SSF seeks to disrupt an adversary’s capabilities to conduct warfare, in particular by sabotaging command systems — or systems of systems — in the early stages of a conflict. Further, it seeks to create a nearly seamless transition to a war footing by creating permanent operational groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the SSF, the Network Systems Department (NSD) oversees cyber and information warfare. The reorganization pursued a “bricks, not clay” approach, which means that units were generally kept whole as the bigger structures were deconstructed and rearranged. For example, PLA Unit 69010 pre-2015 was the Lanzhou Military Region’s second TRB. In the reorganization, it was reassigned largely intact to the SSF NSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2015, Mandiant described a much more targeted effort by Chinese cyber entities associated with the PLA. They assessed that the focus for many Chinese actors shifted from IP theft to strategic intelligence collection and the establishment of persistent accesses for potential future use. The number of actors decreased precipitously as well. Mandiant reported in 2016 that they had seen a dramatic drop in cyber espionage from 72 suspected China-based groups. Mandiant researchers cited several factors, “including President Xi’s military and political initiatives, the widespread exposure of Chinese cyberoperations, and mounting pressure from the U.S. Government.” Similarly, the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology hypothesized that China was attempting to control its operatives and better focus its efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indictment five years later laid out what the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) saw as the main targets of MSS-affiliated actors, which reflect this narrower focus on strategic topics: high-tech manufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; and defense. One DOJ indictment charges the defendants with conspiring to steal trade secrets, including “technology designs, manufacturing processes, test mechanisms and results, source code, and pharmaceutical chemical structures.” There is a clear selection bias in this kind of data collection. The U.S. government only knows about the activity it has found, or that victims have reported, and such reporting is highly inconsistent. Further, the publicly available data are from only those cases the DOJ felt it had the evidence to pursue. However, the conjunction of a reorganization of China’s cyber activity and a seemingly narrower scope of targets can logically be seen as more than a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY’S EVOLUTION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the SSF looms large in China’s cyber posture, the MSS has a robust set of activities at least partially focused on the United States. Civil-military cyber integration is a core tenet of the Central Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development, which was created in January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSS undertook its own reorganization in 2018 to better focus its activities. As of 2022, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission reported that the MSS “conducts most [of China’s] global cyberespionage operations and targets political, economic, and personally identifiable information to achieve China’s strategic objectives.” Indeed, the MSS was almost certainly responsible for the Microsoft Exchange hack detailed at the beginning of this chapter. Microsoft dubbed that threat group “HAFNIUM.” Recorded Future named MSS as the actor behind APT3/GOTHIC PANDA in 2017, and Crowdstrike pointed to the MSS as the actor behind APT10/STONE PANDA in 2018. GOTHIC PANDA pursued a variety of technology and other targets in the United States until 2015, then shifted its focus to Hong Kong in 2016, likely in advance of Hong Kong’s elections. GOTHIC PANDA was also likely involved in the 2018 attack on the Winter Games in South Korea. STONE PANDA has been responsible for attacks on managed service providers and their customers to secure IP and confidential business data, including in Brazil, Canada, Sweden, India, Switzerland, Finland, Japan, Germany, France, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSS also oversees two civilian agencies: the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations and the China Information Technology Security Evaluation Center. The former ostensibly acts as a think tank, carrying out track 1.5 dialogues and engaging in discussions about cyber norms with European and U.S. think tanks. The latter collects information about vulnerabilities in software and hardware products, which it likely passes along to the MSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another civilian agency, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), is the central internet regulator and primary control, oversight, and censor agency of the country. While the relationship between the MSS and CAC is not clear from publicly available documents, they likely at least share information. In October 2017, the CAC released a key policy document highlighting the CCP’s perspectives on cyberspace ahead of the National Congress. The document included a directive to “promote the deepened development of military-civilian integration for cybersecurity and informatization,” which prompted the PLA to strengthen its partnerships with the civilian sector, notably giants such as Huawei and ZTE. Following the 2018 round of governmental reform, the CAC was elevated to the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF PRIVATE AND SEMI-PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has a further, expansive set of ostensibly private or semi-private organizations working on the cybersecurity mission. For example, the National Cybersecurity Center (NCC), formerly the National Cybersecurity Talent and Innovation Base, lies at the heart of realizing China’s ambition to become a cyber powerhouse. The new center has been under construction since 2017 in Wuhan and houses multiple research and talent centers, laboratories, and an operational national cybersecurity school. The NCC’s two non-private laboratories, the Combined Cybersecurity Research Institute and the Offense-Defense Lab, both perform cybersecurity research for the Chinese government. Under civil-military fusion, the NCC has established links to the PLA so that the military can harness the new research and tools being developed in their asymmetric operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is the Central Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development, which was established in December 2017. The center, which currently operates within one of China’s premier cybersecurity companies, 360 Enterprise Security Group, is charged with enhancing private sector cooperation to help ensure the military wins future cyber wars. Other examples of national agencies include the China National Cyber Threat Intelligence Collaboration (CNTIC), established in 2017 by government agencies and leading cybersecurity companies, and the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team, which supports the CNTIC. Both are defensively oriented, with a mission to collect cyber threat data, analyze it, and share it among national elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the CCP’s military and civilian agencies are likely to employ a large hacking community to conduct offensive cyber operations. Before the 2015 reorganization, one theory of China’s cyber activity suggested intelligence officers loosely oversaw an unstructured cluster of patriotic hackers. Since these groups could undermine the more political objectives of regular PLA cyber units if allowed to operate unrestrained, they were likely tasked with surveillance and espionage only rather than offensive cyber operations that would target critical infrastructure or cause physical damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to state-affiliated hackers, a group of cyber volunteers called “hacktivists” operates independently. These web-based communities are layered by several interest groups, such as malware tool developers, legitimate security researchers, and novices seeking training. These groups have engaged in large-scale politically motivated denial-of-service attacks, web defacement of foreign networks, and data destruction — activities that fall under “hacktivism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSS continues to empower its hacker community by hiring them as contractors to launch offensive cyber activities against foreign actors — including the United States — to steal trade secrets and exfiltrate data. DOJ indictments link the MSS to private contractors for cyber espionage activity. For example, one such indictment alleges that Ding Xiaoyang, Chen Qingmin, and Zhu Yunmin were Hainan State Security Department officers “responsible for coordinating, facilitating, and managing hackers at MSS front companies.” In 2007 and 2008, the First Research Institute of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), which supports the operational elements of the MPS, posted information security and programming job vacancies on EvilOctal.com and XFOcus.net, two of the largest and most established hacker communities in China. This action demonstrates the government’s efforts to recruit from the hacker community and likely build consulting relationships. The founding member of Chinese hacker group Javaphile, who led attacks on the White House in 2001, maintains a formal consulting relationship with the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and also possesses researcher credentials at the information security engineering institute of a leading Chinese university. As the U.S.-China Commission reported:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s cybersecurity legislation weaponizes the country’s cybersecurity industry and research by requiring companies and researchers to submit all discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities to the government before providing them to the vendors that can patch them. This policy, leveraged in combination with domestic hacking competitions and cooperative agreements with Chinese universities, provides China’s security services with a steady stream of vulnerabilities to exploit for state-sponsored operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the same evolution that most nation-state cyber efforts experienced from the 1990s through today, China’s cyber structures have undergone rapid and comprehensive reform in two bouts, in 2015 and 2018. As of 2023, the rapid reform efforts seem to have concluded, leaving the hard work of creating new internal norms, sharing practices, and developing bureaucratic fixes to new processes. While any new bureaucracy takes time to form and smooth out practices across new silos, it is likely that these reforms will largely accomplish the intended goal of centralizing decisionmaking and gaining stronger command and control over cyber efforts, given the new decisionmaking structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-goals-of-offensive-cyber-operations&quot;&gt;THE GOALS OF OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese actors pursue activity in the cyber domain for three main reasons. The first is to steal secrets about adversary intent or capability. The second reason is to establish access points for disruption or pre-positioned destructive tools for conflict contingencies. The third reason is to help Chinese businesses leapfrog their Western competition or to enable personal financial gain. To identify these three main goals and assess the weight of each line of effort, CSIS researchers created a dataset of Chinese cyber operations from 2010 to 2022, examining 49 major incidents that were publicly reported and credibly attributed to the Chinese government. While the data is imperfect — some incidents reported as one campaign had several sub-components, and other incidents have imprecise details — there are some preliminary trends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twelve of the major attacks were directed at a government entity, including several U.S. state governments in 2022;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An estimated 12 of these incidents involved an attack on a defense entity, including the U.S. Navy and aerospace contractors in 2018;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eight were upstream attacks where hackers breached a service provider that would in turn provide access to other potential targets. For example, one attack encompassed hacks of 13 telecom networks beginning in 2016;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In more than half of the incidents, Chinese actors sought to steal industrial secrets, IP, or sensitive government data; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least three of the attacks could be characterized as operational preparation of the environment, where the Chinese hackers sought vulnerabilities in U.S. and Australian government systems and in oil and gas infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limited dataset makes drawing conclusions about trend lines in types of attacks risky, but the variety of targets is noteworthy, as is the focus on stealing information. One cluster is worth highlighting: a series of attacks on defense contractors in 2018 and 2019, corresponding with MSS reorganization. This cluster of attacks suggests that a concerted effort to go after defense secrets corresponded with a refocusing of MSS activities in the reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these reasons could encompass potentially dangerous and escalatory activity, but they are well in line with what other nations attempt. Under the goal of espionage, the hallmark of Chinese activity is the quantity of data stolen and the diversity of the target set. This practice reveals a secondary strategic goal: a likely attempt to create and train a world-class AI/ML capability. The most worrisome of the three goals is China’s ability to create kinetic effects, including potential destruction of critical infrastructure, a problem set discussed below in more detail. The next section explores each of the three goals in more depth: espionage, operations, and financial motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-tools-for-espionage&quot;&gt;CYBER TOOLS FOR ESPIONAGE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most nation-states, China has worked to create a cyber operations capability to collect information on its adversaries. Those activities include normal nation-state goals, such as attempting to discern intentions. For example, in 2008 entities linked to the Chinese government broke into the campaigns of both Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama to gain insight into each potential administration’s China policy. One item apparently stolen was a draft letter from McCain to the newly elected president of Taiwan, in which McCain pledged his support for the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. But before the McCain staff finalized the letter, the Chinese embassy called to complain. Randall Scriver, then serving as a McCain campaign aide, was thoroughly surprised by the call. He said, “It certainly struck me as odd that they would be so well-informed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s efforts have spanned political and military targets, with a focus on defense contractors. China attempted to break into TRANSCOM systems about 50 times between 2012 and 2013, with 20 of those attacks successful. A Senate Armed Services Committee investigation found that TRANSCOM was only aware of two of those intrusions. From 2007 to 2009, Chinese hackers broke into defense contractors responsible for building the F-35 fighter and stole information about the design and electronics systems. At the same time, attackers accessed the U.S. Air Force’s air traffic control system, which showed the locations of U.S. military aircraft in flight. In early 2018, a Naval Undersea Warfare Centre contractor lost signals and sensor data, cryptographic information related to communications, and the submarine development unit’s electronic warfare library. Two China-linked advanced persistent threats (APTs) even targeted universities engaged in naval research with military applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has also worked to develop a robust offensive counterintelligence capability for both tactical and strategic purposes, some of which is discussed in Chapter 3. In advance of a Chinese official’s visit to an unnamed country, an APT stole local call records and the guest list at his hotel, suggesting a security sweep. On a strategic level, the massive data breaches of OPM in 2015, in which the data of an estimated 22.1 million people was stolen, and Starwood/Marriott hotels, in which the data of an estimated 500 million guests was stolen, might show which Americans with security clearances travelled where and when, potentially exposing sensitive military or intelligence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OPERATIONAL PREPARATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An eye-popping headline about a massive breach makes the operation seem sudden, but computer network operations usually require months of preparation. Operators must research vulnerabilities, create a tool, find a way into the target, and map the target’s network, all before data extraction or kinetic effects. As a result, China has put significant effort into operational preparation of the environment (OPE): identifying vulnerabilities and establishing access points for future exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a prominent Chinese defense journal, &lt;em&gt;Guofang Keji&lt;/em&gt;, scholars highlighted the importance of this kind of reconnaissance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cyberspace reconnaissance operations are mission behaviors to obtain information about opponents or potential opponents’ cyberspace operations and network resources. The network information of reconnaissance is the prerequisite basis for all cyber combat operations and can also be used to verify current intelligence or predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors describe two types of attacks. The first is “information utilization,” or “soft kill” attacks; the second is “high-precision physical destruction of hardware,” such as information technology infrastructure. These forms of attack have the benefits of “remote control, flexible maneuverability, strong destructive power, and small collateral damage. It is also a basic means of network warfare.” OPE is necessary for precision and effectiveness in both types of attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The danger of OPE, however, is that the tactics, tools, and procedures look similar — if not identical — to activity designed to destroy or disable an adversary’s capabilities. As a result, the target may not be able to tell whether the activity is designed to steal information or cause destruction. The escalatory implications of this dynamic have yet to be tested in a real-world, high-tension situation. However, Chinese scholars have identified the potential for problems: “Active cyber reconnaissance can mislead opponents into believing that cyber combat operations have begun, prompting them to be exposed as soon as possible, so as to achieve better reconnaissance results. Therefore, the cyber reconnaissance capability is the primary core capability of the cyberspace support force construction.” They seem to suggest this activity is not to be taken lightly, which may help Western nations to persuade Beijing to adopt international norms about state behavior. China’s OPE includes recruiting routers and networks for potential future operations. In October, the National Security Agency (NSA), CISA, and the FBI issued a cybersecurity advisory warning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chinese hacking groups have exploited publicly known vulnerabilities to breach anything from unpatched small office/home office (SOHO) routers to medium and even large enterprise networks. Once compromised, the threat actors used the devices as part of their own attack infrastructure as command-and-control servers and proxy systems they could use to breach more networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, considerable amounts of Chinese cyber activities have been devoted to penetrating telecoms. These access points are force multipliers for intelligence services because an upstream attack on a telecommunications company can provide access to a host of additional targets — including all the customers of that telecommunications company. A researcher at Michigan State University found that penetrating the telecommunication sector had become the number one Chinese cyber espionage focus as of 2021, above even government targets. He wrote: “The versatility offered by telecommunications targeting combined with the more efficient and stealthier methods used is believed to indicate a higher level of maturity among active Chinese APTs.” In 2022, Chinese hackers went after Middle Eastern telecoms, using keylogger and PowerShell scripts designed to gather email content. The threat group, known as BackDoorDiplomacy, had been targeting diplomatic entities and telecommunications companies in Africa and the Middle East since at least 2017 — an apparent shift from its early government-focused efforts starting in 2010. A joint cybersecurity advisory in June 2022 from NSA, CISA, and the FBI outlined how Chinese actors compromise major telecommunications companies and network service providers, noting “they establish a broad network of compromised infrastructure and use the network to exploit a wide variety of targets worldwide.” As another assessment concludes, “Telecommunication firms are extremely high-value targets for intelligence agencies. . . . Successfully hacking them can mean opening doors to an even bigger world of prized spying opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI TRAINING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After China’s first big data breaches, some commentators wondered how it might make so much data usable. William Evanina, former director of the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center, described China as “shop-vac oriented,” referring to the vast quantities of apparently non-differentiated information pulled into Beijing’s control between 2015 and 2018. The leading theory among security researchers on the purpose of that data collection effort is based on China’s stated intent to create a world-leading AI/ML capability. Data holdings from these entities were probably already structured, making it easier to use them to train AI algorithms. Further, U.S. data sets are likely more diverse than Chinese data sets, making them much better training data for AI/ML systems. The Anthem hack, which gave Beijing 78 million customer records, likely provided useful information on medical conditions and treatment plans that could further China’s biotech and pharmacological efforts. These data sets have the added benefit of providing insight potentially useful for future influence operations. In another example, TikTok’s data-gathering capability reveals what media Americans find most engaging and what kinds of messages are most effective, which enables China to develop compelling messages that serve China’s larger interests. TikTok, which is also discussed in Chapter 5, could be both an effective research tool and an efficient delivery mechanism for messages promoting China’s view of state surveillance and Taiwan as part of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-tools-for-operations-information-operations-disruption-and-kinetic-effects&quot;&gt;CYBER TOOLS FOR OPERATIONS: INFORMATION OPERATIONS, DISRUPTION, AND KINETIC EFFECTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cyber domain has proven fruitful for collecting information and for conducting a range of other operations, from creating access for information operations to disrupting adversary plans and causing physical damage. China has become a premier player in information operations, in line with their stated strategies, and cyber tools have facilitated some of those propaganda campaigns. Cyber operations can also harass or disrupt an adversary — increasing friction of decisionmaking in a crisis, making communication challenging, or blocking access to important data. Finally, cyber operations can cause physical harm, for example, if a cyber tool is used to break equipment, cause a fire, or take a hospital offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section explores this set of operations and what is known about Chinese capabilities. Thebroader goals and capabilities in the information operations space are discussed in Chapter 5, but this section deals with cyber operations that create accesses or collect information that can later be used to shape ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CYBER OPERATIONS TO ENABLE INFORMATION OPERATIONS: ACCESS TO MEDIA AND ELECTION SYSTEMS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information operations contain a broad bucket of activity, including efforts to shape an adversary’s view of a conflict or potential conflict or efforts to weaken an adversary from within. Information operations take place in multiple ways with many tools, but increasingly they are executed in the cyber domain through social media or using tools such as deepfakes. This section briefly touches on using the cyber domain not just for spreading information payloads but for accessing force multipliers for information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber actors seek unauthorized access to websites, media outlets, or election systems in order to spread information payloads seemingly from inside the system or to disrupt operations. For example, China’s first recorded cyber operation against the United States was an information operation: the 1999 defacement of U.S. government websites with messages denouncing NATO in retaliation for the United States’ accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is increasing its attacks on the media and entertainment sector, with an estimated 75 percent of China’s media targets based in the Asia-Pacific. In 2013, Beijing-linked hackers retaliated against the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; after both newspapers published articles alleging that the Chinese prime minister’s family had accumulated tremendous wealth. Nearly a decade later, Mandiant uncovered that hackers linked to the Chinese government had compromised email accounts at the Wall Street Journal and maintained a presence on their systems for at least two years, from 2020 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While election influence is attempting to influence voters’ minds to vote a certain way, or not to vote at all, interference is an attempt to disrupt the election systems themselves. This disruption can occur by deleting voter information so that voters cannot check in at a polling station or spreading misinformation about where, when, or how to vote in order to prevent people from voting. In 2022, China conducted operations that may have been aimed at election interference. China exploited the “log4j” vulnerability — a critical flaw in a widely used logging tool — and zero-day vulnerabilities to gain access to at least six state governments, and probably more. One ingress route was through an application called USAHerds, which U.S. states use to detect and track livestock disease outbreaks. China has previously also shown interest in stealing IP related to U.S. agriculture, suggesting cyber operators may have used an older access point to pivot to a new use — election interference. Separately, NSA issued a warning in 2022 that Chinese hackers scanned more than 100 state-level political party domains “likely so the PRC cyber actor could build a target network for possible future operations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DISRUPTION AND KINETIC EFFECTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it does not appear that China has attempted kinetic operations in the cyber domain, Chinese military theory acknowledges the possibility. The Chinese military has also endeavored to find gaps in the defenses of critical infrastructure. Writing in &lt;em&gt;Guofang Keji&lt;/em&gt;, several Chinese military scholars noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The physical level requires the realization of the vertical and horizontal connection and integration of various combat units and combat elements, unified command, unified control and unified coordination. The information level requires the controllability, sharing, and robustness of command information. The above-mentioned command and control capabilities play a decisive role in the control of cyberspace and the success or failure of operations, so they have become one of the core capabilities of cyberspace combat power construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FBI and CISA have warned of long-standing Chinese efforts to identify gaps in the security of critical infrastructure such as oil and gas systems. CISA recently revealed details about Chinese attacks on oil and gas companies from 2011 to 2013. China has targeted at least 23 natural gas pipelines with spearphishing emails. Of these, 13 were confirmed compromises, 3 were “near misses,” and 8 intrusions were successful but of unknown severity. FBI and CISA assessed that Chinese government actors were seeking the ability to hold pipeline infrastructure at risk in order to potentially physically damage pipelines or disrupt operations. Mandiant confirmed that this line of effort is a persistent one for Beijing. Multiple threat actors tied to China have targeted industrial control systems (ICSs), including “an energy company, multiple natural gas pipeline companies, an ICS equipment manufacturer, and an ICS security firm.” Mandiant also identified the “Pulse Attacks,” which exploited a weakness in a software system called Pulse Secure, which allows people to work remotely. Chinese entities used the vulnerability to target the U.S. government and critical infrastructure, including the country’s largest water agency, the New York City subway system, and Verizon. A security researcher called it a targeted attack against a few dozen networks that all have national significance in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to critical infrastructure systems is one thing; use of that access is another. China’s intentions are still unclear. China may be exploring vulnerabilities to identify what kind of disruptive effects are possible, or it could hope for a deterrent effect, betting that the U.S. government will identify the activity. It could also be collecting accesses as OPE or contingency plans in case of conflict. The ODNI in its 2021 annual threat assessment warned that China can, “at a minimum” bring “temporary and localized” disruptions to U.S. critical infrastructure through cyberattacks. In 2022, the annual threat assessment went even further, saying “China almost certainly is capable of launching cyberattacks that would disrupt critical infrastructure services within the United States, including against oil and gas pipelines and rail systems.” Both were silent on intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-tools-for-financial-gain&quot;&gt;CYBER TOOLS FOR FINANCIAL GAIN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government approaches public-private partnerships in a far different way than most Western governments. Beijing can and does compel businesses to cooperate with state priorities whether or not the outcome is helpful to the company’s bottom line. Beijing has also used state resources to advance the business interests of purportedly private entities. Cyber operations have long played a role in China’s larger strategy of IP theft to leap ahead of competitors. According to at least one assessment, China has stolen more secrets from businesses and governments than any other country. In 2011, China breached the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to such an extent that even the thermostats were communicating with a computer in China and a printer began printing in Chinese. In 2012, General Keith Alexander, then head of NSA, described cyber-enabled economic espionage as “the greatest transfer of wealth in history.” The economic loss to the United States alone is often estimated at $30–600 billion annually. Industrial and economic espionage tends to track with China’s five-year economic development plans. The Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology assessed that “most of the technology needed to realize the 13th five-year plan will likely be acquired by stealing trade secrets from companies in other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FBI has been working to raise public awareness about this threat and to encourage businesses to better secure their systems. In 2018, then deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein said, “More than 90 percent of the department’s cases alleging economic espionage over the past seven years involve China and more than two-thirds of the department’s cases involving thefts of trade secrets are connected to China.” Rosenstein explicitly tied several of these crimes back to the MSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-scale industrial hacking for research and development helps Chinese industry, but individual or small groups of hackers also moonlight for their own personal financial gain. China’s cadres of contractor hackers have been known to pursue both goals. For example, APT41, also known as BARIUM or WICKED PANDA, has used the same malware for espionage and also for financially motivated activity, largely directed at the video game industry. Mandiant wrote in their groundbreaking paper on APT41 that while purely financial goals are unusual among Chinese state-sponsored groups, “evidence suggests APT41 has conducted simultaneous cyber crime and cyber espionage operations from 2014 onward.” The DOJ indicted seven alleged members of APT41 in 2020 and tied them to a contractor known as Chengdu 404, who has worked for the MSS. The DOJ cited espionage on behalf of the MSS and cybercrime in the indictment. While little information exists on the extent to which government authorities condone or support such activity, condemnation by the government would almost certainly result in cessation of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;ATTRIBUTION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing clear standards for attribution, along with confidence levels for those standards, will be important for reacting to Chinese cyber activity quickly. Standards for attribution are different in the private sector than in the intelligence community, resulting in an occasional mismatch where a private researcher attempting to make headlines is willing to be forward leaning in an assessment, but the intelligence community disagrees or expresses uncertainty. That mismatch can make the U.S. government look indecisive and vulnerable. Policymakers should fully understand the intelligence community’s attribution standards and be ready to publicly explain their posture regarding investigating an attack. They should also be prepared to act in the face of some uncertainty. Perfect knowledge is an unrealistic standard in war and intelligence work, and the cyber domain is no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mandiant’s 2013 report &lt;em&gt;APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units&lt;/em&gt; was one of the first and still most high-profile cases of public attribution of a cyberattack to the Chinese government. The report traced APT1’s activity back to Shanghai and identified the group as the Second Bureau of the PLA General Staff Department’s Third Department, also known as Unit 61398. A year later, the DOJ indicted five Chinese army officials for engaging in the economic espionage exposed in the Mandiant report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indictments are rare in comparison to the scope of Chinese hacking activity, but DOJ has pursued charges several times in the last five years. In 2021, the United States charged four Chinese nationals in a global hacking campaign that targeted dozens of U.S. companies, universities, and government agencies in the United States and abroad. In December 2018, the DOJ indicted two Chinese hackers from the MSS-affiliated group APT10, who infiltrated U.S. Navy contractors’ systems to steal ship maintenance data and missile plans. Earlier the same year, the DOJ indicted MSS officers and hackers who had conspired over several years to steal commercial aviation and technological data from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases where the CCP has responded to public attribution of cyberattacks, there has always been strict denial and often condemnation of what the CCP describes as efforts to intentionally tarnish China’s reputation. In 2013, the Obama administration publicly and directly accused China’s military of conducting cyber operations against U.S. defense contractors and network systems. The Pentagon’s annual report to Congress stated, “computer systems . . . owned by the U.S. government continued to be targeted for intrusions, some of which appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military.” In response, the CCP condemned the report, instead claiming that China is against all forms of cyberattacks and is open to conversing with the United States on internet security. After a Chinese threat actor was suspected of infiltrating the networks of Afghan telecommunications providers in 2020 and 2021, a Chinese embassy spokesperson said, “Linking cyber attacks directly to one certain government is a highly sensitive political issue. China hopes that relevant parties will adopt a professional and responsible attitude.” Xinhua News Agency, China’s official state news agency, described the West’s attributions as slander and instead argued that “the United States, posing a grave threat to global cybersecurity, is commanding the allies it spies on to slander China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Crowdstrike declared that China surpassed Russia as the most prolific nation-state mounting attacks on Western entities. At the time, China was shifting its targets from largely commercial secrets to strategically targeted collection. Since 2018, Beijing has cemented its cyber strategy, developed its capabilities, and cultivated a certain boldness in its operations that reflects its larger posture toward the world and increased use of political warfare. As highlighted in Chapter 8, projects such as the Digital Silk Road have embedded Chinese communications equipment in systems around the globe, potentially making access for the purposes of both surveillance and control quite easy. U.S. businesses have increasingly become aware of the threat from China to their IP and realized they are a target, but Chinese offensive capabilities are expanding just as defense is improving. The future will need to include layered defense and a mindset of unity of effort, whereby businesses see the incentive for sharing information about attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these tremendous advances, China still suffers from several weaknesses, and its vulnerabilities are exploitable. Beijing’s cyber cadre is generally composed of fast followers, meaning they copy other approaches. For example, China seemed to copycat some of Russia’s influence tactics after 2016, but slowly. U.S. policymakers were already on the lookout for similar tactics, making China’s activity more easily identifiable. Likewise, businesses are aware of the threat and are shoring up defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s centralized approach could be an additional weakness. Xi’s attempt to exert more centralized control over cyber operations will lead to more unity of effort and less rogue or vigilante activity. However, approvals for actions likely would need to run through official processes, dramatically reducing agility and limiting opportunistic action. Decisions made by committee also tend to squelch more innovative approaches. Further, the CCP has hardly demonstrated an appetite for risk, and the reorganization was likely in part to limit the chances that an unapproved operation went forward. U.S. policymakers could build on this concern and make clear that Beijing will be held responsible for operations emanating from its territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for exploitable vulnerabilities, China has several. The financial motivation of some of their top hacking talent could be used against them, in particular if their freelancing has attracted the ire of Chinese leadership. Hackers in trouble could be encouraged to defect, bringing valuable knowledge of Chinese cyber operations and adding to the United States’ pool of talent. Chinese scholars have also admitted in journal articles that the CCP does not truly understand its own defensive posture or its own gaps. Beijing remains concerned about the West’s capabilities. Their new structure and goal of jointness have not been tested, so the capability of running joint operations with a cyber overlay is still theoretical. Finally, the more China seeks to protect its hacking cadre from the outside world, the more stovepiped they will become as well as less knowledgeable about tactics, techniques, and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;information-and-disinformation-operations&quot;&gt;INFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION OPERATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will accelerate the development of China’s discourse and narrative systems, better tell China’s stories, make China’s voice heard, and present a China that is credible, appealing, and respectable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-xi-jinping-2&quot;&gt;– Xi Jinping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This chapter examines Chinese information and disinformation operations, an important component of political warfare.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As Thomas Rid argues in his study of political warfare during the Cold War:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At-scale disinformation campaigns are attacks against a liberal epistemic order, or a political system that places its trust in essential custodians of factual authority. These institutions — law enforcement and the criminal justice system, public administration, empirical science, investigative journalism democratically control intelligence agencies — prize facts over feelings, evidence over emotion, observations over opinion. . . . Disinformation operations, in essence, erode the very foundation of open societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China views the information environment as central to its internal stability, as a key domain through which to compete with the United States, and as a core element of its military strategy across the entire spectrum of warfare and competition. While several other chapters touch on influence in various ways — including those that deal with intelligence operations, cyber operations, the united front, and economic coercion — this chapter provides the most in-depth analysis of Chinese information and disinformation efforts. As used here, disinformation includes false information that is deliberately intended to mislead an audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter finds that Xi Jinping has prioritized the central role of information and disinformation operations in China’s global strategy. Speaking at the 20th Party Congress in October 2022, for example, Xi said: “We will accelerate the development of China’s discourse and narrative systems, better tell China’s stories, make China’s voice heard, and present a China that is credible, appealing, and respectable.” Xi used his platform at the 20th National Congress to promote the narrative that Beijing must bolster its “international discourse power” (国际话语权) to exert the influence that a nation of its political, economic, and military strength is entitled to on the global stage. Accordingly, China makes extensive use of information and disinformation that promote bias and misleading information to publicize and advance its international political agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter is divided into four sections. First, it examines Chinese public diplomacy. Second, it analyzes Chinese media — including social media — overseas. Third, it assesses lawful political influence and information activities. Fourth, it concludes by highlighting some of the main trends in Chinese information and disinformation operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-public-diplomacy&quot;&gt;CHINESE PUBLIC DIPLOMACY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s official representatives amplify key messaging themes that China employs to promote its interests abroad by leveraging various public diplomacy mechanisms, including speeches, articles, social media, and foreign broadcast engagements. These activities exist at the lowest end of the spectrum of aggression of Chinese information and disinformation operations. Their connection to the state, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and increasingly Xi Jinping’s vision of China’s role in global affairs is almost entirely overt. In many respects, Beijing’s public diplomacy practices are consistent with routine state behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China uses two mechanisms to execute its public diplomacy strategy. The first is a wide body of highly positive messaging designed to promote and advance China’s narrative about building alternative models for global governance untethered from the post-war Anglocentric “rules-based order.” These activities directly reflect Xi’s guidance to “tell China’s story well” (讲好中国故事) and to bolster the country’s “international discourse power” (国际话语权). This positivist messaging is complemented by the more confrontational, antagonistic approach of China’s “wolf warrior” diplomats. If Beijing’s positivist messaging is intended to promote China’s efforts to “guide reforms of the global governance system with the principle of fairness and justice,” then the purpose of the more confrontational approach is to point out the hypocrisies and contradictions in the existing world order that justify a power shift away from the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore the dynamics of both the positivist and negativist elements of Chinese public diplomacy, CSIS compiled and analyzed two datasets. First, the team analyzed Chinese speeches and articles, including those by Xi Jinping, from such sources as CSIS’s &lt;em&gt;Interpret: China&lt;/em&gt; library. Second, the team scraped and analyzed the tweets of prominent CCP spokespersons. Together, these sources enable the research team to identify and analyze key themes in China’s messaging and consider China’s two contrasting but complimentary approaches to public diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-positivist-approach&quot;&gt;THE POSITIVIST APPROACH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s positivist messaging is designed to promote positive narratives about China’s strategy, policy, and intentions. Xi Jinping and other CCP leaders frequently tout China’s accomplishments and describe China, and more specifically the CCP, as a benevolent force for good in the world. For example, in his keynote address at the CCP and World Political Parties Summit, Xi described the achievements and ambitions of the CCP:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Working for the people’s wellbeing has been the original aspiration the Chinese Communist Party cherishes all the way. With the goal of moderate prosperity in all respects achieved, China has embarked on a new journey towards building a modern socialist country. The Chinese people are brimming with a greater sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security with each passing day. It is the unswerving goal of the CCP to run our own house well, ensure a happy life for the 1.4 billion plus Chinese people, and advance the lofty cause of promoting peace and development of all mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-wolf-warrior-approach&quot;&gt;THE WOLF WARRIOR APPROACH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Xi Jinping, China’s public diplomacy is increasingly designed not only to elevate China but to discredit and ultimately displace the United States and its allies. This “wolf warrior” style of diplomacy consists of an assertiveness by Chinese government officials that embraces confrontation, denounces criticism, and emphasizes perceived hypocrisy. In the body of foreign policy speeches compiled by CSIS, one of the most common phrases identified is the term “true multilateralism” (真正的多边主义). The phrase was used frequently — appearing 52 times in the 80 speeches analyzed — and also appeared in an extraordinarily diverse range of contexts. In 2022 alone, this included high-level Chinese government remarks to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the G20, the Munich Security Conference, and the UN Climate Change Conference. Despite serving as a cornerstone of Chinese public messaging about China’s views on the nature of the international system, the phrase is rarely contextualized or further defined. Instead, it has become a shorthand in Chinese public remarks and writings to criticize U.S. initiatives that China classifies as exclusionary and pursued to sustain Washington’s interests. The use of oblique and euphemistic terminology in high-profile multilateral settings is not uncommon in the speeches analyzed by CSIS. Often wrapped in messages about China’s positivist and inclusive vision of global leadership are phrases accusing Washington of maintaining a “Cold War mentality” or pursuing a “new Cold War.” These accusations are particularly common in the area of technology policy, where Xi Jinping and others have alleged that the United States is pursuing “parallel systems” or building “exclusive yards with high walls” (小院高墙).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also applies its wolf warrior approach to shape international narratives on various items that Beijing classifies as “domestic affairs,” including the matters of Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, maritime issues, and other human rights topics. These efforts portray international condemnation of China’s human rights record as hypocritical and driven by actors with “ulterior motives” while putting forth alternative perspectives on issues such as Xinjiang and Hong Kong. Chinese leaders repeatedly argue that “Xinjiang’s door is open, and we welcome people from all over the world who harbor no bias to come to Xinjiang for visits and exchanges,” and that “Hong Kong residents enjoy far more rights and freedoms according to law than under British colonial rule.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amplification of messages issued by China’s senior leaders serves as a crucial step in the country’s broader approach to propaganda. The key themes that party leadership repeatedly emphasize in their remarks are embraced and repackaged by a wide range of official and quasi-official state and party actors and media outlets, often in increasingly negative and aggressive forms. This is perhaps most evident in the ways that China’s diplomats exploit social media and other platforms to seed confrontational rhetoric about the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent practitioners of this type of rhetorical escalation is Zhao Lijian, a former deputy director general and official spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)’ Information Department. Zhao maintains an active presence on Twitter, with nearly two million followers, where he frequently uses his account to amplify anti-Western rhetoric and to propagate various conspiracy theories. For example, in tweets since April 2022, he has suggested that Covid-19 originated in a U.S. biological laboratory, that a biological accident caused the 2022 monkey pox outbreak in the United States, and that the United States was developing biological weapons at laboratories in Ukraine. Zhao often uses Twitter as an English-language venue to question the legitimacy of U.S. democracy and to challenge the authority of the United States to serve as — in his words — a “self-claimed ‘human rights lecturer.’” Zhao contrasts confrontational posts about topics such as school shootings in the United States, the murder of George Floyd, U.S. wars in the developing world, and U.S. “democrazy” with highly positive tweets about China’s relationship with the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhao’s two most viral tweets of 2022 were posts of memes depicting the destruction associated with various post-World War II U.S. military operations. In 2021, Xinhua — the official state news agency of the CCP — released a short video titled “Ameri-cracy.” The video purports to be a children’s song, but it levels a barrage of accusations against the United States, claiming that the United States seeks to subjugate the world with its own version of destructive democracy. Set to the tune of “the Wellerman,” a New Zealand sea ballad that gained notoriety on TikTok last year, the song alleges bad behavior by the United States, from military adventurism to election fraud, with lines such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inside of the country, money talks. All policies submit to the corp[oration.] Disinformation, Gerrymandering skew election results. Trillions of dollars burned on wars yet lack money for the sick and poor; Play human rights cop across the world yet backyard you ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the video, the main singer is surrounded by four animals, which represent nations that the United States has imposed so-called “Ameri-cracy” on: Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, and the nations that saw “chaos” during the Arab Spring protests. The host interviews each of the animals at the beginning of the video about how the United States imposed this false system of democracy, thereby harming each nation. The main message is that everyone should be able to choose their own system of governance, as illustrated by the refrain: “Democracy of our own, reflects our culture, will and soul. If your system can cure all, why did it cause so many woes?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another short video geared toward a younger audience also highlights Chinese propaganda. “Once upon a virus,” released by Xinhua, features a Lego terracotta warrior warning the United States early and often about the seriousness of the pandemic. A Lego Statue of Liberty replies with nonsensical statements and denial, then blames China, in a clear satire on the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, Beijing’s wolf warrior diplomacy is designed to characterize China’s competitors as rank hypocrites in their approach to human rights and support for the developing world. The intensely negative messaging creates more space for efforts to tell China’s story and promote Beijing’s claim to building an alternative model for global governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although public diplomacy is the most overt manifestation of Chinese propaganda, it is also enabled by semi-transparent elements. Chinese public diplomacy frequently relies on amplifying articles in Chinese state media to lend further legitimacy to its claims. During the last 100 days of 2022, nearly 20 percent of all of Zhao’s tweets were links to articles written by a single commentator on international affairs. This “commentator” reliably posts opinion articles on Chinese state media to comment on U.S. domestic issues, including alleged partisanship in the U.S. Supreme Court, the “Twitter Files,” and the origins of Covid-19. The author’s name is “Xin Ping.” Although he has a Gmail address, there is little evidence beyond the dozens of English-language articles and the favor of Zhao Lijian to suggest Xin Ping is a real person rather than a pen name used for generating and amplifying Chinese state messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolf warrior diplomats circulate these types of articles widely online to help create the image of robust support. Upon inspection, one may fail to notice the source of the information and risk lending credence to Chinese propaganda. For example, at a committee hearing on February 28, 2023, U.S. representative Matt Gaetz cited unsubstantiated information from a &lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt; article without apparent knowledge of the source’s ties to the CCP. In 2020, the &lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt; was designated as a “foreign mission” by the U.S. State Department for its adherence to promoting the interests of the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in tandem, China’s positivist and wolf warrior public diplomacy approaches are essential in setting the direction of the CCP’s propaganda strategy. The themes and messages crafted by political leadership in the CCP inform activities explored in the rest of this chapter. In addition, China’s propaganda efforts begin to shift from routine statecraft to public manipulation in the creation and control of media abroad. China employs three strategies to spread propaganda and control messaging about issues related to China in information environments overseas. First, China creates new media platforms in overseas markets, exercising control over the content, with varying levels of transparency. Second, it uses existing media platforms in foreign countries to promote its messaging through paid advertisements and content that often provide limited transparency to their Chinese origin. Third, China leverages access to its domestic market to aggressively censor foreign media and information ecosystems. Combined, these three strategies enable China to further spread propaganda and often hide its manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-media-platforms&quot;&gt;NEW MEDIA PLATFORMS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s growing influence in global information environments is partly a result of its expanded creation of Chinese-owned media platforms. This section explores China’s gains in the areas of television and social media. In recent years, the most significant example of China’s expanding media prowess has been the creation and proliferation of the social media platform TikTok. The idea for TikTok began as a domestic Chinese video sharing app. ByteDance, its parent company, then reinvented the app for a worldwide audience. The United States is its largest market, including a multiyear marketing deal with the National Football League. TikTok’s business model is to provide the users with a never-ending stream of short, fun videos. The user does not curate their own feed with likes or other active feedback. Rather the app monitors whether a user lingers on a video or passes it by and collects detailed information on the user’s behavior surrounding a video. Its proprietary algorithm then feeds that user more content designed to maximize engagement with the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through these feedback loops and logging user activity, TikTok gathers significant amounts of information about a huge number of users, allowing anyone with access to the data to construct not only broad facts about the user base but also highly detailed profiles about specific users. TikTok collects so much data on users that U.S. officials have gone so far as to characterize it as a foreign surveillance tool. As a result of its popularity and data collection capabilities, TikTok poses at least two threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the user data collected poses cybersecurity risks. China could use the app to seize the data or access the software of millions of users, including gaining access to the camera and microphone on users’ mobile devices. Second, TikTok provides Beijing an opportunity to control information and promote propaganda to overseas audiences, with a keen understanding of how users respond to content and transparency. Documents revealed by the Guardian in 2019 showed how ByteDance sought to advance Chinese foreign policy with TikTok, in part by requiring TikTok employees to remove content about the Tiananmen Square massacre and Falun Gong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searches about the Hong Kong protests have returned few results. In 2019, searches for specific politically sensitive terms, such as the hashtag “#antielab,” indicated suppression of discussions on TikTok. The hashtag “#antielab” had more than 34,000 posts on Instagram but only about 11 posts on TikTok. The hashtags “#HongKongProtests” and “#HongKongProtestors,” which served to rally support for the protests on Twitter, turned up either a single video or an error message on TikTok. Searching with Chinese characters returned similar results. Such results have led to concerns that TikTok can filter out news unfriendly to China and shape Americans’ views of the truth. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director Christopher Wray remarked that he was “extremely concerned” about TikTok and about China using the app to both steal user data and shape public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TikTok’s response to these criticisms is two-fold. First, TikTok claims that many of these policies have been rescinded since 2019. Second, TikTok reports that it is moving U.S. user data onshore with the help of Oracle’s cloud and that it has not and will not provide that data to China. TikTok announced Project Texas in 2021, which would wall off “protected” data for U.S. users, including phone numbers and birthdays. In June 2022, TikTok claimed it was migrating all U.S. user traffic to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, with data centers in the United States and Singapore as backups. These moves were conducted with an eye toward successfully making it through examination by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media is not the only medium where China has made a push to increase its influence through the creation of new information streams. China also uses its global television presence to broadcast a positive image of China into areas that could not otherwise afford digital television and inject a pro-Beijing viewpoint into media in the developed world. The top two global Chinese TV outlets are China Global Television Network (CGTN) and state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV). These state media outlets reach hundreds of millions of television viewers, radio listeners, and social media users abroad, and Freedom House reports that in many cases the outlets provide little to no transparency on who publishes the content. CGTN broadcasts in five languages and has hundreds of journalists stationed overseas. As one assessment concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;SinoVision, a Chinese-language TV broadcaster, and Qiaobao, one of the largest Chinese-language newspapers in the U.S., are subsidiaries of the Asian Culture and Media Group, an arm of the Chinese government. Staff at both places cut their teeth at the state-owned China News Service and are often dispatched to the U.S. for propaganda purposes. Once there, most of their stories on China, Sino-American relations, Taiwan, Hong Kong and related subjects are reproduced from state-owned media such as Xinhua and the People’s Daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can trace narratives through these news outlets, as vetted talking points get repeated. Chinese television outlets have a presence around the world, as solo entities and in joint partnerships. In Africa, Zimbabwe’s state-run television and CCTV signed an agreement in 2011 to share news programing. In Kenya, a popular television service includes Chinese state television in its most affordable package but omits other international news outlets. In a small town in southern Kenya, a new recipient of cheap Chinese digital TV service said, “I didn’t know about China before. . . . I can say it’s good. They have changed this country in a big way, very fast.” Guo Ziqi, the vice chairman of Chinese media company StarTimes, remarked that “Our aim is to enable every African household to afford digital TV, watch good digital TV and enjoy the digital life.” But StarTimes is also heavily subsidized by the Chinese government and has a mandate to portray a rosy picture of China to Africans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Asia, the Thai News Network signed a deal with Xinhua in 2014 to broadcast the &lt;em&gt;China Report&lt;/em&gt; program daily. The Pakistan Television Corporation partnered with ZTE in 2017 to expand digital TV service to rural areas. ZTE issued a statement saying that the agreement “will cover collaboration across R&amp;amp;D of digital terrestrial television technologies, staff training, and content.” Pakistan adopted the Chinese standard for digital television broadcasts in an event officiated by Xi Jinping and Pakistan’s former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. In Laos, Chinese aid facilitated the transition to digital transmission, with the state broadcaster subsequently signing an agreement with a Chinese media company to create joint content, including news programs. In Cambodia, a joint venture has been transmitting Chinese news on local Cambodian stations since 2017. Timor-Leste also agreed with two Chinese companies to embark on a digital television expansion program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CGTN broadcasts in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, and Russian around the globe via satellite, cable, and over the internet. Other global examples of China’s reach include TV Peru’s Channel 7, which broadcast documentaries produced by CGTN about China as Lima hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in 2016. In Cuba, Huawei led the transition from analog to digital television. Portuguese TV launched a prime-time “China Hour” featuring content from Chinese state media, and a German public station aired a current affairs program called &lt;em&gt;Dialogue with China&lt;/em&gt;, coproduced with a controversial CGTN host. In Africa and the Middle East, Chinese state media has also developed unique publications geared toward local populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s control over social media platforms and television networks overseas gives the CCP the opportunity to influence billions of individuals with Chinese propaganda. By exporting information streams that it has the power to control, the CCP can spread a positive image of China and limit or otherwise manipulate negative narratives about China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;existing-media-platforms&quot;&gt;EXISTING MEDIA PLATFORMS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s second strategy to spread information and disinformation overseas is to use existing media platforms to host content that advances its political objectives. China’s print strategy has frequently pursued this approach, which China refers to as “borrowing the boat to reach the sea” (借船出海). The idea is to use existing outlets as a conveyance for Chinese propaganda. As Xi Jinping stated in 2016, “Wherever the readers are, wherever the viewers are, that is where propaganda reports must extend their tentacles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, China Watch has appeared in the folds of the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. The paid advertising supplement, published by &lt;em&gt;China Daily&lt;/em&gt;, has featured stories that depict the CCP’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic in a positive light, claim that the Hong Kong protestors are sponsored by the United States, and protest U.S. trade policy. The inserts generally come with a warning, with the one in the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; clearly stating, “Content in this advertising section was prepared by China Daily, and did not involve the news or opinion staff of The Washington Post.” But criticism of giving the CCP a prominent outlet through which to broadcast its message has led many outlets to drop the insert, passing on millions in ad revenue. Similar inserts have appeared in major newspapers in Spain, the United Kingdom, Australia, Argentina, Peru, Senegal, and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese outlets also provide free content to partners, in particular Chinese-language papers serving Chinese diaspora communities. The Financial Times reported that there was a sharp uptick in content-sharing agreements in 2016 and 2017, with 200 Chinese-language publications around the world broadcasting content created by party-affiliated outlets. However, content sharing is not exclusively limited to Chinese-language outlets. Chinese state news agencies provide content and photos free of charge to appear under the masthead of overseas publications. Freedom House reports that Xinhua has exchange agreements with local counterparts in Australia, Bangladesh, Belarus, Egypt, India, Italy, Laos, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam. Such content often appears native to the independent publication. At best, the fine print identifies the source. These types of content agreements also extend beyond print publications into television and radio programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, China’s approach of “borrowing the boat to reach the sea” is designed to exploit the popularity of existing platforms and co-opt the trust of consumers. Across all mediums, the content is designed to promote a positive image of China while obfuscating the country’s involvement. By appearing in native outlets or as native content, Chinese propaganda is likely to deceive many consumers, who may fail to realize the information they are consuming is possibly biased or misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-censorship-overseas&quot;&gt;CHINESE CENSORSHIP OVERSEAS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing seeks to tightly control the image of China seen by its domestic audience and also seen by those abroad. To do so, the CCP wields a tight grip over the Chinese market to influence information environments globally. This section uses two case studies, the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Hollywood, to examine how the CCP leverages access to China’s massive consumer base to influence foreign media to promote CCP narratives and self-censor to align with Chinese propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2019, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a tweet that said: “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China was outraged. In the following days, nearly 170,000 tweets flooded out of China back at Morey, an effort the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; said “appears to be a coordinated harassment campaign.” Pro-Chinese government accounts mentioned Morey more than 16,000 times. Those accounts most likely were humans at keyboards — “a troll mob,” according to Ben Nimmo, the head of investigations at Graphika Inc. Approximately 4,700 of those replies included “NMSL,” a Chinese acronym meaning “your mother is dead.” This high volume of activity is all the more anomalous given that Twitter is banned in China. Morey quickly deleted his tweet and posted an apology, but the situation continued to escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, the Rockets were the second-most popular team in China, but Chinese state priorities trumped fan support. Chinese state institutions cut ties with the Rockets, as did China’s leading sportswear brand and the club’s main sponsor in China, a bank. The Rockets’ owner, who bought the team in part because of its market share in China, immediately distanced himself from Morey’s tweet. Then Chinese state media and Tencent, both of which held exclusive rights to broadcast NBA games in China, stopped airing NBA games. Tencent resumed airing NBA games 11 days after the tweet — with the exception of games featuring the Rockets. When Morey moved to manage the Philadelphia 76ers in October 2020, that team was removed from Tencent’s broadcasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SOURCE: SCREENSHOT OF&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20191008092754/https://twitter.com/dmorey/status/1181000809363857409&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SINCE DELETED TWEET BY DARYL MOREY, TWITTER POST, OCTOBER 6, 2019, 5:18 P.M.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morey was not the only one to apologize. Numerous NBA officials and players scrambled to either distance themselves from Morey or describe the NBA as apolitical. Rockets star James Harden apologized and said, “We love China.” The NBA issued a statement in English that said: “We recognize that the views expressed by the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. While Daryl has made it clear that this tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals’ educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them.” However, a version translated to Mandarin and published on Weibo said that the league was “extremely disappointed” by the “inappropriate” tweet, which “severely hurt the feelings of Chinese fans.” The NBA spokesman said the English version was the “official” statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some U.S. political leaders on both sides of the aisle accused the NBA of bowing to China’s economic power and excusing Beijing’s human rights violations. The relationship thawed temporarily in October 2020 when Chinese media broadcast the NBA Finals. The broadcast was accompanied by an announcement that the NBA had expressed goodwill and had “made active efforts to support the Chinese people in their fight against COVID-19.” CCTV then renewed the blackout until March 2022, after the Beijing Olympics, when games unceremoniously began reappearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the three-year gap in coverage, NBA team owners and players largely stayed silent while the league worked behind the scenes to repair the relationship. An ESPN in-depth investigation found that while the NBA’s presence in China was worth an estimated $5 billion that was shared equally among the teams — including $1.5 billion for Tencent streaming — many team owners also had “significant personal stakes” in China through their business interests. As the investigation concluded: “ESPN examined the investments of 40 principal owners and found that they collectively have more than $10 billion tied up in China — including one owner whose company has a joint venture with an entity that has been sanctioned by the U.S. government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same owner, Micky Arison of the Miami Heat, was a prominent advocate for human rights in the United States. In 2020, Arison described the Miami Heat’s commitment to social justice as “never-ending,” in the context of racial justice. ESPN cited Robert Kuhn, an adviser to multinational corporations operating in China and to Chinese political leaders, explaining this conundrum: “It’s a tension between those two poles . . . to see companies promoting social justice in the U.S. but staying silent on what would be perceived to be far worse issues in China. This is going to be an issue for the rest of our working lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after the Daryl Morey incident, Enes Kanter Freedom, who played for the Boston Celtics, publicly criticized human rights abuses in China. Kanter Freedom called on his teammates and others in the NBA to speak out against Chinese human rights abuses, and he decorated his game sneakers with phrases about Uyghurs, forced labor, and related issues. Tencent dropped Celtics games in response. The NBA responded that Freedom was allowed to wear shoes advocating his causes and supported his right to speak out. However, Freedom told CNN in 2021 that he was heavily criticized for speaking out against China. “I’ve been talking about all the human rights violations and injustices happening in Turkey for 10 years, and I did not get one phone call,” he said. “I talk about China one day, and I was getting a phone call once every two hours.” Freedom was traded in February 2022 to the Houston Rockets, who waived his contract less than a week later. A Chinese journalist from China Daily, an English-language newspaper owned by the CCP, trolled Freedom. “Now you don’t play basketball,” the journalist said. “John Bolton can play you more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HOLLYWOOD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, China’s soft power has been most significant in its relationship with Hollywood. The size of the Chinese movie market can substantially influence the profitability of a film, Chinese censors let a limited number of films into its market each year, and those censors have a long and inconsistently implemented set of criteria for what makes a good movie. As a result, Hollywood producers will self-censor by removing any elements that could be perceived as critical of China. Producers sometimes also add elements that appeal to Chinese audiences and bureaucrats. As a report by PEN America, a nonprofit organization that supports artistic freedom and human rights, summarized, “The result is a system in which Beijing bureaucrats can demand changes to Hollywood movies — or expect Hollywood insiders to anticipate and make these changes, unprompted — without any significant hue or cry over such censorship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese influence on Hollywood has escalated in the last decade, but the trendline began in the mid-1990s after Mao’s death. Beijing agreed to allow 10 imported movies a year, starting with The Fugitive. But it was Titanic’s box office numbers in China — with $44 million in revenue — that made Hollywood take notice of the potential scale of the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two movies about Tibet in 1997 demonstrated that Beijing had both the will and the muscle to influence the movie market. &lt;em&gt;Kundun&lt;/em&gt;, produced by Disney, and &lt;em&gt;Seven Years in Tibet&lt;/em&gt;, produced by Sony, both featured the Dalai Lama and his Tibetan homeland. Neither film ever appeared on Chinese screens, and Beijing banned both companies entirely from China. While discussing his 2022 book &lt;em&gt;Red Carpet: Hollywood, China and the Global Battle for Cultural Supremacy&lt;/em&gt; with NPR, Erich Schwartzel described the following scene:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The executives at Disney . . . knew if they canceled the production [of &lt;em&gt;Kundun&lt;/em&gt;] as the Chinese authorities had requested, they would have been tarred in the Hollywood community for squelching free expression, for muzzling Martin Scorsese. They knew that they would have a lot of domestic blowback if they did that, too. So they had to really thread the needle. And what they ultimately decided to do was release Kundun into theaters, but bury it. And so Kundun was released on Christmas Day on four screens, and then when it didn’t perform well, the Disney executives used that lousy performance to justify not expanding it much further. And actually, despite all their efforts, they still were banned in China, and the then CEO Michael Eisner had to fly over to Beijing a year later and meet with officials and apologize. There’s a fascinating transcript that exists of his meeting with a Chinese official in which he says, “The bad news is that the movie was released. The good news is that nobody saw it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hollywood’s incentive to play to China’s interests grew considerably in 2012 after then vice president Biden and his counterpart, then vice president Xi Jinping, negotiated a higher quota of 34 movies per year, along with a hike in the percentage of ticket sales that go to back to the studios. By 2018, China surpassed the United States in quarterly box office revenue. In 2020, China officially surpassed the United States as the world’s biggest box office. China had more than 80,000 screens, compared to approximately 39,000 in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any film that hopes to capture some of this vast revenue must first get past Chinese censors in the Central Propaganda Department, the Ministry of State Security, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Public Security, the State Bureau of Religious Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice, the MFA, and numerous other bureaucratic entities. In 2016, Beijing passed the Film Industry Promotion Law, including the following list of reasons content could be banned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Violations of the basic principles of the constitution, incitement of resistance to or undermining of implementation of the constitution, laws, or administrative regulations;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Endangerment of the national unity, sovereignty or territorial integrity; leaking state secrets; endangering national security; harming national dignity, honor or interests; advocating terrorism or extremism;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Belittling exceptional ethnic cultural traditions, incitement of ethnic hatred or ethnic discrimination, violations of ethnic customs, distortion of ethnic history or ethnic historical figures, injuring ethnic sentiments or undermining ethnic unity;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inciting the undermining of national religious policy, advocating cults or superstitions;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Endangerment of social morality, disturbing social order, undermining social stability; promoting pornography, gambling, drug use, violence, or terror; instigation of crimes or imparting criminal methods;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Violations of the lawful rights and interests of minors or harming the physical and psychological health of minors;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Insults or defamation of others, or spreading others’ private information and infringement of others’ lawful rights and interests;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other content prohibited by laws or administrative regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article 36 of the same law goes further, saying that the Chinese state supports films that “transmit the glorious Chinese culture or promote core socialist values.” To reach these vague and arbitrary standards, studios have cast mainland Chinese actors, shot parts of films in China, and even invited Chinese regulators to visit their sets. In the 2014 film &lt;em&gt;Transformers: Age of Extinction&lt;/em&gt;, Mark Wahlberg’s character withdraws money from a China Construction Bank ATM while in Texas. In another scene from the same film, a character buys Chinese protein powder at a Chicago convenience store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One studio was shocked by the vague objection that got its film, &lt;em&gt;In Good Company&lt;/em&gt;, banned. In the film, a young businessman gets a job and displaces his older boss. Chinese censors said that they would not allow a movie centered on a younger generation challenging the system. The Marvel Studios film &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; was designed with China in mind, but China banned the film — almost certainly for political reasons. Simu Liu, the lead actor in the movie, left China in the mid-1990s and criticized his former country as a third world country whose people “were dying of starvation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such themes getting films banned, film studios do not dare take on third rail topics, such as the Uyghur oppression, Taiwanese independence, or Hong Kong. As one Hollywood producer acknowledged: “All of us are fearful of being named in an article even generally discussing China in Hollywood.” Another Hollywood producer put it bluntly: “It’s hard for people to speak on the record if they want to keep their jobs.” In an additional example of Chinese influence, Chloe Zhao was lauded by Beijing as an acclaimed director until an old interview surfaced where she said that in China “there are lies everywhere.” Beijing responded by deleting social media celebrations of her Oscar win, canceling the release of her celebrated film &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt;, and banning the movie &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;, which she directed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also begun to produce higher-quality films, squeezing the space available for Hollywood blockbusters. In 2020, the top 25 highest-grossing movies of all time in the box office in China included only seven Hollywood films. The rest were produced in China or Hong Kong. One example of a made-in-China blockbuster was &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior 2&lt;/em&gt;. As one U.S. academic wrote, the movie “hammers away at a single message: China is bringing security, prosperity, and modern health care to Africa, while the United States is bringing only misery.” The movie made $802 million, making it one of the highest-grossing films in Chinese history. Similarly, the movies &lt;em&gt;Operation Mekong&lt;/em&gt; (2016) and &lt;em&gt;Operation Red Sea&lt;/em&gt; (2018) describe Chinese soldiers as virtuous and brave and are explicitly anti-American. In 2021, China released &lt;em&gt;The Battle at Lake Changjin&lt;/em&gt;, a fictitious account of the 1950 Battle of the Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War. The movie, which centers around a conventional battle between U.S. and Chinese forces, garnered nearly $1 billion at the worldwide box office, making it the highest-grossing Chinese film of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In yet another example of Chinese influence in Hollywood, the U.S. actor John Cena, one of the stars of F9 (from the “Fast and Furious” series), referred to Taiwan as a country — and then went to great lengths to apologize. The producers had worked hard to position the movie for success in China. It was coproduced with the state-owned China Film Group Corp., and it premiered in China more than a month before it appeared in the United States, at a time suitable for the Chinese centenary celebrations. But Cena, who was taking Mandarin lessons, told a Taiwanese broadcaster in Mandarin that “Taiwan is the first country that can watch F9.” Cena then issued a rambling apology in Mandarin on Weibo: “I made a mistake, I must say right now. It’s so, so, so, so, so, so important. I love and respect Chinese people . . . I’m very sorry for my mistakes. Sorry. Sorry. I’m really sorry. You have to understand that I love and respect China and Chinese people.” F9 then grossed $136 million in its first weekend in China, more than double its North American box office take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executives in the NBA, Hollywood, and other businesses understand that China is watching them, including what their executives say in public. For anyone hoping to tap into China’s enormous consumer market, the deal is clear: align with the approved narratives of the CCP or jeopardize profits. In this way, the fear of losing access to the Chinese market advances the CCP’s propaganda efforts in foreign information environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lawful-political-influence-and-information-activities&quot;&gt;LAWFUL POLITICAL INFLUENCE AND INFORMATION ACTIVITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to targeting the media environments of foreign countries, China attempts to spread propaganda by directly influencing political leaders and institutions. China — like other nation-states — enlists overseas consultants, lobbyists, and public relations experts to conduct a wide range of information activities on its behalf. In many countries, political campaign financing and foreign agent registration laws are designed to prevent interference in domestic policy deliberations and elections. Such regulations include the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) and the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) in the United States, the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme (FITS) and the Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform Act in Australia, and the proposed Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS) in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although governed by certain country-specific prohibitions and reporting requirements, mechanisms such as FARA, LDA, and FITS are primarily designed as disclosure statutes in that they are intended to ensure that government officials and the public are aware of the true source or sponsor of certain sources of information. As such, many of the public relations, lobbying, and other political activities of registered “agents of foreign principals” are not forms of covert influence, as the connection between the domestic “agent” and the “foreign principal” is a matter of public record. Nevertheless, China and other countries recognize that adept navigation of these disclosure requirements provides an important vehicle for shaping policy, opinions, and broader discourse about issues of strategic concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While transparency regulations provide tools for governments and their citizens to identify direct connections between certain activities and their foreign sponsors, these regulations are often not set up to disclose incidents in which foreign agent activities have indirect or second-order impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the types of activities that Chinese actors undertake under transparency statutes, the CSIS research team focused on documents that are made available to the public under the United States’ FARA and LDA statutes as well as documentation made available to the public pursuant to Australia’s FITS program. Overall, these transparency statutes reveal the range of activities that are conducted by registered agents in the United States and Australia, which includes work for four general categories of foreign principals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese government establishments, including embassies and local consulates (which are required to be disclosed under FARA);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Organizations widely attributed to the CCP’s united front efforts, including the China-United States Exchange Foundation and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (which are typically disclosed under FARA);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category 3:&lt;/strong&gt; State-owned or state-affiliated enterprises, such as Huawei, Hikvision, DJI, and Bytedance (which could be disclosed under FARA or the LDA, depending on the type of activity); and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category 4:&lt;/strong&gt; State-owned media franchises, such as &lt;em&gt;China Daily&lt;/em&gt; and CGTN (which are typically disclosed under FARA).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, for example, 15 Chinese “foreign principals” were actively registered under FARA, with a total of 22 U.S.-based “foreign agents” representing these entities. Since 2017, a total of 38 Chinese foreign principals have registered under FARA, several of them repeatedly as they commissioned new work on China’s behalf. Since 2010, a total of 75 FARA registrations have been associated with China, ranking Beijing seventh among all foreign powers, ahead of the eighth-place United Arab Emirates (64 registrations) and behind South Korea and Turkey (tied at 78 registrations). U.S. entities engaged in certain lobbying activities are exempt from FARA if they opt to register under the LDA, as long as they are not lobbying on behalf of a foreign government or a foreign political party. Much of the lobbying activity that is conducted on behalf of a Chinese state-owned and state-affiliated enterprise is disclosed through the U.S. Congress’s LDA reporting system rather than through FARA. Since 2005, a total of 116 Chinese-owned entities have registered lobbying activities under the LDA, which includes the U.S.-based lobbying activities of many high-profile Chinese technology companies, such as Hikvision, Lexmark, Lenovo, DJI, Bytedance, and Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this section focuses on the activities undertaken on behalf of entities registered under FARA that fall under the first two categories referenced above. It is within the activities of these two types of foreign principals where an “influence the influencer” approach to Chinese propaganda is most pronounced, as will be described in specific examples below. Moreover, these activities are often different from those conducted on behalf of the entities included in the third and fourth categories. The connections between the foreign principal and the foreign agent are often much clearer, as the activities of the foreign agent are often conducted clearly under the banner of the foreign principal. Examples include the rebroadcast and distribution of Chinese state media as well as instances in which U.S. public relations firms may assist with brand awareness and marketing, such as in the case of a U.S. firm that managed Huawei’s U.S.-based social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following example highlights how the Chinese government and organizations associated with the CCP’s broader united front work navigate FARA requirements to conduct information operations and perception management activities that can be difficult to measure and complicated to attribute to China. In December 2021, a U.S.-based public relations firm registered as a foreign agent after signing a $300,000 contract with the Consulate General of the People’s Republic of China in New York to develop a social media campaign to promote the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. As stipulated in the contract, the Chinese government had the authority to approve all content generated in support of the campaign and directed the specific themes that the campaign should emphasize, including “Beijing’s history, cultural relics, modern life of people, new trends, etc.” and “any good things in China-US relations.” The U.S.-based public relations firm subsequently worked through an intermediary firm to hire 11 social media influencers to conduct the consulate’s social media campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As disclosed at the conclusion of the contract, a total of 26 social media posts were paid for by the Chinese government that reached 4 million interactions across Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. None of these social media posts needed to disclose the actual sponsor of the content, which was the Chinese government. Exacerbating the challenge surrounding this type of influence, the media firm working as China’s foreign agent operated according to its obligations under FARA. It disclosed its activities to U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), including the various individuals contacted pursuant to the work on behalf of the Chinese consulate. Nevertheless, the social media influencers hired as part of these efforts were not subject to the same disclosure requirements. Their social media posts needed no disclaimer that their posts had ultimately been paid for by China. The millions of social media users who encountered the 26 sponsored posts could not have known that the posts were connected to — and paid for by — the Chinese government until the details of the campaign were filed with the DOJ in April 2022. This date came two months after the Olympics concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-3&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explored several ways that China is extending the reach of its information and disinformation into foreign media and political environments, but it is by no means an exhaustive analysis. Though the tool kit for spreading information and disinformation is constantly evolving, China’s goal remains the same: to increase Chinese power and influence and decrease U.S. power and influence. The CCP advances its goals through propaganda by promoting a positive view of China and suppressing and delegitimizing criticism. Without access to unbiased information, international audiences may fail to recognize and hold Beijing accountable for its part in controversial issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the effects of information and disinformation alone are difficult to measure, one can look for indicators of China’s success. The CCP has successfully established dominance over Chinese-language media in the diaspora; created self-censorship in some Western industries, including Hollywood; and influenced content on some of the largest international social media platforms. However, there are limits to Beijing’s propaganda efforts. China has also orchestrated an aggressive intimidation and pressure campaign against multinational companies — including conducting police raids of U.S. companies Bain &amp;amp; Company and the Mintz Group — in China. As U.S. Congressman Mike Gallagher remarked in April 2023, “The CCP’s updated counter-espionage law sends a loud, clear signal to the world: there is no such thing as a private company in China. . . . Our business leaders need to take off their golden blindfolds and recognize that the recent police raids of American companies Bain and Mintz are not one-offs but part of a long, proud tradition of exploitation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media outlets and digital platforms still publish content that is critical of China. In addition, views of China in the United States have become increasingly negative over the past several years, according to public opinion polls. Unfavorable views of China are also high in numerous Indo-Pacific countries (such as South Korea, Japan, Australia, and India) and European countries (such as Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Germany). Nevertheless, China’s propaganda efforts should not be underestimated as the country continues to grow its sprawling tool kit to control information internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-united-front&quot;&gt;THE UNITED FRONT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone must remember: no matter where you are, you are sons and daughters of China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-xi-jinping-3&quot;&gt;– Xi Jinping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This chapter focuses on Chinese Communist Party (CCP) efforts to disrupt perceived security and reputational harm through “united front” work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Used in this context, united front work involves activity to protect and bolster the image of China and the CCP by monitoring and countering criticism overseas. United front work includes widespread intimidation and harassment of Chinese students, diaspora communities, and critics of Chinese domestic and foreign policy on a global scale. It also includes activities conducted in support of China’s soft-power agenda, which seeks to influence individuals who are potentially well positioned to amplify China’s preferred messaging on political, economic, and academic issues. As Stanford University professor Larry Diamond summarized, “China is deploying classic Communist Party ‘united front’ tactics to penetrate and coopt the soft tissues of democracy — universities, think tanks, research centers, new media, the arts, corporations, community organizations, political parties, and local governments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;United front work has evolved under Xi Jinping as one of the cornerstones of the CCP’s efforts to conduct a wide range of political influence and information operations globally. The CCP’s main organization for conducting united front work is the United Front Work Department (UFWD). However, there are also dozens of organizations with both direct and indirect links to the UFWD which are responsible for promoting CCP discipline on a global scale, focusing primarily on Chinese students and diaspora communities, and building bonds with influential global political, business, and academic leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter illustrates how united front work materializes across core elements of China’s political warfare strategy. It focuses on how the united front intersects with global institutions of higher learning, how the united front and its affiliates engage in overseas political influence and interference, and how the united front is deployed to extend the reach of the CCP and China into worldwide Chinese diaspora communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this chapter argues, one of the most significant impacts of China’s overseas united front work is undermining the sovereignty of the countries where these activities take place. In democracies, united front activities often undermine the freedoms that Chinese students and diaspora communities are entitled to while residing in countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and many European states. China, often operating under the guise of various united front affiliated organizations, uses multiple tools to harass, intimidate, and punish perceived enemies overseas and their families in China. In other cases, united front activities undermine sovereignty by manifesting in varying levels of covert influence. Beijing — often operating through various united front-affiliated organizations — is adept at complying with foreign influence transparency regimes in ways that often limit the public’s ability to fully understand the scope of Beijing’s activities. This chapter identifies several specific examples where existing U.S. laws governing foreign media, lobbying, and academic activities may not be capable of shedding sufficient light on Beijing’s engagement in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this chapter provides an overview of the history of the united front and its resurgence under the leadership of Xi Jinping. It then analyzes available open-source evidence of overseas united front work in the areas of higher education, politics, and diaspora communities. Next, it closes with a broader analysis of the impact of these activities. As will be evident in all three of the case studies, broader united front work integrates efforts to make friends and punish enemies, with the primary focus — as described by Xi Jinping in early 2023 — to build on the theme of “following the party unswervingly and forging ahead in the new era hand in hand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-fronts-historic-importance-to-the-ccp&quot;&gt;THE UNITED FRONT’S HISTORIC IMPORTANCE TO THE CCP&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The united front is deeply rooted in the idea of the modern People’s Republic of China (PRC) as a unitary party state, with the CCP overseeing all aspects of social, political, and economic life. The concept of the “united front” (统战), which is rooted in Leninism, has served a central role in the CCP since Mao Zedong described it as one of the party’s “three magic weapons” (三个法宝) — alongside armed struggle and party building — in 1939. Mao was writing of the CCP’s temporary alliances with Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang nationalists in the 1920s and, as he wrote in 1939, during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The concept, as he envisioned it, emphasized unifying diverse elements under the central control and direction of the CCP. In the early years of the PRC, this included the establishment of dozens of party-affiliated organizations designed to exert control over the vast majority of Chinese citizens who were not members of the CCP. Although Chinese leaders since Mao have rhetorically highlighted the importance of the united front as a concept, the party’s commitment to such work languished for decades. It was not until the ascendance of Xi Jinping that united front work reemerged as a CCP priority, particularly as a key pillar of China’s efforts to expand its global influence. As this chapter describes, the united front has reemerged under Xi as a key component of Chinese political warfare, with different elements operating under the broader banner of “united front work” overseas to shape perceptions, influence powerful friends, and intimidate and punish the CCP’s enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since taking power, Xi Jinping has reenergized and reformed united front work and made it a critical element of China’s domestic and foreign policies. This focus on united front work as part of his leadership should come as little surprise in light of his own prior writings on the subject. In 1995, while still a CCP official in Fujian province, Xi urged that united front efforts should be expanded and prioritized: “We believe that the work of overseas Chinese affairs in the new era should break through geographical boundaries, jump out of the scope of overseas Chinese affairs departments, and make it a major event of the party and governments at all levels, and a major event of common concern and participation of the whole society.” Once in power, Xi echoed Mao’s vision of united front work, including in a September 2014 speech to the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a key united front organ: “The united front is an important magic weapon for the Communist Party of China to win the cause of revolution, construction, and reform, and also to realize the greatness of the Chinese nation. An important magic weapon for revival.” These remarks were quickly followed by a reorganization of the party’s approach to united front work, which included the April 2015 release of new “Regulations on the Work of the United Front of the Communist Party of China,” hailed by the CCP as “the first intra-party regulation of our party on the work of the united front.” Ushering in this new era for the united front, in May 2015, Xi presided over the first United Front Work Conference in nine years. Notably, this convening represented the first time in the party’s history that the conference was held at the central, rather than national, level, a significant elevation in status within CCP governance. At this first ever “Central United Front Work Conference,” Xi made the overarching intent abundantly clear: “The policies implemented and the measures taken must be conducive to maintaining and consolidating the party’s leadership and ruling position.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the enduring importance and continued evolution of united front work under Xi’s leadership, the united front regulations were revised again in late 2020. Additionally, in a series of reorganizations that occurred in 2018 and 2019, Xi transferred several critical overseas responsibilities from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and merged the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office into the CCP’s primary united front organ — the UFWD. These moves consolidated many of the responsibilities for monitoring, influencing, and coopting diaspora communities into the UFWD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope of the CCP’s united front work, both domestically and abroad, is massive, and a full accounting of the various entities through which the party and the Chinese government advance efforts through united front work would not be practical to include in this chapter. Moreover, the full scope of what formally distinguishes united front work from other efforts to promote the interests of the CCP is often blurry. As such, it is difficult to fully disaggregate China’s approach to united front work from its broader global intelligence and information warfare activities. As reflected in the chapter on Chinese espionage operations (Chapter 3), there is significant overlap between China’s efforts to monitor, co-opt, and intimidate overseas dissident groups and the priorities of united front work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many circumstances, various patterns of China’s overseas activities cannot be attributed to a specific entity. For example, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), Ministry of Public Security (MPS), People’s Liberation Army (PLA), Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and various united front organizations engage in similar patterns of behavior, particularly when antagonizing overseas diaspora groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several scholars have described the UFWD as a form of intelligence service. There are justified reasons for viewing the UFWD and the broader campaign of united front work through this lens. Zhou Enlai — an architect of China’s intelligence and security apparatus — advocated for “nestling intelligence within the United Front” and “using the United Front to push forth intelligence.” As Zhou also reportedly pointed out, “intelligence work should be done by making friends and talking to each other, building bases, establishing relationships, and going deep into society.” These are all core elements of united front work in the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-front-in-academia&quot;&gt;THE UNITED FRONT IN ACADEMIA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, concerns about China’s influence within global higher education have steadily increased. This has included scrutiny of the Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes on campuses worldwide. The Chinese government established the Confucius Institute program in 2004. Hanban, a Chinese government agency chaired by a member of the Politburo and the vice premier of China, oversees the program. Its goals are to promote Chinese language and culture, support local Chinese teaching overseas, and facilitate cultural exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Confucius Institutes have stifled open and free debate. Hanban hired and trained teachers to oversee academic courses within U.S. universities, and research proposals had to be approved by Hanban. Numerous examples of censorship began to emerge by Confucius Institutes across the globe — such as in Sweden, Portugal, Australia, and Canada — stifling discussion in classrooms and at conferences. Hanban instructed teachers in Confucius Institutes to prevent the discussion of issues that were politically taboo in China, such as the status of Taiwan, the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre orchestrated by PLA forces, human rights, China’s pro-democracy movement, and the status of China’s beleaguered Uyghur population. Marshall Sahlins, an anthropology professor at the University of Chicago, argued that “by hosting a Confucius Institute, they [universities] have become engaged in the political and propaganda efforts of a foreign government in a way that contradicts the values of free inquiry and human welfare to which they are otherwise committed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials also expressed alarm that the MSS was using Confucius Institutes to recruit spies and collect intelligence on Chinese individuals in the United States. “The Chinese have multiple goals with Confucius Institutes, including to monitor Chinese communities in the United States and other Western countries,” said the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)’s Mark Kelton. “The Chinese have also been interested in influencing the tone of debate on campuses and traditional espionage — including spotting and recruiting individuals.” James Olson, chief of counterintelligence at the CIA, explained that China’s MSS “has an elaborate spotting program to identify those students who show political or cultural sympathy for China.” By 2009, there were 90 Confucius Institutes housed at U.S. universities — including prestigious institutions such as Columbia, Stanford, and Chicago — and a total of 440 across the globe. But widespread national security and other concerns about Confucius Institutes led to a substantial reduction in the number of these entities operating on campuses in the United States and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other united front activities targeting higher education include pro-China campaigns, particularly through various Chinese cultural and academic exchange initiatives. These united front activities integrate tools to intimidate and punish enemies, as Beijing deploys an increasingly strident and aggressive approach to shaping and controlling narratives around issues the CCP views as sensitive. These activities manifest in a wide range of global incidents — including in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States — in which Chinese government entities and proxies have engaged in acts of intimidation, harassment, and censorship targeting both Chinese nationals and students and faculty who are critical of Chinese policy on topics such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjian, the South China Sea, and Tibet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key factor in the threat to higher education is the financial dependency that some universities have on various forms of Chinese funding. According to a U.S. Department of Education (DOE) database documenting foreign donations, China is the fifth-largest foreign source of financial contributions to U.S. universities, accounting for more than $2.8 billion in grants and contracts since 1987. As acknowledged by the DOE in 2021, however, these numbers are “systematically underinclusive and inaccurate,” as existing obligations only require donations that exceed $250,000 in a calendar year to be reported. The DOE referred to existing reporting as “unaudited, self-reported data” and suggested that “the public have real reason for concern that foreign money buys influence or control over teaching, research, and possibly even U.S. government policy.” A 2019 U.S. Senate investigation corroborated the DOE’s contention, finding that nearly 70 percent of U.S. schools that received more than $250,000 to establish Confucius Institutes did not report the donations to the DOE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign student tuition is also a critical source of revenue for many U.S. colleges and universities, as these students — including Chinese students — often pay full tuition. In some cases, such arrangements have created significant financial dependencies and, as fewer Chinese students have sought U.S. visas following the Covid-19 pandemic, many universities have experienced declines in Chinese student populations and the corresponding revenue. For several U.S. universities, the decline in Chinese students may have decreased revenue by more than $20 million per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This level of financial dependence creates conditions where Chinese united front and information activities may be more impactful. As discussed throughout this report, Beijing is increasingly weaponizing its global market power to control speech on topics that it deems sensitive. China’s ability to inflict financial harm has contributed to several university decisions to comply with Beijing’s efforts to suppress unwelcome narratives and debate. This includes incidents such as the University of Sydney’s 2013 effort to withdraw support for an on-campus speech by the Dalai Lama, despite having hosted a lecture the year before about the Dalai Lama that was sponsored by the campus’s Confucius Institute. After widespread negative attention, the university reversed course and allowed the speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigations in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States have uncovered several methods that the CCP leverages to shape perceptions and control speech on university campuses. Many of these threats reflect the long arm of the Chinese party-state, which works through multiple united front affiliated organizations — including Chinese Student and Scholars Associations (CSSAs), the Western Returned Scholars Association, and party cells on foreign university campuses — in coordination with components such as the MSS, MPS, and Central Commission for Discipline Inspection to monitor and threaten students suspected of speaking out on sensitive topics. Speaking before the Western Returned Scholars Association in 2013, Xi Jinping admonished: “Everyone must remember: no matter where you are, you are sons and daughters of China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As documented in a testimony before an Australian parliamentary committee and similar studies in the United States and United Kingdom, this policy stance has resulted in cases where Chinese students are harassed or intimidated by fellow students or reported to the Chinese consulate or embassy. Chinese law enforcement and security agencies assist by intimidating or threatening the China-based families of overseas students. Students have also been jailed after returning to China because of social media posts they made while studying abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts by the state security services and the CCP to exercise control over overseas Chinese students and discussions on the campuses where they study is augmented by various united front entities, such as the CSSAs that operate on hundreds of university campuses worldwide. While CSSAs provide important services to students studying abroad, they have also been directly tied to efforts to amplify Chinese messaging or suppress freedom of expression. In one 2022 example, the CSSA at George Washington University launched a series of protests after posters created by an Australia-based Chinese dissident artist appeared on campus. The posters, which were designed to raise awareness of Chinese human rights abuses in connection to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, were decried by the CSSA as “a naked attack on the Chinese nation” and purportedly reflected “extremely vicious attacks on all international students from China and Asian groups.” The university’s president responded by ordering the posters removed. He later reversed this position after widespread condemnation because of the posters’ origin as a form of political protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSSAs are often mobilized to denounce critics, stage counterprotests, or greet visiting Chinese dignitaries. A Chinese diplomat who defected to Australia in 2005 claimed that CSSAs “are in fact controlled by the Chinese [diplomatic] mission and are an extension of the Chinese communist regime abroad.” This contention is supported by various incidents, including disclosures on various CSSA websites and the acknowledged collaboration in 2017 between the CSSA at the University of California, San Diego and the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles to protest the Dalai Lama speaking at the university’s commencement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the CCP’s efforts to suppress freedom of expression and speech on global university campuses represent the most acute united front threat to higher education, united front work extends onto university campuses in other ways that are more reflective of China’s soft-power strategy. Globally, there are numerous groups — similar to the Confucius Institutes — that focus on promoting friendship and telling China’s story. One notable example of how these programs work can be observed in the activities of an organization associated with the united front known as the China-U.S. Exchange Foundation (CUSEF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CUSEF was founded in 2008 by Tung Chee-hwa, a Hong Kong-based billionaire, “to encourage constructive dialogue and diverse exchanges between the people of the U.S. and China.” Tung, a former chief executive of Hong Kong, is a vice chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the CCP body that provides overall strategic guidance to the UFWD. CUSEF sponsors several programs in the United States, some of which are disclosed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). These include work conducted on behalf of CUSEF by a U.S. firm that arranges CUSEF-sponsored travel to China for presidents and students from historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as well as to manage a free Mandarin-language course of study for HBCU students. Other CUSEF activities have included funding various initiatives, research, and events at universities and think tanks. Although some involved in these efforts attest that CUSEF put no specific conditions or limitations on funding, other experts such as Peter Mattis suggest the intent is to pursue “ecological change.” As Mattis noted, “If they cultivate enough people in the right places, they start to change the debate without having to directly inject their own voice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-influence-and-interference&quot;&gt;POLITICAL INFLUENCE AND INTERFERENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soft-power approach to united front work of groups such as CUSEF is particularly relevant to CCP efforts to influence domestic political discourse in foreign countries. This includes additional work by CUSEF — working through another FARA-registered foreign agent — to arrange travel for former members of U.S. Congress to China “on educational trips to exchange views on U.S.-China relations.” In addition to facilitating travel, this representative works with CUSEF to engage with other influential Americans, such as current and former members of Congress and their staff and conducting “policy and political intelligence gathering and analysis on China issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Chinese-affiliated entity, the U.S.-China Transpacific Foundation, works through the same U.S.-based representative to arrange travel to China for current congressional staff, paying for such travel pursuant to the Mutual Education and Cultural Exchange Act, which allows U.S. government personnel to accept travel paid for by foreign governments. These exchange visits are often co-sponsored by the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs, which, according to its mission statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . [is] guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy; is committed to “making friends for the country” by taking concerted actions with China’s overall diplomacy, expanding foreign exchanges, telling Chinese stories, promoting interaction between China and the rest of the world, and facilitating the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the development of these exchange programs can be directly correlated to China’s broader united front work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing also pursues broader campaigns of foreign political influence and interference that are closely tied to the united front. In the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and across continental Europe, China conducts a range of political influence activities via several united front-affiliated organizations. In some circumstances, these activities can be interpreted as efforts in long-term seeding and influence. As Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director Christopher Wray argued in 2022: “The Chinese government understands that politicians in smaller roles today may rise to become more influential over time. So they look to cultivate talent early — often state and local officials — to ensure that politicians at all levels of government will be ready to take a call and advocate on behalf of Beijing’s agenda.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s efforts to influence domestic politics emerged as a firestorm after events in 2016 revealed several links between CCP money and Australian politicians. The most prominent case involved billionaire property developer Huang Xiangmo, who moved from China to Australia in 2011. In the weeks leading up to the 2016 federal elections, Xiangmo and Australian senator Sam Dastyari came under scrutiny after Dastyari spoke at a press conference organized by the Australian Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China. The council’s mission is to build relationships and promote messaging in Australia in support of the reunification of China and Taiwan. It is an official branch of the China Council for Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China, which is a prominent component of the united front. In reference to territorial disputes in the South China Sea, Dastyari said at the press conference: “The Chinese integrity of its borders is a matter for China, and the role that Australia should be playing, as a friend, is to know, that with the several thousand years of history, thousands of years of history, where it is and isn’t our place to be involved.” Dastyari’s remarks parroted a common CCP talking point and were in direct contradiction to the position taken by Labor Party shadow minister Stephen Conroy just the day before, who had sharply criticized China’s island building and pledged that a Labor government would support freedom of navigation operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dastyari initially denied making the remarks, but recordings released in 2017 confirmed that he did. Although no laws were broken, the event and Dastyari’s association with Xiangmo sparked political backlash that led to Dastyari apologizing and resigning from his position within the party. A series of ensuing media investigations revealed that Xiangmo had previously paid legal bills for Dastyari and threatened to withhold a $450,000 donation to the Labor Party if it did not soften its stance on China’s activities in the South China Sea. In the end, Dastyari resigned from parliament in December 2017 after it was revealed that he had alerted Xiangmo to the possibility that his phone was being monitored by Australian and U.S. intelligence agencies. Huang Xiangmo’s Australian residency was canceled in 2019 over concerns about his political donations and connections to the united front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the Dastyari affair and other similar controversies, Australia passed a series of campaign finance, counter-interference, and espionage laws. In July 2022, a Chinese man accused of planning foreign interference was committed to stand trial in Victoria’s County Court. Di Sanh Duong was the first person to be charged under Australia’s new foreign interference laws, and his case provides the first test of the scope of the law, which criminalizes the intent to interfere with Australia’s political institutions or support the intelligence activities of a foreign government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar influence campaigns involving the united front have been identified in the United Kingdom. In January 2022, the United Kingdom’s Security Service (MI5) issued a rare interference alert to the UK parliament warning of a Chinese agent seeking to establish links between the CCP and current and aspiring members. Christine Ching Kui Lee was active in UK political circles for more than a decade, and her law firm made several sizeable donations to members of the UK government. Although none of Lee’s activities were explicitly illegal and she had been on MI5’s radar for several years, the formal alert was issued after she deliberately concealed her connection to the UFWD. Following MI5’s warning, Lee reportedly stepped down from leadership positions of her UK businesses. Speaking on the issue during a joint address with FBI director Christopher Wray in July 2022, director general of MI5 Ken McCallum said, “The UK is a free country and people are free to hold whatever opinions they choose. But if their advocacy of CCP positions is a consequence of hidden manipulation, I would prefer for them — and us — to be conscious of that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the preceding U.S., Australian, and UK examples reflect how China successfully navigates the idiosyncrasies of these legal systems to conduct influence activities without breaking laws, the same cannot be said of other incidents — most notably recent reports of Chinese bribery in the Solomon Islands. Recent controversies on the islands involving the country’s current prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, have caused political unrest and drawn concern from the United States and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sogavare has served four terms as prime minister of the Solomon Islands. Two of his previous terms were cut short by no-confidence motions, and his current term began amid no less controversy. In 2019, he ran for parliament and eventually became the prime minister after several days of intense backroom negotiations. Shortly after taking office, Sogavare announced that the Solomon Islands would recognize the Chinese government in Beijing, despite having personally called for the UN General Assembly to recognize Taiwan just two years earlier. This reversal led to accusations that Beijing had influenced Sogavare’s return to office. Several members of parliament claim that they were approached with bribes from Beijing to support the decision to recognize China around the same time. The deputy leader of the opposition, Peter Kenilorea, Jr., claimed he was made an offer of $1 million to “say nice things about China” and that it was “an open secret that money is always involved in these things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2021, Sogavare survived another vote of no confidence. Ahead of the vote, the prime minister’s office legally distributed $2.49 million from a national fund to 39 of the parliament’s 50 members. The money in the fund was provided by the Chinese government, who agreed to continue the practice originally established by Taiwan. Critics argued Sogavare was engaged in vote buying to remain in office and advance China’s political interests. Four months later, Sogavare announced that the Solomon Islands had signed a security agreement with China, sparking fears that Beijing was moving closer to establishing military basing on the islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-4&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this chapter noted, the activities implemented under the banner of the united front mirror broader patterns of activity that align with China’s approach to political warfare. There is a clear pattern of harassment and intimidation that serves a key role in the activities of the united front. The CCP’s overarching mission is to consolidate direction and control over all elements of Chinese society. Since the party’s founding, the mission of exerting control over individuals and groups that are not directly subordinate to the party has been the primary purpose of united front work. China’s increasingly global ambitions, alongside the onset of the digital age, has dramatically expanded the areas that the party-state views as central to sustaining its unquestioned control over domestic and foreign discourse about China. It is in this area where China’s repressive efforts under the banner of the united front are most corrosive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extending the party’s arm beyond China’s borders — to suppress freedom of expression implicitly or explicitly in countries where that freedom is a protected right — is a violation of sovereignty and responsible statecraft. Investigations across academia and civil society suggest that these efforts disproportionately affect diaspora communities, but they also extend beyond direct threats and into forms of self-censorship. In one example, 25 academics in Australia acknowledged that they were hesitant to speak on issues such as Xinjiang and Hong Kong out of fear that they would be recorded, doxxed, or harassed. The stakes for diaspora communities are much higher. This can be observed across multiple lines of effort, including in activities carried out under Operation Fox Hunt (as noted in Chapter 3) and in the intimidation and threats that Chinese citizens and their families in the mainland endure when they are perceived as deviating from the party’s strict control over thought and speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of China’s soft-power efforts under the banner of the united front is also difficult to measure. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that Chinese money and influence can translate into favorable policies, even in Western-style democracies. These soft-power efforts include hundreds, if not thousands, of united front-connected groups that focus on shaping perceptions about China’s views on issues of strategic importance, such as reunification with Taiwan, territorial rights in the South China Sea, democracy, and human rights. Reflecting the integration of multiple tools of national power in support of Beijing’s information warfare strategy, the soft-power elements of united front work augment China’s public diplomacy, economic development, and perception management efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple investigations of political influence and interference in Europe further underscore how various state organs, such as elements of the Ministry of Commerce and MFA, align with non-state actors operating under various united front banners to build networks of influence at the national and subnational levels. This includes synchronizing the domestic political activities of overseas united front organizations (such as the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, the Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China, and the Soong Ching Ling Foundation) with overseas state media and China’s bureaucratic organizations (such as the MFA’s Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and the Ministry of Commerce’s China Council for the Promotion of International Trade). Ultimately, these efforts are designed to promote positive perceptions of China’s strategic efforts, focusing on cultivating influential voices and decisionmakers across all elements of society, often integrating economic benefits and other enticements like the bribes used in the case of the Solomon Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irregular-military-actions&quot;&gt;IRREGULAR MILITARY ACTIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Constructing a maritime superpower” is an important component of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and is the essence of Xi Jinping’s maritime strategy, which has been developed on the basis of thinking on the seas by successive generations of collective leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-jia-yu-and-zhang-xiaoyi&quot;&gt;– Jia Yu and Zhang Xiaoyi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equipped with a spiral of sharp, gnawing metal teeth and measuring 140 meters (459 feet) in length and 2,800 tons in deadweight, the Tian Kun Hao is the largest ship of its kind in Asia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As the ship sets to work, it lowers its steel-tooth-lined cutter head into the sea floor — up to 35 meters below the surface — and tears apart the earth, breaking through anything from soft clay to solid rock at a rate of 6,000 cubic meters per hour. The resulting sand is pumped up and out of the water, then sent to be used in a variety of ways, from components of concrete and mortar for buildings to the foundations of artificial island chains. This operation, however, is far from just a technologically advanced construction project; it is also an example of political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines Chinese irregular military activities, which are an important part of political warfare. As used here, irregular military actions consist of activities short of conventional warfare that are conducted by forces linked directly or indirectly to the state and that are designed to expand a country’s influence and legitimacy. As highlighted later in this chapter, one example is the use of sand dredgers — rather than destroyers or battleships — to build islands in disputed territory and turn them into military bases. Irregular military activities appeal to China because they enable Beijing to expand its geopolitical power and influence — including territorial claims — in a manner that avoids provoking major pushback from other states or escalation into conventional warfare. This chapter considers actors such as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), PLA Navy (PLAN), the PLA Air Force, the PLA Rocket Forces, and the People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM), as well as private security companies and other non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s irregular military capabilities are closely tied to the nation’s growing emphasis on maritime power and reach, which is deeply rooted in its understanding of both Western and Chinese history. China views itself as one of the first nations to leverage the power and resources of the sea. Chinese historical accounts and state rhetoric typically trace this thread to Guan Zhong, a high-ranking philosopher who lived from approximately 720 to 645 BCE. He advised that the Qi state should pursue a “monopoly on mineral and maritime resources” (唯官山海为可耳), which led to comprehensive economic, political, military, and cultural development. Furthermore, the Chinese government completed a study in 2006, titled The Rise of Great Powers, that assessed the reasons for the assent of nine Western nations to “great power” status. The study’s conclusions linked state power to economic development resulting from trade and facilitated by naval power — highlighting the importance of maritime economic connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Xi Jinping argued to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Politburo in 2013, “Historical experience tells us that orienting to the ocean will lead to prosperity, while abandoning the ocean will lead to decline. A strong country is a strong maritime power, and a weak country is a weak maritime power.” He therefore argued in favor of building China into a maritime superpower, which would be strong and outward looking. It would aim to secure China’s local security and sovereignty claims as well as to expand and protect Chinese economic and geopolitical interests abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, China’s maritime strategy rests on the concepts of “near-seas defense” (近海防御) and “far-seas protection” (远海防卫). Although these ideas were publicized in 2015 as the strategy of the PLAN, they also appeared in earlier Chinese strategic documents and were largely inspired by the ideas of Mao Zedong and Alfred Thayer Mahan. Near-seas defense refers to efforts to secure and defend territorial claims, while far-seas protection encompasses “distant ocean mobile operations and non-warfare military activities” that serve to spread and protect Chinese geopolitical and economic influence globally. Chinese strategists have typically defined the far seas as the waters beyond the First Island Chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dichotomy between near and far seas does not imply full, systematic coordination of strategy, either within each realm or across the two. In fact, the concept of a “unified maritime strategy” (海洋战略) is relatively rare within Chinese strategic analyses, and coordination across maritime operations has only begun to improve in recent years. The juxtaposition between near and far seas in this analysis also is not intended to imply that all irregular military activities must be maritime. Still, it is a useful framing device to understand how Beijing conceptualizes its spheres of power, particularly as the country increasingly turns to irregular activities both to enforce its territorial claims near the mainland and to spread influence and power abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many past analyses of Chinese irregular activities focus on Beijing’s activities in and around the South and East China Seas and territorial disputes with neighboring states, this chapter expands the scope of activities assessed to include military-linked channels through which Beijing advances geopolitical goals further abroad. This includes the role of private security companies in advancing China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), research efforts that feed directly into Chinese strategic goals, and China’s newest international project: the Global Security Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of China’s irregular military activities rely on allegedly routine military activities and commercial entities, enabling Beijing to spread power and influence under a guise of deniability. The majority of these activities, including those that rely on civil-military fusion, are not illegal and can pass as routine economic activity, research, or statecraft. Xi Jinping perceives “civil-military fusion” (軍民融合) as a key component of China’s strategic advancement. In his address to the 19th Party Congress, he pledged to “deepen reform of defense-related science, technology, and industry, achieve greater military-civilian integration, and build integrated national strategies and strategic capabilities.” During his address to the 20th Party Congress, Xi similarly vowed to “better coordinate strategies and plans, align policies and systems, and share resources and production factors between the military and civilian sectors.” Furthermore, the emphasis on companies and other economically driven actors as tools of strategic advancement is also connected to China’s perception of economic development and advancements in technology as the key drivers of interstate competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number and diversity of these efforts are highly concerning and may become more threatening as China increasingly focuses on global ambitions, such as its newly formulated Global Security Initiative. While it is possible to comprehensively examine the state of Chinese activities in, for example, the South China Sea, it becomes increasingly difficult to track and counter the totality of Chinese political warfare efforts on a global scale. Still, the absence of centralized, strategic oversight to coordinate these diverse and deniable activities may limit their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter draws on a variety of primary and secondary sources, including Chinese research publications, government white papers and press releases, and speeches by officials; analysis and data reported by U.S. and partner governments and research institutions; satellite imagery; and a new CSIS-created data set of Chinese private security companies operating abroad, including their locations and primary services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this chapter is divided into three main sections. The first section provides an overview of China’s primary near-seas activities, including the use of sand dredgers; coercion through military exercises, harassment campaigns, and forward deployments; the PAFMM; and electronic warfare. The second assesses China’s main far-seas activities, including private security companies, strategy-driven research, and the Global Security Initiative. The final section provides a brief analysis of recent trends in Chinese irregular military activity and their implications for the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;near-seas-activities&quot;&gt;NEAR-SEAS ACTIVITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s near-seas activities primarily focus on maintaining or securing its claims of sovereignty in the South and East China Seas — the world’s most contested waters. Despite Beijing’s phrasing of near-seas defense, the majority of these activities are offensive, justified by the CCP as constituting a response to existential threats. In the same speech in which Xi Jinping declared that China would become a maritime superpower, he explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we must persist in resolving [territorial] disputes through peaceful methods and negotiation methods. . . . On the other hand, we must be prepared to deal with various complex situations, strengthen the building of forces for the protection of maritime rights and law enforcement, accelerate the pace of construction of a modernized navy, improve maritime rights protection capabilities, and resolutely safeguard China’s maritime rights and interests. We love peace and adhere to the path of peaceful development, but we must never give up our legitimate rights and interests, let alone sacrifice our country’s core interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is willing to push the boundaries of “peaceful methods” when disputes threaten what the state believes to be its legitimate and core interests. In order to avoid broader military escalation, however, China typically aims to maintain or secure its territorial claims through irregular means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section outlines four such irregular methods: the use of sand dredgers; military exercises, harassment campaigns, and forward deployments; the PAFMM; and electronic warfare. It examines the nature of these methods and their relationship with the Chinese government, examples of recent activity, and the results and implications of their use to further China’s near-seas goals. These military-linked activities are also frequently accompanied by actions in the legal and information spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SAND DREDGERS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sand dredgers, such as the Tian Kun Hao discussed at the beginning of this chapter, are specialized pieces of equipment that use cutter bars or drills on booms to break up the dirt and rock at the bottom of a body of water and then remove and transport the resulting sand and debris for processing and use in various construction projects. Figure 7.2 depicts the typical components of this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 2017 unveiling of the &lt;em&gt;Tian Kun Hao&lt;/em&gt; — described by its designers as a “magical island-maker” — the crown jewel of Beijing’s dredging fleet was the &lt;em&gt;Tian Jing Hong&lt;/em&gt;, which measures 127 meters (417 feet) long and weighs 2,400 tons. Over the past decade, this self-propelled cutter suction dredger spearheaded many of China’s geographic construction projects in the disputed waters of the South China Sea. In addition to these enormous vessels, Beijing maintains a fleet of smaller dredging vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dredging activities in the water near China and disputed territories have been directly orchestrated by the Chinese government, and Beijing has defended these projects from international criticism across multiple domains. For example, after marine biologists in the United States and other nations criticized China’s island-building project for having devastating effects on local ecosystems, the Chinese government repeatedly defended its efforts as being environmentally friendly. The State Oceanic Administration claimed in 2015 that during these projects, “ecological environmental protection and engineering planning, design, and construction are carried out simultaneously.” Similarly, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) claimed the following year that the construction activities “strictly follow the principle of conducting green project” and are “based on thorough studies and scientific proof.” International scientific consensus indicates the opposite of these statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has pursued two major types of activity using sand dredgers in recent years: artificial island construction and land theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, China has used its dredgers to construct manmade islands in the East and South China Seas, which it then militarized as part of ongoing efforts to assert its claims of sovereignty. Settlements and military installations on these artificial islands permit Beijing to expand the area in which it claims to hold exclusive economic zone (EEZ) jurisdiction. Since 2013, China has created 3,200 acres of land in the Spratly Islands. For example, in early 2015, clusters of Chinese dredgers pulled sand from the seabed and deposited it onto the sparse, undeveloped atoll at Mischief Reef in the eastern Spratly Islands, an area reportedly rich in undeveloped gas and oil resources. Once the land itself was constructed, China set to work establishing military facilities and equipment on the new artificial island, including an airfield and control tower, radar installations, HQ-9B surface-to-air missiles, and YJ-12B anti-ship cruise missiles. Beijing has followed a similar process with other artificial islands in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China has used its sand dredgers to, quite literally, steal land over which it has asserted sovereignty. Driven largely by mainland cities’ efforts to build skyscrapers and large-scale projects such as the construction of the Beijing Daxing International Airport, China has begun to meet its construction industry’s demand for sand by directly harvesting it from Taiwanese coastal territory and outlying islands. To fend off these Chinese incursions and thefts, the Taiwanese coast guard uses radar, watch, and patrol screens, and it has increasingly deployed large patrol ships over the past decade to deter and expel Chinese dredgers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 7.3, there was a dramatic increase in the number of Chinese sand dredgers expelled from Taiwanese waters in 2020, according to data compiled by the Taiwanese coast guard. In 2019, the coast guard reported 605 expulsions — already more than an eightfold increase from 2018. But in 2020, the total number of expulsions skyrocketed to 3,991. The number of incidents has decreased but remains higher than the historical norms, with 665 reported in 2021 and 209 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is no definitive explanation for the sudden increase in Chinese sand dredger expulsions in 2020, this surge correlates with a period of rapid infrastructure development in China driven by Covid-19 recovery policies. The resulting high demand for sand to facilitate construction projects could explain the timing of the peak in 2020. Following the outbreak of Covid-19, Chinese GDP dropped 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2020 — the largest year-on-year decrease it has ever experienced. In April 2020, the Politburo requested efforts “expanding effective investment, strengthening investment in traditional and new infrastructure, expediting upgrades to traditional industry, and expanding investment in emerging strategic industries” in order to mitigate economic harms from the pandemic. The Chinese government defined infrastructure broadly to include information infrastructure, big data and computing capabilities, research and development, and more traditional construction projects, including railways, dams, undersea tunnels, and large-scale water transfer projects. This likely drove a significant increase in demand for sand to support construction efforts. China was likely already facing growing demand for sand due to other infrastructure projects with development timelines within this time period as well, such as the Xiamen Xiangan Airport, which is expected to be completed in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of these incursions have occurred in Penghu and Lienchiang Counties. Of the 3,991 expulsions by the Taiwanese coast guard in 2020, for example, 3,422 (86 percent) occurred in Penghu County and 552 (14 percent) occurred in Lienchiang County, while less than 1 percent of incidents in 2020 occurred elsewhere in Taiwanese waters. The geographic positioning of these islands is significant both because their proximity to mainland China would make them early targets during a potential invasion of Taiwan and because it may provide clues to Beijing’s intent. Lienchiang County — otherwise known as the Matsu Islands — is located northwest of Taiwan’s main island in the East China Sea, a short distance from Fuzhou on the Chinese coast. Penghu County, consisting of the Penghu Islands, is located in the Taiwan Strait approximately 50 km west of the main island. By violating Taiwanese waters in these two counties, China moderates the threat it poses — escalating tensions far less than if it routinely approached the main island — while still gaining efficient access to Taiwanese sand. Beijing is also involved in a secretive build-up on Myanmar’s Great Coco Island, including an expanded airstrip, aircraft hangars, and radar equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oyZMiFf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese island building advances Beijing’s goals to project military power and to defend or reassert sovereign claims, particularly in the South China Sea and surrounding waters. By expanding its presence and capabilities in the region, China aims to coerce other claimants to abandon their rights over maritime areas or islands in favor of Chinese control. Furthermore, by establishing artificial islands with facilities and basing, China has expanded the reach of its claimed EEZs, which now ostensibly can be measured out from the shores of these islands as well. China continues to flout international laws concerning sovereignty and maritime activities as part of a broader “lawfare” campaign to erode trust in the existing international order and norms and to instead shape the international legal environment to better fit its own needs. Lawfare involves the exploitation of international and domestic law to assert the legitimacy of a country’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from accessing sand necessary for construction purposes — China uses 40 percent of global sand aggregates annually and has used more sand in the past four years than the United States has over the past century — the Chinese dredger incursions in Taiwanese waters are likely an effort to harass Taiwan, exhaust its civilian coast guard, and disrupt its economy. In addition to losing sand — one of Taiwan’s most valuable maritime resources — Chinese dredger activities have forced Taiwan to divert and overextend coast guard patrols and monitoring, increase expenses to expand coast guard capabilities, and risk physical aggression when confronting intruding vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese dredging activities also have substantial negative impacts on the local ecosystem and may therefore violate Chinese commitments under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which it ratified. This is not Beijing’s first attempt to selectively apply the UN convention, and it serves as an example of Chinese lawfare. By continuing to violate international law, Beijing seeks to cast doubt on the interpretation or legitimacy of previously decided international legal standards and norms in pursuit of a new order of its own making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MILITARY EXERCISES, HARASSMENT CAMPAIGNS, AND FORWARD DEPLOYMENTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China regularly uses the threat and disruption that results from military exercises, harassment campaigns, and forward deployments to coerce and intimidate neighboring states and to assert its claims of sovereignty, all under the guise of routine military activity. This section describes the use of each of these activities to advance Chinese interests and provides examples of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, China regularly conducts large-scale, cross-service military exercises that serve as a threat to other regional countries and that frequently block sea and air lanes and disrupt commercial activity in the South China Sea. These are often strategically timed to serve as retaliation or punishment. In August 2022, for example, Beijing initiated its largest-ever military exercise — including the use of fighter jets, military helicopters, anti-submarine aircraft, combat ships, and Dongfeng-class ballistic missiles — around Taiwan in response to U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, which China perceived as a violation of its sovereignty. This exercise served not only as an overt signal that China rejects Taiwan’s sovereignty but also disrupted 18 flight paths as well as commercial shipping routes used by manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLAAF, PLAN, China Coast Guard (CCG), and other PLA-linked forces also conduct patrols and air operations — including with unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) — in disputed territories. Through these efforts, the Chinese military has regularly harassed commercial activities, including around the Spratly Islands, Taiwan Strait, and other locations in the South China Sea. Beginning in June 2019, for example, CCG patrols harassed and initiated a standoff with Malaysian and Vietnamese vessels conducting surveying and drilling operations in oil and gas fields in the South China Sea. The PLAAF has even buzzed — flown over very close and quickly — adversaries’ aircraft, including outside of Chinese airspace. In one case, described by U.S. Air Force brigadier general Pat Ryder in March 2023, a Chinese aircraft flew within 20 feet of a U.S. military plane while in international airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China regularly forward deploys troops and equipment in disputed territories, including anchoring ships, particularly in the South China Sea. As part of this effort, it also establishes military or dual-use bases on constructed islands, as described earlier in this chapter. For example, Mischief Reef — depicted previously in Figure 7.3 — has been fully militarized to include hangars, runways, seaports, warehouses, storage facilities, and radar systems. The facilities are equipped with HQ-9B surface-to-air missiles and YJ-12B anti-ship cruise missiles, close-in weapon system emplacements, Type 022 Houbei-class fast-attack boats, and other military equipment. Similarly, the PLA has developed and staffed facilities along the disputed China-India border in the Ladakh region to prepare for future conflict, facilitate the logistics of troop and equipment transfers in the disputed region, and intimidate India. In the fall of 2022, for example, despite publicly coordinating with the Indian government for joint withdrawals from the Gogra-Hotsprings border area, China continued to develop and expand its long-term military presence 50 km south of the withdrawal point, at Pangong Tso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PEOPLE’S ARMED FORCES MARITIME MILITIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PAFMM is a fleet of ostensibly commercial fishing ships that operate as an independent reserve force and serve as an “assistant to the PLAN” (解放军的助手) in the South China Sea. China has used the PAFMM since at least 1974, when militia ships helped to seize the Paracel Islands from Vietnamese control. But the PAFMM escalated its aggression against competitor ships in the 2000s and increased its collaboration with other Chinese forces to enforce claims of sovereignty in the 2010s. Since China completed a series of artificial island construction projects in the mid-2010s around the Spratly Islands, the PAFMM has regularly participated in law enforcement missions alongside the CCG and People’s Armed Police (PAP) in the region, including in efforts to harass and impede other nations’ commercial vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Chinese government has long defined its militia fleet as “an armed mass organization composed of civilians retaining their regular jobs,” it is important to understand the PAFMM as a direct tool of the government. The PAFMM works in close cooperation with the PLAN, and like all entities operating within China, it is ultimately an instrument for the Chinese government to use to pursue its interests. Given that the PAFMM has not only survived but sustained a key role in Chinese operations in the South China Sea through an assortment of PLAN modernization efforts, some U.S. experts speculate that Beijing may continue to develop and rely on the PAFMM alongside its other PLAN and CCG forces, and it may even rely on the militia as a cheaper option for low-intensity operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of ships in the PAFMM: professional and commercial. Professional “Maritime Militia Fishing Vessels” (MMFVs, or 海上民兵渔船) are built and equipped for the purpose of carrying out maritime military missions on behalf of the Chinese government. The commercial vessels, or “Spratly Backbone Fishing Vessels” (SBFVs, or 南沙骨干渔船), are owned by small or medium enterprises located along the Chinese coast that meet certain size and power requirements to be eligible to participate in militia activities. SBFVs receive payment from the Chinese government to remain present in designated disputed waters — typically with minimal crew onboard to reduce costs since the resulting profit renders fishing activities unnecessary — and to assist the PLA as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most vessels that constitute the PAFMM receive at least one type of central or local government subsidy. MMFVs receive subsidies for professional-grade construction, SBFVs receive subsidies for fuel if they operate around the Spratlys, and either type of vessel is eligible for subsidies that cover general construction, communication, navigation, and safety gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PAFMM has grown more assertive over the past decade, and it regularly works alongside the CCG and in coordination with the PLAN to assert China’s sovereign claims in the South China Sea, particularly around the Spratly Islands. As many as 300 PAFMM vessels are active in the Spratly Islands on an average day, and they regularly trespass within EEZs, harass other vessels, and violate various other international laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PAFMM allows China to assert and defend its sovereign claims, secure resources, coerce neighboring states, limit freedom of navigation, and extend its economic and military reach. These actions are all under the guise of civilian fishing activity, which may limit the threat perception of China’s adversaries or their ability to respond to PAFMM activities. Weaker states may hesitate to confront PAFMM vessels out of fear of provoking an aggressive response from China, while stronger powers may hesitate over the risk of inadvertently confronting a civilian vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2019, for example, a fleet of approximately 275 militia vessels surrounded Sandy Cay, a disputed set of three sand bars located near the Spratly Islands and between Thitu Island (occupied by the Philippines) and Subi Reef (occupied by China). To avoid the state-on-state escalation that would occur if an official CCG vessel that routinely patrols the area were to engage a Philippine vessel, civilian PAFMM vessels harassed Philippine ships in an attempt to coerce them to withdraw, which ultimately led the Philippines to denounce China in April 2019. China refused to withdraw the vessels. But in March 2022, the Philippines launched efforts to begin pushing Chinese vessels out of the waters near Thitu and away from other segments of the Philippine EEZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PAFMM vessels are also ideally positioned to assist with intelligence-gathering operations. Their ongoing presence in contested regions enables these vessels to regularly collect intelligence and monitor adversaries’ activities. Furthermore, in a combat scenario, their size and minimal signal broadcasts make PAFMM vessels difficult to detect, thus enabling them to conduct reconnaissance missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ELECTRONIC WARFARE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning in roughly 2018, China expanded its use of electronic warfare to spoof and jam navigation systems in pursuit of its political interests. Spoofing refers to a technique in which an attacker generates a fake signal and tricks a receiver into believing that the signal is genuine. Jamming refers to the process of generating noise in a specific radio frequency in order to interfere with signals traveling to or from satellites. Broadly, these techniques pose navigational risks, can disrupt shipping lanes, and may conceal criminal activity. The primary objectives of these activities appear to be to obscure imports and infrastructure in Chinese ports and to force shipping vessels and aircraft away from Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has used these types of electronic warfare both at domestic ports and throughout the South China Sea. Shipping vessels have reported patterns of Global Navigational Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing at more than 20 Chinese ports since 2019, including Shanghai. With China’s BeiDou Navigation Satellite System operational, Beijing may be emboldened to interfere more with GNSS since Chinese vessels can instead rely on BeiDou. Nearly three-quarters of these spoofing operations center on oil terminals, while the remainder include government offices and a major infrastructure company. This obfuscation may be an attempt to conceal imports of Iranian oil and the visits of high-profile government officials. In the South China Sea, Chinese government and military facilities — including those installed on artificially constructed territory in locations such as the Spratly Islands and Mischief Reef — have routinely used jamming and spoofing technology since at least 2018 to obscure their presence and to redirect foreign vessels away from contested territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of electronic warfare technology could also create additional threats beyond the recorded spoofing and jamming incidents. For example, the Chinese military could use manipulated signals to draw a target vessel off course — a technique known as “meaconing” — and instead lure it to an alternative location for nefarious purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;far-seas-activities&quot;&gt;FAR-SEAS ACTIVITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese far-seas activities use tools similar to those employed in its near-seas operations. But rather than pursuing goals related to defense or sovereignty, these activities aim to advance China’s geopolitical and economic reach worldwide, including in Latin America and Africa. This section outlines three such tools: private security companies, strategy-driven research, and the Global Security Initiative. It also examines the nature of these tools and their relationship with the Chinese government, their recent activities, and the results and implications of their use for China’s global objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private security companies (PSCs) include organizations available for hire to provide security and protection services, typically for static personnel and assets or on escort trips. PSCs are not exclusively a Chinese phenomenon, but Beijing has increasingly used them in recent years to protect Chinese nationals and property abroad and to build security-based partnerships, particularly as it continues to expand its BRI investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern PSCs began to form in China in the early 1990s as a mechanism to protect mainland companies from theft and worker revolts. Nearly three decades later, more than 5,000 PSCs operate within China and employ roughly 3 million employees. After China launched the BRI, both Chinese personnel and assets faced growing security challenges, and the demand for Chinese PSCs also increased globally. As the Chinese Ministry of Commerce explained in its 2018 update to the guidelines that regulate overseas enterprises and personnel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With China’s changing participation in global governance and the implementation of the “Belt and Road” cooperation initiative, the scale of China’s outbound investment and cooperation is expanding, and the number of people going abroad each year is increasing. . . . The international situation is increasingly complex and volatile, and various kinds of overseas security risks occur from time to time, which not only affect the overseas operation of our enterprises, but also seriously threaten our overseas personnel. . . . Since 2012, security incidents against Chinese institutions and personnel in high-risk areas abroad have been frequent, and it is urgent to enhance and strengthen the security risk prevention capability of overseas institutions and personnel of Chinese enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few of China’s domestic PSCs had the capability to shift their work abroad, but the ones that did — roughly 20 companies — increasingly took advantage of the chance to contract with entities linked to the Chinese government and its BRI investments. Most are relatively small — on the scale of a few hundred or a few thousand personnel — but expansion follows success, and in recent years some companies have grown by acquiring former competitors. This section focuses only on the activities of Chinese PSCs operating abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PSCs are technically distinct from private military companies (PMCs), which are military contractors for hire, more colloquially thought of as mercenaries. In practice, however, the distinction can be murky. While PMCs are not legal in China, the CCP formally legalized PSCs in September 2009, and the following year the Ministry of Commerce released strict regulations and requirements to govern PSC activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after the legalization of PSCs, however, legal restrictions on their activities abroad have remained murky. The Ministry of Commerce regulations predominantly govern PSCs’ domestic activities. While there are legal restrictions on PSC activities abroad during active conflicts, typical overseas operations remain largely unregulated. One significant area of ambiguity is contractors’ ability to carry firearms. Officially this is forbidden, but the Chinese government has permitted some PSCs, such as Hua Xin Zhong An (Beijing) Security Services, to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese government agencies, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and smaller entities that contract with SOEs regularly employ Chinese PSCs for protection and assistance in their overseas ventures. The size and scope of PSC foreign deployments grew over the past decade alongside BRI activities. Amid this expansion and the heightened demand for security services abroad, the Chinese government and insurance sector began to organize the PSC sector into a more formal, professionalized marketplace. International presence and experience will likely be seen as a boon for professionalizing PSC personnel, many of whom are PLA or PAP veterans who lack the knowledge and managerial skills needed to succeed or Singaporean contractors lacking language fluency and cultural knowledge. Since the private security sector and the PLA are undergoing reform simultaneously, it is possible that the Chinese government will coordinate further development and restructuring efforts for each to make the two more interoperable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Appendix provides examples of major Chinese PSCs that operate outside of China, sample locations in which they have been reported to operate, the types of services they provide, and some of their known clients. This list is not exhaustive, but it is representative of major PSC entities and activities based on open-source information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Appendix indicates, most Chinese PSC activity is focused on supporting other Chinese entities as they operate abroad, with an emphasis on economic and development activities. The companies’ tasks focus on defensive security services — including physical security, security training, and security escort services — and consulting on logistics, risk assessment, and emergency response. In Kyrgyzstan, for example, “Zhongjun Junhong” (中军军弘安保集团) has provided security services since 2016, when the car bombing at the Chinese embassy in Bishkek raised concerns about regional security. Most recently, the PSC contracted with the China Railway Group, which is working to establish the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan Railway. Similarly, in Kenya, “Beijing DeWe Security Service Group” (德威国际安保集团) provides security for China’s embassy, and additional support for Chinese-backed development projects in Kenya comes from Zhongjun Junhong, “China Security Technology Group” (中国安保技术集团), “Frontier Services Group” (先锋服务集团), and “Shandong Huawei Security Group” (山东华威保安集团).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support role of Chinese PSCs stands in stark contrast to Russian PMCs, which often serve as proxies and force multipliers for Moscow, with a growing emphasis on offensive combat training and operations. As a result, Chinese PSC operations are understudied in the United States and other Western countries. Rather than directly pursuing political and military goals as a substitute for formal military forces, Chinese PSCs facilitate economic and political influence through a security pathway. Chinese security and training services are yet another way to spread trust and influence abroad, particularly with nations that Beijing is already courting through diplomatic and economic partnerships. Even if the activities conducted by a given PSC are not directly related to China’s geopolitical goals, they present an additional threat vector that allows Beijing to build nontraditional security and political relationships through market forces. Simultaneously, PSC activities protect Chinese business and economic interests — providing both an additional benefit and a plausible justification for their routine use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most significantly, the use of PSCs to secure Chinese personnel and assets enables the longevity of Beijing’s BRI investments, most of which are in medium- to high-risk locations in which there has historically been little direct investment. The demand for security services is also unlikely to go away. Regions with heavy BRI presence, including Southeast, Central, and South Asia and East Africa, continue to face instability related to weak governance, terrorism, civil war, and interstate conflict. Beyond the security threats in these areas, Chinese firms risk being targeted as a result of cultural differences, poor working conditions, or negative externalities of their projects. By securing its assets in these regions, China is able to continue to reap the benefits of its economic investments — which are explored in greater detail in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRATEGY-DRIVEN RESEARCH EFFORTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although government-supported scientific research is routine and not typically defined as a form of warfare, the CCP’s control over the military and all government initiatives has allowed it to operationalize common research methods to gain military intelligence and influence directly connected to its strategic goals. This section details two such efforts: the use of weather balloons and scientific instruments to conduct long-range surveillance, and the use of maritime research efforts to advance China’s strategic goals in the Arctic region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long-Range Surveillance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese long-range surveillance efforts disguised as scientific research burst into the public eye on February 2, 2023, when the U.S. government publicly identified what appeared to be a weather balloon violating U.S. air space as a high-altitude Chinese surveillance platform. However, this was not an isolated incident. Similar balloons had passed over the United States in previous years, though none had previously lingered as long as this balloon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence officers have linked some of these balloon incidents to a broader PLA-led aerospace program that uses airships and balloons, which have been detected operating over five continents. In the wake of the February 2023 incident, the U.S. government imposed restrictions on U.S. companies with links to the program, effectively denying the PLA use of U.S. technology for future surveillance efforts. Still, most of the technology and resources used by the PLA for this project come from a Chinese company that participates in the nation’s civil-military fusion initiative, through which private commercial entities develop and produce technology and equipment for the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese satellites are growing in sophistication and provide extensive coverage of targets of interest within the United States and other countries. Still, balloons and airships offer some advantages: they are cheaper than satellites and can provide persistent overwatch from within the atmosphere, enabling them to gather certain types of information. Additionally, their wayward paths make them more difficult to track, and if they are detected, their appearance as standard weather balloons offers the PLA plausible deniability to conceal surveillance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strategy-Driven Maritime Research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s recent maritime research activities have included an emphasis on seabed resources and polar exploration, both of which will advance Chinese strategic priorities in addition to scientific knowledge. These focuses are aligned with Xi Jinping’s instruction to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo that “it is necessary to carry out in-depth scientific investigations in open ocean and polar regions, carry out deep-sea and far-off-shore surveys and research . . . and make preliminary preparations for the utilization of ocean and polar resources.” The Chinese government controls most of these research efforts, thereby giving the CCP influence over research priorities. The Chinese Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) owns and operates the majority of out-of-area oceanographic research vessels that constitute the state’s National Marine Research Fleet. The MNR, which reports to the State Council, formed in March 2018 as a merger of the former Ministry of Land and Resources; State Oceanic Administration; National Bureau of Surveying, Mapping, and Geological Information; and miscellaneous components of several other agencies. In addition to the MNR, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China Ocean Mineral Resources R&amp;amp;D Association operate ships within the fleet, as do various Chinese universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep-sea surveys for energy resources and minerals — particularly polymetallic nodules and sulfides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts — are one of the primary focuses of Chinese maritime research activities. China has focused its resource exploration efforts within a set of four zones in which it obtained contract rights from the International Seabed Authority. These include two areas southeast of Hawaii, one east of Guam, and another southeast of Madagascar. China’s focus on identifying and exploiting natural resources is tied to both its economic goals and ambition to become a global maritime superpower. By securing a wealth of seabed resources, China can secure its monopoly over rare-earth minerals that are key components of advanced weapons systems and other advanced technology, improve its technological and economic standing, and potentially gain an important advantage in its competition with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also increased its research focus on the polar regions, likely as a result of China’s Arctic ambitions and strategic interests. In January 2018, the State Council Information Office published a white paper titled “China’s Arctic Policy.” The white paper claimed that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . geographically, China is a ‘Near-Arctic State,’ one of the continental States that are closest to the Arctic Circle. . . . China is also closely involved in the trans-regional and global issues in the Arctic, especially in such areas as climate change, environment, scientific research, utilization of shipping routes, resource exploration and exploitation, security, and global governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s growing strategic emphasis on the Arctic stems from its perception of the region as yet another theater for global competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has used state-led research efforts to assert its presence in the Arctic and to establish sites capable of collecting intelligence on activities in the region. China maintains two permanent Arctic research stations, in Svalbard and Iceland. Although Beijing established a satellite ground station at the Esrange Space Center in Sweden in 2016, the Swedish Space Corporation declined to renew China’s contract to operate the station in 2020 amid reports of the research initiatives’ links to the PLA and intelligence-collection activities. These reports are consistent with U.S. assessments that China uses its Arctic engagements to conduct dual-use research in support of military and intelligence objectives. Moreover, this is a strategy Beijing has explicitly praised — the 2020 Science of Military Strategy identifies the mixing of civilian and military tasks in the polar regions as an ideal method for great powers to “achieve a polar military presence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Polar Research Institute of China, which operates under the oversight of the MNR, conducts much of China’s polar research with its icebreaking research vessel, &lt;em&gt;Xuelong&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Snow Dragon&lt;/em&gt;). The Xuelong completed its ninth Arctic expedition, which covered 12,500 nautical miles, in 2018. In the course of this trip, the research team deployed China’s first unmanned ice station in the Arctic as well as various types of unmanned observation equipment. In 2019, the Polar Research Institute participated in the Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition — the largest in history — alongside teams from Germany, Russia, and Sweden. Other research institutes, including the MNR’s First and Second Institutes of Oceanography, also conduct research expeditions to the polar regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLOBAL SECURITY INITIATIVE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various methods through which China asserts its military and security influence abroad — including those discussed in this chapter as well as international outreach and partnerships pursued by Chinese law enforcement — will likely tie together in Beijing’s Global Security Initiative (GSI). The GSI focuses on expanding China’s involvement in international security governance and conflict resolution, and it serves as a link between Chinese domestic security policy and foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping announced the GSI in his opening remarks at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference in April 2022, explaining that this initiative proposed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . to stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and work together to maintain world peace and security; stay committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, uphold non-interference in internal affairs, and respect the independent choices of development paths and social systems made by people in different countries; stay committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, reject the Cold War mentality, oppose unilateralism, and say no to group politics and bloc confrontation; stay committed to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously, uphold the principle of indivisible security, build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and oppose the pursuit of one’s own security at the cost of others’ security; stay committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation, support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises, reject double standards, and oppose the wanton use of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction; stay committed to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains, and work together on regional disputes and global challenges such as terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity and biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s announcement of the GSI was largely overshadowed at the time by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but the Chinese government continued to develop the concept. For example, researchers at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations — a think tank affiliated with the MSS that exerts strong influence over state and party foreign policy decisions — conceptualized the GSI as an effort to demonstrate “China’s shouldering responsibilities as a major country.” An important goal was to respond to traditional and non-traditional security challenges and to ensure “continuation and development of China’s traditional culture and wisdom and an integration and innovation of international security thinking with Chinese characteristics” and the “sublation and transcendence of Western security theory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2023, the Chinese MFA released a white paper outlining the core principles of the GSI and the ways in which China will promote bilateral and multilateral security cooperation with foreign governments and international institutions within the GSI framework. While much of the description provided in this paper is presented through rhetoric that emphasizes peace, inclusion, and cooperation, Beijing’s priorities imply that one of the central objectives of the GSI is to shape global security norms in pursuit of China’s own interests. While China plans to work alongside partner nations and organizations to pursue peaceful resolutions to global security challenges, Beijing will likely operationalize this initiative to promote Chinese technologies and security strategies to foreign governments. As this initiative becomes more established, it may lead Beijing to expand the use of some of its other military and security tools. For example, PSCs may be deployed to resolve security threats in a more active posture rather than serving only as guardians of Chinese personnel and assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-5&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several key takeaways from these irregular military activities, which are an important part of Chinese political warfare. Beijing relies on commercial entities and plausibly routine military activities to further its geopolitical goals, uses legal violations and new sovereign claims to erode international norms and standards, and spreads influence and projects power capabilities through its irregular military actions. While the scale and scope of these activities are concerning, the effectiveness of Beijing’s campaigns to spread geopolitical influence and assert territorial claims is somewhat limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it is notable that most security-based irregular activities rely on ostensibly commercial actors or routine military activities, providing Beijing with plausible deniability while still advancing its geopolitical goals and influence. In Chinese strategic thinking, this concept is known as military-civil fusion: “economic and social development takes into account military needs, and national defense and military modernization are deeply integrated into the economic and social development system. The strategic thinking of military-civilian integration is the inheritance and development of military-civilian dual-use, military-civilian integration, and military-civilian ideas.” Military-civil fusion strategies date back to Mao Zedong, but Xi Jinping has significantly increased China’s emphasis on both this concept and the role of the military in statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike nations such as the United States, whose civil-military relationships involve cooperation between separate entities, the Chinese government makes no distinction between civilian and government interests or control. Rather, it relies on a state-led “all-of-society” approach in which all actions and goals must strive to advance the interests of the CCP and in which the military is prioritized above civil concerns. Even the private in “private security company” is a misnomer. In China, the CCP ultimately controls all enterprises, and all companies must work toward the state’s goals. The Chinese government also requires that all security companies are either state-owned sole proprietorships or that more than half of the company’s capital be state-owned.16 Although commercial, political, and military assets are innately united in the Chinese political context, this is not necessarily the case in the countries that China targets with its irregular action, putting other nations in a more challenging legal position when determining responses to Chinese aggression. Nonetheless, it is often difficult to distinguish whether the CCP has directed commercial expansion abroad or if it is seizing the opportunity to capitalize on existing commercial interests both regionally and abroad — or some combination of the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China intentionally and repeatedly violates international norms and legal standards during its irregular military activities — either directly or through the operations of Chinese corporations. These infractions include EEZ incursions and other challenges to national sovereignty, economic and environmental harms, and violation of international agreements governing maritime activities (including those which China has ratified). These activities raise substantial regional concerns about sovereignty, economic rights and access, environmental protection, and freedom of movement. China likely will also continue to use lawfare strategies to challenge international law, established global norms, and the rules-based international order in favor of a reimagined system tailored to Beijing’s own needs and ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Chinese irregular military actions allow Beijing to project influence — whether benevolently through research cooperation or coercively through violations of sovereignty and theft of resources — and economic and military strength. None of these actions are intended to start a regular military conflict. In Xi Jinping’s words, the Chinese government seeks to “resolutely safeguard China’s maritime rights and interests” and build the nation into a “maritime superpower.” Irregular action to reinvent geographic boundaries, influence opinion, and mold international norms in China’s favor allows the state to advance its own strategic and political objectives at relatively low risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-coercion&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC COERCION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The [Belt and Road] Initiative is harmonious and inclusive. It advocates tolerance among civilizations, respects the paths and modes of development chosen by different countries, and supports dialogues among different civilizations on the principles of seeking common ground while shelving differences and drawing on each other’s strengths, so that all countries can coexist in peace for common prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-action-plan-on-the-belt-and-road-initiative&quot;&gt;– Action Plan on the Belt and Road Initiative&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This chapter examines Chinese economic coercion, which is a key component of political warfare.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As Linda Robinson argues in her study of modern political warfare, the “tactic of economic subversion can be seen in the overlap of the diplomatic/political (routine diplomacy) and economic (trade) spheres. Political is often — but not necessarily — carried out covertly, but it must be undertaken outside the context of conventional war.” U.S. diplomat George Kennan similarly noted that economic measures are an important tool of political warfare to weaken an adversary short of armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic coercion is a tool of political warfare as old as diplomacy itself and not one unique to China. Indeed, Pericles issued the Megarian Decrees in the 5th century BCE, blocking Megara’s traders from Athenian markets in an attempt to reincorporate the city-state into the Athenian empire. The United States has also employed these tools during the Cold War. The rapid rise of China’s economy, as well as its role as the world’s largest manufacturer and the world’s largest economy on a purchasing power parity basis, affords it unprecedented economic power to use for diplomatic and political ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government views economic competition over emerging technologies as a central pillar of competition with the United States. Within that context, Beijing views the ability to influence global standards and leverage economic partnerships as a means to shape the economic “battlefield” to gain an advantage over the United States and other competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is particularly well placed to employ coercive economic tools due to several features of its economic system beyond its sheer size. Chinese leaders have both the willingness and ability to employ domestic capital for political ends by, for example, directing the investment of its numerous state-owned enterprises. This extends to China’s private firms as well. One survey of China’s 100 largest private firms by revenue found that 95 of their founders or de facto heads belonged to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) organs, a decision that signals allegiance to China and maintains important relationships with state political agents. Because of the networked nature of China’s economic sector that encompasses levers of state power, China faces fewer obstacles to directing capital flows in coercive ways than in more liberal market systems. Moreover, international perception of Chinese markets enhances the efficacy of Chinese economic coercion. For example, many international industries and states simply view the Chinese domestic market as too large to forego and conclude that China’s meteoric economic growth will impose large future costs should an industry go against China in the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic coercion is multifaceted, and elements of it are captured in adjacent terms such as “geo-economics” and “economic statecraft.” As used in this chapter, economic coercion is defined as the implied, threatened, or actual imposition of economic costs in order to weaken a target. A state, in this case China, can use a variety of economic levers as part of political warfare. This may include implementing trade restrictions, such as sanctions and boycotts, or taking an action that inflicts negative second-order economic effects, such as imposing limits on the number of Chinese tourists to a country. While these tools are regularly employed as part of standard international trade, the key to classifying these actions as economic coercion is through their explicit or implicit linkage to the Chinese government’s desire to expand Beijing’s influence and legitimacy, as well as weaken its adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government routinely employs various forms of economic coercion to overtly or covertly encourage political and economic dependence on China, shape standards and norms in line with CCP goals and philosophy, and punish or deter activities that run counter to its own political interests. These strategies largely seek long-term impacts, but the steady development of relationships with Chinese companies and government financial entities portends that the economic dimension of Chinese political warfare will be long-lasting and potentially highly impactful. Unlike some of China’s more overt acts, most forms of economic coercion can be plausibly denied as routine statecraft, and many — such as direct investments or provision of affordable technology — are beneficial to partner nations. With these Chinese economic activities accepted and even encouraged, Beijing is likely to continue expanding its irregular economic playbook in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explores economic coercion as practiced by China as a method of political warfare. This chapter asks two main questions: How is economic coercion understood and employed by Chinese policymakers? And what are its effects on the conduct of international politics? To do this, the chapter explores Chinese economic coercion in three contexts: Belt and Road Initiative investments, the expansion of the Digital Silk Road, and international political disputes. It concludes with key takeaways related to economic coercion as a tool of Chinese political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;belt-and-road-initiative&quot;&gt;BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI, 一带一路) — originally known as the One Belt, One Road Initiative — during state visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia in 2013. During his September 2013 speech at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan, Xi proclaimed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In order to make the economic ties between European and Asian countries closer, the mutual cooperation deeper and the development space wider, we can build the “Silk Road Economic Belt” together with an innovative cooperation model. This is an important project that will benefit all the people along the route. We can start from the following aspects, leading from point to point, from line to line, and gradually form a large regional cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2022, Beijing had reached BRI development agreements with more than 140 nations. However, as Figure 8.1 demonstrates, annual investments in BRI projects have been lower since 2020 than in the preceding years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section explores three ways in which China uses the BRI to coerce partners: leveraging political support as an unofficial condition for economic partnership, using large sums of debt to China as leverage, and capitalizing on the appeal of bilateral debt relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INVESTMENTS LEAD TO POLITICAL INFLUENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s BRI agreements allow it to reinforce existing partnerships and forge new relationships that result in additional international political support, including through the disruption of existing relationships between partner countries and Taiwan. How overtly China exchanges BRI investments for political influence varies by country type. The exchange is most overt in developing countries, where China provides development finance and in return receives political support on issues such as Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang. However, Chinese efforts to gain political influence often change as partners’ economies become more advanced. In states with mid-sized economies, China typically uses state-owned enterprises and investment funds to garner influence, while in advanced economies China’s leverage depends on state-backed funds and private investors. In less subtle cases, a country may quickly reverse its positions on issues of interest to China in conjunction with BRI agreements, clearly demonstrating the political gains that Beijing secures alongside its development endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panama, for example, severed all diplomatic relations with Taiwan and strongly endorsed the One-China Principle in June 2017. This switch — which Taiwan perceived as a significant setback to its diplomatic goals in the region — was quickly rewarded. In November 2017, Panama became the first country in the Americas to join the BRI when it reached an agreement with China to support the construction of the Panama-Chiriquí Railway. During the same year, the Panamanian government awarded contracts to Chinese companies to construct a cruise terminal at the Pacific end of the Panama Canal and a container port and liquid natural gas plant at the Atlantic end. Various development projects along the canal continued to receive heavy investments from Chinese firms in subsequent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in September 2019, the Solomon Islands ended its relationship with Taiwan and established official ties with China. Shortly thereafter, four cabinet officials who had opposed the switch were removed from office, and a fifth resigned. Within weeks, Prime Minister Manasseh Damukana Sogavare traveled to Beijing and signed five memorandums of understanding (MOUs), including a formal BRI partnership agreement. China agreed to construct a multimillion-dollar stadium for the 2023 Pacific Games and infrastructure projects in support of the redevelopment of the Solomons’ most lucrative gold mine. In addition, the state-owned conglomerate China Sam Enterprise Group signed an agreement with the Tulagi provincial government for exclusive rights to the entirety of the island territory, though this agreement was later overturned. Subsequent agreements between China and the Solomon Islands have included the deployment of Chinese law enforcement and military personnel and a contract for Huawei to construct telecommunications towers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifts in policy positions in partner countries may or may not be mandated by their MOUs with China; they can also result from political pressure to maintain positive relationships and avoid reprisal from China. For an example of how China responds when one of its partners takes political actions that run counter to its interests — such as violating the One-China Princple — see the discussion of Lithuania later in this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEBT TRAPS AND FINANCIAL LEVERAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2020, China had lent roughly $1.5 trillion in loans and grants to more than 150 countries — making it the world’s largest creditor, with claim to more than 5 percent of global GDP. As China’s BRI vision came to life, however, there were strings attached. Chinese loans not only often mandate the use of Chinese workers, result in ineligibility for multilateral financial management mechanisms, and demand political support for China, they have also sometimes pulled recipients into a “debt trap,” whereby the existence of the debt itself can be used as leverage for China to secure its own political or economic gains. The 15 BRI partner countries most in debt to China, as measured by the ratio of long-term debt owed (to China) to gross national income (GNI), are detailed in Figure 8.2. Angola, which has the second-highest debt to GNI ratio, also has the second-largest total debt owed to China — it owed $22 billion in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large debts to China leave countries vulnerable to manipulation. In 2021, due to the country’s large debt owed to China, Laos approved a 25-year concession agreement between Électricité du Laos and China Southern Power Grid Company that allows the latter, a majority Chinese-owned company, to control the Laotian national power grid, including electricity exports. Hydropower accounts for more than four-fifths of Laotian electricity generation, and the concession agreement may also impact the country’s dams and water resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most well-known example of this “debt-trap diplomacy” is that of Sri Lanka. After the government defaulted on Chinese loans for the development of the Hambantota port, the Sri Lankan government granted China a 99-year lease for control of the port and 15,000 acres of surrounding land in December 2017. In the years since, China’s leverage over Sri Lanka has only strengthened. With its debt crisis growing, Sri Lanka accepted a $3 billion loan from China in 2020 to manage its existing debts, opting for the easier path of Chinese support over International Monetary Fund debt restructuring or the austerity measures required by the Paris Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing debate among Western analysts over how intentionally malicious Chinese lending is and whether “debt trap” is a fair descriptor. Researchers have correctly pointed out that each case of lending is nuanced, with many partner nations seeking Chinese investment and multiple factors contributing to financial distress. Regardless of the level of premeditation, however, Chinese loans — including their uniquely opaque and restrictive terms — create political and economic leverage that China uses to shape the geopolitical environment to its advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEBT RELIEF AND FORGIVENESS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has historically limited debt relief options available to its partners, including explicitly forbidding participation in some international debt management efforts, such as the Paris Club, as one of the terms of its BRI contracts. When it does engage in debt relief or forgiveness, Beijing prefers to operate through bilateral arrangements to maintain control of all terms and conditions. Recently, economic stresses related to the Covid-19 pandemic increased both the demand for and frequency of approval for debt relief or forgiveness — agreements that can improve international perception of China and incentivize BRI partner countries to continue economic partnerships with China. Some analysts have assessed that these decisions may specifically aim to manage the “public relations nightmare” of claims of debt-trap diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his 2021 speech at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, Xi Jinping announced that “China will exempt African LDCs [least developed countries] from debt incurred in the form of interest-free Chinese government loans due by the end of 2021.” This forgiveness applied to 23 interest-free loans to 17 African countries. According to estimates from the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University, the total sum of the debt forgiven was likely between $45 million and $610 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the debt cancellation from the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, there are three other primary mechanisms for debt relief from China: the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), contributions to the International Monetary Fund’s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust, and ad hoc debt relief. Within each of these mechanisms, Beijing may opt to relieve debts through renewal and refinancing, reprofiling and rescheduling, restructuring, or either partial or full forgiveness. In September 2022, for example, China agreed to restructure Ecuador’s debt by extending the maturity of loans from the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China until 2027 and 2032, respectively, resulting in relief of $1.4 billion until 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;digital-silk-road&quot;&gt;DIGITAL SILK ROAD&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First introduced as part of the standard connectivity plan for the BRI in 2015, the Digital Silk Road (DSR) aims to spread and synthesize Chinese efforts related to telecommunications, e-commerce, hardware, software, big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), the Internet of Things, and other digital infrastructure and norms. In his speech at the 2017 Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, Xi Jinping officially described the DSR as the technological component of the BRI, saying that China “should pursue innovation-driven development and intensify cooperation in frontier areas such as digital economy, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and quantum computing, and advance the development of big data, cloud computing and smart cities so as to turn them into a digital silk road of the 21st century.” Figure 8.3 provides details about the five main categories of DSR efforts as well as each category’s primary components and examples of Chinese companies that further Beijing’s goal of technological dominance and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the primary BRI investments, DSR projects are driven by private companies. Nonetheless, these companies maintain close ties to the CCP, including with regard to both goals and objectives and, in many cases, the ability to access or exploit the access granted by the technologies they sell. Still, coordination and information sharing in this ecosystem remain inconsistent and decentralized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines China’s DSR-related goals and strategies as they apply to software, hardware, and digital infrastructure as well as global standards for emerging technology. Chinese efforts to shape public opinion and the information environment are explored in greater detail in the information and disinformation chapter (Chapter 5) of this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, AND INFRASTRUCTURE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the DSR, Chinese companies have expanded their presence in the markets for software, hardware, and technological infrastructure. These different products give Beijing the ability to compete with U.S. and other Western companies in all levels of the internet technology stack, as seen in Figure 8.4. This means that Chinese companies not only provide software, applications, and services but also control the very systems that process, store, and transmit data. While user applications such as social media platforms, games, and shopping services spread influence and collect some data, control of hardware and infrastructure permits Beijing more complete access to data and surveillance as well as control over the continuation of services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of exploitation is greatest when Chinese technology companies control multiple — or all — layers of the internet technology stack. For example, after funding, designing, and helping to construct the African Union (AU) headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Beijing controlled the building’s networks, software, and hardware, including security camera systems. In 2018, the French newspaper &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt; broke allegations that China had used this access to regularly obtain confidential AU data and recordings. Beijing denied the accusation, and the AU maintained its relationship with Chinese companies to avoid damaging its relationship with Beijing. With little having changed, China was once again detected stealing data and camera footage from the AU headquarters in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLOBAL STANDARDS FOR EMERGING TECHNOLOGY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to seeking market dominance and control of information, Beijing’s DSR efforts also emphasize the importance of establishing and shaping global standards and norms for emerging technology that are in line with the CCP’s interests. Beijing has a broader agenda than simply ensuring that its companies are well positioned to compete in emerging markets. Standards carry with them norms and values, including in relation to issues of contention between the Chinese government and Western democracies, such as free speech, privacy, and surveillance. For example, Chinese companies working on AI and the Internet of Things have advanced facial recognition and surveillance technology, which the Chinese government routinely uses to monitor and suppress political dissidents and ethnic minorities. Chinese efforts to set standards to their preferences — in other words weighted toward authoritarian states’ ability to surveil populations and against personal freedoms — will allow greater freedom for Beijing to operate both at home and around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2021, the CCP released its “National Standardization Development Outline,” a white paper that laid out near- and long-term goals (to 2025 and 2035, respectively) for technological standardization. Colloquially known as “China Standards 2035,” the document called for the nation to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Strengthen standards research in key technical fields. Conduct standardized research in artificial intelligence, quantum information, biotechnology, and other fields. Utilizing the integration of informatization and industrialization for new generation information technology with broad potential for future applications such as big data, blockchain, healthcare, new energy, new materials, etc. China will simultaneously deploy technological research and development in coordination with research on and formulation of standards and their promotion in industry, to accelerate the pace of industrialization for new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pursuit of these goals, China has both expanded its participation in international standards-setting processes and has sought to establish new avenues for standards development. For example, Chinese companies such as ZTE and Huawei have been heavily involved in the development processes for international standards related to 5G and the Internet of Things. Outside of the mainstream standardization community, China has also explored the notion of developing its own Belt and Road Standards Forum as a parallel alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Beijing prioritizes the expansion of initiatives such as the DSR, which aim to reshape global norms and standards, the best opportunity for the United States and its allies to counter Chinese strategy may be to establish a united democratic alternative. This is further complicated by differences in standards and inconsistent priorities between other leading nations, including the United States and EU members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-sanctions-and-punishment-in-political-disputes&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AND PUNISHMENT IN POLITICAL DISPUTES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China frequently employs coercive economic sanctions to punish nations for taking political or economic actions that contradict Beijing’s interests and to incentivize policies that are more in line with China’s goals. While it sometimes uses traditional sanctions in higher-impact cases, Beijing frequently relies on implicit sanctions, informal boycotts, and regulatory actions to compel states to adhere to its demands. Figure 8.5 highlights examples of Chinese use of economic punishments to attempt to coerce more favorable outcomes in political disputes since 2000. The types of activities that most frequently provoke this response from Beijing include economic restrictions impacting Chinese companies, political activities that threaten Chinese claims of sovereignty, and arms sales and security activity. This section provides brief examples of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RESTRICTIONS ON CHINESE COMPANIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other states’ restrictions on the activities of Chinese companies — particularly technology companies involved in the DSR, such as Huawei — have increasingly provoked economic punishment by China. After the Australian government banned Huawei and ZTE from providing technology for 5G networks in 2018, for example, Beijing responded with both formal and informal trade restrictions on imports such as barley, beef, coal, lobster, and wine. The Chinese-Australian relationship further soured in 2020 when Australia called for an international probe into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. Ultimately, however, Chinese restrictions on Australia caused only modest and short-term economic impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some modest economic harms, this case demonstrates the mixed effects of this strategy, as China’s punishment campaign against Australia may have harmed Australian attitudes toward China. Researchers at the University of Adelaide estimated that Australia forwent $4.9 billion in export revenues due to Chinese restrictions between July 2020 and February 2021. Yet marked shifts in Australian public opinion of China also coincided with the economic dispute. Polling conducted by the Lowy Institute found that Australian public opinion toward China became increasingly negative as the China-Australia economic relationship deteriorated. In 2020, 41 percent of Australians polled perceived China as a security threat, and 55 percent saw China as an economic partner. This shifted against China in 2021, when 63 percent of participants saw China as a security threat and only 34 percent viewed China as an economic partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, this type of response also provides Beijing with the credibility to influence other states’ decisions simply by threatening to do the same to them if they act against Chinese companies. For example, in 2019, as Germany contemplated excluding Huawei from its next-generation 5G network, the Chinese ambassador to Germany warned that “there will be consequences. The Chinese government will not stand idly by” and threatened action against the German automotive industry, which relies heavily on Chinese markets. Germany relented and declined to prohibit Huawei, which by late 2022 accounted for 59 percent of German 5G radio access network equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHALLENGES TO SOVEREIGNTY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also used economic coercion against countries in response to actions that challenge perceptions of Chinese sovereignty, including issues of political legitimacy and territorial control. Examples include supporting the governments or people of Taiwan, Tibet, and Hong Kong; disregarding Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea; supporting political dissidents; and criticizing Beijing’s record of human rights violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in July 2021, the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Taiwan would establish a “Taiwanese Representative Office” in Lithuania later that year. While the office does not have diplomatic accreditation, it functions as a de facto embassy — similar to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States. The decision to permit the office to use the name “Taiwan” rather than “Taipei” sparked fierce condemnation from Chinese authorities. In August 2021, Beijing recalled its ambassador to Lithuania and demanded that the Lithuanian ambassador be recalled as well, charging that the decision to support Taiwan “severely undermines China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” As Lithuania allowed the creation of the Taiwanese Representative Office to move forward, its economic and diplomatic relationship with China continued to deteriorate. China suspended Lithuanian visas and restricted trade between the two countries, including by delisting Lithuania as a country of origin and directly prohibiting imports of Lithuanian beef, dairy, and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also introduced secondary sanctions against firms that purchase products from Lithuanian companies. This development provoked criticism from the Lithuanian tech industry, which was most heavily impacted. For example, Kristijonas Vizbaras, cofounder of the laser manufacturer the Brolis Group, complained that the laser industry had “been sacrificed for this ‘value-based’ policy,” and unless the situation changed, companies like his would no longer be able to operate in Lithuania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ARMS SALES AND SECURITY ACTIVITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China has enacted other coercive economic measures in response to defense and security activities that undermine Chinese goals or have the capacity to threaten Chinese territorial claims. Examples include arms sales, security cooperation negotiations or agreements, and military deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, Beijing has responded with targeted sanctions on arms manufacturers. For example, after the United States approved a $2.2 billion arms sale to Taiwan in 2019 — including 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks, 250 Stinger missiles, and other equipment — China responded with sanctions against the U.S. manufacturing companies involved in the deal. Typically, however, these measures target other nations to compel them to decline security assistance from the United States and its allies or to otherwise de-escalate military activities that could potentially constrain Chinese interests. When South Korea — in partnership with the United States — deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense platform in 2016 to guard against North Korea, China lodged an official diplomatic complaint against South Korea, imposed restrictions on South Korean tourists, forced the closure of a company involved in securing the THAAD deployment site, cut subsidies, and generated additional regulatory hurdles for South Korean companies. China’s economic punishment against South Korea dragged into the following year, until South Korean president Moon Jae-in relented to Beijing’s pressure and publicly affirmed that his country would follow the “Three Nos” policy. President Moon Jae-in promised that South Korea would not deploy additional THAAD systems, would not participate in a missile defense network led by the United States, and would not enter into a trilateral military alliance with the United States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-6&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic coercion is a viable means of political warfare. In addition to the direct geopolitical gains China secures through economic coercion — including leverage and the spread of influence — Beijing also uses these forms of outreach to create dependencies on China, particularly in the developing world. Examples include vying for relationships with U.S. partners. Despite India’s close security relationship with the United States, China has cultivated a strong economic relationship with India. Affordability is India’s primary concern with regard to emerging technologies, so the Indian government relies on Chinese companies for a large portion of its data and telecommunications equipment and infrastructure. As long as China remains able to offer cheap options to developing countries, these countries will depend on Chinese technologies and will be motivated to maintain positive relationships with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s wide range of coercive economic activities demonstrate, economic competition likely will involve an integrated, whole-of-society approach, including policy and norms, information, finance and trade, infrastructure, and all layers of the technology stack. At the same time, China likely will continue to wield both investments and economic punishments such as sanctions to keep partner nations invested in the Chinese global economic project, dependent on Beijing’s support and infrastructure, and behaving in line with Chinese sovereign claims and geopolitical goals. Beijing is likely to continue to focus on economic tools useful for economic competition, particularly if some of its more overtly malicious pathways are challenged or restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;countering-china&quot;&gt;COUNTERING CHINA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The most comprehensive and serious challenge to U.S. national security is the PRC’s coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor to refashion the Indo-Pacific region and the international system to suit its interests and authoritarian preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-us-national-defense-strategy-2022&quot;&gt;– U.S. National Defense Strategy (2022)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The PRC is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. Beijing has ambitions to create an enhanced sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and to become the world’s leading power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-us-national-security-strategy-2022&quot;&gt;– U.S. National Security Strategy (2022)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;China is engaged in extensive and aggressive political warfare across the globe, including in the U.S. homeland.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; These actions are perpetrated by such organizations as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), Ministry of State Security (MSS), Ministry of Public Security (MPS), Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, United Front Work Department, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A wide range of non-state or quasi-state actors, from hacktivists to private security companies, support the official acts of the state. The primary tools of Chinese political warfare include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s intelligence services, such as the MSS and MPS, are engaged in extensive intelligence activity to expand Chinese power and influence. In examining over 100 Chinese espionage cases directed at the United States or U.S. entities, this report concludes that the United States has suffered substantial losses in terms of trade secrets, military technology, sensitive data on U.S. citizens, classified U.S. government information, and harassment of individuals — including members of the Chinese diaspora — residing in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese organizations, including units within the PLA, are involved in an aggressive cyber campaign against corporations, universities, government agencies, media, think tanks, nongovernmental organizations, and other targets to advance China’s interests. On the economic front, these efforts are designed to help China leapfrog ahead of the West by skipping the extensive and time-consuming research and development phases for new technologies. Chinese cyber operations are also designed to enable influence campaigns on domestic and international audiences, collect information, assist with potential offensive military campaigns, and improve China’s artificial intelligence and big data analytics capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information and Disinformation Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; China is engaged in numerous activities overseas — including in the U.S. homeland — to influence decisionmaking and popular support to gain a competitive advantage. Beijing seeks to tightly control the image of China abroad, including by influencing companies, organizations, and individuals that criticize China, from the National Basketball Association to Hollywood studios. While there has been self-censorship in Hollywood to avoid antagonizing Beijing, the two most successful movies of all time in China both involve wars against the United States: &lt;em&gt;The Battle at Lake Changjin&lt;/em&gt; (2021) and &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior 2&lt;/em&gt; (2017).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United Front Work:&lt;/strong&gt; The CCP is involved in numerous efforts to extend its reach overseas through united front work, which involves activity to protect and bolster the image of China and the CCP. Led by the United Front Work Department, this activity has targeted U.S. universities, news media, ethnic Chinese abroad, and others inside of the United States and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular Military Actions:&lt;/strong&gt; The PLA, PLA Navy, PLA Air Force, PLA Rocket Forces, People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia, and private security companies linked to China are involved in widespread efforts to expand Chinese influence. These organizations are involved in near-seas activities (which focus on securing Chinese interests in such areas as the South and East China Seas) and far-seas activities (which are global in scope). According to CSIS estimates, there are nearly two dozen Chinese private security companies operating overseas, including in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Coercion:&lt;/strong&gt; China is increasingly engaged in the threat or imposition of economic sanctions or inducements to influence decisionmaking to gain a competitive advantage. There are a wide range of examples of Chinese economic coercion, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Digital Silk Road (DSR). The latter aims to create — and use as political leverage — Chinese global expansion in telecommunications, e-commerce, hardware, software, big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning, the Internet of Things, and other digital infrastructure and norms across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has several strategic goals in conducting these activities. The most important include preserving the CCP, expanding Chinese power and influence, and weakening the United States as part of balance-of-power competition. China’s broader strategy aims to pursue modernization to expand its military might, economic power, and technological prowess; improve its governance; and revise the international order in support of Beijing’s system of governance and national interests. In addition, China also conducts political warfare — rather than armed conflict — in an attempt to avoid conventional war and limit security concerns from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter examines ways that the United States and its partners can compete with China below the threshold of conventional warfare. It asks: What options do the United States and its partners have to counter Chinese political warfare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has been slow to identify the broad range of Chinese activities and has failed to develop a systematic strategy to oppose them, this chapter outlines several core components of a strategy to counter Chinese political warfare and compete more effectively. U.S. policy should include checking China’s global expansion by competing on a sustained basis; encouraging a progression toward a pluralistic political system in China that respects human rights; developing economically viable alternatives to Chinese influence over third countries, in particular in the global south; and engaging in diplomatic negotiations with China to keep communication channels open and reach agreements that protect and enhance U.S. interests where feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter focuses on five steps that are critical to compete with China below the threshold of conventional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leverage-democratic-principles-as-an-alternative-to-ccp-authoritarianism&quot;&gt;LEVERAGE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CCP AUTHORITARIANISM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition today is to a great extent a balance-of-power struggle between rival political, economic, and military systems. China under Xi Jinping is one of the most authoritarian countries in the world, according to the nonpartisan organization Freedom House; eschews a free press; and has become more sophisticated and aggressive in using coercive tactics to shape media narratives and suppress reporting that is critical of China and the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has blocked information by creating a “Great Firewall.” As one human rights report concluded in 2022, “China was the world’s worst environment for internet freedom for the eighth consecutive year.” China’s digital firewall has blocked or censored hundreds of thousands of websites, apps, and services that the government has assessed contain content unfavorable to China, including Google, YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, Wikipedia, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and numerous virtual private network providers. The country has detained and jailed journalists, human rights activists, religious leaders, and civilians for sharing online content critical of the Chinese government. It has also tightened control over China’s technology sector and enforced rules that require digital platforms to utilize their algorithms to promote CCP ideology. China has also increasingly attempted to expand its authoritarianism on digital networks across the globe, triggering what some have termed “digital authoritarianism.” As one declassified U.S. intelligence assessment concluded, “China and other authoritarian governments are using cyber espionage, attacks, and influence operations to extend the coercive reach of their ideological enforcement and political control efforts beyond their borders. In some cases, they are impinging on Western democracies’ sovereignty and interests to enhance their domestic stability.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its democratic partners have categorically different systems. Freedom — of the ballot box, the press, religion, and commerce — is at the core of Enlightenment values. As the English philosopher John Locke argued, reason “teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions.” The United States’ democratic principles are outlined in the preamble to the Constitution: “to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.” The United States and its partners should counter Chinese political warfare by supporting these democratic principles and combating authoritarianism across the globe and on all forums, from digital platforms and the internet to corporate boardrooms, educational institutions, and the halls of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are several pitfalls that U.S. policymakers need to avoid. First, they need to stay clear of the McCarthyism of the 1940s and 1950s, which involved false or unproven public accusations of subversion and treason. Countering China’s intelligence operations, information and disinformation operations, united front work, economic coercion, and other activities — including in the U.S. homeland — is critical. But it must be based on facts, judicial oversight, and democratic principles. Such evidence must also be transparently communicated to the American public, who are increasingly the target of China’s operations, particularly in the information and commercial spheres. Second, the United States needs to avoid taking actions overseas that are inconsistent with U.S. democratic principles and are bound to be counterproductive and ineffective. During the Cold War, for example, the United States was involved in overthrowing — or attempting to overthrow — several regimes (such as Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, and Chile in 1973) and orchestrating covert action programs (such as the 1983 mining of several Nicaraguan harbors) that ultimately undermined U.S. interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;understand-china&quot;&gt;UNDERSTAND CHINA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to better understand how China views competition with the United States. What are China’s objectives in utilizing political warfare? What are its main instruments? What vulnerabilities and weaknesses of China can be exploited?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this report highlights, a close analysis of Chinese activity indicates that Beijing has conducted a broad political warfare campaign against the United States and its partners across the globe. To conduct these actions, Beijing invests substantial resources in understanding the United States, including in translating documents and exploring the contours of U.S. culture and politics. The China International Communications Group, which is owned and operated by the CCP’s Central Propaganda Department, distributes the CCP line on numerous issues to overseas audiences, directs research on foreign media, and conducts language training programs. The English-language training market in China was approximately $75 billion in China in 2022. Some analysis estimates that the market for English-language training in China will increase by over $70 billion between 2021 and 2025. In contrast, the market size for all language instruction in the United States was only $1.5 billion in 2022. Even though China has a much larger population than the United States, Beijing still spends roughly 14 times more per capita on English language training than the United States does on all language training. More broadly, the U.S. government and private sector have failed to invest in the language skills and expertise to effectively compete with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. leaders during the Cold War would have been horrified at this discrepancy. The U.S. government invested significant resources in conducting information campaigns and translating Soviet documents into English. Among the most important organizations was the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, which monitored, translated, and disseminated massive amounts of news from the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries. Researchers, activists, journalists, policymakers, and the public relied on its invaluable translations. When the Cold War ended, however, the United States slashed the budgets for these types of organizations. In 2019, the U.S. government shut down all outside access to the Open Source Enterprise, the successor of the Foreign Broadcast Information Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still time to change. One step is to build a twenty-first century open-source information service. The United States should start by having the Open Source Enterprise, embedded in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)’s Directorate of Digital Innovation, make its translations of Chinese material publicly available, as the Foreign Broadcast Information Service did during the Cold War. In the absence of such efforts, the private sector has taken the lead in translating Chinese material, though China has made access to material more difficult by expanding its anti-espionage laws and restricting overseas access to China-based data sources. For national security issues, some of the best examples are CSIS’s &lt;em&gt;Interpret: China&lt;/em&gt;, the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University, and the Department of the Air Force’s China Aerospace Studies Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthen-defense&quot;&gt;STRENGTHEN DEFENSE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important component of U.S. strategy needs to be conducting more effective defensive measures against Chinese political warfare. As used here, defense refers to efforts to deter, resist, blunt, and mitigate attacks from an adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is cyber. U.S. policymakers need to continue to develop a concerted effort to establish a cyber doctrine for the United States and consider how the United States’ capabilities stack up against China’s capabilities. An initial comparison reveals that China holds an advantage in one key area: the capability to hold critical infrastructure at risk. The obvious and urgent conclusion is that the United States must focus on bolstering its cyber defenses. It is currently too easy for an adversary such as China to hold at risk elements that make the U.S. economy and U.S. society function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unclassified assessment is unable to compare the most exquisite cyber tools in each nation’s arsenal, but the U.S. government should run classified simulations on how China might fight in the cyber domain and how the United States might defend itself, evaluating variables such as the availability of the Global Positioning System, internet connectivity around the United States, and redundancy of communications infrastructure in a time of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing cyber norms of behavior is also worthwhile, even if China refuses to accede. Norms should include a rejection of state-based internet protocol theft for financial gain, privacy protection for citizens, and a prohibition on targeting of critical infrastructure that supports civilian populations. Ideally, scientific exchanges would be protected across borders, with free flow of data. The 2015 agreement between U.S. president Barack Obama and Chinese leader Xi Jinping failed to create these norms, but global views have evolved. A group of like-minded nations might be willing to speak out against China’s approach and even impose costs on Beijing for undermining common-sense norms. As part of this norm-setting effort, the United States should prioritize blocking Beijing’s attempt to take control of standards-setting bodies such as the International Telecommunication Union, which is the UN agency for information and communications technologies. The last election for head of the International Telecommunication Union was a big win for democratic values, but China has been pursuing a strategy of bureaucratic takeovers for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China holds an additional advantage in its years-long pursuit of diverse datasets. It can use that data for training artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) systems or for learning how to manipulate U.S. public opinion. China’s even more comprehensive collection of data on its own population is also a ready-made roadmap to Chinese public sentiment. Targeting that internal tracking data for intelligence collection could provide a roadmap to public sentiment within China on topics from internal discontent to views on a conflict with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its partners should also work to pull even and surpass China in two critical technologies: AI/ML and quantum computing. The United States needs a revamped approach to acquiring and incorporating AI/ML capabilities in its military and intelligence planning and must establish rules for when AI/ML capabilities should be used in conflict scenarios. The faster the United States understands this technology and sets guardrails, the less likely China will be able to define the field and write the rules. In addition, the United States and its partners should undertake a sprint in quantum computing, which is a critical technology that could break current encryption and create stronger future encryption. The capability to read even encrypted data creates an incentive for massive theft of information today for readability tomorrow. Post-quantum encryption will be necessary to deter and counter such an effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another useful example is influence campaigns. In the United States, the creation and strengthening of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) made it possible to disclose details of several Chinese and other foreign information activities. While FARA is a useful tool for illuminating some behavior, it is by no means comprehensive. It is accompanied by separate reporting structures and databases for the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) and the Department of Education’s Section 117 disclosures, neither of which include detailed descriptions of the activities that were carried out at the behest of a foreign sponsor. Beijing has demonstrated its ability to navigate Western transparency and openness to its advantage. For example, this report documented how Beijing worked within the different confines of U.S., Australian, and UK law to advance its information interests. In the context of united front work, China generally adheres to the letter of the law, but has found ways to exploit gray areas or areas where the law is silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional challenge is developing countermeasures to combat China’s transnational repression of its citizens and diaspora communities. The tool kit for achieving these ends is limited. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Department of Justice (DOJ) have demonstrated some resolve in expanding the number of cases they are willing to pursue, including indicting a Chinese student, Xiaolei Wu, in 2022 on charges that he stalked and threatened a democracy activist in Boston. However, there are limited incentives to report such activity or protections for those who do so, particularly for foreign students and visitors who intend to return to China or have close family living in China. Many of the prominent stories of China’s transnational harassment focus on a few vocal activists. Yet there is ample evidence that these high-profile examples account for a small amount of the intimidation and suppression of free speech and academic freedom that often goes unreported out of fear of consequences for oneself and one’s family. Moreover, Chinese diaspora populations — rather than Chinese government entities — are often heavily involved in harassing and threatening other members of the diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping and the CCP have repeatedly and clearly expressed a belief that their rules legitimately extend to Chinese citizens wherever they reside or travel. Identifying the right mechanisms to deter such behavior, through a combination of punishment, awareness, and policy, is a key challenge for Western democracies to uphold the tenets of freedom of expression and to protect their sovereignty from Chinese aggression and authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective examples of a strong defense is the growing opposition to Confucius Institutes. By 2009, there were 90 Confucius Institutes housed at U.S. universities — including prestigious institutions such as Columbia, Stanford, and the University of Chicago — and a total of 440 across the globe. But the Confucius Institutes quickly became a lightning rod for controversy. At the University of Chicago, more than 100 professors signed a petition calling on the university to terminate its contract with Hanban. Bruce Lincoln, the Caroline E. Haskell distinguished service professor of the history of religions at the University of Chicago, helped lead the charge, arguing that the institute was a potentially dangerous “sort of arrangement where an entity outside the university . . . is in effect seriously influencing who’s teaching and what’s taught under our name and inside our curriculum.” By 2023, Confucius Institutes had largely disappeared on U.S. college and university campuses, with only a dozen remaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, China has shifted to other programs, such as the Thousand Talents Plan, to recruit experts in science and technology. Some academics, such as Charlie Lieber, chair of Harvard University’s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, were arrested and convicted in connection with lying to federal authorities about affiliation with the Thousand Talents Plan. Other countries, such as Canada, have also expressed alarm at China’s attempts to infiltrate universities and other institutions through the Thousand Talents Plan and other programs. As the Canadian Security Intelligence Service concluded: “Foreign talent recruitment programs are used to advance the economic and strategic objectives of foreign states at the expense of Canada’s national interests. The Thousand Talents Plan is an example of academic talent plans that are used to advance foreign states’ interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the United States can take several steps to strengthen defense against Chinese political warfare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toughen Cyber Resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; The Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cyber Infrastructure and Security Agency, which sits within the Department of Homeland Security, have made tremendous strides building consensus around strengthening cyber defenses within the U.S. government and in the private sector. But more dramatic action will be necessary to incentivize — and perhaps regulate — better cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Federal Counterintelligence Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Boost FBI, DOJ, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) resources to conduct Chinese counterintelligence operations against the MSS, MPS, PLA, United Front Work Department, and other organizations. The FBI is particularly swamped with Chinese counterintelligence cases, according to CSIS discussions with the FBI. The FBI should be given additional resources to hire more counterintelligence agents and intelligence analysts, including Mandarinproficient personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand State and Local Counterintelligence Activities:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a growing need to supplement U.S. federal efforts by expanding state and local efforts. New Jersey, for example, has stepped up counterintelligence efforts under the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness. The Analysis Bureau in New Jersey has devoted greater resources to analyzing Chinese intelligence and disinformation activities, including through cooperation with the FBI. The Analysis Bureau has also added a critical infrastructure analysis section to analyze Chinese and other foreign threats and advocate for better operational security practices. New Jersey has also distributed its products to local law enforcement agencies and the general public to increase awareness. These efforts should be widespread across states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Declassify Intelligence Analysis: There is an urgent need to increase public awareness of the Chinese threat to the U.S. homeland by declassifying more information and analysis from the U.S. intelligence community, FBI, DHS, Department of State, Department of Defense, and Department of Treasury. There have been some useful examples, such as the National Intelligence Council’s declassified “Cyber Operations Enabling Expansive Digital Authoritarianism.” But these cases are few and far between. In the 1980s, for instance, the CIA and FBI released a range of intelligence products on Soviet political warfare as part of congressional hearings. Along these lines, Congress can play an increasingly important role in raising public awareness through hearings, analytical products, and other activities — including through the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crack Down on Sensitive Technology:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a growing urgency to mitigate the threat from China’s intelligence collection and information operations on technology platforms through a combination of executive, legislative, and judicial steps. For example, TikTok should be banned from all state and local devices — not just federal ones — because it allows China to access the devices, including information, microphones, and cameras. There is also a need to contextualize public education efforts with concrete examples of negative impacts or threats to the U.S. public. This is increasingly important because China’s irregular activities directly target citizens in the United States and other Western countries via popular online social media, gaming, and e-commerce platforms, many of which are accompanied by China’s own information campaigns that extol these platforms’ benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Private Sector Awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; Intensify U.S. government interactions with corporations, educational institutions, think tanks, and other entities about China’s influence and coercive activity. Chinese influence campaigns have targeted a wide range of U.S. organizations and companies, including Hollywood movie studios and the National Basketball Association. Consequently, there is an urgent need for the FBI, DHS, and intelligence community to increase interactions with targeted institutions and to educate their personnel about evolving Chinese methods and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen FARA and Related Efforts:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a continuing need to further strengthen FARA and other efforts, including the Lobbying Disclosure Act and the Department of Education’s Section 117 disclosures, to counter Chinese and other foreign influence. Examples might include providing civil investigative demand authority to the Department of Justice, increasing penalties for non-compliance with registration requirements, and repealing or modifying FARA exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conduct-offensive-measures&quot;&gt;CONDUCT OFFENSIVE MEASURES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a letter to U.S. painter and Revolutionary War veteran John Trumbull, George Washington wrote that “offensive operations, often times, is the surest, if not the only . . . means of defence.” Political warfare with China should not only involve playing defense but also conducting offensive measures in such areas as information and cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As used here, offense refers to efforts to coerce or weaken an adversary. An offensive campaign should be based, in part, on leveraging U.S. democratic strengths and exploiting China’s weaknesses, including the vulnerabilities inherent to its attempt to suffocate political liberty, freedom of expression and the press, free-market capitalism, and freedom of religion. The fundamental goal of China’s leadership is to retain and solidify their absolute power and to eliminate any effective opposition to their authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. offensive policy toward China should focus on thwarting China’s expansionism, power, and influence as well as encouraging a more pluralistic political and economic system in China and its partners. One example of offense is in the cyber domain. The United States should have a consistently updated set of options for action and retaliation in the cyber domain. While escalation dynamics in and through the cyber domain are still up for debate, limiting activity to cyber could prove de-escalatory in a crisis. If cyber effects are predictable and damage is targeted, cyber tools can be an effective way to send a message. However, the United States and China also need to establish consistent crisis communications channels so that the two capitals can message intent effectively if a cyber operation meant to be limited and de-escalatory has unpredicted effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the United States and its partners should proactively highlight examples of China’s malign activity, human rights abuses, and corruption. Some of the best work may come from legislators, investigative journalists, academics, and corporate executives. Indeed, China has significant weaknesses and vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Examples include the BRI and DSR, which frequently aim to control information in ways that benefit China, burden foreign countries (including with debt), and rely on Chinese labor rather than local workers. China’s goal is generally to force governments and corporations to respect and defer to Chinese interests in current and future actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also engaged in significant human rights abuses. Examples include China’s involvement in the arrest, torture, and assassination of defectors, political opponents, and those investigating or prosecuting corruption and human rights abuses (such as journalists and lawyers). In addition, Chinese corruption and cheating scandals are pervasive. China has paid bribes to foreign officials to gain access to their country, and corruption is often critical for promotion in the CCP and military. China has also been embroiled in massive doping scandals with its athletes, including for the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the United States should consider several recommendations to strengthen the offense in light of Chinese political warfare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weaken the Great Firewall:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States needs to increase resources and support to programs that provide technological and other assistance to individuals and organizations inside and outside China to break through the Great Firewall. These programs should include U.S. government agencies — such as the State Department, Defense Department, and intelligence community — as well as nongovernmental organizations and the private sector. Populations generally want access to other sources of news, not just information from state-controlled media.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a Multilateral Bloc to Counter Chinese Economic Coercion:&lt;/strong&gt; Combating and deterring Chinese economic coercion will likely require a collective effort by the United States, Australia, South Korea, Japan, and other countries — including in Europe. Participant countries should be prepared to sanction China in response to Chinese threats or actions that do not conform to World Trade Organization rules and are aimed at meeting Chinese political goals unrelated to trade. In addition, participant countries could create a collective compensation fund for losses and offer alternative export or import markets to divert trade in response to Chinese sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Private Sector Competitiveness in Emerging Technology:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop a public-private partnership designed to compete more effectively with China in emerging technology in such areas as the Global South. As noted in this report, China has developed an aggressive strategy to spread Chinese technology through the DSR. The United States and allied and partner governments should develop a coordinated approach to support U.S. and allied companies that seek to compete in these same regions, such as Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a U.S. Inter-Agency Body to Coordinate Offensive Actions:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. government’s China policy is still stovepiped across such areas as diplomacy, defense, economics, and intelligence. The National Security Council should create a body that coordinates strategy and operations across U.S. government agencies designed to identify Chinese vulnerabilities and exploit them. The United States needs to proactively weaken Chinese power, influence, and relationships overseas. There are several models from the Cold War that are worth examining, such as the Active Measures Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actions will not be easy. China will respond aggressively and fiercely to any campaign designed to undermine its authoritarianism and exploit the vulnerabilities in its political and economic systems. Chinese leaders may threaten its critics, including by withholding money to — or conducting offensive cyberattacks and other actions against — corporations, educational institutions, think tanks, and other individuals and organizations. Chinese citizens and their families may be intimidated, imprisoned, tortured, or even killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offensive operations will also require leveraging defectors, émigrés, and dissidents from China — including intellectuals and scientists — for information campaigns. Soviet and Eastern European defectors and dissidents were an important tool in political warfare during the Cold War and a critical source of information. Their testimonies were helpful in constructing powerful, emotional, and truthful narratives that undermined the Soviet Union and its ideology. Defectors such as Stanislav Levchenko and Ladislav Bittman also provided critical insights into how active measures worked and how to fight back. The United States needs to find opportunities to effectively identify and exploit defectors and dissidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political warfare involves taking risks. In some cases, as with the CIA’s covert support to Poland’s Solidarity during the 1980s, codenamed QRHELPFUL, those risks paid off by weakening the Soviet Union and its partners. But in other cases, such as in Iran and Guatemala, the United States made significant mistakes that ran contrary to its democratic principles. Because of these risks, some U.S. officials will strongly resist engaging in offensive activities that attempt to exploit China’s weaknesses and vulnerabilities. While it is important to weigh the pros and cons of specific actions, the United States would never have succeeded in undermining Soviet power and influence without taking risks that exploited its adversary’s vulnerabilities. The same is true for China moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-multilateral-approach&quot;&gt;A MULTILATERAL APPROACH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An effective strategy against Chinese political warfare requires the assistance of U.S. partners. For example, Australia blocked the purchase of Huawei 5G telecommunications gear for its national network and was an outspoken critic of China’s human rights abuses and anti-democratic practices. But the threat from China against U.S. partners is likely to be persistent. As a report by the UK’s Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament concluded, “China’s size, ambition and capability have enabled it to successfully penetrate every sector of the UK’s economy, and — until the Covid-19 pandemic — Chinese money was readily accepted by [His Majesty’s Government] with few questions asked.” In many cases, the United States will need to train, advise, and assist state and non-state actors across the globe to balance against China — and to work by, with, and through its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can build from existing arrangements, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (or Quad, which includes Japan, Australia, India, and the United States); treaty alliances with Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand; defense relationships with Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam, and other countries; and the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) partnership. Another example is the Minerals Security Partnership, which includes Australia, Canada, the European Union, Finland, France, Japan, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. This partnership aims to bolster and safeguard the supply of nickel, cobalt, lithium, copper, and rare-earth metals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Chinese economic coercion, the United States and its partners in the Indo-Pacific should also develop a new strategy of “collective resilience.” Key countries, such as Australia, Japan, the United States, and South Korea, should be prepared to cut off — and threaten to cut off — China’s access to vital goods when Beijing acts against any member. The goal should be to deter Chinese predatory activity and compel Beijing to stop if it does conduct economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more effective U.S. and partner strategy needs to begin with a recognition that competition with China is inescapable. The authoritarianism and illiberalism at the root of China’s political and economic system is antithetical to Western Enlightenment values. Competition is, to a great extent, a struggle over ideologies and systems. Much is at stake, including the shape, make-up, and power of political norms, the international trading system, multilateral security organizations, and international institutions. China is vulnerable to a strategy that exploits the weaknesses of its authoritarian government at home and abroad by encouraging democratic reforms, opening up financial markets, and undermining the state’s control of information. Such a strategy requires playing better defense and offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that cooperation is impossible or even unpalatable. Competition and cooperation are not zero-sum. China will hopefully remain an important trading partner in the future and a critical market for U.S. and multinational companies. China’s economy is growing, its manufacturing sector is the largest in the world by a wide margin, its population of 1.4 billion is an attractive market for U.S. companies, and it boasts 400 million millennials — five times as many as the United States. China and the United States also share common interests in climate change, nonproliferation, global energy markets, counterterrorism, trade, and other areas. Not all competition is bad. Athletes, companies, spelling bee contestants, students, and even universities compete with each other. Healthy competition can benefit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and other democratic countries should ultimately take solace that democracy — with all its flaws and inconsistencies — is still an enviable form of government. As Winston Churchill remarked: “Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or allwise. Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.” Churchill’s words are a helpful reminder that the United States’ democratic principles are its strongest weapons against Chinese political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（1日）踏入審訊第96天。人民力量前主席陳志全今開始作供，就人力曾發文稱各方如望進行真正初選，應定出「共同政治行動綱領」及在議會制衡政府的「一致行動守則」，如能成事人力會樂意參與。陳解釋「共同政治行動綱領」一詞人力很早已使用，指人力以往不參與傳統民主派的選舉協調，甚至與之「對選」，原因就是「我哋根本同佢（民主派）冇共同政治行動綱領」；又指有人以為民主派取得36席「實贏」，但關鍵在於民主派當選後有否一致行動守則，盡責開會投票，惟陳指曾試過早上8時半準時開會，只有他一個面對十幾個建制派，批評過去民主派作為少數派，「竟然出席率係差過建制派」，亦「各自為政」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指他最終參與初選，非因滿意已定出上述綱領和守則，但不參與或會變成選民「不投」的對象。陳又強調，提到「共同政治行動綱領」時絕無綑綁無差別否決預算案之意，指過往任議員均會視乎提出的訴求、預算案內容及民意決定如何投票，「絕無可能係未見到份財政預算案就話或者要求人一齊去做呢樣嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳志全開始作供-稱曾兩任新東立會議員創辦大愛同盟&quot;&gt;陳志全開始作供 稱曾兩任新東立會議員、創辦大愛同盟&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍昨作供完畢，今由同參選新東的人民力量前主席、前立法會議員陳志全作供，陳身穿白裇衫和灰色西褲宣誓，接受大律師馬維騉主問。陳同意，他於香港出生、長大，於香港中文大學畢業後成為電台節目主持，曾與譚得志主持節目《馬路之友》。辯方指他因此節目取名「慢必」，陳則指在此前他與譚已取名「慢必」和「快必」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 人民力量前主席、前立法會議員 陳志全&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳同意，於2012年成為新界東立法會議員，其後出櫃，並加入了政制事務委員會的消除歧視性小眾諮詢小組，解釋是由政制及內地事務局負責，因該局其中一個職能就是促進香港人權狀況，包括性小眾權益，當時該局的副局長亦是該小組成員。陳亦確認是大愛同盟其中一個創辦者，該組織於2013年創立，目的是促進香港性小眾權益和教育，創辦人包括何韻詩、黃耀明、趙式芝及時任立法會議員何秀蘭。陳其後於2016年連任立會議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱有意連任-指做議員初心是推進性傾向歧視條例立法&quot;&gt;陳稱有意連任 指做議員「初心」是推進性傾向歧視條例立法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續問，曾聽過陳志全被讚為最勤力議員，甚至獲時任立法會主席讚賞，問陳認為該說法是否公允，陳說「其實我自己係受之有愧嘅，因為做一份工⋯⋯」，惟法官李運騰打斷，指屬傳聞證供，陳仲衡亦說區諾軒已說過相關證據，為何要證人本人再次確認，辯方續就下一議題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問是否打算參與2020年立法會選舉，陳指他曾任兩屆議員，「我係一直都係諗住再最少做多一屆議員」，解釋政府承諾的性傾向歧視條例立法，「搞咗成十幾年，連一個公眾諮詢都冇」，「所以呢個都係我好主打嘅、或者參選做議員嘅其中一個初心」，「我都係諗住去連任，希望喺呢個重要議題上，喺我能力範圍內幫手有啲推進。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱獲區諾軒告知新東首會議-僅派助理出席因對初選籌備唔係好緊張&quot;&gt;陳稱獲區諾軒告知新東首會議 僅派助理出席因對初選籌備「唔係好緊張」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全續指，在2020年1、2月左右，聽到戴耀廷提議辦初選的消息，解釋他是立法會議員，亦是D100網台主持，會將新聞消息作為節目題材，故特別留意政情專欄、即政客八卦新聞，當時有提及有人構思搞初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳並指，其後從區諾軒正式知道有初選的籌備，解釋九東最先辦協調會議，而時任人力副主席譚得志在九東「做咗好多功夫」，大家也知他有興趣參選九東，故九東第一次會議前，區諾軒曾發 WhatsApp 訊息給陳，指「九龍東嗰班友想開會，想搵快必咁樣」，並指他曾發訊息予譚得志但無回覆，故問陳譚得志有否收到訊息。陳其後問譚，譚稱有收過區的訊息，「之後就佢哋自己聯絡。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 譚得志（左）、陳志全（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，區當時沒有邀請他參與初選，亦沒提過其他區有協調會議，而他是於4月頭由區發訊息告知4月14日有首次新東協調會議。陳指當天是星期二，但他逢周二晚上7時半到8時半要在數碼港「D100」網台做節目。陳續笑說：「不過老實講，就算我得閒呢，我都未必會去嘅，因為我對於初選呢個籌備呢，其實唔係好緊張」，故最後也是派助理代表出席，叫他去「聽吓」，「有咩嘢就返嚟話畀我知啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱九東第二次會議後有傳人力反初選反得最犀利-曾發文澄清&quot;&gt;陳稱九東第二次會議後有傳人力「反初選反得最犀利」 曾發文澄清&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，但此前陳志全得悉譚得志在九東會議的討論內容嗎？陳說「其實呢到到而家我都唔係好搞得清楚，譚得志去過幾多次協調會，甚至佢有冇去過協調會，我問返啲人，個個嘅版本都唔同嘅」，但九東第二次會議曾發生了一些事，被政情專欄報導，陳其後有主動理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示第二次九東協調會議數日後，人民力量於3月22日的 Facebook 帖文〈人民力量贊成有共同政治行動綱領的初選〉。陳解釋第二次九東會議後，《蘋果日報》刊出一篇政壇八卦新聞，提及人民力量在會上「反對初選反對得最犀利」。陳指該次會議最終決定不辦初選，用選前民調的棄選機制，但該報導會令人覺得「係人民力量喺度搞破壞，搞到九東搞唔成初選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳認為是有份開會人士「放料」予記者，想誤導記者或公眾人民力量「唔支持初選，入去開會係搞局」，而因這些政壇八卦多人流傳討論，他為免以訛傳訛和日後可能有人以此消息攻擊人民力量，故與有份開會的人力成員劉嘉鴻指「不如出返篇文去講返事實出嚟」。陳並指以他所知，譚得志當日無去開會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱人力過往不參與協調甚至與民主派對選-甚至被稱民建聯b隊&quot;&gt;陳稱人力過往不參與協調甚至與民主派對選 甚至被稱「民建聯B隊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問「共同政治行動綱領」的意思，陳指「其實呢個詞語呢，人民力量好早期已經用㗎喇」，指人力的成立「都係對傳統民主派嘅不滿，所以先至有呢班人走埋一齊，去成立呢個組織」，過去也「比較少同民主派合作」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，民主派過去每逢有選舉，不論立法會或區議會也會想做協調，而人民力量「早期唔單止冇參與，甚至乎會主動同現有民主派議員係對選嘅，民主派仲會話我哋係『民建聯B隊』」。陳解釋若有民主派和建制派參選，而人力派第三人去選，自然會分薄民主派得票令其落選。陳補充，記得民主黨2012年「仲喺選舉論壇話我係『人民幣力量』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，當時不與民主派協調甚至「對選」，說法就是「我哋根本同佢冇共同政治行動綱領」，例如人力反對「小圈子選舉」，但當時民主黨就支持時任特首曾蔭權的政改方案，增加5席超級區議會。此時法官陳仲衡打斷，指辯方只是要求陳就「共同政治行動綱領」一詞解釋，又指法庭程序並非電台節目，雖然沒有時限，但也應集中在相關事項。馬維騉表示明白，「讓我叫停我當事人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指與民主派根本無共同政治行動綱領&quot;&gt;陳指與民主派根本無共同政治行動綱領&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，因此簡言之，人民力量與民主派並無「共同政治行動綱領」？陳說「係，我簡單用三句講埋佢啦⋯⋯即係當啲民主派攻擊我哋，話我哋又唔協調又唔同佢哋初選、甚至同佢哋對選，我哋嗰陣時嘅答覆就係話，我同你都冇共同行動綱領，咁我會唔會同民建聯工聯會初選吖？」，指這也是答覆民主派和公眾的原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳同意於3月24日的《人民主場》節目，再重申人民力量支持有共同政治行動綱領的初選，解釋因兩日前的回應帖文無人看也無甚回應，記者亦無跟進。陳一度稱：「我哋 expect 咁起碼你《蘋果日報》寫嗰個記者都應該要出返篇文或者打個電話嚟問吓我哋」，但終卻「唔負責任，由佢自己發酵」。陳慶偉着陳仔細聆聽律師問題，盡可能用簡單的語言直接作答，又指用中文作供其中一個好處就是有更多時間可以思考。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指期許民主派有一致行動守則積極參與議會-惟批民主派出席率差過建制派&quot;&gt;陳指期許民主派有一致行動守則、積極參與議會 惟批民主派出席率差過建制派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後再問及「共同政治行動綱領」的意思，陳補充上述帖文提到「人民力量重申，如各方希望進行真正初選，應努力思考並定出共同政治綱領及在議會制衡政府的一致行動守則」，當中「一致行動守則」是指做議員「一啲好基本嘅紀律操守」，因「有啲人以為你攞到嗰個議席，譬如36席，咁你就實贏喇咁樣」，但陳認為這只是停留在理論層面，關鍵在於這班議員「有冇一致嘅行動守則」。陳又舉例有證人指不用36席，其實取得30、33席也足以予建制派或政府很大壓力，翻查資料，此說法來自何桂藍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，「呢度唔係講話要贊成或者否決某一條特別嘅法例或者撥款」，而是「究竟嗰個議員係咪盡責，佢係咪去開會、係咪會坐足個會、係咪投票會喺度、係咪會加入盡量多嘅委員會，呢個就係我一向所謂對民主派嘅一個期許」。陳續指：「我舉一個好簡單嘅例子，我做咗八年議員，當你試過朝早8點半開會返到去會議室嘅時候，得你一個民主派係準時，面對住十幾個建制派嘅時候⋯⋯建制派係多數派，蔣麗芸一個都入十幾個事務委員會，民主派嘅議員竟然可以入得嗰三四個委員會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指有幾多議席是一回事是否積極開會和有紀律是另一回事&quot;&gt;陳指有幾多議席是一回事、是否積極開會和有紀律是另一回事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，立法會出席率是「最寬鬆」，三日的會議「你一坐落去點一個名就係出席咗」，但「民主派作為少數派，竟然出席率係差過建制派，最尾嗰十個出席率最低，有七個係民主派議員」，「所以你有幾多席係一回事，你係咪積極去開會、係咪有紀律係另一回事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，「投票係隨時會投㗎」，當一個人發言完畢、無第二個人起身發言就會投票，「如果你唔喺立法會或者你出咗去做第二啲嘢嘅時候，就算你係多個人或者少個人，你都係投唔到嗰一票」。陳仲衡問，故「行動守則」只是指出席率？陳指是「對議會嘅積極參與程度，出席率只不過係其中一個最低嘅反映」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，民主派過去各自為政，「我連要求四大版塊（即民主黨、公民黨、專業議政及議會陣線），每個版塊有一個人準時開會得唔得呀，都做唔到，咁講乜嘢抗爭」，又指有多少議席「係一個數」，「但係你係咪去每一日要同政府個角力，畀到壓力政府慢慢逐步逐步增加，都要靠你議會嘅參與，係咪嗰個積極先至能夠做到㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉問，故陳提及的責任、出席率等就是「共同政治行動綱領」？陳指那些是「一致行動守則」，亦指當然要建基於此守則，所謂共同政治綱領才會有意思。陳仲衡問，但初選最後有否就出席率達成協議？陳指沒有，指他根本無出席過協調會議，亦無在會上提出其要求，而他對民主派「比較勤力積極參與發言、提修正案、準時投票、唔好甩咁多轆」的要求，是一直以來都有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指對初選有好大期望-不代表不符期望就不參加-否則變成不投的對象&quot;&gt;陳指對初選有好大期望 不代表不符期望就不參加 否則變成「不投」的對象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉打斷陳發言，笑言明白他對政府、民主派和建制派有很多不滿，但認為陳最終要說的是初選要先定出共同政治行動綱領和一致行動守則，否則就沒有意義，指他明白這點。李運騰續問，帖文提到「如果能夠成事，人民力量非常樂意參與一個完全以陣營為先、派別為後作基調的初選基制」，而陳最終有參與初選，即是說他當時認為初選已做到該兩點，即有「共同政治行動綱領」和「一致行動守則」？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳答「並唔係」，並指「我對初選有一個好大嘅期望，但係唔代表佢符合唔到我期望，我就唔參加，有時好多嘢現實唔係話要符合到期望我先至去參與」，陳續舉例「你睇到我哋喺會（第二次九東協調會）裡面理性討論講利弊，話其實民調棄選（機制）已經OK達到個效果，已經畀人攻擊，如果我話『唉你冇共同綱領冇行動守則』就唔參加，咁我咪變咗不投（呼籲不要投票）嘅對象囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱絕不無差別否決預算案亦不會如此要求人-指過往均以3原則考慮投票&quot;&gt;陳稱絕不無差別否決預算案亦不會如此要求人 指過往均以3原則考慮投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續問，陳志全使用「共同政治行動綱領」等字眼時，是綑綁所有立法會議員不論預算案內容也無差別否決預算案嗎？陳以響亮聲線回答：「絕無此意，我自己唔會咁做，亦都唔會咁要求人」，並解釋過去任議員8年都是看到預算案後，再以3個原則判斷是支持還是反對，包括提出的訴求，如過去人力與社民連提出「全民退休保障」、人力提出「全民直接回水」；其次是要看到預算案條目內容再去研究；第三是看當時民意，「所以絕無可能係未見到份財政預算案就話或者要求人去一齊做呢樣嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yAfprsQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（1日）踏入審訊第96天。陳志全繼續作供，確認無出席新東協調會議，並認為「墨落無悔」聲明「冇乜問題」遂簽署，理解聲明無綑綁否決預算案，亦指否決財案是議員其中一項權力，當然可用來要求政府回應五大訴求。陳亦理解協調會議共識不涉否決財案，並認為「會」或「積極」否決分別不大，舉例政府無論說「會」或「會積極」考慮，「其實都係唔會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就宣傳片段提到如有35+便可令特首下台等，陳解釋片段重點是「35-」而非「35+」，坦言認為能取35席機會好微，若不停講就如予選民「empty promise（空頭支票）」；又指如有「35+」其實「大晒」、「使唔使我做都冇所謂」，但反而「35-」就需更多「有紀律」和「實幹型」的議員，故他在片中是「sell」業績。陳又指，縱35+機會微仍提可否決預算案等，是因當時社會瀰漫很大無力感，望對峙此無力感，鼓勵選民投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳確認無出席新東協調會議-由助理蘇浩出席匯報情況&quot;&gt;陳確認無出席新東協調會議 由助理蘇浩出席匯報情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全繼續作供，同意兩次新東會議均無親身出席，並派助理蘇浩出席。辯方大律師馬維騉展示人民力量執委會2020年5月13日的會議紀錄，出席者包括陳志全、譚得志和蘇浩，當中提到「有關各區的初選機制，新東原本用最嚴謹的方式，報名前已選定名單，但由於其他區用寬鬆的初選機制，新界東的初選機制可能有改變，包括由『會運用否決財政預算案』轉為『積極運用否決財政預算案』」。陳指是由蘇浩匯報兩次新東會議情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;人民力量會議紀錄稱新東最嚴謹其他區較寛鬆&quot;&gt;人民力量會議紀錄稱新東最嚴謹、其他區較寛鬆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前有證供指新東討論目標議席是「6」或「6+1」，被問如何理解「新東原本用最嚴謹的方式，報名前已選定名單」，陳指「因為新東其實喺9席裡面攞到6席已經係奇蹟嚟㗎喇」，故認為新東目標議席應是6席就「冇乜好拗嘅」，而其他區或有不同處理方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，所以對陳來說，「6+1」是幻想？陳志全提高了聲線：「真係簡直係痴線呀！因為6（席）已經係奇蹟嚟㗎喇，新界西呢係4（席）呀，建制派5（席）呀」，陳續加快語速：「即係我當時諗喂你唔好以為你識協調你識棄保，人哋建制派都識協調，人哋嗰個機器仲精密過你、個棄保仲精密過你，你點可能對6以外有任何痴心妄想，6都已經係唔穩陣㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問何謂「棄保」，是指棄選替補？陳指不是，解釋是當建制派發現取不到一定數量議席，就會放棄最後一個名單，「譬如佢琴日打嚟話要投鄧家彪，佢知道鄧家彪贏唔到喇，佢聽日就打嚟叫你唔好投鄧家彪，投容海恩啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳民主派新東取6席為奇蹟難保持其他區亦難複製&quot;&gt;陳：民主派新東取6席為「奇蹟」難保持、其他區亦難複製&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指對該句仍不太明白，陳同意，指「其實我睇返都係有啲唔係好明嘅，啲文字唔係寫得好清楚」，指新東最「嚴謹」可能指目標為6席並派6隊出選，而其他區較「寬鬆」可能指目標議席3席，但初選可選5隊。陳並指就「嚴謹」與「寬鬆」的形容，與該段後半談及「會運用」和「積極運用」權力否決預算案無關，屬「兩件事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續同意，6席是「好難得先能夠得到嘅結果」，並確認2016至2020年新東民主派取得6席。李運騰指他不明白，即當時奇蹟已發生？陳用力點頭：「係。」陳慶偉說，故陳的意思是泛民要保持6席是非常困難？陳說：「保持又難，其他區想複製都好難。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱認為會或積極差別不大-以政府為例指都係唔會&quot;&gt;陳稱認為「會」或「積極」差別不大 以政府為例指「都係唔會」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問到紀錄上提到新東「會運用（權力）否決財政預算案」或轉為「積極運用」，陳指蘇浩匯報時稱會上有此討論，但無說「一定要去咁樣做嘅」，因陳也無授權過蘇在會上「應承任何嘢」。陳又指不太關注該討論，因認為兩者分別「唔係好大」，直至審訊才知當時會上原來有「所謂嘅劇烈嘅爭拗」，有人會理解「會積極運用」意思是「冇咁肯定」，「呢個係我喺法庭聽到先至諗呢樣嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又表示，庭上聽到「加咗個『積極』落去就好似冇咁肯定、程度會低咗啲」，但以他的認知，加「積極」反而表示「更加着緊去做呢件事」，舉例以往政府講「會積極考慮」時就像「行多咗一步仔咁」。不過陳補充以他的經驗，「無論政府話『會』、『會積極』或者『會考慮』呢，其實都係唔會嘅」，如反性傾向歧視條例立法。陳慶偉指這取決於情況，如政府說會為公務員加薪，相信公務員不會認為政府不會加他們薪，但表示理解陳的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰關注，會議紀錄意思是否指原本已決定「會運用」，之後可能改為「會積極運用」，陳指當時沒有考慮這部分，因不認為是初選機制問題，他只關注目標議席是否由6席變為6+1。陳志全亦不同意陳仲衡指這是關於「共同政治行動綱領」，因不是約束大家當選之後如何投票；並同意李運騰指文件有含糊之處，但他並無尋求澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，記得與會者都應無出席九東第三次協調會議，而人民力量亦沒有派人去新界西參選和出席新西協調會議，但事後梁家聲「就話自己八卦去咗睇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指從何桂藍fb看到墨落聲明冇咩問題遂與譚得志簽署&quot;&gt;陳指從何桂藍FB看到「墨落」聲明、「冇咩問題」遂與譚得志簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落無悔」聲明，馬維騉問陳志全有否簽署，陳大聲肯定答：「有」，解釋6月10日晚「碌 Facebook」時看到何桂藍發布的「墨落」聲明，他看到兩點聲明後覺得「冇咩特別」、「冇咩大嘅問題」，遂問譚得志是否簽署，譚說簽，他遂將聲明複製至其 Facebook 發布，譚並稱找人民力量義工幫手製圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬問及 Facebook 的操作，陳續解釋他們這些「政治人」多數有兩個 Facebook 專頁，一是個人 Facebook，一是 Facebook 專頁，個人帳戶會加朋友，但專頁帳戶是「follow 就睇到」。陳慶偉一度問：「By『專頁』，you mean professional（專業）？」有旁聽人士發笑，陳仲衡再問陳志全是否指「專業」，陳志全說：「唔係，一頁書一頁書嗰個『頁』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指否決是議員權力-當然可運用叫政府回應五大訴求&quot;&gt;陳指否決是議員權力 當然可運用叫政府回應五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就聲明的「我認同『五大訴求，缺一不可』」，陳指相信當時絕大部分民主派支持者或政治人物都認同五大訴求；至於「我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，陳指覺得大部分支持者都會認同，「當我係議員嘅時候，我當然要盡我嘅努力去令政府去回應五大訴求啦」，而由於否決財案是立法會議員其中一項權力，「咁當然我哋可以去運用呢個權力，去叫政府回應五大訴求啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於聲明第二點「我認同若支持度跌出預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」，陳指認為這點反而更加重要，因當時已有人質疑民主派「乜嘢都冇承諾過」，可能「初選輸咗但係都唔認數繼續參選」，惟陳認為此質疑對整個民主派並非一件好或健康的事，會導致選民猶豫「係咪真係出嚟投票」，而有人做此聯署，正可回應此問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳認為墨落無綑綁議員一致否決財案35目標是努力爭取回應五大訴求&quot;&gt;陳認為「墨落」無綑綁議員一致否決財案、35+目標是努力爭取回應五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於聲明提到「已取得共識的共同綱領」，陳指當時兩次協調會議均無出席，是按有出席的助理蘇浩匯報情況去理解，共識即是辦初選、議席數目、替補機制和辦論壇。馬維騉問有否綑綁議員一致否決預算案，陳指由於他被告知的兩次新東會議內並無這回事，故對該段文字亦無此理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於提名表格提到「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」，陳指對該點理解同樣建基其助理的匯報，即會辦公民投票、新界東目標議席是6席、替補機制用靈童制、及辦論壇，至於「目標」就是「我哋如果當選咗議員，就要努力爭取要政府回應五大訴求囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳認35機會微不停講為empty-promise-競選重點在35-非35&quot;&gt;陳認「35+」機會微、不停講為empty promise 競選重點在「35-」非「35+」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後播放人民力量的初選競選影片〈快慢對對話〉，片中陳志全與譚得志談及35+，陳提及：「35+當然係好啦，主席又係我哋，咩惡法都可以反對反對反對，大白象工程又反對反對反對，跟住反對埋財政預算案、解散立法會、特首都要下台」，馬維騉問陳為何這樣說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指影片是競選宣傳短片，片中譚得志提到大家對「35+」有期望，問陳「咁35-又點呢？」，他才有上述回答。陳並指雖然初選主軸是「35+」，但影片宗旨並不是想講「35+」，而是講「35-」，因他對「35+」能否實現有很大懷疑，「甚至坦白講我覺得能夠攞到35席嘅機會係好微」，故無論是宣傳街站或是拍短片，人力雖會提及「35+」，但重點不在「35+」，而是「35-」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳競選sell業績-因35-需實幹型議員&quot;&gt;陳：競選「sell業績」 因「35-」需實幹型議員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指將重點放在「35-」有兩個原因，首先他認為「35+」的可能性不算大，「你如果不停去講、或者講得太勁嘅嘅時候，你好似畀緊一個 empty promise（空頭支票）、一個唔能夠落實嘅願景俾啲選民。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其次他指很多人在初選「sell 嗰個願景，未來如果可以有35+可以點點點」，「但我 sell 嘅呢，係業績」，故影片主要講述自己過去做過什麼，「因為其實35+呢你大晒、你做乜都得，你開會又得唔開會又得，你話一聲到時否決咩，就好似好勁咁，所以如果35+呢，其實駛唔駛我做都冇所謂，你做、你做、佢做都得，最後就係投嗰一票」，陳邊說邊指向法官、律師度和被告席方向，續說：「反而35-呢，就需要更多有紀律同埋實幹型嘅議員。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳提35可否決財案乃鼓勵選民投票-對峙無力感&quot;&gt;陳：提35+可否決財案乃鼓勵選民投票 對峙無力感&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，雖認為35+可能性很微，但在宣傳片和街站仍提及，其中一個作用是要「打」這個主題出來，讓選民知道「如果你得到呢樣野，有乜嘢嘅力量可以做到」。陳續指2019至2020年，社會瀰漫一股很大的無力感，「好似做乜嘢都冇用」，「當我哋想鼓勵選民出嚟投票嘅時候，就要對峙佢呢一種無力感」，告訴選民如果有「35+」，「我哋有ABCD咁樣嘅選擇、或者有啲咁樣嘅能力」，希望選民會覺得「議會有用、投票有用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問到，那為何陳要提及否決財政預算案，解散立會及使特首下台。陳志全解釋這是向選民列舉「35+」可以做到的事情，「成個進展解釋一次畀大家去知道」，目的是鼓勵選民出來投票，「但係唔係話我會咁做」，整條片重心亦不在此。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vkfWnUg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（1日）踏入審訊第96天。陳志全繼續作供，就立法會選舉延期後，議員獲延任一年但他選擇不留任，陳解釋因只獲選民授權任4年議員，亦對民主派失望。陳指，當時去留爭議只從理論上指留任「有點好」，卻無民主派議員願出來承認「我哋以前做得唔夠好」，並承諾留任後會盡最大努力做好議員職責，陳自言當時「我真係有好大嘅無力感同埋無心戀戰」，故選擇不留任。陳又一度指「我嘅惡夢係，你哋話留任，我陪你留」，但到了早上8點半鐘開會，又「得我一個對住十幾個建制派」，陳指如萬一他也遲到，「真係冇經審議就可以過好多議案嘅撥款。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就何桂藍早前稱曾邀請陳志全出席抗爭派記者會但「食檸檬」，陳解釋當時理解是抗爭派「祝捷會」，因不覺與他們同一派系，故無想過出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指現身何桂藍街站-陳解釋與黃耀明何韻詩打招呼&quot;&gt;官指現身何桂藍街站 陳解釋與黃耀明何韻詩打招呼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全繼續作供，就何桂藍上周播放初選投票首日於大圍街站的片段，法官陳慶偉一度指看到陳志全。陳今解釋，當日他也在大圍火車站另一邊開街站籲市民投票，看到該處有很多記者，得悉是何桂藍見記者，而「大愛同盟」的共同創辦人黃耀明和何韻詩亦在場。陳指當時心想，「佢哋見緊記者我就唔好過去騷擾佢哋，費事啲人話我係攝石人」，而後來以為已見完記者就走過去與二人打招呼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱認為抗爭派記者會是祝捷會-不認為屬同派系故無想過去&quot;&gt;陳稱認為抗爭派記者會是祝捷會 不認為屬同派系故無想過去&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於7月15日抗爭派記者會，何桂藍早前稱曾邀陳志全出席但「食檸檬」，陳今指何提及「我請佢食檸檬嗰時呢，其實我係印象好模糊，唔係好記得呢一幕」。陳續說「我就唔記得何桂藍有冇叫過我喇」，但記得朱凱廸曾問他是否出席該記者會，他當時亦拒絕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sQgtSVl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年7月15日 抗爭派記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡追問，陳是沒有空抑或不想去？陳說按其認知，「嗰個係抗爭派嘅祝捷會嚟嘅，因為佢哋喺初選度佢哋係覺得自己大勝啦」，有份出席的余慧明掩嘴發笑。陳續說：「咁我唔覺得我同佢哋係同一個派系，所以佢哋一個祝捷會，我就冇諗過會去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;人大宣布議員延任一年-陳不主張留任因對民主派議員失望&quot;&gt;人大宣布議員延任一年 陳：不主張留任因對民主派議員失望&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續確認，他7月27日收到選舉主任提問，翌日回覆後，政府便於7月31日宣布選舉延期，直至當時選舉主任仍未就其提名是否有效作出裁決。其後人大常委會於8月11日宣布現任立法會議員延任一年，但陳於同年9月28日通知立法會秘書處，9月30日任期屆滿之後不會延任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋拒絕延任有兩個原因，其一是他覺得他參加2016年立法會選舉時，選民只授權他做一屆四年任期，如他在9月30日之後的時間延任「我係冇得到選民嘅授權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二個原因則與他今早提及對民主派的失望有關，陳指當時社會就議員應否留任有很多爭論，當中提到去或留的好處，主張留任的人指「如果立法會冇晒民主派，咁政府咪過乜嘢都得囉」，所以認為留任有價值，然而陳自言「我係極少數話我唔係『主留派』，我係傾向唔留任嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指當時無很廣泛地與人說，只做了一兩個訪問表示：「你哋話留低有價值嘅議員，會唔會去承諾，喺延任嘅時候你會盡你最大嘅努力去做好議員嘅職責呢？」，即他今早提及「要勤力開會、準時、積極發言」。陳續指如果當時主張留任的議員「肯出嚟講，我哋以前做得唔夠好」，並願承諾在留任的日子，會準時開會、盡能力加入所有委員會、積極發言質詢及「投票唔好甩轆」，「可能我都會再考慮留唔留。但傾咗一大餐冇人講呢一啲問題，淨係講理論上留任有點好有點好」，陳苦笑搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳無人承諾準時開會等基本嘢-有很大無力感無心戀戰&quot;&gt;陳：無人承諾準時開會等「基本嘢」 有很大無力感、無心戀戰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續說：「我嘅惡夢係，你哋話留任，我陪你留，跟住朝早8點半鐘開會，得我一個對住十幾個建制派。如果萬一我都遲到嘅話，真係冇經審議就可以過好多議案嘅撥款」，陳再說：「因為冇人可以應承到我呢啲咁基本嘅野，喺嗰個時刻，我真係有好大嘅無力感同埋無心戀戰，你可以話。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指反對派即使在議會是少數，其功能就如一塊石頭，「唔多唔少你都可以阻到一啲唔得市民支持嘅法例或者撥款嘅通過」，也可透過質詢和辯論，令更多市民知道內情。此時法官李運騰打斷，認為陳已回答了問題，不需要陳的詳細回答，馬維騉亦指明白無需要。陳志全終指：「我簡單一句總結，就係冇人畀到承諾話留任嘅時候會盡力去開會，所以我選擇唔留任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳重申不會在未見法案或撥款前否決&quot;&gt;陳重申不會在未見法案或撥款前否決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉最後問陳，直至他2020年被捕，有否講過、或意圖予人印象他會無差別否決財政預算案，陳表示沒有。馬再問陳會否無差別否決預算案，陳稱：「我唔會喺未見到個法案或者撥款之前就話我會否決佢。」陳亦指，沒有人在任何階段要求他否決財案或同意他們如此做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續指，基本上已問完打算問的問題，望保留主問的權利直至明早，才正式完結主問。鄒家成難以置信地笑望林卓廷，何桂藍亦發笑。案件明早續審。另歌手黃耀明下午亦有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OgRoqn7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic today is playing an increasingly prevalent role in geopolitical competition between Russia, China and the West. This is particularly evident in two maritime sub-regions: the Barents Sea (North Atlantic) and the Bering Sea (North Pacific). In addition to strategic concerns associated with geopolitical competition, these Arctic maritime domains play host to a range of issues around access to maritime resources, most notably fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues stand to evolve significantly as climate change contributes to warming oceanic temperatures, shifting fish distributions and changing demand for fisheries products. In the Arctic, surface air temperatures are rising 2–4 times faster than the global average, with warming waters causing some of the most significant shifts in fish stocks globally, and marine catch potential in the Arctic increasing as the anticipated ranges of some species extend poleward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is challenging established management regimes for transboundary resources, impacting both sustainable resource management at sea and wider security relations in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-north-atlantic-and-barents-sea&quot;&gt;The North Atlantic and Barents Sea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located north of the Norwegian and Russian mainland and adjacent to the Arctic Ocean itself, the Barents Sea is the breeding ground of the largest cod stock in the world – a critical resource for citizens of both countries. Since the 1970s, cooperation between Norway and Russia on fisheries in the Barents Sea has developed pragmatically. Often hailed as a prime example of successful co-management of shared fish stocks, this regime has withstood both the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, tensions are mounting along two axes. First, there are fears that Russia could be utilising maritime space in the Barents Sea to challenge NATO – fears rooted in an assumption that any deliberate Russian action is likely to be hybrid in form, remaining below the threshold of direct warfare or direct conflict. Recent attention has focused on the role of Russian fishing vessels in the Barents Sea, with claims from the Norwegian naval academy that between 50 and 100 of those operating in Norwegian waters could be linked to intelligence gathering activities and pose a potential security threat. In parallel, there are mounting concerns over the vulnerability of critical infrastructure such as subsea cables (particularly in the context of climate change) and the way in which fishing vessels could be used in possible disruptive action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If fisheries cooperation between Norway and Russia were to break down and Norway were to deny Russian fishers access to its waters, the potential for unintentional escalation could increase&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, fears are rising around unintentional escalation in the maritime domain. The relatively high level of military exercise activity in the North Atlantic means that the danger of accidents involving fishers, both legitimate and illegal, is real. Another potential source of unintentional escalation could stem from the exercise of Norwegian maritime police authority towards Russian citizens. The Norwegian coast guard inspects and occasionally fines Russian fishers in the Norwegian exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or the Fish Protection Zone around Svalbard, with the potential for unintentional escalation should a case take on a state-state dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The linkages between fisheries and security concerns here are thus apparent. These issues are likely to worsen as Arctic waters continue to warm. In this context, if fisheries cooperation between Norway and Russia were to break down and Norway were to deny Russian fishers access to its waters, the potential for unintentional escalation in the course of interaction between the coast guard and Russian fishing vessels could increase. Svalbard’s waters beyond 12 nautical miles are a particularly sensitive matter: Russia does not recognise Norway’s jurisdiction to inspect and arrest vessels in this area. By claiming that these are international waters, Russia can also claim that an inspection and potential subsequent arrest exceeds Norway’s authority in the area, and in turn respond with a threat to use military force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-north-pacific-and-bering-sea&quot;&gt;The North Pacific and Bering Sea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bering Sea comprises the maritime area south of the Bering Strait, where the US and Russia share a maritime border. It is home to a range of marine species of significant economic value, many of which are vulnerable to climate change. US-Russian relations in the Bering Sea, however, have been difficult both historically and in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, the expansion of overfishing in the area prompted negotiations between the former USSR and the US on both fisheries relations and maritime boundaries. Constituting the most lucrative fisheries in North America, the pollock stock subsequently collapsed in the early 1990s after a decade of overfishing in the “donut hole”, a marine area not covered by an EEZ. In 2013, the two countries issued a joint statement on strengthening US-Russian cooperation in the Bering Sea. However, in recent years, tensions have become more acute with Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and subsequent invasion of Ukraine in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although both countries have continued operating emergency services in the Bering Strait, and emergency cooperation here has continued, an increased Russian military presence and shifting stocks due to climate change have worried some US fishers. Further, Alaska’s lucrative snow crab harvest was cancelled this year for the first time ever due to stock collapse, which scientists warn will become increasingly common with climate change. As many species seek cooler, deeper waters, they are likely to migrate beyond historical boundaries, with Russia already exploiting new fishing locations within its EEZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Challenges emerge in the Arctic context around the unclear role of Russian fishing and research vessels, and the inherent difficulties of monitoring and control at sea&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also increasingly expressed an interest in the Arctic – despite not sharing a border with the region – which has manifested itself through bilateral cooperation with Russia. In September 2022, reports that the US Coast Guard had spotted Chinese and Russian naval vessels engaged in some form of military operations off the coast of the Alaskan Aleutian islands offered another signal of increased Sino-Russian Arctic cooperation, in the aftermath of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In April 2023, a Memorandum of Understanding between the Chinese and Russian coast guards was signed in the Arctic town of Murmansk. Increased cooperation between the two countries on Arctic and ocean affairs, including fisheries, is likely to play out in the Bering Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shifting-strategic-relationships&quot;&gt;Shifting Strategic Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, it is highly likely that strategic Arctic fisheries relations will become more sensitive for two reasons. First, key species – depending on their mobility and habitat connection – are expected to respond to climate change by shifting their distributions poleward to cooler waters. Indeed, in the Arctic, warming waters are causing some of the most significant shifts in fish stocks globally, with this and declining sea-ice coverage affecting fisheries and fishing patterns in key locations. Second, the Barents Sea and Bering Sea will increasingly play a role in strategic posturing, with NATO countries, Russia and even China showcasing their Arctic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, fisheries disputes in the region are increasingly becoming entangled in wider domestic and international politics, with an impact on dynamics in the maritime domain. Rather than being a simple matter of defining rights and ownership, when a maritime dispute reaches the political agenda in this way, domestic actors may also seek to benefit by infusing it with symbolic dimensions, such as “national pride” or “being cheated out of what is ours”. Such politicisation has become still more relevant after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges emerge in the Arctic context around the unclear role of Russian fishing and research vessels, and the inherent difficulties of monitoring and control at sea. Indeed, the conflict potential emanating from small-scale incidents related to both legitimate and illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fisheries in the Barents Sea is greater now than it has been at any time since the end of the Cold War. Meanwhile, in the Bering Sea, increased Russian military presence, as well as military cooperation between Russia and China, will increasingly have an impact on the politicisation of fishing activities and could muster a response from the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Arctic waters continue to warm, and as climate change catalyses a range of disruptive environmental shifts in the region, it will become increasingly critical to manage these relationships sensitively to ensure sustainable resource management, including the prevention of IUU fishing. This must be done in an environment in which the traditional separation between fisheries management and the high politics of security affairs, sanctions and military signalling is eroding. In this context, the security concerns and escalatory effects inherent in fisheries relations across a warming Arctic should prompt caution, calling for careful monitoring and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sm1Zq9s.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing drains billions of dollars in the form of illicit financial flows from countries around the world. Many of these countries are among the most impacted by climate change, with many also facing debt crises and struggling to provide basic services and social protections in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Globally, it has been estimated that IUU fishing generates $50 billion in estimated annual losses, making it the third most lucrative natural resource crime after timber and mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IUU fishing is also estimated to account for up to a fifth of the global seafood catch, playing a key role in the depletion of global fish stocks. Combined with the negative impacts that climate change is having on aquatic species themselves – with global fish biomass predicted to decline by 5% for every 1 degree of global warming – the prospects are bleak if we fail to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation predicts that the maximum catch within the world’s exclusive economic zones will decrease between 2.8% and 12.1% by 2050. This situation is putting at risk millions of people’s livelihoods, especially in poor coastal communities which are the most food insecure and dependent on artisanal fishing for protein. Notably, the effects of IUU fishing and associated illicit financial flows are felt particularly across the Global South, which also covers regions that are the most affected by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-stakes-are-too-high&quot;&gt;The Stakes are too High&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent report found that nearly half of identified commercial vessels involved in IUU fishing operate in Africa, leading to economic losses in the form of illicit financial flows of up to $11.49 billion every year. Madagascar, for example, loses an estimated $80 million every year – substantial losses in a country that suffers from chronic food security issues, among other social and economic challenges. Further afield, in Argentina, losses are estimated at around $2 billion per year; in Indonesia they are estimated at $4 billion – equivalent to the country’s annual net rubber exports. Yet, to date, the global response has been inconsistent with the gravity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among numerous bodies, the High-Level Panel for the Sustainable Ocean Economy (The Ocean Panel) has identified ownership and financial secrecy as a key driver of IUU fishing, allowing the individuals responsible to evade detection. Indeed, a range of organisations have documented the use by international fishing operations of complex company and ownership structures, both to cover up illegal operations and to conceal ultimate beneficial ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the Ocean Panel identified ownership transparency as a key part of the solution for ending IUU fishing in Africa and globally. Yet, it has found that beneficial ownership information is “rarely, if ever, collected during the licensing or vessel registration process”. Meanwhile, limited progress has been made to date on other steps to strengthen beneficial ownership transparency in order to better tackle illicit financial flows stemming from IUU fishing. Despite the direct impact IUU fishing has on global fisheries resources and associated livelihoods, IUU fishing remains largely missing from wider debates around extractive industry transparency or the design of country-based public beneficial ownership registries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The effects of IUU fishing and associated illicit financial flows are felt particularly across the Global South, which also covers regions that are the most affected by climate change&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative was launched in 2002 to facilitate the voluntary disclosure by governments and firms of the beneficial owners of extractive companies. Sadly, the initiative only targets oil, gas and mineral resources, with IUU fishing having been ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Fisheries Transparency Initiative (FiTI) highlights efforts to increase transparency around beneficial ownership, covering the importance of beneficial ownership in its Standard, which defines the information national authorities should publish online about their fisheries sectors. A number of states have signed on to the FiTI Standard. As the first country to report on its commitments, in 2020 the Seychelles passed legislation (the Beneficial Ownership Act 2020) requiring the maintenance of up-to-date registers of beneficial owners, with a central register of beneficial owners in place by 2021. Yet initiatives such as FiTI face a range of issues, not least uptake by a limited number of countries to date and the fact that it only asks countries to report on their progress in implementing public beneficial ownership registries, rather than making it a requirement of adopting the Standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – the global financial crime watchdog – has also been slow. In 2020, FATF highlighted the ways in which widespread use of shell and front companies enables the import and export of endangered wildlife products. A year later, FATF expanded its focus from illegal wildlife trade (IWT) to money laundering risks linked to illegal logging, illegal mining and waste trafficking. But disappointingly, FATF has continued to ignore IUU fishing to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of attention paid by FATF to this issue, in 2022, the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) included a chapter in its typologies report on the illicit finance dimension of IUU fishing, providing case studies and analysis that underline the industrialised nature of the issue. Other FATF-style regional bodies, however, have yet to turn their focus to IUU fishing. They have failed to follow the APG’s example despite the clear demonstration that there is no need to wait for FATF itself – particularly when the impacts of an issue such as IUU fishing are of particular concern to members (often across the Global South).This lack of widespread action comes despite the fact that the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reference natural resource crimes including fisheries crime and tax abuse in the fishing industry as contributing factors to illicit financial flows, as included in SDG target 16.4.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouragingly, the G7 Climate and Environment Ministers’ Communiqué released in May 2021 welcomed “discussions by Finance Ministers on strengthening beneficial ownership transparency to better tackle the illicit financial flows stemming from IWT and other illicit threats to nature”. Yet, again, IUU fishing was not named specifically. This is despite the fact that G7 countries account for the majority of the global seafood market, with this omission reflecting the limited political will to tackle this crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, broader trends in relation to progress on transparency of beneficial ownership could have negative implications for the fisheries sector. Notably, in November 2022, the EU Court of Justice approved a ruling that stands to stall progress by invalidating provisions of the EU’s Anti-Money Laundering Directive that allowed public access to registries detailing beneficial owners. Although it has a much wider scope than beneficial ownership in the fisheries sector, this ruling is likely to undermine progress in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financial-transparency-must-be-prioritised&quot;&gt;Financial Transparency Must be Prioritised&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With climate change heightening geopolitical tensions around fisheries in certain regions and driving changes in patterns of convergence between IUU fishing and other crimes, this failure to act on the opacity and financial secrecy enabling IUU fishing must be addressed. This is particularly urgent given that IUU fishing relies heavily on the formal financial system, making it highly susceptible to concerted action by the anti-financial crime community. Given what is at stake and the need for effective deterrents, financial transparency should now be placed at the heart of efforts to tackle IUU fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FATF must pay the same level of attention to IUU fishing as it has to other natural resource crimes, compelling countries to improve their responses&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of cases show the potential results such prioritisation could yield. In October 2022, a report by the Financial Transparency Coalition found that the top 10 companies involved in IUU fishing for which there is beneficial ownership accounted for nearly one quarter of all reported vessels accused of IUU fishing. The Chinese-owned Pingtan Marine Enterprise Ltd was named as the main culprit. Using the available beneficial ownership data, the company – together with its beneficial owners – was sanctioned by the US government in December 2022 and delisted from the NASDAQ stock exchange. To deter IUU activity we need more action like this, but to enable it, key changes in terms of transparency of beneficial ownership must be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, public beneficial ownership registries must be instituted, whereby the fisheries sector is treated as a high-risk industry, with full disclosure of beneficial owners required when registering vessels. Meanwhile, FATF must pay the same level of attention to IUU fishing as it has to other natural resource crimes, compelling countries to improve their responses. In 2020, for example, FATF sought to galvanise action on IWT by recommending that countries assess their exposure to IWT-linked illicit finance; ensure legal powers exist to bring financial charges in relation to IWT offending; and undertake greater numbers of parallel financial investigations in IWT cases. The same galvanising action should be taken in relation to IUU fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have maximum impact, these measures must be accompanied by other transparency initiatives, with governments publishing up-to-date lists of IUU vessels and making fisheries agreements public. Together, these measures – which are not complex or overly costly to implement – will allow action to be taken against the hidden operators behind IUU activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the multifaceted global threat posed by IUU fishing set to evolve significantly in a warming world, the risk of failing to enact these changes is too great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/05YdEY4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of criminal activity in the fisheries sector has long been a matter of international concern. Today, with the Food and Agriculture Organization reporting record highs in global fisheries and aquaculture production, these concerns have grown ever-more pressing. Indeed, with international trade in fisheries and aquaculture products generating $151 billion in 2020, the scale of today’s global fisheries sector presents a range of critical vulnerabilities. Exploiting these are an array of actors, many potentially engaged in overlapping patterns of crime “convergence” in what has been described as a “perfect storm of illegal activities in the fishing sector”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of the complexity of these issues remains partial. Many relevant activities occur at sea, far from the eyes of those looking to expose them – and across supply chains spanning multiple jurisdictions. Even less well understood is how climate change is set to impact this “perfect storm”, with little research to date on the implications for existing patterns of crime convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it is increasingly clear that criminality in the fisheries sector stands to evolve in a range of ways as the world warms. A number of these potential impacts were highlighted among the top 20 themes emerging from a recent RUSI horizon scan of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing trends in a warming world. These are collated for the first time and drawn out in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;climate-change-and-the-blue-shadow-economy&quot;&gt;Climate Change and the Blue Shadow Economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criminal activity in the fisheries sector is categorised by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime across three broad areas. These include: crimes committed in the course of fishing operations (as a key component of IUU fishing); crimes associated with the fisheries sector (using fishing vessels or facilities, for example, but with no direct link to fishing operations); and crimes committed elsewhere in the fisheries value chain (such as fraud or corruption).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is increasingly clear that criminality in the fisheries sector stands to evolve in a range of ways as the world warms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the specific intersections across and within these categories are poorly understood, the potential for crime convergence is well recognised. In numerous cases, for example, IUU fishing has been linked to modern slavery and human trafficking. Corruption is well known as a critical enabler of this activity, as are fraud and associated money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of changes to criminal activity in the fisheries sector can be expected as fish numbers and ranges shift with the warming of the world’s seas and oceans. Alongside damage caused by factors such as overfishing, there is evidence that oceanic warming will contribute to an ongoing decline in fish populations globally. In parallel, many species are expected to move poleward and to deeper waters as temperatures start to exceed tolerable thermal limits in a range of traditional fishing grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As fish populations respond, there are significant implications for those looking to catch them – both legally and illegally. Of specific interest here are the implications for those engaged in diverse illegal activities across the sector. Here, RUSI’s horizon scan identified a number of potential ways in which climate-induced shifts stand to alter criminal portfolios across the wider blue shadow economy, which can be grouped into three broad categories, as discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-shifting-use-of-fishing-vessels-in-drug-trafficking&quot;&gt;1. Shifting Use of Fishing Vessels in Drug Trafficking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of fishing vessels globally as a vector for drug trafficking operations is well known. Advantages include the cover offered by the established transport and distribution networks used in fishing operations, among others. A 2020 study found that the use of small fishing vessels to traffic drugs is on the rise globally (albeit without showing direct links to IUU fishing itself). Specifically, the use of fishing vessels in drug transhipment operations was found to have tripled in eight years, accounting for 15% of the global retail value of illegal drugs in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These crossovers originate at the local level and stand to evolve as key species move to cooler waters, out of reach of small-scale fishers. In key locations, collapsing stocks already risk driving artisanal fishers into drug trafficking, with the proceeds pumped back into fragile fisheries. There is also potential for these risks to be exacerbated by stricter conservation measures in key areas. The trajectory along which drugs travel across the oceans may thus increasingly begin with the story of failing fisheries and the ramifications for marginalised coastal communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet warming conditions do not mean that the use of fishing vessels to traffic drugs will inevitably increase. As fish stocks adjust to a warming climate, corresponding shifts in the transport and distribution routes used in fishing operations could make fishing vessels less attractive to those looking to move drugs, where such routes no longer meet the needs of local traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The use of fishing vessels globally as a vector for drug trafficking operations is well known&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of any of these scenarios, this evolving area of convergence must be met with stronger measures to protect livelihoods and enhance adaptive capacities among vulnerable fishing-dependent communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-role-of-iuu-fishing-in-fluid-criminal-portfolios&quot;&gt;2. Role of IUU Fishing in Fluid Criminal Portfolios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where illegal activities converge in the fisheries sector, the makeup of the relevant criminal portfolios is dictated by risk, reward and opportunity. Where IUU fishing forms part of these portfolios, climate-driven changes in the scarcity and distribution of key resources could influence their profitability and attractiveness compared with other, non-fisheries commodities that may serve as complements or substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, as fish stocks decline, criminal actors’ calculations could shift and income streams could fluctuate as awareness grows of the profits to be made from increasingly rare high-value species. Such awareness has seen species such as the Chinese bahaba pushed to commercial extinction, with individual fish previously selling for over $450,000. In this context, an apparent prioritisation of trade in declining species is increasingly driving cycles of rapid illegal exploitation – a trend likely to continue in warmer conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such short-lived “booms” have seen dwindling fisheries exploited by roving bandits as high-value species decline. As stocks collapse, those responsible move on to the next relevant species. One example concerns illegal fishing for the endangered totoaba – rare fish prized in China for their swim bladders. Fishing for totoaba using illegal gillnets has simultaneously pushed the diminutive, critically endangered vaquita to near-extinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet as fish stocks collapse or become less accessible in key locations, this could also place pressure on the profitability of IUU fishing itself. Here, the cost of accessing dwindling, displaced fish stocks could rise to the point of making IUU fishing for key species less attractive than other activities. In this scenario, ever-more sophisticated organised criminal operations could be required to access shrinking fishing grounds, with the cost and risk involved potentially outweighing associated gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More detailed research is needed to assess the impact of these factors on the fluctuating income streams and risk–reward calculations of actors engaged in criminality in the fisheries sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-changing-patterns-of-human-exploitation&quot;&gt;3. Changing Patterns of Human Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change stands to impact crime in the fisheries sector further in relation to the use of human trafficking for forced labour. This connection is long established, with many examples of IUU fishing and labour exploitation occurring simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the points at which these phenomena intersect stand to be influenced by a range of factors in a warming world. Notably, as fishing operators seek to offset pressure on profitability where they are forced to pursue dwindling fish stocks, they may increasingly resort to other measures to remain viable, including a greater reliance on human trafficking for forced labour and other illegal labour practices. Investigation and prosecution of relevant cases in the fisheries sector has long been inadequate, creating little in the way of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As fishing operators seek to offset pressure on profitability where they are forced to pursue dwindling fish stocks, they may increasingly resort to other measures to remain viable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeding into these dynamics are not only the effects of climate change at sea, but also the impacts on land. Climate-induced pressure on profitability is increasingly felt in land-based sectors such as agriculture, with displaced members of fragile farming communities in some locations potentially vulnerable to recruitment into debt-bonded labour on fishing vessels. There are also concerns that the emergence of rising numbers of climate refugees could provide a growing labour pool for actors engaged in IUU fishing to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These complex interrelationships stand to evolve as climate stress on land affects criminal behaviour at sea and vice versa. There is thus an ongoing need to address climate-related drivers of IUU fishing and associated criminal activity in the wider context of alternative (land- and sea-based) livelihood options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responding-to-convergence&quot;&gt;Responding to Convergence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A focus on these shifting crossovers must be prioritised as the world’s waters continue to warm. Such patterns of activity can confound established approaches, with agencies responsible for fisheries management often inadequately trained to identify other crimes. Where the portfolios of perpetrators transcend conventional categories of crime, relevant enforcement agencies must adapt to a more complex operating context – one that will continue to evolve in a warming climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet such intricacies can also offer opportunities. With penalties for IUU fishing often lax, criminal convergence presents options to prosecute criminal actors under alternative legislation – such as that linked to economic crime or drug trafficking. This may offer more robust sentencing options and thus more significant deterrents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To exploit such options and to maximise disruptive impact, it is crucial that ongoing, context-specific analysis is conducted to identify and target common “nodes” between crimes. Forecasting the ways in which such nodes stand to shift as the world’s seas and oceans warm is a crucial part of this picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jCoDvjN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（31日）踏入審訊第95天。何桂藍繼續接受盤問，就控方指「墨落無悔」是就協調會議已達成的共識簽署，何不同意，指理解「墨落」出現正因有參與者不同意聲明內容。控方亦質疑，何無告知公眾她不會否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求，惟何說：「我不嬲就係強調我一定會否決財政預算案吖嘛，就算五大訴求真係落實咗，我都可以否決㗎嘛」，法官亦提醒控方盤問有限度，證人沒說過不等於能反證其立場。控方亦指何桂藍與他人串謀無差別否決預算案，惟何指只有3種情況才屬無差別投票，包括議員不獲准辯論要直接表決、議員無傳召官員質詢，及如立法會前議員黃定光般「瞓咗無睇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何一度質疑控方提問「嘥時間」，法官着她冷靜，何指每次她問題不獲解答就被指不冷靜，但「我從來都冇激動過」。何今完成10天作供，料明將由陳志全作供。何作供完畢後面露興奮說「yes!」、「完——！」，又向身旁傳譯主任鞠躬說「辛苦晒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指王百羽等提我哋是代表何-何指理解不代表她發言&quot;&gt;控方指王百羽等提「我哋」是代表何 何指理解不代表她發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍今第10天作供，繼續接受控方盤問。主控萬德豪續問及抗爭派記者會上其他人發言是否代表何，包括播片指何當時站在岑敖暉的右後方，而岑回答記者指「我哋」會堅定行使基本法權力否決預算案前，曾望向何桂藍的方向。林卓廷說「吓」，吳政亨亦發笑，法官陳慶偉即打斷：「Submission point, thank you.（留待陳詞，謝謝。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續引王百羽提及「我哋嗰個最大公因數」是如五大訴求無落實，會堅決反對財政預算案，又稱是「我哋共同嘅諗法」。萬指王提及「我哋」是包括何桂藍，何說「佢可能係咁嘅意思啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬問那何會後有否告訴王，不應代表她說話？何續指「我理解佢冇代表我講嘢喎」，並指在記者會用「我哋」很常見，「如果每一次人哋用『我哋』嘅話都即刻跳出嚟話『喂等等先我哋冇傾喎』，咁個記者會開唔到」，又指岑敖暉和王百羽的講法本身與她的想法有否相同或相異之處，完全是另一問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指控方提問浪費時間-官着何冷靜-何指從無激動過&quot;&gt;何指控方提問浪費時間 官着何冷靜 何指從無激動過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，明白萬德豪打算在結案陳詞說的話，但認為那些真的只應留待陳詞（submission point），而何亦已回答問題。萬德豪續問何會後有否告訴岑敖暉、王百羽和梁晃維，他們看法不代表她。何靜默一會，李運騰指只需答是、否或者不記得，何說「我諗緊點解需要咁樣講啫」，後再稱「冇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續追問，當日記者離開前，何有否向他們指上述人士說法不代表她，何說「我會唔會反對財政預算案同埋基於咩原因呢，我之前已經講咗半晝㗎喇」，而她理解控方是指記者會說法與她早前說法有出入，問她有否改變想法，何說「答案係冇嘅」，但「冇記者會坐喺度聽你講半晝嗰啲分別係咩分別」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指那不是控方問題，指控方只是問她有否告訴他人岑敖暉等說法不代表她，重申只需答是、否或不記得。何說「我而家就係話緊呢個問題好奇怪」，李指不論是否奇怪何也要回答，何說「我頭先咪答咗」，李問她的答案是？何說「第三次，NO」，並望向萬德豪：「你係咪問第四次喇？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉打斷稱：「這完全不好笑。（“This is not funny at all.”）」，何說「我都唔覺得好笑，我覺得好嘥時間」。陳慶偉說若是浪費他或法庭時間，他便會叫停，但不是由何決定。何即說：「你時間係時間，我時間唔係時間，OK！」李運騰續說「請冷靜，請冷靜，問題會否影響裁決是由法庭決定」，何續說：「每次我嘅問題不獲解答就話我唔冷靜要我 calm down 嘅，但我從來都冇激動過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續補充，民主派經常十幾廿個政黨一齊開記者會，「唔會話次次所有嘢都傾實都照答記者問題」，故她不明白剛才問題，因她不覺得記者會上有人提及無經討論的東西，「其他人會好自然咁覺得嗰啲係在場所有人嘅認知⋯⋯我唔認為喺法庭捉住一兩隻字就可以改變大家呢個認知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指墨落無悔是就已達成的共識簽署-何不同意-指有無法同意的事項&quot;&gt;控方指「墨落無悔」是就已達成的共識簽署 何不同意 指有無法同意的事項&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦問及「墨落無悔」聲明，質疑聲明是協調會議達成的共識。萬德豪先逐段讀出，何說「可唔可以直接問問題」，萬續着她讀第二段，並在何看完後問她是否可讀中文（“You read Chinese?”），何即攤出左手反問：「咁都唔係一個嘥時間嘅問題？我識睇中文，睇咗30年」，旁聽席發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RNo7u0k.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第二段：「我們認為，在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎。考慮到立場差異，此一綱領已達致抗爭陣營光譜的最大公因數。墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」，萬提到是指在協調會議已取得共識，尚欠簽名，發起人是邀請參選人就已達成的共識簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何不同意，指理解只是談及簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，又強調已取得的共識「都未形成一份大家都 agree 咗嘅文件」，故「冇簽過任何嘢」、「冇嘢可以簽」；她亦不同意「共同綱領」和「共識」是同一回事，指她理解「共同綱領」為一份大家同意的文件，但在新東「呢份嘢係冇出現過」，並非「簽咗定未簽」的問題，「係連份嘢都未 agree。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又指，她理解的共識是「幾時搞初選、係公民投票、有論壇」，形容「呢啲嘢係應該幾區都有嘅」，但亦理解至少像新東，其他區也有無法同意的事項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指墨落無悔出現正因有參與協調者不願意簽&quot;&gt;何指「墨落無悔」出現正因有參與協調者不願意簽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，發起人突然要求簽署一份新的、沒有達成共識的聲明，何不覺得荒謬（absurd）嗎？何指，「不如咁樣講，如果真係有一個共識係大家都同意呢兩點，咁點解最後戴耀廷唔要求大家簽，或者有人向戴耀廷表示佢唔想簽呢？」，並指無論基於什麼原因不願意公開表明立場，她理解「墨落」為何出現，「正正係因為喺參與協調會嘅人當中，有人唔願意或者唔同意呢啲嘢啊嘛。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，簽「墨落」是個人決定，她看到聲明兩點「我同意我咪簽囉」。萬再追問「墨落理應無悔」是指就共識簽署，何指理解「墨落」兩字「真係拎住筆喺張紙簽名，啲墨落咗喺啲紙上面」，是指「墨落無悔」聲明，而非指協調會議的討論或共識。何又指聲明開放予五個選區的人簽署，理解「區同區之間根本都冇任何討論」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指墨落內容有在會上討論但並非共識-官提醒控方知道面對的控制&quot;&gt;何指「墨落」內容有在會上討論但並非共識 官提醒控方知道面對的控制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，何有否告訴發起人參與者並無達成共識，何表示沒有，指這與個人是否認同聲明和是否簽署「冇乜關係」。萬再問，即是發起人要求他們簽署沒有跨區同意、新的東西？何指萬將「新」和無共識混淆，指這些東西當然在會上有討論，但有否共識是另一回事，「佢唔係新嘢，與此同時佢都唔係共識。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬再問，何是否知道發起人為何提及已取得共識，陳慶偉指是要求證人揣測。萬續提高聲線再問何：「你知道原因嗎？」惟陳慶偉再打斷指只是以不同方式問同一條問題。李運騰續說根據區諾軒，運用基本法權力的條款五區中至少有兩個版本（「會」及「會積極」），亦無證據顯示有跨選區的共識；又指控方除區諾軒外並無其他證人可證明該點，指法庭並非要下結論，「但你要知道你所面對的限制。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍不同意戴耀廷提聯合聲明指墨落無悔&quot;&gt;何桂藍不同意戴耀廷提「聯合聲明」指「墨落無悔」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪其後引戴耀廷6月12日予參與者的訊息，提到不用簽協議是他個人決定，又指「是否簽署聯合的聲明，確立之前的承諾，是大家自行的決定」。萬指「聯合的聲明」是指「墨落無悔」，何認為不能這樣揣測，亦覺得戴並非特定指明「墨落」，因其他區也有另外簽一些文件提交。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉亦指留意到戴提及「將來若出現紛爭，我會真誠地見證大家的協議是甚麼」，反問「那怎能是指『墨落無悔』？」，並指在此語境，認為戴是談及協調會議的協議。萬德豪欲追問何是否知道戴為何寫這則訊息，惟陳慶偉再打斷：「No, thank you.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指協調的協議實然存-何明顯非任何參選人理解&quot;&gt;區諾軒指「協調的協議實然存」 何：明顯非任何參選人理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引不同組織者說法，指協調共識包括否決財案。就區諾軒6月19日文章〈以正視聽——假如我有資格回應抗爭派立場聲明書發起人〉，提及：「就算沒有一份文件出台，但協調的協議實然存在⋯⋯沒有公開，不等於參與過的人沒有承諾遵守。諸如五大訴求、怎樣停止選舉工程、否決財政預算案，如果協議沒有約束力，那多次會議得來的共識，便毫無意義。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指區提及否決預算案是協調會議共識，何說「區諾軒嘅意思可能係咁」，而她事後沒有問區為何說這是共識，是因「其實去到嗰個地步，organiser 再講啲咩其實都毫無意義，因為好明顯『協調的協議實然存在』唔係任何 candidate 嘅理解啦，如果唔係就一早簽咗（協議）啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷稱不會愚蠢到製造dq藉口-何質疑唔通簽協議唔係共識咩&quot;&gt;戴耀廷稱不會愚蠢到製造DQ藉口 何質疑：唔通簽協議唔係共識咩？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後引戴耀廷於6月9日記者會提及在協調過程有共識，知道為何望爭取35+，但在《國安法》下，「我哋唔會愚蠢到自己去製造一個藉口畀呢個當權者嚟去DQ我哋參與呢個計劃嘅人」，指何會理解戴指的共識是否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EFAdk0g.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續說：「睇完我更加唔明喎，咁唔通簽協議唔係共識咩？咁點解可以單方面話呢個係愚蠢嘅共識跟住就話唔要呀？」，又指「我理解嘅共識係有份嘢會擺喺提名表喎，我第一次 realise 佢當日係咁樣講，唔係好明點解會變咗做愚蠢？」萬問何即是不同意？何說：「完全唔知道佢呢度講嘅共識係咩囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，在5月5日新東第二次會議至6月9日記者會期間，何是否完全沒有追問組織者何時舉行下次會議，何不同意，指應該有問區諾軒。萬說是何第一次告訴法庭，陳慶偉即打斷說：「Move on, move on please.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指支持迫使特首回應五大訴求但不認為否決財案可迫特首回應&quot;&gt;何指支持迫使特首回應五大訴求、但不認為否決財案可迫特首回應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就「墨落無悔」第一點聲明：「我認同『五大訴求，缺一不可』。我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，何指支持迫使特首回應五大訴求，但「從來都冇人 define 過究竟五大訴求係咩」；又指因認為否決財案無辦法迫特首回應五大訴求，故就整句「冇話支持唔支持」，並確認無向其他人提過認為否決財案不能迫特首回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何亦同意無向發起人反映不同意將否決財案和五大訴求綑綁，因理解聲明是處理「避唔避DQ」的問題。何亦重申，沒有收過戴耀廷發出的新東最終協議文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指何無告知公眾不會否決財案-何我不嬲就係強調我一定會否決&quot;&gt;控方指何無告知公眾不會否決財案 何：我不嬲就係強調我一定會否決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續指何沒有告訴過公眾，她不會否決預算案迫使政府回應五大訴求。何說：「唔係，我不嬲就係強調我一定會否決財政預算案吖嘛，就算五大訴求真係落實咗，我都可以否決㗎嘛」，林卓廷、陳志全等大笑。李運騰亦指證人已說過很多次。萬續指其問題不只是否決預算案，而是迫政府回應五大訴求，並再重複問題。何答：「我從來冇向公眾講過我唔會否決財政預算案，whatever the reason。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，認為控方循此方向盤問也有限度，指證人有權維持緘默，沒說過不等於能反證其立場。（“The fact that she didn’t say anything does not prove the contrary, there is a limit how far you can go.”）萬回應，會這樣問是因何桂藍有簽署「墨落無悔」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，何桂藍早前曾供稱，認為預算案存有「財政黑洞」、議員無法盡責審議，投反對票才是履行議員責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指何串謀無差別否決財案-何指僅3情況會無差別投票&quot;&gt;控方指何串謀無差別否決財案 何指僅3情況會無差別投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續向何指出控方案情，指她與他人串謀取得立法會主導權，以無差別否決預算案。何回應，她理解在立法會要無差別就議案投票有3種情況，第一種是被動，如立法會主席梁君彥有時會批准議員提修正案，但完全不予辯論時間，要求直接表決，令議員「無辦法做任何審議就要投票㗎喇」，亦是2018年區諾軒遇到的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二種情況則是主動，如2021年初財委會試過在「冇 call 官員嚟質詢、冇任何辯論嘅情況下」通過了8個項目，共涉300億，何引時任財委會主席陳健波指議員可傳召官員，但要前一日通知，「但冇一個建制派議員記得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第三種情況，何說「就係好似黃定光咁直程喺議會瞓咗冇睇嘅」，旁聽席大笑，何即微微轉頭嚴肅說：「呢個唔係一個笑話 sorry。」何指除了上述三種情況，「我理解唔到點解喺立法會入面，會有任何議案係 indiscriminately 咁投票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mQRUka9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指控方毋須再指出案情-指何已回答不見有何作用&quot;&gt;官指控方毋須再指出案情 指何已回答、不見有何作用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續指，其問題只需答是或否，就是何有沒有與其他被告串謀。惟法官陳慶偉打斷指萬毋須問此問題，指明白控方在指出案情，但 Beel 已問過相關問題。萬指他有責任這樣做，惟李運騰指 Beel 已將控方指控向被告指出，她已回答，控方重複再做並非善用時間，亦不見任何作用；陳慶偉亦說何桂藍已就此回答，「她的答案是不同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬終表示沒有其他問題，何桂藍即面露興奮握拳輕聲說「yes!」。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 一度擬於明早進行覆問，惟何即不情願說：「唔好啦！」被告和旁聽人士大笑。Beel 續問及，何今早指理解王百羽不是代表她說話，那就岑敖暉和梁晃維的說法是否也有同樣理解，何答「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍完成作供-明將由陳志全作供&quot;&gt;何桂藍完成作供 明將由陳志全作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指沒有其他問題，亦不會傳召其他證人，何桂藍案情完結。何興奮歎道：「呀！完——！」，並笑着靠後飲水，又一度微微站起身想要離開。法官續關注案件進度，問能否於8月尾前完結證供，萬德豪指對此感樂觀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑則指，相信鄒是餘下證供最長的證人，法官陳慶偉續說 Beel 早前也說何桂藍主問需時兩天，李運騰笑指那並不能相信。陳世傑指現時有不多於200條問題，但應不會太長，預計能於3至4天內完成主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉下令案件明續審，料明將由陳志全作供，新東尚餘不認罪被告包括陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及柯耀林。散庭時，何桂藍站起向身旁的法庭傳譯主任鞠躬道謝，數度說「辛苦晒」，又轉身望向旁聽席微笑和以手勢交流。另歌手黃耀明下午亦有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑何無提35不可能-何強調即使不可能仍要取相應票數&quot;&gt;控方質疑何無提35+不可能 何強調即使不可能仍要取相應票數&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方今亦問及何桂藍6月26日發布，與岑敖暉拍攝有關《國安法》的片段，引何片中提及國安法是中共為香港設下的局，國安會「無差別拘捕（indiscriminately）」。惟何指她提到的是「濫捕」而非「無差別」，「我 dispute（不贊同）緊你 indiscriminately 嗰個 translation」，萬說他只是從英文謄本讀出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續引何片中提到香港人如何「破局」，就是民主派如在立會選舉「達成一個不可能嘅任務，攞到35席，攞到立法會過半嘅主導權，我哋就可以逼出一個北京冇可能接受到嘅局面，從而令到佢用更加瘋狂嘅方式去應對，要付出更加高昂嘅政治代價」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬質疑何是宣傳要取得35席，何不同意，因35+是不可能亦是北京無可能接受的局面，又指在DQ將發生下，她將「攞到過半」和「攞到過半所需嘅得票」兩者「撈埋咗」。萬質疑她沒有告訴觀眾35+是不可能，何說「因為如果咁樣講，佢哋連票都唔會投囉」，強調想傳遞的訊息從來都是「就算攞唔到（35+），都要投票，攞到相應嘅票數」，即使是不可能，「唔等於我哋唔需要投呢個局面出嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指逼北京瘋狂應對為攬炒-何北京如何應對非攬炒是單方面破壞香港&quot;&gt;控方指逼北京瘋狂應對為「攬炒」 何：北京如何應對非攬炒、是單方面破壞香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續指，何說要令北京以更瘋狂方式應對，是要加劇「攬炒」，何說「北京用咩方式去應對，嗰個就唔係『攬炒』，係佢單方面 destruct（破壞）香港喇」，重申「攬炒」的假定或預測，就是中共「好容易 overreact（過度反應）」，而此預測是來自過去多年中共表現的「慣性」：「就係每一次佢哋意識到佢哋喺個制度入面有可能輸或者被挑戰，佢哋會直接破壞個制度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問片段配上「國際關注重燃 圍堵中國反制」字句，是否指國際制裁。何否認，指是「國際關注」，解釋每次香港發生了一些「好離譜嘅打壓事件」，都會成為全世界媒體焦點，當地民眾或公民社會會發起聲援香港的行動。萬問那該些國家會做什麼？陳慶偉打斷指認為不相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指取得35對何是好消息-何否認指被dq反是好事&quot;&gt;控方指取得35+對何是好消息 何否認指被DQ反是好事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後就初選論壇發問，再質疑何知道35+可能不能達成但仍爭取35+。何重申是爭取達成35+所需的票數而不是35席。萬再指如可達成35+，對何來說會是很好的消息，惟何即說：「唔會呀，因為如果35+，選立法會嗰日警察就衝入去 chamber 㗎喇，正如我所講，被DQ反而係一件好事。」萬欲追問何不能肯定警察會衝入去，惟陳慶偉即打斷說：「Thank you, thank you.」&lt;/p&gt;

For each category, the report examines how the size and composition of Russian weapons portfolios in Ukraine are changing under the twin influences of attrition and sanctions, while taking account of Russian efforts to increase defense production and otherwise replenish its forces. It concludes by assessing the impact of Russia’s declining weapons portfolios in Ukraine on its ability to carry out future operations against Kyiv, as well as in other regions of interest such as Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and the Caucasus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report finds that the magnitude of Russian equipment losses and ammunition usage in Ukraine is having a major negative effect on the Kremlin’s ability to prosecute the war. In each of the five categories, Russian defense production is struggling to keep pace with its growing losses on the battlefield due to sanctions and capacity limitations, although they have been offset to some extent by various stopgap measures. The resulting decline in the size and quality of Russian weapons portfolio in Ukraine are further undermining Russia’s ability to sustain operations. Growing signs of an impending ammunition shortage are particularly problematic since Russian forces in Ukraine rely so heavily on artillery to sustain operations. By contrast, the Ukrainian military has been able to rely on a steady influx of Western military equipment to replenish its forces and preserve its combat power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resulting shifts in the balance of forces are creating a window of opportunity for Ukraine to renew its counteroffensive and recover additional territory. It is not clear, however, whether conditions are ripe enough yet for Kyiv to make enough gains to decisively seize the initiative and escape the current cycle of attrition altogether. So far, equipment and ammunition shortages have tended to undermine Russia’s offensive capabilities more than they have its defensive capabilities. Moreover, the Kremlin is making a concerted effort to mobilize defense production. Given its enormous prewar equipment stockpiles, remaining defense production capabilities, and continuing support from countries still willing to do business with Russia, the Kremlin likely still retains the capacity to reverse recent declines in its weapons portfolio and replenish its forces in Ukraine at levels sufficient to continue the war effort, albeit with some limitations. However, the prolonged invasion coupled with heavy manpower and equipment losses will likely limit Moscow’s ability to engage in high-intensity conventional military operations in other areas, at least in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report, which was drafted in May 2023, is the second report in a series exploring Russia’s defense industry under the allied sanctions and export controls. The first report examined the impact of sanctions on the Kremlin’s ability to manufacture and sustain advanced weapons systems without direct access to higher-end Western components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s armed forces entered the war in Ukraine with formidable advantages in military equipment and technology over the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). On paper at least, the Russian military was particularly well equipped for the task, with ample armor, artillery, and precision strike weapons, as well as an impressive array of combat support systems, including uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and electronic warfare (EW). During the initial invasion, however, Russian forces significantly underperformed while their ambitious multi-axis strategy intended to rapidly dislocate Ukrainian forces, seize major cities in the east, surround Kyiv, and install a pro-Kremlin regime quickly faltered, leaving Moscow embroiled in a long and brutal war of attrition centered primarily on southeastern Ukraine but encompassing missile strikes across the country. After more than a year of high-intensity combat, Russian forces in Ukraine have incurred enormous losses in troops and matériel and have been significantly attrited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is urgently seeking to replace its equipment losses by mobilizing its defense base and ramping up production. Russian leaders are also pursuing a variety of stopgap measures, withdrawing Soviet-era equipment from storage, and purchasing matériel from Iran and North Korea. Thus far, however, such measures have fallen short of what is needed to replenish Russia’s equipment stocks. Consequently, Russian forces in Ukraine are now trapped in a cycle of attrition and are facing shortages of equipment and ammunition, at least over the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report assesses the extent to which Moscow’s growing equipment and ammunition shortages from sustained attrition are affecting its ability to prosecute the war in Ukraine, as well as conduct military operations in other areas. It starts by examining the extent to which Russian losses are changing the composition of its forces in Ukraine — and their weapons portfolios — while also taking account of Russian efforts to replace those losses. These findings are then used to assess how reductions in the size, quality, and composition of Russian equipment stocks are affecting the military’s ability to prosecute the war in Ukraine and conduct potential future operations in other regions of interest, including Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and the South Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than a year of war, the magnitude of Russia’s equipment losses in Ukraine is hurting its ability to prosecute the war. Growing artillery ammunition shortages, in particular, are casting doubt on coming operations. Defense production rates are failing to keep pace with losses on the battlefield. Moscow is attempting to boost production, but such efforts are being undermined by Western sanctions and enduring capacity constraints. Efforts at import substitution are facing difficulties as well due to the country’s enduring technological deficiencies and its lack of access to advanced machine tools. Stopgap measures (e.g., fielding legacy tanks taken from storage) are undermining the quality of Russian equipment in Ukraine. While Russian leaders continue to struggle with reconstituting their forces, military commanders on the ground are having to make do with a significantly degraded fighting force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting equipment and ammunition shortages are clearly undermining Russia’s ability to sustain operations in Ukraine. However, the impact is uneven, affecting some capabilities more than others. Thus far, they have tended to undermine Russia’s offensive capabilities more than they have its defensive capabilities. Unusually high tank losses have further reduced the military’s ability to maneuver. Russian artillery losses and growing ammunition shortages have the potential to be even more consequential, as this could substantially undercut Russia’s ability to sustain mass fires during coming operations. By contrast, Moscow has thus far been able to maintain a relatively high tempo of drone and EW operations despite substantial losses since it has been able to tap into external sources in the first case and to maintain adequate inventories in the second. Moscow has also been able to sustain its long-range precision strike campaign despite having drawn down its initial missile stocks by shifting to a lower-cost and more sustainable mix of missiles and one-way attack drones. It is important to remember, however, that each weapons category is to some extent dependent on the others, such that degrading capability in one area can also affect others. This is the case with Russian drone losses, which provide essential targeting data for Russian artillery. On the other hand, maintaining strength in one area can often help compensate for weaknesses in other areas. Russian advantages in artillery have been used to compensate for deficiencies in Russian maneuver units, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is important to remember, however, that each weapons category is to some extent dependent on the others, such that degrading capability in one area can also affect others.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, Russia’s growing losses in troops and matériel have left it increasingly vulnerable to a potential AFU counteroffensive. However, it is unclear how long this situation will endure. As the first report in this series noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Available evidence indicates that the Kremlin will still be able to maintain its war efforts in Ukraine. Sanctions and export controls are not a silver bullet that will force Russia to bring the war to an end. Russia’s large prewar equipment stockpiles, its massive military industrial complex, and the prioritization of defense production . . . as part of Moscow’s wartime mobilization are likely to enable the Kremlin to continue to wage war in Ukraine, albeit with limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, therefore, Russian leaders are likely to find ways to reconstitute their forces, as discussed further below. In the meantime, despite heavy losses, the Russian military still has significant troops and equipment in Ukraine that it can call upon to defend its gains. Thus, it is not clear how long this window will remain open and whether conditions are ripe enough yet for Ukraine to break the cycle of its attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report will examine these issues in greater detail, focusing on the evolving state of Russian equipment inventories in five key weapons categories: main battle tanks (MBTs), artillery, UAVs, EW, and theater precision strike weapons. The report will commence by examining changes in inventory levels for each weapons category due to attrition and the resulting impact on the size, quality, and character of the force, taking account of Russian efforts at replenishment. These findings are then used to gauge the impact of resulting shortages on Russia’s ability to prosecute the war in Ukraine. Next, the report will examine the broader implications of Russian ammunition and equipment shortages on the military’s ability to conduct operations in other areas, including Central Asia (the case of Kazakhstan), the Middle East and North Africa (the case of Syria), and the Caucasus (the case of Georgia). The report concludes with a summary of its key findings, followed by recommendations for policymakers to help prioritize future equipment transfers for Ukraine and refine sanctions efforts in ways that will help shift the balance of forces more in Ukraine’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;main-battle-tanks&quot;&gt;Main Battle Tanks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHANGES IN FORCE POSTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maneuver warfare has long been a pillar of Russia’s way of war, with Russian tank groupings playing a central role in such operations. On paper at least, Russia’s tank and motorized infantry units are particularly well equipped for the mission with large numbers of tanks and other armored vehicles, as well as organic artillery. During the initial invasion, however, Russia’s attempts at armored maneuver warfare were largely unsuccessful, except in the south. Instead, Ukrainian forces were able to make effective use of an array of anti-tank and related weapons to exact a heavy toll on Russian tanks and armored vehicles, while helping blunt Russia’s offensive. Since then, Russian tank losses have continued to mount, leading military commanders to adjust their tactics and use tanks in different roles, but with mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia entered the war in Ukraine with a frontline force of around 2,927 main battle tanks according to the Military Balance 2022. This was comprised of a combination of Russian frontline tanks, including approximately 2,030 T-72s, 480 T-80s, and 417 T-90s of various kinds. Russian tanks in Ukraine are based on Soviet-era designs that have been incrementally upgraded over the last thirty years. The most advanced models employed by Russia during the initial invasion included the T-72B3M, T-90M, and T-80BVM; however, Russia’s invasion force also included many earlier versions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By February 2023, Russia had lost at least 1,900 MBTs according to Oryx (abandoned, captured, or destroyed) — around two-thirds of its original total. Since Oryx only reports on tank losses that it is able to verify, Russia’s actual tank losses likely exceed this amount by a significant margin. This means at a minimum Russia has been losing, on average, around 150 tanks per month. According to anecdotal evidence provided by Ukrainian colleagues from CACDS consulted for this report, the shortage of tanks and armored vehicles in some Russian ground force units is reaching upwards of 60–70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia’s actual tank production capacity is a matter of significant debate, thus far, Russian tank factories are falling well short of producing enough tanks to replace its losses in Ukraine. In recent years, Russian tank factories were able to produce on average around 250 new and modernized T-72B3, T-80BVM, and T-90M main battle tanks each year. In December 2022, Russian minister of defense Sergei Shoigu reported that the defense industry had achieved a 30 percent increase in production of basic weapons over the previous year. Assuming this also applies to main battle tanks, that would bring annual production up to 325 tanks per year. According to another recent report, Russia can likely restore another 600 old Soviet-era tanks taken from storage per year. Even when these two figures are added, the total still falls well short of the 1,900 tanks needed to replace its losses in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia’s tank industry is striving to increase production, it currently lacks the capacity to produce enough new or upgraded tanks to replace its losses. It will take months and in many cases years to add new plants and equipment, hire skilled workers, and establish supply chains. Moreover, expanding capacity is likely to be complicated to some extent by loss of access to high-end Western machine tools currently blocked by sanctions, even though Russia is finding ways to maintain access to some Western machinery in spite of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions are complicating Russian tank production in other ways, as well. As mentioned in the first report in this series, in some cases, Russian tanks are being delivered without some of their most advanced subsystems, such as the SOSNA-U targeting system, which relies on a French thermal imager. Imports of these components are now banned due to sanctions, leading Russia to install less capable legacy gun sights on replacement tanks. Sanctions are likely to further complicate Russian defense production given the continuing presence of Western components and electronics in Russian MBTs. Shifting to import substitution or finding workable replacements will be difficult and will likely drive up costs and/or lead to reductions in quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Although Russia’s tank industry is striving to increase production, it currently lacks the capacity to produce enough new or upgraded tanks to replace its losses. It will take time to add new plants and equipment, hire skilled workers, and establish supply chains.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of such production problems, starting in May 2022, Russia began pulling older Soviet-era tanks out of storage, refurbishing them, and sending them to Ukraine. These include various legacy models, such as the T-62, T-55, and T-54, the latter first introduced in the 1950s. Most of these tanks have subpar capabilities, which will reduce their effectiveness on the modern battlefield. Yet, as noted above, Russian forces are only projected to receive around 600 of these refurbished Soviet-era tanks per year. Moreover, sustaining even this total may prove challenging for Russia, since those tanks remaining in storage will likely require even more extensive refurbishment. Yet, even when combined with the 240–325 additional tanks currently produced each year by Uralvagonzavod, the monthly total of around 80–90 tanks per month still falls well short of the 150 tanks needed to replace its losses. It should be noted, however, that Moscow appears to be holding several hundred of its most advanced T-90 tanks in reserve, possibly to support a future NATO contingency, and could potentially draw upon these if needed in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Russian defense industry is likely to eventually find ways to increase tank production, including drawing upon thousands of older tanks in storage to sustain its forces, although the remaining tanks will likely require more extensive refurbishment. Yet, over the near term at least, Russian forces will continue to face shortages and will have to make do with a markedly diminished tank force, one with substantially fewer tanks and declining quality levels as the proportion of legacy tanks taken from storage increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPERATIONAL IMPACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the tactical level, the decline in the quality of Russian tanks used in Ukraine has reduced their effectiveness to some extent. Without the SOSNA-U targeting system, for example, Russian tanks are facing greater difficulties in detecting and targeting Ukrainian forces at long range, especially at night. As a result, these tanks have lost their first fire advantage, leaving them vulnerable to strikes by Ukrainian forces who spot them first. Likewise, Russia’s thin-skinned legacy tanks, such as the T-62, which the Russians have been fielding in Ukraine, have less than half the frontal armor protection of today’s main battle tanks and their turret roof armor is especially thin, leaving them even more susceptible to Ukrainian anti-tank weapons ranging from rocket-propelled grenades to artillery. Moreover, the legacy guns on older Russian tanks will be less able to penetrate thicker armor on the latest Western tanks used by Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the tactical-operational level, reductions in the size and quality of Russia’s tank forces in Ukraine are having a more pronounced effect on Russia’s ability to prosecute the war. For one, Russia’s ability to conduct armored maneuver warfare has been markedly diminished by the reductions (along with Russian troop losses, shortages of artillery ammunition, and other factors). That said, Russian forces have struggled with combined arms maneuver even when they had a full complement of their best frontline tanks, indicating more fundamental failings in operational planning, training, and leadership. At the outset of the campaign, Russian attempts to defeat Ukraine in a lightning campaign using concentrated armor were largely unsuccessful (except in the south). Although they made advances in some areas, they also incurred heavy tank losses from Ukrainian units supported by a dense network of artillery and anti-tank weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VXP2tP2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A Russian tank destroyed by Ukrainian forces in Luhansk Oblast on February 26, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the campaign progressed, and as tank and personnel losses mounted, Russian forces have had even less success with armored maneuver warfare, even on a smaller scale. For example, during the Donbas campaign in April–May 2022, Russian forces attempted to break through AFU lines around Izyum with the apparent objective of enveloping Ukrainian forces in the Donbas. Ultimately, they incurred heavy tank losses while making only limited gains. Once the campaign transitioned to a war of attrition, Russia’s ability to maneuver declined even further, though troop shortages, poor training, and tactical deficiencies have also played a role. Given the diminished size and quality of Russia’s tank force, persistent tactical deficiencies, and the heavy attrition incurred by the force as a whole, Russia’s ability to conduct armored maneuver is likely to remain limited until it can replenish its forces and improve combat proficiency, condemning Russia for now to an attrition strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Russian armor has retained the ability to operate effectively when used with infantry in an assault role. Russian ground forces enjoyed local tactical successes when using tanks in this manner, as demonstrated during the grinding, large-scale Russian offensives carried out in the Donbas in mid-2022 and more recently in Bakhmut. Under this approach, concentrated Russian infantry backed by tanks, armored vehicles, and massed artillery have had success at times in conducting sustained frontal assaults against entrenched Ukrainian forces. In some cases, tanks were used in combination with infantry to conduct armored assaults on AFU defensive positions, while in others they were used in a standoff role to provide mobile fire support. In several cases, Russian forces were able to make steady incremental gains over time by wearing down Ukrainian defenders, exploiting weak points within their front lines and compelling them to retreat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that for operations such as this, reductions in the quality of Russian tank forces are less important, so long as a sufficient number of tanks are available to support the operation. Moreover, even legacy Soviet-era tanks will generally suffice for such assaults since mobility, firepower, and protection are what matter most in such cases. Nevertheless, the Russian army has incurred serious tank losses during such operations, and they were not always successful. Given the continuing high attrition rates experienced during such operations, the ability and willingness of Russian commanders to undertake them is likely to diminish as well, at least over the near term. According to recent testimony by U.S. intelligence officials, Russian forces will be increasingly challenged to conduct even modest offensive operations absent further mobilization and additional ammunition supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;artillery-and-ammunition&quot;&gt;Artillery and Ammunition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHANGES IN FORCE POSTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery has traditionally held a central place in Russian military doctrine. Russian maneuver brigades and dedicated artillery and rocket brigades are particularly well equipped with towed and self-propelled artillery and multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS). Russian forces in Ukraine have relied heavily on their artillery and MLRS to support offensive and defensive operations and to degrade Ukrainian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war has progressed, however, Russian artillery losses have continued to mount while ammunition stockpiles have exhibited growing signs of depletion due to exceptionally high ammunition usage rates. Russia’s declining ammunition stockpiles are particularly problematic for Russian forces since the Kremlin’s strategy of attrition is critically dependent on artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian artillery and rocket forces had over 4,894 artillery platforms in active service in 2022 according to The Military Balance 2022. These included 2,118 self-propelled and towed howitzers, 1,056 MLRS, and 1,720 heavy mortars. Moreover, Russia also maintains thousands of artillery and MLRS platforms in storage. This was sufficient to provide Russia with an enormous advantage in firepower over Ukraine at the start of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Russian forces have lost a substantial number of artillery, including at least 486 artillery systems and 191 MLRS (captured, abandoned, or destroyed), as of February 2023. Even more importantly, they have expended enormous amounts of both tubed and rocket artillery ammunition during the war, on average using around 20,000 shells per day throughout last year, and as many as 40,000 shells per day during peak periods of the spring and summer offensives in 2022. Despite its large prewar ammunition stockpiles, such intensive rates of fire are proving unsustainable, even for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3oXDvsV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ This photo, taken on December 7, 2022, shows collected remnants of shells and missiles used by Russian forces in their attack against the second-largest Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with such issues, Russia is pursuing a range of measures to sustain its artillery and rocket forces in Ukraine. Russian defense firms continue to deliver new and upgraded artillery systems for the front. Yet current production rates are insufficient to replace Russia’s losses in Ukraine. The defense industry is also taking measures to increase artillery production, working extra shifts, and rallying the artillery sector to improve efficiencies. Efforts to ramp up production have been hindered by sanctions, however, which are restricting Russia’s ability to obtain high-end Western machine tools and high-quality gun steel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia faces even greater challenges in maintaining ammunition supply for its artillery and rocket forces. Ammunition shortages are much more of a limiting factor for Russia than are its artillery losses, since Russia still has enough guns to bring mass firepower to bear when needed. At first glance, it appears that Russian defense firms continue to deliver substantial amounts of artillery and MLRS ammunition. According to the Russian defense conglomerate Rostec, ammunition production has now reached a new 10-year high. However, current production rates for 122-millimeter and 152-millimeter artillery shells — both Soviet-standard ammunition — appear wholly inadequate to replenish existing stockpiles given current expenditure levels. The same is true of production of rocket ammunition for Russian MLRS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, the Kremlin has been turning to North Korea and Iran for additional artillery ammunition. Although not insignificant, the amounts involved so far are unlikely to materially improve Russia’s supply situation. Consequently, Russia continues to dig deeply into its existing munition stocks to sustain operations, amid growing signs of depletion. One U.S. official reported that Russia is now using 40-year-old artillery shells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the foregoing factors, the Russian military is liable to face a serious shortage of artillery ammunition during the next phase of the war and will likely have to operate with a partially depleted artillery force. For much of the war, Russian artillery and rocket forces have been able to operate at a high tempo while maintaining fire superiority over Ukrainian forces. In December, however, U.S. officials reported that Russian artillery fires had declined by 75 percent, fueling speculation that Russia may be running dangerously low on artillery ammunition or attempting to conserve ammunition. In April 2023, the Russian private military company Wagner Group’s chief, Yevgeny Prighozin, admitted as much, threatening to withdraw his forces from the front due to ongoing ammunition shortages. Yet Russian forces have been able for the most part to sustain a high tempo of artillery fire during recent ground offensives in Bakhmut and Avdiyivka. Given Russia’s growing signs of shell hunger, however, its forces may soon find themselves forced to ration artillery usage even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPERATIONAL IMPACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s declining artillery and munition stocks are likely to have a major impact on Russian military operations in Ukraine, if not properly addressed. An inability to sustain artillery fires at previous levels would seriously undermine Russia’s ability to effectively prosecute the war. Russian forces continue to rely heavily on artillery to offset deficiencies in other areas, including infantry, armor, and close air support. Artillery also plays a central role in Russia’s attrition strategy, with mass artillery used to pound Ukrainian positions and urban population centers, both to degrade their forces and weaken their resolve. A shortage of artillery would erode these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian artillery has played a crucial role in Russian defensive operations as well. Artillery was instrumental in helping stem the Kherson counteroffensive in late 2022. At the same time, defensive use of artillery has been able to inflict “frightful losses” on Ukrainian forces during recent counteroffensives in Kharkiv and Kherson. When used defensively, Russia’s approach is to bring mass firepower to bear to break up Ukrainian troop concentrations, disrupt attacks, interdict supply chains, and attrite their forces. However, defensive use of artillery consumes large amounts of ammunition. Acute ammunition shortages would thus weaken Russian defensive capabilities, opening up additional opportunities for Ukrainian counteroffensives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery has also been critically important for Russian offensive operations. Russia has been using mass fires, for example, to support the grinding, methodical advances taking place at Bakhmut. In this case, Russian forces are using artillery to keep Ukrainian forces in place, prevent them from concentrating, destroy strong points, and deliver suppressing fires during Russian ground assaults. In the Donbas, Russian artillery inflicted thousands of casualties, while at times creating a paralyzing effect on Ukrainian forces. In the process, however, Russian artillery units are using enormous amounts of ammunition. Growing ammunition shortages would thus further weaken Russia’s ability to conduct offensive operations as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Defensive use of artillery consumes large amounts of ammunition. Acute ammunition shortages would thus weaken Russian defensive capabilities, opening up additional opportunities for Ukrainian counteroffensives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this problem, Russia is attempting to make greater use of precision artillery, which is far more efficient than unguided shells. Being properly supported with quality targeting data and reconnaissance strike complexes designed to link sensors with fires through battlespace networks would help Russia enormously to conserve artillery ammunition, while also reducing its logistical footprint. To date, however, Russian forces have faced challenges in scaling up the use of precision artillery due to poor training; limited intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities; and, most importantly, insufficient precision munition stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uncrewed-aerial-vehicles&quot;&gt;Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHANGES IN FORCE POSTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia was a latecomer in adopting UAVs, but over the last 15 years, it has made a concerted effort to catch up, developing a series of ISR and combat drones, and loitering munitions. According to the Kremlin, Russia entered the war with approximately 2,000 military drones of various kinds, distributed across the different services. These included hundreds of Orlan-10 ISR UAVs; Orion combat drones; Lancet-3 and KUB-BLA loitering munitions; and special purpose drones, such as the Leer-3, which is designed to hijack and disrupt cellular phone traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although exact numbers are hard to come by, since the war began, Russia has likely lost hundreds of UAVs to Ukrainian air defense, electronic attack, system failure, and pilot error. To replenish its stocks, Russia’s defense industry has promised to ramp up production of ISR drones, combat drones, and loitering munitions. To this end, Putin recently announced a new national import substitution program for the development of UAVs in Russia with up to 1 trillion rubles in new funding. However, the defense industry is grappling with supply chain issues due to shortages of navigation, radio communication, avionics, and information technology (IT) components, as well as capacity problems. Although there is evidence of some improvement, the industry is still having difficulty producing enough drones to meet demand. For example, production of Orion UAVs was recently estimated at a mere 45 units per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions are also contributing to Russia’s production problems. Russia’s Orlan-10 and Lancet UAVs rely on Western components — including cameras, engines, and electronics — some of which are placed on the sanctions list. Likewise, production of Russia’s Orion, which is comparable to Turkey’s Bayrakter, remains restricted due to sanctions and capacity limitations, while Moscow’s use of the Forpost-R combat drone in Ukraine has thus far been negligible. Russian officials recently announced a new program to shift over more fully to import substitution, but this is unlikely to lead to major increases in output over the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to such issues, Russian forces in Ukraine faced a serious drone shortage several months into the war. To compensate, Russia has been purchasing commercial UAVs made by Chinese companies, such as Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI), through online retailers and other channels. Chinese DJI quadcopters, designed for civilian use, have become particularly prevalent on the battlefield after repurposing for military use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Russian military is seeking to acquire a large number of “first-person view” (FPV) drones from China (or components to build them) for use as small, high-speed kamikaze drones. These are already being used by the AFU to good effect in Ukraine. Russia is also turning to Iran for UAVs, including the Mojaher-6 combat drone. Evidence also suggests that Moscow has been able to increase production for certain systems, such as the Lancet-3, based on a sharp increase in attacks in Ukraine since November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, Russian drone supplies have been sufficient to sustain a reasonably high tempo of drone operations despite persistent gaps in coverage due to the sheer size of the battlespace. Collectively, however, high UAV loss rates due to Ukrainian air defense and EW are driving Russia to import large numbers of foreign UAVs to replenish its stocks. Given domestic production limitations, Moscow remains highly dependent on Chinese civilian drones. According to Russian customs data, China has sold more than $12 million in drones and drone parts to Russia since the start of the war, although that likely understates actual volumes by a significant margin, given the prevalence of private drone purchases by Russian civilian volunteer groups. If Russia’s access to Chinese drones were to diminish due to sanctions, or if Russian drone losses significantly increased due to the AFU’s rising counter-UAV capabilities, growing shortages would start to erode the many advantages accruing for Russian forces from concentrated use of UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If Russia’s access to Chinese drones were to diminish due to sanctions, or if Russian drone losses significantly increased due to the AFU’s rising counter-UAV capabilities, growing shortages would start to erode the many advantages accruing for Russian forces from concentrated use of UAVs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPERATIONAL IMPACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveillance drones have been critical for Russia in maintaining battlespace awareness in Ukraine. ISR drones, such as Orlan-10, are serving effectively as forward-based artillery spotters, relaying data on Ukrainian positions to waiting Russian artillery batteries. When used effectively, ISR drones have reportedly helped to compress the time between target detection and strike to just three to five minutes. They have also helped artillery units conserve ammunition by reducing the need for blind shelling. Disruption of Russia’s ISR drone supply would therefore diminish a key component of Russia’s artillery kill chain, further undermining Russia’s ability to sustain effective artillery fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iLZiA5d.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A critical power infrastructure burning after a Russian drone attack against Kyiv on December 19, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of Russian surveillance drones linked to artillery has restricted the AFU’s freedom of action across the battlespace. When used in combination with Russian combat drones and loitering munitions, their pervasive presence has compelled AFU ground force commanders at times to disperse their forces and conceal weapons and troop movements in tactically limiting or unsound ways. A reduction in Russian drone supply would help loosen these strictures, allowing Ukrainian forces to concentrate their efforts more effectively while potentially restoring the element of surprise at selected points of attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s small fleet of combat drones and loitering munitions is also providing its forces with additional strike capability. Russian Lancet and KUB loitering munitions are able to hold Ukrainian targets at risk across the battlefront to a depth of up to 40 kilometers. They can effectively penetrate Ukrainian airspace and operate in AFU rear areas to conduct ground strikes and aerial interdiction while Russian combat aircraft remain largely sidelined due to Ukraine’s potent air defense network. A decline in Russian drone supplies would likewise hinder such operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian drone operations in Ukraine are also limited by deficiencies in UAV capabilities. For one, Chinese civilian drones suffer from limited range and durability. They remain vulnerable to jamming and spoofing as well, reducing their utility and survivability. Russian drone operations have also been hindered by persistent shortages of Russia’s Orion combat drone, which has sufficient range, payload capacity, and endurance to strike targets at operational depth. Having more of these platforms would help Russian forces further degrade Ukraine’s air defense networks, precision artillery, and logistics nodes in AFU rear areas — though these drones are themselves vulnerable to Ukrainian EW and air defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electronic-warfare&quot;&gt;Electronic Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHANGES IN FORCE POSTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian military has invested heavily in electronic warfare in an effort to maximize its control of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) on the battlefield. Building upon its impressive Soviet legacy in “radio-electronic battle,” Russia has developed a wide array of sophisticated EW systems in recent years. These include jammers and spoofers, electronic intelligence, advanced radars, electro-optical and infrared sensors, direction finders, and electronic countermeasures of various kinds. Russia has used EW to good effect in Ukraine to disrupt navigation signals and cellular communications, down drones, jam radars, and disrupt AFU operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although data on current inventory levels of Russian EW platforms are difficult to obtain, Russia has been able to maintain a sufficient number of EW assets to pervasively impact the EMS across broad areas of the battlefront, albeit with some limitations. Russia has also been able, at times, to mass its EW assets with paralyzing effect to support offensive ground operations. In May 2022, after the campaign shifted to the Donbas, Russia reportedly deployed around 10 EW complexes for every 20 kilometers of frontage. Collectively, these assets were used to disrupt navigation along the entire front, geolocate Ukrainian artillery, and conduct effective electronic attacks against Ukrainian aircraft and UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces in Ukraine have lost a significant number of EW platforms, however, including several dozen platforms dedicated to jamming and spoofing, electronic intelligence, aerial surveillance, target designation, direction finding, fire control, reconnaissance, and counter-unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). Faced with such losses, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu met with defense industry leaders recently to increase the production of EW equipment used in Ukraine. Russia’s Rostec also announced recently that it will begin mass production of a new generation of EW and counter-UAS platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, however, such efforts are likely to be increasingly challenged by sanctions on Western advanced microchips used in Russian EW systems. According to a recent report from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), Russia’s Borisoglebsk-2, an advanced broadband jammer, relies on a range of chips produced by Western companies, which it uses to process signals over a wide frequency range. Analysts also found Western chips in a Russian Torn-MDM signals intelligence (SIGINT) radio direction finder and a Fara radar system recently captured in Ukraine. Russian EW platforms are particularly dependent on specialized Western microchips, for which there are fewer external sources, so this is an area where sanctions are likely to be more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are significant gaps in Russian EW coverage, due to low production rates of certain EW platforms. Thus, in some areas, Russia simply does not have enough EW systems to cover the entire battlefront in Ukraine. This has left gaps in coverage in Russia’s air defense network, which Ukrainian forces have exploited, using drones to strike Russian ground forces or to cue artillery strikes. EW fratricide has also been a persistent problem, with Russian EW systems often jamming their own sensors and networks, forcing them to be taken offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russian EW platforms are particularly dependent on specialized Western microchips, for which there are fewer external sources, so this is an area where sanctions are likely to be more effective.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, Russian EW platforms also suffer from limited reach since their effects are often restricted to their line of sight. At the same time, Russia does not have enough long-range drones (such as Orion) capable of hosting onboard EW systems to extend their reach. This, in turn, is curbing Russia’s ability to penetrate Ukrainian airspace at sufficient depth to jam air defense radars, collect intelligence, and disrupt communications networks at the tactical-operational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPERATIONAL IMPACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these shortcomings, Russian forces have thus far been able to maintain sufficient EW platforms to create pervasive effects, at times, across broad areas of the battlefront. Russian forces are using EW to degrade Ukraine’s communications, navigation, and ISR capabilities and to repeatedly deny Ukrainian forces access to significant portions of the EMS. Moreover, despite sanctions, Russia’s EW capabilities have continued to advance, as its defense industry is finding new ways to achieve greater effects on the battlefield. For example, Russian EW systems were reportedly modified recently to take down Ukrainian DJI drones that were previously less susceptible to Russian electronic attack. Russia has also refined the use of its EW systems, allowing them to jam Ukrainian military communications without affecting its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Moscow’s growing supply chain problems and increasing losses on the battlefield, coupled with more effective Ukrainian countermeasures, are helping to perpetuate persistent EW shortages. Should this trend continue, this could materially erode Russia’s ability to maintain tactically significant EW effects, thereby leaving Russian forces more vulnerable to Ukrainian strikes. As this unfolds, it would create further gaps in coverage and new opportunities for Ukraine to deploy its drone force into Russian-controlled airspace and to expand precision strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, Russia has been using its EW and air defense systems to effectively counter Ukraine’s UAV fleet, thereby reducing its situational awareness and disrupting kill chains. Russian EW, when combined with air defense, has been highly effective at this mission, reportedly eliminating up to 90 percent of Ukrainian drones after just a few flights. Russia has also been using EW systems, such as Palantin, to jam Ukrainian drones and prevent them from transmitting the coordinates of Russian ground targets to Ukrainian artillery. Other EW assets are being used to dazzle UAV sensors and disrupt flight control transmissions from their remote operators. The lack of quality target data from ISR drones has, at times, effectively sidelined Ukrainian precision strike weapons. Dense EW and air defense networks have likewise been effective in countering Ukrainian combat drones and loitering munitions. Although targeting data provided by Western intelligence sources has likely helped offset such effects, suppression of Russian EW platforms would allow Ukrainian UAVs to operate more freely in what is currently denied airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y82uI7h.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A Russian drone-detecting radar station spotted at the Russian military base in Syria in September 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian EW assets are also playing a key role in Russian air defense networks, effectively limiting the role of Ukrainian ground attack aircraft by helping deny them access to airspace over Russian-controlled territories. Russia’s radio-technical forces have successfully maintained dense air defense radar coverage over the entire battlefront to facilitate surface-to-air missile strikes. Russian radar operators have also used EW to counter Ukrainian efforts to suppress these radars. Russian EW systems are also used routinely to jam airborne radars on Ukrainian combat aircraft and to disrupt their navigation and communications signals, to some effect, at times disabling them. Likewise, systems such as Russia’s Krasukha-4 are being utilized in an attempt to jam Western airborne and satellite-based radar signals and to disrupt communications. Suppressing these Russian EW assets would contribute significantly to efforts in hampering Russia’s air defense networks, providing more opportunities for the Ukrainian air force to access airspace over Russian-occupied territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;long-range-precision-strike&quot;&gt;Long-Range Precision Strike&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHANGES IN FORCE POSTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s long-range precision strike systems, especially its best frontline theater cruise and ballistic missiles (Kalibr, Kh-101, and Iskander), have played a major role since the 2022 invasion. These systems have been used extensively throughout the campaign to strike high-value civilian and military targets in Ukraine at operational and strategic depth. At the start of the campaign, Russia relied primarily on the Kalibr, Kh-101, and Iskander missiles, which were expressly designed for the theater land attack mission, though it later incorporated other missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the sizes of Russia’s initial and current missile stockpiles remain unknown, Russia has reportedly launched several hundred of their best frontline missiles since the war began, and more than 5,000 missiles in total, as of April 2023. Missiles are typically employed using mass salvo attacks to stress Ukraine’s air defense network and ensure that a larger percentage of them reach their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, the rates of fire associated with Russia’s best frontline precision missiles have declined significantly. Accordingly, the Russians have likely been using their Kalibr, Kh-101, and Iskander missiles at faster rates than they can produce them, and this has significantly depleted their stockpiles over time. Estimates vary, but according to Ukraine’s defense minister, by November 2022, Russia had used 24 percent of its high-precision missiles, including 37 percent of its Kalibrs and 50 percent of its Kh-101 missiles — though the research team has been unable to confirm these numbers. The growing effectiveness of Ukrainian air defense systems is also taking an increasing toll on Russia’s missile stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As its theater missile campaign has continued, Moscow has been integrating other missiles into its long-range strike packages. These include the Russian Oniks, S-300, Tornado-S, Kh-55, and Kh-32 missiles, among others. However, many of these missiles were designed for other missions and were essentially repurposed for the theater land attack mission. More recently, Russia has been purchasing Iranian Shahed-136 one-way attack (OWA) drones, which have also been integrated into its long-range strike packages. At a price of as little as $20,000 per system, the Shahed-136 provides Russia a low-cost option to bolster its theater strike capability. Russia is reportedly acquiring another 6,000 of these systems, potentially for licensed production. Most recently, Moscow has renewed use of the Kh-47 Kinzhal hypersonic missile, which had been used sparingly earlier in the war. In this case, however, the Kinzhal represents an upgrade in capability based on its hypersonic speeds and its superior ability to penetrate Ukrainian air defense systems. This system is not invulnerable, however, as demonstrated by the recent downing of a Kinzhal missile by the Ukrainian Air Force using a Patriot air defense system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with this, the defense ministry has been making efforts to increase production, with Russia’s missile manufacturers working three shifts per day. In May 2022, Votkinsk — manufacturer of the Iskander missile — announced plans to hire 500 workers to increase production. It is unclear as of yet whether production volumes are increasing, but Russia has had some success in sustaining production in spite of sanctions. For example, a recent inspection of Kh-101 missiles recovered in Ukraine found that they contained Western microchips that were produced during the previous two months, indicating that the missiles themselves were also assembled within this two-month period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/p9hbRoe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, visited the Raduga missile manufacturer near Moscow on February 2, 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to boost production could increasingly be hindered by sanctions, however, given that production of these advanced missiles relies extensively on Western electronics. Sanctions are also liable to limit Russia’s ability to add capacity, which is dependent on advanced Western machine tools. Production of Kalibr missiles was reportedly halted temporarily due to a breakdown in Western manufacturing equipment used in its production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPERATIONAL IMPACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift to a broader mix of precision strike weaponry has significantly helped to sustain the Kremlin’s long-range precision strike campaign. However, the growing use of missiles built for other missions, such as the S-300 air defense missile, has reduced the campaign’s effectiveness. Such missiles are not designed for the land attack mission and are poorly suited for it. Many lack the accuracy needed to hit their designated targets, with some missing them by a wide margin. Although they cause damage to whatever they hit, they are inevitably less effective in destroying critical infrastructure targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluctuations in operating tempo characterized by changes in the frequency and size of Russia’s strike packages have likewise impeded the theater missile campaign, resulting in a reduced operating tempo on occasion, giving Ukraine more time to recover. Moreover, the growing share of lower quality missiles in recent strike packages is also reducing their effectiveness, due to their limited reach and ability to circumvent Ukrainian air defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key goals of Russia’s theater precision strike campaign is to support Russia’s ground campaign by destroying critical infrastructure targets directly supporting Ukraine’s war effort. This includes command and control nodes, defense plants, military training centers, air force bases, logistics depots, and similar targets. Further reductions in the volume of Russian long-range missile strikes — due to sanctions or production problems — would limit Russia’s ability to carry out this mission. At the same time, using less accurate missiles against such targets is likely to lead to lower success rates and more civilian damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key goal of Russia’s theater strike campaign is to help degrade and eventually suppress Ukraine’s integrated air and missile defense systems. This is achieved both directly by striking Ukrainian air bases and air defense nodes and indirectly by compelling Ukraine to deplete its remaining inventory of surface-to-air missiles. Notably, the latter mission is far less dependent on Russia’s most capable precision strike missiles (e.g., Kh-101). If the goal is compelling Ukraine to expend its air defense missiles, virtually any missile with sufficient reach will suffice. The Iranian Shahed-136 UAVs have been used to good effect for this mission, causing Ukraine to expend its limited supply of expensive surface-to-air missiles to destroy drones purchased at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s theater strike campaign is also designed to impose costs on the Ukrainian populace, disrupt the economy, and shape leadership decisionmaking by striking (or holding at risk) critical civilian infrastructure targets throughout the country. Russian missile strikes against Ukrainian energy plants, oil refineries, and other civilian infrastructure have been a key component of this effort, raising costs on the entire populace. This mission is intended to undermine the economy, as well as the will of the Ukrainian people, while sending a message to them that there are no sanctuaries in the country. Unfortunately, for this purpose, use of less accurate missiles, such as the S-300, can still be quite effective since an errant missile strike in a residential area nevertheless contributes to the objective. A sustained reduction in the volume of Russian missile strikes would further impair Russia’s ability to carry out this mission, reducing the threat to Ukraine’s economy while helping contain the effects of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Kremlin’s theater strike campaign is also designed to impose costs on the Ukrainian populace, disrupt the economy, and shape leadership decisionmaking by striking (or holding at risk) critical civilian infrastructure targets throughout the country.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, Ukraine’s air defense network has been surprisingly effective at intercepting Russian long-range missiles. It is important to recognize, however, that it will be difficult to fully mitigate this threat given Russia’s ability to produce or acquire additional systems. Russia’s best missiles can maneuver, use decoys, and take other measures to avoid interception. Inevitably, a certain number of missiles are likely to get through. By the same token, using expensive surface-to-air missiles to intercept Iranian drones acquired at a fraction of the price is not a cost-effective tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-of-equipment-shortages-on-russias-ability-to-operate-in-other-areas&quot;&gt;Impact of Equipment Shortages on Russia’s Ability to Operate in Other Areas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section of the report assesses the impact of Russia’s cumulative equipment and munition shortages on its ability to carry out operations in other areas, even if the war in Ukraine is ongoing. This assessment is obviously preliminary in nature and limited to three potential conflict scenarios, including a potential intervention in Central Asia to restore stability, an expeditionary operation in the Middle East and North Africa, and a conventional military operation in the Caucasus, all of which take place in the next few years. The section concludes with a preliminary discussion on the prospects and timing for Russia to reconstitute its forces. All such assessments are, out of necessity, highly speculative and highly contingent on the circumstances at the time. Thus, the outcome could be quite different depending on the timing, the context, the stakes involved, the geopolitical conditions, and many other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stability-operations-in-central-asia&quot;&gt;Stability Operations in Central Asia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Russia is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a military alliance comprised of Russia and five former Soviet states: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. The CSTO is a true military alliance with mutual defense commitments. In January 2022, just prior to the Ukraine invasion, Kazakhstan’s president requested CSTO assistance after armed anti-government protesters took control of parts of Almaty, the country’s largest city. In response, a Russia-led force made up of 2,300 troops from Russia and other CSTO member states was quickly dispatched to Kazakhstan. This included over 1,000 Russian regulars and airborne troops, as well as several armored vehicles. Their mission was to provide security, guard key facilities, and free up Kazakh security forces, who were then able to quell the protests and restore order. The mission was completed within a week and Russian forces were then withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Russian military should have little difficulty in carrying out a similar operation in Central Asia in the next few years, its losses in Ukraine notwithstanding. Given the small size of the mission, its limited scope, and the permissive environment, Russia retains the ability to carry out such operations whether or not the war in Ukraine is ongoing. It also retains the military airlift capability to transport and sustain a force of this size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expeditionary-operations-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa&quot;&gt;Expeditionary Operations in the Middle East and North Africa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In 2015, Russia dispatched an expeditionary force to Syria to support Syrian government forces facing a wide array of armed rebel groups which had been receiving substantial external support. The initial contingent of the Russian military in Syria reportedly comprised roughly 4,100 military personnel, including one to two squadrons of Russian combat aircraft, several ground force and artillery units, a naval contingent, and a military transport unit. Russian forces established a forward-operating base at Khmeimen in Syria and commenced air strikes. Russian specialists also provided advisory support and combat support services for the Syrian army. This mission was sustained for several years, during which the composition of the force changed considerably, but this assessment is restricted to the initial deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Despite recent losses in Ukraine, Russia’s armed forces likely still retain the capacity to carry out an expeditionary operation of similar scope and character in the Middle East and North Africa, so long as they have access to suitable basing and a port on the eastern Mediterranean. Russian operations in Syria were centered primarily on an air campaign and took place in a relatively permissive environment. Russian ground forces were assigned to protect Russian bases in Syria, though they also operated in the field to provide advisory support, as well as limited combat and combat support services, for the Syrian army. Despite recent losses in Ukraine, Russian ground forces likely still retain sufficient capacity to carry out such a mission given the limited requirements. Likewise, the Russian navy and aerospace forces also maintain the capacity to complete this kind of operation, since their losses in Ukraine remain limited relative to the ground forces. Russia also retains sufficient military airlift and naval transport capacity, which — together with access to commercial shipping — should be sufficient to sustain such an operation, provided Turkey reopens the Bosporus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conventional-military-operations-in-the-caucasus&quot;&gt;Conventional Military Operations in the Caucasus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In 2008, the Russian military carried out a brief but successful high-intensity conventional military operation against Georgia during the Russo-Georgian War. Operations were initially centered in South Ossetia (or the Tskhinvali region, as commonly called in Georgia) and Abkhazia, two breakaway provinces under Russian protection. Operations commenced with clashes between Russian and Georgian troops in South Ossetia, with the Georgian government seeking to reincorporate the two provinces into Georgia proper. Russia effectively crushed the Georgian armed forces in a five-day campaign, bringing overwhelming power to bear. To carry out the mission, Russia reportedly assembled a force of 25,000 combat troops backed by over 1,000 tanks and armored vehicles, artillery, rocket forces, and airpower. Although Russia prevailed in the war, it incurred significant casualties and equipment losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Russian military would be challenged to carry out a similar operation in the Caucasus without a high degree of risk, while the war in Ukraine is ongoing, given their high loss rates in the current conflict. Once the war is over, it would likely take a year or so before Russia could comfortably mount such an operation due to the need to restore its forces in light of the heavy tank and artillery losses and ammunition expenditures in Ukraine. Prior to this, such shortages could make it challenging for Russia to quickly assemble a ground force component capable of offensive operations comparable to the one it used in the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. Assessments of this kind are highly contingent, however. Unlike Ukraine, a conflict in the Caucasus would be less demanding given the small size of the countries in the region and their lack of strategic depth. Local militaries are also smaller and less well equipped. Thus, if vital interests were at stake, the Kremlin could probably assemble such a force, provided it had sufficient time to mobilize equipment and personnel beforehand. It would have to rely extensively, however, on reserve ground combat equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uO3WYCX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reconstituting-the-force&quot;&gt;Reconstituting the Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these limited contingencies, Russian forces would be hard-pressed to undertake another conventional military conflict on the scale of Ukraine over the next few years. Russian losses in Ukraine are simply too great for Russia to manage an operation of this scale until the Kremlin has made sufficient headway in restoring its losses. Russia will need time to reconstitute its forces, and most observers agree that it will take many years to rebuild its ground forces, especially if Western sanctions remain in effect. Much will depend on how effective Moscow is in mobilizing defense production and on what kind of force it decides to build. The degree to which it chooses to rely on its vast weapons stores will also affect the time it takes to restore capacity. If Russia decides to try to build a more advanced force than the one it fielded in Ukraine, this would extend the total time needed to reconstitute its forces. If sanctions take hold more effectively, then Russia may also need technical assistance from China and other countries still willing to do business with it. As long as Russia maintains sufficient energy revenues to fund such activities, it is likely to find partners willing to share weapons and technology. Otherwise, it will have to rely more fully on import substitution — a challenging proposition given the state of Russia’s technology base. Most observers agree, however, that Russia will eventually succeed in rebuilding its military, with estimates of 5–10 years according to recent testimony from U.S. intelligence officials. Russian production rates during the most recent state armament programs provide some guidance on the defense industry’s production potential. For example, according to the Swedish Defense Research Agency, Russia was able to modernize around 185 main battle tanks per year between 2011 and 2018 and, as noted above, manufacturing has reportedly increased to around 250 tanks per year. But these figures do not take account of recent Russian efforts to expand capacity and ramp up production, which may eventually result in higher production rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings-and-conclusions&quot;&gt;Key Findings and Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war in Ukraine, the United States and its allies have made a concerted effort to support Ukraine through the provision of military assistance and the imposition of sanctions on Russia. Military assistance is centered on the provision of military equipment and intelligence sharing on Russian force dispositions. It has had the most immediate and visible effect, affording Ukraine the means to rapidly upgrade its own military and to vigorously contest Russian forces, resulting in heavy attrition of Russian military capabilities and extraordinarily high equipment losses. Sanctions have also had an immediate impact on Russian defense production by abruptly severing supply linkages with Russia, though their direct effects are harder to discern. Yet, there are numerous indications that sanctions are placing Russia’s defense industry under duress and making it harder to overcome capacity limitations. Numerous Russian media reports cite the need to increase import substitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attrition of Russian forces has substantially depleted equipment inventories, which in turn has undermined Russia’s ability to prosecute the war in Ukraine. Resulting equipment and munition shortages are eroding Russian forces’ fire superiority, limiting their ability to maneuver, and undercutting capabilities in other areas. Collectively, this is creating a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces to renew their counteroffensive, though it is not yet clear how long the situation will last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is responding on both fronts, seeking to limit further attrition and to circumvent sanctions. Where possible, Russian military leaders have been reducing the tempo of operations in Ukraine, pulling back to more defensible positions, adjusting their tactics, and limiting munition consumption. Likewise, Russian defense leaders are taking extraordinary measures to ramp up defense production and replenish their forces. Due to the sanctions, this includes drawing Soviet-era equipment out of storage and sourcing drones from China and Iran. In essence, there are two separate attrition battles underway, both bitterly waged between Russia on the one hand, and Ukraine and its Western allies on the other. They include the war of attrition on the ground in Ukraine to decisively attrite Russian forces, and the global sanctions campaign to suppress Russian budget revenues and defense production. The results of these two contests could well decide the war, but the outcome still very much hangs in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the restricted nature of the data in question, the assessments in this report have had to rely, at times, on circumstantial or incomplete evidence. Nonetheless, this report draws several conclusions about the impacts of attrition and sanctions on Russia’s ability to prosecute the war in Ukraine and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-to-date-us-and-allied-support-for-ukraine-aimed-at-increasing-attrition-rates-have-been-very-effective-resulting-in-substantial-reductions-in-the-quality-of-russian-forces&quot;&gt;1. To date, U.S. and allied support for Ukraine aimed at increasing attrition rates have been very effective, resulting in substantial reductions in the quality of Russian forces.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attrition has taken a heavy toll on Russian forces in Ukraine, undermining their capabilities across the board. The impact on Russia’s offensive capabilities has been greater, however, than it has on its defensive capabilities. Moreover, the effects of attrition have impacted some weapons categories more than others, since Russia has been more successful in some areas in finding ways to resupply its forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attrition has taken a heavy toll on Russia’s tank forces, which have lost two-thirds of their frontline MBTs. Replacing them with Soviet-era models pulled from storage has partially offset such losses, but it has also reduced the quality of the tank force and significantly limited Russia’s ability to maneuver. Yet Russia’s maneuvering problems are not solely a function of the size and quality of its tank force. They are linked, as well, to deficiencies in personnel, lack of training and morale, poor planning and execution, limited leadership, deficiencies in combined arms operations, and other factors. Over time, these issues can potentially be rectified. Moreover, Russia still has thousands of tanks in storage that it could draw upon, although most of the remaining systems will likely require more extensive refurbishment before they can be placed in service. Moreover, Russia also has the potential to increase production, so it should gradually be able to replenish its forces, although it will take several years to fully reconstitute its prewar tank fleet. Thus, Russia’s potential to restore its armored maneuver capabilities should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waging a high-intensity war of attrition has taken a toll on Russa’s artillery units amid growing signs of depletion of their ammunition stockpiles. The latter is emerging as a major problem for Russian forces in Ukraine, which rely heavily on mass firepower to sustain operations, offset their deficiencies, and contain Ukrainian counteroffensives. Russia is drawing deeply on its munition reserves while its leaders are scrambling to obtain munitions from other countries. But it is not yet clear whether these actions will be sufficient to avert a serious crisis. The defense industry is also pushing to expand production of artillery and MLRS munitions but is facing capacity limitations. Over time, however, Russia is likely to increase production sufficiently to maintain a reduced though more sustainable rate of fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Russia has been able to maintain a relatively high tempo of drone operations despite significant UAV losses during the war, yet shortages persist. It has managed to do so by boosting production rates for some frontline drones, such as the Orlan-10 and Lancet, and even more so by importing UAVs in large numbers from other countries. The purchase of small Chinese civilian drones, including DJI quadcopters, has been particularly important for sustaining drone operations, while Iranian drones are filling gaps in other areas. However, Russia’s growing dependency on foreign sources remains a vulnerability due to the threat of sanctions and, to a lesser extent, the potential for reduced access to Chinese civilian drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also managed to maintain a sufficient number of EW platforms to sustain operations, despite incurring significant losses in Ukraine. Data regarding their initial and remaining stockpiles and relevant production rates are harder to come by, limiting visibility in this area. Yet there are reasons to believe that EW may be an area of vulnerability for Russia, given their high dependence on specialized Western microchips. Moreover, maintaining and replenishing such a diverse array of EW platforms is likely to present logistical challenges. Given their importance for Russian operations in Ukraine, more research is needed in this area to target Russian EW systems more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, Moscow has demonstrated an ability to sustain its theater strike capabilities despite heavy expenditures of its best frontline missiles (Kalibr, Kh-101, and Iskander). This has led to a decline in the use of these particular systems, though the Kremlin may be holding some in reserve for other contingencies. By shifting to a more diversified mix of theater missiles, hypersonic weapons, and OWA drones, the Kremlin has been able to sustain operations in this area, but at a cost of reduced quality and performance. Russia will face challenges in increasing production of new missiles due to sanctions and capacity limitations. But over the near term at least, it is likely to maintain enough missiles to sustain operations, even if at decreased frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-attrition-could-be-even-more-effective-if-carefully-tailored-to-the-situation-though-there-are-limits-to-this-approach&quot;&gt;2. Attrition could be even more effective if carefully tailored to the situation, though there are limits to this approach.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of attrition on Russian weapons and munition stockpiles varies considerably across weapons categories. For instance, Russian tank losses significantly exceed artillery losses on an absolute basis. Likewise, Russia’s ability to replace its losses also varies across the various weapons categories. Although drone losses are high, Russia’s ability to obtain replacements has been good enough to sustain a relatively high tempo of operations. By the same token, the impact on Russian military operations in Ukraine depends on the extent of the resulting equipment and munition shortages. Thus, the effects of attrition on Russian weapons inventories — and hence, Russian operational capabilities — remain uneven, affecting some capabilities more than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, it is important to recognize that Russian operational capabilities in Ukraine — with some exception — require integrated use of all the various weapon categories covered in this report. For example, maintaining fire superiority over Ukraine relies on a combination of systems. It relies not only on substantial amounts of artillery and ammunition, but also on adequate UAV coverage to obtain targeting data. It also depends on having sufficient EW and air defense assets for counter-UAS operations to prevent Russian artillery platforms from being targeted by counterbattery fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, not every Russian weapons category is equally important in terms of sustaining the war effort. In the case of Ukraine, Russian artillery is paramount since it plays a central role in Russian operations. Since the conflict has devolved into a war of attrition, artillery has become the center of gravity for Russian forces in Ukraine. Thus, suppressing Russian artillery fires (even if only locally), is of central importance for Ukraine, both for escaping the cycle of attrition and for providing opportunities to maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers can potentially use such information to refine their strategy by focusing military assistance and sanctions in areas where they are most likely to achieve operational and strategic effects. As an example, focusing on measures to degrade Russian artillery capabilities has the potential to significantly undermine Russia’s ability to use mass fires to blunt Ukrainian counter-offensives. This could be done by reducing Moscow’s ability to obtain battlefield surveillance drones for target acquisition, by curtailing artillery ammunition shipments from foreign suppliers, and by improving Ukraine’s counter-battery fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Since the conflict has devolved into a war of attrition, artillery has become the center of gravity for Russian forces in Ukraine. Thus, suppressing Russian artillery fires (even if only locally), is of central importance for Ukraine, both for escaping the cycle of attrition and for providing opportunities to maneuver.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The heavy attrition of Russian forces has substantially depleted their capabilities, creating a window of opportunity for Ukraine to renew its counteroffensive. However, it is unclear how long the window will remain open before Russia is able to replenish its forces sufficiently to shore up its defenses.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustained large-scale Western military assistance has significantly strengthened the AFU’s capabilities. As a result, the balance of forces in the war has shifted over time in ways favorable to Ukraine. Most importantly, the AFU is rapidly approaching parity in terms of firepower, and it has acquired certain advantages over Russia in terms of maneuverability. This is creating openings for Ukraine to seize the initiative and go on the offensive during the next phase of the war. But it is unclear how long this window of opportunity will last before Russian efforts to resupply and reconstitute its forces start to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;

Prolonged war in Ukraine, coupled with heavy personnel and equipment losses, will likely limit the Kremlin’s ability to conduct high-intensity conventional military operations at scale in other areas, at least over the near term.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, significant MBT and artillery losses incurred by Russia in Ukraine, as well as growing ammunition shortages, would make it increasingly challenging for Moscow to promptly deploy a well-equipped and sizeable ground force component — comparable to the one it used in the 2008 Russo-Georgian War — in other parts of the world. However, the Kremlin still likely retains enough capacity to conduct certain stability and expeditionary operations of limited duration, scale, and scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are multiple factors shaping the conflict in Ukraine — many of which are outside the control of Western policymakers — this report concludes by proposing several ideas for Western policymakers to consider in calibrating Western military assistance and sanctions to contribute further to the attrition of Russian forces in Ukraine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue to resupply Ukrainian forces with tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, and precision munitions at rates required to secure and maintain maneuver and firepower superiority over Russia and to set conditions to bring the war to a favorable conclusion as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider granting Ukrainian manufacturers rights to use selected Western technologies for licensed production of selected weapons systems, component parts, and/or ammunition needed to wage the ground war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focus Western military assistance on degrading Russian artillery to help break the cycle of attrition, including counterbattery radars, airborne ISR, and secure battlespace networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide platforms to suppress Russian EW and air defense systems to help Ukrainian drones and loitering munitions maneuver more freely in Russian-controlled airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boost Ukrainian counter-UAS capabilities with short-range air defense and EW to break Russia’s artillery kill chain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bolster Ukrainian air and missile defense networks to maintain area denial against Russian combat aircraft and to sustain high attrition rates on Russian long-range missiles and OWA drones, although this will take time and will require concerted effort to ramp up Western production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate sanctions loopholes allowing delivery of civilian drones to Russia for use in the Ukrainian conflict, particularly drones produced by China’s DJI, which Russia uses extensively, although this will admittedly be difficult given the multiple existing distribution channels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tighten export controls and enforcement activities to block transfers of high-end microchips used in Russian EW platforms, including through illicit channels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;何桂藍認同議員有權基於政治訴求否決財案 惟指不論內容否決「程序上講唔通」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（28日）踏入審訊第94天。何桂藍開始接受控方盤問，就岑敖暉於抗爭派記者會指若「暴政當道」，相信不論內容也會否決預算案，何認同立法會議員有權基於政治訴求否決財案，但認為岑說法有「謬誤」、「程序上講唔通」，因政府若回應五大訴求必在預算案反映。何舉例若撤回暴動定性，相信律政司就「洗少好多錢」；若重啟政改，當局進行全港性諮詢亦涉大量金錢。何又表明認為五大訴求中最重要是「雙普選」，因有了雙普選後其他事情可慢慢解決，並認為政府就政改「需要同全香港人一齊傾」。控方又引述抗爭派記者會上，梁晃維和岑敖暉談及否決財案時稱「我哋」等，指包括何桂藍，何回應不肯定梁所指，又形容是岑所相信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就何稱「攬炒」於2020年5月底已開始，何指是大部分2019年運動參與者的理解，不過在她眼中「攬炒」不是目標，而是「唔怕付出代價嘅心態」，故在其角度「攬炒冇話完唔完」。何亦確認，組織者從無給出新東會議共識等文件，亦不同意「李伯盧」撰文引戴耀廷稱協調於5月已完成，重申新東當時「有嘢未解決」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方引李伯盧文章問協調是否已於5月完成-何不同意&quot;&gt;控方引李伯盧文章問協調是否已於5月完成 何不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍昨完成8天主問，今開始接受主控萬德豪盤問。萬展示2020年5月11日由《立場新聞》發布、署名「李伯盧」的文章〈【初選聯署】立會有初選啦！但有無約束力？睇你簽唔簽名〉，何指當時不知誰是「李伯盧」。控方指何現在知道他是吳政亨，何說：「我唔知我係咪好留心咁聽晒（證供），我都唔知李伯盧係咪只係一個人定係一堆人咁樣嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/p4n9Ray.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 吳政亨（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文章提及「戴耀廷教授剛於訪問中透露直選協調進展……好消息當然是五區協調成功！」，萬問5月11日時協調是否已完成。何先指理解協調是揀選候選人參與正式選舉，只有在初選完結後才能完成；不過若是指初選機制的協調，何指就新東而言，並不同意5月11日時協調已完成，因當時就出選名單是「6」或「6+1」未有共識，自言對該問題「比較擔心」。但何亦認為，就何時投票、票站情況、「入唔到頭6名就唔選」等機制有共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李伯盧稱候選人同意簽會運用協議書-何我會問篇文嘅作者啲消息喺邊度嚟&quot;&gt;李伯盧稱候選人同意簽「會運用」協議書 何：我會問篇文嘅作者啲消息喺邊度嚟&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文章提及「所有參與會議的五區候選人都同意簽署協議書『會（積極）運用』基本法賦予權力，包括否決財政預算案」，何曾供稱第二次會議上就「會」或「會運用」未達共識。萬德豪問文中陳述是否錯誤？何說「我會問呢篇文嘅作者啲消息喺邊度嚟囉」，她亦不同意此陳述。何亦指，無印象讀過這篇文章，《立場》也無人向她提起或問及這篇文章，但相信當時《立場》有人知道她有意參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指出，與會者於第二次新東會議同意使用「會運用」字眼，何不同意。代表何的大律師 Trevor Beel 一度起身指，該說法與控方證人區諾軒的證供矛盾，惟陳慶偉指審訊經常出現不一致的情況，並非辯方站起反對的理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EoVkeP3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;單張指受壓迫者須將政權迫向鎮壓或讓步抉擇-何指不認為港府有主導局勢的權力&quot;&gt;單張指受壓迫者須將政權迫向鎮壓或讓步抉擇 何指不認為港府有主導局勢的權力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續就何桂藍選舉單張發問，問當中「極權」是否指中國和香港政府，何指「你可以咁理解」，惟萬指其理解不重要，重要的是何的理解，何續說「咁嚴格嚟講香港政府又未去到極權呢個程度嘅」。就「面對極權，受壓迫者必須用最大力量將政權迫向『鎮壓』抑或『讓步』的抉擇」，萬再問「政權」是否指中共和港府，何指「我唔認為香港政府有主導局勢嘅任何權力」，同意單張亦提到「中共控制嘅傀儡，港共政府」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何重申理解攬炒是心態非目標所以喺我嘅角度攬炒冇話完唔完&quot;&gt;何重申理解「攬炒」是心態非目標：所以喺我嘅角度，攬炒冇話完唔完&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何早前稱5月底《國安法》通過時「攬炒」已經發生，何今解釋是指大部分2019年運動參與者眼中的「攬炒」於5月已開始；但在何眼中，「攬炒唔係一個目標」，「係一種唔怕付出代價嘅心態，所以喺我嘅角度，攬炒冇話完唔完」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，何談及的「攬炒」似乎是「心態（state of mind）」多於「事態（state of affairs）」。何回應指她一直也說「攬炒」是一種精神，「就係認知到自己都要付好嚴厲嘅代價，都要向前嘅精神」，但2019年運動參與者提到的「攬炒」則屬於「事態」，而「攬炒」一詞自6月起也不太常用，何自己亦轉用「破局」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何不同意本地打壓或國際制裁會加劇攬炒知道不會有35故單張僅寫爭最多議席&quot;&gt;何不同意本地打壓或國際制裁會加劇「攬炒」、知道不會有35+故單張僅寫爭最多議席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問政權「鎮壓」會否加劇「攬炒」，何一度指將政權迫向鎮壓或讓步的抉擇，是討論八九十年代東歐民主化過程時常用的說法，至於在香港，若政權選擇不妥協，在立法會語境便是會進行「大規模DQ」，或選舉後再做傷害議會合法性的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指之所以說「攬炒」5月底已發生，除《國安法》外亦因美國取消香港特別待遇，形容已上升至「國際層面」，故認為香港本地「無論發生咩打壓，都好難同呢個層面嘅東西去比較㗎喇」，認為控方說法不太準確。萬續問，若有更多國際制裁，會否加劇「攬炒」，何認為不會，指相比取消特別待遇較「細囈」，「除非你玩到（港元與美元）脫鈎㗎啫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問「讓步」的意思，何指單張讀者是一些已關注香港政治超過一年的普通人，「我相信如果睇到『讓步』呢兩隻字，嗰啲人會好清楚我所指嘅係乜嘢」，像是「民主化」的訴求，而雙普選是其中一樣。至於單張提及「爭取立法會最多議席，力爭主導權」，何不同意是指立會過半，重申過半不等於取得主導權，而因她知道不會有35+，故沒有寫「35+」，只寫最多議席，但強調望選舉結果票數可令民主派在政治局勢取得主導權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱爭取重啟政改-政府需與全香港人一齊傾-而非爭取個人想要的制度&quot;&gt;何稱爭取重啟政改 政府需與全香港人一齊傾 而非爭取個人想要的制度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，何昨日稱在單張仍列出政綱是不想讓人誤會她的主張。惟李運騰指何應是指不想人誤會立法會可實現該些訴求。法官陳慶偉遂下令休庭，讓控方翻查相關錄音，小休時法庭書記播放昨日錄音，控方團隊上前聆聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;午休後控方播出相關部分，何提及列出政綱可讓選民看到其本身主張，但也不會誤會她參選是承諾可幫他們爭取。萬續指，何所指迫政權做抉擇的方式，就是透過取得35+後否決預算案？陳慶偉打斷問，如這就是控方的問題，那剛才為何要翻聽錄音？林卓廷發笑，萬解釋因他剛才的說法完全不準確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在法官追問下同意，認為現行立法會制度無法落實倡議，而她望能「破局」，破除政府設定的限制。陳慶偉追問，而其中一個破局的方法是否決預算案，迫政府談判或建立何同意的制度（acceptable to you）？何重申不認為否決財案可直接迫政府回應，而她要求政府回應，亦不是為一個她本人想要的制度，解釋爭取民主化時，「無論呢度47個人定係每一個參與運動嘅人」，對民主化甚至雙普選的想像也不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「所以唔係話爭取到雙普選、然後佢落實雙普選，就完咗喇件事」，強調重啟政改一定是一個全香港一同參與的討論過程，無論公眾諮詢或其他方式，「所以我哋唔係話直接爭取一個既定嘅普選嘅制度，而係爭取重啟政改呢件事。只要嗰個政改嘅過程係民主嘅話，個結局、真正嗰個普選制度係點樣，可能未必係我而家想要嘅，但我哋至少要啟動呢個全香港人一齊傾嘅過程。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，否決預算案是迫使政府與何討論的方式？何說「同我傾係冇用嘅」，萬再問是與抗爭派傾？何回應：「立法會唔係講緊選35個人入中聯辦或者同林鄭傾，政府亦都冇可能喺成場運動幾百萬人入面搵啲領袖傾完，啲領袖就會返去說服啲支持者，唔係咁嘅一回事」，何強調，「佢要傾，佢需要同全香港人一齊傾」，而到時他們這些所謂民主派政治人物就會以香港人身分或政黨、政治組織的身分參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑何桂藍無於論壇提35不可能-何不同意&quot;&gt;控方質疑何桂藍無於論壇提35+不可能 何不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何早前亦稱，曾於初選論壇提及35+是不可能。控方質疑其說法，並逐一展示何於論壇上的發言段落確認。何主動打斷：「其實你想問返我邊度講不可能呀嘛？」，並指其中一段提及「正如可能頭先 Ventus 所講喇，可能好多嘅朋友就喺度問緊，到底35+有冇成功嘅機會呢？」，指劉頴匡此前曾頗詳細講解為何35+不可能，她這句是表達同意，但沒有再闡釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0WLZ3zg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 劉頴匡（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬質疑該句是一個問題，何不同意，指如從片段看到其語氣，其意思會非常明顯，而她接續亦轉入35-的討論。萬再指，何從來沒有在論壇說過35+不可能，何答：「『35+是不可能的』呢9隻字就冇喇。」控方其後轉問其他議題，何主動問：「真係唔使睇返劉頴匡講嘅嘢咩？」萬指如何桂藍想便這樣做，也可留待覆問，何續說「OK，你繼續啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指梁晃維及岑敖暉抗爭派記者會提我哋包括何桂藍等出席者&quot;&gt;控方指梁晃維及岑敖暉抗爭派記者會提「我哋」包括何桂藍等出席者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問及抗爭派記者會，就梁晃維指一旦進入立法會，「無論我哋係對政府嘅提案定係財政預算案去投下反對票，呢一個都係我哋作為代議士嘅一個合法權利……我哋亦都繼續提倡議會攬炒嘅路線」，萬指梁用「我哋」並非談及個人看法，而是所有人，何指不肯定梁提及「我哋」是指什麼。萬再指，但一般人會認為梁是談及召開記者會的人的看法，而何桂藍也是這個「我哋」的一部分，何指「都可以咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NXFEQi0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 梁晃維（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於被問及抗爭派會否按承諾否決財案，岑敖暉稱「我相信呢一度全部（人）都係好堅定……如果我哋能進入議會嘅話，我哋係會好堅定行使基本法賦予畀代議士嘅權力，所以答案係『是嘅』」，控方指岑說「呢一度全部」也包括何桂藍，何稱「呢個係岑生相信嘅」。陳慶偉指岑也有提及「咁我哋呢度16人嘅立場」，何指岑是談及簽確認書和反對《國安法》的立場，「呢一個係我哋喺會前傾過嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑稱不論內容均否決財案-何指有謬誤-因政府若回應五大訴求會反映在財案&quot;&gt;岑稱不論內容均否決財案 何指有謬誤 因政府若回應五大訴求會反映在財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦引岑敖暉其後稱，如香港已落實五大訴求、有真普選，「我相信我哋係會有磋商嘅空間」，但如仍是暴政當道、魔警橫行，「我相信我哋係無論咩內容，都係會否決呢一個財政預算案嘅」，指岑同樣用了「我哋」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TxaaBAw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 岑敖暉（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍先指認為岑的說法有「謬誤」，指「五大訴求必然會喺財政預算案度反映出嚟」。陳慶偉問像「撤回暴動定性」如何在財案反映，何說「首先，喺我坐喺度咁耐以嚟都冇人問我睇嘅五大訴求係咩，或者我同唔同意五大訴求嘅」，並指簡單而言，「我個人覺得其實其他嗰四個（訴求）都唔係最重要，最重要係有咗雙普選嗰樣嘢，因為有咗雙普選之後，其他嘅嘢都可以慢慢解決嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續引岑的說法，指如「魔警橫行」是「需要撥款買武器」，又指2020年時警方已比2019年前「買多咗好多武器」，過去數年每年都會增購武器。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又解釋五大訴求如何反映在預算案，就重啟政改，何指選舉事務處或政制及內地事務局必然要「攞出一大筆錢」，因「全港規模幾輪嘅公眾諮詢」需要非常多錢。何又指若撤回暴動定性，「我相信律政司就洗少好多錢㗎喇」，旁聽席發笑。何並指簡單來說，預算案內有一部分為「管制人員報告」，每個政策局提交預算時未必會列出全部支出，但會在該報告交代該年計劃。何續指，如政府要回應五大訴求，而相關政策局無在預算案寫出來，「咁你可以問佢係咪會走數喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指總括而言，「我認同香港嘅立法會議員係有權利基於一啲政治訴求否決財政預算案，但係話不論內容都會否決呢，喺呢個 context，程序上係講唔通嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱新東從無會議紀錄和共識文件理解參與初選為交表一刻&quot;&gt;何稱新東從無會議紀錄和共識文件、理解參與初選為交表一刻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何今早接受代表林卓廷的大律師沈士文盤問。就協調會議，何同意有3類人參選，包括可提供票站的人、有意參加初選的人、及沒有表明出選意願的人，而當時沒有討論與會者必須參加初選，及參加初選者必須出席協調會議。沈士文問，因此參與初選的決定性一刻（decisive moment），就是填寫提名表格並向民主動力提交？何答：「我作為一個參選人，我係咁理解嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續同意，就新東而言，組織者從沒有給出協調會議議程、會議紀錄、及會議共識的文件。至於林卓廷名單的黃凱盈、吳定霖、郭㙟豐，何指不認得，但應沒有出席協調會議，並記得會上有民主黨代表，但不肯定是哪次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱新東決定將會議共識附在提名表格惟最終無相關文件&quot;&gt;何稱新東決定將會議共識附在提名表格、惟最終無相關文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何重申出席首次會議前，認為會上達成的共識或協議都應公開，解釋只是擔心如2018年民主派初選一樣「啲權責唔清唔楚」。沈士文問她是希望參與者遵守達成的共識？何指更準確是萬一像2018年時出現爭拗，「公眾都有一個基礎去分辨發生緊咩事、誰是誰非。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續同意，首次會議有討論要否達成共同綱領，但不肯定是第一次或第二次會議決定將會議共識以書面形式附在提名表格，她亦有此期望。何理解因表格會公開，故公眾會知道達成了的共識，惟兩次會議後從無收過該份文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何同意，對其後6月9日記者會戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議感到驚訝，最終提名表格亦無附上共同綱領。何指當時注意到不同區有討論要自行附上共同綱領，但「具體有冇人真係做呢我就唔肯定喇」，但後來在法庭得悉九東等候選人有交。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱新東有嘢未解決-以為有第三次會議但沒有&quot;&gt;何稱新東「有嘢未解決」 以為有第三次會議但沒有&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何同意，新東第二次會議有事情未解決，而會上討論「會」或「會積極」運用基本法權力的條款時，「當時除咗兩個人之外，其他人都好明顯冇乜興趣再參與呢個討論」，亦因時間不夠而轉至下一議題。何又指，當時應無很具體討論、但以為會有第三次會議，因「有嘢未解決」，但最終沒有，組織者亦無告訴她原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落無悔」是否對戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議的回應，何表示「我唔認為係對組織者嘅回應嚟嘅」。至於「墨落」是否邀請同意該兩點聲明（即會運用立法會權力包括否決財案，及在支持度不足時表明停止選舉工程）的候選人簽署，何指「其實都冇乜 invitation 出現過，如果你見到（聲明），咁你有興趣就加入」，並指理解加名的人不是說是否同意該兩點，而是指他們「會唔會做呢兩件事情」，強調「呢兩個立場係我認為需要向選民交代嘅立場」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Sz9lIEK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
▲ 何桂藍（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱理解會上討論共同綱領是會公開&quot;&gt;何稱理解會上討論共同綱領是會公開&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後問，會上有沒有人表達如有協議應該公開。何指不肯定，但她本人沒有，稱「如果唔打算公開咁簽嚟做咩呀」。何並指印象中當時討論要否有共同綱領時，「就係討論緊一份會公開嘅嘢」，未必用「公開」字眼，但會用「要向選民交代」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問何是否因2018年的事不希望參與者「反口」，何指有無人反口「我哋真係控制唔到」，指當時不知道政府會「出咩招」，猜不到會否有人改變立場。何並重申認為2018年問題未必在是否反口，而是當時民主派選擇改變初選方向時，民眾無法知道他們的理據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉表示不明白，問假設政府採取一些措施，選民如何知道候選人是因此而改變政綱。何指認為無需假設，「我相信呢個就係《國安法》造成嘅情況」，指5月底《國安法》出現時，有呼聲指「唔好搞論壇、唔好簽嘢」，不過她個人不認為是反口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指戴耀廷稱毋須簽文件不符期望惟可理解&quot;&gt;何指戴耀廷稱毋須簽文件不符期望惟可理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，因此何知道戴耀廷為何在記者會稱毋須簽文件？何指她不知戴基於什麼考慮，亦不知戴與其他候選人有什麼討論，但的確與她一直期望不符；又指她只是基於對局勢理解可理解戴為何這樣做。陳續指，2020年的事與2018年無關，是關乎《國安法》，何不同意，指兩次共通點都是「協調期間突然出咗啲好大嘅轉變」，2018年就是一個「大家以為非常安全嘅人，突然有風聲話DQ佢囉」。沈士文表示完成盤問後，沒有其他被告盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（27日）踏入審訊第93天。何桂藍繼續作供，就初選後抗爭派於7月15日召記者會及發聲明，何指難說是誰發起，而她曾邀請陳志全出席但「食檸檬」，形容對方「唔願意同抗爭派企埋一齊」。何又指，當時流傳參選人確認書會加入支持《國安法》條款，惟她認為是「掩眼法」，令政府毋須回應初選61萬票數民意。何強調是否DQ從不取決於有否簽確認書，故記招望指出毋須拘泥此事，並望民主派不論是否簽署也團結一致。至於會上岑敖暉稱會否決預算案，何指事前無討論亦不知岑會這樣說，會上亦無發言人；而她本人無承諾過否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求，因不認為可直接迫使，不想助長兩者聯繫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就鄒家成曾於論壇提到每個代議士都應以任何手段癱瘓議會，何認為「癱瘓議會」一直是建制派說法，她不認同被人扭曲或批評時要跟別人語言去講，但如「癱瘓議會」是指「盡責審義」，「我認同每一個代議士都應該要咁做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指利用選舉為政權製造麻煩激發政治張力&quot;&gt;何指利用選舉為政權製造麻煩、激發政治張力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供，就她7月14日發布的初選出線感言，提及立會選舉的戰役不僅關乎立會過半，「而關乎我們如何利用選舉、利用議會，激發出更大的政治張力。」被問「政治張力」的意思，何指如果民主一方的力量對政權來說是用一些以前用的手法就可解決到，就很難促成任何改變，因此要想辦法「製造一啲佢未遇過、未解決到嘅麻煩出嚟」，並強調是對政權來說是「麻煩嘅嘢」，「但對我哋來講可能純粹係憑心咁（在立法會選舉）投一票咁解㗎啫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何指，選前尚有「DQ嗰條線」，而當時認為政權會評估民主派勝算來決定DQ多少人，「民主派呢一方嘅氣勢有幾強，對佢最後決定DQ幾多人係有好大嘅影響。」法官陳仲衡關注她提及「利用議會」是指進入議會後做的事，何指當時不知道多少人可進入議會，故無一個清晰計劃，但思路與她剛才說如何激發更大政治張力是類似。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指預測大規模dq-認有plan-b但認為入閘前指定無意義&quot;&gt;何指預測大規模DQ 認有Plan B但認為入閘前指定無意義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即將抗爭精神帶入議會？何指視乎李運騰指什麼精神。李指法庭比較關注何當時的想法，何續解釋當時預測「絕大部分嘅『Plan A』都會被 DQ」，亦預期非常多的「Plan B」也會因為他們反對《國安法》的立場而被DQ，「咁究竟係乜嘢人代表民主派出選，係一個好大嘅疑問。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，相信不被DQ的人知名度亦不會太高，但若仍有正式選舉、新東投票率高達七成，最尾一席也需要逾8萬票才能當選；而這些知名度不高的人若得到被DQ者的支持，也可能會被DQ。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指她最終有「Plan B」，李運騰問她有否「Plan C」？何指當時情況很混亂，到後期已有很多人報名參選，故她當時心態已是：「睇吓到時有咩人入到閘再去決定，因為喺入閘前，我去所謂指定一個『Plan B』其實已經冇意義。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何想說服市民展示意志重要-即使立法會面目全非亦非選民責任&quot;&gt;何想說服市民展示意志重要 即使立法會面目全非亦非選民責任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何帖文最後稱「仍有很多說服的工作要做」，她指是說服選民而非任何當權者，重申當時選民認為「最安全」或者「打壓會冇咁勁」的情況是「反抗嘅一方唔好展示咁多嘅實力」，很多人甚至擔心「我投你，係咪會令你畀人拉呢」，或認為「我投一啲立場上相對冇咁溫和嘅候選人，我係咪就會令個立法會反而少咗民主派呢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何強調想說服這些選民，「展示呢個意志仍然非常之重要，就算最後因為我哋展示咗呢個意志而令到立法會面目全非，呢個都唔係我哋嘅責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成論壇提每個代議士應癱瘓議會-官稱或可用共謀者原則&quot;&gt;鄒家成論壇提每個代議士應「癱瘓議會」 官稱或可用「共謀者原則」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就7月4日將軍澳的地區論壇，鄒家成的片段節錄曾提及認為入議會「打交」不止是他、而是每個參選的代議士也應做的事，又指就算有無《國安法》，每個代議士都應有心理準備「用任何手段，癱瘓每一個議會嘅進行」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指對其說話無印象。Beel 問到當時有人如說出何桂藍不同意的事，她是否可以表達不同意，何指不肯定節錄是論壇哪個部分，不肯定當時有無辦法回應。李運騰認為若只有一段發言，難以脫離背景（out of context）下指證（implicate）其他人，又指鄒家成作供時或會就此回應，現時看不到這句如何能指證其他人，不過陳慶偉即笑說：「Haha, possible.（有可能）」，並指該發言是7月1日後發生，「共謀者原則」或適用，Beel 回應這也是他的關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指若癱瘓議會指盡責審議-認同每個代議士均應這樣做&quot;&gt;何指若「癱瘓議會」指盡責審議 認同每個代議士均應這樣做&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指看過相關片段，何桂藍當時對鄒家成的發言並沒有反應，並指可問下一個議題。惟何主動說：「但如果個問題係我認唔認同呢句說話，我可以答喎」，何續指「癱瘓議會」一直以來都是建制派、中聯辦或建制媒體的說法，她不清楚鄒家成引用時是否建制派媒體的意思，但何本人「就唔太認同因為人哋點樣扭曲或者批評我哋，我哋就跟住嗰個語言用法去講嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「但係如果鄒先生當時係指緊建制派媒體嘅用法，which 我理解其實就係盡責審議、把握每一個提出質詢嘅機會，咁我認同每一個代議士都應該要咁做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指曾邀陳志全出席抗爭派記者會惟被拒陳不願與抗爭派企埋一齊&quot;&gt;何指曾邀陳志全出席抗爭派記者會惟被拒、陳不願與抗爭派「企埋一齊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就7月15日的抗爭派記者會，有16人包括何桂藍出席。被問記者會如何召開，何解釋初選結果公布後，基本上所有出線者電話「都畀記者炸爆㗎喇」，並指與其各自見記者，一些初選時已一起拉票的候選人就決定「走埋一齊」，「一次過見記者就大家都方便喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡指，但記者會只是由抗爭派出席。何回應，抗爭派與傳統民主派之間界線從來都是模糊，而當時「係有一啲人我哋邀請過但佢哋選擇唔嚟嘅，咁就係陳志全議員喇，因為食檸檬嗰個係我，佢唔願意同抗爭派企埋一齊」，陳志全被點名時微微皺眉，聽到最後一句時微笑，何並指陳無說明為何不願意出席。陳慶偉其後一度指陳志全有現身何桂藍的街站，何否認，辯方指現場或有陳志全的橫額，惟陳慶偉再指陳志全或沒有發言，但他應在場，何續說她當時身後也有李梓敬的橫額。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又指，「好難話邊一個去發起（記者會）」，形容選後見記者是一定會發生，「爭在你搵到幾多人一齊見」；而邀請誰出席是「邀請嘅人自己決定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/s0F31T6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指抗爭者記者會望調強確認書是掩眼法憂令政府毋須回應初選民意&quot;&gt;何指抗爭者記者會望調強確認書是「掩眼法」、憂令政府毋須回應初選民意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，就記者會一開始便讀出、同日各參與者於 Facebook 發布的「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」，是於開記者會前大家「早咗少少到然後一齊𢭃出嚟嘅」，何亦有參與，故很難具體說是誰寫；而聲明包含他們想傳達的訊息，即他們希望輿論關注的事情、想影響輿論的方向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聲明提及簽署確認書與否成為爭議，但「取消資格與否從來並非取決於有否簽署文件」。何指「確認書」是指正式選舉報名表格附上的確認書，解釋初選結果於7月13日公布後，相信最具新聞價值就是61萬的投票數字，但當時建制媒體很快就傳出新風聲，指當屆確認書會加入支持《國安法》的條款，故輿論焦點很快又轉（spin）為關注個別參選人會否簽確認書和被DQ。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「咁至少我，仲有一啲其他人當時嘅 concern 就係，咁政府咪唔使回應呢61萬民意囉？」故她當時理解記者會重點就是強調這是「掩眼法」，「D唔DQ從來都唔取決於嗰個候選人有冇簽確認書。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱期望民主陣營能團結簽署確認書立場-惟傳統民主派終無會面或回應&quot;&gt;何稱期望民主陣營能團結簽署確認書立場 惟傳統民主派終無會面或回應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問即達成了什麼共識，何引述聲明一段：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;我們一眾抗爭派在此聲明，無論確認書最終會否加入與國安法有關內容，我們均義無反顧的反對國安法。就著未來有關文件簽署的取態，我們將會約見泛民初選人作磋商，期望整個民主陣營能團結一致，毋負選民期望。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何表示聲明首句提及會公開講明反對《國安法》，可形容為「共識」；而就是否簽署確認書，他們希望整個民主派達致一個一致的立場，「即係假設大家想簽就一齊簽，如果大家都OK唔簽就一齊唔好簽，佢真係要攞呢個藉口嚟DQ嘅話就DQ晒全部人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就聲明提及「就著未來有關文件簽署的取態，我們將會約見泛民初選人作磋商，期望整個民主陣營能團結一致，毋負選民期望」，何解釋他們當時算是公開邀請傳統民主派「可唔可以坐低一齊傾」有關簽署確認書的決定，並期望民主陣營能團結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何笑言印象中最終沒有舉行任何會面、沒有收到傳統民主派的回應，確認書亦沒有包含支持《國安法》的條款。惟何指當時輿論仍很執着於此事，「基本上每日都會問一次你會唔會簽確認書」，強調當時記者會意思是大家無需拘泥在此事上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱無承諾過否決財案迫政府回應五大訴求-不想助長兩者聯繫&quot;&gt;何稱無承諾過否決財案迫政府回應五大訴求 不想助長兩者聯繫&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就會上記者問及是否會按之前承諾，否決財案迫政府回應五大訴求，岑敖暉回應「我相信我哋係無論咩內容，都係會否決財政預算案嘅」。Beel 問何當時有否承諾過會否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求，何指「exactly 呢一句冇」，指她在很多場合有講述為何應否決預算案，但不認為可直接迫政府回應五大訴求，亦「唔想助長呢兩者之間嗰個聯繫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並解釋，印象中與會者事前無討論否決財案，甚至沒想過記者會問，而岑敖暉或任何記者會上的發言者均不是抗爭派的發言人（spokesman），當時是由最習慣面對傳媒的人坐第一排，「邊個想講就示意攞咪講」。法官陳慶偉問，因此岑的發言只代表自己，不代表何？何指岑發言前，「事前係冇同我哋討論過嘅，我當時亦都唔知道佢會咁樣講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5GwxmMY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉會上稱會否決財案-何指事前不知道記者會無發言人&quot;&gt;岑敖暉會上稱會否決財案 何指事前不知道、記者會無發言人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰一度問，何曾任記者，在召記者會前有否向與會者指重要的是傳達訊息，而不是被傳媒帶風向。何說「做記者同畀記者訪問係兩回事嚟嘅」，指她不是「跑daily」，訪問人可能是約兩小時討論很詳細的問題，故不會說有很豐富應對記者的經驗，但「記者問咩我認同係要直接作答嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於岑敖暉其後會上稱，望有初選結果後，民主派的路線分歧可以完結。何解釋，初選白熱化時確有選民印象是所謂抗爭派和傳統泛民之間有很多互相攻擊，故理解岑意指該些攻擊屬「路線之爭」，「初選本身就係為咗大家可以傾一個好啲嘅路線而搞嘅」；但初選後選民已作出其選擇，「咁所有出線嘅人就應該要聯合埋一齊去行動喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PpFSmcb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（27日）踏入審訊第93天。何桂藍繼續作供，就選舉主任以反對《國安法》為由指她不擁護《基本法》，並取消其參選資格，何強調「我自己嘅眼中，我係擁護（《基本法》）」，因當中有很多權力相互制衡的內容。何質疑選舉主任是主觀判斷，又指《國安法》不受司法監督、僭越立法會職能，並透過納入《基本法》附件三實施，感覺《基本法》被架空，「好難好文雅咁講，但係《國安法》嘅出現，令到《基本法》成為咗 condom 囉。」何又指被DQ後，曾認為「入立法會嗰個唔係我⋯我就以為因為呢單嘢而坐監嗰個就唔係我喇」，自言「天真」；又認為最後大規模DQ是對民主派最有利，可破除大家對跟制度行會有結果的迷信，亦反映不一定要妥協自保才有好結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後問何，是否同意控方指控她意圖以非法手段顛覆國家政權。何回應時指理解中國大陸的邏輯認為要求民主化是「顛覆」，「但係如果一個普通法嘅 court 要 endorse（認可）呢個諗法，我覺得係攬炒緊普通法。」何今完成8天主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何自言擁護基本法-惟選舉主任決定是主觀判斷&quot;&gt;何自言擁護《基本法》 惟選舉主任決定是主觀判斷&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍今繼續作供，她最終被DQ，理由是不真誠擁護《基本法》，大律師 Trevor Beel 問她有何回應。何先指對香港政府來說，「『擁護』呢兩隻字嘅意思係經常變」，她指正常人對「擁護」也有自己理解，但記得就香港民族黨陳浩天一案，「擁護」的定義包括「embrace（信奉）」和「promote（推廣）」，直言「呢樣嘢對正常人嚟講已經好難理解，即係我擁護你仲要幫手推廣埋你先至算嘅」。翻查資料，判詞指出擁護《基本法》不僅指遵守，還需支持、推廣及信奉《基本法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「我自己嘅眼中，我係擁護（《基本法》），因為《基本法》入面的確係有非常多權力相互制衡嘅內容嘅」，但何指到了選舉主任手上，「即係你點樣決定一個人 em- 唔 embrace、pro- 唔 promote，我覺得呢啲真係主觀判斷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何質疑國安法不受司法監督僭越立會職能-架空基本法&quot;&gt;何質疑《國安法》不受司法監督、僭越立會職能 架空《基本法》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又補充，選舉主任理據是她反對《國安法》因此她不擁護《基本法》，「但係《國安法》入面明明係講緊如果兩個法相衝突就以《國安法》為準。」惟李運騰即指《國安法》沒有這樣說。何回應「咁可能係京官解釋嘅時候提出呢樣嘢」，李指「我不認為任何人有這樣說」，但指不重要，這是何的印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指「呢個容後處理啦」，並指另有條款是「國安公署係唔受香港特別行政區管轄嘅」，李運騰反問「是嗎？」，何說好像是第60條，Beel 說是62條。李重申不認為該條款與何所說的完全一樣，不過這是何的印象。何再說，「然後又話國安公署簽署嘅文件喺香港係有法律效力嘅，我唔記得 exact wording 啦，但國安人員嘅做法係唔經司法覆核嘅」，李再次說不完全是條文的說法，並問何是想說什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後一度欲說明第62條內容，惟陳慶偉打斷，指法庭不關注，再問何想說什麼。何指「我嘅意思係，即係我唔識法律啦，但一個正常人睇完呢啲條款，個感覺就係成份《基本法》架空咗囉，又唔受司法監督、立法會嘅職能佢都可以僭越埋⋯⋯最重要佢係透過附件三擺入《基本法》，今日擺《國安法》、聽日擺《間諜法》、後日擺《對外關係法》咁，真係好難好文雅咁講，但係《國安法》嘅出現，令到《基本法》成為咗 condom 囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何質疑國安法時遭官打斷-官指毋須深究法庭有限度&quot;&gt;何質疑《國安法》時遭官打斷 官指毋須深究法庭有限度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何欲繼續解釋時，遭陳慶偉大聲打斷，說「我不認為我們要深究這些（“I don’t think we need to go into all this.”）」，Beel 一度說認為法庭容許何回答，陳再大聲說「不，我不准她回答」。李運騰續指這是何當時的理解和印象，但到底想說什麼，何指是「答緊我係咪擁護《基本法》個問題」，惟李指何已回答她認為自己擁護《基本法》，故不同意選舉主任的決定。何一度再欲回應，惟陳慶偉再打斷，指知道 Beel 有困難的工作，「但法庭也有限度。（“…there is also a limit for the court.”）」Beel 續就另一議題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，《國安法》第60條指國安公署及其人員依《國安法》執行職務的行為，不受香港特區管轄，62條指香港特區本地法律規定與《國安法》不一致的，適用《國安法》規定。至於第14條則提及，維護國家安全委員會作出的決定不受司法覆核。至於第57條則列明，國安公署為採強制和偵查措施，及司法裁判而簽發的法律文書在港具有法律效力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何曾以為入不到立會繼續議會抗爭便不用因此坐監-自言天真&quot;&gt;何曾以為入不到立會繼續議會抗爭便不用因此坐監 自言「天真」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後展示何桂藍7月30日的帖文〈是你們每一個人的一票起了作用〉，提及「收到被DQ的消息，說實話，團隊固然有所失落，但也不無興奮的聲音」，何笑言同意「團隊失落，我好興奮」，解釋當時原初也有想過「係咪真係要入去（議會）」，「但其實最後反正都係DQ或者畀人拉嘅話，早啲完，或者都係一件好事」，何又指，「我當時嘅諗法，如果入立法會嗰個唔係我，但而家睇返我天真啦，我就以為因為呢單嘢而坐監嗰個就唔係我喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何補充，「簡單嚟講就係我當時以為入到立法會、繼續議會抗爭，先會因為初選呢件事而畀人拉，既然我行唔到嗰步，咁應該就唔會喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱大規模dq反而對民主派最有利不一定妥協自保才有好結果&quot;&gt;何稱大規模DQ反而對民主派最有利、不一定妥協自保才有好結果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就帖文提及「對香港而言最壞的情況，就是選舉『如常』進行」，何重申如很少數人被DQ，大家雖會知道不公義，但焦點也會迅速轉移至剩下的人，「咁立法會選舉就仍然會有非常多人投票，但嗰個票數好可能就反而 endorse（認可）緊一個好唔公正嘅選舉」，故認為該情況對民主派更加不利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「運動精神是甚麼？攬炒啊。反抗，是求生的唯一出路」，何指當時DQ規模「真係好大」，同一日包括她和公民黨等十多人被DQ，可見所有光譜無一倖免。何指當時的確有很多民眾仍會覺得「哇D到咁，好失望呀，或者輸晒冇得贏喇」，因此何想解釋為何這個「跨光譜大規模DQ」是對民主派有利、對政權反而有損害的結果，簡單而言「政權行呢一步佢哋付出嘅代價都非常之沉重」，亦呼應選民對「攬炒」的想像。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何重申，「反抗，是求生的唯一出路」，是因整場選舉不停討論避過DQ和表態會怎樣，但她個人一直採取反抗立場，並認為最終結果反而是對民主派最有利，「即係話唔一定要縮、唔一定要妥協自保，先可以得到一個好嘅結果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱大規模dq可破除跟制度行會有結果的迷信&quot;&gt;何稱大規模DQ可破除跟制度行會有結果的迷信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於帖文提到這次大規模DQ，「完全將選舉作為『以神聖一票選出民意代表』的機制無效化，也將鳥籠式選舉吸納、消弭政治運動能量的功能完全扼殺」，何重申「鳥籠式選舉」是令很多人相信「跟住制度內嘅規矩、喺制度內爭取係會有結果」，但大規模DQ反而可令更多市民看得非常清楚，「只要政權喺現行制度之下佢有輸或者被挑戰嘅可能，佢其實係會直接破壞個制度，都要迴避個挑戰。」何續指因此她相信，「咁樣就可以破除到大家對『跟住制度行就會有結果』嘅呢個迷信，因為制度本身都係按照政權嘅喜好浮動咁變化。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問是否意圖顛覆-何如普通法法庭認可此想法是攬炒緊普通法&quot;&gt;被問是否意圖顛覆 何：如普通法法庭認可此想法，是「攬炒緊普通法」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 午休後向何桂藍指出案情，問何有否聽過被告任何無差別否決預算案、癱瘓政府運作和解散立法會的協議，何一一否認。Beel 再問何有否聽過迫特首下台的協議，何思考數秒後說：「咁喺條街都聽過幾十萬人嗌林鄭下台嘅。」李運騰指不只是說口號，而是被告導致特首下台的協議，何續回應沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，何是否同意控方指，她當選後會濫用《基本法》第73條的職權，何回應：「我會形容我係想還原返個職能」，故不同意控方指控，她亦不同意當選後會無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問，何是否同意控方指控她意圖以非法手段顛覆國家政權，嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞特區政權機關依法履行職能？何停頓一會表示：「我可以理解點解喺中國大陸嘅 logic，咁樣係顛覆嘅，I mean 要求民主化呢樣嘢。但係如果一個普通法嘅 court 要 endorse（認可）呢個諗法，我覺得係攬炒緊普通法。」李運騰指理解何即不同意，何說：「喺呢個 court，disagree。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍完成8天主問-林卓廷一方明將盤問&quot;&gt;何桂藍完成8天主問 林卓廷一方明將盤問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 表示沒有其他問題，何桂藍完成8天主問。何下午作供期間，咪高峰一直傳來雜聲，法官關注是否有人觸碰到咪，何並說：「唔好意思，希望法官可以處理一下，因為我份人比較易嘔，我依家已經唔舒服。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉其後指沒有盤問，但望申請於下周二才開始陳志全的案情，陳慶偉認為合理，但不認為屆時能完成何的盤問。代表林卓廷的大律師沈士文則指會有約30分鐘盤問，陳慶偉續提議由於何桂藍感不適，可押至明早處理。惟何即說：「如果聽朝返嚟個咪都係咁我都係唔舒服」，又澄清「我係驚我將會唔舒服」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續指，明早有事情要辦，望能今天處理。陳慶偉問他明早需時多久，沈回應於10時半完成，陳慶偉續指明天不早於10時半續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍稱期望所有民主派參選人均認識到-於立選承諾爭取是空頭支票&quot;&gt;何桂藍稱期望所有民主派參選人均認識到 於立選承諾爭取是空頭支票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方今亦就何的選舉單張發問，顯示有何桂藍和岑敖暉的相片。何解釋於7月尾設計，原用作選舉通函，但「未定稿就被DQ咗」，呈堂的是接近完成的初稿。何並指除岑的部分，其餘內容都是她所寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;單張上提及「如果香港立會還可以正常議事，我們會爭取」，並列出何的政綱，但上面以「The truth is」的藍色字覆蓋並劃去。何解釋如立法會正常，大家在選舉當然關注候選人的政綱，但她將政綱全劃去，並注明「承諾爭取咩係空頭支票嚟」，形容是她對所有民主派參選人應如何看待立法會選舉的期望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問何說「我們」時，是否指她和岑敖暉，何重申「我希望成個民主陣營都有呢個認識」，因選舉通函某程度上也是提出一個主張，望其他人接受。法官關注讀者是否會認為這是二人的共同政綱，何解釋岑將其部分發給她，但她的部分未給岑看，而「提名期一完第二日就DQ喇」，岑終無機會回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱若dq仍打算公開通函-讓新東選民知道本身可以選一個點樣嘅人&quot;&gt;何稱若DQ仍打算公開通函 讓新東選民知道「本身可以選一個點樣嘅人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問她如認為自己會被DQ，為何仍製作通函，何解釋當時打算被DQ就自行公開通函，想傳達的訊息是「政府究竟DQ緊一個點樣嘅候選人，如果政府冇濫用佢DQ嘅權力嘅話，新界東選民本身可以選一個點樣嘅人」，故當時「亦都係用一種真係去選嘅心態去準備呢份通函」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡一度問，何是否認為自己會被DQ，但不想岑敖暉被DQ。何重申當時判斷「有開過聲反對過《國安法》嘅人都一定會被DQ㗎喇」，並強調「DQ真係唔係我哋想唔想，我哋唔想都冇得避免，除非我哋徹底咁改變立場，但係咁樣參選都冇意義喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指年輕候選人被批無倡議只想反政府-故列出政綱惟非承諾可爭取什麼&quot;&gt;何指年輕候選人被批無倡議只想反政府 故列出政綱、惟非承諾可爭取什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又解釋，當時無論建制派或選民也會批評，很多年輕候選人「根本冇任何嘅倡議，佢哋只係想反政府」，而何雖認為承諾爭取只是「開出空頭支票」，但認為「有必要擺埋出嚟，如果我可以爭取、我可以倡議嘅話，我嘅立場係啲乜嘢，咁選民就可以見到我本身係主張緊啲乜；但佢哋同時唔會有所誤會，我將呢啲政綱列出嚟，係向佢哋承諾緊，如果我入到立法會我就會爭取緊呢一啲嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，同時她亦是表達，當民主派決定將議會作為抗爭陣地時，「其實個立法會本身係可以、或者應該要做到啲乜嘢，但好可惜我哋而家喺現行制度下係冇辦法做到。」Beel 問，若何想讓選民看到，為何最終沒有發布。何一度反問「我有冇擺上 Facebook？」，Beel 說他不知道，多人發笑，何後指印象中有，但應無再作修改。&lt;/p&gt;

This paper seeks to explain what is driving changes to land forces’ command and control, the enterprise architecture that best supports the emerging requirements, and the implications for how command is practised.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maturation of an ecosystem of data bearers and data management tools means battlefield hyperconnectivity is now realisable for militaries. Forces that can leverage these capabilities are likely to secure a competitive advantage over those that cannot. However, adopting these technologies requires a series of changes in how land forces conduct command and control (C2). To that end, this paper seeks to explain what is driving changes to land forces’ C2, the enterprise architecture that best supports the emerging requirements, and the implications for how command is practised. The foremost drivers of change are that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Armies that achieve greater situational awareness will have a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Situational awareness is achieved by moving relevant data between both units at echelon and sensors and effectors to enable forces to converge their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data relevance must either be determined by pre-agreed prioritisation or by analysis conducted at higher echelon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latency in data transfer must be minimised for control of effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latency may be high for command of the force, but the picture must constitute as complete a data set as can be reasonably assembled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low-latency, high-bandwidth communications impose an unacceptable draw on power for most tactical units, which must support low-latency, low-bandwidth communication to maintain situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concentration of analytical capacity at higher echelons exposes the formation to an unacceptable degree of risk from long-range fires unless these elements can be dispersed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dispersion demands the automation of a significant proportion of headquarters tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automation demands a bearer-agnostic heterogeneous data ecosystem for the force, the remotely accessible nature of which also makes it vulnerable to cyber attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any future C2 architecture must degrade gracefully and in a predictable manner under constant disruption of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Envisaging a single architecture that can support all requirements in future military networks is a mistake. Instead, it is better to design future land forces’ communications on three network types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tactical networks aimed at enabling lateral situational awareness, demanding high assurance, low bandwidth and medium-latency traffic. These are best delivered through mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fire control architecture able to move ISR collection beyond line of sight through a contested EMS. This is best delivered by a bearer-agnostic heterogeneous network governed by a prioritisation stack delivering low-latency, high-bandwidth communications, theorised as a kill web.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An operational command network through which headquarters can distribute orders and supporting information, and gather situation reports from across the force that require moderate assurance of access, can function with high latency and offers medium bandwidth. This is best delivered through a combat cloud, accessed through satellite bearers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the tactical situation means that these networks should not be fully integrated, it is critical that appropriate data can pass between them. What distinguishes them is their bearers and how data is managed on the system. It is therefore important that common data standards are used to enable information egress between these three network architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of such an architecture would have some implications for how command is exercised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it would be important for commanders to exercise greater command discipline because the architecture would give them sight of (and the ability to direct) sub-tactical activity. Used properly, this access would be invaluable in helping them to allocate and distribute their resources and reserves. However, it would also be disastrous if operational commanders were drawn into interfering with tactical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure would also change how headquarters function because dispersion and disaggregation, while necessary to ensure survivability, would isolate teams and make it difficult for a chief of staff to maintain a headquarters battle rhythm. It would therefore be crucial for different teams to actively strive to collaborate and to contribute where possible, rather than standing up and down in sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system would also depend heavily on AI to drive prioritisation and assist smaller staffs to plan and fuse information. Trust in these tools would be critical and training would be required to ensure their proper employment. Most of the time, it would not be viable to have a human in the loop or to have personnel understand how AI reached its decisions. For this reason, it would be necessary for AI tools to have clearly defined purposes so that confidence could be maintained by assessing them against their results. Human supervision would remain on the loop to provide assurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assurance of the architecture would also be critical to ensuring that personnel remained confident in it. This would require active cyber defence, as well as a shift in mindset from an expectation of absolute security to an appreciation of relative security. The expectation should not be that the communications architecture is sufficiently robust to always operate at peak efficiency but should instead be anticipated to be continually disrupted. Troops must therefore use its benefits as a force multiplier rather than relying on its outputs as a crutch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, such a C2 architecture would render the EMS a plane of manoeuvre and the force’s posture would need to shift from minimal emissions to one in which emissions were continuous, but ambiguous. Force protection would depend on active enemy kill chain disruption rather than passive concealment. A beareragnostic approach would also mean that assurance of access to communications would need to be fought for and resourced. Units would proactively plan to fight for connectivity levels, rather than simply being forced from primary to alternative, contingent and emergency communications protocols based on adversary activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four primary factors drive the evolution of land warfare: arms; logistics; societal capacity; and communications. Arms development drives an evolution in tactics to employ and mitigate their effects. Gunpowder, for instance, progressively inverted survivability from being gained through elevation to being premised on separation and excavation. The development of new logistical capabilities determines the force size that can be sustained, the reach at which it can be projected and the speed at which it can move. Thus, the combustion engine drastically increased the tempo of operations. Societal structure determines the scale at which wars can be fought and thus its character. A society only able to generate warbands is limited in the ground that it can control, creating conflict dynamics that are driven by violence as a tool of influence and raiding being a primary function. By contrast, an industrialised society that can conscript millions of troops pushes conflict towards absolute ends. Meanwhile, communications drive the agility and complexity with which military force can be employed. For instance, it was hard to conceive of the synchronisation of operational theatres until it was possible to communicate between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it has become popular to propose that advances in technology lead to “revolutions in military affairs”, it is important to note that the actual introduction of emerging technologies into military service often takes 30 years before they mature enough to significantly alter the character of war. The machine gun, for example, had been in service for three decades by the time of the Battle of the Somme. The pace of evolution is sometimes faster, especially when evolutions in two or more of the factors align. Nevertheless, rather than viewing the advancement of military activity as being driven by breakthrough technologies, it is more realistic to argue that militaries adapt as a technology’s implications become sufficiently clear and the capability itself matures enough to allow for general adoption. The force that transforms the battlefield tends not to be the first to employ a capability, but rather the first to work out how to employ it at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering the emergence of hyperconnectivity, it is reasonable to argue that we are approaching the 30-year horizon at which the implications of the internet and personal mobile telecommunications are sufficiently mature to drive an evolution in the character of war. As with previous technological developments, it is not that data has not played a significant role on recent battlefields. Nevertheless, its use within land forces to date has largely replicated structures that were originally designed in an analogue age, or else represent niche components attached to legacy orders of battle. The military may have swapped out analogue for software-defined radios, but the layout, staffing and functions of a modern military headquarters is recognisable when compared with its equivalent from the 1980s. It has bloated as more and more novel systems and capabilities have been added, but the fundamental underlying structure and logic remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continuity in the military contrasts with the transformative impact of hyperconnectivity in some civilian organisations. While the implications of having ubiquitous access to data have driven a great deal of military theorising about future warfare, the practicalities of power generation in the field, signature management and communications security have all limited the adoption of many civilian methods. Nevertheless, it is becoming clear that the force that is best able to structure and equip itself to most efficiently and securely use available technology will have an advantage over its adversaries. As with previous moments, adopting modern technology at scale can be done more or less effectively. The French, for example, attempted to gain first-mover advantage when they invented smokeless powder and, as a consequence, ended up with the least ergonomic small arms of the major powers. Their early lead was shortlived. It is important to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the existing literature on data and the modern battlefield fits into two distinct categories. The first comprises highly technical studies of network architectures, often examining specific new technologies like encryption methods and bearer types, and revolving around programmes of record. The second emanates from military concepts like Multi-Domain Integration or Joint All-Domain Command and Control, and tends to describe an end state of perfect situational awareness with very limited engagement with the practical limitations or technologies. The former, while grounded in reality, fails to explore how a force may change how it operates as a result of evolutions in communications. Instead, it focuses on refining existing capabilities or accelerating established processes. The latter presupposes that the technology will catch up with the concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to straddle the divide between these bodies of literature, this paper takes the developments in the technology and considers how they may drive changes in the structure of how land forces are organised and how they conduct command and control (C2). It sets out a conceptual framework for thinking about the opportunities that modern communications currently present to land forces, how a force might be organised to seize them, and the communications architecture necessary to support that structure. This is not a survey of existing programmes aimed at modernising military communications. While cognisant of the trajectory of Morpheus, Mercury, Zodiac and Theia, among others, a heavy focus on these projects and programmes risks making the articulated requirement deterministic. Nor should this study be considered an attempt at systems architecture. Instead, it should be viewed as an effort to draw the enterprise architecture of C2 in the land domain to best seize the opportunities on a data-rich battlefield and mitigate emerging risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on land forces requires some explanation, since modern communications architectures aim at linking the joint force and depend heavily on both the space and cyber domains. First, land forces face some distinct challenges when managing large data volumes. These largely arise from the significantly greater number of points that must be connected in a land force, the limited power available to soldier-borne systems compared with more platform-centric domains, and the interference that complex terrain generates. The changes in communications architecture also have domain-specific effects on C2 for land forces. So, this paper should not be seen as excluding the other domains. Some of the networks discussed are implicitly or explicitly joint, but their effects on how a force fights are discussed as they apply to land forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be contended that this paper is not primarily about C2, but rather command, control, communications and computers (C4). This is correct, but C4 as an acronym is deeply unhelpful. Command and control are related but separate functions. The former concerns the conception and dissemination of purpose among bodies of troops, while the latter comprises the direction of the implementation of plans in pursuit of the defined purpose. Communications and computers, by contrast, are not functions but tools. Thus, this paper explains how the evolution of communication and computing tools realistically interact with and alter the exercise of C2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth clarifying why a distinction is made between communications and computers. Since many communications devices are computers, this acronym is also unsatisfactory. The distinction is clearer if it is understood as that between bearers/networks and services/applications. The former is how data is moved, while the latter is concerned with what is done to it on a device. It is perhaps useful to explain this in relation to an everyday tool: the smartphone. A smartphone may use 3G, 4G, 5G or WiFi networks, which are different bearers. However, the encryption, decryption, presentation and input of the information being transmitted might be managed by a range of different services, including WhatsApp or Signal, which are distinct applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is structured in three chapters. Chapter I outlines some of the opportunities and risks that modern communications pose and how these pressure the force to adapt from existing C2 practices if they are to be correspondingly realised or mitigated. Chapter II takes the drivers outlined in Chapter I and breaks down the architectures necessary to field the capabilities described. Chapter III seeks to map the non-structural implications for how the force would need to adapt if it were to effectively employ the systems outlined in Chapter II. The methodologies for this work are diverse, but at its core the paper is based on real-world experimentation with emerging communications systems and observation of exercises and operations on which various communication systems have been tested and employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-drivers-of-change&quot;&gt;I. Drivers of Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To grasp how the exercise of C2 over land forces can adapt to best employ emerging capabilities or to mitigate the risks they pose to a traditionally structured force, it is necessary to understand how these capabilities exert pressure on the existing C2 architecture. This chapter outlines several opportunities and risks that are assessed to be drivers of change that the force must acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;situational-awareness-as-a-combat-multiplier&quot;&gt;Situational Awareness as a Combat Multiplier&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The miniaturisation of computing means that today’s battlefield is saturated with high-fidelity sensors and detections that can be retained and transmitted. The proliferation of digital systems means that the modern battlefield is data rich; the question is whether the available data can be accessed and exploited. The combination of radar, electro-optical, acoustic, electromagnetic, thermal and positional sensor payloads on vehicles and personnel is remarkable in terms of the distances at which enemies can be detected. This effect is magnified exponentially when multiple sensors can be fused on a given platform and interrogated algorithmically with edge processing, and is amplified again if the picture from these sensors can be shared. Historically, humans carried out and logged target detection and classification across the battlefield. Voice was the only way to disseminate this in real time, and there was a limit to how much of this information could be shared. Nor could it be rapidly updated. However, the automated classification of objects by sensors – combined with humans logging their own observations as data – allows vastly more detections to be available to be fused if the data can be collated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this data can be accessed, the situational awareness of personnel across the force would radically improve. Situational awareness may be defined as the extent to which a soldier understands where they are in relation to friends and adversaries, and what those around them are trying to achieve. Having better situational awareness than the adversary gives a force a competitive edge. To use a single example, a force in which each friendly entity can accurately track its own position and communicate this will give each soldier the ability to access blue force tracking. The inability to access blue force tracking imposes a wide range of constraints on operations. First, there is the temporal impact of needing to confirm that detected movements are hostile before delivering or calling for effects to be delivered against them. Second, there are the constraints that the need to deconflict fields of fire and axes of advance impose on manoeuvre. This leads to the imposition of boundaries between units, which often creates seams (and therefore weaknesses) in formations that the enemy can exploit. Third, there is the psychological constraint imposed on soldiers by the uncertainty regarding their exposure and the extent of support once supporting or neighbouring troops are out of sight. Blue force tracking would: enable soldiers to engage enemy forces more rapidly while reducing the risk of blue-on-blue engagements; increase the freedom to manoeuvre by allowing a force to have dynamic unit boundaries; and offer a soldier psychological reassurance that they are supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basis on which situational awareness may be described as a combat multiplier is the transformative effect it has on mission command. As originally conceived, mission command was premised on the ability of a soldier to use their initiative to improve their position in a manner conforming to a broader intent in the absence of centralised instruction. Of course, the risk is that multiple commanders exercising this judgement reach contradictory or conflicting conclusions based on the limited information available to them. The greater the situational awareness of all troops, the more context they have to confidently exercise mission command. This might be termed convergence. If mission command is premised on a soldier’s ability to maintain a trajectory without supervision, with situational awareness, soldiers should be able to converge to dynamically cover gaps and exploit opportunities in a manner that deviates significantly from initial plans without dislocating the force. In short, situational awareness allows the trajectory to alter in flight. Setting the conditions for convergence also reduces the interventions necessary from command, allowing commanders to think ahead rather than become fixed in cohering disparate actions across a force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring about this situational awareness, it is necessary for data to move laterally across a force. It is not necessary, for example, for the corps commander to know that an infantry section is moving left around an obstacle rather than right. But if this movement brings the infantry section into the field of view of a friendly unit under a different commander, then this section’s identity is highly relevant to these personnel. This is not how most legacy military communications architectures function. Traditionally, military communications are structured to allow data to flow up and down echelons. Where there is communication within a group like the company net, the architecture is usually a hub-and-spoke model in which data is passed upwards and then downwards between sections rather than directly across the organisation. The challenge is that large lateral data movements are not viable on the same network as large vertical ones in systems where one speaker is prioritised at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lateral data movement and convergence also poses a challenge for commanders because the accumulation of the same data gives a granularity to senior officers that encourages them to take a view and correct their subordinates’ activities. In a context where subordinates are exercising mission command, but their movements are visible to senior commanders, the risk is that the commander begins to try and exercise control, slowing down and confusing activity rather than increasing the precision of execution. An organisation that gives a section commander the same picture of the tactical problem as the company commander creates opportunities but also expands the capacity for commanders to misuse the fidelity of the understanding they have access to. Maximising situational awareness will increase combat effectiveness but must drive a different architecture for communications and a new culture of command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;saturation&quot;&gt;Saturation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although situational awareness can be enabled through the lateral movement of relevant data, the capacity to process and understand information for units at the tactical edge is finite and the effects available to units in contact to exploit information obtained is similarly limited. Furthermore, as more data is accumulated, it can both improve the judgement and effects deliverable at an echelon while increasing the capacity necessary to process and use the information. Data is not in and of itself a force multiplier; it is only one if it is relevant, and establishing what is relevant to a given user presents several challenges. Moreover, data’s relevance has a shelf life. If the process of ingesting, analysing and determining the relevance of information is longer than the period for which it was relevant to a user, then the data has proven a capacity-wasting burden rather than a force multiplier. Historically, echelons have not only been divided by the span of their control but also by the temporal span of their interest. Higher headquarters ought to think further ahead and have the capacity to do so. The problem today is that a force that can accumulate information rapidly in the right place can converge effects across or between echelons to achieve a decisive advantage. For example, a missile fired from the brigade echelon may have a greater chance of striking its target if the corps can deliver a cyber payload against an enemy air defence system defending the missile’s target, which it may need to deliver using an electronic warfare (EW) effector held at the division, while the detection of the air defence target may have been achieved using national technical means. Conversely, the range of fires means that echelons are often simultaneously engaged throughout their operational depth. If the battlefield is saturated with high-fidelity sensors, the force that can get the right information from the right sensor to the right user has a significant advantage over one that holds but cannot transmit, process and act on the information within it. This is what concepts like Joint All-Domain Command and Control promise, but they often do not address the consequent risk of saturation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of saturation risk: analytical saturation; and bearer network saturation. Avoiding analytical saturation requires the prioritisation of information based on relevance to the end user. A plans cell, for example, likely requires the greatest possible volume of information to be available to them. Given the volume of data generated on a modern battlefield, there is also a strong argument for such functions to be pulled up echelon or delivered through reach-back, so that there is capacity to store and interrogate large volumes of data with sufficient computing infrastructure and analytical personnel. A tactical commander, by contrast, is going to be unable to analyse the volume of data from most of the battlefield, much of which will be of limited relevance to them. There may be many data points that are relevant to them, but they cannot be the ones finding them. Thus, data must either be brought to higher echelons, processed, analysed and then disseminated, or there must be a sift for data that is known to be relevant to a particular tactical formation at the edge using edge processing so that this can be prioritised for transfer to the end user. The answer is not one or the other but depends on the latency requirements of the given data type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bearer network saturation is inevitable if all information is attempted to be assembled all the time. The volume of data on the battlefield is expanding faster than the bearer capacity to move it. Prioritisation reduces the volume of data that needs to be moved from one location to another and prevents this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latency is another means of reducing the requirements on the bearer network. If there is no requirement for low-latency transfer, information can be routed inefficiently to fill up slack capacity or underutilised links, or held back for transfer once higher-priority information has been moved. Conversely, higher-priority information can be moved rapidly via any available means, even if this means suppressing the movement of lower-priority information. A good example here might be to contrast track quality data on an enemy air or missile threat with a routine situation report from a screening unit. Clearly, the former takes precedence. When one maps the prioritisations likely in a modern force, this does not conform to the order of battle. Thus, information may, in certain contexts, need to jump echelons entirely, move rapidly laterally between units, or else a commander’s information requirements may in fact justify de-prioritisation. Seniority does not necessarily determine the latency requirements for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way that saturation can become a critical threat to the system, and thus a driver for its design, is power consumption. Soldiers can only carry so much power. Processing and analysing data consumes a great deal and must be centralised. Transmission of large-bandwidth data over distance also draws on considerable power. For tactical echelons wishing to maintain persistent situational awareness, moreover, power consumption is a constant, whereas the ability to move information at low latency is an intermittent but essential requirement for critical systems. If the intervening elements have run out of power and are unable to transmit this data, the system breaks down. Conversely, if low-latency or higher-echelon critical information requirements route traffic through tactical units on a routine basis, they risk running down the force’s available power and leading to blackouts or creating a massive logistical demand for batteries. The need to avoid saturation is thus a critical determinant of how future C2 architectures must be structured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;precision-fires-as-a-pervasive-threat&quot;&gt;Precision Fires as a Pervasive Threat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, situational awareness may be a force multiplier, but constructing a relevant picture of the battlespace from a huge volume of data requires analytical capacity and power, which drives centralisation into headquarters. This was certainly how these challenges were managed during the War on Terror, when brigade headquarters grew attachments until they were orders of magnitude larger than a viable warfighting formation even in the 1980s. This situation is only possible because of the low threat from enemy fires in these environments. At the same time, the capacity to find such concentrated entities on the modern battlefield has expanded drastically because of the saturation of the battlefield with stand-off sensors, especially in the joint environment. Furthermore, the proliferation of loitering munitions and cruise and ballistic missiles – offering precise, layered and long-range fires – means that such facilities can be held at threat at any relevant operational depth to land forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pervasive threat of detection and long-range precision fires drives several structural requirements for the C2 infrastructure that introduce friction into the characteristics outlined above. First, there is a need to either be highly mobile or make an element’s signature minimal or ambiguous. Second, on the assumption that the adversary might be lucky even against the most disciplined of forces, the headquarters should be dispersed to reduce its exposure to fires. This may even mean the dispersion of headquarters functions between states or continents. Here, there is a tension between the concentration driven by the demand for analytical capacity and power to process the available data, and the need to be survivable driving the disaggregation of headquarters elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest irony is that the direction of long-range precision fires likely creates one of the foremost demands on low-latency, high-bandwidth communication and rapid data fusion and analysis for the purposes of fire control. At the same time, it is precisely these fires that render the establishment of the infrastructure to support such a capability most precarious. Again, therefore, there is a compelling reason to strive to be able to ingest, interrogate and use the data on the modern battlefield. However, the side that is able to do it most efficiently – with a lower signature, greater dispersion and likely more effective prioritisation – will have a competitive advantage that should grow as Lanchester equations make fire exchanges more unequal over time. Lanchester equations highlight how attrition constrains force projection so that as one force suffers greater losses, its relative loss at each exchange expands. They have proven highly unsatisfactory in assessing engagements for much of the 20th century, but the advent of mass precision may make them more relevant to future exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dispersion is a sensible approach to expanding survivability, but it poses major challenges for assuring a capability’s delivery. Once key functions are geographically separated, communication not only becomes vital for the exercising of C2 but also in the internal functioning of the headquarters. A dispersed force therefore begins to build in single points of failure. Whereas a headquarters with co-located functions can physically connect parts of its internal infrastructure (and, failing that, physically co-locate staff as a reversionary means of overcoming connectivity issues), a dispersed force becomes entirely dependent on its network. This renders it vulnerable to another kind of precision effect which modern sensors and targeting processes can make effective at long range: EW. The ability to interrogate the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) combined with the use of software-defined EW systems means that it is becoming easier to assess a target network’s characteristics, build a payload to achieve the greatest possible disruption and deliver it at reach in combat-relevant timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interrogation-by-machine&quot;&gt;Interrogation by Machine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical enabler of dynamic and precise electronic attack is the employment of AI to support the creation of effects. This is also arguably the most effective means of prioritising bandwidth. Use cases for AI are often framed around the analysis of vast data sets. However, since assembling such data sets is often prohibitively burdensome for a deployed network, AI can depend on machine learning (ML) used at the edge to fuse sensor data on the originating platform and package what is sent to higher echelons or laterally to key users. Again, such judgements become the basis for managing latency too. An F35, for example, generates far more data than it can relay, but much of that can be centrally ingested once it lands and is plugged into an autonomic logistics information system (ALIS) terminal. The question concerns what cannot wait and ensuring that what is off-boarded moves with sufficient metadata to be useable by another system with incomplete information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ML-enabled reconnaissance and AI-enabled bandwidth prioritisation is likely to give a force a decisive situational awareness advantage because of the efficiency gains it offers in sensor performance. At its most basic, humans interrogating a sensor feed tend to distinguish signal from noise through the size of deviation from the background environment. ML-driven data interrogation is different. ML systems define objects by reference to unique characteristics, and deviation from those are therefore counted irrespective of magnitude. This can create problems. An ML algorithm trained to look for humans may, for instance, fail to classify a person walking underneath a cardboard box as such because it deviates from the prescribed definition. A human would, by contrast, note the contrast with the background environment and deduce what was under the cardboard box. However, in terms of sensor data, the implication of this difference is that ML algorithms will make detections based on far smaller – and less distinct – returns than a human. Thus, if appropriately applied, ML will significantly increase the range and accuracy of detections, thereby improving the fidelity of the situational awareness available to be transmitted across the force. The point is that a force that fails to capitalise on such capabilities risks being uncompetitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI also offers a support tool to higher headquarters for data ingestion and analysis, as well as the creation of courses of action in planning. It may also contribute to another form of situational awareness relevant to those exercising command: the ability to anticipate adversary moves. A good example of this has been demonstrated in Ukraine, where 18 Airborne Corps, monitoring Russian activity from space, is able to use AI to anticipate whether Russia is about to conduct offensive action by recognising artillery fire patterns. The use of AI in headquarters is also the most likely means of enabling dispersion as it would reduce the necessary size of a given staff element. The aim would not be to replace the commander or the supporting headquarters functions. Instead, by using AI to rapidly assemble the labour-intensive products that must underpin an assessment of a course of action, it would reduce the headquarters’ footprint. A good analogy is the introduction of satellite navigation tools used by drivers in cars. Prior to the availability of applications like Google Maps, ubiquitous cellular connectivity, real-time traffic-density data and algorithms able to compare viable routes, dynamic navigation while driving required a second person to work with a map, or the driver to stop the vehicle to look at one. Today, a single driver can leave the navigation to their phone, reducing the number of people required to dynamically assess viable routes. Drawing up a scheme of manoeuvre based on terrain and an assessment of adversary troop strength is something that AI can do, even if a human wants to select from the options generated and potentially tweak the eventual scheme. It is in these more basic functions that AI is likely to best enable the force, not in complex decision support tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two requirements for such a system to reduce a headquarters’ size and enable dispersion. First, data must be bearer agnostic. That is to say that for a headquarters to assemble the relevant information at the speed of relevance, it will need to accumulate data from a range of units that, transmitting over various distances in the face of differing threats and interference, will be communicating on different bearers. Some will be using civilian comms, others will be using high-frequency radio or satellite communication. Inputs from these feeds have historically been separate and required human integration. If a headquarters’ headcount is to be reduced, these feeds will need to be fused with human supervision, but not through manual data transfer between systems. The data’s format and language must be compatible so that systems supporting a headquarters can properly ingest the information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-attack-as-a-persistent-threat&quot;&gt;Cyber Attack as a Persistent Threat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to ensure that data can be transferred through multiple bearers and ingested by systems from multiple feeds means that the future C2 architecture is significantly more accessible than its predecessors. But such a system is vulnerable to cyber attack and, if it is to be useable, cannot be proofed against this. So long as humans are involved, means of access and interference exist. The protocols and permissions inside the system may limit the impact or scale of possible interference, but it will occur. Furthermore, any system that is accessible beyond line of sight can be targeted not just by an opponent’s military but also by their non-military institutions, vastly increasing the resource available to attack it. Again, the battlefield advantages of such a system drive its adoption to retain competitiveness even as it creates vulnerability. Appreciating that such a system will be attacked and that attacks will succeed, its survivability becomes a question of how well its borders in cyberspace are patrolled. Vigilant cyber threat intelligence, systems monitoring and incident response can maintain a system’s survivability even against the most persistent and aggressive adversary. The banking sector provides evidence of this: while a highly diverse set of actors continuously attack it, and intrusions and data loss occur, this threat does not fundamentally prevent the system’s functioning. The sector does, however, invest heavily in active network defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike electronic attack or precision fires, the cyber threat does not diminish in peacetime. Hostile forces are continuously tasked with infiltrating payloads against digital systems outside of an armed conflict. Far from this being the nefarious and irresponsible practice of rogue actors, the time it takes to reconnoitre a hostile network, gain access, design and deliver a payload, and establish a trigger mechanism, means that this is an activity that must be practised continuously. If it is not, then such capabilities will not be available when they are required. The result is that headquarters must be on a permanent war footing when it comes to network assurance. Detecting and closing intrusions is an ongoing commitment. This requires expertise that does not traditionally exist within militaries and means that while one part of a headquarters may be exercising, its cyber defenders are very much on operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resilience-by-design&quot;&gt;Resilience by Design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the advantages of the processes already described in this chapter, it follows that breaking down an adversary’s communications architecture and monitoring to inform targeting are key collection priorities for any force. However, there are some misconceptions about the dynamics likely to dominate the future battlefield in relation to the contestation of the EMS. First, the prospect of a denied EMS has been widely hypothesised. While possible over a limited area for a limited period, total denial of the EMS is not viable because the emitters necessary to deliver such an effect are themselves highly vulnerable to strike. Conversely, however, there is often a conflation of resilience and assurance that is deeply problematic. Designing a communications architecture that is highly resistant to jamming and interference is a worthy but impractical aspiration. As software-defined electronic attack systems are twinned with AI and ML, it will become increasingly possible to deliver bespoke payloads that optimally target communications systems. The likelihood is that while total denial will be impossible, continuous disruption to parts of the EMS and the uneven interruption of transmission will be a feature of the future battlefield. It is also important to note that forces will want to minimise their signature under many circumstances and may proactively withdraw from networks to do so. They may also wish to practice deception and mimic the communications patterns of other force elements. For parts of the force, this may be critical to their survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The considerations outlined above present some serious challenges for an effective C2 architecture. First, some nodes may voluntarily withdraw themselves from the network, thereby severing pathways for information flow. Second, the adversary may deny certain pathways for periods of time or reduce bandwidth and increase latency of transmission, rendering kill chains unpredictable. Between friendly and adversary actions in the EMS, therefore, the risk is that a force expecting to have strong situational awareness will act in the belief that they have an up-to-date picture of the operating environment while lacking critical information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some technical and tactical requirements emerge out of this. Technically, it is necessary for a network to be built with the presumption that parts of it will not work optimally. In other words, rather than trying to build a completely assured architecture, it is better to have one that accepts that degradation is inevitable and degrades gracefully. Another requirement is that the system’s components can verify the latency at which it is operating and adjust prioritisation, routing and assessment accordingly. Third, it is vital that users understand whether they are operating with a current or degraded picture of the operating environment. A part of the force severed from blue force tracking, for example, has lost an advantage and the commander may expend resources to regain access to it. But it is critical that the commander knows that the connection has been disrupted rather than being forced to work this out only when the tactical situation confronting them differs from its representation on their technical systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tactically, resilience demands that control as to exposure and participation lies with the user. This may also mean that a commander decides to instruct part of a force to reduce its connectivity, either in terms of its lateral or vertical integration, to minimise its signature. Units may also make these decisions themselves, but the network structure must function for those that remain connected even as parts of the system withdraw from it. Here, it is necessary to conceptualise the EMS as a plane of manoeuvre and – like all manoeuvre – activity in this space must be proactively planned and reactively adapted to based on the tactical situation. A network structure that presumes a single configuration and linear degradation from it is likely to be overly centralised and too easy for adversaries to map and target. So, resilience should not be defined purely in terms of the difficulty of disrupting the network, but in the tactical options that the network architecture provides to commanders. A resilient system is one that can be configured based on mission requirements, rather than having system requirements constrain mission planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-a-straw-man-command-and-control-architecture&quot;&gt;II. A Straw-Man Command and Control Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveying the drivers outlined in the previous chapter, some basic propositions can be put forward that determine the contours of a future C2 architecture. These may be understood as the system’s requirements, but also its constraints. The challenge, in some instances, is to reconcile conflicting imperatives. In such cases, forces may vary in how they choose to reconcile these variables, but will need to mitigate the vulnerabilities they accept through tactics. This chapter considers the architecture supporting C2; the next chapter examines the practice of command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The propositions emerging from Chapter I may be outlined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Armies that achieve greater situational awareness will have a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Situational awareness is achieved by moving relevant data between both units at echelon and sensors and effectors to enable forces to converge their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data relevance must either be determined by pre-agreed prioritisation or by analysis conducted at higher echelon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latency in data transfer must be minimised for control of effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latency may be high for command of the force, but the picture must constitute as complete a data set as can be reasonably assembled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low-latency, high-bandwidth communications impose an unacceptable draw on power for most tactical units, which must support low-latency, low-bandwidth communications to maintain situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concentration of analytical capacity at higher echelons exposes the formation to an unacceptable degree of risk from long-range fires unless these elements can be dispersed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dispersion demands the automation of a significant proportion of headquarters tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automation demands a bearer-agnostic heterogeneous data ecosystem for the force, the remotely accessible nature of which also makes it vulnerable to cyber attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any future C2 architecture must degrade gracefully and in a predictable manner under constant disruption of the EMS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These propositions suggest that there are three processes with very different characteristics in play: command; control; and convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UYgnX4w.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Network Characteristics Against Functions.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing the distinct requirements of an appropriate communications architecture supporting each of these functions, it is possible to outline mature and emerging technologies that might be leveraged to deliver appropriate systems for future forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enabling-convergence-through-mobile-ad-hoc-networks&quot;&gt;Enabling Convergence Through Mobile Ad Hoc Networks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immense tactical value of a company net in which all soldiers in a formation can listen to a defined frequency, and those with transmitters can speak over it, should not be underestimated. The ability to provide situational awareness through passive monitoring, to coordinate actions where sections are beyond verbal range, and the capacity for commanders to clarify their tactical picture, all allow for a unit to adapt to overcome challenges in contact. There are some serious limitations, however, to traditional company nets. The fact that only one person can speak at a time limits the complexity of what can be managed. The pattern of transmission and receipt on such a system also allows the formation’s structure to be tracked in the EMS, allowing for the identification of command posts and support weapons. Furthermore, an attachment joining the company or transiting its battlespace cannot simply tune in to the network but must swap encryption keys with the company and, in doing so, must stop communicating on other frequencies. Thus, attachments like joint terminal attack controllers, tasked with communicating with aircraft, will be on a different net and be readily identifiable in the EMS. While this system worked well for the transmission of verbal instructions, it is not well suited to the ingestion, integration and dissemination of combat-relevant data. Militaries have sought to overcome some of these limitations with hub-and-spoke data management approaches, essentially using key elements of the network as data routers, analogous to a WiFi hub. The challenge with this is that it is limited in its flexibility and has single points of failure, both in terms of survivability and in terms of a bottleneck on routing and bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are technical solutions that are suited to the requirements of modern tactical formations, not least the mobile ad hoc network (MANET). A MANET is a network in which every connected device is also a router. As such, data can be routed dynamically in small packets through any and all available pathways around the network. This has several advantages. When someone authenticates themselves to join the MANET, they become an additional link in the chain, which can wrap around terrain. Because all communications are routed via multiple paths, nothing really stands out in the EMS. The size of each transmission is also reduced, leading to a wide area being covered in an electromagnetic haze, rather than having single points that have a clear behavioural pattern. Moreover, because all nodes are transmitting and receiving, it becomes possible to maintain accurate blue force tracking and to push information rapidly across the network or pull critical data from one point to another. Another critical advantage of a MANET is that it allows for the integration of the battlefield “Internet of Things”, enabling concepts like human–machine teaming. If a force places a sensor in a position, or if a vehicle is autonomously using its sensors to detect and classify objects, these can be shared across a MANET with human operators in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2SQucfD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: A MANET Wraps Around Terrain, Integrating People and Crewed and Uncrewed Systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations to MANETs. First, they place the responsibility for configuring and inputting the credentials to join the network on the end user, pushing a training burden to them. Second, MANETs rely on personnel being team players and passing data to others, which means that there is a continuous power draw on all active nodes, limiting endurance. Third, the routing protocols involved are complex and, as the network increases in size, there is a greater risk of it being corrupted or losing functionality. While MANETs may provide a good architecture to replace the company net, therefore, they do not offer a means to connect the whole force. MANETs should enable lateral data fusion within defined geographic boundaries, irrespective of the composition of the force joining the net, but they are a tactical system that is not suited to stitching echelons together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to rapidly fuse a common operating picture and transfer key information points from one point within a company and its attachments to another offers the kind of situational awareness called for in the previous chapter. If all troops are equipped with software-defined radios, this can be supported by a robust, frequency-hopping mesh against which adversary EW neither has critical identifiable nodes to focus precise effects on nor the agility to carry out blanket denial. Accessing the data available does present challenges. In those forces that have experimented and deployed these kinds of tools, the usual interface is a touch-screen tablet mounted on the chest. This must be robust. It can be difficult to use in high-glare environments, or in cold or CBRN environments where soldiers must keep gloves on. It also poses a risk from a light discipline point of view at night and requires a further draw on power. But these are surmountable problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the MANET allows lateral data transmission to provide the situational awareness necessary for convergence, the question arises as to how detections are to be offboarded to the relevant echelon. Although the two architectures for this method are described later, it is important to identify what should be offboarded. For those platforms with multiple mounted sensors and the ability to have the returns fused for ML interrogation, there should be the ability to disseminate an automatic identification onto the MANET, subject to a human operator’s confirmation of the detection. Thus, a symbol can be placed on a coordinate and this data disseminated via the MANET, either with a regularly updated live location if it remains under observation, or indicating a historical detection once contact is lost. Human operators who identify a target could have several options for generating a detection on the system. It would be possible to have a voice-activated command in some circumstances. Alternatively, it would be necessary to create an icon, identify the type of object and drop it on the relevant location, with the object automatically timestamped. This would be viable in a pre-contact situation. Once in contact, operators are likely to avoid focusing on a screen and would either need to use a voice command to the device or verbally announce the detection over the net, to be marked down by members of the company not in contact. The point is that the input at this point constitutes a tiny volume of data comprising the grid reference of the identification, the classification (Red, Green, Blue, White + Pax/IFV/MBT, etc.) and a timestamp for the detection. The same tiny data packet broadcast from each device at fixed intervals could provide live blue force tracking. Thus, offboarding target information does not need to be raw data but rather very small volumes. Some data that is required for key missions, such as radar detection of an air object, cannot function on a periodic basis. For this live track data – relevant only to key nodes such as those associated with air defence or with the ability to offboard data to higher echelons – must therefore be prioritised for transmission across the MANET, and this requires the protocol governing the network to have a built-in bandwidth prioritisation stack. The order of the priorities must reflect the structure of the force and where effectors are held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point about time stamping and the half-life of the relevance of detections is worth highlighting as a limitation of such a system. In practice, it would likely be wise to have two layers on the mapping application: one for current (within a defined period) and one for historic detections, with the ability to swipe back through time intervals. This may help to prevent multiple detections of the same unit over time creating the impression of a vast enemy force and other distortions, but there is no complete technological solution to this challenge. It is therefore crucial that operators of such a system are trained to interpret what they can access appropriately. The system may act as an invaluable guide but cannot be wholly trusted. This is especially true in a context where the network may be under EW attack and therefore not function consistently. The overall point is that while technology may enhance capabilities when appropriately exploited, operators must still retain tactical proficiency and use the technology as a force multiplier rather than a crutch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest concerns about a system like the one described above is what happens when a soldier is killed and their body overrun by the enemy or they are captured. First, there is a clear need to be able to rapidly disconnect from the MANET, requiring a re-entry of one’s credentials to reconnect. In the case of a dead soldier, it would be necessary for any member of the MANET to be able to eject others from the network. It is also possible that a soldier who is captured may divulge their credentials. We may assume that a soldier must have a radio with the right frequency settings and enter credentials to request to join the network. Thus, there is an immediate two-factor authentication. A third, however, must be used to guard against the case of a soldier captured with their equipment. Here, those already in the network being required to approve joining requests could suffice to secure the network’s integrity. This is especially critical because it is important that a user remain credentialled even when they stop receiving or transmitting data, or pause onward data transmission. There are tactical reasons as to why a force may switch to only receiving transmissions or go comms dark. It may be to conserve power, reduce their signature or simply be caused by a break in connection due to terrain. Re-credentialling must be managed on the basis of reconfirmation at intervals, rather than automatically if someone drops off the net, to prevent an unacceptably disruptive process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;exercising-control-through-the-kill-web&quot;&gt;Exercising Control Through the Kill Web&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latency between the detection and effect of targets, and the precision and accuracy of strikes, will largely determine lethality on the future battlefield. Moreover, strikes on key targets invariably require exquisite capabilities, whether to find or hit them, and these must be husbanded. So, this part of the force must be under tight, low-latency control. For this to occur, the relevant headquarters must have a detailed understanding of the environment and fuse the returns from stand-off detection directly under its command, wider collection from the force, and the provision of collection from national technical means to prioritise and coordinate effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two challenges: the structure of the fire control headquarters so that it is survivable within the projected threat environment, and the approach to getting the headquarters the relevant information while disseminating its instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to the process of moving the data, the best framework for understanding how such a network must operate is arguably the kill web. This is an evolution of the kill chain concept: the links by which target information must travel to complete a strike. The kill chain is judged by its efficiency (the fewest possible links) and latency (how quickly it can be completed). The kill web adds agility and therefore resilience to the concept by hypothesising that the information should move via the fastest available route, taking into account that certain routes may be denied at any given time. A further vital feature of the kill web is that although specific jumps within the web may be within line of sight, the end-to-end process is almost always beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working from the starting point of the previous section, where companies and their attachments’ own battlespace within which lateral communication of detections are transmitted over a MANET, the question becomes how to route the information picked up across the edge and held within these MANETs to the fire control headquarters. First, the fire control headquarters is not interested in all detections. They are interested in key targets, formations and feeds of track-quality actionable information. Defining what constitutes these priority information requirements must be coded into the mission data files that govern how the force’s network operates. If a detection marked as a priority in the mission data files, or data that is flagged as top priority at the edge, enters the system, it must be routed to the point in the MANET where it can be moved onto a different network for further transmission. It must be possible for data to pass between bearers, meaning the data management system should be bearer agnostic. So, the first requirement is that the kill web comprise a heterogeneous network: one that can pass data between operating systems and through different bearers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data can jump out of the MANET once it is at a point to be passed upwards. For example, suppose a British Army Wildcat helicopter entered a company’s operating area and applied to join the MANET. On doing so, it received a detection shared via the MANET of an enemy manoeuvre element preparing to apply pressure to the company’s flank. Here, the Wildcat took this information from the MANET and transferred it to Link-16, allowing the data to be relayed via blue aircraft to the Link-16 terminal in the fire control headquarters. The fire control headquarters could then either direct its own ISR to track the target to set up a fire mission or instruct the Wildcat to do so with its sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xRDOMxQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: The Kill Web.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incidental use of additional bearers is one means of strengthening the kill web. However, the company would also need organic means for transmitting data. Suppose that some vehicles in the company had free-space optical (FSO) transmitters and receivers and that the fire control headquarters maintained a relay UAV above the brigade rear to which FSO comms could be passed. Here, the same process would apply. A detection by the company would be automatically shared with the vehicles able to communicate via FSO as part of the lateral movement of information over the MANET. At this point, it would be transferred automatically to the FSO bearer and transmitter via the relay UAV to the fire control headquarters. Other members of the company might have high-frequency comms or SATCOM to relay back as a reversionary method, albeit with greater latency. Data could be channelled back through many potential pathways. Some detections, like aircraft tracks, need continuous updates and exceedingly low latency to be useful. Thus, there is a need for the prioritisation stack to account for these data requirements in the pathway prioritised when there are higher-and lower-latency paths available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also the case that while distributed sensors may provide non-track quality detections across the front, the fire control headquarters is also likely to have a range of standoff and stand-in sensors under its direct command. These would include capabilities like ground-moving target indicator (GMTI) and air defence radar, as well as longer-range penetrating UAVs. These units would likely have their own low-latency links to the fire control headquarters. Many of these sensors would be tasked to confirm high-priority targets. The fire control headquarters would also draw on data from higher echelons, including national technical means and space-based capabilities. The headquarters must be able to receive data from a wide range of sensor platforms and bearers, accumulating it from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reconnaissance reports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagery and synthetic aperture radar (SAR).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EW baselines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Radar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signals intelligence (SIGINT).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Common air picture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open source intelligence (OSINT)/metadata analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each case, the force would collect a very large volume of data that – if accumulated – could be plotted and mapped. AI, comparable to Project Maven, could sift each of these data sets separately, providing a classification, location and timestamp. With a team of operators monitoring each feed, these detections could then be fused with AI, cross-referencing the classification, location and timestamp to confirm detections and track them over time. For example, if SAR imagery from space confirmed the location of an air defence radar and a GMTI track then started from the location, it could be assessed that the GMTI track was the air defence radar in transit. Upon its going stationary, the system could verify the new position through SAR imagery interrogation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this process is achieved, it should be possible to maintain a map with several layers of detection, including live tracks, confirmed and previous detections, anomalies, and blue and green forces. The headquarters can run two fire control cells from this picture: one for reactive management of time-sensitive effects, including air defence and close-support fire missions, and a second responsible for planning proactive strikes. In total, therefore, assuming that each of the functions described requires processing power, work stations, and a team to liaise with the units supplying the data, assessing and verifying the AI’s conclusions, the fire control headquarters could fit into 10 vehicle-mounted ISO containers with seven additional vehicles: one carrying a generator and fuel, one with the headquarters’ real-life support, one signals vehicle carrying fibre optic cables to connect the headquarters elements, two transmitters and two receiver masts, able to be set up at a distance from the headquarters. Held at operational depth, the ability to conceal such an arrangement appears eminently feasible. Consider, for example, a group of lorries in a requisitioned supermarket depot or a group of shipping containers. Alternatively, the headquarters could be set up in subterranean working cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analytical structure’s survivability can be compromised if it emits on a wide range of frequencies. However, the architecture described above envisages the headquarters receiving information on a wide range of bearers but transmitting separately. Transmissions to shooters – completing the kill web – may be divided into lower- and higher-latency sequences. The former demand almost instantaneous direction. This is best achieved with a low probability of detection (LPD) transmission to a relay and down to the battery. Higher-latency activity, like setting up a complex long-range strike, could be distributed via masked satellite uplink. There are a range of options when it comes to the bearer. The point is that it is possible to offset transmissions from the headquarters via fibre optic cable to a transmitter displaced from the headquarters’ location, and then to make those transmissions exceedingly hard to detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in a capacity to draw detections from across the force rapidly via the kill web to a concealable and survivable headquarters, able to obscure its own emissions traffic, and thereby optimally control fires across the force. The use of AI to enable small teams to scrape vast quantities of data, and for these different sets of detections to be fused, should enable the fastest means of coordinating a wide range of both detections and effects. By understanding the range of kinetic and non-kinetic fires being applied, the fire control headquarters may also issue warnings or orders to units so that they can exploit the impact or take appropriate countermeasures, like bringing down UAVs above their battlespace for the window of time when friendly air is traversing it. In Ukraine, for example, the US XVIII Airborne Corps headquarters could determine whether Russian forces were about to conduct counterbattery or preparatory fires using space-based collection and route these warnings to Ukrainian tactical groups in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is these considerations that make proactive and reactive fire control distinct functions, as individuals working out these elements of a strike will be working at a different tempo to an air defence coordination cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although what is described above is highly centralised, some responsibilities could be delegated. For example, if guns were assigned as close-support artillery to a battalion, it would be reasonable for the headquarters to auto-clear approvals for assigned fire missions between the supported and supporting element. Thus, if the battalion loaded a detection onto their MANET and called for fire against it, this request would be routed through the kill web directly to the guns. But this should not be the normal route. First, it denies the headquarters information about the battlefield. Second, tactical echelons are at a higher risk of false positives if they are sensing beyond line of sight, as they have fewer sensor layers to compare. Third, for more capable munitions, of which there are limited stocks, tactical echelons are unlikely to know what is not yet in contact but moving towards them. Nor will tactical echelons fully grasp the severity of their position as compared with others and will therefore expend valuable munitions sub-optimally if given fire control over them. Thus, while appropriate for guns in close support, a centralised fusion process will usually lead to the best results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhancing-command-through-the-combat-cloud&quot;&gt;Enhancing Command Through the Combat Cloud&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The functions of command are very different from the tight and time-bound exercising of control described above, and it does not make sense for command processes to be integrated with control mechanisms. Command is primarily concerned with determining the objectives for units, planning their activity and leading subordinates so that they have the confidence to execute their assigned tasks. If fire control is driven by the need for tempo, command is much more intimately concerned with timing. For example, if a commander decides to send a unit from A to B, their transit will take a fixed amount of time irrespective of how quickly the commander can make decisions. The relevant question, therefore, is whether the decision to relocate the unit was made at the appropriate time, not how quickly it was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important distinction between the processes is that fire control often concerns complicated tasks with lots of precise elements, but the tasks themselves are discrete and readily understandable. Command largely concerns complex tasks, in which a commander must 1) devise a logic to defeat the enemy while the adversary is also in motion and 2) communicate this to subordinates so they can improvise their activities without impeding the overall scheme. This requires more information to be assessed than simply where the enemy is and that information sent to subordinates articulates intent and context rather than just providing a set of instructions. Finally, and in some respects most importantly, the commander holds reserves and supporting capabilities, and they must determine when these resources are expended against what effort. It is important that commanders do not get sucked into the continuous and high-pressure task of exercising control. When they do this, it usually removes them from the place where they can maintain sufficient contextual awareness and analytical detachment to exercise effective judgement. A commander sucked into controlling their force is liable to be led by the nose, or to commit resources against the problem that currently commands their attention, rather than anticipating the problem ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows that the communications architecture for command differs from the requirements for exercising control. It is worth considering what must be communicated. First, commanders will wish to distribute orders, summarising what they are asking their subordinates to do – when, where and against what anticipated opposition – and determining the resources available to the subordinate implementing the orders. Second, a commander will wish to provide intelligence support relevant to the operations. This may include schematics of target buildings, assessments of what the enemy is anticipated to be doing rather than just what they are doing now, and contextual information for the subordinate as to their surroundings. Working up these plans takes time. Commanders are not continuously transmitting orders. However, these packages may comprise quite large volumes of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commander also requires key information to conduct their planning. They must have a reasonable picture of the battlefield, including the status and position of friendly units and the known and assessed locations of enemy units and what they are trying to do. They need their own orders, require an accurate picture of their supply situation and must be able to feel their troops’ morale. This creates an interesting set of architectural challenges. Commanders must circulate the battlefield as leading requires face-to-face engagement. To exercise judgement, they not only need information to be accumulated; it must be presented to them in a comprehensible manner and they should have time to consider the issue. Their decision-making tempo is therefore likely to be inconsistent, and the location from which they may need to exercise judgement is also not fixed. Another interesting aspect is that those receiving the orders require time to understand them, and this interaction is not a constant activity but likely one dependent on their availability based on the tactical situation and conducted at intervals. The fact that a commander must be mobile, but their large, dispersed staff cannot accompany them, creates a requirement for information to be transmitted and received at irregular intervals, and ideally for the recipient to determine when they receive the information and the sender to determine when they send it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communications architecture that arguably best supports such a system is the combat cloud, the concept of a remotely accessible data repository. Access to that repository could be achieved through a range of means, but satellite communication would offer a high-bandwidth, medium-latency, dependable, maskable and resilient way of uploading information to a shared environment and downloading it. Access to information within the cloud would need to be compartmentalised according to the authorities and permissions of the individual accessing it, and the individual would need to prove their credentials to access the information within their compartment. Nevertheless, such a system would allow components of a staff to produce their annexes while working in separation, for this to be downloaded and cohered by the principal planning group, uploaded, and distributed to subordinate units. It would also be possible to push supporting data like relevant imagery, mapping or J2 assessments forwards with these orders packs. For the forces required to implement these orders, they could be downloaded when a unit commander has the opportunity to access the repository. Once the data is brought onto the commander’s computer, associated layers of mapping, arrows and times could be distributed over the MANET to be available on each soldier’s interface. Such a model allows different parts of the headquarters to be situated at any distance, including support functions in the home base. The robustness of this approach has been demonstrated in Ukraine through the use of Starlink terminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the personalisation of briefing annexes to orders would have been impossible for a staff because of the time required as compared to the staff available. However, most of the data for generating these kinds of personalised information packs is generated collaterally during planning. Converting that data into packs is a feasible task for AI, ensuring that a commander’s intent is translated into clear visual instructions at each echelon, with the supporting written orders available to understand the “what” and the “why”. The mechanisms for this are already visible with ChatGPT when it is used appropriately under supervision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flowing in the other direction, the higher latency with which the headquarters needs to accumulate data to inform planning as compared with the short timeframes necessary for effective control can also allow reports and raw material to be uploaded when there is slack capacity in the network to avoid saturating the net. Thus, the headquarters should be able to accumulate a continuous stream of information from the battlefield, albeit with some lag between collection and receipt that would differ depending on the intensity of activity at the tactical edge. It is also reasonable to assume that the headquarters would be passed information from the fire control headquarters’ fusion cell as and when there was slack capacity on the kill web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6ACW7wf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Integrating the Three Networks.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a tangible example of how this system could work, consider a logistics unit of four trucks waiting in a hide. They check in to the combat cloud via a satellite link at an agreed interval and receive an order to move to a cache position and pick up four shipping containers containing combat loads for a forward element and fuel. The most direct route to the caches’ location is attached to the orders and automatically populates onto the tactical interface in the vehicles. The logistics packet closes the satellite link and leaves its hide, reaching the cache and scanning a QR code on the shipping containers as they are drawn onto the trucks. The commander then reconnects via satellite to upload the time and place with the shipping container’s serial number and begins their route to the handover point with the element they are supporting. A pair of reconnaissance vehicles that had been simultaneously tasked with moving to the front join the packet as it moves forwards, having similarly received instructions. On entering the battlespace owned by the unit they are tasked with resupplying, the logistics group would request to join the MANET, indicating its presence and connecting to coordinate a point to cache the material. Once this was indicated by the receiving unit, the logs group could proceed to the coordinates that the unit commander marked on their tactical interface and cache the pallets from their containers. Following this, the logistics element could scan the QR code on the container, picking up its location, status and timestamp, and attach an indication that the load was now empty, distributing this over the MANET to the unit commander so that they know the supplies are cached and ready to be retrieved. At the same time, the situation report (SITREP) would enter the priority stack in the MANET to be uploaded to the combat cloud when a connection and bandwidth became available, so that the operational headquarters would receive confirmation of mission success and an update on the unit’s supply status. This would also indicate that the logistics element was available for tasking again. Because the cache point would be distributed across the MANET, units would know that protecting this point was important. So, attached elements like counter-unmanned aircraft system operators could have the knowledge to converge their activities to keep the area out of enemy observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-changing-practice-of-command&quot;&gt;III. The Changing Practice of Command&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architectures in the previous chapter have continuities and differences when compared with the existing communications that land forces use. Because the differences directly connect parts of the force that would have previously been separate, command relationships that would have been manifestly inefficient before are created. The consequences can be positive or negative depending on how the culture of command interacts with these opportunities. This chapter, therefore, seeks to outline some of the changes in behaviour and mindset that are necessary to exploit the system’s potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;command-discipline&quot;&gt;Command Discipline&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure outlined above effectively breaks down the echelon structure as regards C2, as it becomes possible for the operational headquarters to issue direct orders to any part of the force while the force can call for effects from the fire control headquarters. Whereas the current hierarchical communications architecture would require orders at division to be disseminated to commanders, staffs and subordinates in that order, the outlined architecture would enable the division to issue orders to any required level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is dangerous. Suppose, for example, that the divisional commander feels uncomfortable with a gap in collection in the battlespace. Under the old architecture, an instruction to prioritise collection against this area would lead the staff to assess what assets remained uncommitted. Then, they would either task them or instruct a subordinate commander responsible for the battlespace containing the gap to adapt their dispositions. It would be for the subordinate to balance their responsibilities, and if they felt that covering the gap would endanger their existing instructions, they could ask the divisional commander for more resource or clarification of intent as regards the balance of risk to be taken and the prioritisation of tasks. Meanwhile, none of these deliberations would be known to the reconnaissance units being discussed who could therefore continue to focus on their assigned tasks. By contrast, it would be entirely possible under the new system for the divisional commander to see the laydown of the reconnaissance troops, select a unit and issue it orders to shift focus. This would solve the commander’s problem – apparently improving efficiency – without the reconnaissance troops’ commanding officer being aware of what their subordinates are now doing or why. Moreover, having insight into the tactical fight risks higher headquarters becoming obsessed by and drawn into tactical issues, losing focus on the operational questions that should be their area of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ability to reach around echelons is necessary because a strictly hierarchical C2 architecture is vulnerable and would not facilitate efficient data movement. However, it risks being disruptive without appropriate discipline from commanders. Another aspect of this risk is that it is entirely possible for a senior commander to saturate the force’s capacity. The fidelity of modern sensing should mean that an operational commander can get almost any question they ask about the physical disposition of enemy forces answered. However, this will likely draw on a range of assets whose returns must now be prioritised by the network and which are likely unavailable to carry out other tasks. It would therefore be easy for a commander to demand collection against too many targets and, in doing so, saturate the network and exhaust the available assets. Again, the risk is that the higher staff begins to interfere with the planning and execution of these activities to optimise them and becomes drawn into tactical decision-making to answer tactical questions. The question of how good a spectator the commander is arises as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used properly, the architecture described above offers significant benefits. For example, suppose a commander, through higher echelon collection, observes that the enemy is planning on thrusting a wedge along the unit boundary between two subordinate formations. First, the higher headquarters can pass this information to the subordinates, giving them the situational awareness to account for the threat. Second, the commander now faces a decision point as to whether to deploy reserves to bolster the sector or commit other assets like attack aviation to blunt the threat, thereby directly supporting the subordinate formation. Most importantly, understanding the supply status and disposition of friendly and hostile forces, the commander can plan what to do after the immediate set of fights. Ensuring that the opportunities the command architecture presents are appropriately supported demands training and the development of a culture of command that distinguishes between and separates out command from control, so that officers do not feel the need to exercise control to be in command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;disaggregated-collaboration&quot;&gt;Disaggregated Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architecture described in the previous chapter is intended to make command, not control, agnostic of distance to ensure survivability. Within this, it is eminently feasible for information from the battlefield to be aggregated in the homeland, fused with national collection and made available to the operational headquarters’ J2 shop. The latter may be working across two or three concealed locations (like underground car parks) in the corps rear and used to form briefing packs addressing the allocated commander’s information requirements. These might then be uploaded from the J2 cell and downloaded by the J3/5 cell in another location before being attached as annexes to the courses of action presented to the commander and their principal planning group, who might be in a mobile command post of two or three vehicles, carrying out battlefield circulation. This is not an optimal way of working and creates several frictions. Getting everyone on the same video teleconference at regular intervals is also likely to be unviable under this architecture. While it may be possible at irregular intervals depending on the situation, it cannot be relied on. The driver for this disaggregation is survivability, not efficiency. Nevertheless, as was demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic, such an approach is feasible even if not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges in disaggregated working is that when a system has an uneven and potentially disrupted tempo, it is possible for parts of the structure to be bypassed or forgotten. Suppose, for example, that a commander has an incidental question about something in their briefing pack relating to the enemy’s assessed intent. If the headquarters was physically co-located, the J2 cell would likely field this question. However, if contacting the J2 cell requires submitting a question via technological means, and there is a lag in their receiving the request and answering, then in many instances the inclination will be for the command group to use their best judgement and move on without consulting them at all. Here, there is a risk for the J2 cell that the absence of questions suggests an absence of demand: if the team goes quiet under this assumption, they will receive fewer requests over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overcoming the risk of progressive isolation requires an entrepreneurial culture in staffs and across the force. This is very different to mission command, which concerns the ability to continue pursuing a commander’s stated intent despite an absence of supervision or control. Entrepreneurialism is a capacity to examine the situation and determine what is to be done in the absence of clear direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relevance here is that a part of the C2 architecture may have fulfilled its role in the process and delivered against intent. The question then becomes “what can this component do to further the work of others, to strengthen their situational awareness, bolster their capacity and remain connected?”. The post most likely to be disrupted by this process is the chief of staff, as they can no longer function as an orchestra conductor. Instead, they become more like a jazz band’s sound technician, balancing the levels to ensure that all components align.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trust-in-the-machine&quot;&gt;Trust in the Machine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of drawing one’s commands from the cloud, compiled by a disaggregated staff spread throughout operational depth, risks making it profoundly impersonal. Moreover, although staff at higher echelon may have a high-fidelity picture of the battlefield, they are separated from its texture. The risk is that subordinates come to distrust their superiors’ decisions, feeling a lack of connection and the absence of shared risk. Battlefield circulation may help, but ensuring the continuity of trust also requires that subordinates who feel they need clarification or additional engagement regarding instructions can reach for it. Knowing that this is possible in itself likely alleviates the need for its use, but commanders and staffs must be empathetic to the personal connection that underpins trust between those in harm’s way and those directing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trust issue is even more important when it comes to AI. Trust in AI is eminently possible. How often, for instance, do people independently corroborate that Citymapper and other route planning services actually offer the optimal course of action? The AI uses described in this paper – including route planning and the generation of staff work, bandwidth and data prioritisation, and sensor data fusion – all offer a substantial increase in efficiency but only if users trust these systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are barriers to this trust in a military context, including the consequences of failure and the unreliability of connectivity (and thus the available data on which a system is basing judgements). Theorists have also put forward unrealistic expectations, such as the need to be able to understand how an AI is making judgements, or the idea of having a human in the loop. The former is not possible because of the training burden involved. The latter defeats the whole purpose of the efficiency gains achievable through AI. There are some processes where a human must exercise judgement, but there are many where they may observe and only interfere if they judge there to be something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of trust can be managed in two ways. First, there is a need for AI tools to have a very specific purpose and for the outcome to be something that the operator can judge the success of. They need not understand how a result was reached, but if the result is clear then its accuracy will build confidence and the ability to perceive inaccuracy will also reassure. For planning purposes, this does require effective training for users as to what problems a particular AI tool will be effective at and how it is to be used. To take ChatGPT as an example, it can be a very useful tool if used properly for certain tasks. It can also prove highly misleading when used inappropriately for other tasks or if it is assigned to the wrong one. Training staff on employing these tools is important if they are to avoid having their confidence in the system damaged. A second requirement is that AI tools degrade gracefully and transparently. That is to say that when dependencies are not available, the user must be made aware that the tool is now functioning in a degraded state and understand how this may alter its use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trust issue relating to the architecture described in this paper is that of assurance. Cyber attacks are a constant threat and, when combined with EW, are liable to suppress, disrupt and potentially compromise parts of any architecture. If the user comes to believe that their system is compromised or has been interfered with, their confidence in it will collapse, which could have a negative effect on the system’s functioning that is entirely disproportionate to the actual direct consequences of a compromise or penetration. An organisation therefore needs to be actively protected by cyber defence specialists. It is also important that staff understand the scale and persistence of attacks on the network so that they do not expect a perfectly secure system, but rather a sufficiently secure and robust one to be depended on even if there are occasional disruptions. This requires a shift in how security is understood from something absolute to something partial. Establishing unrealistic expectations risks a breakdown of trust in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ems-as-a-plane-of-manoeuvre&quot;&gt;The EMS as a Plane of Manoeuvre&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacy approaches to C2 tend to view signals as a support function, to have a primary mode of communication and to revert to a series of less efficient but more assured methods depending on the level of enemy interference. Furthermore, the instinct has been to minimise transmission to maintain concealment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has essentially argued that the level of sensor fidelity on the modern battlefield makes concealment a highly temporary state. The extent to which being detected exposes a force to risk depends on whether the enemy can manoeuvre the information to the relevant effector and the confidence of their identification of the detection. This can be combated with EW and constraining the relevance of the information through displacement. However, both of these actions have an associated signature, which perpetuates the enemy having sensor returns on the formation. The force best able to share its information will ultimately have a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further proposition in this paper has been that communications must be assured; not through a sequential PACE (Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency) stack, but through bearer-agnostic data transfer to evade interference. Frequency hopping for line-of-sight communications can achieve this at the tactical level. For the kill web, using a range of different bearer pathways can help to achieve this. For the combat cloud, survivability is achieved by removing the requirement for both parties to be connected at the same time, thereby temporally evading disruption. It is nevertheless likely that an adversary can disrupt elements of these networks for limited periods of time, albeit at a significant cost in resource. In this context, the EMS must be understood as a manoeuvre environment – one that is actively contested and through which each side tries to assure its own links while denying the enemy’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regards the culture of command, these dynamics require a commander to articulate when and where they wish to prioritise the resources of their signals troops and where they determine the balance in utility between assured communication and signature management. Perhaps most importantly, a commander should not assume that a force will function on EMCON black – without comms – until in contact or on primary communications until this channel is disrupted. The former risks the force being severed from situational awareness and therefore being outmanoeuvred. The latter risks the force being shaped and targeted as its comms plan degrades through a predictable series. Instead, the assumption should be that the force will communicate dynamically, manage active disruption and try to preserve ambiguity rather than concealment as to its dispositions. The concentration of EW effects or shifting to EMCON black may provide a period where the enemy loses understanding of the battlefield and therefore achieves a shaping effect that may offer advantage. Similarly, if the force is dominating the other, then it can likely increasingly shift to a steady state of communications comparable to primary comms. Within this context, it is important that signals troops are involved in developing the scheme of manoeuvre and can advise on the options available to a commander as to when certain effects can be applied and when risk must be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final element in understanding the EMS as a plane of manoeuvre is in using the tools described in this paper as a force multiplier rather than a crutch. Situational awareness offers competitive advantage, but access to it will be disrupted. Troops can devote effort to improving access, but if they lack it, it is critical that they do not stop operating in anticipation of its return. Instead, they must revert to appropriate tactics in periods of limited connectivity. It is this skill that offers the force resilience. Resilience is not about having a perfect system that operates optimally all the time; rather, it reflects the capacity for operators to maximise a system’s utility when it is operating imperfectly. This increased signals literacy likely creates a force generation challenge. An increased number of signallers at tactical echelons, however, offers troops both situational awareness in the EMS, and the means to fight for connectivity. The move of signallers from a support function to a key part of the combined arms manoeuvre system also requires an adjustment to culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past 30 years, almost all military concepts have aspired to bring data to the battlefield. Concepts like network-centric operations and systems confrontation warfare have emphasised targeting enemy networks to secure advantage. At the same time, programmes like the US’s Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or Russia’s striving to build a unified digital fire control architecture through Akatsiya, are all premised on mass data fusion and dissemination around the force. But the lived experience of operations has been rather different. In Afghanistan, in the absence of a contested EMS, it took years to give troops full motion video from their supporting UAVs. Data fusion was achieved through the deployment of hundreds of analysts to combat theatres. Actually deployed in combat, meanwhile, Russia has found its operators unable to employ its modern communications systems proficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a significant gap between theory and practice. This is not to say that communications have not improved over this period, but rather that the fielding of new communications equipment has been laborious, uneven and often resulted in a like-for-like replacement of older systems, with the force slowly adapting to exploit its potential. For example, 3 UK Division headquarters has a Link-16 terminal, largely used by its air defenders. However, while data from this terminal could be an invaluable source of situational awareness from a range of air assets, it is rarely integrated into wider targeting and planning cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper did not aim to provide a technical evaluation of the range of ongoing attempts to modernise parts of military communications. Instead, it has posited a set of drivers and the architectural responses to seizing the available opportunities that modern technology offers while mitigating emerging risks. One clear conclusion is that there is not one architecture; instead, there are at least three, differentiated by how data enters, is prioritised and moved within the system. Furthermore, the function of command is distinct from the exercising of control and requires a different architecture. A third requirement is to maximise situational awareness laterally between tactical echelons so that subordinates exercising mission command can dynamically converge effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separating out the functions simplifies network requirements in a way that makes it possible to fulfil them using technologies that are already mature. The three architectures identified in this paper (MANETs supporting tactical formations, a heterogeneous kill web for control of the fires system, and a combat cloud for the command of the force) are all realisable. However, establishing such a system requires adjustment to training and culture in how command is exercised. Commanders must be more disciplined and avoid interfering where the system gives them access to tactical activity. Headquarters must become better at disaggregated collaboration and being entrepreneurial, not work to a rigid tempo. Trust must be established between the AI support tools required to make this system work and the personnel employing them. This means staff officers need to be trained in how to leverage these tools and understand how they can be misused. It also requires AI tools to be closely tied to achieving specified outputs that can be understood, even if the AI’s workings cannot. The force must also be able to trust the resilience and assurance of the network even as it is contested, through graceful degradation and appropriate training to operate without strong connectivity. This requires active cyber defence. It also demands a more manoeuvrist approach to understanding the EMS, appreciating that interference is likely continuous and an issue to be actively combated, rather than an imposition triggering predictable procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significantly reduced C2 footprint and increased survivability are possible if the architectures described in this paper are realised. Situational awareness would likely also significantly increase the ability of the force’s components to act as force multipliers to one another, even while operating in a dispersed posture. Finally, a force using such an architecture would be able to maximise the effectiveness of its fires and maintain a high-fidelity sensor picture of the battlefield, leveraging sensor density across modern militaries. What is described is eminently possible; the question is whether forces have the agility in their procurement processes to seize the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;何桂藍談議會無用仍參選：意義做咗都未必搵得到，但唔做就一定搵唔到&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/F332rkt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（26日）踏入審訊第92天。何桂藍繼續作供，就立法會既然無法審議和倡議，「到底選立法會嚟做咩」，何坦言答不到，直到看到61萬的初選投票數字。何指在法律場合或許每件事都「有原因有結果有過程有動機」，但政治行動不是跟從此邏輯，「簡單嚟講就係意義呢家嘢，做咗都未必搵得到，但唔做就一定搵唔到。」何亦曾於街站指港人抗爭開啟了歷史變革的可能，她解釋2019年運動後，港人明白追求民主「冇可能永遠都安全，係一定會有代價」、無法迴避香港已無可能維持現狀的事實，亦意識到不能單靠領袖要自己「落場」貢獻，何認為比起大國博弈或地緣政治，這些人心的改變「先至真正令到變革有可能發生」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何亦認為初選意義是不論勝算或會否DQ，仍投選最認同的路線，若政府大規模DQ便「無異於宣稱香港嘅選舉其實同伊朗都冇乜分別」。何又形容，中共要香港走入「鳥籠式民主」，透過選舉吸納民意和民間政治能量，將港人困在無出路亦無法改變的體制內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指現時審核制度自殖民地起使用-2019運動要改革整個制度&quot;&gt;何指現時審核制度自殖民地起使用 2019運動要改革整個制度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供，甫開庭主動表示，就法官李運騰昨問「審議又唔得、倡議又唔得，到底選立法會嚟做咩呢」的問題有補充和更正。李運騰昨曾問何桂藍，若認為議會無法正常議事、無法影響政府政策，那她期望議員入立法會做什麼，何當時回應可用非常僅餘權力指出政府法案的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何今先指昨日曾稱有些文件或資訊「係做立法會議員先攞得到」，說法並非錯誤，但只佔很少部分。何並補充，一直以來所討論很有問題的財政審核制度，「其實由1840年代用到而家㗎喇」，而議員提私人草案必須先經特首批准的做法，1997年前亦已存在，只是「特首」換成「總督」，簡單而言現時仍在用的制度設計，「本身係畀一個殖民地用嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指，因此2019年運動「從來都唔係爭取入到立法會做啲咩，或者立法會做到啲咩，而係要改革成個制度」，並指不止改革立法會，如雙普選就是指行政和立法機關也要普選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指直至看到投票人數始知初選意義意義做咗未必搵到唔做一定搵唔到&quot;&gt;何指直至看到投票人數始知初選意義：意義做咗未必搵到、唔做一定搵唔到&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「講到立法會乜用都冇，但仍然去選立法會係為乜」，正正是很多2020年時覺得「投初選冇意思、唔肯投初選」的人的問題。何續說，「好老實講，我相信喺2020年冇一個民主派嘅人士可以圓滿咁樣答到呢個問題」，而「我自己最老實嘅答案，你問我2020年搞咗半年搞咁多嘢為乜，其實我係答唔到嘅，直到我見到61萬（初選投票人數）呢個數字，呢一個就係當時根本冇人想像得到會出現嘅局面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續表示：「可能喺法律嘅場合，就係每樣嘢都好清晰，有原因有結果有過程有動機，但係政治行動唔係跟呢啲 logic 行嘅」，她提高了聲線：「簡單嚟講就係意義呢家嘢，做咗都未必搵得到，但唔做就一定搵唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱2019開啟歷史變革-港人知追求民主有代價無法迴避不可維持現狀事實&quot;&gt;何稱2019開啟歷史變革 港人知追求民主有代價、無法迴避不可維持現狀事實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就何桂藍7月11日的大圍街站發問。謄本顯示何桂藍提到現時面對非常嚴峻的打壓，但「我哋嘅抗爭亦都開啟咗真正歷史性變革嘅可能性」，Beel 問是什麼變革。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋有三點，認為經過2019年後，「全香港嘅人會有一個意識係，追求民主冇可能永遠都安全，係一定會有代價嘅」，而且2019年後，「冇人可以再扮睇唔到香港嘅問題，就算佢唔參與運動，都無辦法迴避香港已經冇可能維持現狀嘅呢個事實。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又重申，2019年運動令很多人意識到，無法再靠一個領袖或者代表，「佢必須要自己落場，搵到自己嘅方式去貢獻場運動」。何指，比起大家常討論的大國博弈、歷史性機遇或地緣政治，「我個人認為，我頭先所講嘅嗰啲人心上嘅改變，先至真正令到變革有可能發生。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上播何桂藍大圍街站片-稱參選不因相信制度而是相信港人不會棄與極權對抗&quot;&gt;庭上播何桂藍大圍街站片 稱參選不因相信制度而是相信港人不會棄與極權對抗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後問 Beel 片段有多長，控方稱有39分鐘。陳慶偉說「我想看」，並指因何有談及戴耀廷，何即挨後椅背雙手攤開呈無奈狀。辯方早休後播放片段，除何桂藍外，亦有岑敖暉、王宗堯、朱凱廸、鄺頌晴、周庭、何韻詩和黃耀明發言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍提及，有選民指看到羅冠聰離港感心痛，猶豫應否投票，「擔心咁樣係咪送我哋去死」，惟何指《國安法》下，無論運動哪個崗位也面對一樣危險，但「我哋由2019年嘅6月，我哋就一齊決咗志，做咗一個決定，就係無論如何都要同所有香港人一齊行落去」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，今次初選有三個重要意義，包括讓國際社會看到香港仍有多少人無懼國安法出來投票；送盡量多進步派、抗爭派入議會帶來真正改變；及在白色恐怖年代以可見的政治行動互相支援同路人。何並指，投票率是世界上共通語言，雖然香港從無真正民主選舉，但投票率是最好指標讓國際社會看到香港人頑強反抗意志。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續提及，若最後勝出初選的仍是不斷與選民講有35+就可落實訴求、或議會仍可有議政空間的人，「其實係乜嘢都冇改變到」；又指中共一直為香港寫好的劇本，「就係要香港一步一步咁樣走入鳥籠式嘅民主」，但港人抗爭行動打破了中共設立的「死局」，她參選不是因仍相信制度，而是相信香港人，無論面對多大危難也不會放棄與極權對抗，「與其我哋接受一個毫無未來嘅死局，點解我哋唔博一個未知嘅未來。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何解釋初選意義-是不論勝算或dq仍投選最認同的路線&quot;&gt;何解釋初選意義 是不論勝算或DQ仍投選最認同的路線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問及何提到「乜嘢都冇改變到」的意思，何指7月中的討論已去到如果支持的候選人有非常高的被DQ風險，「咁你仲投唔投佢好呢」，因一直以來大家在選舉的慣性，就是要投勝算高的候選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何認為，「我哋就係說服佢哋違背呢個慣性」，即使明知支持的候選人很有可能被DQ，「都要喺初選照投佢」，因初選「去到嗰個位已經唔淨止係選出最強隊伍參與9月選舉」；又解釋《國安法》宣布後很多人擔心會取消正式選舉，故初選意義就變成「喺大家仲有得投票嘅時候，唔好諗佢最後嘅勝算、或者佢仲有冇得選，但係都要投你最認同嘅路線，投你最支持嘅人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，如在此前提下，仍是對35+有幻想的人勝出初選，即是代表香港人「選擇咗繼續停留喺佢哋以往對於立法會或者對於香港嘅幻想入面，咁就乜嘢都改變唔到㗎喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指制度透過選舉吸納民意及民間政治能量-使港人困在無法改變的體制內&quot;&gt;何指制度透過選舉吸納民意及民間政治能量 使港人困在無法改變的體制內&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後問及「鳥籠式民主」的意思，何指很多人對民主理解是一人一票、有論壇、選完後可「同啲官有問有答」，但何認為真正的民主是談及「成套制度」，舉例澳門也有選舉，但不代表真的可令民意影響政府施政和決策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「香港人一直都有票投，但係我哋對於呢個城市嘅規劃、個發展，對於公共開支到底點樣洗，我地有冇 say 呢？好明顯就係冇嘅。即係話佢（政權）透過選舉去吸納民意、同吸納民間嘅政治能量，然後將佢（香港人）困咗喺一個根本冇出路亦都冇辦法帶來改變嘅 institution（體制）入面」，而何說「一步一步咁樣走入」，是因「過去好多年嚟我哋一直討論點樣擴大個民主成分⋯⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭傳譯主任一度未能翻譯，何桂藍主動提議譯作「to improve how democratic the system is」，指相信 Beel 明白。法官陳慶偉亦指「我們全都明白」，認為何是說被困在現行制度的四面牆內，又指當然明白有方法改善現行民主制度。何欲繼續回答，並表示：「但係而家（回答）係斷咗章嘅，我完埋⋯⋯」惟陳慶偉打斷說「Thank you」，何提高聲量邊疊聲邊繼續：「但係擴大民主成分唔等於民主咗嘅，完喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於就何提及更多抗爭派入議會，「抗爭到底」，何指是「去到佢可以抗爭嘅最後一刻⋯⋯可能係畀人拉，或者畀人DQ、冇咗個議席」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何估計若大規模dq會完全改變選舉遊戲規則觸發憲政危機&quot;&gt;何估計若大規模DQ會完全改變選舉遊戲規則、觸發憲政危機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後展示何桂藍初選投票後，於7月14日的 Facebook 帖文〈從61萬到200萬的距離〉，配圖為「初選出線感言」，提及：「接下來，不論面對怎樣的打壓、有多少人被DQ、由何人延續，抗爭派最重要的任務，是繼續說服溫和派選民，為何要利用立法會選舉，觸發憲政危機。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋若仍有選舉，取得最大票數就是很明確反對《國安法》的民意，並指7至8月時，大家仍觀望DQ規模有多大，而她當時認為「其實只要有DQ，哪怕只要DQ一個，場選舉已經係唔公平嘅選舉喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指如只DQ很少數人，因過去數年選舉都是這樣，大家已習慣了，民眾很快就會將焦點轉回「繼續為餘下嘅民主派候選人爭取議席」上；惟如果民眾對抗爭派的支持非常大，何估計北京和港府便會選擇大規模DQ候選人，「咁呢樣嘢就係一個各方都未見過嘅東西，無論係本地嘅選民或者當時關注緊嘅傳媒都會認為係有相當嘅震撼性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「政府如果選擇大規模DQ、大規模篩選嘅話，其實就無異於宣稱香港嘅選舉其實同伊朗都冇乜分別㗎喇」，會造成合法性危機，並指當時觀察有溫和派選民想避免這些事情發生，而何希望說服他們。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，何指的憲政危機是指DQ抑或建制的反應。何解釋如大規模DQ二十多三十人、甚至更多，「咁佢哋就好難宣稱呢個DQ純粹係因為唔同候選人個人嘅政治理念，而好明顯係針對香港民主派嘅打壓」，而她形容為「憲政危機」，是因「佢完全改變咗立法會選舉嘅遊戲規則㗎喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇提盡力試文攻武鬥-何用盡書面質詢權力被阻止仍堅持提出主張&quot;&gt;論壇提盡力試「文攻武鬥」 何：用盡書面質詢權力、被阻止仍堅持提出主張&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方今亦就何桂藍7月9日 Facebook 發布的片段提問，何指是她7月初出席將軍澳居民統籌的新東地區論壇片段，她節錄部分問答發布。被問議會中的行動路線，何提及過往很多「文攻武鬥」，但民主派議員或未「做盡」，舉例除陳志全和區諾軒外，其他議員提修正案數量未如理想，並指議會內仍有空間嘗試「文攻武鬥」，「我會盡力嘗試。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問何即是會做什麼。何指以她理解，當時的確有民主派議員覺得「反正入咗 CSA（修正案）都畀（時任立法會主席）梁君彥 strike down 㗎喇，咁所以佢哋就覺得唔需要做呢啲嘢喇」，惟何認為至少提出問題是讓公眾知道的機會；而如公眾認為問題應該問，而梁君彥強行排除，「咁公眾都會覺得係梁君彥嘅問題。」何強調因此即使無法審核預算案，但只要仍有提出修正案或提出書面質詢的權力，「我哋都應該要盡用佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問「武鬥」是否指肢體抗爭，何指「文攻武鬥」是過去數年大家討論立法會時的術語，重申「如果我哋畀人熄咪而保安已經衝緊埋嚟，唔等於我哋就要放棄我哋當刻要講嘅嘢」，強調若她成為議員，不論是否有用，「我就有一個責任，即使畀人用一啲肢體上嘅方式阻止，我都應該要提出我當刻應該要提出嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在論壇亦提及，政府前一日就「光時」發聲明，像突然頒布新法律去定義，但她認為「呢個明明係我哋呢場運動非常核心嘅精神，佢只能夠係由人民去定義」。何在法官追問下，指《國安法》實施首日拘捕了將「光復香港 時代革命」旗幟插在電單車的人士，大家「唔知拉咩嘅」，而政府兩日後發布聲明宣布「光時」口號已犯《國安法》（翻查資料，政府於7月2日發聲明）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦一度問何為何選擇在論壇批評楊岳橋，以及指中共不允許反對派做不可控的行為是什麼意思，惟陳慶偉指「我不認為我們需要進入這些政治（“I don’t think we need to go into all these politics, do we?”）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DJYTQq4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（25日）踏入審訊第91天。何桂藍繼續作供，就初選論壇提「抗擊中共極權」，何指中共是「極權」為學界共識，指有「全面控制」之意。辯方一度問何的說法是帶貶義抑或事實陳述，法官陳慶偉認為兩者無分別，辯方解釋若形容美國為「極權」或帶貶義，因美國並非極權，又指極權是指獨裁、一黨專政。陳慶偉續問日本和俄羅斯是否「極權」，並一度指日本基本上也是一黨，何高聲說：「唔係啊，日本有共產黨㗎。」中何最後指，形容中共極權是「客觀描述」，與褒貶無關，而她想表達「總之香港人係唔希望活喺一個方方面面都受到政權嚴格控制嘅制度之下」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何亦表示《國安法》將實施時社會很大恐慌，港人認為「做乜嘢都係送頭」，惟何認為「有《國安法》就乜都做唔到」只是中共要求港人接受的說法，並非她所見的現實，認為香港人仍有抗衡方法。何又自言雖料某些審議行為或犯《國安法》，但「我冇估到、或者我從來都冇諗到，撳個反對掣就係犯法」，直言這對在港生活30年的她，簡直是「匪夷所思」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍解釋破局意思打破政權設立規則-按自己規則行事&quot;&gt;何桂藍解釋「破局」意思：打破政權設立規則 按自己規則行事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍今繼續作供。辯方大律師 Trevor Beel 問及何在初選論壇提及「死局」和「破局」的意思，何指說法是來自政治理論，簡單而言是政權會建立一些特定的結構（structure），既指體制（institution）亦關乎敘述（narrative）的東西，造成現實上會有很多限制、同時也會令民眾心理上覺得受到局限，「似乎佢哋必須要面對個現實，就係冇 alternative 嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何指，一旦民眾「見到官方嘅講法唔係唯一嘅講法、官方呈現嘅現實唔係唯一嘅現實嘅話，咁政權對民眾無論實際上或者心理上嘅控制就會失去」，「抗爭」在理論的說法就是建立「anti-structure（反結構）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，當政權訂立規矩限制人民行為，強制要求所有人跟從同一套遊戲規則，而若抗爭者可離開這些規則，按自己規則去行事和行動，「就相當於打破咗政權 set 出嚟嘅 structure」，就是「破局」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何有國安法就乜都做唔到只是中共要求港人接受的講法-但不是現實&quot;&gt;何：有《國安法》就「乜都做唔到」只是中共要求港人接受的講法 但不是現實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，在2020年6月28日論壇發言時，當時眼中「死局」是《國安法》數日後會正式在港實施，當時社會有很大恐慌，「唔知可以點樣做落去，覺得做乜嘢都冇用、做乜嘢都係送頭。」法庭傳譯主任將「送頭」譯為「self-incriminating（自證其罪）」，何指「翻譯譯得非常之好」，並補充「送頭」亦有作「無謂犧牲」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，因此當時發言最關鍵目的就是嘗試說服港人，「有《國安法》就乜都做唔到只係中共要求香港人接受嘅一個講法，但並唔係我所見到嘅現實，我所見到嘅現實就係，即使喺呢個情況之下，香港人仍然有抗衡嘅方法嘅」，而透過立法會選舉取得最大的民意授權（mandate）和票數（turnout）就是其中一個方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，當何說服人時，是說服他們做什麼？何指有三點，包括「唔好因為有《國安法》就覺得香港已經完全冇希望完全冇嘢做」、「唔好覺得有《國安法》就完全冇抗爭嘅餘地」，及在她身位而言「希望大家唔好因為咁而放棄即將來到嘅選舉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何在港生活30年從無想過撳個反對掣就係犯法-直言匪夷所思&quot;&gt;何：在港生活30年從無想過「撳個反對掣就係犯法」 直言「匪夷所思」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，何認為即使《國安法》後，仍然有合法的事可以做？何即表示：「問題就係喺《國安法》之下，其實我哋無辦法判斷乜嘢係違法乜野係唔違法，所以啲人先咁驚。」李續着何回答前小心聽和小心想，並再問，何當時是否認為《國安法》後仍可以合法地表達意見。何說：「當然啦因為，我相信法官嘅意思唔係有《國安法》之後香港做乜嘢都係犯法啊嘛？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指他關注的是何當時的思想狀態（state of mind）。何回應，當時想法與一開始決定參選的想法相似，就是認為抗爭有很多形式，有些的確有風險，「但係選舉係最多人可以參與，正正係因為我當時嘅心態係，投張票無可能係違法嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問是指在選舉投票？何答「無論係選舉入面定係喺立法會入面」，她坦言在兩辦譴責郭榮鏗和《國安法》通過後，雖然未必認同，但她有擔心也已認定一些審議行為可能觸犯《國安法》，明白有此風險。惟何表明：「但係我冇估到、或者我從來都冇諗到，撳個反對掣就係犯法。我覺得作為一個喺香港生活咗三十年嘅人，呢樣嘢簡直係匪夷所思。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇提中共極權-何稱屬客觀描述香港人不想要這種制度&quot;&gt;論壇提「中共極權」 何稱屬客觀描述、香港人不想要這種制度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就何提及「同全香港人一齊抗擊中共極權」，何表示，「簡單嚟講呢，形容中共係『極權』，我形容係而家學界嘅一個共識，爭在你形容佢係一個乜嘢形態嘅極權，即係 digital totalitarianism（數字極權主義），定係 neo totalitarianism（新極權主義）嗰啲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「雖然『極權』佢聽落係一個批評，但係佢同時都係一個定義」，指英文「total」可理解為「total control（全面控制）」，意指「政權喺人民生活嘅方方面面，你做嘢又好、返到屋企又好、你搭咩車、搭咩飛機，所有嘢都係政權可以監控甚至控制嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，因此何提及「極權」時，不是用作貶義（derogatory），而是事實陳述？主控萬德豪指問題非常引導性，Beel 指只是想澄清何的說法。法官陳慶偉表示何剛才只是談及學術上對「極權」的理解，但無談及個人理解，無直接回答 Beel 的問題，又指嚴格來說確是引導性問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;討論何謂極權-辯方稱屬一黨專政-官指日本基本上都只有一個政黨&quot;&gt;討論何謂極權 辯方稱屬一黨專政 官指日本基本上都只有一個政黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續回應，剛才的說法就是她理解「極權」的意思。陳慶偉續問，那何對「中共」的理解是怎樣？是極權還是什麼？何先說：「嗱我坐左監兩年半喇，我唔知而家最新嘅講法係點樣」，陳慶偉問那她論壇上是貶義抑或事實陳述，並主動指坦白說看不到兩者分別。Beel 續舉例，若形容美國是極權或是貶義，因為美國不是極權；但若按事實說出某個政權是極權，就不可能是貶義，因為那只是一個事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指這很困難，問如何定義極權？Beel 認為頗為簡單，就是獨裁、一黨專政（dictatorial one-party system）。陳慶偉問，日本是不是極權？何桂藍即說「咩呀」，Beel 回應不是，因為日本行議會制，可透過選舉投選不同政黨。陳慶偉問，那俄羅斯呢？Beel 指俄羅斯是極權。陳說「為什麼，俄羅斯也有國會」，Beel 即指「但它只有一個政黨」。陳說「日本也是，基本上也是一個政黨（“So as Japan, essentially one party.”）」，何桂藍驚訝說：「咩呀？」，又高聲說：「唔係啊，日本有共產黨㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，這就是當辯方問何是貶義抑或事實陳述時，「我們面對的困難」，又指他不是要辯論。李運騰則指，法庭並不關注學術定義，而是關注被告當時的想法，「不要被學術辯論分心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何最後回應，同意形容中共是「極權」是一個客觀描述，並指「褒義貶義呢啲無關係嘅，問題係香港人唔要呢一種制度」，這亦是她想表達的意思，何並舉例所謂「呢個制度」，就是「你返工要對住黨委、你拍拖要向黨委交代、你去維權佢會屈你有 COVID、你健康碼會變咗紅色⋯⋯總之香港人係唔希望活喺一個方方面面都受到政權嚴格控制嘅制度之下，我相信呢個係非常清楚嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，日本參眾兩院均有不同政黨擁有議席，包括執政聯盟的自民黨和公明黨、立憲民主黨及日本共產黨等，而自民黨自1955年成立後，除1993至1994年及2009至2012年外均維持執政地位。至於俄羅斯國會上下議院，除統執的統一俄羅斯黨外，俄羅斯共產黨及自由民主黨等也有議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何重申立法會失效-連討論政策功能也無法做到&quot;&gt;何重申立法會「失效」 連討論政策功能也無法做到&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦問何於論壇稱「立法會唔再係一個議事嘅殿堂，只係一個抗爭嘅陣地」的意思。何指當時很多人常說這句話，但她認為不是「叫人去行動」的口號，而是說明一個事實，即一直以為可以議事的立法會，「其實從來都唔係一個真正可以議到事嘅地方，所以佢係一個抗爭陣地。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，何是否認為立法會內不能有效（effectively）地議事？何回應，如果一個立法機關無辦法實際上制衡到行政機關，就是一個「失效」的立法機關，指如議員進入議會也只可發表意見、向官員發問，「其實你喺 Facebook 都做到呢樣嘢」，而現時立法會內，「可能連要求官員交一份文件出嚟畀議員睇嘅權力都未必有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指，因此若說純粹無辦法有效議事，她不太認同，強調很多時議員甚至連獲得充分資訊考慮政策再決定投票立場的空間也沒有，「財委會可能真係開會開到一半突然間掟四百頁畀你。」何認為，「如果行政機關對立法會議員係咁嘅態度嘅話，佢根本都唔認為佢需要聽立法會嘅意見，或者畀立法會足夠嘅資訊去考慮嘅話，我會話連最基本討論一個政策呢個功能佢都做唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指公民黨無承諾35-會做什麼-為抗爭意志成疑表現&quot;&gt;何指公民黨無承諾35-會做什麼 為「抗爭意志成疑」表現&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何桂藍在論壇向公民黨楊岳橋提問，是否只有「35+」才會否決預算案和政府法案時，曾表示「如果我哋要說服香港人，議會戰線對運動仍然有好強大嘅作用嘅話，我哋首先候選人就要展現出相應嘅抗爭意志」，Beel 問展現抗爭意思的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qn3yndL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 楊岳橋（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何表示，當時觀察到公民黨在6月底仍在說「如果我哋能夠達成35+，我哋就否決呢樣否決嗰樣」，惟何認為當時在她或很多選民眼中，35+已無法達成，故認為公民黨是迴避問題，「做咗個承諾係佢自己唔需要實現嘅」，「只承諾攞到35+先做乜乜乜，但完全冇 address 過如果35-嘅話公民黨會點樣樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，認為公民黨無向選民交代35-會做什麼，就是「抗爭意志成疑嘅表現」。法官陳仲衡問，所以35-仍會否決預算案，就是展現抗爭意志？何指當時討論不是這樣，因預算案並非論壇甚至初選的關鍵議題，又重申公民黨過往曾就同一件事有不同投票立場、或就某些議題明知現行制度有問題仍投贊成票，故當時認為該黨透過強調35+而「掩蓋咗呢個問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何重申抗爭意志是承認立會非可幫選民落實訴求地方&quot;&gt;何重申抗爭意志是承認立會非可幫選民落實訴求地方&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在追問下，重申展現抗爭意志就是她早前就「抗爭派」的解釋，即不只是重大或公眾關注的議題才表現得強硬，「每一條法案、每一條議案幾細囈都要盡責審議」；承認立法會並非可以議事和幫選民落實訴求的地方，「唔好再話我當選、或者乜嘢數量嘅民主派當選就落實到乜嘢訴求」；而且「行動上唔以保住自己席位或者不被DQ為最優先考慮」。何又指就第一和三點或不太明顯，但就不給予假希望上「我覺得公民黨係有所欠缺嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 總結，即何認為候選人應盡量讓公眾知道其立場？何指「其實我大概明法庭問緊嘅嘢係乜嘢」，李運騰指這不是法庭而是辯方律師的問題。何指法官陳仲衡問及抗爭意志是否指否決財案，但當時論壇上的人，「最後係咪自己有得去投呢個議案我哋都唔肯定，所以我亦都唔認為應該喺嗰個時間點去講一啲其實唔會係自己做嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問若向選民提35不可能的效果-何稱相信亦希望更多人投票&quot;&gt;被問若向選民提「35+」不可能的效果 何稱相信亦希望更多人投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍其後表示，她認為35+的目標是「不可能（impossible）」，而不止是「不切實際（unrealistic）」。李運騰問何有否向公眾表明取得35+是不可能，何指她論壇上有這樣說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，何指望於初選取得最大票數，若她公開表示認為過半是不可能，對選民有何影響？何指若她說服到選民「投立法會仍然係有意義」，「我相信個投票嘅熱情唔會爭太遠」，亦相信當時選民「心中有數」，「唔會純粹覺得冇可能就唔投。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在法官追問下續指，她甚至希望「喺我哋咁樣講清楚之後，個 turnout（票數）會更加多添」，解釋因本身民眾對立法會可做的事不抱任何期望，「如果你仲同佢哋講投我入去，我幫你哋達成啲咩、有咩訴求」，她認為說法不吸引，反而予人很壞的印象，「香港已經咁樣，你仲掛住個議席。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何指，「如果你清清楚楚同選民交代，其實你都知道閘都未必入到，但係我哋投票，正正就唔係為咗喺立法會攞個議席可以做到啲乜嘢，而係喺當時就住中共嘅作為，表達一個香港人最清晰嘅立場，我相信或者我希望當時有更加多嘅人因為咁樣而投票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LeKfBsp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（25日）踏入審訊第91天。何桂藍繼續作供，就提到「攬炒」的帖文解釋。何指當時有關「攬炒」的輿論有「自毀」傾向、強調犧牲和死，惟何認為「抗爭唔係求死，係求生嘅」，指「中共炒到埋嚟嘅時候」，香港人的求生意志可以打開新的空間，犧牲和絕望等說法是抹殺2019年運動的創造性。何又曾以「博弈論」討論「攬炒」，強調抗爭一方有「好強嘅理性基礎」，雖未必可直接對中共造成損傷，但會將其推向鎮壓或回應民意的位置，而「攬炒」是建基於中共會過度反應的假設。何強調「冇人迫佢揀鎮壓呢條路，佢唔需要講到立《國安法》啊盛啊呢啲嘢好無辜咁」，指既然中共選擇破壞香港制度，便要承受該選擇的代價。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指抗爭唔係求死係求生-絕望等說法抹殺2019運動創造性&quot;&gt;何指「抗爭唔係求死，係求生」 「絕望」等說法抹殺2019運動創造性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍今繼續作供。辯方大律師 Trevor Beel 就何桂藍的 Facebook 帖文發問，其中6月29日的〈香港人，千其唔好睇少自己 — 攬炒的哲學〉，配圖為6月9日遊行，並有「奪回香港」橫額。何解釋想表達「如果香港人係願意咁多人行返出嚟嘅時候，個力量係好大嘅」，故盡量找一張多人的相。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問「攬炒的哲學」意思，何重申參選其中一個原因是想有身位演繹「攬炒」，因當時輿論談及「攬炒」時，有些東西她不同意。何舉例，無可否認2019年很多抗爭者有一種「自毀」的傾向，「佢哋會好強調犧牲、強調死，因為佢哋正正就係睇唔到喺咁大嘅壓迫之下，自己可以做乜，或者自己做嘅嘢可以有咩用。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何強調，「抗爭唔係求死，係求生嘅」，形容中共「炒到埋嚟」時，「可以打開新嘅空間，係香港人嘅求生意志」，因此像「犧牲」或區諾軒所說的「絕望」情緒，「我認為係抹殺咗2019嘅創造性」，她望有機會可說清楚香港人所做的事究竟有什麼效果，或者正在打開什麼空間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰一度關注帖文提及「狹路相逢勇者勝」，指昨日選舉單張岑敖暉的介紹也有提到，問何是否引用岑，何回應：「但係呢句野唔係岑敖暉作㗎嘛……梁振英都成日用嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7OsOGHM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，區諾軒曾供稱主張否決預算案向北京施壓的攬炒一派，是「表達緊一種絕望」，因覺得長時間也無法實現心目中理想的香港，故要用盡抗爭手段爭取「破局」來「置諸死地而後生」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何以博弈論討論攬炒-解釋抗爭一方有好強理性基礎&quot;&gt;何以博弈論討論「攬炒」 解釋抗爭一方有「好強理性基礎」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍於帖文提及博弈論中的「Game of Chicken」，即若兩架車迎面駛向對方會車毁人亡，最理性做法應是剎車，但因兩個司機也認為對方會剎車，故兩邊也無停車。何文中形容「攬炒」與此遊戲相似，兩架車分別為香港和中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何今指，很多本地學者以博弈論討論「攬炒」，2019年7月已看到相關說法，但她當時這樣提出，是因「《國安法》下好多人覺得再做都係送頭，都係唔理性嘅，但係我想強調返，抗爭一方做嘅東西其實係有好強嘅理性基礎」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就帖文提到「我哋要做嘅，就係繼續抗爭」，何強調2019運動中，「大家選擇用乜嘢形式去抗爭，應該係基於自己嘅判斷，而唔應該係望住一啲知名人物叫你做咩就做咩嘅」，因此她一直以來亦「唔會去好直接咁話大家應該去做啲咩」，而是認為「大家繼續做可以做同自己認為做得到嘅嘢」，在她而言就是繼續說服更多人投票。法官陳仲衡一度問，文中「黨安法」是否指《國安法》，何同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何攬炒是建基中共一定會過度反應&quot;&gt;何：「攬炒」是建基中共一定會過度反應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於帖文最後提及「但係如果我哋唔退讓，即使佢（中共）架車要撞埋嚟，佢一樣要遍體鱗傷，焦頭爛額。攬炒必然對我方有成本，但我哋要佢哋輸得更加甘」，何解釋是指合法性危機，指如港人已非常明顯表達政治意志，中共仍不回應並採取壓制和操縱選舉的方式，「佢相當於係自己破壞咗香港成個制度嘅正當性」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並強調，香港人可做的事未必對中共直接構成任何損傷，「只係將佢推去一個選擇，一個佢必須要做抉擇，究竟係鎮壓定係回應民意呢一個位」，而「攬炒」的想法是建基於「中共一定會 overreact（過度反應）」的假設，即中共「會做一啲其實佢要解決個問題根本唔需要做到咁盡嘅嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何民主化是中港政府憲制責任中共破壞制度要承受代價&quot;&gt;何：民主化是中港政府憲制責任、中共破壞制度要承受代價&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並表示，香港人由頭到尾都是爭取「民主化」，所要的「其實就係《基本法》講咗嘅嘢咋嘛」，甚至香港人「完全唔爭取、完全唔做任何示威」，理論上香港民主化本身都是中港政府的憲制責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指「遍體鱗傷，焦頭爛額」的前提，「就係佢堅持要撞㗎車埋嚟」，即是說政權不單不履行本身的憲制責任，可以聆聽民意時亦「自己選擇唔去聽」。何續說，「我必須要強調，冇人迫佢揀鎮壓呢條路，佢唔需要講到立《國安法》啊盛啊呢啲嘢好無辜咁，既然佢選擇去破壞香港嘅制度，咁佢當然要承受返佢呢個選擇嘅代價啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何解釋曾被抹黑不會議會抗爭-故發文回應&quot;&gt;何解釋曾被「抹黑」不會議會抗爭 故發文回應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何桂藍7月9日的帖文〈「唔抗爭，選你入去做咩？」〉，何解釋當時網絡誤傳她不會議會抗爭，認為是「抹黑」，故發文澄清。帖文配圖為內會衝突的情形，可見多名保安包圍朱凱廸等議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何不太同意李運騰指配圖是議會抗爭例子，指當時情況是一個立法會議員向主席表達意見，但被主席「熄咪」，而他嘗試走去主席台時，「就幾十個保安衝埋去，去阻止佢發言」，故配圖是顯示民主派議員在議事廳內受到限制，而且是「肢體上的限制」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在帖文提及「『武鬥』是議會抗爭的必備元素，我亦當然會與其他抗爭派議員齊上齊落」，又指「武鬥」要發揮效用有兩個條件，「1、需要盡可能多的抗爭派進入議會。2、需要議會內所有民主派互相協作，不陷入幾個人單打獨鬥的局面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱若建制派對民主派施暴-應阻止而非守住溫和形象不應屈服暴力&quot;&gt;何稱若建制派對民主派施暴 應阻止而非守住溫和形象、不應屈服暴力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋在她眼中「民主派唔一定需要武鬥嘅」，但如在立法會想履行議員職責時，「我哋都未舉手、我哋只係企咗起身，就已經有保安衝埋嚟阻止⋯⋯而另一邊廂，喺主席未作出任何裁決嘅時候，建制派嘅議員已經率先會用武力，夾硬將你拉離會議廳」，何指若到了這個地步，「究竟所謂履行議員責任係順從呢一啲暴力離開議會廳、或者放棄表達自己嘅意見；定係要用盡一切方式都需要履行返自己責任，去講返當刻嗰個會需要你講嘅東西呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「當議會入面其中一派嘅人係不停咁使用呢一啲暴力去阻止你去履行職責嘅時候，我個人嘅睇法，係唔應該屈服於呢一啲暴力，無論係立法會主席嘅武斷、制度上嘅暴力，定係保安同建制議員肢體上嘅暴力」，而應盡自己所能去做要做的事，不論提規程問題抑或是指出立法會主席越權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續解釋，即使她無法入議會、亦想像只有少數民主派能進入議會，但作為一個支持度不低的候選人，也想加入討論「萬一有人入到去，佢應該點」。而何認為無論誰入議會，「大家都應該一齊做（「武鬥」）」，舉例如有建制派將民主派議員「掟落地下拖行」時，「你應該要去阻止佢嘅，而唔係因為覺得要守住自己一個溫和嘅形象……由得好個別嘅議員自己面對呢啲暴力。」被告欄內的林卓廷一度與鄒家成等說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱不會主動傷人-但無理由因暴力放棄履行議員責任&quot;&gt;何稱不會主動傷人 但無理由因暴力放棄履行議員責任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，何桂藍是「以暴易暴」嗎？何指其準則很簡單，指這些事情「唔係無啦啦發生」，一定是她提出意見或指出程序問題被阻止時，她當下要想辦法「做返我本身應該做嘅嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 追問，那是否代表民主派被建制派暴力對待時，要在議事廳打架？何指首先是制止建制派行使暴力，如可以制止就毋須繼續；又指在該情況下，「保安係唔會幫你㗎嘛，保安只會打埋你一份啫」，旁聽席傳來笑聲。何續認真說：「Sorry 唔係一個笑話，佢哋係會帶戰術手套入 chamber 㗎嘛」，並表示：「我唔會主動傷害任何人，但係如果係阻止佢哋對其他人行使暴力、或者佢哋打我嘅時候，我當然要阻止佢哋啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，而另一個做法是離開議事廳，但何不視這為選項。何指「但與此同時個會仲開緊嗰喎」，強調「做返佢哋想阻止我做嘅嘢」、履行當時議員責任也很重要，「無理由因為佢哋行使暴力，我就放棄我作為議員應該做嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何重申議員無法阻政府濫權或落實倡議-選擇可能dq路線不等於浪費選票&quot;&gt;何重申議員無法阻政府濫權或落實倡議 選擇可能DQ路線不等於浪費選票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何帖文提到溫和泛民支持者認為「如果你入到去都係 DQ，咁我點解要投你啊？」，但「說服他們議會已經無法正常議事，是每一個抗爭派參選人的責任」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何今重申，有選民認為議員可阻止政府惡法或濫權行為，或可落實某些倡議；惟何強調這些事情是「做唔到」，是次選舉目的亦非「投一啲議員入去阻止啲乜嘢」，因此一個候選人選擇一個可能被DQ的路線，「唔等於佢係浪費緊選票。」何又舉例，《逃犯條例》「最原初咪就係因為民主派堅持咗幾個月都阻唔到，所以先至會有一切後續嘅事情，民主派最多就係拖幾個月」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何重申議員只能盡量曝光政府議案問題-惟認未能解決甚至被針對&quot;&gt;何重申議員只能盡量曝光政府議案問題 惟認未能解決甚至被針對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，若何認為議會無法正常議事，議員即使拖延也只是暫時、政府最終也能通過想通過的議案，而議會無充分的制衡，無法影響政府政策，那何期望議員進入立法會做什麼？何先指，李列舉的不是假設，「過去幾十年都係咁嘅」，並認為議員入立會後可用非常僅餘的權力，至少盡量指出政府法案的所有問題，如「邊啲位係做數、邊啲位係掩蓋咗一啲隱藏嘅開支」，又如政府派錢、減稅時隱藏了未經持份者同意就強行做的工程，何強調若非議員「你連嗰份野都攞唔到」。何說話時林卓廷和黃碧雲對話，陳志全亦微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「如果你將上述所有嘅問題都曝光之後，佢仍然唔通過嘅話，就全香港都會見到嗰個問題」，惟何亦強調過去二十多年，「你曝光咗啲問題之後，作為立法會議員你未必解決得到」，甚至當中共或香港政府發現這樣會造成認受性問題，然後「佢哋會針對你」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第90天。何桂藍繼續作供，就參選宣言作出解釋，當中提及「或者最理性嘅選擇，係認命、放棄抵抗」，但「反抗，先可以改變到香港嘅宿命」。何解釋，很多港人幻想香港可維持現狀，但她認為在一國兩制下，當一國不斷變化，兩制無可能不變，「香港永遠都冇可能留喺『冇民主但都有自由』呢個幻想入面」，她亦不會因此接受一個「表面繁榮但係實際上不斷破壞緊香港」的現狀，形容這是所有參與2019年運動的人的選擇。何又指，當大陸情況不斷惡化，「香港憑咩覺得自己可以偏安一隅、維持住一個有法治有自由嘅地方呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並解釋，在「乜嘢都守唔住」下，「反抗先可改變香港宿命」就是明知會招致好大打壓，仍實踐相信的事和應得的權利，舉例初選便是民間透過實踐所相信的民主，去抗衡對民主的打壓，形容反抗和自我實現是一體兩面。而何望透過參選，說服民眾即使立法會無法履行憲制責任，議會仍能「助燃場運動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指戴耀廷首要考慮非應對中共打壓-而是盡所能包攬最多民主派參與&quot;&gt;何指戴耀廷首要考慮非應對中共打壓 而是盡所能包攬最多民主派參與&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供。上周談及取得35+的可能性時，何指認為35+無可能，但戴耀廷則稱民主派可達40+甚至46+議席，但不記得來自哪篇文章。辯方大律師 Trevor Beel 今展示戴耀廷5月發布的〈攬炒，to burn or not to burn?〉和〈請您做一個真正的建制派〉，戴提及民主派或出人意外地達到40+。何確認，並指戴另有文章提及「46+」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，無論戴提及多少議席，她認為分別是，當大家不斷想如何透過更「激進化」吸引更多人支持時，戴耀廷「從來都係一個方向」、其興趣從來都是重新檢視制度，「搵吓有咩空間可以畀更加多人參與」，「要包攬最多最多嘅香港人去參與」，笑言「佢係想連建制派都說服埋一齊35+嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，由戴於2017、2018年區議會「填白區」，到2020年辦初選，也是同一思路，並認為戴草擬的「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」一句，首要考慮（priority）並非應對中共打壓，而是「盡佢所能將盡量多嘅民主派系都包喺初選呢件事入面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ei3ppZt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 戴耀廷（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，但何上周說戴草擬該句是為避免DQ，現在又說不是他首要考慮？何指，與其說戴本人「真係好想避免DQ」，更準確說法是「佢 cater（迎合）緊溫和派對DQ嘅憂慮，同時佢亦都 cater 緊其他人對唔應該迴避呢個核心議題（否決預算案）嘅睇法」，故認為戴首要考慮是大家都能參與，同意法官指是迎合（accommodate）越多人越好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷稱足夠選民藍轉黃可能獲46席-官指不切實際&quot;&gt;戴耀廷稱足夠選民「藍轉黃」可能獲46席 官指不切實際&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後在控方提醒下，展示7月2日戴耀廷文章〈搶灘功能界別要「藍轉黃」〉，提及若有足夠數量選民「藍轉黃」，在功能組別「搶灘成功」，便可能獲46席，何稱相信有看過這篇。法官陳慶偉即說「藍轉黃」基乎是不可能，因參與初選首要資格是認同「五大訴求，缺一不可」，陳志全大笑。Beel 說法官是指戴是有些瘋狂，陳慶偉說不是瘋狂，Beel 補充是不切實際，陳慶偉同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱報名時無看過提名表格內容-理解所指共識為辦初選和論壇&quot;&gt;何稱報名時無看過提名表格內容 理解所指「共識」為辦初選和論壇&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就提名表格發問，問何如何理解「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」，「共識」的意思。何先指「我必需要講我簽呢張嘢嘅時候，其實我冇睇到內容」，因她當時理解就是戴耀廷6月9日記者會宣布毋須簽協議，而她是在看到審訊文件夾時「先見到呢份嘢入面有呢幾隻字」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟法官陳仲衡指，何應至少有閱讀第一點，「我謹聲明我同意如上文第一部分第一節及第二節所述，獲提名為上述選舉候選人，*並同意提名名單上的各候選人排名的次序（如提名名單只由一名人士組成，請刪去此句）」，因相關部分被刪去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指，現在回想當時拿到表格時應已刪去該句，惟陳慶偉指組織者理應不會預先刪去，何指她不肯定，但「由頭到尾我都係話一個人選」。她亦不肯定如何獲得表格，但現時回看理解「共識」是指協調會達成的共識，包括會辦公民投票及其日期，及會辦論壇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指大陸情況不斷惡化-港人不能幻想可偏安一隅維持無民主但有自由&quot;&gt;何指大陸情況不斷惡化 港人不能幻想可「偏安一隅」、維持「無民主但有自由」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問及何桂藍6月18日於 Facebook 發布的參選宣言，何解釋當天開始宣布參加初選和收集提名，並要取得100名新東選民的簽署，又憶述她當日於沙田火車站收取提名，「其實100個（提名）大概10分鐘至15分鐘就有㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問及首段內容：「國安法壓境，面對來勢洶洶嘅逼害同打壓，或者最理性嘅選擇，係認命、放棄抵抗；識時務者，會笑我哋螳臂擋車，作無謂嘅抵抗同犧牲。但佢哋永遠都唔會明白，我哋前仆後繼，係因為我哋知道，反抗，先可以改變到香港嘅宿命」，問「反抗，先可以改變到香港嘅宿命」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指區諾軒作供時曾指他們這派人是不希望對香港再存有幻想，法官曾問是什麼幻想，何續舉例，帖文提及最理性選擇或是認命、放棄抵抗，而她眼中，很多香港人的幻想就是香港仍然可以維持現狀、有維持現狀的選擇。但何認為在一國兩制之下，「當一國都不斷咁變化嘅時候，兩制係冇可能維持不變，我嘅理解就係香港永遠都冇可能留喺『冇民主但都有自由』呢個幻想入面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續認為，「唔會因為想留住一啲本來就建立喺浮沙上面嘅 privilege（優勢）同自由」，「而去接受一個表面繁榮但係實際上不斷破壞緊香港嘅 status quo（現狀）」，並形容「呢一個就係所有參與2019年運動嘅人嘅選擇」。翻譯一度未能譯出，法官李運騰提出建議，何一度問「我可唔可以自己用英文講？」，李指何或要換個說法，Beel 亦提醒何要盡量簡單。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續舉例，所謂一國不斷變，就如中英談判或之後很長的時間，「至少國家主席個位都唔係終身制先啦係咪啊」，又指看到2012年後，「中國大陸嘅情況係不斷惡化，咁其實香港憑咩覺得自己可以偏安一隅、維持住一個有法治有自由嘅地方呢？」，因此她說無法假設香港可一直維持現狀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何港人乜嘢都守唔住反抗是明知招致打壓仍實踐想實踐的事&quot;&gt;何：港人「乜嘢都守唔住」、反抗是明知招致打壓仍實踐想實踐的事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 追問，那何說「反抗，先可以改變到香港嘅宿命」是什麼意思？何回應：「香港人成日都會話我哋守住某啲嘢，譬如當法治被破壞，我哋就嘗試守住個法治啦，咁當立法會嘅規章被破壞，我哋就嘗試守住個議會啦，但我認為呢一種心態都證實咗只會令情況越嚟越差，事實上就係乜嘢都守唔住。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續提及，早前法庭曾討論「抗爭」是否譯「resistance」，法官李運騰曾指「resistance」只有「抗」但無「爭」的意思，故她認為「contention」較準確，並指她一直提「抗爭」也是「contention」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GKU3tpU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 何桂藍（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，如她早前所說，反抗的同時「必然係同時建立緊一啲嘢」，而她會形容「反抗同自我實現其實係一體兩面」，因此當她說反抗才可改變香港宿命時，是指「我哋要做我哋相信嘅嘢，我哋要尋求去實踐我哋認為我哋應得嘅權利，即使我哋明知咁樣係會招致好大嘅打壓，唔去褪，而係堅持做我哋本身已經做緊嘅野，先至可以改變香港嘅宿命」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，「contention」本身有「make claim（作出主張）」的意思，「喺打壓嘅人嘅眼中，我哋做嘅所有嘢都係反抗緊佢，但係喺我哋自己嘅角度，我哋從來都係實踐緊一啲我哋想實踐嘅東西。」李運騰問，那何是反抗什麼，和如何反抗？何指宣言提及「國安法」、「迫害」、「打壓」、「極權」，指在此語境下要反抗和抗衡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指初選是民間透過實踐相信的民主-抗衡對民主的打壓&quot;&gt;何指初選是民間透過實踐相信的民主 抗衡對民主的打壓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 追問是以什麼方式反抗，何指是「實踐我哋本身追求緊嘅嘢」，舉例「佢哋唔畀我哋進行真正嘅民主選舉，透過DQ、透過《國安法》去恐嚇同埋嘗試去操縱個選舉，但我會形容初選就係一場由香港民間自己去做、符合民主原則嘅選舉，啫係話我哋透過實踐我哋相信嘅民主究竟係點樣樣，去抗衡佢哋對民主呢件事本身嘅打壓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，即透過舉辦初選爭取最多人投票，展示民眾反應，就是她反抗的方式？何回應這是其中之一，並指初選除了是抗衡不公正的選舉制度，亦是抗衡議會無法制衡行政機關的不公義體制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉打斷，指 Beel 是問何除了辦初選，還有沒有另外的反抗方式。何一度稱與其說透過初選抗衡，應該是說用怎樣的態度辦初選，惟陳再打斷並重複問題。何最後指，當時整個運動「非常之廣闊」，有很多反抗形式，但她當時身位就是推動初選。Beel 提醒她回答問題時盡量集中在她個人而非他人看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指抗衡極權時不獲任何制度保障要承受法外打壓&quot;&gt;何指抗衡極權時不獲任何制度保障、要承受「法外」打壓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，宣言中「面對極權，我哋的確一無所有」是什麼意思。何解釋，當時認為選擇抗衡極權時，「香港畀我哋係冇任何嘅制度保障」，他們會承受一些「法外」的打壓，「但係我哋依然選擇咗咁樣做。」何指如此做時，本身以為有的法律和人權等保護，或當有事發生時「傳媒能唔能夠影得到同埋公諸於世⋯⋯」，惟陳慶偉打斷，問 Beel 原本的問題是什麼，並問是否需要知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指他會問下一條問題，並指因文章在控方案情內，要予何桂藍解釋的機會，陳同意，但指何撰文時讀者也是從字面理解，如她有深層的意思，法官作為普通讀者也不會知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指有市民認為議會拖抗爭後腿-望說服民眾議會有關鍵作用&quot;&gt;何指有市民認為議會「拖抗爭後腿」 望說服民眾議會有關鍵作用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問及何提到「多年以來，呢個不民主嘅議會，都係吸納、消弭街頭運動能量嘅地方」的意思。何解釋，立法會無法履行其憲制責任，不能監察政府亦不能落實任何倡議，「有啲咩惡法或者不公義嘅撥款佢都係守唔住」；惟每當有選舉，「大家嘅關注點都會去晒選舉嗰度，因為大家硬係覺得選多幾個位，件事就總會有啲變化。」何續指，因此每次大型社會運動最後都會轉化成選舉的資本，但議會又無法落實社會運動所爭取的訴求，相當於吸納了社會運動的政治能量後，「但係喺制度入面乜嘢都爭取唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，何帖文提及「喺今時今日嘅香港，議會要去助燃場運動」，但如立法會不能履行其功能，何又說重要的是在選舉引起公眾討論，那選舉後議員應該做什麼？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋，她當時是回應一個較主流想法，就是很多市民很清楚、甚至會說「立法會係廢嘅」，選的唯一作用是「攞十萬蚊人工嚟到幫抗爭者」，否則就是純粹將視線由運動轉移去議會，認為議會「拖抗爭後腿」。而何說「議會要去助燃場運動」，就是希望說服這些人，「議會或者唔會做到好多嘢」、只是「助燃」，但它仍有關鍵作用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何承認國安法下當選民主派議員非常少-無法想像可做什麼&quot;&gt;何承認《國安法》下當選民主派議員非常少 無法想像可做什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於初選後當選的議員如何走，何承認在6月中的時空，「我係想像唔到嘅」，因在《國安法》下，她當時推想即使有選舉，可以入閘、當選、成功宣誓的民主派「一定都非常少，甚至亦都唔係我本人」。惟即使如此，她認為入到議會的民主派仍要「用盡議會呢個空間」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問是什麼空間，何續指「如果喺一個人數非常少嘅狀態之下，盡責審議就更加重要，盡量去 expose（曝露）政府喺推唔同政策時嘅不義行為，令公眾唔會被蒙在鼓裡」，解釋因有些資訊的確只有議員才可獲得和可質詢官員，「但係呢一啲嘢好老實講，對當時嘅我嚟講係太過遙遠。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，故當何說議會要去助燃運動時，其實沒有具體的圖畫，因她想像不到會發生什麼事？何指自《國安法》5月底宣布後，其焦點已轉至選舉如何取得最大票數上，當時甚至連7月1日後會發生什麼事「我都想像唔到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何認為國安法下民主派亦不能退讓&quot;&gt;何認為《國安法》下民主派亦不能退讓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，何指若民主派只有少數會盡責審議，那與以往民主派所做的有何分別？何聽問題時掩口發笑，並指有兩點回應。Beel 提議可先小休，早休後問及何帖文稱《國安法》下「民主派唔可以再係咁退讓，否則就會被逐個擊破，我地只可以用盡一切方法同中共周旋到底」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何一併回應，理解《國安法》是嘗試將本來合法的行為變為非法（outlaw），將盡責審議行為也當成「嚴重干擾」，如立會主席做了不公正裁決，民主派據理力爭也可能犯法，惟何指這情況下，「我認為民主派都唔應該退讓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「逐個擊破」是指DQ問題，何重申認為反對《國安法》已會被DQ，亦觀察到很多參選人為避免DQ，「連一個立法會議員喺《基本法》框架下係有權否決財政預算案呢樣嘢都唔承認」，但何認為：「係咪真係做係一個問題，但你承唔承認立法會議員有呢個權力係另一個問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FxvxqDe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第90天。何桂藍繼續作供，表示明知民主派無法取得35席，仍認為「選舉要打落去」，因要透過投票展示港人有取得35席的實力和意志；而若北京以DQ等應對，便要面對「好大嘅合法性危機」，讓全世界得知北京透過操縱選舉掩蓋港人真正意願。法官陳慶偉一度形容初選是浪費時間和金錢，惟何不同意，指社運很少達到最初訴求，但過程會打開新的空間，又指大部分港人心知中共治下爭民主「從來都係一場妄想」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰打斷，指這並非發表政治演說的場合，惟何指法官可作出定義和發問，但她不准回答是「好唔公平」。法官指其回答不相關，惟何質疑「其實你哋對立法會嘅理解咁少，你點樣分咩係 relevant 咩係唔 relevant？」，又表明「你呢個判斷係好有瑕疵嘅」，法官陳慶偉反駁其錯誤只是由上訴庭糾正。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍與岑敖暉拍片-指35無可能但選舉仍要打落去&quot;&gt;何桂藍與岑敖暉拍片 指35+無可能但選舉仍要「打落去」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供。辯方大律師 Trevor Beel 問及她6月26日，在 Facebook 發布與岑敖暉拍攝的片段，何指應是在發布前一兩天在其選舉辦公室錄製，為其競選宣傳一部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問及，何於片段提及「民主派如果可以喺呢一個立法會選舉達成一個不可能嘅任務，攞到35席，攞到立法會過半嘅主導權，我哋就可以逼出一個北京冇可能接受到嘅局面，從而令到佢用更加瘋狂嘅方式去應對，要付出更加高昂嘅政治代價」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋，當時主流討論是預期北京一定會用方法阻止民主派過半，有人認為「還掂全部都會DQ㗎喇，咁仲投嚟做咩呢」，而她和岑拍片就是想作出回應，清晰告知選民他們意識到取35席是無可能、亦意識到北京一定會用DQ等方式阻止，「但我仍然認為呢個選舉要打落去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱港人行動逼政權不得不回應-但強調從來都冇人逼佢鎮壓&quot;&gt;何稱港人行動逼政權不得不回應 但強調「從來都冇人逼佢鎮壓」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，何是指選前抑或選後DQ，何指早前已曾回應，重申2、3月時認為民主派可能贏到35席，但當選後會被DQ；至4月底兩辦譴責郭榮鏗「癱瘓立法會」、將盡責審議行為說成是「政治攬炒」，何認為大大擴大了可DQ的範圍，要在選舉取得35席已是無可能，「唔會有任何一個民主派做過議員嘅人係安全㗎喇」；至5月底《國安法》宣布，何更認為「大規模DQ」是無可避免，除非香港當時民氣低落到令中共判斷，就算不DQ也未必選到35席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，因此認為選舉仍要「打落去」，就是明知無可能取得35席，仍要找方法展示香港人當時的政治意志，去證實香港人有「實力」去取得35席；而港人行動是逼政權「去做一個選擇」、「不得不回應」，「佢不得不喺鎮壓、或者妥協、回應民意之間選擇。」但何強調：「從來都冇人逼佢鎮壓嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問何有否告知戴耀廷初選浪費時間金錢-何非常之唔同意&quot;&gt;官問何有否告知戴耀廷初選浪費時間金錢 何：非常之唔同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後問，那何桂藍在第二次會議是否無提出對DQ的關注，何指「係唔需要提嘅，因為兩辦咁樣講之後，民主黨、公民黨都自己搵晒 Plan B 㗎喇即刻」。林卓廷和鄭達鴻說「吓」，黃碧雲揮手示意沒有。何續指這是她由政情專欄獲得的資訊，「我知道《明報》嘅政治記者有幾厲害」，但會上無討論「Plan B」身分。林卓廷再說「吓」，陳志全發笑，有被告低聲討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0MdVD8p.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃碧雲（左）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，那何當時有沒有告訴戴耀廷，初選是浪費時間和金錢？何重申，很少社會運動能真正達到原初聲稱的訴求，「但過程中佢會建立咗一啲嘢，打開咗一啲新嘅空間」，又指：「我非常之唔同意嘥時間嘥心機呢一個講法，我相信絕大部分嘅香港人心底裡都知道，喺中共治下爭取民主從來都係一場妄想。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官打斷指非發表政治演說場合-何質疑官對立法會理解少&quot;&gt;官打斷指非發表政治演說場合 何質疑官對立法會理解少&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰一度欲打斷，並着何冷靜，何指「我好 calm 喎咩事」，又疊聲指「我希望完埋頭先嗰句先，我唔希望被斷章取義」。李指不可以，「因這不是一個讓你發表政治演說的場合。（“You can’t, because it is not the occassion to make political speech.”）」何回應：「呢個係一個問題我必須要回答，你問完問題又唔畀人答我覺得好唔公平⋯⋯即係法官就可以定義呢一場嘢，然後將呢個問題 put to 我但我就唔可以回答。」李指視乎何答案的相關性，陳慶偉亦指「如果你的答案與案無關，我們就不會讓你說」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何提高聲量說：「其實你哋對立法會嘅理解咁少，你點樣分咩係 relevant 咩係唔 relevant？」李運騰指認為可由其大狀在陳詞交代，陳慶偉亦對何表示：「我已做了法官25年」，何插口說：「但係你唔知道咩係分組點票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉遂望着何說，「我可能不知道很多事情，但我知道什麼是相關，什麼是不相關」，何即說：「我就係要指出你呢個判斷係好有瑕疵嘅。」陳慶偉指着何回應：「那沒有問題，但我錯誤的決定不是由你來糾正，而是由上訴庭來判斷。（“That’s fine, but my mistaken decision is not going to be corrected by you, but by the Court of Appeal.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後着何聽清楚和集中回答問題，李運騰亦着她回到謄本的段落，何問：「咁我仲需唔需要答嘥唔嘥錢、嘥唔嘥時間呢個問題？」陳慶偉指認為她已回答，就是運動未必會得到期望的結果，但會打開一些空間，並問何所說的結果是否不一定是戴耀廷預期的結果。何說「我覺得你已經 mixed up 咗邊個結果打邊個結果，你可唔可以由頭講一次」。陳慶偉說他不會重複，若何不明白就算了，他會視何不想答他的問題，何語氣加重：「我根本都唔明你問乜！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，何上周五談及議會「冇乜嘢做到」、「議會絕非抗爭終點」時，陳慶偉曾問何桂藍有否將其說法告知戴耀廷和其他初選組織者，並總結何想法即是「35+計劃是浪費時間和金錢」，惟何當時已表明無表達過陳慶偉所指的看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱如港人以投票展示取35席的實力意志-北京以dq應對會面對很大合法性危機&quot;&gt;何稱如港人以投票展示取35席的實力意志 北京以DQ應對會面對很大合法性危機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍其後在主問下，同意她當時望鼓勵人於初選投票。李運騰續問，惟若何認為民主派會被DQ、不能達致35+，又如何能實現何稱北京不可能接受的局面？何回應，問題是若港人因此而決定「算喇咁我唔投票喇」，「咁北京嘅目的就達到喇」，因北京不需處理任何事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何指，如港人仍在初選和正式選舉投票，「畀香港、北京甚至世界清晰見到香港人本身係有攞到35+嘅實力同埋意志」，那無論北京是採取DQ或其他方式應對，「佢都要面對一個好大嘅合法性危機，因為全世界都會見到呢個根本唔係香港人嘅意願，北京係透過操縱選舉嚟掩蓋香港人真正嘅意願。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續補充，因此即使知道無法取得35席，也要在初選取得相應票數。李運騰質疑，初選只涉五個地方選區和兩個功能組別，並不能知道是否真能達到35+。何解釋士氣會有間接影響，指無初選的功能組別本身應屬很難爭取的界別，但若地區直選在初選的氣勢「搞起咗」，認為功能組別選民也會嘗試可否贏到議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後問，何認為取得35+的目標基本上不可能，那她有否告訴戴耀廷？何指與戴在協調會以外無交流，但她選舉文宣一定有這樣公開表達；又指想起第二次協調會議討論運用基本法權力條款時，無提過是否一定要取得35+，其印象是當時「35+攞唔攞到已經唔係大家關注嘅事情」。林卓廷輕聲說「吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fA8G8PQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第90天。何桂藍繼續作供，同意對「立場姐姐」稱呼不太受落，解釋若在運動出名會成為資產、如「名聲嘅暴發戶」，但「立場姐姐」名字「非常之尷尬」，人們是因抗爭者「無臉孔」而改為關注直播抗爭者行動的她。何認為該稱呼「屬於成場運動」，其非常大的政治能量非因她本人而積聚，而是很多無名抗爭者行動帶給港人感受聚合而成的「icon」。何又認為就初選論壇，所謂「鬥黃」是很重要的路線辯論，直言新東論壇候選人除追求民主外，「基本上大家都係冇乜 common ground（共同之處）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何亦指反修例運動於2020年5月進入中美角力，很多港人覺得香港只是一隻棋子，惟何直言2019年運動精神在於不可再有「靠人」的心態，認為港人應該「堅持自己嘅抗爭」，望以「破局」概念令港人突破規矩，致當權者無法再控制香港局面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍單張有與岑敖暉合照-稱排除法選岑其政見可接受&quot;&gt;何桂藍單張有與岑敖暉合照 稱「排除法」選岑、其政見「可接受」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供，辯方展示何3份選舉單張，分別提及「向世界展現 港人面對極權的頑強姿態」、「中共推『國安立法』 香港變『一國一制』」及「國安法打到嚟監控有冇得避？」，每份均有岑敖暉的相片，其中一份亦有何與岑的合照。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰關注為何會與岑一同宣傳，何解釋地區直選候選人常配合超區候選人宣傳，而參選超區包括鄺俊宇、涂謹申、王百羽、李予信，何以「排除法」選擇岑。法庭傳譯主任一度將暱稱「王伯」的王百羽譯為「Uncle Wong」，庭上傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/j742yIg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 王百羽（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問何政見與岑相似？何說「不如唔好用『近似』，用『可接受』呀」，又指首兩份單張「全部都係我寫」，監控一份則由團隊成員準備，由她批准。岑的單張也會有她的相片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指攬炒發生後望以破局延續運動令港人突破規矩致當權者無法控制&quot;&gt;何指「攬炒」發生後望以「破局」延續運動、令港人突破規矩致當權者無法控制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就單張提及「參與議會戰線，不是因爲仍相信制度，而是因為相信香港人，絕不會甘心向極權屈服，相信香港人，有不惜代價但求破局的決心」，何重申不覺得入議會可爭取到實際的東西，但相信即使制度不利港人也不會甘心屈服。何又指5月時中央宣布訂立《國安法》，美國亦作相應反應，很多人認為「攬炒已經發生咗㗎喇」，「攬炒」不再是目標；而運動繼續下去，何望以「破局」的概念來延續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋，「局」是指當權者會設立很多不公平的規矩，「然後威脅你一定要跟住佢呢啲規矩嚟玩，佢會令你覺得必須要接受呢一個係現實，冇 alternative 嘅」，惟何表示「只要香港人夠齊心嘅話，我哋係可以突破到呢啲規矩，令到當權者冇辦法再透過呢啲規矩黎控制香港嘅局面」，當權者要思考回應民意或以其他方法掌握局面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何不同意港人自視為大國角力棋子2019精神在於不可再有靠人心態&quot;&gt;何不同意港人自視為大國角力「棋子」：2019精神在於不可再有靠人心態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就單張提及「當香港正式進入『攬炒』年代，我們更加要讓世界看見，中美角力之間，香港人堅持抗爭的身影」，何重申5月底中國和美國均有「做嘢」，很多香港人認為「已經去到一個大國角力嘅 level 喇，咁香港仲有咩可以做呢」，甚至關注美國政治多於香港政治，「唔再問香港人本身可以點，淨係喺度諗美國可以點樣點樣去對付中共。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何不同意這種想法，直言只是將港人以往對政治明星的崇拜或依賴轉移至外國政府，但她認為2019年的精神，在於「我哋每個人都唔可以再有一個靠人嘅心態，要去諗自己可以做啲咩」。何指當時很多港人會覺得「香港好似只係一個棋子」，甚至覺得應主動迎合大國角力間「棋子」的角色，惟何認為，「香港人應該堅持返自己嘅抗爭，做返自己嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱香港運動從來非為破壞而是爭取更好香港-過程難免承受打壓&quot;&gt;何稱香港運動從來非為破壞而是爭取更好香港 過程難免承受打壓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問及，「攬炒年代」是指一個持續一段時間的過程？何解釋無論《國安法》還是美國對港政策，影響都非常深遠。至於「堅持」，何解釋是「做返香港人由19年開始一直做緊，甚至由八十年代開始一直做緊嘅嘢」，明知有打壓仍「實踐我哋應該有嘅權力」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;單張另提及因「攬炒」而來的「陣痛」，何指認為香港的運動，「從來都唔係為咗要破壞香港，從來都係為咗爭取一個更加好嘅香港，但過程中我哋好難免要承受一啲打壓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍單張從沒提及否決財案和五大訴求&quot;&gt;何桂藍：單張從沒提及否決財案和五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，《國安法》通過的消息傳出後，何曾否修改或停印單張。何指原本單張有一些關於監控和資訊安全的本地法律討論，但因《國安法》來到後「已經無意思」，故作出修改；原本單張亦較多提及初選意義和9月正式選舉的部署，但之後大部份也改成講述《國安法》的影響。何指呈堂單張均是5月底後準備，為已修改的版本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，無論《國安法》實施前或後，所有她草擬的單張都沒有提及否決財政預算案和「五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何鬥黃是重要路線辯論新東論壇候選人基本上冇乜-common-ground&quot;&gt;何：「鬥黃」是重要路線辯論、新東論壇候選人「基本上冇乜 common ground」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 之後就初選論壇目的提問，何解釋初選論壇與過往其他選舉論壇很不同，是只有民主派參與的論壇，並提及6月底時有很多聲音希望民主派能夠「團結一致」取得「35+」，亦覺得有關「墨落無悔」聲明的爭拗「好煩」，惟何不同意，認為「所謂嘅『鬥黃』係好重要嘅一啲路線辯論嚟嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指過去在正式選舉論壇中，民主派候選人即使有分歧，也會集中火力質問建制派，反而沒有處理過自己陣營之間的分歧；但何指事實上出席新東初選論壇的候選人，「除咗大家都係追求民主之外，基本上大家都係冇乜 common ground（共同之處）嘅」，又提及她在論壇才第一次聽到林卓廷對否決財政預算案的立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「我自己都好唔同意話一個 agreement 或者點樣，就統合晒所有人嘅觀點一定要一齊跟咁喇」，而她首次協調會提及如要有共同綱領，便望透過公投交由選民決定；雖然最終無法讓選民決定，但論壇的辯論機會，讓選民可透過初選去選擇想要的路線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱輿論將否決財案塑造成派系紛爭而非事件本質致未有形成很多討論&quot;&gt;何稱輿論將否決財案塑造成派系紛爭而非事件本質、致未有形成很多討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何其後重申，當時有人提出所有參加初選的人都要認同一個共同綱領，她認為如涉綑綁民主派入議會後行動的討論選民都應參與；又指「掟汽油彈嘅係黃，投民協投咗四十年嘅一位深水埗婆婆都係黃」，不認為「幾十個候選人坐埋一齊決定咗一個方向之後，就要數以百萬計嘅民主派選民都要一齊去跟從」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉追問選民如何能決定共同綱領，何舉例2014年佔領中環曾將數個普選方案交市民公投，終有80多萬選民投票。陳續問，但若何指候選人無共同之處，那選民又如何能同意任何事情？&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 2013年6月9日「和平佔中」第一個商討日（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指選舉並非「投票嗰一下」，假如選民毋須就共同綱領投票，對相關討論就不會如此上心；但若他們有份投票決定，才會「睇晒」選前討論，並形成自己判斷，又指2019年以來很多議題也是這樣處理，如「連登討論區」的正評和負評可影響現場決定。何指無制度可充分反映所有參與者意願，但認為應盡量做到這點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，否決預算案未有在2020年「形成好多嘅討論」，因為輿論當時將議題塑造成抗爭派與其他黨派間的「二元紛爭」，只聚焦在派系爭論，而不是事件本質。她認為，若選民當時可討論民主派取得35+後入立法會可做什麼，那2020年的討論便會很不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後問，候選人來自不同黨派，「共同綱領」是難以實現？如可以的話何希望會有什麼內容？何思考一會說：「好難而家咁樣兜返轉頭去睇喇」，法官陳慶偉發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何立場姐姐稱呼尷尬-因抗爭者無臉孔才獲關注&quot;&gt;何：「立場姐姐」稱呼尷尬 因抗爭者「無臉孔」才獲關注&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後引述何桂藍於論壇被介紹為「前記者，人稱『立場姐姐』」，何上身微嘆氣說「係」。Beel 指她似乎對這稱呼不太受落，何再托頭無奈說「係」。Beel 再問何於論壇稱「『立場姐姐』呢個名，唔淨係屬於我，亦都屬於成場運動」是什麼意思，何一度就「立場」笑指「呢個要問（時任《立場》總編輯）鍾沛權喎，唔係我決定㗎嘛」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續解釋，一般而言如在運動「出咗名」、有好高的知名度，「咁嗰樣嘢會成為咗你一樣好好嘅 asset（資產）啦」，尤其在選舉內「如果你真係想攞嗰個位嘅話」，「我會形容係名聲嘅暴發戶」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何續指，「『立場姐姐』呢個名係非常之尷尬嘅」，因為當時人們關注她是因她直播抗爭者行動，人們關注的是運動和抗爭者；但何指人們因抗爭者是「無臉孔」（faceless）而無法知道其身份，故關注「就去晒揸機嗰個人度喇」。何續指雖然積聚在「立場姐姐」的政治能量非常大，但其實這股能量並不是因為她本人而積聚起來，而是「好多無名抗爭者嘅行動，佢哋帶畀香港人嘅感受聚合而成嘅一個 icon」，因此認為該稱呼是屬於整場運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱若取過半票數可奪局面主導權&quot;&gt;何稱若取過半票數可奪局面主導權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何提及入議會「唔係講緊再投議員入去議事咁簡單，而係要奪取主導權，將立法會變成人民嘅武器」，何重申議會是反映人民意願的場所，而《國安法》即將實施時，大家有很強烈「無嘢做到」或「唔知做咩好」的心態，而她認為若匯聚到百萬港人，「投一個足以喺立法會過半嘅票數出嚟」，便能奪取當時局面的主導權，政權便需作出回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第89天。何桂藍繼續作供，表示新東協調會議爭議重點並非應否否決預算案，而是為避免DQ要「褪到咩地步」，而當時與會者談及否決對民生的影響，她認為是擔心選民反應而非出於民生考慮，指民主派多年來均理解「民生從來都係政府不當地動用公帑嘅一個掩眼法」。何又指，當時提出若表明「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力」仍被DQ，溫和選民便會明白DQ是任意的政治決定，而非「乖唔乖」的問題，但會上就「會」或「會積極」無結論，她預期之後會有協議但最終也沒有。何並指，認為用「不民主」形容戴耀廷是「好唔公道」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方指何提及香港「法治無存」，何引終審法院非常任法官包致金就法治的基準，包括權力分立、人權保障等，指明顯香港「一啲都唔合格」，故「法治無存」是準確描述。何又指，對香港政府有非常多不滿但無怨恨，「因為香港政府唔值得任何人嘥精神去怨恨佢，連花時間去怨恨佢嘅價值都冇」；而對控方指她促使（foster）他人對政府怨恨，何指全港有很多人怨恨政府，「唔需要任何人去 foster」，並強調不可假設有怨恨情緒便是不理性或受人煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何不認同黎敬輝指她說綱領更進取較好-指只係撳個反對掣啫&quot;&gt;何不認同黎敬輝指她說「綱領更進取較好」 指「只係撳個反對掣啫」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供，她昨談及新東第二次協調會議的情況，以及她對戴耀廷所擬運用《基本法》權力條款的理解，認為戴「寫咗一句根本乜都冇講過嘅嘢出嚟」。大律師 Trevor Beel 今展示民主動力總幹事黎敬輝就第二次會議的紀錄，提及何曾稱「如以基本法條文作出DQ，必引起大迴響，故綱領更進取較好」，問她有否說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QYrF5eO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指紀錄不太準確，並重申在民主制度下，而預算案「又冇乜問題」，「投反對票係講唔過去嘅，因為你好難向選民交代。」但何指，否決預算案本身的確是立法機關制衡行政機關的憲制武器之一，她理解當行政機關有非常嚴重的越權行為、發生一些事連選民都有非常強烈感受時，「立法機關係有權咁樣做嘅」，這亦是她對《基本法》第50至52條（否決財案後程序）的理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，昨討論戴耀廷草擬的「會積極運用《基本法》賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」一句，「我認為已經冇承諾到話一定會否決財政預算案㗎喇」，因「句嘢基本上跟住《基本法》抄出嚟咁滯㗎喇，如果咁都DQ，咁坊間嘅反應一定會好大」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何指「我唔認為呢一個取態係進取嘅」、亦「真係唔覺得我哋討論嘅嘢關進取唔進取事」，故不認同有說過「故綱領更進取較好」一句：「因為講到尾其實都只係撳個反對掣啫，當時在席嘅黨派基本上都做過呢件事喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱若條款提用基本法權力仍dq-溫和選民便會明白dq是任意政治決定不關乎乖唔乖&quot;&gt;何稱若條款提用基本法權力仍DQ 溫和選民便會明白DQ是任意政治決定不關乎「乖唔乖」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍昨稱，鄒家成會上提出「唔可以用積極，要用會（運用）」，她最後有支持。何重申，個人覺得「會」或「積極」分別不大，而她之所以就此爭議表態，「係因為我感覺到當時喺會入面，支持『積極』嘅一方係有一種想褪嘅感覺」，故她當時表示「呢句嘢已經冇問題到直程係《基本法》抄出嚟咁滯喇」，不認同還要用「積極」這些「跳嚟跳去」的字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在法官追問下再指，就「必引起大迴響」，她有表達類似意思，解釋她理解有些與會者想字眼「冇咁肯定」，是因溫和選民一直有種想法，認為DQ「係有據可依嘅，唔係 arbitrary（任意）嘅」，亦經常說「嗰啲人唔自己玩嘢就唔會被DQ」，並「不斷同候選人講你要醒少少，入到去先慢慢玩，唔好畀人DQ」，簡單而言「佢哋係認為無論政府條紅線畫得有幾過份，都應該迎合咗先」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指，認為當時有些溫和派係是想附和這些選民的想法，但她「非常之唔同意」，而她如此提出，就是因認為「單純地重複《基本法》入面立法會議員嘅權力，我相信連啲溫和選民都冇可能覺得咁樣係玩緊嘢」，而「如果咁都DQ，咁佢哋就終於會明白，DQ 從來都係一個 arbitrary 嘅政治決定，唔係邊個乖邊個唔乖嘅問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱否決財案非爭議重點-而是為避dq可褪到什麼地步&quot;&gt;何稱否決財案非爭議重點 而是為避DQ可褪到什麼地步&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，法官昨引述區諾軒指爭議是應否否決預算案，但「我唔認同呢個係當時爭議嘅重點，我認為當時個會入面個氣氛，其實就係拗緊究竟為咗避DQ你要褪到咩地步」，但何重申，認為「運用《基本法》賦予立法會的權力」根本是句「tautology（同義反覆、贅述）」：「你做立法會議員，梗係會運用權力㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱會上無就會或積極投票-亦無結論&quot;&gt;何稱會上無就「會」或「積極」投票 亦無結論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黎敬輝紀錄指戴耀廷提及「其他區都支持否決 budget」，何指無印象，至於黎指戴提到「形勢變化快 唔好寫死」，何指戴應有表達。至於黎的紀錄提到「『會運用』 - 投票通過」，何指「我只能夠話我冇記憶我有投過呢個票」，亦記得會議最終就「會」或「會積極」運用基本法權力並無結論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指與會者提民生影響僅擔心選民反應民生為政府不當用公帑掩眼法&quot;&gt;何指與會者提民生影響僅擔心選民反應、民生為政府不當用公帑掩眼法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問及，會議上有沒有人提到，如預算案有學校、醫院等項目就不能否決，李運騰亦指這是區諾軒證供（翻查資料，應為趙家賢說法）。何表示，「當時區諾軒咁講我已經覺得好奇怪啦」，並指當時應有討論，個別政黨以往「不嬲都有投反對票」，而他們反對的預算案也會有「民生嘢」，「咁但係點解（議席）冇半數嘅時候你就反對，反而有半數真係反對到嘅時候你又想唔投呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，理解當時有人提出「民生嘢」，是擔心選民反應、「講緊點樣同選民去解釋」，而不是談及發言者本身「會因為民生嘢、醫院學校而覺得唔應該否決（預算案）」。何並指，因當時政府和建制的攻擊是「總之你阻住政府攞錢你就係破壞民生」，但她認為不合理，舉例政府一方面會公屋減租，但另一方面「又 chur 你幾百億咁」，形容多年來所有光譜的民主派均共同理解：「民生從來都係政府不當地動用公帑嘅一個掩眼法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指明白何有她的看法，但法庭關注的是誰說了什麼。何續說，當時認為應不會有民主派「就咁話因為有一啲民生嘢」，而認為預算案不應反對，但「點樣應對建制派嘅歪曲同埋解釋畀市民聽」，就一直是問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又指，部分溫和民主派政黨有「前科」，就是於2004年民主派接近過半時，曾討論要否發出聯合政綱提到「絕不否決財政預算案同癱瘓政府」。何指否決預算案更多是向選民解釋和交代的問題，因當時民主動力召集人鄭宇碩曾提及，此做法是因為當時工商界和建制派攻擊，稱「民主派一旦過半，香港就冧㗎喇」。何欲再解釋時被陳慶偉打斷，指不認為需要再聽下去，Beel 亦說何的答案已足夠，何一度說：「畀我完埋呢句」，陳慶偉說「no」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何不肯定鄒家成有否說過推我哋入去立法會癱瘓政府&quot;&gt;何不肯定鄒家成有否說過「推我哋入去立法會癱瘓政府」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到會上有否提到不予區別否決預算案，何指「如果係『不予區別』呢4隻中文字係冇囉」。法官陳慶偉續問及，黎敬輝紀錄指鄒家成提及「如我們不決意，如何說服香港人於初選投票，推我哋入去立法會癱瘓政府」，何指理解鄒當時望字眼「講實啲」就是想展示一種意志，「否則香港人唔會喺初選投票」，故應有說過前兩句，但不肯定有否說過「推我哋入去立法會癱瘓政府」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱會後預期有協議惟終沒有-後因國安法宣布亦轉移焦點&quot;&gt;何稱會後預期有協議惟終沒有 後因《國安法》宣布亦轉移焦點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎敬輝的紀錄亦提到，戴耀廷指「功能組別的參選人也可邀請簽協議書，如有政黨背景，更加方便都可簽」。何指不肯定戴有否這樣說，但會上有討論初選提名表格會附上一份綱領或協議書的文件，「嗰啲咩『積極』或者『會』（運用基本法權力）全部都喺個附件入面」，是「一啲立場宣示」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，會議結束時理解「係會有份咁嘅嘢嘅」，即預期會有一份向公眾公開的協議，但因當時離初選還有一兩個月，第二次會議結束時「嗰份嘢未成形」，她以為接下來的一兩個月「我哋會搞掂佢」。Beel 問會上達成什麼協議，何舉例首次會議仍在討論是否及何時辦初選，但第二次會議就確認7月辦初選，不過就目標議席是6抑或6+1席就未有結論，她當時期望會在協議處理或解決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，會後沒有收過任何紀錄或文件，最終亦沒有任何協議，並指「好老實講，喺5月底《國安法》宣布咗之後，我會形容大家嘅關注焦點都已經唔再喺呢度喇」，包括她自己，故她「當時都冇去好 chur 住咁去跟進份嘢到底打成點」。陳仲衡問為何《國安法》後會有改變，何指因《國安法》對每人都是「好大嘅威脅」，當時會有很多考慮如是否繼續選、如繼續會否有何修正、「啲單張使唔使印到一半都 call 返返嚟呀，又要重新 draft 過」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指用不民主形容戴耀廷是好唔公道&quot;&gt;何指用不民主形容戴耀廷是「好唔公道」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，基本上所有關於初選的新聞她都有關注，就其他區協調的情況可能與其他候選人私下交談會知道，但沒有正式的文件。Beel 續問，那何桂藍認為戴耀廷主持會議的方式是「不民主」嗎？何搖頭：「我認為用不民主嚟形容戴耀廷係一個好唔公道嘅講法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何引包致金標準指法治無存是客觀陳述&quot;&gt;何引包致金標準指「法治無存」是客觀陳述&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，控方開案陳詞指何桂藍提及「香港制度崩壞、法治無存」，對政權有怨恨，問何2020年時對香港政府有否怨恨？法庭傳譯將「resentment」譯作「不滿」，何主動稱應譯作「怨恨」，並指她當時對香港政府「有非常多嘅不滿，不過冇怨恨，因為香港政府唔值得任何人嘥精神去怨恨佢，連花時間去怨恨佢嘅價值都冇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又指，認為該句引述是「客觀嘅陳述」，指「制度崩壞我哋都講過好多喇」，而一個地方有否法治其實有客觀基準，並引終審法院非常任法官包致金於2018年，討論一個不民主的地方法治是否可能時，提到4點，包括要有司法獨立和一份不是朝令夕改的憲法；權力之間要分立；人權要有合法國際基準的保障；不可聲稱有法治就暫停民主化步伐。惟何指：「好明顯呢四點香港一啲都唔合格，所以我認為『法治無存』係一個準確嘅描述。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指港府不值得任何人花精神怨恨不能假設港人怨恨是受人煽動&quot;&gt;何指港府不值得任何人花精神怨恨、不能假設港人怨恨是受人煽動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並主動指，控方該句是指控她促使其他人對香港政府的怨恨（foster resentment），但何指「我對自己公開發言嘅要求係好嚴謹嘅，我只會講有理有據、說服到我自己嘅嘢，嗰啲係一啲事實，同埋一啲有理據嘅批評」，何又補充，「我同意全香港有好多人都好怨恨個政府，係唔需要任何人去 foster 㗎喇，亦都唔可以假設係因為有一個怨恨嘅情緒，佢背後就冇一個理性嘅基礎、或者一定需要人煽動，而唔係佢哋自己嘅判斷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早休時，何桂藍親友向她說：「我愛你呀！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第89天。何桂藍繼續作供，表示看到《國安法》後有兩個反應，首先是「要走就而家好走喇，如果唔係可能一世都走唔到」，其次是「佢哋終於搵到個可以DQ晒全世界嘅理據」。何指當時決定不離開香港，並公開表態反對《國安法》，解釋內地政治犯會以言入罪，而她已發表過很多「會瀨嘢」的言論，因此「避都冇用」。何指料反對《國安法》必定會被DQ，但作為追求民主的人，不反對是「自相矛盾」。惟何亦指，就《國安法》條文列明「干擾」政權機關履行職能，她從無想過「撳個反對掣都算係干預」，因對她而言投票「連議會抗爭都唔算」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，雖料無法入閘仍參與初選，是因選舉是社會運動的一部分，望透過候選人身位參與公共討論，影響更多人想法。何又指當時很多港人無法以遊行表達立場，故望初選「攞一個最大嘅票數」，讓港人透過選舉明確展示他們的政治意志，「就係唔接受《國安法》」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問及何桂藍對國安法理解-何稱5月底已提針對癱瘓立法會行為&quot;&gt;辯方問及何桂藍對《國安法》理解 何稱5月底已提針對癱瘓立法會行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供。大律師 Trevor Beel 問何桂藍何時首次得知《國安法》，何指應是5月21或22日，全國人大常委會副委員長王晨在北京宣布，全國人大通過授權人大常委為香港訂立《國安法》，且當時已提及特別針對癱瘓立法會的行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至5月28日正式通過訂立《國安法》，何指當時已知道有四大罪名，即顛覆、恐怖活動、分裂國家和勾結外國勢力。何續指當時無詳細提及癱瘓立法會，但因4月中聯辦和港澳辦譴責郭榮鏗或民主派時均用相同字眼，故當時理解議員開會時做一些抗議行為「都有機會觸犯《國安法》喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，至6月30日晚《國安法》全文頒布並實施，當中四大罪名下的條款詳細了很多，亦無再用「癱瘓立法會」字眼，而改為用「seriously interfere（嚴重干擾）、undermine（破壞）和 disrupt（阻撓）」等字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱國安法實際條文涵蓋更闊-惟從無想過投反對都算干預&quot;&gt;何稱《國安法》實際條文涵蓋更闊 惟從無想過投反對都算「干預」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，何桂藍閱讀條文後，有確認她早前認為《國安法》立法是用以針對癱瘓政府的行為嗎？何更正是指「癱瘓立法會」，並指兩辦於4月已用「癱瘓」形容一些她認為符合議事規則的事，當時她只是有「憂慮」；但到了6月《國安法》條文使用「干預」或「阻撓」等字眼、亦沒有提「武力」，她理解「癱瘓」字面上明顯比「干擾（interfere）」更嚴重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，理解大陸法律字眼可「亂咁詮釋」，並認為這意味一般她認為是履行議員責任、盡責審議的行為也會被視為「干預」、納入《國安法》罪行內，舉例若立會主席做了有問題的決定，要求終止辯論，而議員不同意其決定並要求繼續辯論，一般人也會理解為「干預」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何強調，在整個控罪期間，「我都真係冇諗過撳個反對掣都算係干預，因為對我嚟講，投票或者投反對票，真係連議會抗爭都唔算。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱看到國安法後決定不離開香港&quot;&gt;何稱看到《國安法》後決定不離開香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，《國安法》後何桂藍有否改變自己參選做法。何指「我哋講返5月尾先啦」，並指當時看到《國安法》消息時有兩個反應，「第一就係要走就而家好走喇，如果唔係可能一世都走唔到喇；第二就係，佢哋終於搵到個可以DQ晒全世界嘅理據。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋，因當時已宣布會透過直接納入《基本法》附件三的方式實行《國安法》，「咁好容易就話你一表態反對《國安法》，就係唔擁護《基本法》喇。」何續說，「咁我第一個決定就係唔走啦」，Beel 問何說「走」是什麼意思，何說是「離開香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指不知國安法有否追溯力-但已講咗好多會瀨嘢嘅嘢避都無用&quot;&gt;何指不知《國安法》有否追溯力 但已「講咗好多會瀨嘢嘅嘢」避都無用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，第二個決定是關於會否公開表態反對《國安法》。何指，因為以前記者的工作，「我對中國大陸嘅政治犯嘅情況都有啲理解」，並指雖然內地《國安法》2016年才訂立，但四大罪名在《刑法》存在已久，如劉曉波、許志永等案例，簡單而言是「以言入罪」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「喺中國大陸，你印一張『平反六四』嘅紙出嚟貼喺個巴士站上面，你都瀨嘢㗎喇」，故：「當時我真係完全冇辦法設想，究竟一條咁嘅法例，擺喺普通法嘅法制入面會發生咩事，我只能根據我對大陸嗰個實行嘅情況嘅了解去做判斷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「我 at that point in time（當時），我已經講咗好多會瀨嘢嘅嘢喇，咁所以，避都冇用喇。」陳仲衡指，但何不應回望過去，而是想將要發生的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何回應「呢個係一個普通法 logic（邏輯）嘅諗法，但係因為佢係納入附件三，所以當時冇人知佢會唔會 retrospective（追溯）咁去計一啲嘢」。何續說：「作為一個怕死嘅香港人，咁我唔會再講一啲我以前未講嘅、更加激進嘅嘢喇，但係以前已經講開嘅嘢，既然已經講咗，亦都冇辦法確保佢唔係 retrospective 嘅話呢，咁就繼續講喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱作為追求民主的人不反對國安法是自相矛盾&quot;&gt;何稱作為追求民主的人不反對《國安法》是自相矛盾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問她認為這會如何影響她參選的機會？何自言作為候選人本身有一個好強的優勢，就是她做記者時不可發表任何個人強烈的政見，故基本上《國安法》議題出現前，「我係白紙一張，好難去DQ嘅」，「但係如果我公開講我反對《國安法》，我當時嘅判斷係一定就DQ喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何停下思考一會再說，但她認為即使她不完全了解《國安法》條文，但看到四大罪名和公布時中國官員的用字，「我會認為作為一個追求民主嘅人，唔反對一條咁樣嘅法例係自相矛盾。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何表示，於5月21或22日得知通過訂立《國安法》後，當晚就在 Facebook 發文表態反對《國安法》以當時形式在香港實現，何直言「我講嗰個 moment，我就知一定DQ㗎喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱反對國安法一刻已料無法入閘做得一日得一日&quot;&gt;何稱反對《國安法》一刻已料無法入閘、「做得一日得一日」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後問，何既然明知DQ，為何仍參與初選。何重申，認為立法會選舉本身是運動的一部分，而取得過半並非立會戰線努力的唯一目的；尤其是5月底《國安法》公布後，已預視下一屆立法會將出現很大變化，能入閘的人會很少，甚至當時很多人已在猜《國安法》實施後，9月便不會有立法會選舉，「所以對我嚟講，基本上就係一個『做得一日得一日』嘅心態。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，即是做什麼？參與初選？何回應，參與初選「就係講緊其實你用一個候選人嘅身位，去參與個公共討論，去影響更加多人嘅想法」。陳慶偉問，故何的目的只是要影響他人？何說在當時時間點，「我嘅目的，係我希望可以喺無論最終選舉又好、如果冇最終選舉就係初選，攞一個最大嘅 turn out，攞一個最大嘅票數。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指明知dq仍參與初選是爭取最大票數-讓港人展示政治意志&quot;&gt;何指明知DQ仍參與初選是爭取最大票數 讓港人展示政治意志&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋，因2020年5、6月時，警方已不可能再發「不反對通知書」，「係冇可能進行到公開嘅遊行咁滯，基本上你行出地鐵站，就會畀警察 cap 埋一齊、拉咗你先喇。」何指，因此「即使有好多嘅香港人想表達佢哋嘅一啲立場，佢哋係無辦法用行動去表達出嚟，個社會係唔會見得到究竟有幾多人係反對一啲嘢」。何續指，「當時選舉就係一個 alternative（替代），畀香港人明確展示佢哋當時嘅政治意志，就係唔接受《國安法》。」何說時法官呈思考狀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問何是談及初選抑或立法會選舉，何指如9月還有選舉就是指正式選舉，但當時廣泛憂慮是屆時不會有正式選舉，「咁如果無正式選舉，初選就好緊要。」何又補充，當她說要取得最大票數時，不是指自己的票數，而是指「成個初選越多人投票越好」，同意這可以展示他們對政府的不滿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wTeXTTq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第89天。何桂藍繼續作供，表示非常不認同戴耀廷毋須簽協議的決定，認為協議條款只是承認立會有否決權，無理由這樣也不敢確認；並指簽署「墨落無悔」就是明確表態，「至少我敢去公開要講呢句說話」，若終被DQ也是政府「使橫手」，不容承認立會有權以否決財案爭取訴求。對有人稱被「夾」而簽聲明，何指如有候選人感受到壓力，是來自選民；並指她就「墨落」看重的，是候選人是否因「不合理的DQ紅線」而「無底線褪後」立場、認為要清楚向選民交代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又表明，認為否決預算案無法直接迫使特首回應五大訴求，最多只是施壓；而她認同聲明「議會絕非抗爭終點」一句，因不想給予民眾「假希望」立會可迫政府行事，認為其他形式抗爭也要繼續。何指這是香港民主運動慣性，雖明知議會「冇乜嘢做到」，但亦講到「好重要」，造成選民「一勞永逸、投咗票就OK」的感覺，故要誠實指出議會是無法爭取五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱事前不知有墨落無聚焦共同綱領但認會上就辦初選等有共識&quot;&gt;何稱事前不知有「墨落」、無聚焦「共同綱領」但認會上就辦初選等有共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍今繼續作供，辯方續就「墨落無悔」聲明書發問。何表示，她「碌Facebook」時看到其他候選人發布該聲明，指她從新聞得知戴耀廷於6月9日記者會表明不要求參選人簽任何協議，她留意到有不滿和不同意的聲音，但事前不知道會用聲明的形式去表達不滿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，當時看到聲明後問其中一名參選人，獲告知想表態可加名。何指理解聲明是各區參選人「想簽就可以簽」，而「我睇完係有意向簽嘅」，遂複製帖文並加上自己名字發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對聲明提及「我們認為，在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎」，何指不清楚其他區的協議，但理解新東開兩次會後，雖就共同綱領具體內容和目標議席等打算「之後再講」，但就舉行公民投票和辦論壇有取得共識。何承認當時焦點無放在「共同綱領」，而是關注聲明內的兩點聲明，但理解協調會議「的確有一啲嘢取得咗大家共識」，亦是大家合作基礎，「唔係傾咁耐傾嚟做咩呢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指否決財案無法直接迫特首回應五大訴求最多只是施壓&quot;&gt;何指否決財案無法直接迫特首回應五大訴求、最多只是施壓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就聲明提及「我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，Beel 問除了否決預算案，何桂藍認為立法會還有什麼權力可迫使特首回應五大訴求？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何表示：「首先我唔認為否決財政預算案可以迫使特首直接回應五大訴求」，指因眾所周知，否決預算案後特首「可能」會解散立法會，然後又要再投票，再看是否否決多一次預算案，惟何指上述「每一步都係唔確定」，如第一步特首便可能不會解散立會，「所以我當時係好唔認同大家跳咗好多 steps 咁樣，將否決財政預算案同落實五大訴求痴埋一齊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，因此否決預算案「無辦法直接迫到特首去回應五大訴求」，「佢最多只係施壓，但之後政府會用咩去回應，係講唔埋嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指無需35盡責審議亦可施壓要齊人返工就是建制派地獄&quot;&gt;何指無需35+、盡責審議亦可施壓：要「齊人返工」就是建制派地獄&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，立法會有很多不同施壓的權力，如「盡責審議」本身亦會構成壓力。她舉例，何啟明曾提到民主派過半就是建制派地獄，但她認為無需民主派過半，「因為對建制派嚟講，地獄唔係熄佢咪或者趕佢出去，而係要建制派齊人返工」，旁聽席大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何微微轉向旁聽席舉起手指說：「呢個唔係一個笑話」，並解釋如民主派議員人數很多，達32或33人，「建制派就要確保佢永遠都夠人，否則一旦表決或點人數，好容易政府嘅法案就會推唔到。」何並指，以她跟進多年立會新聞的理解，「政府淨係要確保啲建制派議員喺特定嘅時刻齊人喺立法會唔好曠工，已經要好多嘅人力」，又舉例民主派取得34席，在財委會基本上已可否決所有議案。惟何表示，當時沒有討論如何可令政府回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指簽聲明是明確表態立會有否決權若dq是政府使橫手&quot;&gt;何指簽聲明是明確表態立會有否決權、若DQ是政府「使橫手」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問何桂藍為何決定簽「墨落無悔」，何解釋戴耀廷宣布毋須簽協議時，「我係非常之驚訝」，解釋因一旦宣布參與初選便等於參與正式選舉，要計選舉開支，故當時認為是6月尾才處理。惟何指當時還未談得攏，亦無人通知過她會有記者會和有此決定，戴就公開說毋須簽協議，而當時何根本不知道其他候選人對很多事情的立場，新東亦有多名預料會勝選的候選人無去協調會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何表示，認為問題仍在於「太害怕DQ」，指戴原本草擬「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」的條款，甚至無要求斬釘截鐵說會否決財案，而是承認《基本法》下立法會有此權力。何續說：「有乜理由去參選立法會，但係連立法會有咁樣嘅權力，都唔敢去確認？咁樣同你話就算我入到去，我乜都唔會做，乜都唔會反對，有乜嘢分別？所以我非常之唔認同。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，當時理解「墨落」是讓她明確表態，「至少我敢去公開要講呢句說話」，並指如她最後被DQ亦不是她問題，而是「政府連承認立法會有權否決財政預算案去爭取一個訴求，咁樣佢都容納唔到，要使橫手去DQ，所以我簽名」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指問題是太害怕dq-看重候選人是否因不合理紅線無底線褪後&quot;&gt;何指問題是「太害怕DQ」 看重候選人是否因不合理紅線「無底線褪後」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，控方開案陳詞指何透過簽署「墨落無悔」，「顯示堅定不移的決心進行謀劃」（“…show her determination to maintain unwavering insurgence in carrying out the Scheme”），問她有何回應？何指以她理解，「應該係巴勒斯坦有埋火箭砲嗰啲先叫得上 insurgence（叛亂）」，無法理解「投一個反對票就係 insurgence」，指「香港應該未出現過配得上呢個字嘅反抗行動囉」。法官陳仲衡則指，理解該字眼是在談及「35+計劃」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續同意，簽署「墨落」前已知道會被DQ，但她認為紅線並非否決財案，若純粹因建制媒體或建制派不斷攻擊而「咁大陣仗要避咗佢」，「好老實講，如果喺選之前都已經係咁樣，選完之後、《國安法》立完之後，又點樣期望唔願意作出呢個宣示（會運用基本法權力，包括否決財政預算案）嘅人，係願意作出一啲明確反抗嘅行為呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後問，由於何當時認為自己隨時被DQ，所以認為自己無甚機會成為議員？何肯定說：「冇機會。」李再問，所以她會認為無甚機會讓她行使權力，對預算案投反對票？何答：「冇錯。」惟何指，無論最後她本人能否投票否決，就「墨落無悔」她看重的，就是民主派候選人「係咪因為一啲唔合理嘅DQ紅線，個公開立場就要無底線咁褪後，我認為有一啲基本嘅立場係一定要向選民交代清楚嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何認同議會絕非抗爭終點-因不想給予民眾假希望&quot;&gt;何認同「議會絕非抗爭終點」 因不想給予民眾假希望&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問何對聲明中「我們深明議會絕非抗爭終點」的看法，何指以其理解，當時有候選人會直接將35+和落實五大訴求掛勾，但她認為會給予選民一種錯誤印象，「好似攞咗35個位就真係迫到政府做嘢咁。」但何指當時很多人都很清楚「35+係無可能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，她認同該句說話，「因為唔想畀民眾一個假嘅希望，令佢哋覺得立法會真係可以直接迫使到政府」，而她認為其他形式的抗爭都要繼續嘗試。何又指，這是一直以來香港民主運動的「慣性」，「就係雖然明知個議會冇乜嘢做到，但係都會講到個議會好重要，贏多幾席就真係會有啲嘢做到咁」，鄒家成聞言微笑和點頭。何續指，但這會造成選民「有種一勞永逸、投咗票就OK嘅感覺」，「所以我覺得要誠實，議會係冇辦法幫大家攞到五大訴求返嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指戴耀廷本身攬炒第八步才到國安法-惟第一步未開始已來臨&quot;&gt;何指戴耀廷本身「攬炒」第八步才到《國安法》 惟第一步未開始已來臨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，何提及的觀點，戴耀廷或其他初選組織者也抱持同樣看法嗎？何指，「我剛剛講嘅慣性嗰樣嘢其實就係『虛擬自由主義』，係好多年嚟對傳統民主派嘅批評」，林卓廷說「哇」，陳志全發笑，旁聽席亦傳來笑聲。陳慶偉重複問組織者是否抱持該看法，何問即什麼看法，陳指簡言之，即35+計劃是浪費時間和金錢，Beel 補充是立法會並不能達成任何事，包括五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指她並無表達過陳慶偉所指的看法，李運騰聞言皺眉掩臉，陳說那是他從何的答案所得出的結論。李指或可用何自己的說法，問戴耀廷等組織者是否也有「虛擬自由主義」的看法，何聽問題時忍不住發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，記得大規模DQ發生後，戴耀廷曾發文指35+已大功告成，大意是因為民主派未真的採取行動，「中共已經 overreact（過度反應）到咁嘅地步」，而《國安法》5月底宣布後，美國已即時取消香港特殊地位，何形容是很多人對「攬炒」的理解，故當時很多人說「中共已經率先炒晒全世界」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指35不可能在參與關注初選人中流傳甚廣&quot;&gt;何指「35+」不可能在參與關注初選人中流傳甚廣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時陳慶偉主動說，「我認為我們要休息」，指不認為何桂藍有回答問題，Beel 亦指「我需要休息」，指需時查看筆記。何在小休後，表明不想給予民眾假希望「係我由一開始參與初選以嚟嘅立場」，至於組織者是否抱持相同看法，何指戴耀廷的「攬炒十步」本身數到第八步才到《國安法》實施，「但係第一步都未開始，《國安法》就嚟咗喇」，而區諾軒6月亦曾撰文一方面熱切講初選，一方面亦提及多人被捕，不知自己明天會否被捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指，當時大家一邊辦初選，但「其實對於聽日發生咩事係唔知道嘅」，並認為當時在參與初選或關注討論初選的人中，「35+不可能」是頗流傳甚廣的說法，舉例6月的初選論壇她不斷問公民黨若「35-」怎辦，超區王百羽亦稱「35+傾嚟做乜鬼吖」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指戴耀廷曾指民主派會取46我哋凡人無法理解&quot;&gt;何指戴耀廷曾指民主派會取「46+」：我哋凡人無法理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於戴耀廷是否認為「35+」不可能？此時何舉起左手食指望着 Beel：「嗱大家如果覺得以下呢樣嘢好痴線唔係我嘅責任，我只係覆述返我當時見到戴耀廷講嘅嘢啫」，並指如她沒記錯，「戴耀廷呢個時候（5、6月左右）係喺啲報紙上面計緊40+嘅」，「佢甚至（在文章或公開場合）係話46+添」，陳志全等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 追問，所以戴認為35+不可能？何說：「我覺得我哋呢啲凡人係冇辦法理解戴耀廷係覺得乜嘢可能、乜嘢唔可能」，多人聞言發笑。何在追問下解釋，戴是以數據推算議席問題，如果只是看選民登記、看民主和建制相比，而不看政治現實，「我會理解到佢點解會覺得嗰啲嘢係可能。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何不同意墨落是抗爭派挑戰組織者夾傳統民主派-如感壓力是來自選民&quot;&gt;何不同意「墨落」是抗爭派挑戰組織者、「夾」傳統民主派 如感壓力是來自選民&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 最後問，何是否認為「墨落」是抗爭派試圖挑戰組織者，何不同意。Beel 問，那「墨落」是否抗爭派迫使傳統民主派採取相同立場？何指其他證人是用「夾」一字，並指當時如有其他政黨人士感受到壓力，該壓力並非直接來自抗爭派，因這是場選舉，最終都是看選民反應，而她理解當時選民「比較多都係唔認同一種無底線退讓嘅路線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，至於個別候選人想用自己理念說服這些選民其決定正確，抑或會受選民影響而採納「佢哋自己未必認同嘅立場」，是他們自己的「政治判斷」，「將呢樣嘢講成係其他人『夾』你或者逼你，我覺得就抽空咗選民意願嘅嗰一 part。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何最後指，這份聲明講到尾，就她個人理解，是讓候選人表達是否採納當中的兩點聲明立場，「至少我自己去簽嘅時候，我只係諗我自己要向選民交代一個乜嘢訊息，當時我腦入面冇諗到我要透過呢個行為去令到其他候選人點樣樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 表示就「墨落無悔」的部分完結，將就提名表格等發問。案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，今午本案認罪保釋被告呂智恆前來聽審，於午休時與何桂藍打招呼，並以手勢交流。社民連陳皓桓、記協主席陳朗昇等也有來旁聽，何一度問陳：「點解你喺度嘅？」&lt;/p&gt;
